'''Abraham Jacobus Wendel''' ([[Leiden]], 31 October 1826 - Leiden, 23 September 1915) was a Dutch [[lithographer]], [[draughtsman]] and scientific [[Botanical illustrator|botanical]] and [[paleontology|
paleontological]] [[illustrator]] using the signature AW.&lt;ref name=rkd&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/110212  Abraham Jacobus Wendel] in Dutch [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Abraham Jacobus Wendel was born in 1826 in Leiden as a son of Jacobus Cornelis Wendel (1796-1860) and Johanna Vegt (1801-1869). In 1849 he married Jannetje Koolen (1826-1904) and had six children, including Abraham Jacobus Johannes Wendel (Leiden, 9 July 1854 - 3 April 1930),&lt;ref name=genea&gt;[https://www.myheritage.nl/person-3000619_182835582_182835582/abraham-jacobus-wendel Abraham Jacobus Wendel] in myheritage.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.erfgoedleiden.nl/collecties/personen/zoek-op-personen/q/custom_text_persoon/Abraham%20Jacobus%20Johannes%20Wendel Erfgoedleiden.nl Abraham Jacobus Johannes Wendel]&lt;/ref&gt; who became a lithographer and botanical artist in his own right, using signature AJJW. His father Abraham Jacobus Wendel created the botanical illustrations  for many books and scientific journal articles. He was a lithographer with the printing house ''Arntz &amp; Co.'' in Leiden, and made the illustrations for W. H. De Vriese et al. ''Descriptions et figures des plantes nouvelles et rares'' (1847). In 1887 he worked with ''Boek- en steendrukkerij P.W.M. Trap'' in Leiden: both Wendel and Trap are acknowledged in volumes 6 and 7 of the ''Annales du [[Bogor Botanical Gardens|Jardin botanique de Buitenzorg]]'' (Ann.Jard.Bot.Btzg.).&lt;ref&gt;Database [[National Herbarium of the Netherlands]] (NHN, Naturalis Biodiversity Center), refer to [[w:c:List of artists in Category:Icones art collection at Naturalis Biodiversity Center|List of artists in Category:Icones art collection at Naturalis Biodiversity Center]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) fermentation''' is a process that uses bacterial [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] to produce [[acetone]], [[n-Butanol]], and [[ethanol]] from carbohydrates such as [[starch]] and [[glucose]]. It was developed by the [[chemist]] [[Chaim Weizmann]] and was the primary process used to make acetone during [[World War I]], such as to produce [[cordite]], a substance essential for the British war industry.&lt;ref name=wilkins /&gt;

==The process==
The process may be likened to how [[yeast]] ferments sugars to produce ethanol for wine, beer, or fuel, but the organisms that carry out the ABE fermentation are strictly [[:wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] (obligate anaerobes). The ABE fermentation produces solvents in a ratio of 3 parts acetone, 6 parts butanol to 1 part ethanol. It usually uses a strain of bacteria from the Class [[Clostridia]] (Family [[Clostridiaceae]]). ''[[Clostridium acetobutylicum]]'' is the most well-studied and widely used species, although ''[[Clostridium beijerinckii]]'' has also been used with good results.&lt;ref name=Qureshi /&gt;

For gas stripping, the most common gases used are the off-gases from the fermentation itself, a mixture of [[carbon dioxide]] and [[hydrogen]] gas.

==History==
The production of [[butanol]] by biological means was first performed by [[Louis Pasteur]] in 1861.

In 1905, Austrian biochemist Franz Schardinger found that acetone could similarly be produced.

In 1910 [[Auguste Fernbach]] (1860-1939) developed a bacterial fermentation process using potato starch as a feedstock in the production of butanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pasteur.fr/infosci/archives/frb0.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208164929/http://www.pasteur.fr/infosci/archives/frb0.html |archive-date=2014-12-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrial exploitation of ABE fermentation started in 1916, during World War I, with [[Chaim Weizmann]]'s isolation of Clostridium acetobutylicum, as described in U.S. patent 1315585.&lt;ref name=Weizmann1919/&gt;

The Weizmann process was operated by [[Commercial Solvents Corporation]] from about 1920 to 1964 with plants in the US ([[Terre Haute, IN]], and [[Peoria, IL]]), and [[Liverpool, England]]. The Peoria plant was the largest of the three; it used [[molasses]] as feedstock and had 96 50,000-gallon fermenters.&lt;ref name=Kelly /&gt;

After World War II, ABE fermentation became generally non-profitable, compared to the production of the same three solvents (acetone, butanol, ethanol) from petroleum.&lt;ref name=wilkins/&gt;

During the 1950s and 1960s, ABE fermentation was replaced by petroleum chemical plants. Due to different raw material costs, ABE fermentation was viable in [[South Africa]] until the early 1980s, with the last plant closing in 1983.{Jones and Woods 1986}

Currently there is one ABE plant operated by Green Biologics Ltd in Minnesota.&lt;ref name="greenbiologics.com"&gt;http://www.greenbiologics.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improvement attempts===
In order to make ABE fermentation profitable, many in-situ product recovery systems have been developed. These include [[gas stripping]], [[pervaporation]], [[membrane distillation]], [[adsorption]], and [[reverse osmosis]]. Green Biologics Ltd has implemented this at an industrial scale.&lt;ref name="greenbiologics.com"/&gt;

===Current perspectives===
ABE fermentation is attracting renewed interest with an eye on [[Butanol fuel|butanol as a renewable biofuel]].&lt;ref name=nationalgeographic2013 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15497">'''Attribute substitution''', also known as '''Substitution bias''', is a psychological process thought to underlie a number of [[cognitive bias]]es and [[optical illusion|perceptual illusions]]. It occurs when an individual has to make a judgment (of a ''target attribute'') that is computationally complex, and instead substitutes a more easily calculated ''[[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristic]] attribute''.&lt;ref name="newell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Newell |first=Benjamin R. |first2=David A. |last2=Lagnado |first3=David R. |last3=Shanks  |title=Straight choices: the psychology of decision making |publisher=Routledge |year=2007 |pages=71–74 |isbn=978-1-84169-588-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This substitution is thought of as taking place in the automatic ''intuitive'' judgment system, rather than the more self-aware ''reflective'' system. Hence, when someone tries to answer a difficult question, they may actually answer a related but different question, without realizing that a substitution has taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Associative processes in intuitive judgment|url = http://www.cell.com/article/S1364661310001713/abstract|journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date = 2010-01-10|issn = 1364-6613|pmid = 20696611|pages = 435–440|volume = 14|issue = 10|doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2010.07.004|language = English|first = Carey K.|last = Morewedge|first2 = Daniel|last2 = Kahneman|pmc = 5378157}}&lt;/ref&gt; This explains why individuals can be unaware of their own biases, and why biases persist even when the subject is made aware of them. It also explains why human judgments often fail to show [[regression toward the mean]].&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;

The theory of attribute substitution unifies a number of separate explanations of reasoning errors in terms of [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|cognitive heuristics]].&lt;ref name="newell"/&gt; In turn, the theory is subsumed by an ''effort-reduction framework'' proposed by Anuj K. Shah and [[Daniel M. Oppenheimer]], which states that people use a variety of techniques to reduce the effort of making decisions.&lt;ref name="shah2008"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Daniel KAHNEMAN.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Daniel Kahneman]]]]
In a 1974 paper, psychologists [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] argued that a broad family of biases (systematic errors in judgment and decision) were explainable in terms of a few heuristics (information-processing shortcuts), including [[availability heuristic|availability]] and [[representativeness heuristic|representativeness]]. In a 2002 revision of the theory, Kahneman and [[Shane Frederick]] proposed attribute substitution as a process underlying these and other effects.&lt;ref name="revisited"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kahneman |first=Daniel |first2=Shane |last2=Frederick  |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment |editor=Thomas Gilovich |editor2=Dale Griffin |editor3=Daniel Kahneman |publisher =Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=49–81 |chapter=Representativeness Revisited: Attribute Substitution in Intuitive Judgment |isbn=978-0-521-79679-8 |oclc=47364085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, psychologist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] proposed that the strength of a stimulus (e.g., the brightness of a light, the severity of a crime) is encoded neurally in a way that is independent of [[stimulus modality|modality]]. Kahneman and Frederick built on this idea, arguing that the target attribute and heuristic attribute could be unrelated.&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;

== Conditions ==
{{Quote box |quote=[P]eople are not accustomed to thinking hard, and are often content to trust a plausible judgment that comes to mind. |source=[[Daniel Kahneman]], ''American Economic Review'' '''93''' (5) December 2003, p. 1450 |width=30% |align=right}}
Kahneman and Frederick propose three conditions for attribute substitution:&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;
# The target attribute is relatively inaccessible. Substitution is not expected to take place in answering factual questions that can be retrieved directly from memory ("What is your birthday?") or about current experience ("Do you feel thirsty now?).
# An associated attribute is highly accessible. This might be because it is evaluated automatically in normal perception or because it has been [[priming (psychology)|primed]]. For example, someone who has been thinking about their love life who is then asked about their happiness might substitute how happy they are with their love life rather than answer the question as asked.
# The substitution is not detected and corrected by the reflective system. For example, when asked "A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?" many subjects incorrectly answer $0.10.&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |date=December 2003 |title=Maps of Bounded Rationality: Psychology for Behavioral Economics |journal= American Economic Review |publisher=American Economic Association |volume=93 |issue=5 |pages=1449–1475 |doi=10.1257/000282803322655392 |issn=0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt; An explanation in terms of attribute substitution is that, rather than work out the sum, subjects parse the sum of $1.10 into a large amount and a small amount, which is easy to do. Whether they feel that is the right answer will depend on whether they check the calculation with their reflective system.

==Examples==
[[File:Opt taeuschung groesse.jpg|thumb|225px|right|This illusion works because 3D (perspective) size is substituted for 2D size (all pairs are equal in size)]]

===Optical illusions===
Attribute substitution explains the persistence of some illusions. For example, when subjects judge the size of two figures in a [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] picture, their apparent sizes can be distorted by the 3D context, making a convincing optical illusion. The theory states that the three-dimensional size of the figure (which is accessible because it is automatically computed by the visual system) is substituted for its two-dimensional size on the page. Experienced painters and photographers are less susceptible to this illusion, because the two-dimensional size is more accessible to their perception.&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"/&gt;

===Valuing insurance===
Kahneman gives an example where some Americans were offered [[insurance]] against their own death in a terrorist attack while on a trip to Europe, while another group were offered insurance that would cover death of any kind on the trip. The former group were willing to pay more even though "death of any kind" includes "death in a terrorist attack", Kahneman suggests that the attribute of [[fear]] is being substituted for a calculation of the total risks of travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/kahneman07/kahneman07_index.html |title=Short Course in Thinking About Thinking |last= Kahneman |first=Daniel |year=2007 |work=Edge.org |publisher=Edge Foundation |accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of terrorism for these subjects was stronger than a general fear of dying on a foreign trip.

===Stereotypes===
[[Stereotypes]] can be a source of heuristic attributes.&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt; In a face-to-face conversation with a stranger, judging their intelligence is more computationally complex than judging the colour of their skin. So if the subject has a [[stereotype]] about the relative [[intelligence]] of whites, blacks, and Asians, that racial attribute might substitute for the more intangible attribute of intelligence. The pre-conscious, intuitive nature of attribute substitution explains how subjects can be influenced by the stereotype while thinking that they have made an honest, unbiased evaluation of the other person's intelligence.

===Morality and fairness===
[[Cass Sunstein|Sunstein]] argued that attribute substitution is pervasive when people reason about [[morality|moral]], [[political]], or [[legal]] matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sunstein |first=Cass R. |year=2005 |title=Moral Heuristics |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |publisher=Cambridge University Press |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages= 531–542 |issn=0140-525X |doi=10.1017/S0140525X05000099 |pmid= 16209802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given a difficult, novel problem in these areas, people search for a more familiar, related problem (a "prototypical case") and apply its solution as the solution to the harder problem. According to Sunstein, the opinions of [[Authority bias|trusted]] political or religious [[Argument from authority|authorities]] can serve as heuristic attributes when people are asked their own opinions on a matter. Another source of heuristic attributes is [[emotion]]: people's moral opinions on sensitive subjects like [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[human cloning]] may be driven by reactions such as [[disgust]], rather than by reasoned principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sunstein |first=Cass R. |year=2009 |title=Some Effects of Moral Indignation on Law |journal=Vermont Law Review |publisher=Vermont Law School |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=405–434 |url=http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/articles/3/12%20Sunstein%20Book%203%2C%20Vol.%2033.pdf |accessdate=2009-09-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610021623/http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/articles/3/12%20Sunstein%20Book%203%2C%20Vol.%2033.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics demanded more evidence from Sunstein.&lt;ref name="shah2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shah |first=Anuj K. |author-link2=Daniel M. Oppenheimer|first2=Daniel M.|last2=Oppenheimer  |date=March 2008 |title=Heuristics Made Easy: An Effort-Reduction Framework |journal=Psychological Bulletin |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=134 |issue=2 |pages=207–222 |issn=1939-1455 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.134.2.207 |pmid=18298269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The beautiful-is-familiar effect===
Monin reports a series of experiments in which subjects, looking at photographs of faces, have to judge whether they have seen those faces before. It is repeatedly found that attractive faces are more likely to be mistakenly labeled as familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Monin |first=Benoît |first2=Daniel M.|last2=Oppenheimer |year=2005 |title=Correlated Averages vs. Averaged Correlations: Demonstrating the Warm Glow Heuristic Beyond Aggregation |journal=Social Cognition |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=257–278 |issn=0278-016X |url=http://web.princeton.edu/sites/opplab/papers/Opp%20Demonstrating%20the%20Warm%20Glow%20Heuristic.pdf |doi=10.1521/soco.2005.23.3.257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monin interprets this result in terms of attribute substitution. The heuristic attribute in this case is a "warm glow"; a positive feeling towards someone that might either be due to their being familiar or being attractive. This interpretation has been criticised, because not all the [[variance]] in the familiarity data is accounted for by attractiveness.&lt;ref name="shah2008"/&gt;

==Evidence==
The most direct evidence, according to Kahneman,&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"/&gt; is a 1973 experiment that used a psychological profile of Tom&amp;nbsp;W., a fictional graduate student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |first2=Amos |last2=Tversky |date=July 1973 |title=On the Psychology of Prediction |journal=Psychological Review |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=237–51 |issn= 0033-295X |doi=10.1037/h0034747}}&lt;/ref&gt; One group of subjects had to rate Tom's ''similarity'' to a typical student in each of nine academic areas (Law, Engineering, Library Science etc.). Another group had to rate ''how likely'' it is that Tom specialised in each area. If these ratings of likelihood are governed by [[probability]], then they should resemble the [[base rates]], i.e., the proportion of students in each of the nine areas (which had been separately estimated by a third group). A probabilistic judgment would say that Tom is more likely to be a Humanities student than Library Science, because many more students study Humanities, and the additional information in the profile is vague and unreliable. Instead, the ratings of likelihood matched the ratings of similarity almost perfectly, both in this study and a similar one where subjects judged the likelihood of a fictional woman taking different careers. This suggests that rather than estimating probability using base rates, subjects had substituted the more accessible attribute of similarity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10347">The '''Bohr–Kramers–Slater theory''' (BKS theory) was perhaps the final attempt at understanding the interaction of matter and electromagnetic radiation on the basis of the so-called [[old quantum theory]], in which quantum phenomena are treated by imposing quantum restrictions on classically describable behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;N. Bohr, Collected Works, J. Kalckar, ed. North-Holland, Amsterdam, etc., 1985, Vol. 5, pp. 3-216.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Mehra and H. Rechenberg, The historical development of quantum theory, Springer-Verlag, New York, etc., 1982, Vol. 1, Part 2, pp. 532-554.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Bohr, H.A. Kramers, and J.C. Slater, Phil. Mag. '''47''', 785-802 (1924) (German version: Zeitschr. f. Physik '''24''', 69-87 (1924)).&lt;/ref&gt; It was advanced in 1924, and sticks to a ''classical'' wave description of the electromagnetic field. It was perhaps more a research program than a full physical theory, the ideas that are developed not being worked out in a quantitative way. &lt;ref name=Pais1993&gt;{{cite book|author=Abraham Pais|title=Niels Bohr's Times: In Physics, Philosophy, and Polity|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-852049-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|236}}

One aspect, the idea of modelling atomic behaviour under incident electromagnetic radiation using "virtual oscillators" at the absorption and emission frequencies, rather than the (different) apparent frequencies of the Bohr orbits, significantly led [[Max Born|Born]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] and [[Hendrik Kramers|Kramers]] to explore mathematics that strongly inspired the subsequent development of [[matrix mechanics]], the first form of modern [[quantum mechanics]]. The provocativeness of the theory also generated great discussion and renewed attention to the difficulties in the foundations of the old quantum theory.&lt;ref name="Jammer p188"&gt;[[Max Jammer]], ''Conceptual Development of Quantum Mechanics'', 2e, 1989, p.188&lt;/ref&gt;  However, physically the most provocative element of the theory, that momentum and energy would not necessarily be conserved in each interaction but only overall, statistically, was soon shown to be in conflict with experiment.

== Origins ==
The initial idea of the BKS theory originated with [[John C. Slater|Slater]],&lt;ref&gt;Letters from J.C. Slater, November, December 1923, reprinted in Ref. 1, pp. 8, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; who proposed to [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]] and [[Hendrik Anthony Kramers|Kramers]] the following elements of a theory of emission and absorption of radiation by atoms, to be developed during his stay in Copenhagen: 
# Emission and absorption of electromagnetic radiation by matter is realized in agreement with [[Albert Einstein#General relativity|Einstein]]'s [[photon]] concept;
# A photon emitted by an atom is guided by a classical electromagnetic field (compare [[Louis de Broglie|de Broglie]]'s ideas published September 1923 &lt;ref&gt;L. de Broglie, Comptes Rendues '''177''', 507-510 (1923).&lt;/ref&gt;) consisting of spherical waves, thus enabling to explain [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]];
# Even when there are no transitions there exists a classical field to which all atoms contribute; this field contains all frequencies at which an atom can emit or absorb a photon, the [[probability]] of such an emission being determined by the amplitude of the corresponding [[Fourier analysis#Applications in signal processing|Fourier component]] of the field; the probabilistic aspect is provisional, to be eliminated when the dynamics of the inside of atoms are better known;
# The classical field is not produced by the actual motions of the electrons but by `motions with the frequencies of possible [[Spectral line|emission and absorption lines]]' (to be called '''virtual'' oscillators', creating a field to be referred to as 'virtual' as well).

== Development with Bohr and Kramers ==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2018}}Slater's main intention seems to have been to reconcile the two conflicting models of radiation, viz. the [[Wave–particle duality|wave and particle models]]. He may have had good hopes that his idea with respect to oscillators vibrating at the ''differences'' of the frequencies of electron rotations (rather than at the rotation frequencies themselves) might be attractive to Bohr because it solved a problem of the latter's [[Bohr model#History|atomic model]], even though the physical meaning of these oscillators was far from clear. Nevertheless, Bohr and Kramers had two objections to Slater's proposal: 
# The assumption that photons exist. Even though Einstein's photon hypothesis could explain in a simple way the [[photoelectric effect]], as well as [[conservation of energy]] in processes of de-[[Excited state|excitation]] of an atom followed by excitation of a neighboring one, Bohr had always been reluctant to accept the reality of photons, his main argument being the problem of reconciling the existence of photons with the phenomenon of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]];
# The impossibility to account for [[conservation of energy]] in a process of de-excitation of an atom followed by excitation of a neighboring one. This impossibility followed from Slater's probabilistic assumption, which did not imply any [[correlation]] between processes going on in different atoms.
As Jammer puts it, this refocussed the theory "to harmonize the physical picture of the continuous electromagnetic field with the physical picture, not as Slater had proposed of light quanta, but of the discontinuous quantum transitions in the atom."&lt;ref name="Jammer p188" /&gt;  Bohr and Kramers hoped to be able to evade the photon hypothesis on the basis of ongoing work by Kramers to describe "dispersion" (in present-day terms [[inelastic scattering]]) of light by means of a classical theory of interaction of radiation and matter.  But abandoning the concept of the photon, they instead chose to squarely accept the possibility of non-conservation of energy, and momentum.

== Experimental counter-evidence==
In the BKS paper the [[Compton scattering#The Compton shift formula|Compton effect]] was discussed as an application of the idea of "''statistical'' conservation of energy and momentum" in a continuous process of scattering of radiation by a [[Sample (material)|sample]] of free electrons, where "each of the electrons contributes through the emission of  coherent secondary wavelets". Although Compton had already given an attractive account of his experiment on the basis of the photon picture (including conservation of energy and momentum in ''individual'' scattering processes), is it stated in the BKS paper that "it seems at the present state of science hardly justifiable to reject a formal interpretation as that under consideration [i.e. the weaker assumption of ''statistical'' conservation] as inadequate". This statement may have prompted experimental physicists to improve `the present state of science' by testing the hypothesis of `statistical energy and momentum conservation'. In any case, already after one year the BKS theory was disproved by experiments studying correlations between the directions into which the emitted radiation and the recoil electron are emitted in individual scattering processes. Such experiments were independently performed by [[Walther Bothe|Bothe]] and [[Hans Geiger|Geiger]],&lt;ref&gt;W. Bothe and H. Geiger, Zeitschr. f. Phys.
'''26''', 44 (1924); Naturwiss. '''13''', 440-441 (1925).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by [[Arthur Compton|Compton]] and Simon.&lt;ref&gt;A.H. Compton, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. '''11''', 303-306 (1925); A.H. Compton and A.W. Simon, Phys. Rev. '''26''', 289-299 (1925).&lt;/ref&gt; They provided experimental evidence pointing in the direction of energy and momentum conservation in individual scattering processes (at least, it was shown that the BKS theory was not able to explain the experimental results). More accurate experiments, performed much later, have also confirmed these results.&lt;ref&gt;R. Hofstadter and J.A. McIntyre, Phys. Rev. '''78''', 24-28 (1950).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.G. Cross and [[Norman Foster Ramsey, Jr.|N.F. Ramsey]], Phys. Rev. '''80''', 929-936 (1950).&lt;/ref&gt;

As suggested by a letter to [[Max Born|Born]],&lt;ref&gt;Letter of April 29, 1924 in: The Born-Einstein Letters, Correspondence between Albert Einstein and Max and Hedwig Born from 1916 to 1955 with commentaries by Max Born, Walker and Company, New York, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; for Einstein the corroboration of energy and momentum conservation was probably even more important than his photon hypothesis: "Bohr's opinion of radiation interests me very much. But I don't want to let myself be driven to a renunciation of strict causality before there has been a much stronger resistance against it than up to now. I cannot bear the thought that an electron exposed to a ray should by its own free decision choose the moment and the direction in which it wants to jump away. If so, I'd rather be a cobbler or even an employee in a gambling house than a physicist. It is true that my attempts to give the quanta palpable shape have failed again and again, but I'm not going to give up hope for a long time yet." 

Bohr's reaction, too, was not primarily related to the photon hypothesis. According to [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]],&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Mehra, quoted in Ref. 2, p. 554&lt;/ref&gt; Bohr remarked: "Even if Einstein sends me a cable that an irrevocable proof of the physical existence of light-quanta has now been found, the message cannot reach me, because it has to be transmitted by electromagnetic waves." For Bohr the lesson to be learned from the disproof of the BKS theory was not that photons do exist, but rather that the applicability of classical space-time pictures in understanding phenomena within the quantum domain is limited. This theme would become particularly important a few years later in developing the notion of [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]]. According to Heisenberg, [[Born probability|Born's statistical interpretation]] also had its ultimate roots in the BKS theory. Hence, despite its failure the BKS theory still provided an important contribution to the revolutionary transition from classical mechanics to [[quantum mechanics]].

'''Boris Rtcheouloff / Rcheulishvili''' ({{lang-ka|'''ბორის რჩეულიშვილი'''}}) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[scientist]], and the [[inventor]] of “[[videotape]]”.&lt;ref&gt;US Consumer Electronics Industry Today (Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Early attempts to record television signals on magnetic material had started when Boris Rtcheouloff applied for a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[patent]] on [[January 1927|4 January 1927]]&lt;ref&gt;Paul McDonald, ''Video and DVD industries'' (British Film Institute, 22 Jan 2008) p.20&lt;/ref&gt; for a technique of [[Video recording|recording]] [[television]] signals on 'a magnetic record of the [[Valdemar Poulsen|Poulsen]] telegraphone type'.&lt;ref&gt;George Shiers and May Shiers, ''Early Television: A Bibliographic Guide to 1940'' (Taylor and Francis, 1997) p.69&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sound]] would be recorded in sync on the reverse side. These ideas incorporated a way to record sound or pictures by causing a strip, disc, or cylinder of iron or other [[magnet]]ic material to be magnetized. He did not pay the annual renewal fee, so his patent soon lapsed.&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist, (Vol. 100, No. 1386, Dec 1983) p.666&lt;/ref&gt;

Casa Viva seeks to place children who have been separated from their families into a safe, caring family. Casa Viva is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for “Living Families” or “Living Homes.” The model of international child care that Casa Viva has created:
*Doesn’t rely on ongoing American funding
*Is nationally based
*Uses the social network of [[Christian]] churches to identify and train families
Casa Viva primarily cares for [[social orphan]]s, and also cares for true [[orphans]].

==Casa Viva’s History==
In 1998 Philip and Jill Aspegren moved to the [[Dominican Republic]] to build an orphanage and train nationals to care for the children there with [[Kids Alive]]. But there had to be a better way: a less expensive, less institutional, quicker way to care for children internationally. They began to dream of a childcare model that does not require new buildings and that places children in families rather than in homes.

Moving to [[Costa Rica]] in 2005 they began to network with local churches, recruiting families belonging to those churches to care for children. Children who have been separated from their biological families are placed in families on a short term basis while their family is identified and counseled. Children are also placed in Casa Viva homes long term when it is impossible for the child to be reunited with their biological family. Children placed in a Casa Viva home have the advantage of growing up in a home that is surrounded by [[extended family]], [[local church]], and the support of the Casa Viva center.

==Casa Viva Today==
There are currently two Casa Viva Communities in [[Costa Rica]] - one in Eastern San Jose and a second in Grecia. In partnership with the Viva Network and Toybox it has identified [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Mexico]] and [[Paraguay]] as the next sites of multiplication.

===Developing Family Based Child Care International===
====Alternative to Orphanages====
Orphanages, whether private or government run, are institutions that are expensive to run and the good ones often become inundated with children sent there by the authorities. This reduces the quality of care and leaves the institution and its staff overworked and under equipped. While the physical needs of the child are met, often psychological needs of a child, the privacy of a child, and integration into their home culture are found to be lacking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethechildren.net/alliance/resources/last_res.pdf Save The Children: A Last Resort] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907101844/http://www.savethechildren.net/alliance/resources/last_res.pdf |date=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led Casa Viva to begin creating a program, similar to England and the United States' [[foster care]] model, but with two primary differences:
*Church based
*Little financial incentive
In some cases, the financial benefit of already-established government-based fostering has become a primary motivator for families to be host foster families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingtheveil.org/foster07.htm Lifting the Veil on Foster Care]&lt;/ref&gt; Casa Viva does help families cover the cost of caring for the child but relies heavily on Biblical motivation and mandates to care for the orphan in need.

====Children Raised in Families====
It has been shown that children raised in orphanages do not develop as well physically, cognitively or emotionally as children raised in family based settings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_4_38/ai_n15338080 The House, The Street, Global Society: Latin American families and childhood in the twenty-first century]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Patent law}}
A '''chemical patent''', '''pharmaceutical patent''' or '''drug patent''' is a [[patent]] for an invention in the [[chemical industry|chemical]] or [[pharmaceuticals industry]]. Strictly speaking, in most jurisdictions, there are essentially no differences between the legal requirements to obtain a patent for an invention in the chemical or pharmaceutical fields, in comparison to obtaining a patent in the other fields, such as in the mechanical field. A chemical patent or a pharmaceutical patent is therefore ''not'' a ''[[sui generis]]'' right, i.e. a special legal type of patent.

In the pharmaceutical industry, the patent protection of drugs and medicines is accorded a particular importance, because drugs and medicines can easily be copied or imitated (by analyzing a pharmaceutical substance) and because of the significant [[research and development]] spending and the high risks associated with the development of a new drug.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Gassmann, Gerrit Reepmeyer, Maximilian von Zedtwitz, Leading Pharmaceutical Innovation, Trends and Drivers for Growth in the Pharmaceutical Industry, Springer, 2008, {{ISBN|3-540-77635-4}}, {{ISBN|978-3-540-77635-2}}, pages 133-134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scherer FM., [http://www.econ.canterbury.ac.nz/personal_pages/john_fountain/Teaching/HealthEcon/reading/scherereconhumangenepatents.pdf The economics of human gene patents] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425123833/http://www.econ.canterbury.ac.nz/personal_pages/john_fountain/Teaching/HealthEcon/reading/scherereconhumangenepatents.pdf |date=April 25, 2012 }}, Acad Med. 2002 Dec;77(12 Pt 2):1348-67 : "
* ''For one, in pharmaceuticals, as in organic and agricultural chemicals, patent claims tend to define products especially precisely. ...
* ''Second, once a particular molecule is identified as a potentially effective therapeutic medium, it must be carried through expensive clinical trials to prove its safety and efficacy. ...
* ''Third, absent patent protection or regulatory barriers to imitation, imitators might spend a very few million dollars on product formulation, process development, and clinical trials (typically on 24 human subjects) required to prove therapeutic equivalence and bring their generic substitutes onto the market in competition with the company that has incurred huge discovery and clinical testing costs. ...
''It is for these three reasons together that patents are accorded such high importance by pharmaceutical manufacturers.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"''... patents are key in the pharmaceutical sector, as they allow companies to recoup their often very considerable investments and to be rewarded for their innovative efforts''" in European Commission, [http://ec.europa.eu/competition/sectors/pharmaceuticals/inquiry/preliminary_report.pdf Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry, Preliminary Report (DG Competition Staff Working Paper)], 28 November 2008, page 5 (pdf, 1.95 MB).&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical patents are different from other sources of technical information because of the generic, [[Markush structures]] contained within them, named after the inventor [[Eugene Markush]] who won a claim in the US in 1925 to allow such structures to be used in [[patent claim]]s.  These generic structures are used to make the patent claim as broad as possible.

In the United States, patents on pharmaceuticals were considered unethical by the medical profession during most of the nineteenth-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medical Monopoly: Intellectual Property and the Origins of the Modern Pharmaceutical Industry|last=Gabriel|first=Joseph|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2014|isbn=9780226108186|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3691">'''Chopart's fracture–dislocation''' is a [[Joint dislocation|dislocation]] of the [[Transverse tarsal joint|mid-tarsal]] ([[talonavicular joint|talonavicular]] and [[calcaneocuboid joint|calcaneocuboid]]) joints of the [[foot]], often with associated [[Bone fracture|fractures]] of the [[calcaneus]], [[Cuboid bone|cuboid]] and [[Navicular bone|navicular]].&lt;ref name=learn&gt;[http://www.learningradiology.com/archives06/COW%20221-Choparts%20fracture/chopartsccorrect.html Chopart's Fracture Dislocation] at LearningRadiology.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism of injury ==
Chopart's fracture–dislocation is usually caused by falls from height, [[traffic collision]]s and twisting injuries to the foot as seen in [[basketball]] players.

== Injury patterns ==
* The foot is usually dislocated [[Human anatomical terms#Anatomical directions|medially]] (80%) and superiorly, which occurs when the foot is [[Plantarflexion|plantar flexed]] and [[Inversion (kinesiology)|inverted]].
* Lateral displacement occurs during [[Eversion (kinesiology)|eversion]] injuries.
* Associated fractures of calcaneus, cuboid and navicular are frequent.
* Open fractures occur in a small percentage.

== Diagnosis and treatment ==
Diagnosis is made on plain radiograph of the foot, although the extent of injury is often underestimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Swords |first=MP |author= |authorlink= |author2=Schramski M|author3=Switzer K|author4=Nemec S |date= Dec 2008|title=Chopart fractures and dislocations |trans_title= |journal=Foot Ankle Clin. |volume=13 |series= |issue=4 |page= |pages=679–93, viii |publisher= |location= |pmid=19013402 |pmc= |doi= 10.1016/j.fcl.2008.08.004|bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url= |language= |format=  |laysummary= |laysource= |laydate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment comprises early reduction of the dislocation, and frequently involves [[open reduction internal fixation]] to restore and stabilise the talonavicular joint. Open reduction and fusion of the calcaneocuboid joint is occasionally required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klaue |first=K |author= |authorlink= |date= Sep 2004|title=Chopart fractures |trans_title= |journal=Injury |volume=35 Suppl 2 |series= |issue= 2|page= |pages=SB64–70 |publisher= |location= |pmid=15315880 |pmc= |doi= 10.1016/j.injury.2004.07.013|bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url= |language= |format=  |laysummary= |laysource= |laydate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prognosis ==
With prompt treatment, particularly open reduction, and early mobilisation the outcome is generally good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Richter |first=M |author= |authorlink= |author2=Wippermann B|author3=Krettek C|author4=Schratt HE|author5=Hufner T|author6=Therman H |date= May 2001|title=Fractures and fracture dislocations of the midfoot: occurrence, causes and long-term results |trans_title= |journal=Foot Ankle Int. |volume=22 |series= |issue=5 |page= |pages=392–8 |publisher= |location= |pmid=11428757 |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url= |language= |format=  |laysummary= |laysource= |laydate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; High energy injuries and associated fractures worsen the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kumagai |first=S |author= |authorlink= |author2=Fitzgibbons TC|author3=McMullen ST|author4=Heiser D |date= Apr 1996|title=Chopart's fracture dislocation: a case report and review of the literature |trans_title= |journal=Nebr Med J |volume=81 |series= |issue=4 |page= |pages=116–9 |publisher= |location= |pmid=8628450 |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url= |language= |format= |accessdate= |laysummary= |laysource= |laydate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1126">In the pre-modern [[chemistry]] of [[Paracelsus]], a '''clyssus''', or '''clissus''', was one of the effects, or productions of that art; consisting of the most efficacious [[principle (chemistry)|principle]]s of any body, extracted, purified, and then remixed.

Or, a clyssus is when the several constituents of a body are prepared and purified separately, and then combined again. Thus, the five [[principle (chemistry)|principle]]s, reassembled into one body, by long digestion, make a clyssus. So, ''clyssus of antimony'' is produced by [[distillation]] from [[antimony]], [[nitre]], and [[sulfur]] mixed together. There is also ''clyssus of vitriol'', which is a spirit drawn by distillation from [[vitriol]] dissolved in [[vinegar]]; this was used by pre-modern physicians in treating various diseases, and to extract the [[tincture]]s of several vegetables.

Clyssus is used among some authors for a kind of ''sapa'', or extract, made with eight parts of the [[juice]] of a plant, and one of [[sugar]], seethed together into the consistency of [[honey]].

'''DNA banking''' is the secure, long term storage of an individual’s [[genetic material]]. [[DNA]] is most commonly extracted from [[blood]], but can also be obtained from [[saliva]] and other [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]. DNA banks allow for conservation of genetic material and comparative analysis of an individual's genetic information. Analyzing an individual's DNA can allow scientists to predict [[genetic disorders]], as used in preventative genetics or [[gene therapy]], and prove that person's identity, as used in the [[criminal justice system]]. There are multiple methods for testing and analyzing genetic information including [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP) and [[Polymerase chain reaction|polymerase chain reactions]] (PCR).
 
==Uses==

DNA banking is used to conserve genetic material, especially that of organisms that face [[extinction]]. This is a more prominent issue today due to [[deforestation]] and [[climate change]], which serve as a threat to [[biodiversity]]. The genetic information can be stored within [[lambda phage]] and plasma vectors. The National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences (NIAS) DNA Bank, for example, collects the DNA of agricultural organisms, such as rice and fish, for scientific research. Most DNA provided by DNA banks is used for studies to attempt to develop more productive or more environmentally friendly agricultural species. Some DNA banks also store the DNA of rare or [[endangered species]] to ensure their survival.&lt;ref&gt;Meurant, Gerard (2012). Conservation of Plant Genes : Dna Banking and in Vitro Biotechnology.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DNA bank can be used to compare and analyze DNA samples. Comparison of DNA samples allowed scientists to work on the [[Human Genome Project]], which maps out many of the genes on human DNA. It has also led to the development of preventative genetics. Samples from the DNA bank have been used to identify patterns and determine which genes lead to specific disorders. Once people know which genes lead to disorders, people can take steps to lessen the effects of that disorder. This can occur through adjustments in lifestyle, as demonstrated in [[preventive healthcare]], or even through gene therapy. DNA can be banked at any time during a person's life.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, A. (2007). Genetics, health care, and public policy: An introduction to public health genetics. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA banks were introduced to the criminal justice system in the 1980s. This system makes it possible to rule out or confirm the verdict of a suspect based on their personal genetic code. Once an individual’s DNA is stored, it remains in the system permanently; allowing law enforcement to identify and track criminals more easily. There is some controversy about this topic as some individuals believe the storage of citizen's DNA is an invasion of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Krimsky, S., &amp; Simoncelli, T. (2011). Genetic justice: DNA data banks, criminal investigations, and civil liberties. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA banking capsules are also starting to be used for retaining the DNA of the deceased, a service offered by some funeral homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/os-dna-collection-after-death-20150814-story.html |date=23 August 2015 |author=Jessica Inman |title=DNA collection allows mourning to memorialize the dead |work=Orlando Sentinel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processes==

Scientists are capable of retrieving genetic information from [[hair]], [[skin]], blood, [[sperm]], tissue, and saliva as long as the sample contains intact DNA. [[Nucleotide sequences]] between humans differ by only 0.1%. Even so, this 0.1% includes approximately three million bases.  DNA can be analyzed through restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and Polymerase chain reactions (PCR). The RFLP process was introduced in 1988. Restriction enzymes digest portions of the DNA, leaving short fragments. These fragments are sorted through gel [[electrophoresis]]. The gel demonstrates the length of the fragments allowing specialists to determine whether the fragments came from the same  person. PCR is more commonly used today because it more efficient and requires smaller samples of genetic samples. &lt;ref&gt;Stewart, A. (2007). Genetics, health care, and public policy: An introduction to public health genetics. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==

There are various organizations founded for the purpose of storing and analyzing DNA sample. For example, the [[UK Biobank]] contains DNA samples of 500,000 individuals aged between 40 and 69 when their samples were taken in the years 2006-2010 .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/11/what-happens-when-you-put-500000-peoples-dna-online/543747/|title=What Happens When You Put 500,000 People's DNA Online|last=Zhang|first=Sarah|date=2017-11-06|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609184/uk-biobank-supercharges-medicine-with-gene-data-on-500000-brits/|title=UK Biobank supercharges medicine with gene data on 500,000 Brits|last=Regalado|first=Antonio|date=2017-11-15|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Daneshmand''''' (meaning ''Scientist'' in English) is a [[wikt:Monthly|monthly]] [[general science]] [[magazine]] covering recent developments in [[science]] and [[technology]] for a general [[Persian language|Persian]]-speaking audience. The magazine is published in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]].

==History and profile==
Founded in 1963,&lt;ref name=impd&gt;{{cite web|title=Daneshmand|url=http://iranmediaresearch.org/en/wiki/article/1058|publisher=Iran Media Program|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Daneshmand'' was published by Novin Daneshmand organization, a subsidiary of Reed Elsevier. Ali Akbar Ghazvini served as the [[editor-in-chief]] of the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nobel Prize interviews|url=http://kouroshziabari.com/category/nobel-prize-interviews/|work=Kourosh Ziabari|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979 the magazine was closed.&lt;ref name=impd/&gt; In 1984 it was restarted under the ownership of the [[Mostazafen Foundation of Islamic Revolution]].&lt;ref name=impd/&gt; 

''Daneshmand'' is published on a monthly basis.&lt;ref name=impd/&gt; It has its headquarters in Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pirouz Mojtahed-Zadeh|title=Boundary Politics and International Boundaries of Iran: A Study of the Origin, Evolution, and Implications of the Boundaries of Modern Iran with Its 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9o0IRPpvDjkC&amp;pg=PA26|accessdate=16 May 2015|date=January 2007|publisher=Universal-Publishers|isbn=978-1-58112-933-5|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as covering current events and news from the scientific community, the magazine often features speculative articles, ranging from the technical to the philosophical. It is not a peer-reviewed scientific journal, but it is read by both [[scientists]] and non-scientists, as a way of keeping track of developments outside their own fields of study or areas of interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2091">'''David Quinn''' (born 1959) is a British bird artist. He won the 1987 Bird Illustrator of the Year Award of the ''[[British Birds (magazine)|British Birds]]'' magazine. His illustrations have appeared in several works, including the ''New World Warblers'' and ''Tits, Nuthatchs &amp; Treecreepers'' volumes of the [[Helm Identification Guides]] series, as well as accompanying identification papers in ''British Birds'' magazine.

David Quinn is based in [[Cheshire]], where he moved to in 1983.

He attended [[Buile Hill High School|Salford Grammar School]], then [[Manchester Metropolitan University|Manchester Polytechnic]], where he graduated with a BA with first class honours in [[graphic design]] in 1982.

Amongst other publications in which his illustrations are featured is the third edition of the ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] Field Guide to the Birds of North America'', as well as the ''Helm Identification Guide to New World Warblers''. He has also worked with [[Rob Hume]] on a guide to European [[gull]]s, yet to be published.

Quinn has found a number of rare [[Vagrancy in birds|vagrant]] birds in Cheshire, including a [[Franklin's gull]] at [[Neumann's Flash]] in 1987 and a first-winter [[American herring gull]] in 1994, the first accepted record for mainland Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, David (2009) American Herring Gull in Cheshire &amp; Wirral: new to Britain ''[[British Birds (magazine)|British Birds]]'' 102(6):342-7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digger gold''' is the common slang term {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} for [[gold]] recovered from electronics components such as board fingers, [[CPU]]s, and connector pins.

== Methods ==

For the gold fingers on boards or [[Electronic circuit|circuits]], often a stripping solution is used to remove the gold from the board material; [[nitric acid]] also works well in this regard as many gold components are soldered to boards with silver-based solders that are soluble in nitric acid (which gold is not). After dissolving all other metals in solution, the digger gold is recovered by dissolution of the gold in [[aqua regia]] and subsequent selective [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of the gold using [[ferrous sulfate]] or another selective [[reducing agent]] such as [[hydrazine]].

In [[science]], [[engineering]], and [[research]], '''expert elicitation''' is the synthesis of opinions of [[Experts|authorities]] of a subject where there is uncertainty due to insufficient [[data]] or when such data is unattainable because of physical constraints or lack of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=van der Sluijs, et. al.|first1=Jeroen P.|title=Expert Elicitation: Methodological suggestions for its use in environmental health impact assessments|url=http://www.nusap.net/downloads/reports/Expert_Elicitation.pdf|website=NUSAP|accessdate=25 November 2015|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expert elicitation is essentially a [[scientific consensus]] [[methodology]]. It is often used in the study of rare events. Expert elicitation allows for [[parametrization]], an "educated guess", for the respective topic under study. Expert elicitation generally [[Quantification (science)|quantifies]] [[uncertainty]].

Expert elicitation tends to be [[multidisciplinary]] as well as [[interdisciplinary]], with practically universal applicability, and is used in a broad range of fields. Prominent recent expert elicitation applications include [[climate change]], [[Scientific modelling|modeling]] [[seismic hazard]] and damage, association of [[tornado intensity and damage|tornado damage]] to [[wind speed]] in developing the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]], [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]] for [[nuclear waste]] storage.

In performing expert elicitation certain factors need to be taken into consideration. The topic must be one for which there are people who have predictive expertise. Furthermore, the objective should be to obtain an experts' carefully considered judgment based on a systematic consideration of all relevant evidence. For this reason one should take care to adopt strategies designed to help the expert being interviewed to avoid overlooking relevant evidence. Additionally, vocabulary used should face intense scrutiny; qualitative uncertainty words such as "likely" and "unlikely" are not sufficient and can lead to confusion. Such words can mean very different things to different people, or to the same people in different situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tversky|first1=Amos|last2=Kahneman|first2=Daniel|title=Judgments under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases|date=27 September 1974|publisher=Science|pages=1124–1131|edition=Vol. 185, No. 4157|url=http://psiexp.ss.uci.edu/research/teaching/Tversky_Kahneman_1974.pdf|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative''' (EITI) is a global standard for the good governance of oil, gas and mineral resources. It seeks to address the key governance issues in the extractive sectors.

The EITI Standard requires information along the extractive industry value chain from the point of extraction, to how the revenue makes its way through the government, to how it contributes to the economy.

This includes how licenses and contracts are allocated and registered, who are the beneficial owners of those operations are, what are the fiscal and legal arrangements are, how much is produced, how much is paid, where are those revenues allocated, and what is the contribution to the economy, including employment.

The [[Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative#The EITI Standard|EITI Standard]] is implemented in 52 countries around the world. Each of these countries is required publish to an annual EITI Report to disclose information on: contracts and licenses, production, revenue collection, revenue allocation, and social and economic spending.

Every country goes through a quality-assurance mechanism, called Validation, at least every three years. Validation serves to assess performance towards meeting the EITI Standard and promote dialogue and learning at the country level. It also safeguards the integrity of the EITI by holding all EITI implementing countries to the same global standard.

Each implementing country has its own national secretariat and multi-stakeholder group, made up of representatives from the country’s government, extractive companies and civil society. The multi-stakeholder group takes decisions on how the EITI process is carried out in the country.

The EITI Standard is developed and overseen by an international [[Multistakeholder governance model|multi-stakeholder]] Board, consisting of representatives from governments, extractives companies, civil society organisations, financial institutions and international organisations.

The Chair of the EITI is [[Fredrik Reinfeldt]], former [[Prime Minister of Sweden]]. The previous chairs have been the [[Clare Short]] (2011-2016), former [[Secretary of State for International Development|UK Secretary of State for International Development]] and [[Peter Eigen]] (2009-2011). The EITI International Secretariat is located in [[Oslo, Norway]] and is headed by former Swedish diplomat Jonas Moberg.

== History ==
The “Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative” (EITI) was first launched in September 2002 by [[Tony Blair|UK Prime Minister Tony Blair]] at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130715054456/http://www.johannesburgsummit.org/html/basic_info/basicinfo.html World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of Principles and Agreed Actions, EITI|url=http:/www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/eitidraftreportstatement.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090422161958/http:/www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/eitidraftreportstatement.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 April 2009|website=UK Web Archive|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; following years of academic debate, as well as lobbying from civil society and companies, on the management of government revenues from the extractive industries. In particular, the EITI was established to be an answer to public discussions on the “[[Resource Curse]]” or the “[[Paradox of Plenty]]”. NGOs such as by [[Global Witness]] and “[[Publish What You Pay]]”, as well as companies such as [[BP]] pushed the UK government to working towards an international transparency norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of EITI|url=http://eiti.org/eiti/history|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation was founded at a conference in [[London]] in 2003. The 140 delegates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final attendee list, Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) London  Conference 17 June 2003|url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/eitidraftreportattendance.pdf|publisher=DFID, UK|accessdate=1 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070701080507/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/eitidraftreportattendance.pdf|archivedate=1 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from government, companies and civil society agreed on twelve principles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of Principles and Agreed Actions, EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVE (EITI)  London Conference, 17 June 2003|url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/eitidraftreportstatement.pdf |publisher=DFID, UK |accessdate=1 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070701080507/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/eitidraftreportstatement.pdf|archivedate=1 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to increase transparency over payments and revenues in the extractive sector. A pilot phase of the EITI was launched in Nigeria, Azerbaijan, Ghana and the Kyrgyz Republic. The management of the Initiative continued to lay with the UK [[Department for International Development]].

The second EITI Conference on 17 March 2005 in London established six [https://web.archive.org/web/20140719154306/http://eiti.org/eiti/criteria criteria] based on the principles. These set out the minimum requirements for transparency in the management of resources in the oil, gas and mining sectors, laying the foundation for a rule-based organisation. This conference also established an international advisory group (IAG) under the Chairmanship of [[Peter Eigen]] to further guide the work of how the EITI is to be set up and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the EITI|url=http://eiti.org/eiti/history|website=www.eiti.org|publisher=EITI|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More countries, companies and civil-society organisations joined the initiative. The [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] endorsed the EITI.

The report issued in June 2006 by the international advisory group recommended the establishment of a multi-stakeholder board and an independent secretariat, and these were set in place at the third EITI conference held in Oslo, Norway on 11 October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The EITI Oslo Conference: Making transparency a global norm|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/archive/Stoltenbergs-2nd-Government/Ministry-of-Foreign-Affairs/Veiledninger-og-brosjyrer/2006/eiti_conference.html?regj_oss=1&amp;id=419568|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oslo was chosen as the new location for the secretariat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norway to host EITI international secretariat|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/archive/Stoltenbergs-2nd-Government/Ministry-of-Foreign-Affairs/Nyheter-og-pressemeldinger/pressemeldinger/2006/norway-to-host-eiti-international-secret.html?regj_oss=1&amp;id=439120|website=regjeringen.no/en/archive.html?id=115322|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years the body further fleshed out the criteria, turning them into a set of 23 requirements, known as the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130510191309/http://eiti.org/news-events/2011-edition-eiti-rules EITI Rules in 2011].

The EITI Standard replaced the EITI Rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawson|first1=Stella|title=EITI board raises bar on global standards to report natural resource revenues|url=http://www.trust.org/item/?map=eiti-board-raises-bar-on-global-standards-to-report-natural-resource-revenues|accessdate=1 September 2014|agency=Thompson Reuters Foundation|date=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 24 May 2013. The Standard was revised in February 2016.

== Structure and Funding  ==
The EITI is organised as a non-profit association under Norwegian law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EITI Articles of Association|url=http://eiti.org/document/eiti-articles-association}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has three institutional bodies: The Members’ Meeting, the EITI Board, and the International Secretariat. The Members’ Meeting governs the EITI and convenes alongside the EITI global conferences, which are held every two to three years.

The board develops the Standard and assesses the progress of the countries. It is supported by the international secretariat, located in Oslo, Norway.
[[File:EITI Global Conference 2016.jpg|thumb|303x303px|EITI Global Conference, February 2016]]
The EITI Board meets between two and four times a year and is composed of three groups: countries, companies and civil society. The membership of the Board reflects the multi-stakeholder nature of the EITI. The EITI Board has eight committees (audit, finance, governance and oversight, implementation, nominations, outreach and candidature, rapid response and Validation) to develop recommendations to the full board.

The funding of the EITI is two-fold. At the country level, implementation is funded by the governments. At the international level, the EITI is funded by implementing countries, supporting governments and companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EITI - How we are funded|url=http://eiti.org/about/funding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Member countries ==
Any country with [[Extractive industry|extractive industry sectors]] can adhere to the EITI Standard. Countries implementing the transparency standard include OECD states such as Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States as well as countries in Africa, Central and East Asia, Europe, and Latin America and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eiti.org/countries|title=EITI Countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a country intends to join the [[Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative#The EITI Standard|EITI Standard]], it is required to undertake five sign-up steps before applying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eiti.org/eiti/faq-countries-considering-eiti|title=FAQs for governments considering EITI implementation|website=eiti.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These steps relate to a clear commitment of the government, company and civil society engagement, the establishment of a multi-stakeholder group and agreement on a work plan, which sets out what the country wants to achieve within a certain time frame.

Once the application of the country has been accepted by the board, the country is called an “EITI candidate”. The candidate receives the deadlines for publishing information and undergoes “Validation” two and a half years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eiti.org/validation#validation-consequences|title=Validation consequences|last=EITI International Secretariat|first=|date=17 July 2017|website=eiti.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of Validation is a measure of how well the country is progressing to meet the requirements of the standard. It can make satisfactory, meaningful, inadequate or no progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eiti.org/about/how-we-work#upholding-the-standard-internationally-validation|title=Upholding the Standard internationally: Validation|last=EITI International Secretariat|first=|date=17 July 2017|website=eiti.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EITI board will ask the country to improve aspects which Validation deemed insufficient to fulfil the standard. An overview of Validation results is available [https://eiti.org/document/validation-schedule-decisions online].

When a candidate country passes EITI Validation, it is declared “EITI compliant” by the Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eiti.org/validation|title=EITI Validation|website=eiti.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2017, 51 countries are implementing the EITI:

Other countries, such as Lebanon, France and Australia have shown interest in implementing the EITI.&lt;ref&gt;http://eiti.org/countries/other&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of the EITI ==
The EITI has made significant contributions to improved governance of the extractive sector in several countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outcomes and impact of the EITI|url=https://eiti.org/outcomes-impact-of-eiti|website=eiti.org|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the EITI has been central to many reforms of the sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eiti.org/progress-report-2017/analysing-impact|title=EITI Progress Report 2017 - analysing impact|last=EITI International Secretariat|first=|date=17 July 2017|website=eiti.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the international level, debates on transparency in the sector are unrecognisable from ten years ago, and the EITI is seen as being at the forefront of many frontier debates including beneficial ownership, commodity trading, and artisanal and small-scale mining.

It is also clear that the EITI process is one of the only ''functioning'' global mechanisms to inform and channel debate in resource-rich countries in a way that includes all stakeholders. In Peru, EITI Reports have highlighted that, only about 15% of revenues from the mining and hydrocarbon sector has been used for developmental spending, such as infrastructure or economic diversification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://progrep.eiti.org/2016/country-focus/peru|title=EITI Progress Report 2016|last=EITI International Secretariat|first=|date=29 April 2016|website=eiti.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest has been spent on current expenditures such as salaries and servicing debts. Local citizens are using this information to engage with their regional authorities on alternative ways to spend these resources.

EITI Reports make recommendations aimed at addressing weaknesses in government systems and improving extractive sector management. In Nigeria, President Buhari has initiated major reforms in the oil sector, starting with restructuring the national oil company, a review of oil contracts, an pause in the awarding of the notorious oil swap deals, and a review of subsidy arrangements. These were all recommendations from Nigeria EITI Reports.

Furthermore, the EITI can lead to higher attractiveness for investments. There is “mounting evidence that information release supports greater competition around government contracting and that being an EITI signatory leads to greater inflows of both aid and foreign direct investment”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2017/02/big-signing|title=A big signing: Donald Trump signs a law repealing a disclosure rule for oil companies|last=The Economist|first=|date=17 February 2017|website=economist.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malden|first=Alexander|date=26 January 2017|title=A safer bet?

== Supporting Companies ==
Around 80 companies involved in oil, gas, and mining support the EITI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stakeholders|url=http://eiti.org/supporters/companies|website=eiti.org|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting companies publicly endorse the EITI and  contribute to covering the cost of the international secretariat of the EITI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eiti.org/funding#contributions-from-implementing-countries-and-companies|title=EITI funding - contributions from implementing countries and companies|last=EITI International Secretariat|first=|date=17 July 2016|website=eiti.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extractive companies are involved on the national level in countries implementing the transparency standard. They are part of the stakeholders and are required to hand over numbers on payments as part of the reporting process under the EITI standard. Company advocacy has resulted in several countries beginning EITI implementation.

== Criticism ==
Campaigning organisations have criticised the organisation for the lack of sanction possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Extracting oil, burying data|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21548214|accessdate=3 September 2014|agency=The Economist|issue=Feb 25th, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, business representatives have commented that the EITI board is captured by civil society organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comment - Beyond transparency: EITI stretches 'civil society' role|url=http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/vol-110/issue-4/general-interest/comment-beyond-transparency.html|publisher=Oil &amp; Gas Journal|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EITI has been seen as insufficient to bring full transparency to payments in the extractive industries, since it does not cover countries active in commodity trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rohstoffhandel blüht gleiches Schicksal wie den Banken|url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wirtschaft/unternehmen-und-konjunktur/Rohstoffhandel-blueht-gleiches-Schicksal-wie-den-Banken/story/23012824|accessdate=3 September 2014|agency=Tagesanzeiger online|date=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has since been addressed by new requirements of the EITI standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eiti.org/GN26|title=Guidance note 26 - Reporting on first trades in oil|last=EITI International Secretariat|first=|date=June 2017|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body's credibility was questioned after it permitted an Ethiopian application for membership in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last = Biron |first = Carey L. |date = 21 March 2014 |title = In Accepting Ethiopia, Transparency Group 'Sacrifices Credibility' |url = http://www.ipsnews.net/2014/03/accepting-ethiopia-transparency-group-sacrifices-credibility/ |agency = [[Inter Press Service]] |accessdate = 21 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EITI has also been criticised for ignoring the violations of [[human rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extractive Industries: A New Accountability Agenda|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/05/21/extractive-industries-new-accountability-agenda|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Azerbaijan]], and for not reacting sufficiently strongly to the harassment of Azerbaijani civil society groups that are part of EITI's multi-stakeholder approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan: Transparency Group Should Suspend Membership|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/08/14/azerbaijan-transparency-group-should-suspend-membership|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=25 August 2014|date=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the EITI has been criticised by an international lending institution for shifting its mandate beyond the promition of transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-04/ebrd-pushes-on-with-azerbaijan-gas-loan-after-transparency-rift|title=EBRD Pushes on With Azerbaijan Gas Loan After Transparency Rift|last=Bloomberg|first=|date=4 May 2017|work=Bloomberg Markets|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Food science''' is the [[applied science]] devoted to the study of [[food]]. The [[Institute of Food Technologists]] defines food science as "the discipline in which the engineering, biological, and physical sciences are used to study the nature of foods, the causes of deterioration, the principles underlying [[food processing]], and the improvement of foods for the consuming public".&lt;ref&gt;Heldman, Dennis R. "IFT and the Food Science Profession." ''Food Technology.'' October 2006. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The textbook ''Food Science'' defines food science in simpler terms as "the application of basic sciences and engineering to study the physical, chemical, and biochemical nature of foods and the principles of food processing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Food Science| series = Food science texts series|edition =5th| first1 = Norman N. |last1 = Potter| first2= Joseph H.| last2= Hotchkiss| publisher= Springer| year =1998| isbn= 9780834212657| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ERoAm13YF8IC&amp;dq=Food+science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities of food scientists include the development of new food products, design of processes to produce these foods, choice of packaging materials, [[shelf-life]] studies, sensory evaluation of products using [[survey panel]]s or potential consumers, as well as microbiological and chemical testing.&lt;ref name="ift.org Food Science Activity Guides"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ift.org/knowledge-center/learn-about-food-science/k12-outreach/activity-guides.aspx | title=Food Science Activity Guides | accessdate=February 2, 2015 | website=IFT.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food scientists may study more fundamental phenomena that are directly linked to the production of food products and its properties.

Food science brings together multiple scientific disciplines. It incorporates concepts from fields such as [[microbiology]], [[chemical engineering]], and [[biochemistry]].

==Disciplines==
Some of the subdisciplines of food science are described below.

===Food chemistry===
{{main article|Food chemistry}}
Food chemistry is the study of [[chemical]] processes and interactions of all biological and non-biological components of foods.&lt;ref&gt;John M. de Man.1999. ''Principles of Food Chemistry'' (Food Science Text Series), Springer Science, Third Edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John M. de Man. 2009. Food process engineering and technology, Academic Press, Elsevier: London and New York, 1st edn.&lt;/ref&gt; The biological substances include such items as [[meat]], [[poultry]], [[lettuce]], [[beer]], and [[milk]] as examples.
It is similar to [[biochemistry]] in its main components such as [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, and [[protein]], but it also includes areas such as water, [[vitamin]]s, [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], [[enzyme]]s, [[food additive]]s, [[flavor]]s, and [[Food coloring|colors]]. This discipline also encompasses how products change under certain [[food processing]] techniques and ways either to enhance or to prevent them from happening.

====Food physical chemistry====
{{main article|Food physical chemistry}}
Food physical chemistry is the study of both physical and chemical interactions in foods in terms of physical and chemical principles applied to food systems, as well as the application of physicochemical techniques and instrumentation for the study and analysis of foods.

===Food engineering===
{{main article|Food engineering}}
[[File:Factory Automation Robotics Palettizing Bread.jpg|thumb|A pizza factory in Germany, an example of [[food engineering]]]]
Food engineering is the industrial processes used to [[Food manufacture|manufacture food]].

===Food microbiology===
[[File:LUA, Faculty of Food Technology Food microbiology laboratory.jpg|thumbnail|[[Food microbiology]] laboratory at the [[Faculty of Food Technology, Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies|Faculty of Food Technology]], [[Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies]].]]
{{main article|Food microbiology}}
Food microbiology is the study of the [[microorganism]]s that inhabit, create, or [[Food contaminant|contaminate]] [[food]], including the study of microorganisms causing food spoilage.&lt;ref name=FratamicoBayles&gt;{{cite book | author = Fratamico PM and Bayles DO (editor). | title = Foodborne Pathogens: Microbiology and Molecular Biology | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2005 |  isbn = 978-1-904455-00-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Good" bacteria, however, such as [[probiotics]], are becoming increasingly important in food science.&lt;ref name=Tannockpro3&gt;{{cite book | author = Tannock GW (editor). | title = Probiotics and Prebiotics: Scientific Aspects | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2005 | isbn =  978-1-904455-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= LjunghWadstrom&gt;{{cite book |author= Ljungh A, Wadstrom T (editors)| year=2009 |title=Lactobacillus Molecular Biology: From Genomics to Probiotics | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-41-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= MayoB&gt;{{cite book |author= Mayo, B; van Sinderen, D (editor)| year=2010 |title=Bifidobacteria: Genomics and Molecular Aspects | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-904455-68-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, microorganisms are essential for the production of foods such as [[cheese]], [[yogurt]], [[bread]], [[beer]], [[wine]] and, other [[Fermentation in food processing|fermented foods]].

===Food packaging===
[[File:FoodScience-ex2.png|thumbnail|[[Food packaging]] in progress]]

===Food preservation===
{{main article|Food preservation}}
Food preservation involves the causes and prevention of quality spoilage

===Food substitution===
Food substitution refers to the replacement of fat, sugar, or calories from a product while maintaining similar shape, texture, color, or taste.

===Food technology===
{{main article|Food technology}}
Food technology is the technological aspects.
Early scientific research into food technology concentrated on food preservation. Nicolas Appert’s development in 1810 of the canning process was a decisive event.  The process wasn’t called canning then and Appert did not really know the principle on which his process worked, but canning has had a major impact on food preservation techniques.

===Molecular gastronomy===
{{main article|Molecular gastronomy}}
Molecular gastronomy is the scientific investigation of processes in cooking, social and artistic [[gastronomic]]al phenomena.
Molecular gastronomy is a subdiscipline of food science that seeks to investigate the physical and chemical transformations of ingredients that occur in cooking. Its program includes three axis, as cooking was recognized to have three components, which are social, artistic and technical.

===New product development===
{{main article|New product development}}
New product development includes the invention of new food products.

===Quality control===
{{main article|Quality control}}
[[File:FoodScience-ex3.png|thumbnail|A technician performing [[quality control]]]]

Quality control involves the causes, prevention and communication dealing with [[food-borne illness]]. 

Quality control also ensures that product meets specs to ensure the customer receives what they expect from the packaging to the physical properties of the product itself.

===Sensory analysis===
{{main article|Sensory analysis}}
Sensory analysis is the study of how consumers' senses perceive food.

==By country==

===Australia===
{{main|Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation}}
The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is the federal government agency for scientific research in [[Australia]]. CSIRO maintains more than 50 sites across Australia and biological control research stations in France and Mexico. It has nearly 6,500 employees.

===South Korea===
The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology, or KoSFoST, claims to be the first society in South Korea for food science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kosfost.or.kr/eng/|title=Korean Society of Food Science and Technology (KoSFoST)|publisher=KoSFoST |accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=February 2015}}

===United States===
In the United States, food science is typically studied at [[land-grant universities]]. Many of the country's pioneering food scientists were women who had attended chemistry programs at land-grant universities (which were state-run and largely under state mandates to allow for sex-blind admission), but then graduated and had difficulty finding jobs due to widespread sexism in the chemistry industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Finding conventional career paths blocked, they found alternative employment as instructors in [[home economics]] departments and used that as a base to launch the foundation of many modern food science programs.

The main US organization regarding food science and [[food technology]] is the [[Institute of Food Technologists]] (IFT), headquartered in [[Chicago, Illinois]], which is the US member organisation of the [[International Union of Food Science and Technology]] (IUFoST).

'''Frederick Talbot''' (born 17 December 1949) is a British former television presenter. He spent much of his career in [[North West England]]. In February 2015, and again in May 2017, he was found guilty of a string of indecent sexual assaults against teenage boys whilst he was employed as a teacher at [[Altrincham Grammar School for Boys]] before he moved into television presenting.&lt;ref name=BBC31456840/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardConvict/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telg11405385/&gt; He was sentenced to five years in prison following his initial convictions. He was sentenced to a further four years in June 2017 following conviction for further indecent assaults committed in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-40288601|title=Fred Talbot jailed for four years for sex offences on school trips to Scotland|work=BBC News|date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life and teaching==
Born in [[Edinburgh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-31456840|title=Fred Talbot: Weatherman guilty of abusing teenage boys|work=BBC News|date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talbot received his early formal education at [[North Cestrian Grammar School]], and in 1964 was a founding member of the Altrincham and District Astronomical Society, with which he co-discovered a [[meteor shower]], the [[List of meteor showers|June Lyrids]] in June 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meteorshowersonline.com/showers/june_lyrids.html Article on the June Lyrids from meteroshowersonline.com]. Meteorshowersonline.com (15 June 1966). Retrieved on 27 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

After teacher training in [[Gateshead]] in the late 1960s,&lt;ref name=GuardConvict/&gt; he was employed to teach [[biology]] at [[Altrincham Grammar School for Boys]]&lt;ref name="mmu"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.mmu.ac.uk/news/articles/673/ |title=Fred's big day&amp;nbsp;– Green Guide presenter honoured |publisher=Manchester Metropolitan University |date=23 July 2007 |accessdate=21 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213150139/http://www.mmu.ac.uk/news/articles/673/ |archivedate=13 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; until May 1984, when his schooling career came to "an abrupt end" following an indecent proposal he made to two pupils at his home.&lt;ref name=BBC31456840/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardConvict/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telg11405385/&gt;

==Media career==
[[File:Albert Dock, Liverpool - geograph.org.uk - 671553.jpg|thumb|right|The 'weather map' at Liverpool Docks that Talbot used as weather presenter on ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]'']]
At the time of his dismissal, Talbot was also recording a weekly astronomy programme for radio.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In 1984, he began presenting for the regional news programme ''[[Granada Reports]]'' in [[North West England]].&lt;ref name="ITV"&gt;[http://www.itv.com/granada/meettheteam/ Meet the Team] ITV Granada Reports &lt;!-- perhaps an earlier version of this page is intended, e.g. from archive.org? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Granada Television]] later commissioned Talbot to appear in a general educational science programme for children called ''The Final Frontier''. He continued as a regular reporter for ''Granada Reports'' and became a weatherman for the ITV's ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]'' in October 1988.&lt;ref name="ITV"/&gt;

Until production of ''This Morning'' was moved from the [[Albert Dock]], Liverpool, to London, Talbot presented weather reports from a large floating map of the [[British Isles]] in the dock. He was required to jump across a gap to go back and forth between Ireland and [[Great Britain|Britain]]; crowds often gathered to watch his leap. On one occasion, a diver swam near the map to distract Talbot and on another a [[Streaking|streaker]] swam naked up to the map and jumped on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV streaker Mark Roberts makes nude protest over Sir Fred Goodwin...|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/editors-choice/2009/04/07/tv-streaker-mark-roberts-makes-nude-protest-over-sir-fred-goodwin-but-ends-up-in-wrong-bank-86908-21259952/|date=7 April 2009|publisher=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talbot also presented several regional feature series for [[ITV Granada]], including ''Locks and Quays''&lt;ref name="bfi"&gt;{{cite web

He also contributed to the [[CITV]] science series ''[[Prove It!]]'' and guest presented weather forecasts for the [[ITV Breakfast]] programme ''[[Daybreak (2010 TV programme)|Daybreak]]''.

==Indecent assault convictions==
In December 2012, Greater Manchester Police carried out a search of Talbot's home in [[Bowdon, Greater Manchester|Bowdon]], when allegations first emerged of abuse at Altrincham Grammar School between the early 1970s and early 1980s. A day before the search, Talbot posted on his [[Twitter]] account that he was on a holiday cruise in the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-20807922|title=TV weatherman Fred Talbot's home raided in abuse probe|work=BBC News|date=21 December 2012|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not return to his role at ITV Granada upon his return to the UK, but was not suspended.

== Biography ==
Winterberg was born in 1929 in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. In 1953 he received his MSc from the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]] working under [[Friedrich Hund]], and in 1955 he received his PhD in physics from the [[Max Planck Institute]], [[Göttingen]], as a student of [[Werner Heisenberg]].   In 1959, Winterberg was brought to the United States as part of [[Operation Paperclip]].&lt;ref name=Hunt&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunt|first=Linda|authorlink=|title=''Secret Agenda: The United States Government, Nazi Scientists, and Project Paperclip, 1945 to 1990''|year=1991|publisher=St.Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-05510-2|pages=6,21,31,176,204,259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=B7RV_vASz0EC&amp;pg=PR7&lt;/ref&gt; Friedwardt was 15 at the end of the war. Paperclip continued to recruit German scientists through the [[Cold War]] to prevent them from working for the Soviets.
==Work==
Winterberg is known for his work in the fields of [[nuclear fusion]] and [[plasma physics]], and [[Edward Teller]] has been quoted as saying that he had "perhaps not received the attention he deserves" for his work on fusion.&lt;ref name="king 171"&gt;{{harvnb|King|1989|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an elected member of the Paris-based [[International Academy of Astronautics]], in which he sat on the Committee of Interstellar Space Exploration.&lt;ref name="regents minutes"&gt;Cited in the University of Nevada System Board of Regents' Meeting Minutes, April 12–13, 1990.

Winterberg, "Rocket propulsion by thermonuclear microbombs ignited with intense relativistic electron beams", Raumfahrtforschung 15, 208-217 (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matloff|2005|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted by the [[British Interplanetary Society]] for their [[Project Daedalus]] Starship Study.&lt;ref name="faculty bio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Bond and Anthony R. Martin, [[Project Daedalus]] - Final Report, Journal of The British Interplanetary Society, pp. S1-S192, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; His current research is on the "Planck Aether Hypothesis", "a novel theory that explains both [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[theory of relativity]] as [[asymptote|asymptotic]] low energy approximations, and gives a spectrum of particles greatly resembling the [[standard model]]. [[Einstein field equations|Einstein's gravitational]] and [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's electromagnetic equations]] are unified by the symmetric and antisymmetric wave mode of a vortex sponge, [[Dirac spinor]]s result from gravitationally interacting bound positive-negative mass vortices, which explains why the mass of an electron is so much smaller than the [[Planck mass]]. The phenomenon of charge is for the first time explained to result from the zero point oscillations of Planck mass particles bound in vortex filaments."&lt;ref&gt;Winterberg (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The theory proposes that the only free parameters in the fundamental equations of physics are the [[Planck length]], [[Planck mass|mass]], and [[Planck time|time]], and shows why [[Euclidean space|R3]] is the natural space, as [[Special unitary group|SU2]] is treated as the fundamental [[Group (mathematics)|group]] [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to [[Special unitary group|SO3]] &amp;mdash; an alternative to [[string field theory|string field theories]] in R10 and [[M theory]] in R11. It permits the value of the [[Fine-structure constant|finestructure constant]] at the Planck length to be computed, and this value remarkably agrees with the empirical value. He has published extensively on many aspects of physics from the 1950s through the present. In 2008, Winterberg criticized string theory and pointed out the shortcomings of Einstein's general theory of relativity because of its inability to be reconciled with quantum mechanics at  the [[Physical Interpretations of Relativity Theory]] conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physicsfoundations.org/PIRT_XI/texts.html|title=The Einstein Myth &amp; the Crisis in Modern Physics|author=F.

== Proposal for direct test of general relativity ==
In a 1955 paper Winterberg proposed a test of [[general relativity]] using accurate atomic clocks placed in orbit in artificial satellites.&lt;ref&gt;Winterberg, Relativistische Zeitdilatation eines künstlichen Satelliten, Astronautica Acta, Vol. 2, no. 1, pp. 25-29 1956&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bourabai.kz/winter/satelliten.htm Bourabai.kz]&lt;/ref&gt;  At that time atomic clocks were not yet of the required accuracy and artificial satellites did not exist. [[Werner Heisenberg]] wrote a letter to Winterberg in 1957 in which he said the idea sounded "very interesting".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winterberg|2002|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bourabai.narod.ru/winter/img/heizen-letter.gif | format = GIF | title = Letter from Werner Heisenberg | publisher = Narod.ru }}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was later experimentally verified by [[Hafele–Keating experiment|Hafele and Keating]] in 1971 by flying atomic clocks on commercial jets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hafele | first1 = J.

Winterberg has published numerous articles in the area of [[inertial confinement fusion]]. In particular, Winterberg is known for the idea of impact fusion and the concept of the magnetically insulated diode for the generation of multi-megampere megavolt ion beams for the purpose of heating plasmas to thermonuclear fusion temperatures. He conceived of a nuclear fusion propulsion reactor for space travel, which is called the Winterberg / Daedalus Class&lt;ref&gt;M. W. Turner, C. W. Hawk, R. J. Litchford, Experiments in Magnetic Flux Compression using Plasma Armatures, 12th Annual NASA/JPL/MSFC Advanced Space Propulsion Workshop&lt;/ref&gt; Magnetic Compression Reaction Chamber, which was later developed at the University of Alabama at Huntsville's Propulsion Research Center.  Most recently he has designed a giant spacecraft, propelled with deuterium micro-detonations ignited by a GeV proton beam, drawn from the spacecraft acting as an electrically charged up and magnetically insulated capacitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=0812.0397 |title=Deuterium microbomb rocket propulsion |date=December 2, 2008| last1 = Winterberg | first1 = Friedwardt | authorlink = Friedwardt Winterberg |bibcode = 2008arXiv0812.0397W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Winterberg also developed ideas for mining increasingly rare industrially crucial elements on planetary bodies such as the moon using fusion detonation devices. He became involved with the idea of using beam weapons in outer space in the late 1970s while working at the [[Desert Research Institute]].

According to Dennis King, Winterberg shared his ideas on beam weapons with the U.S. Air Force and he speculated on the subject in publications for the [[Fusion Energy Foundation]] (FEF), a part of the [[Lyndon LaRouche]] [[LaRouche movement|movement]]. The FEF published a book of Winterberg describing the design [[Teller-Ulam design|of the hydrogen bomb]], with the hope of getting research in inertial confinement fusion declassified. Winterberg also contributed articles and interviews to the FEF magazine, ''Fusion'', and its successor magazine, ''[[21st Century Science and Technology]]''. He also participated in a 1985 conference jointly sponsored by the FEF and the [[Schiller Institute]], speaking on the topic of [[X-ray laser]]s, the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] and [[interstellar travel|interstellar travel]].&lt;ref name="colonize1985"&gt;Colonize Space, New Benjamin Franklin House, New York, N.Y. 1985&lt;/ref&gt;  The conference attracted a number of scientists interested in promoting fusion scientific research;&lt;ref name="colonize1985"/&gt; Winterberg was never a member of any of LaRouche's political organisations.

On November 12, 2007, Winterberg addressed the American Physical Society Plasma Physics Convention in Orlando, Florida, encouraging efforts to achieve economically feasible fusion energy, and presenting his ideas for what direction the efforts should take. Winterberg stresses inertial confinement fusion.

Back in 1963, it was proposed by Winterberg&lt;ref&gt;F. Winterberg, ''[[Z. Naturforsch. A]]'', '''19''', 231 (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; that the ignition of thermonuclear micro-explosions, could be achieved by an intense beam of [[macron (physics)|microparticles]] accelerated to a velocity of 1000&amp;nbsp;km/s. And in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;F. Winterberg, Phys. Rev. 174, 212 (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;  Winterberg proposed to use intense electron and ion beams, generated by Marx generators, for the same purpose. Most recently, Winterberg has proposed the ignition of a deuterium microexplosion, with a gigavolt super-Marx generator, which is a Marx Generator driven by up to 100 ordinary Marx generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | arxiv = 0812.0394 | last1 = Winterberg | first1 = Friedwardt | authorlink = Friedwardt Winterberg | title = Ignition of a deuterium micro-detonation with a gigavolt super marx generator | date = December 1, 2008 |bibcode = 2009JFuE...28..290W | doi=10.1007/s10894-008-9189-3 | volume=28 | journal=Journal of Fusion Energy | pages=290–295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rudolph controversy ==
In 1983, Winterberg became involved in disputes concerning the engineer [[Arthur Rudolph]], who had been brought to the United States after [[World War II]] as part of [[Operation Paperclip]] to work on the U.S. rocketry program.  It was Rudolph who then designed the [[Saturn V]] rocket that launched [[Neil Armstrong]] to the Moon. In the early 1980s, Rudolph's record as a potential [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[war criminal]] at [[Mittelwerk]] surfaced and became the center of a political controversy after the [[Office of Special Investigations (United States Department of Justice)|Office of Special Investigations]] (OSI) negotiated to have him renounce his U.S. citizenship, purportedly under duress,&lt;ref name="Franklin, 141"&gt;{{harvnb|Franklin|1987|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which he returned to Germany.  After a thorough investigation by German authorities, it was decided there was no basis for prosecution and his German citizenship was restored. Rudolph pursued lawsuits hoping to regain his US citizenship and was barred entry to the US in 1989.

Winterberg lobbied in favour of Rudolph,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lyndonlarouchewatch.org/fascism10.htm |title=Chapter 10, Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism |publisher=Lyndonlarouchewatch.org |date=1987-09-03 |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving interviews to magazines, launching his own separate investigation, and speaking in Rudolph's defense at a conference hosted by [[Lyndon LaRouche]].&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.philly.com/1986-03-07/news/26083229_1_mittelwerk-rudolph-case-arthur-rudolph&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Berlin wall legal assistant requests by the US Office of Special Investigation  to the Communist East German Government regarding the Rudolph case emerged and became part of the public record.

== Einstein–Hilbert dispute ==
{{main|Relativity priority dispute}}
Winterberg was also involved in a dispute relating to the [[history of general relativity]] in a controversy over the publication of the general relativity field equations (both [[Albert Einstein]] and [[David Hilbert]] had published them in a very short time span of one another). In 1997, Leo Corry, Jürgen Renn, and John Stachel published an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' entitled "Belated decision in the Hilbert-Einstein priority dispute", arguing that, after looking at the original proofs of the article by Hilbert, that they indicated that Hilbert had not anticipated Einstein's equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Corry|Renn|Stachel|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winterberg published a refutation of these conclusions in 2004, observing that the galley proofs of Hilbert's articles had been tampered with &amp;mdash; part of one page had been cut off. He argued that the removed part of the article contained the equations that Einstein later published and alleged that it was part of a "crude attempt by some unknown individual to falsify the historical record." He alleged that ''Science'' had refused to print the article and thus he was forced to publish it in ''[[Zeitschrift für Naturforschung]]''.  Winterberg's article argued that despite the missing part of the proofs, that the correct crucial Field Equation is still imbedded on other pages of the proofs, in various forms, including Hilbert's variational principle with correct Lagrangian from which the Field Equation is immediately derived.&lt;ref&gt;Winterberg (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Winterberg presented his findings at the American Physical Society meeting in Tampa, Florida in April 2005.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Corry, Renn, and Stachel authored a joint reply to Winterberg, which they claimed ''Zeitschrift für Naturforschung'' refused to publish without "unacceptable" modifications, and unable to find a publisher  elsewhere, they made it available on the internet. The reply accused Winterberg of misrepresenting the reason why ''Science'' would not publish his paper (it had to do with the section of the journal it was scheduled to appear in), and also misrepresenting that the paper published in ''Zeitschrift für Naturforschung'' was the same paper he had submitted to ''Science'', and had in fact been "substantially altered" after Winterberg had received their comments on an earlier draft. Actually, Winterberg in his Final Comment had clearly stated that the paper submitted to Science had been a ''previous version''.   They then argue that Winterberg's interpretation of the Hilbert paper was incorrect, that the lost part of the page was unlikely to have been consequential, and that much of Winterberg's reasoning about what could be in the missing piece was incorrect (down to noting  Winterberg claims that 1/3 of the page was removed, when actually over half a page is missing total from the two cut off pages) and internally inconsistent. They further argued there was a likely "non-paranoid" explanation for the missing part of the page.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Corry|Renn|Stachel|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But as it was pointed out by Todorov&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Todorov|first=Ivan|title=Einstein and Hilbert: The Creation of General Relativity|journal= |arxiv=physics/0504179|date=25 Apr 2005|bibcode=2005physics...4179T}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Logunov, Mestvirishvili, and Petrov,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Logunov|first=A.A.|author2=M.A.Mestvirishvili, V.A. Petrov|title=How were the Hilbert-Einstein Equations Discovered?|journal= |arxiv=physics/0405075|date=16 Jun 2004|bibcode=2004PhyU...47..607L|doi=10.1070/PU2004v047n06ABEH001817}}&lt;/ref&gt; even in his mutilated form, the page proofs of Hilbert contain the correct Lagrange density of the gravitational field, which in conjunction with Hilbert action results in the correct gravitational field equations. To derive the gravitational field equations from his action was not more than a minor exercise for Hilbert. Therefore, the game was over with Hilbert's action.

Later, the original reply to Winterberg was removed from their website and replaced with a much shorter statement saying only that Winterberg's conclusions were incorrect, specifically that he had focused on the missing page fragment, "a fact without any bearing on the matter at hand", while failing "to address the substantive difference between the theory expounded in the proofs" of Hilbert. The statement further said that Winterberg had apparently indicated that he was "personally offended" by the original response, the "Max Planck Institute for the History of Science has decided to replace the original, more detailed response to his paper with this abbreviated version".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Corry|Renn|Stachel|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was, apparently, because the original reply had contained two very derisive statements against Professor Winterberg; later, the Max Planck Society released a note distancing itself from those two statements, without commenting on the underlying scientific dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/texts/Winterberg-Antwort.html untitled note], Max Planck Society, 14 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Winterberg has written an article stating that Einstein's general theory of relativity cannot be reconciled with quantum theory in Einstein's attempt to reduce all of physics to geometry.&lt;ref name="doi:10.4006/1.3176669"/&gt;

'''Jearl Walker''' (born 1945 in [[Pensacola, Florida]]) is a [[physics|physicist]] noted for his book ''[[Flying Circus of Physics]]'', first published in 1975; the second edition was published in June 2006. He teaches physics at [[Cleveland State University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://facultyprofile.csuohio.edu/csufacultyprofile/detail.cfm?FacultyID=HRW Faculty profile, Cleveland State University]&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker has also revised and edited the textbook ''[[Fundamentals of physics (textbook)|Fundamentals of Physics]]'' with [[David Halliday (physics)|David Halliday]] and [[Robert Resnick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Walker |first1=Jearl |last2=Resnick |first2=Robert |authorlink2=Robert Resnick |last3=Halliday |first3=David |authorlink3=David Halliday (physicist) |title=Halliday &amp; Resnick Fundamentals of Physics |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=9781118233764 |oclc=436030602 |edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker is a well known popularizer of physics, and appeared ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (Professor Jearl Walker, Patrick Duffy)|url=https://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?p=42&amp;item=B:43854 |website=The Paley Center for Media |publisher=[[Paley Center for Media]] |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker is known  for his physics demonstrations, which have included sticking his hand in molten lead, walking barefoot over hot coals, lying on a bed of nails, and pouring freezing-cold [[liquid nitrogen]] in his mouth to demonstrate various principles of physics.  Such demonstrations are included in his [[PBS]] series, ''Kinetic Karnival'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kinetic Karnival|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/kinetic-karnival/407539/ |website=TV Guide |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced by [[WVIZ]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].

Walker authored  [[The Amateur Scientist]] column in ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazine from 1978 to 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scientific American's The Amateur Scientist Index |url=http://amasci.com/amateur/sciamdx.html |website=Science Hobbyist |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the latter part of this period, he had been the Chairman of the Physics Department at Cleveland State University. He appeared regularly around this time on the long-running CBC radio science program ''[[Quirks and Quarks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Suzuki |first1=David |authorlink1=David Suzuki |title=Letters to My Grandchildren |date=May 18, 2015 |publisher=Greystone Books |isbn=9781771640893 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSC5BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1981 to 1982 he hosted The Kinetic Karnival of Jearl Walker, a six-episode series for PBS syndication in the US. In each 30-minute program he performed humorous demonstrations before a live audience. The show was distributed to schools as a teaching aide.

He is the first recipient, in 2005, of the Outstanding Teaching Award from Cleveland State's College of Science. The College's Faculty Affairs Committee selected Walker as the first honoree based on his contributions to science education over the last 30 years.&lt;ref name=ClevelandStater&gt;{{cite news |last1=Antos |first1=Patrick |title='Flying Circus' lands Walker science award |url=http://www.csuohio.edu/class/com/clevelandstater/Archives/Vol%207/Issue%203/news/news4.html |accessdate=December 20, 2016 |work=The Cleveland Stater|date=July 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award was thereafter named "The Jearl Walker Outstanding Teaching Award" in his honor.&lt;ref name=ClevelandStater/&gt;

'''Josef Herzig''' (25 September 1853 – 4 July 1924) was an [[Austria]]n [[chemist]].  

Herzig was born in [[Sanok]], [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], which at that time was part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. Herzig went to school in [[Breslau]] until 1874, started studying chemistry at the [[University of Vienna]] but joined [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] at the [[University of Berlin]] in the second semester. He worked with [[Robert Bunsen]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]] and received his PhD for work with [[Ludwig Barth]] at the  [[University of Vienna]]. He later became lecturer and, in 1897, professor at the [[University of Vienna]]. He died in [[Vienna]] in 1924.

==Work==
Herzig was active in the chemistry of natural products. He succeeded in determining the structure of [[flavonoid]]s [[quercetin]],  [[fisetin]] and [[rhamnetin]] as well as several [[alkaloid]]s.

[[Commander (Royal Navy)|Commander]] '''Joseph Russell Stenhouse''', [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|DSC]], [[Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Reserve|RD]], [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNR]] (1887–1941) was a Scottish-born seaman, [[Royal Navy]] Officer and Antarctic navigator, who commanded the expedition vessel [[SY Aurora|SY ''Aurora'']] during her 283-day drift in the ice while on service with the [[Ross Sea Party]] component of [[Sir Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] 1914-17.  After ''Aurora''{{'}}s escape from the ice he brought her safely to [[New Zealand]], but was thereafter replaced as the vessel's commander.  He later served with distinction in the Royal Navy during both World Wars.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Dumbarton]], Scotland, into a prosperous shipbuilding family,&lt;ref&gt;The family firm was Birrell, Stenhouse &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; and was educated in England at [[Barrow-in-Furness|Barrow]] Grammar School.  After a short spell as a junior clerk with [[Lloyd's Register of Shipping]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.antarctica.org/AHT/CrewRossSeaParty|title=See Stenhouse entry in heritage.antarctica.org|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; he served a Merchant Officer's apprenticeship on tall ships rounding Cape Horn. He then joined the [[British India Steam Navigation Company]] before receiving a last-minute appointment as First Officer on the ''Aurora'', which was then in Australia awaiting refit. Receiving a commission as a [[sub-lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Naval Reserve]] on 1 August 1914,  Stenhouse sailed for Australia aboard SS ''Ionic'' on 18 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30186|page=7129|date=17 July 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Aurora==
===In McMurdo Sound===
''Aurora'', commanded by Captain [[Aeneas Mackintosh]], left [[Hobart]] for Antarctica on 24 December 1914 and arrived in [[McMurdo Sound]], with the [[Ross Sea Party]], on 14 January 1915.  The party's main mission was to lay depots across the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] for Shackleton's expected transcontinental party.  When Mackintosh left to take charge of depot-laying operations, Stenhouse took over command of the ship, with the task of finding a suitable winter anchorage.  He had two problems here; first, he was inexperienced in these waters; secondly he was handicapped by Shackleton's prior instruction to Mackintosh that the ship be anchored somewhere north of the [[Antarctica|Glacier Tongue]],&lt;ref&gt;Glacier Tongue was an ice promontory protruding out into McMurdo Sound about midway between Cape Evans to the north and [[Hut Point]] to the south&lt;/ref&gt; to reduce the risks of its being trapped in the frozen seas around [[Hut Point]] - the fate of [[Captain Scott]]'s [[RRS Discovery|RRS ''Discovery'']] in 1902-04. Since ''Discovery'', no ship had attempted to winter in the Sound - ''Nimrod'' and ''Terra Nova'' had returned to New Zealand - and the number of sheltered anchorages north of the tongue was very limited.  Stenhouse manoeuvred the ship for many weeks before deciding to anchor at [[Cape Evans]], site of Scott's Last Expedition headquarters, 1910-13.  On 14 March the ship was made fast and its engines were subsequently decommissioned for winter maintenance.

Despite great care being taken over the anchorage the winter storms around Cape Evans proved too much, and on the night of 6 May she was wrenched from her moorings and taken out to sea with the ice.  Aboard were 18 men, and most of the shore party's clothing, equipment and food. Ashore, stranded, were ten men, including Mackintosh.

===Adrift===
{{main|SY Aurora's drift}}
The situation which immediately confronted the inexperienced temporary commander was particularly daunting.  The ship, attached to a large ice-floe, was blown out of the Sound and into the [[Ross Sea]] with no means of control, unable to raise steam, and with weather conditions likely to worsen.  They were wholly isolated, despite the repeated efforts of wireless operator Lionel Hooke to make radio contact with Cape Evans and other, more distant stations.&lt;ref&gt;The ship-to-shore equipment was very primitive, but Hooke finally succeeded in raising New Zealand [[New Zealand|Bluff]], though only after ''Aurora'' was free from the ice&lt;/ref&gt;  During the succeeding perilous weeks, as the ice-bound ''Aurora'' drifted northwards, roughly parallel to the coast in the direction of [[Cape Adare]], Stenhouse twice came close towards ordering abandonment of the ship and risking a dangerous sledging journey on the ice.  The ship survived, however, and continued its drift into the Southern Ocean.  Throughout the drift, Stenhouse endeavoured to keep up his crew's morale, and for scientific purposes maintained regular observations of the behaviour of the ice and direction of drift.&lt;ref&gt;See log entry 22 September 1915, quoted in South, Ch.20&lt;/ref&gt;  By February 1916, without sign of release, Stenhouse contemplated the possibility of another year in the ice, but on 12th of that month the ice around her suddenly broke away and she was free.  Stenhouse ordered the engines started, and cautiously worked the ship out of the loose pack into the open sea.  After a 1000-mile voyage through rough seas to New Zealand, and with assistance in the final stages from a tug, he brought ''Aurora'' into [[Port Chalmers]] on 3 April 1916.

===In New Zealand===
His urgent priority after arrival was to get ''Aurora'' repaired and to take her back to McMurdo Sound to rescue the stranded men who had by then been marooned for almost a year.  He did not find his concerns recognised by immediate action on the part of the authorities.  There were questions of cash - Shackleton's expedition funds were exhausted, and the costs of refitting and provisioning a relief expedition were estimated at around £20,000.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler-Lewis, p225&lt;/ref&gt; Now Shackleton's apparently cavalier approach to the original organisation of the Ross Sea Party stood against him.  Eventually, the combined governments of New Zealand, Australia and Great Britain agreed jointly to meet the costs of the rescue provided that they exercised full control over the mission.  Stenhouse still considered that he was the ''Aurora'''s commander and assumed that he would lead the relief expedition when the ship was ready to sail, but the representatives of the governments decided that he was too inexperienced.&lt;ref&gt;They were influenced by the advice of Capt. John Davis King who would ultimately lead the relief. Tyler-Lewis, p225&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also Shackleton's man, and they were adamant that neither Shackleton, who had reappeared in the [[Falkland Islands]] after his own extended adventure and escape,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] and [[Sir Ernest Shackleton]]&lt;/ref&gt; nor his proxy, should  lead the relief, and appointed their own choice, Captain [[John King Davis]].  The politics of the situation were largely kept from Stenhouse, who was shocked to learn of King's appointment on 4 October, and initially refused to recognise its validity.&lt;ref&gt;He was offered the reversion to his original First Officer role, but rejected this and was then formally dismissed by King. Tyler-Lewis, p228&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when Shackleton, who had arrived in New Zealand on 12 December, grudgingly concurred with King's appointment, Stenhouse had no choice but to step down.  He then returned to England.

==War hero==
On his return to England Stenhouse reported for duty with the Royal Navy and was posted as Gunnery Officer to mystery [[Q-ship]] PQ61.&lt;ref&gt;PQ61's commander was Frank Worsley who had captained Shackleton's ship ''Endurance''&lt;/ref&gt;  On 26 September 1917 the ship engaged and sank a U-boat in the Irish sea, an action which earned Stenhouse a [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]] (DSC) on 17 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30386|supp=y|page=11921|date=16 November 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; After promotion to lieutenant and a spell in command of the [[schooner]] [[Royal Navy|HMS Ianthe]], he joined Shackleton on a mission to [[Murmansk]], to equip and train the [[North Russia Intervention|North Russian (anti-Bolshevik) army]]. This included, from May 1919, command of a flotilla of motor boats operating on [[Lake Onega]] to counter the threat of Bolshevik vessels.&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;Damien Wright. ''Shackleton's men in the Arctic: polar explorers and Arctic warfare in North Russia 1918-19''. Orders &amp; Medals Research Society Journal, September 2017, page 194.&lt;/ref&gt;. For this service he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London Gazette, 3 February 1920|url= https://www.thegazette.co.uk/Edinburgh/issue/13560/page/368|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was made an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London Gazette, 30 March 1920|url= https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/31840/supplement/3805|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war Life==
In 1923 Stenhouse married Gladys Mackintosh, Aeneas Mackintosh's widow, and in 1924 a daughter was born. He was promoted to lieutenant-commander in the RNR on 1 August 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32967|page=6352|date=22 August 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1927 and 1929 he captained the ''Discovery'' on oceanographic and whaling research voyages in Southern Atlantic and Antarctic waters.  Thereafter he attempted several business ventures which largely failed, as did an attempt to find treasure in the [[Cocos Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackintosh had sought this treasure in 1911, with similar lack of success&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1928, Stenhouse was awarded the [[Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Reserve]] (RD).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33380|page=3050|date=1 May 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from the RNR on 31 December 1931 with the rank of commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33791|page=420|date=19 January 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the outbreak of World War II, however, Stenhouse signed on for active service. Whilst in the Gulf of Aden in 1940, he risked his own life to save that of a crew member after his ship was struck by a mine.  On 12 September 1941 he was reported missing, presumed killed, when his ship exploded and sank in the Red Sea.

Joseph Stenhouse is commemorated by [[Antarctica|Stenhouse Bluff]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]] at {{coord|62|04|S|58|24|W|display=inline}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1814">'''József Szabó de Szentmiklós''' (March 14, 1822 &amp;ndash; April 12, 1894), [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[geologist]], was born at [[Kalocsa]].

His first contribution to science was an essay on [[metallurgy]], in which subject he had received special training. Afterwards he settled at [[Budapest]] and investigated the [[geology]] of the district, the results of which were published in a [[geological map]] (1858). In 1859 he joined the staff of the Austrian Geological Survey as a volunteer member, and paid attention to the economic as well as to the purely scientific aspects of the work. He also arranged for surveys having special reference to agricultural geology to be undertaken by the Hungarian Geological Institute. In 1862 he became professor of geology and [[mineralogy]] in the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]].

In later years he devoted himself largely to [[petrology]], and published memoirs on the [[trachyte]]s of Hungary and [[Transylvania]]; on a new method of determining the species of [[feldspar]]s in rocks, depending on fusibility and flame-coloration; on the geology and petrology of the district of [[Schemnitz]]; and on [[Santorini|Santorin Island]]. He died at Budapest on April 12, 1894.

He was author of ''Geologie mit besonderer Rüchsicht auf die Petrographie, den Vulkanismus u. die Hydrographie'' (1883).

'''Kate Devlin''', born '''Adela Katharine Devlin''' is a British computer scientist specialising in [[Artificial intelligence]] and [[Human–computer interaction]] (HCI). She is best known for her work on human sexuality and robotics and was co-chair of the annual Love and Sex With Robots convention in 2016 held in London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LSR 2017|url=http://loveandsexwithrobots.org|website=Love and Sex With Robots|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was founder of the UK's first ever sex tech [[hackathon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Tech Hack II – The Secong Coming|url=http://sexhack.tech|website=Hacksmiths|publisher=Goldsmiths Tech Society|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; held in 2016 at [[Goldsmiths, University of London]].&lt;ref name="reg2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fay|first1=Joe|title=Will AI lead to the rise of the love machines?|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/14/reg_love_robot_lecture/|website=The Register|publisher=Situation Publishing|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She is a senior lecturer in the department of computing at Goldsmiths, part of the University of London and is the author of ''Turned On: Science, Sex and Robots'' in addition to several academic papers.&lt;ref name=gold2017/&gt;

==Education==
Devlin began her university career in the [[humanities]] and graduated from [[Queen's University Belfast]] in 1997 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA (Honours)]] degree in [[archaeology]]. After deciding that archaeology presented her with limited future prospects, she returned to Queen's University to study computer science, and in 1999 she was awarded an [[Master of Science|MSc]] in that subject. She then moved to [[University of Bristol|The University of Bristol]], where in 2004 she was awarded a PhD in computer science.&lt;ref name="gold2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yt2017" /&gt;

==Academic career==

In 2003 Devlin began researching computer graphics in archaeology at Bristol University, rendering [[3D computer graphics|3D computer models]] of archaeological sites such as at [[Pompeii]] with attention to realistically rendering lighting effects caused by the [[Spectral color|spectral]] composition of light sources available at the time period in history. This involved [[experimental archaeology]], recreating light sources and analysing the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectral range]] for each type of candle or fuel lamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seeing the light|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2003/1113821398.html|publisher=University of Bristol|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007 Devlin has worked in the field of human-computer interaction and [[artificial intelligence]] at Goldsmiths,&lt;ref name="yt2017" /&gt; and is a senior lecturer in several areas of computer science, including [[Computer programming|programming]], [[Computer graphics|graphics]] and animation.&lt;ref name="gold2017" /&gt;

In 2015 Devlin spoke to news broadcasters in the UK about institutionalised sexism within science research and academia after [[Tim Hunt#Controversy at WCSJ|comments made by Sir Tim Hunt]] regarding women scientists working in mixed laboratories. While Devlin, along with many other commentators, acknowledged the comments to be [[Conversation#Banter|'banter']] she expressed the frustration that many women have with sexism in the fields of [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nobel scientist Tim Hunt criticised for chauvinist remarks|url=https://www.channel4.com/news/nobel-scientist-tim-hunt-criticised-for-chauvinist-remarks-royal-society|website=Channel Four News|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and jokingly [[Twitter#Tweets|tweeted]] that she couldn't chair a departmental meeting because she was "too busy swooning and crying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bilefsky|first1=Dan|title=Women Respond to Nobel Laureate's 'Trouble With Girls'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/world/europe/tim-hunt-nobel-laureate-resigns-sexist-women-female-scientists.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devlin also speaks publicly and writes to encourage more women to pursue technology careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in technology|url=http://2017.inspirewit.com/|website=Inspire|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tit2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devlin|first1=Kate|title=Titstare proves there are still too many dicks in tech|url=https://theconversation.com/titstare-proves-there-are-still-too-many-dicks-in-tech-18199|website=The Conversation|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Devlin co-chaired the ''International Congress on Love and Sex With Robots'' held in London, UK, an annual conference held since 2014, co-founded by [[Adrian David Cheok]] and [[David Levy (chess player)|David Levy]], writer of the book of the same name, [[Love and Sex with Robots]].&lt;ref name="Gua22017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wiseman|first1=Eva|title=Sex, love and robots: is this the end of intimacy?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/13/sex-love-and-robots-the-end-of-intimacy|website=The Guardian|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gua2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kleeman|first1=Jenny|title=The race to build the world's first sex robot|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/27/race-to-build-world-first-sex-robot|website=The Guardian|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in 2016, Devlin founded the first UK [[sex technology]] (sex tech) [[hackathon]], a conference where scientists, students, academics and other people in the sex tech industry meet to pool ideas and build projects in the field of sex and intimacy with artificial partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ferreira|first1=Elsa|title=At the first Sex Tech Hack, a hackathon on sexuality in London|url=http://www.makery.info/en/2016/12/20/au-premier-sex-tech-hack-un-hackathon-sur-la-sexualite-a-londres/|website=Makery|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Devlin appeared several times in the media debating ethical issues concerning [[sex robots]] with Kathleen Richardson, fellow of the ethics of robotics at [[De Montfort University]], and founder of Campaign Against Sex Robots which seeks to ban sex robots on the grounds that they encourage isolation, perpetuate the idea of women as property and are dehumanising.&lt;ref name=late2017/&gt;&lt;ref name="hufpo2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wosk|first1=Julie|title=Love and Sex With Robots Conference Sparks Controversy|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julie-wosk/love-and-sex-with-robots-_b_13739374.html|website=HuffPost|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devlin has argued that not only would a ban be impractical, but as technology develops more women need to be involved to diversify a field which is dominated by men creating products for heterosexual men. She also points out that the technology can be used as therapy, citing the use of artificial intelligence to treat anxiety,&lt;ref name="late2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wordsworth|first1=Matt|title=Lateline: Panel, Kathleen Richardson and Kate Devlin|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2016/s4581407.htm|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the possible application towards understanding the psychology of [[sex offenders]].&lt;ref name=conv2017/&gt;

Devlin frequently speaks at conferences and her areas of scientific interest include: the social and ethical problems of integrating [[artificial intelligence]] into sexual experience with computer systems and robots,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fay|first1=Joe|title=Reg Lecture: Sex, AI, Robots and You|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/08/reg_love_robots_lecture/|website=The Regiter|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yt2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=TEDx Talks|title=Sex Robots.

These concerns include: if robots gain self-awareness, will they be able to give informed consent and be entitled to make choices regarding their own desires, and should they be supplied to the elderly in [[Nursing home care|residential care facilities]] for companionship and sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reisz|first1=Matthew|title=The sexbots are coming: Scholars reflect on ethics and mechanics of a possible ‘sex tech’ future|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/sexbots-are-coming|website=Times Higher Education|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc2017/&gt;

Devlin was named one of London's most influential people 2017 by the Progress 1000, [[London Evening Standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Progress 1000|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/the1000/the-progress-1000-londons-most-influential-people-2017-boffins-science-technology-a3653581.html|website=London Evening Standard|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 Devlin released her book, ''Turned On: Science, Sex and Robots''. The book began as research into the technological development of sex robots and explores the relationship between technology and intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Law |first1=Katie |title=King's College's Kate Devlin on the future and ethics of the sex tech revolution |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/sex-tech-future-ethics-kate-devlin-a3959401.html |website=Evening Standard |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''La Casa de la Ciencia''' (''the House of Science'') in the city of [[Seville]], Spain is a centre for popularizing science.

Along with a museum, the building houses the Andalusian headquarters of the Spanish National Research Council ([[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]]). CSIC is the largest public institution devoted to research in Spain, and the third largest in Europe. The building was opened to the public in 2008, with the goal of sharing knowledge acquired through scientific research. La Casa de la Ciencia aims to be a bridge between the scientific research community and the public, sharing contemporary scientific research and information on environmental issues.
The museum achieves these goals by putting on various types of events, including exhibitions, conferences, seminars and workshops.
The museum contains three permanent exhibits, one temporary exhibit and a planetarium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==

The museum is housed in the Peruvian pavilion (''Pabellón de Perú''), a building of great beauty that was built in the [[Maria Luisa Park]] for the [[Ibero-American Exposition of 1929]]. In addition to being home to the offices of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas en Sevilla ([[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]]), the building also house the Peruvian Consulate.&lt;ref name="consuladoperusevilla.es"&gt;{{cite web

 |publisher=Consulado General del Perú en Sevilla
 |title=Consulado General del Perú en Sevilla
 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For twenty years the building was the headquarters of the Biological Station of Doñana and in April 2008 the city council of Seville provided a grant to renovate the building to create La Casa de la Ciencia.  In April 2008 the city council of Seville provided a grant to renovate the building to create La Casa de la Cienca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Building==

[[File:Pabellón Perú.jpg|thumb|right| Museum interior]]

The building was designed by the renowned architect Manuel Piqueras Cotolí (1885 – 1937). Cotoli was born in Lucena, Córdoba but moved to Peru to study and became known for his buildings which blended indigenous and colonial architecture. These buildings include the [[Escuela Nacional Superior Autónoma de Bellas Artes]], Pizarro´s Tomb in the [[Cathedral of Lima]], and the Archbishop's Palace. The blending of architectural styles is easily visible from the outside of La Casa de la Ciencia, and many parts of the building share similarities with Cotoli’s Peruvian works.

A part of the building holds the Consulate General of Peru in Seville.&lt;ref name="consuladoperusevilla.es"/&gt;
In July 2008 the Peruvian ambassador to Spain signed a 75-year renewal of the assignment by the City of Seville of the Pavilion of Peru to the Republic of Peru and to the CSIC. The CSIC had undertaken to provide a {{convert|3000|m2|sqft}} exhibition space open to the public dedicated to the extension of science in [[Andalusia]].

==Exterior==

The building lies on the Avenida Maria Luisa, noted for the [[Queen's sewing box]] (''Costurero de la Reina''), a unique building that takes the form of a small hexagonal castle with turrets at the corners, and the oldest building in Seville in the ''neomudéjar'' style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It is between the [[Seville Public Library]], inaugurated in 1999 by the [[Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo]], and the ''[[Teatro Lope de Vega Sevilla]]'', a small baroque-style theatre that was also built for the exhibition.&lt;ref name=visitarq&gt;{{cite web

The museum currently has three permanent exhibits open to the public, which showcase the [[flora]], [[fauna]] and [[minerals]] of the region: ''Invertebrates of Andalusia'', ''Geology of Seville'', and ''A Sea of Cetaceans in Andalusia''. The museum also contains Seville's only [[planetarium]].
 
Notable features include a clepsydra ([[Water clock]]) and an [[ecosphere (aquarium)]]. 
[[Peter O'Toole]]'s opening scene in [[Lawrence of Arabia]] was filmed in basement of the building, now used for meetings by [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]].

'''Last Glacial Maximum refugia''' were places where humans, and also other species, survived during the [[Last Glacial Maximum|last glacial period]] in the [[northern hemisphere]], around 25,000 to 20,000 years ago.

[[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Australia]] were not affected by the glaciation (although vast areas of those continents were then too dry for human habitation of any sort, even by the most specialised and well-adapted [[hunter-gatherer|foragers]]), and [[the Americas]] and [[New Zealand]] had no humans at that time. Therefore, the shelters are located mainly in [[Eurasia]]. Several of them have been studied.

This is a '''list of TCP and UDP port numbers''' used by protocols of the [[application layer]] of the [[Internet protocol suite]] for the establishment of host-to-host connectivity.

The [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) and the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) needed only one port for full-duplex, bidirectional traffic. The [[Stream Control Transmission Protocol]] (SCTP) and the [[Datagram Congestion Control Protocol]] (DCCP) also use port numbers. They usually use port numbers that match the services of the corresponding TCP or UDP implementation, if they exist.

The [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) is responsible for maintaining the official assignments of port numbers for specific uses.&lt;ref name="IANA"&gt;{{cite web
 |url= https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.txt
 |title= Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry
 |publisher= The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many unofficial uses of both well-known and registered port numbers occur in practice. Similarly many of the official assignments refer to protocols that were never or are no longer in common use. This article lists port numbers and their associated protocols that have experienced significant uptake.

==Table legend==

{{Dynamic list}}

The range of port numbers from 1024 to 49151 are the registered ports. They are assigned by [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] for specific service upon application by a requesting entity.&lt;ref name=IANA /&gt; On most systems, registered ports can be used without superuser privileges.

&lt;!-- In this table, the Port number, TCP and UDP columns are lined up

This list includes all [[List of impact craters on Earth#All craters listed alphabetically|11 confirmed impact craters]] in [[South America]] as listed in the [[Earth Impact Database]]. These features were caused by the collision of large [[meteorites]] or [[comets]] with the Earth. For eroded or buried craters, the stated diameter typically refers to an estimate of original [[rim (craters)|rim]] diameter, and may not correspond to present surface features.

== Unconfirmed impact craters ==
{{main|List of unconfirmed impact craters on Earth}}
The following craters are officially considered "unconfirmed" because they are not listed in the Earth Impact Database.  Due to stringent requirements regarding evidence and peer-reviewed publication, newly discovered craters or those with difficulty collecting evidence generally are known for some time before becoming listed.  However, entries on the unconfirmed list could still have an impact origin disproven.

'''Lithogenic silica''' (LSi) is [[silica]] that originates from terrestrial sources of rock and soil, i.e. from [[silicate minerals]] and crystals.

In the marine [[silicon]] cycle, LSi in the ocean is derived from rivers (5.6 Tmol Si/yr),{{efn|1= ''Tmol'' = Terramole =10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; [[mole (unit)|mole]]}} [[Aeolian processes|eolian]] dust (0.5 Tmol Si/yr), [[hydrothermal]] vents (0.2 Tmol Si/yr), [[basalt]] [[weathering]] (0.4 Tmol Si/yr), and from benthic fluxes (23 Tmol Si/yr) from the sediment into the ocean's interior ([[:fr:Paul Tréguer|Tréguer]] et al., 1995).

LSi can either be accumulated "directly" in marine sediments or be transferred into [[dissolved silica]] (DSi) in the water column.

The '''Maisonneuve fracture''' is a [[spiral fracture]] of the proximal third of the [[fibula]] associated with a tear of the distal [[Inferior tibiofibular joint|tibiofibular syndesmosis]] and the [[interosseous membrane of the leg|interosseous membrane]]. There is an associated fracture of the medial [[malleolus]] or rupture of the deep [[medial ligament of talocrural joint|deltoid ligament]]. This type of injury can be difficult to detect.  

The Maisonneuve fracture is similar to the [[Galeazzi fracture]] in the sense that there is an important ligamentous disruption in association with the fracture. The fracture is named after the surgeon [[Jules Germain François Maisonneuve]].

==Example==

===Telescope position servo===

[[File:Position servo and signal flow graph.png|right|thumb|600px| Angular position servo and [[signal flow graph]]. θ&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = desired angle command, θ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = actual load angle, K&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; = position loop gain, V&lt;sub&gt;ωC&lt;/sub&gt; = velocity command, V&lt;sub&gt;ωM&lt;/sub&gt; = motor velocity sense voltage, K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; = velocity loop gain, V&lt;sub&gt;IC&lt;/sub&gt; = current command, V&lt;sub&gt;IM&lt;/sub&gt; = current sense voltage, K&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = current loop gain, V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = power amplifier output voltage, L&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = motor inductance, I&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = motor current, R&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = motor resistance, R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = current sense resistance, K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = motor torque constant (Nm/amp), T = torque, M = moment of inertia of all rotating components α = angular acceleration, ω = angular velocity, β = mechanical damping, G&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = motor back EMF constant, G&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = tachometer conversion gain constant,. There is one forward path (shown in a different color) and six feedback loops. The drive shaft assumed to be stiff enough to not treat as a spring. Constants are shown in black and variables in purple. Intentional feedback is shown with dotted lines.]]

This example is slightly simplified (no gears between the motor and the load) from the control system for the [[Harlan J. Smith Telescope]] at the [[McDonald Observatory]].&lt;ref name="Dittmar"&gt;{{cite conference| first = David| last = Dittmar| title = | booktitle = Conference on Large Telescope Design, Proceedings of an ESO (European Southern Observatory)/CERN (Conseil Europeen pour la Recherche Nucleaire) Conference| pages = 383|publicationdate= June 1971| location = Geneva, Switzerland |date=1–5 Mar 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the figure there are three feedback loops: current control loop, velocity control loop and position control loop. The last is the main loop. The other two are minor loops. The forward path, considering only the forward path without the minor loop feedback, has three unavoidable phase shifting stages. The motor inductance and winding resistance form a [[low-pass filter]] with a bandwidth around 200&amp;nbsp;Hz. Acceleration to velocity is an [[integrator]] and velocity to position is an integrator. This would have a total [[Phase (waves)|phase shift]] of 180 to 270 degrees. Simply connecting position feedback would almost always result in unstable behaviour.

====Current control loop====
The innermost loop regulates the current in the [[Electric motor#Torque motor|torque motor]]. This type of motor creates torque that is nearly proportional to the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] current, even if it is forced to turn backward. Because of the action of the [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]], there are instances when two rotor windings are simultaneously energized. If the motor was driven by a voltage controlled voltage source, the current would roughly double, as would the torque. By sensing the current with a small sensing resister (R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;) and feeding that voltage back to the inverting input of the drive amplifier, the amplifier becomes a voltage controlled current source. With constant current, when two windings are energized, they share the current and the variation of torque is on the order of 10%.

====Velocity control loop====
The next innermost loop regulates motor speed. The voltage signal from the [[Tachometer]] (a small permanent magnet DC generator) is proportional to the angular velocity of the motor. This signal is fed back to the inverting input of the velocity control amplifier (K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;). The velocity control system makes the system 'stiffer' when presented with torque variations such as wind, movement about the second axis and [[torque ripple]] from the motor.

====Position control loop====
The outermost loop, the main loop, regulates load position. In this example, position feedback of the actual load position is presented by a [[Rotary encoder]] that produces a binary output code. The actual position is compared to the desired position by a digital subtracter that drives a DAC ([[Digital-to-analog converter]]) that drives the position control amplifier (K&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;).  Position control allows the servo to compensate for sag and for slight position ripple caused by gears (not shown) between the motor and the telescope
{{-}}

===Synthesis===

The usual design procedure is to design the innermost subsystem (the current control loop in the telescope example) using local feedback to linearize and flatten the gain. Stability is generally assured by Bode plot methods. Usually, the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] is made as wide as possible. Then the next loop (the velocity loop in the telescope example) is designed. The bandwidth of this sub-system is set to be a factor of 3 to 5 less than the bandwidth of the enclosed system. This process continues with each loop having less bandwidth than the bandwidth of the enclosed system. As long as the bandwidth of each loop is less than the bandwidth of the enclosed sub-system by a factor of 3 to 5, the phase shift of the enclosed system can be neglected, i.e. the sub-system can be treated as simple flat gain. Since the bandwidth of each sub-system is less than the bandwidth of the system it encloses, it is desirable to make the bandwidth of each sub-system as large as possible so that there is enough bandwidth in the outermost loop. The system is often expressed as a [[Signal-flow graph]] and its overall transfer function can be computed from [[Mason's rule|Mason's Gain Formula]].

'''Mississippi State Axion Search''' is the first of its kind light shining through the wall experiment designed to operate using a continuous [[radio wave]] emitter as the source of [[photons]]. The experiment contains a radio source and a set of detectors separated by a wall. The aim of the experiment is to limit the [[mass]] and [[coupling constant]]s of an [[axion]] like particle or a para photon by looking at the photons on the dark side of the tuned cavity. The experiment is projected to be completed by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/SES12/Event/181650 The Construction of Mississippi State Axion Search]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://meeting.aps.org/Meeting/SES12/Event/181697 Preliminary Results from Mississippi State Axion Search]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13997">The '''Nice 2 model''' is a model of the early evolution of the [[Solar System]]. The Nice 2 model resembles the [[Nice model|original Nice model]] in that a late instability of the outer Solar System results in gravitational encounters between planets, the disruption of an outer [[planetesimal]] disk, and the migrations of the [[outer planets]] to new orbits. However, the Nice 2 model differs in its initial conditions and in the mechanism for triggering the late instability. These changes reflect the analysis of the orbital evolution of the outer Solar System during the [[protoplanetary disk|gas disk]] phase and the inclusion of gravitational interactions between planetesimals in the outer disk into the model.

==Description==

The Nice 2 model begins with the outer planets in a stable quadruple [[orbital resonance|resonance]] with each planet in resonance with its nearest neighbors.&lt;ref name=Levison_2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levison|first=Harold F.|author2=Morbidelli, Alessandro |author3=Tsiganis, Kleomenis |author4=Nesvorný, David |author5= Gomes, Rodney |title=Late Orbital Instabilities in the Outer Planets Induced by Interaction with a Self-gravitating Planetesimal Disk|journal=The Astronomical Journal|year=2011|volume=142|issue=5|page=152|doi=10.1088/0004-6256/142/5/152|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-3881/142/5/152/pdf/aj_142_5_152.pdf|bibcode = 2011AJ....142..152L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One example among several potential stable quadruple resonance configurations is [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] in a 3:2 resonance, Saturn and Uranus in a 3:2 resonance, and [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]] in a 4:3 resonance.&lt;ref name=Morbidelli_2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morbidelli|first=Alessandro|title=A coherent and comprehensive model of the evolution of the outer Solar System|journal=Comptes Rendus Physique|year=2010|volume=11|issue=9–10|pages=651–659|doi=10.1016/j.crhy.2010.11.001|arxiv = 1010.6221 |bibcode = 2010CRPhy..11..651M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactions with an outer planetesimal disk that is gravitationally stirred by [[Pluto]]-sized objects cause the planets to migrate inward while remaining in resonance.&lt;ref name=Levison_2011 /&gt; During this migration the [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of the inner [[ice giant]] increases, leading to [[secular resonance|secular-resonance]] crossings.&lt;ref name=Levison_2011 /&gt; After several hundred million years, the resonant configuration is destabilized during one of these secular-resonance crossings.&lt;ref name=Levison_2011 /&gt; Gravitational encounters between the planets similar to those in the original Nice model begin shortly thereafter.

==Development==

The Nice 2 model addresses some weaknesses of the original Nice model. The first weakness is the artificial selection of the initial orbits of the outer planets to produce an instability that matches the timing of the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]].&lt;ref name=Morbidelli_2010 /&gt; The second weakness is the sensitivity of the timing of the instability to the location of the inner edge of the planetesimal disk.&lt;ref name=Morbidelli_2010 /&gt; The Nice 2 model uses particular initial conditions, derived from the examination of the orbital evolution of [[giant planet]]s orbiting in a gas disk,&lt;ref name=Levison_2011 /&gt; which may occur under appropriate circumstances.&lt;ref name=zhang_2010 /&gt; An instability trigger with no apparent correlation between the timing of the instability and the position of the inner edge of the planetesimal disk is the result of the incorporation of the interactions between planetesimals into the Nice 2 model.&lt;ref name=Levison_2011 /&gt;

==Initial conditions==

The initial orbits of the giant planets in the Nice 2 model correspond to a predicted orbital structure of the outer Solar System at the end of the gas disk phase.&lt;ref name=Morbidelli_2010 /&gt;  Models of giant planets orbiting in a gas disk predict that they would migrate toward the central star at a rate dependent on the mass of the planet and characteristics of the disk. In a system with multiple planets this migration can result in the convergence of the planet’s orbits and their capture into mean-motion resonances.&lt;ref name=masset_snellgrove_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Masset|first=F.|author2= Snellgrove, M. |title=Reversing type II migration: resonance trapping of a lighter giant protoplanet|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|year=2001|volume=320|issue=4|pages=L55-L59.|doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.2001.04159.x|arxiv = astro-ph/0003421 |bibcode = 2001MNRAS.320L..55M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morbidelli_Crida_2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morbidelli|first=Alessandro|author2=Crida, Aurélien |title=The dynamics of Jupiter and Saturn in the gaseous proto-planetary disk|journal=Icarus|year=2007|volume=191|issue=1|pages=158–171|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2007.04.001|arxiv=0704.1210|bibcode = 2007Icar..191..158M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations focusing on Jupiter and Saturn demonstrated that they can be captured in a 3:2 or 2:1 resonance depending on the characteristics of the protoplanetary disk.&lt;ref name=Pierens_Nelson_2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pierens|first=A.|author2=Nelson, R.

==Instability trigger==

The inclusion of gravitational interactions between planetesimals in the outer disk revealed an alternative mechanism for triggering the late instability of the outer planets. During numerical simulations that included the gravitational interactions between planetesimals, a transfer of energy between the disk and the planets was observed. This energy transfer led to the migration of the planets toward the Sun and occurred even when there were no encounters between planetesimals and the planets. As the migration progressed the eccentricity of the inner ice giant increased. In some of the simulations the quadruple resonance was eventually destabilized resulting in gravitational encounters between planets. The instability was observed in 25% of the simulations with the timing varying between 300 million and 1 billion years. No correlation between the location of the inner edge of the planetesimal disk and the occurrence or the timing of the instability was apparent.&lt;ref name=Levison_2011 /&gt;

Closer investigation using a simpler model with one planet and a planetesimal disk indicated that the energy transfer was due to a coupling between the eccentricity of the planetesimals in the outer belt and the semi-major axis of the planet. As a result of this coupling an increase in the average eccentricity of the planetesimal belt driven via the gravitational stirring by Pluto-sized objects yields a decrease in the [[semi-major axis]] of the planet. The coupling was found to be proportional to the eccentricity of the planet and in a multiple planet system would have its greatest effect on the most eccentric planet.&lt;ref name=Levison_2011 /&gt;

The increase in the eccentricity of the inner ice giant was found to be due to the varying strengths of the coupling between the planetesimal disk and the planets. The inner ice giant, with its higher eccentricity due to its resonant capture of the outer ice giant, would normally migrate at a faster rate than the other planets. However, since the resonant configuration requires that the migration be synchronized, the inner ice giant must drag the other planets along. The increase in the inner ice giant’s eccentricity is a result of this process.&lt;ref name=Levison_2011 /&gt;

Examination of the orbital evolution of the planets revealed that the destabilization of their orbits was due to secular resonance crossings. The increase of the eccentricity of the inner ice giant during the migration led to the slow variation of the precession frequencies of the planets. Secular resonances occurred when these frequencies became similar. The eccentricity of the inner ice giant fluctuated during these secular resonance crossings, sometimes dropping enough to cause the breaking of the quadruple resonance. Whether the quadruple resonance broke was determined by the strength of the secular resonance and the time spent in the secular resonance.&lt;ref name=Levison_2011 /&gt;

The nature of the instability mechanism is responsible for the lack of a correlation between the distance to the inner edge of the planetesimal belt and the timing of the instability. If the inner edge of the planetesimal disk is close the migration of the planets occurs at a faster rate. More secular resonance crossings occur but since less time is spent in each one only the strongest can break the quadruple resonance.  The reverse is true for a more distant planetesimal belt. As a result of the conflict between these factors the timing and the occurrence of the instability is fairly independent of the distance to the inner edge of the planetesimal belt.&lt;ref name=Levison_2011 /&gt;

==Potential issues and an alternative==

A study using a numerical simulation that included gravitational interactions among all objects revealed that a dynamical instability occurred in less than 70 million years. Interactions between planetesimals dynamically heated the disk and lead to earlier interactions between the planetesimals and giant planets. This study used a limited number of planetesimals due to computational constraints so it is as yet unknown whether this result would apply to a more complete disk.&lt;ref name="Reyes-Ruiz_etal_2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reyes-Ruiz|first1=M.|last2=Aceves|first2=H.|last3=Chavez|first3=C. E.|title=Stability of the Outer Planets in Multiresonant Configurations with a Self-gravitating Planetesimal Disk|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2014|volume=804|issue=2|page=91|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/804/2/91|arxiv=1406.2341|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/804/2/91/meta|bibcode=2015ApJ...804...91R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of the late destabilization of a five planet resonant chain and an extended migration of Neptune is unlikely. Reproducing the orbital distribution of the Kuiper belt objects requires that Neptune undergo a migration of several AU, reaching 28 AU before the encounters between planets begin. This migration of Neptune is likely if the planetesimal disk began within 2 AU of Neptune's initial orbit. However, a late destabilization of the resonance chain requires a more distant disk, at least 4 AU beyond Neptune's orbit.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017" /&gt;

An early breaking of the resonance chain followed by a slow dust-driven migration may bridge this gap. The dust- driven is the result of collision among the planetesimals producing debris that is ground to dust in a collisional cascade. The dust then spirals toward the orbits of the planets due to Poynting-Robertson drag. Interactions with this dust disrupts the resonance chain and drive their migration toward the planetesimal disk over a several hundred million years period.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deienno|first1=Rogerio|last2=Morbidelli|first2=Alessandro|last3=Gomes|first3=Rodney S.|last4=Nesvorny|first4=David|title=Constraining the giant planets' initial configuration from their evolution: implications for the timing of the planetary instability|date=2017|arxiv=1702.02094|doi=10.3847/1538-3881/aa5eaa|volume=153|journal=The Astronomical Journal|issue=4|page=153|bibcode = 2017AJ....153..153D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The instability mechanism of the Nice 2 model becomes irrelevant if the dust generated by collisions among the planetesmals  disrupts a resonant chain early.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2139">In [[astronomy]], an '''octaeteris''' (plural: '''octaeterides''') is the period of eight [[solar year]]s after which the [[moon phase]] occurs on the same day of the year plus one or two days.

This period is also in a very good synchronicity with five [[Venus]]ian visibility cycles (the Venusian [[synodic period]]) and thirteen Venusian revolutions around the sun (Venusian [[sidereal period]]). This means, that if [[Venus]] is visible beside the [[moon]], after eight years the two will be again close together near the same date of the [[calendar]].

The octaeteris, also known as ''oktaeteris'', was noted by [[Cleostratus]] in [[ancient Greece]] as a 2923.5 day cycle.  The 8 year short lunisolar cycle was probably known to many ancient cultures.  The mathematical proportions of the octaeteris cycles were noted in Classic Vernal rock art in northeastern [[Utah]] by J. Q. Jacobs in 1990. The Three Kings panel also contains more accurate ratios, ratios related to other planets, and apparent astronomical symbolism.

The octaeteris is the calendar used for the Olympic games, every four years and the Greek use 50 months of one Olympiad, four-year cycle and 49 lunarmonths for the next Olympiad. This octaeteris calendar exist in the [[Antikythera Mechanism]] and is used for the Olympic dial of this ancient automaton, to determine the time of the Olympic games and other Greek festivities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3762">'''Peter David Drummond''' is a physicist and Distinguished Professor in the Centre for Quantum and Optical Science at [[Swinburne University of Technology]].

Drummond was born in [[New Zealand]] in 1950, and was educated at [[Auckland University]], where he graduated a B. Sc. (Hons), at Harvard where he received an  A. M. (masters) degree, and  at the [[University of Waikato]] in New Zealand, where his D. Phil. degree was supervised by [[Dan Walls]] and [[Crispin Gardiner]]. He  worked as a postdoctoral researcher with [[Joseph H. Eberly]] at [[Rochester University]], and then as an academic at [[Auckland University]] before being appointed to a chair of physics at [[Queensland University]] in 1989. He moved to [[Swinburne University of Technology]] in 2008.

==Areas of Research==

* Drummond and [[Crispin Gardiner]]  developed the positive-P&lt;ref name=PosP&gt;{{Cite journal|first=P D|last=Drummond|first2 =C W|last2=Gardiner|title=Generalised P-Representations in Quantum Optics|journal=J Phys A|year=1980|volume=13|pages=2353|bibcode=1980JPhA...13.2353D|doi=10.1088/0305-4470/13/7/018}} &lt;/ref&gt; phase-space representation.

*His current research is at the intersection of atomic, molecular and optical physics, quantum information, quantum technology, condensed matter physics, and computational physics. The field is driven by an unprecedented level of experimental control of isolated quantum systems. Techniques used include novel computational methods that map quantum dynamics into stochastic equations on a generalized phase-space. These methods have applications to a wide range of complex physical, chemical and biological systems, including: photonics, condensed matter, Bose-Einstein condensates, strongly-correlated fermions, astrophysics, nano-chemical reactions, opto-mechanics and biophysics. Drummond's contributions to physics range from fundamental theorems in operator representation theory to the practical implementation of algorithms, and comparisons to experiment. 

==Awards and Honours==

* In 2002 he was awarded the Forschungspreis, the Senior Research Award of the German Humboldt Society.

* In 2004 he was awarded the [[Harrie Massey Medal and Prize]] for his contributions to [[physics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aip.org.au/medals-awards-and-prizes/harrie-massey-medal/ Harrie Massey Medal.] [[Australian Institute of Physics]]. Retrieved 8 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2007 he was awarded the Moyal medal of Macquarie University.

* In 2008 he received the Boas medal of the Australian Institute of Physics.

* He was awarded the status of Fellow in the [[American Physical Society]], after being nominated by their Forum on International Physics in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aps.org/programs/honors/fellowships/archive-all.cfm?initial=&amp;year=2000&amp;unit_id=&amp;institution=|title=APS Fellows 2000|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aps.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; for ''pioneering theoretical studies of quantum noise in nonlinear optical processes, including superfluorescence, optical bistability, parametric amplification and oscillation, fiber-optical solitons, proposed tests of quantum correlations, and the positive-P representation.''

* He was also awarded the status of Fellow in the [[Australian Academy of Science]] in 2003, for ''tests of quantum theory, theory of solitons, computational physics, physics of communication and information, laser physics, and Bose-Einstein condensation.''

'''STS-400''' was the [[Space Shuttle]] [[STS-3xx|contingency support]] (Launch On Need) flight that would have been launched using {{OV|105}} if a major problem occurred on {{OV|104}} during [[STS-125]], the final [[Hubble Space Telescope]] servicing mission (HST SM-4).&lt;ref name="FP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/345918main_FLT_PLN_400_B.pdf|title=STS-400 Flight Plan|author=[[NASA]] Mission Operations Directorate|date=2 June 2008|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 May 2009|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rescueplan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/sts400-ready-and-waiting.html|title=STS-400: Ready and Waiting|author=NASA|date=5 May 2009|publisher=NASA|accessdate=17 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UTRescue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universetoday.com/2009/04/17/the-sts-400-shuttle-rescue-mission-scenario/|title=The STS-400 Shuttle Rescue Mission Scenario|first=Nancy |last=Atkinson|date=17 April 2009|publisher=[[Universe Today]]|accessdate=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NSF-singlepad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2009/01/sts-125400-single-pad-option-progress-protect-ares-i-x/|title=STS-125/400 Single Pad option progress – aim to protect Ares I-X|last=Bergin|first=Chris|date=19 January 2009|publisher=[[NASASpaceflight.com]]|accessdate=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the much lower [[orbital inclination]] of the HST compared to the ISS, the shuttle crew would have been unable to use the [[International Space Station]] as a "safe haven," and NASA would not have been able to follow the [[STS-3xx|usual plan]] of recovering the crew with another shuttle at a later date.&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt;  Instead, NASA developed a plan to conduct a shuttle-to-shuttle rescue mission, similar to [[STS-3xx#Pre-ISS era|proposed rescue missions for pre-ISS flights]].&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="move"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2006/05/hubble-servicing-mission-moves-up/|title=Hubble Servicing Mission moves up|date=9 May 2006|accessdate=16 October 2007|publisher=NASASpaceflight.com|first=Chris |last=Bergin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rescue"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2006/07/nasa-evaluates-rescue-options-for-hubble-mission/|title=NASA Evaluates Rescue Options for Hubble Mission|accessdate=16 October 2007|date=31 July 2007|publisher=NASASpaceflight.com|first=John |last=Copella}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rescue mission would have been launched only three days after call-up and as early as seven days after the launch of STS-125, since the crew of ''Atlantis'' would only have about three weeks of consumables after launch.&lt;ref name="Rescueplan"/&gt;

The mission was first rolled out in September 2008 to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39B]] two weeks after the STS-125 shuttle was rolled out to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39A]], creating a rare scenario in which two shuttles were on launch pads at the same time.&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt; In October 2008, however, STS-125 was delayed and rolled back to the [[Vehicle Assembly Building|VAB]].

Initially, STS-125 was retargeted for no earlier than February 2009. This changed the STS-400 vehicle from [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']] to [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']]. The mission was redesignated STS-401 due to the swap from ''Endeavour'' to ''Discovery''. STS-125 was then delayed further, allowing ''Discovery'' mission [[STS-119]] to fly beforehand. This resulted in the rescue mission reverting to ''Endeavour'', and the STS-400 designation being reinstated.&lt;ref name="NSF-singlepad"/&gt;  In January, 2009, it was announced that NASA was evaluating conducting both launches from Complex 39A in order to avoid further delays to [[Ares I-X]], which, at the time, was scheduled for launch from LC-39B in the September 2009 timeframe.&lt;ref name="NSF-singlepad"/&gt;  It was planned that after the STS-125 mission in October 2008, Launch Complex 39B would undergo the conversion for use in [[Project Constellation]] for the [[Ares I-X]] rocket.&lt;ref name="NSF-singlepad"/&gt; Several of the members on the NASA mission management team said at the time (2009) that single-pad operations were possible, but the decision was made to use both pads.&lt;ref name="Rescueplan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt;

== Early mission plans ==
[[File:Space shuttles Atlantis (STS-125) and Endeavour (STS-400) on launch pads.jpg|thumb|''Atlantis'' (foreground) and ''Endeavour'' on LC-39A and LC-39B in 2008.]]
Three different concept mission plans were evaluated: The first would be to use a shuttle-to-shuttle docking, where the rescue shuttle docks with the damaged shuttle, by flying upside down and backwards, relative to the damaged shuttle.&lt;ref name="rescue" /&gt; It was unclear whether this would be practical, as the forward structure of either orbiter could collide with the payload bay of the other, resulting in damage to both orbiters. The second option that was evaluated, would be for the rescue orbiter to rendezvous with the damaged orbiter, and perform station-keeping while using its [[Canadarm|Remote Manipulator System]] (RMS) to transfer crew from the damaged orbiter. This mission plan would result in heavy fuel consumption. The third concept would be for the damaged orbiter to grapple the rescue orbiter using its RMS, eliminating the need for station-keeping.&lt;ref name="briefingmats"/&gt; The rescue orbiter would then transfer crew using its RMS, as in the second option, and would be more fuel efficient than the station-keeping option.&lt;ref name="rescue" /&gt;

The concept that was eventually decided upon was a modified version of the third concept. The rescue orbiter would use its RMS to grapple the end of the damaged orbiter's RMS.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rescue2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2007/10/sts-400-nasa-draws-up-their-hubble-rescue-plans/|title=
STS-400 – NASA draws up their Hubble rescue plans|accessdate=16 October 2007|publisher=NASASpaceflight.com|date=11 October 2007|first=Chris |last=Bergin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preparations ==
[[File:STS400CT.svg|thumb|Diagram showing one of the proposals for crew and equipment transfers during STS-400.]]
After its most recent mission ([[STS-123]]), ''Endeavour'' was taken to the [[Orbiter Processing Facility]] for routine maintenance. Following the maintenance, ''Endeavour'' was on stand-by for [[STS-326]] which would have been flown in the case that [[STS-124]] would not have been able to return to Earth safely. Stacking of the [[solid rocket booster]]s (SRB) began on 11 July 2008. One month later, the [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]] arrived at KSC and was mated with the SRBs on 29 August 2008. ''Endeavour'' joined the stack on 12 September 2008 and was rolled out to Pad 39B one week later.

Since STS-126 launched before STS-125, ''Atlantis'' was rolled back to the VAB on 20 October, and ''Endeavour'' rolled around to Launch Pad 39A on 23 October. When it was time to launch STS-125, ''Atlantis'' rolled out to pad 39A.&lt;ref name="NSF-singlepad"/&gt;

== Mission plan ==
The Mission would not have included the extended heatshield inspection normally performed on flight day two.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt; Instead, an inspection would have been performed after the crew was rescued.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt; On flight day two, ''Endeavour'' would have performed the rendezvous and grapple with ''Atlantis''.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="briefingmats"/&gt; On flight day three, the first [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] would have been performed.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="briefingmats"/&gt; During the first EVA, Megan McArthur, Andrew Feustel and John Grunsfeld would have set up a tether between the airlocks.&lt;ref name="Rescueplan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt; They would have also transferred a large size [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit]] (EMU) and, after McArthur had repressurized, transferred McArthur's EMU back to ''Atlantis''. Afterwards they would have repressurized on ''Endeavour'', ending flight day two activities.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;

The final two EVA were planned for flight day three.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt; During the first, Grunsfeld would have depressurized on ''Endeavour'' in order to assist Gregory Johnson and Michael Massimino in transferring an EMU to ''Atlantis''. He and Johnson would then repressurize on ''Endeavour'', and Massimino would have gone back to ''Atlantis''.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt; He, along with Scott Altman and Michael Good would have taken the rest of the equipment and themselves to ''Endeavour'' during the final EVA. They would have been standing by in case the RMS system should malfunction.&lt;ref name="rescue2" /&gt; The damaged orbiter would have been commanded by the ground to deorbit and go through landing procedures over the Pacific, with the impact area being north of Hawaii.&lt;ref name="Rescueplan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt; On flight day five, ''Endeavour'' would have had a full heat shield inspection, and land on flight day eight.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rescueplan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt;

This mission could have marked the end of the Space Shuttle program, as it is considered unlikely that the program would have been able to continue with just two remaining [[Space Shuttle orbiter|orbiter]]s, ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'' and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Watson | first = Traci | title = The mission NASA hopes won't happen |work=USA Today | date = 22 March 2005  | url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2005-03-22-shuttle-cover_x.htm  | accessdate =13 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Thursday, 21 May 2009, NASA officially released ''Endeavour'' from the rescue mission, freeing the orbiter to begin processing for [[STS-127]]. This also allowed NASA to continue processing LC-39B for the upcoming Ares I-X launch, as during the stand-down period, NASA installed a new lightning protection system, similar to those found on the [[Atlas V]] and [[Delta IV]] pads, to protect the newer, taller Ares I rocket from lightning strikes.&lt;ref name="FD11a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts125/090521fd11/index2.html|title=Iffy weather forecast for Friday's shuttle landing|first=William |last=Harwood |date=21 May 2009|publisher=CBS News, Spaceflightnow.com|accessdate=22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Bergin|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2009/05/atlantis-sets-sights-saturday-endeavour-sts-127-flow/|title=Endeavour in STS-127 flow|date=22 May 2009|publisher=NASA Spaceflight.com|accessdate=24 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stress fracture''' is a fatigue-induced fracture of the bone caused by repeated stress over time. Instead of resulting from a single severe impact, stress fractures are the result of accumulated [[Injury|trauma]] from repeated submaximal loading, such as running or jumping.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/706805938|title=Essentials of musculoskeletal care|date=2010|publisher=American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|others=Sarwark, John F.|isbn=9780892035793|location=Rosemont, Ill.|oclc=706805938}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this mechanism, stress fractures are common overuse injuries in athletes.&lt;ref name="Stress Fractures of the Pelvis and Legs in Athletes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Behrens|first=Steve|author2=Deren, Matson|author3=Fadale, Monchik|title=Stress Fractures of the Pelvis and Legs in Athletes|journal=Sports Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach|date=March–April 2013|volume=5|issue=2|pages=165–174|doi=10.1177/1941738112467423|url=http://sph.sagepub.com/content/5/2/165.abstract|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140519214719/http://sph.sagepub.com/content/5/2/165.abstract|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-05-19|accessdate=2014-05-19|pmc=3658382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stress fractures can be described as very small slivers or cracks in the [[bone]];&lt;ref name="titleStress fractures - MayoClinic.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/stress-fractures/DS00556 |title=Stress fractures - MayoClinic.com |accessdate=2007-12-23 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are sometimes referred to as "hairline fractures." Stress fractures most frequently occur in weight-bearing bones, such as the [[tibia]] (bone of the lower leg), [[metatarsals]], and [[navicular bones]] (bones of the foot). Less common are fractures to the femur, pelvis, and sacrum.&lt;ref name="Martinez"&gt;{{cite web|last=Martinez|first=John|title=Stress Fractures|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1270244-overview|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Stress fractures are typically discovered after a rapid increase in exercise.  They most commonly present as pain with [[weight bearing]] that increases with activity. The pain usually subsides with rest but may be constantly present with a more serious bone injury.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  There is usually an area of localized tenderness on or near the bone and generalized swelling in the area. Percussion or palpation to the bone may reproduce symptoms.&lt;ref name="Martinez"/&gt; Anterior tibial stress fractures elicit focal tenderness on the anterior tibial crest, while posterior medial stress fractures can be tender at the posterior tibial border.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Causes==
Bones are constantly attempting to remodel and repair themselves, especially during a sport where extraordinary stress is applied to the bone. Over time, if enough stress is placed on the bone that it exhausts the capacity of the bone to remodel, a weakened site—a stress fracture—may appear on the bone. The fracture does not appear suddenly. It occurs from repeated traumas, none of which is sufficient to cause a sudden break, but which, when added together, overwhelm the [[osteoblast]]s that remodel the bone.

Stress fractures commonly occur in sedentary people who suddenly undertake a burst of exercise (whose bones are not used to the task). They may also occur in athletes completing high volume, high impact training, such as running or jumping sports.  Stress fractures are also commonly reported in soldiers who march long distances.

[[Muscle fatigue]] can also play a role in the occurrence of stress fractures. In a runner, each stride normally exerts large forces  at various points in the legs. Each shock—a rapid acceleration and energy transfer—must be absorbed. Muscles and bones serve as [[shock absorbers]]. However, the muscles, usually those in the lower leg, become fatigued after running a long distance and lose their ability to absorb shock. As the bones now experience larger stresses, this increases the risk of fracture.

Previous stress fractures have been identified as a risk factor.&lt;ref name="pmid17805074"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kelsey JL |title=Risk factors for stress fracture among young female cross-country runners |journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=1457–63 |year=2007 |pmid=17805074 |doi=10.1249/mss.0b013e318074e54b |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?an=00005768-200709000-00003 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Bachrach LK |author3=Procter-Gray E |display-authors=3 |last4=Nieves |first4=Jeri |last5=Greendale |first5=Gail A. |last6=Sowers |first6=Maryfran |last7=Brown |first7=Byron W. |last8=Matheson |first8=KIM A. |last9=Crawford |first9=Sybil L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[X-rays]] usually do not show evidence of new stress fractures, but can be used 3 weeks after onset of pain when the bone begins to remodel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A [[CT scan]], [[MRI]], or [[Bone scan|3-phase bone scan]] may be more effective for early diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pelletier-Galarneau M, Martineau P, Gaudreault M, Pham X |title=Review of running injuries of the foot and ankle: clinical presentation and SPECT-CT imaging patterns |journal=Am J Nucl Med Mol Imaging |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=305–16 |year=2015 |pmid=26269770 |pmc=4529586 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MRI appears to be the most accurate test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=AA|last2=Hegedus|first2=EJ|last3=Lenchik|first3=L|last4=Kuhn|first4=KJ|last5=Santiago|first5=L|last6=Smoliga|first6=JM|title=Diagnostic Accuracy of Various Imaging Modalities for Suspected Lower Extremity Stress Fractures: A Systematic Review With Evidence-Based Recommendations for Clinical Practice.|journal=The American Journal of Sports Medicine|date=January 2016|volume=44|issue=1|pages=255–63|pmid=25805712|doi=10.1177/0363546515574066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Altering the biomechanics of training and training schedules may reduce the prevalence of stress fractures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=Deepak S.|last2=Roth|first2=Matt|last3=Kapil|first3=Neha|date=2011-01-01|title=Stress fractures: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention|journal=American Family Physician|volume=83|issue=1|pages=39–46|issn=0002-838X|pmid=21888126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orthotic insoles have been found to decrease the rate of stress fractures in military recruits, but it is unclear whether this can be extrapolated to the general population or athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Rebecca A.|last2=DeAngelis|first2=Joseph P.|last3=Koester|first3=Michael C.|last4=Spindler|first4=Kurt P.|last5=Dunn|first5=Warren R.|date=2009|title=Does Shoe Insole Modification Prevent Stress Fractures?

Some Athletes Say Running Shoeless Benefits Body and Sole|author=Tara Parker-Pope|date=June 6, 2006|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;!-- original: http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/UserFiles/File/Wall_Street_Journal6-6-2006.jpg --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During exercise that applies more stress to the bones, it may help to increase daily [[calcium]] (2,000&amp;nbsp;mg) and [[vitamin D]] (800 IU) intake, depending on the individual.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Treatment==

For low-risk stress fractures, rest is the best management option.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The amount of recovery time varies greatly depending upon the location and severity of the fracture, and the body's healing response. Complete rest and a stirrup leg brace or [[walking boot]] are usually used for a period of four to eight weeks, although periods of rest of twelve weeks or more are not uncommon for more severe stress fractures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After this period, activities may be gradually resumed as long as the activities do not cause pain. While the bone may feel healed and not hurt during daily activity, the process of bone remodeling may take place for many months after the injury feels healed. Incidences of refracturing the bone are still a significant risk.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Activities such as running or sports that place additional stress on the bone should only gradually be resumed. [[physical therapy|Rehabilitation]] usually includes muscle strength training to help dissipate the forces transmitted to the bones.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

With severe stress fractures (see "prognosis"), [[surgery]] may be needed for proper healing. The procedure may involve [[Percutaneous pinning|pinning]] the fracture site, and rehabilitation can take up to six months.

== Prognosis ==
Anterior tibial stress fractures can have a particularly poor prognosis and can require surgery. On radiographic imaging these stress fractures are referred to as the "dreaded black line." When compared to other stress fractures, anterior tibial fractures are more likely to progress to complete fracture of the tibia and displacement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Superior femoral neck stress fractures, if left untreated, can progress to become complete fractures with avascular necrosis, and should also be managed surgically.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaeding|first=Christopher C|last2=Yu|first2=James R|last3=Wright|first3=Rick|last4=Amendola|first4=Annunziato|last5=Spindler|first5=Kurt P|title=Management and Return to Play of Stress Fractures|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00042752-200511000-00009|journal=Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine|volume=15|issue=6|pages=442–447|doi=10.1097/01.jsm.0000188207.62608.35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proximal metadiaphyseal fractures of the fifth [[Metatarsal bones|metatarsal]] (middle of the outside edge of the foot) are also notorious for poor bone healing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These stress fractures heal slowly with significant risk of refracture.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delee|first=Jesse C.|last2=Evans|first2=J.

==Epidemiology==
In the US, the annual incidence of stress fractures in athletes and military recruits ranges from 5% to 30%, depending on the sport and other risk factors.&lt;ref name="titleeMedicine - Stress Fracture : Article by Jonathan C Reeser, MD, PhD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/pmr/topic134.htm |title=eMedicine – Stress Fracture : Article by Jonathan C Reeser, MD, PhD |accessdate=2007-12-23 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women and highly active individuals are also at a higher risk. The incidence probably also increases with age due to age-related reductions in bone mass density (BMD). Children may also be at risk because their bones have yet to reach full density and strength. The [[female athlete triad]] also can put women at risk as disordered eating and osteoporosis can cause the bones to be severely weakened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nattiv|first=Aurelia|last2=Loucks|first2=Anne B.|last3=Manore|first3=Melinda M.|last4=Sanborn|first4=Charlotte F.|last5=Sundgot-Borgen|first5=Jorunn|last6=Warren|first6=Michelle P.|last7=American College of Sports Medicine|date=October 2007|title=American College of Sports Medicine position stand.

==Other animals==

===Dinosaurs===
[[File:Allosaurus SDNHM.jpg|thumb|''[[Allosaurus fragilis]]'' was found to have the most stress fractures of any dinosaur examined in a 2001 study.]] 
In 2001, Bruce Rothschild and other [[paleontologists]] published a study examining evidence for [[stress fractures]] in [[theropod]] dinosaurs and analyzed the implications such injuries would have for reconstructing their behavior. Since stress fractures are due to repeated events they are probably caused by expressions of regular behavior rather than chance [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]]. The researchers paid special attention to evidence of injuries to the hand since dinosaurs' hind feet would be more prone to injuries received while running or migrating. Hand injuries, meanwhile, were more likely to be caused by struggling prey. Stress fractures in dinosaur bones can be identified by looking for bulges on the shafts of bones that face toward the front of the animal. When x-rayed, these bulges often show lines of clear space where the x-rays have a harder time traveling through the bone. Rothschild and the other researchers noted that this "zone of attenuation" seen under the x-ray typically cannot be seen with the naked eye.&lt;ref name="rothschild-dino" /&gt;

The researchers described theropod phalanges as being "[[pathognomonic]]" for stress fractures, this means they are "characteristic and unequivocal diagnostically." Rothschild and the other researchers examined and dismissed other kinds of injury and sickness as causes of the lesions they found on the dinosaurs' bones. [[Lesions]] left by stress fractures can be distinguished from [[osteomyelitis]] without difficulty because of a lack of bone destruction in stress fracture lesions. They can be distinguished from benign bone [[tumors]] like [[osteoid osteoma]] by the lack of a sclerotic perimeter. No disturbance of the internal bony architecture of the sort caused by malignant bone tumors was encountered among the stress fracture candidates. No evidence of [[metabolic disorders]] like [[hyperparathyroidism]] or [[hyperthyroidism]] was found in the specimens, either.&lt;ref name="rothschild-dino" /&gt;

After examining the bones of many kinds of dinosaur the researchers noted that ''[[Allosaurus]]'' had a significantly greater number of bulges on the shafts of its hand and foot bones than the [[tyrannosaur]] ''[[Albertosaurus]]'', or the [[ostrich dinosaurs]] ''[[Ornithomimus]]'' and ''[[Archaeornithomimus]]''. Most of the stress fractures observed along the lengths of ''Allosaurus'' toe bones were confined to the ends closest to the hind foot, but were spread across all three major digits in "statistically indistinguishable" numbers. Since the lower end of the third metatarsal would have contacted the ground first while a theropod was running it would have borne the most stress and should be most predisposed to suffer stress fractures. The lack of such a bias in the examined fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running. The authors conclude that these fractures occurred during interaction with prey. They suggest that such injuries could occur as a result of the theropod trying to hold struggling prey with its feet. The presence of stress fractures provide evidence for very active predation-based feeding rather than scavenging diets.&lt;ref name="rothschild-dino"&gt;Rothschild, B., Tanke, D. H., and Ford, T. L., 2001, Theropod stress fractures and tendon avulsions as a clue to activity: In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University Press, p. 331-336.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taftian theory''' (also "Whig" theory)&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Korzi (2003) Presidential Studies Quarterly, Vol. 33. ''Our Chief Magistrate and His Powers: A Reconsideration of William Howard Taft's "Whig" Theory of Presidential Leadership''&lt;/ref&gt; is a political term in the United States referring to a [[strict constructionist]] view regarding presidential power and the [[United States Constitution]], where a president's power is limited to those powers specifically enumerated by the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dound.com/school/gov/Ch8Terms.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="accd.edu"&gt;http://www.accd.edu/sac/gov/alfaro/executive.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Taftian Theory was coined after the governing style of the 27th president of the United States, [[William Howard Taft]]. Most presidents prior to [[Franklin D Roosevelt]] subscribed to this theory, as where more recent presidents subscribe to a [[stewardship theory]].&lt;ref name="accd.edu"/&gt;

'''Taylor's law''' (also known as '''Taylor's power law''') is an empirical law in [[ecology]] that relates the [[variance]] of the [[population density|number of individuals of a species per unit area]] of habitat to the corresponding [[mean]] by a [[power law]] relationship.&lt;ref name=Taylor1961&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=L. R. |year=1961 |title=Aggregation, variance and the mean |journal=Nature |volume=189 |issue=4766 |pages=732–735 |doi=10.1038/189732a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after the ecologist who first proposed it in 1961, [[Roy Taylor (ecologist)|Lionel Roy Taylor]] (1924–2007).&lt;ref name=Southwood1966&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas R.

Southwood |title=Ecological methods, with particular reference to the study of insect populations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StwPAQAAMAAJ |year=1966 |publisher=Methuen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor's original name for this relationship was the law of the mean.&lt;ref name=Taylor1961/&gt;

==Definition==
This law was originally defined for ecological systems, specifically to assess the spatial clustering of organisms. For a population count ''Y'' with mean ''µ'' and variance var(''Y''), Taylor's law is written,

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{var} (Y) = a\mu^b,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' are both positive constants. Taylor proposed this relationship in 1961, suggesting that the exponent ''b'' be considered a species specific index of aggregation.&lt;ref name="Taylor1961"/&gt; This power law has subsequently been confirmed for many hundreds of species.&lt;ref name=Taylor1980&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=L.

==History==

The first use of a double log-log plot was by [[Osborne Reynolds|Reynolds]] in 1879 on thermal aerodynamics.&lt;ref name=Reynolds1879&gt;Reynolds O (1879) On certain dimensional properties of matter in the gaseous state. Part I. Experimental researches on thermal transpiration of gases through porous plates and on the laws of  transpiration and impulsion, including an experimental proof that gas is not a continuous plenum. Part II. On an extension of the dynamical theory of gas, which includes the stresses, tangential and normal, caused by a varying condition of gas, and affords an explanation of the phenomena of transpiration and impulsion. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London 170:727-845&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] used a similar plot to study the proportion of a population and their income.&lt;ref name=Pareto1897&gt;Pareto V (1897) Cours D'économie Politique. Volume 2. Lausanne: F. Rouge&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The term ''[[variance]]'' was coined by [[Ronald Fisher|Fisher]] in 1918.&lt;ref name=Fisher1918&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fisher | first=RA | title=The correlation between relatives on the supposition of Mendelian inheritance | journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh | year=1918 | volume=52 | pages=399–433 | doi=10.1017/S0080456800012163 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = a m + b m^2 &lt;/math&gt;

[[Jerzy Neyman|Neyman]] studied the relationship between the sample mean and variance in 1926.&lt;ref name=Neyman1926&gt;Neyman J (1926) On the correlation of the mean and the variance in samples drawn from an "infinite" population. Biometrika 18:401–413&lt;/ref&gt; [[M. S.

J Roy Stat Soc Supplement 3: 185–194&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = a m + b m^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Smith in 1938 while studying crop yields proposed a relationship similar to Taylor's.&lt;ref name=Smith1938&gt;Smith HF (1938) An empirical law describing heterogeneity in the yield of agricultural crops. J Agric Sci 28: 1-23&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship was

: &lt;math&gt; \log V_x = \log V_1 + b\log x \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is the variance of yield for plots of ''x'' units, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the variance of yield per unit area and ''x'' is the size of plots. The slope (''b'') is the index of heterogeneity. The value of ''b'' in this relationship lies between 0 and 1. Where the yield are highly correlated ''b'' tends to 0; when they are uncorrelated ''b'' tends to 1.

Bliss&lt;ref name=Bliss1941&gt;Bliss CI (1941) Statistical problems in estimating populations of Japanese beetle larve. ''J Econ Entomol'' 34, 221-232&lt;/ref&gt; in 1941, Fracker and Brischle&lt;ref name=Fracker1944&gt;Fracker SB &amp; Brischle HA (1944) Measuring the local distribution of ''Ribes''. Ecology 25: 283–303&lt;/ref&gt; in 1941 and Hayman &amp; Lowe &lt;ref name=Hayman1961&gt;Hayman BI &amp; Lowe AD (1961) The transformation of counts of the cabbage aphid (''Brevicovyne brassicae'' (L.)) NZ J Sci 4:271–278&lt;/ref&gt; in 1961 also described what is now known as Taylor's law, but in the context of data from single species.

L. R. Taylor (1924–2007) was an English entomologist who worked on the Rothamsted Insect Survey for pest control. His 1961 paper used data from 24 papers published between 1936 and 1960. These papers considered a variety of biological settings: [[virus]] lesions, [[zooplankton|macro-zooplankton]], [[worm]]s and [[symphylid]]s in [[soil]], [[insect]]s in soil, on [[plant]]s and in the air, [[mite]]s on [[leaf|leaves]], [[tick]]s on [[sheep]] and [[fish]] in the [[sea]].&lt;ref name="Taylor1961"/&gt; In these papers the ''b'' value lay between 1 and 3. Taylor proposed the power law as a general feature of the spatial distribution of these species. He also proposed a mechanistic hypothesis to explain this law. Among the papers cited were those of Bliss and Yates and Finney.

Initial attempts to explain the spatial distribution of animals had been based on approaches like [[M. S. Bartlet|Bartlett's]] stochastic population models and the [[negative binomial distribution]] that could result from [[birth-death process]]es.&lt;ref name=Taylor1984&gt;Taylor LR (1984) Anscombe’s hypothesis and the changing distributions of insect populations. ''Antenna'' 8, 62–67&lt;/ref&gt;  Taylor's novel explanation was based the assumption of a balanced migratory and congregatory behavior of animals.&lt;ref name="Taylor1961"/&gt;  His hypothesis was initially qualitative, but as it evolved it became semi-quantitative and was supported by simulations.&lt;ref name=Taylor1977&gt;Taylor LR &amp; Taylor RAJ (1977) Aggregation, migration and population mechanics. ''Nature'' 265, 415–421&lt;/ref&gt;  In proposing that animal behavior was the principal mechanism behind the clustering of organisms, Taylor though appeared to have ignored his own report of clustering seen with tobacco necrosis virus plaques.&lt;ref name="Taylor1961"/&gt;

Following Taylor's initial publications several alternative hypotheses for the power law were advanced. Hanski proposed a random walk model, modulated by the presumed multiplicative effect of reproduction.&lt;ref name=Hanski1980&gt;Hanski I (1980) Spatial patterns and movements in coprophagous beetles. ''Oikos'' 34, 293–310&lt;/ref&gt; Hanski's model predicted that the power law exponent would be constrained to range closely about the value of 2, which seemed inconsistent with many reported values.&lt;ref name=Taylor1980 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor1982"/&gt;

Anderson ''et al'' formulated a simple stochastic birth, death, immigration and emigration model that yielded a quadratic variance function.&lt;ref name=Anderson1961&gt;Anderson RD, Crawley GM &amp; Hassell M (1982) Variability in the abundance of animal and plant species. ''Nature'' 296, 245–248&lt;/ref&gt; As a response to this model Taylor argued that such a [[Markov process]] would predict that the power law exponent would vary considerably between replicate observations, and that such variability had not been observed.&lt;ref name=Taylor1983&gt;Taylor LR, Taylor RAJ, Woiwod IP &amp; Perry JN (1983) Behavioural dynamics. ''Nature'' 303, 801–804&lt;/ref&gt;

About this time concerns were, however, raised regarding the statistical variability with measurements of the power law exponent, and the possibility that observations of a power law might reflect more mathematical artifact than a mechanistic process.&lt;ref name=Downing1986&gt;Downing JA (1986) Spatial heterogeneity: evolved behaviour or mathematical artefact? ''Nature'' 323, 255–257&lt;/ref&gt;  Taylor ''et al'' responded with an additional publication of extensive observations which he claimed refuted Downing's concerns.&lt;ref name=Taylor1988&gt;Taylor LR (1988) Specificity of the spatial power-law exponent in ecology and agriculture. ''Nature'' 332, 721–722&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Thórarinsson published a detailed critique of the animal behavioral model, noting that Taylor had modified his model several times in response to concerns raised, and that some of these modifications were inconsistent with earlier versions.&lt;ref name="Thórarinsson1986"&gt; Thórarinsson K (1986) Population density and movement: a critique of Δ-models. ''Oikos'' 189, 70–81&lt;/ref&gt; Thórarinsson also claimed that Taylor confounded animal numbers with density and that Taylor had incorrectly interpreted simulations that had been constructed to demonstrate his models as validation.

Kemp reviewed a number of discrete stochastic models based on the negative binomial, Neyman type A, and Polya–Aeppli distributions that with suitable adjustment of parameters could produce a variance to mean power law.&lt;ref name=Kemp1987&gt;Kemp AW (1987) Families of discrete distributions satisfying Taylor’s power law. ''Biometrics'' 43, 693–699&lt;/ref&gt;  Kemp, however, did not explain the parameterizations of his models in mechanistic terms.  Other relatively abstract models for Taylor's law followed.&lt;ref name="Kendal1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yamamura1990&gt;Yamamura K (1990) Sampling scale dependence of Taylor’s power law. ''Oikos'' 59, 121–125&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of additional statistical concerns were raised regarding Taylor's law, based on the difficulty with real data in distinguishing between Taylor's law and other variance to mean functions, as well the inaccuracy of standard regression methods.&lt;ref name=Routledge1991&gt;Routledge RD &amp; Swartz TB (1991) Taylor’s power law re-examined. ''Oikos'' 60, 107–112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tokeshi1995&gt;Tokeshi M (1995) On the mathematical basis of the variance–mean power relationship. ''Res Pop Ecol'' 37, 43–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports also began to accumulate where Taylor's law had been applied to time series data. Perry showed how simulations based on [[chaos theory]] could yield Taylor's law, and Kilpatrick &amp; Ives provided simulations which showed how interactions between different species might lead to Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Perry1994&gt;Perry JN (1994) Chaotic dynamics can generate Taylor’s power law. ''Proc Roy Soc Lond Ser B Biol Sci'' 257, 221–226&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kilpatrick2003&gt;Kilpatrick AM &amp; Ives AR (2003) Species interactions can explain Taylor’s power law for ecological time series. ''Nature'' 422, 65–68&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reports appeared where Taylor's law had been applied to the spatial distribution of plants&lt;ref name=Clark1996&gt;Clark S, Perry JJN &amp; Marshall JP (1996) Estimating Taylor’s power law parameters for weeds and the effect of spatial scale. ''Weed Res'' 36, 405–417&lt;/ref&gt; and bacterial populations&lt;ref name=Ramsayer2011&gt;Ramsayer J, Fellous S, Cohen JE &amp; Hochberg ME (2011) Taylor's Law holds in experimental bacterial populations but competition does not influence the slope. ''Biology Letters''&lt;/ref&gt;  As with the observations of Tobacco necrosis virus mentioned earlier, these observations were not consistent with Taylor's animal behavioral model.

Earlier it was mentioned that variance to mean power function had been applied to non-ecological systems, under the rubric of Taylor's law.  To provide a more general explanation for the range of manifestations of the power law a hypothesis was proposed based on the [[Tweedie distributions]],&lt;ref name="Jørgensen-1997"&gt;{{cite book       | author = Jørgensen, Bent | year = 1997| title = The theory of dispersion models | publisher = [Chapman &amp; Hall] | isbn = 978-0412997112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a family of probabilistic models that express an inherent power function relationship between the variance and the mean.&lt;ref name=Kendal2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kendal2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kendal2002&gt;Kendal WS (2002) Spatial aggregation of the Colorado potato beetle described by an exponential dispersion model. ''Ecol Model'' 151, 261–269&lt;/ref&gt;  Details regarding this hypothesis will be provided in the next section.

A further alternative explanation for Taylor's law was proposed by [[Joel E. Cohen|Cohen]] ''et al'', derived from the [[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin]] Cohen [[Population dynamics|growth model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=J E |author2=Xu, m |author3=Schuster, W S|title=Stochastic multiplicative population growth predicts and interprets Taylor's power law of fluctuation scaling|journal=Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci|year=2013|volume=280|page=20122955}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model was successfully used to describe the spatial and temporal variability of forest populations.

Another paper by Cohen and Xu that random sampling in blocks where the underling distribution is skewed with the first four moments finite gives rise to Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Cohen2015&gt;Cohen JE, Xu M (2015) Random sampling of skewed distributions implies Taylor's power law of fluctuation scaling. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 112(25):7749–7754. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1503824112&lt;/ref&gt; Approximate formulae for the parameters and their variances were also derived. These estimates were tested again data from the Black Rock Forest and found to be in reasonable agreement.

Following Taylor's initial publications several alternative hypotheses for the power law were advanced. Hanski proposed a random walk model, modulated by the presumed multiplicative effect of reproduction.&lt;ref name=Hanski1980&gt;Hanski I (1980) Spatial patterns and movements in coprophagous beetles. ''Oikos'' 34, 293–310&lt;/ref&gt; Hanski's model predicted that the power law exponent would be constrained to range closely about the value of 2, which seemed inconsistent with many reported values.&lt;ref name=Taylor1980 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor1982"/&gt; Anderson ''et al'' formulated a simple stochastic birth, death, immigration and emigration model that yielded a quadratic variance function.&lt;ref name=Anderson1961&gt;Anderson RD, Crawley GM &amp; Hassell M (1982) Variability in the abundance of animal and plant species. ''Nature'' 296, 245–248&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin]] Cohen [[Population dynamics|growth model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=J E |author2=Xu, m |author3=Schuster, W S|title=Stochastic multiplicative population growth predicts and interprets Taylor's power law of fluctuation scaling|journal=Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci|year=2013|volume=280|page=20122955}}&lt;/ref&gt; is another proposed explanation. The possibility that observations of a power law might reflect more mathematical artifact than a mechanistic process was raised.&lt;ref name=Downing1986&gt;Downing JA (1986) Spatial heterogeneity: evolved behaviour or mathematical artefact? ''Nature'' 323, 255–257&lt;/ref&gt;



===Physics===

In the physics literature Taylor's law has been referred to as ''fluctuation scaling''. Eisler ''et al'', in a further attempt to find a general explanation for fluctuation scaling, proposed a process they called ''impact inhomogeneity'' in which frequent events are associated with larger impacts.&lt;ref name=Eisler2008&gt;Eisler Z, Bartos I &amp; Kertesz (2008) Fluctuation scaling in complex systems: Taylor’s law and beyond. ''Adv Phys'' 57, 89–142&lt;/ref&gt; In appendix B of the Eisler article, however, the authors noted that the equations for impact inhomogeneity yielded the same mathematical relationships as found with the Tweedie distributions.

Another group of physicists, Fronczak and Fronczak, derived Taylor's power law for fluctuation scaling from principles of equilibrium and non-equilibrium [[statistical physics]].&lt;ref name=Fronczak2010&gt;Fronczak A &amp; Fronczak P (2010) Origins of Taylor’s power law for fluctuation scaling in complex systems. ''Phys Rev E'' 81, 066112&lt;/ref&gt; Their derivation was based on assumptions of physical quantities like [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] and an external [[field (physics)|field]] that caused the clustering of biological organisms. Direct experimental demonstration of these postulated physical quantities in relationship to animal or plant aggregation has yet to be achieved, though. Shortly thereafter, an analysis of Fronczak and Fronczak's model was presented that showed their equations directly lead to the Tweedie distributions, a finding that suggested that Fronczak and Fronczak had possibly provided a [[maximum entropy probability distribution|maximum entropy]] derivation of these distributions.&lt;ref name="Kendal2011a"/&gt;

===Mathematics===

Taylor's law has been shown to hold for [[prime number]]s not exceeding a given real number.&lt;ref name=Cohen2016&gt;Cohen JE (2016) Statistics of primes (and probably twin primes) satisfy Taylor's Law from ecology. The American Statistician 70 (4) 399–404&lt;/ref&gt; This result has been shown to hold for the first 11 million primes. If the [[Twin prime|Hardy–Littlewood twin primes conjecture]] is true then this law also holds for twin primes.

===Naming of law===

The law itself is named after the ecologist [[Roy Taylor (ecologist)|Lionel Roy Taylor]] (1924–2007). The name 'Taylor's law' was coined by Southwood in 1966.&lt;ref name=Southwood1966/&gt; Taylor's original name for this relationship was the law of the mean

==The Tweedie Hypothesis==

About the time that Taylor was substantiating his ecological observations, [[Maurice Tweedie|MCK Tweedie]], a British statistician and medical physicist, was investigating a family of probabilistic models that are now known as the [[Tweedie distributions]].&lt;ref name=Tweedie1984&gt;Tweedie MCK (1984) An index which distinguishes between some important exponential families. In: ''Statistics: Applications and New Directions Proceedings of the Indian Statistical Institute Golden Jubilee International Conference'' pp 579-604 Eds: JK Ghosh &amp; J Roy, Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1987"&gt;Jørgensen B (1987)Exponential dispersion models. ''J Roy Stat Soc Ser B'' 49, 127–162}&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned above, these distributions are all characterized by a variance to mean power law mathematically identical to Taylor's law.

The Tweedie distribution most applicable to ecological observations is the [[compound Poisson distribution|compound Poisson-gamma distribution]], which represents the sum of ''N'' independent and identically distributed random variables with a gamma distribution where ''N'' is a random variable distributed in accordance with a Poisson distribution. In the additive form its [[cumulant|cumulant generating function]] (CGF) is:

: &lt;math&gt;K^*_b(s;\theta,\lambda)=\lambda\kappa_b(\theta)\left [\left(1+{s \over \theta}\right)^\alpha-1\right]&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''κ''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;(''θ'') is the cumulant function,

: &lt;math&gt;\kappa_b(\theta)={(\alpha-1)\over \alpha}\left({\theta \over (\alpha-1)}\right)^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;,

the Tweedie exponent

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha=(b-2)/(b-1)&lt;/math&gt;,

''s'' is the generating function variable, and ''θ'' and ''λ'' are the canonical and index parameters, respectively.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen-1997"/&gt;

These last two parameters are analogous to the [[scale parameter|scale]] and [[shape parameter]]s used in probability theory. The [[cumulant]]s of this distribution can be determined by successive differentiations of the CGF and then substituting ''s=0'' into the resultant equations. The first and second cumulants are the mean and variance, respectively, and thus the compound Poisson-gamma CGF yields Taylor's law with the proportionality constant

: &lt;math&gt;a=\lambda^{1/(\alpha-1)}&lt;/math&gt;.

The compound Poisson-gamma cumulative distribution function has been verified for limited ecological data through the comparison of the theoretical distribution function with the empirical distribution function.&lt;ref name=Kendal2002 /&gt; A number of other systems, demonstrating variance to mean power laws related to Taylor's law, have been similarly tested for the compound Poisson-gamma distribution.&lt;ref name=Kendal2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kendal2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kendal2011a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kendal2011b"/&gt;

The main justification for the Tweedie hypothesis rests with the mathematical [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence]] properties of the Tweedie distributions.&lt;ref name=Kendal2004 /&gt; The [[Tweedie distributions|'''Tweedie convergence theorem''']] requires the Tweedie distributions to act as foci of convergence for a wide range of statistical processes.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1994"&gt;Jørgensen B, Marinez JR &amp; Tsao M (1994) Asymptotic behaviour of the variance function. ''Scandinavian Journal of Statistics'' 21, 223–243&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of this convergence theorem, processes based on the sum of multiple independent small jumps will tend to express Taylor's law and obey a Tweedie distribution. A limit theorem for independent and identically distributed variables, as with the Tweedie convergence theorem, might then be considered as being fundamental relative to the ''ad hoc'' population models, or models proposed on the basis of simulation or approximation.&lt;ref name="Kendal2011a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kendal2011b"/&gt;

This hypothesis remains controversial; more conventional [[Population dynamics|population dynamic]] approaches seem preferred amongst ecologists, despite the fact that the Tweedie compound Poisson distribution can be directly applied to population dynamic mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Kendal1995/&gt;

One difficulty with the Tweedie hypothesis is that the value of ''b'' does not range between 0 and 1. Values of ''b'' &lt; 1 are rare but have been reported.&lt;ref name=Wilson1982&gt;Wilson LT &amp; Room PM (1982) The relative efficiency and reliability of three methods for sampling arthropods in Australian cotton fields. J Aust Entomol Soc 21: 175-181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical formulation==

In symbols

: &lt;math&gt; s_i^2 = am_i^b &lt;/math&gt;,

where ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[variance]] of the density of the ''i''th sample, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[mean]] density of the ''i''th sample and ''a'' and ''b'' are constants.

In logarithmic form

: &lt;math&gt; \log s_i^2 = \log a + b\log m_i &lt;/math&gt;

===Scale invariance===

Taylor's law is scale invariant. If the unit of measurement is changed by a constant factor ''c'', the exponent (''b'') remains unchanged.

To see this let ''y'' = ''cx''. Then

&lt;math&gt; \mu_1 = \mathbb{E}( x ) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \mu_2 = \mathbb{E}( y ) =\mathbb{E}( c\,x ) = c \, \mathbb{E}( x ) = c\, \mu_1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \sigma^2_1 = \mathbb{E} ( x - \mu_1 )^2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \sigma^2_2 = \mathbb{E}( y - \mu_2 )^2 = \mathbb{E}( c\,x - c\, \mu_1 )^2 = c^2 \mathbb{E} ( x - \mu_1 )^2 = c^2\, \sigma^2_1 &lt;/math&gt;

Taylor's law expressed in the original variable (''x'') is

&lt;math&gt; \sigma_1^2 = a \mu_1^b &lt;/math&gt;

and in the rescaled variable (''y'') it is

&lt;math&gt; \sigma_2^2 = a \mu_2^b = c^2 \sigma_1^2 = c^2 a \mu_1^b &lt;/math&gt;

It has been shown that Taylor's law is the only relationship between the mean and variance that is scale invariant.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1997"&gt;Jørgensen B (1997) The theory of exponential dispersion models. Chapman &amp; Hall. London&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extensions and refinements===

A refinement in the estimation of the slope ''b'' has been proposed by Rayner.&lt;ref name=Rayner1985&gt;Rayner JMV (1985) Linear relations in biomechanics: the statistics of scaling functions. J Zoo 206 (3) 415–439&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; b = \frac { f - \varphi + \sqrt{ ( f - \varphi )^2 - 4 r^2 f \varphi } }{ 2 r \sqrt{ f } } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' is the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson moment correlation coefficient]] between log(''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and log&amp;nbsp;''m'', ''f'' is the ratio of sample variances in log(''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and log&amp;nbsp;''m'' and ''φ'' is the ratio of the errors in log(''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''m''.

Ordinary least squares regression assumes that&amp;nbsp;''φ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∞. This tends to underestimate the value of ''b'' because the estimates of both log(''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and log&amp;nbsp;''m'' are subject to error.

An extension of Taylor's law has been proposed by Ferris ''et al'' when multiple samples are taken&lt;ref name=Ferris1990&gt;Ferris H, Mullens TA, Foord KE (1990) Stability and characteristics of spatial description parameters for nematode populations. J Nematol 22(4):427-439&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = ( c n^d ) ( m^b ) &lt;/math&gt;,

where ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''m'' are the variance and mean respectively, ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' are constants and ''n'' is the number of samples taken. To date, this proposed extension has not been verified to be as applicable as the original version of Taylor's law.

===Small samples===

An extension to this law for small samples has been proposed by Hanski.&lt;ref name=Hanski1982&gt;Hanski I(1982) On patterns of temporal and spatial variation in animal populations. Ann. zool. Fermici 19: 21—37&lt;/ref&gt; For small samples the Poisson variation (''P'') - the variation that can be ascribed to sampling variation - may be significant. Let ''S'' be the total variance and let ''V'' be the biological (real) variance. Then

: &lt;math&gt; S = V + P &lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the validity of Taylor's law, we have

: &lt;math&gt; V = a m^b &lt;/math&gt;

Because in the Poisson distribution the mean equals the variance, we have

: &lt;math&gt; P = m &lt;/math&gt;

This gives us

: &lt;math&gt; S = V + P = a m^b + m &lt;/math&gt;

This closely resembles Barlett's original suggestion.

===Interpretation===

Slope values (''b'') significantly &gt;&amp;nbsp;1 indicate clumping of the organisms.

In [[Poisson distribution|Poisson-distributed]] data, ''b'' = 1.&lt;ref name=Taylor1983/&gt; If the population follows a [[lognormal distribution|lognormal]] or [[gamma distribution]], then&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.

For populations that are experiencing constant per capita environmental variability, the regression of log( variance ) versus log( mean abundance ) should have a line with ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.

Most populations that have been studied have ''b''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2 (usually 1.5–1.6) but values of 2 have been reported.&lt;ref name=Boag1992&gt;Boag B, Hackett CA, Topham PB (1992) The use of Taylor's power law to describe the aggregated distribution of gastro-intestinal nematodes of sheep. Int J Parasitol 22(3):267–270&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally cases with ''b'' &gt; 2 have been reported.&lt;ref name=Taylor1980 /&gt; ''b'' values below 1 are uncommon but have also been reported ( ''b'' = 0.93 ).&lt;ref name="Wilson1982"/&gt;

It has been suggested that the exponent of the law (''b'') is proportional to the skewness of the underlying distribution.&lt;ref name=v2015&gt;Cohen J E, Xua M (2015) Random sampling of skewed distributions implies Taylor’s power law of fluctuation scaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2015 112 (25) 7749–7754&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal has criticised: additional work seems to be indicated.&lt;ref name=Anon2015a&gt;Reply to Chen: Under specified assumptions, adequate random samples of skewed distributions obey Taylor's law (2015) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 112 (25) E3157-E3158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anon2015b&gt;Random sampling of skewed distributions does not necessarily imply Taylor's law (2015) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 112 (25) E3156&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notes===

The origin of the slope (''b'') in this regression remains unclear. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain it. One suggests that ''b'' arises from the species behavior and is a constant for that species. The alternative suggests that it is dependent on the sampled population. Despite the considerable number of studies carried out on this law (over 1000), this question remains open.

It is known that both ''a'' and ''b'' are subject to change due to age-specific dispersal, mortality and sample unit size.&lt;ref name=Banerjee1976&gt;Banerjee B (1976) Variance to mean ratio and the spatial distribution of animals. Experientia 32: 993-994&lt;/ref&gt;

This law may be a poor fit if the values are small. For this reason an extension to Taylor's law has been proposed by [[Ilkka Hanski|Hanski]] which improves the fit of Taylor's law at low densities.&lt;ref name=Hanski1982 /&gt;

===Extension to cluster sampling of binary data===

A form of Taylor's law applicable to binary data in clusters (e.q., quadrats) has been proposed.&lt;ref name=Hughes&amp;Madden1992&gt;Hughes G, and Madden LV (1992) Aggregation and incidence of disease. Plant Pathology 41(6):657–660&lt;/ref&gt; In a binomial distribution, the theoretical variance is

: &lt;math&gt; var_{ bin } = n p ( 1 - p ) &lt;/math&gt;,

where ''(var&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt;)'' is the binomial variance, ''n'' is the sample size per cluster, and ''p'' is the proportion of individuals with a trait (such as disease), an estimate of the probability of an individual having that trait.

One difficulty with binary data is that the mean and variance, in general, have a particular relationship: as the mean proportion of individuals infected increases above 0.5, the variance deceases.

It is now known that the observed variance ''(var&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt;)'' changes as a power function of ''(var&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt;)''.&lt;ref name="Hughes&amp;Madden1992"/&gt;

Hughes and Madden noted that if the distribution is Poisson, the mean and variance are equal.&lt;ref name="Hughes&amp;Madden1992"/&gt; As this is clearly not the case in many observed proportion samples, they instead assumed a binomial distribution. They replaced the mean in Taylor's law with the binomial variance and then compared this theoretical variance with the observed variance. For binomial data, they showed that ''var&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt; = var&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt;'' with overdispersion, ''var&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; ''var&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt;''.

In symbols, Hughes and Madden's modification to Tyalor's law was

: &lt;math&gt; var_{ obs } = a( var_{ bin } )^b &lt;/math&gt;.

In logarithmic form this relationship is

: &lt;math&gt; \log( var_{ obs } ) = \log( a ) + b \log( var_{ bin } ) &lt;/math&gt;.

This latter version is known as the binary power law.

A key step in the derivation of the binary power law by Hughes and Madden was the observation made by Patil and Stiteler&lt;ref name=Patil&amp;Stiteler1974&gt;Patil GP, and Stiteler WM (1974) Concepts of aggregation and their quantification: a critical review with some new results and applications. Researches on Population Ecology 15:238-254&lt;/ref&gt; that the variance-to-mean ratio used for assessing over-dispersion of unbounded counts in a single sample is actually the ratio of two variances: the observed variance and the theoretical variance for a random distribution. For unbounded counts, the random distribution is the Poisson. Thus, the Taylor power law for a collection of samples can be considered as a relationship between the observed variance and the Poisson variance.

More broadly, Madden and Hughes&lt;ref name="Hughes&amp;Madden1992"/&gt; considered the power law as the relationship between two variances, the observed variance and the theoretical variance for a random distribution. With binary data, the random distribution is the binomial (not the Poisson). Thus the Taylor power law and the binary power law are two special cases of a general power-law relationships for heterogeneity.

When both ''a'' and ''b'' are equal to 1, then a small-scale random spatial pattern is suggested and is best described by the binomial distribution. When ''b'' = 1 and ''a'' &gt; 1, there is over-dispersion (small scale aggregation). When ''b'' is &gt; 1, the degree of aggregation varies with ''p''. Turechek ''et al''&lt;ref name="Turechek et al.2011"&gt;Turechek WW, Madden LV, Gent DH, Xu XM (2011) Comments regarding the binary power law for heterogeneity of disease incidence. Phytopathology 101(12):1396-1407&lt;/ref&gt; have showed that the binary power law describes numerous data sets in plant pathology. In general, ''b'' is greater than 1 and less than 2.

The fit of this law has been tested by simulations.&lt;ref name=Gosme2009&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Marie|last1=Gosme|first2=Philippe|last2=Lucas|title=Disease Spread Across Multiple Scales in a Spatial Hierarchy: Effect of Host Spatial Structure and of Inoculum Quantity and Distribution|url=http://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PHYTO-99-7-0833|journal=Phytopathology|date=2009-06-12|issn=0031-949X|pages=833–839|volume=99|issue=7|doi=10.1094/phyto-99-7-0833|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results suggest that rather than a single regression line for the data set, a segmental regression may be a better model for genuinely random distributions. However, this segmentation only occurs for very short-range dispersal distances and large quadrat sizes.&lt;ref name="Turechek et al.2011"/&gt; The break in the line occurs only at ''p'' very close to 0.

An extension to this law has been proposed.&lt;ref name=Xu2014&gt;Xu X-M, Madden LV (2013) The limits of the binary power law describing spatial variability for incidence data. Plant Pathology 63 (5) 973–982&lt;/ref&gt; The original form of this law is symmetrical but it can be extended to an asymmetrical form.&lt;ref name="Xu2014"/&gt; Using simulations the symmetrical form fits the data when there is positive correlation of disease status of neighbors. Where there is a negative correlation between the likelihood of neighbours being infected, the asymmetrical version is a better fit to the data.

==Applications==

Because of the ubiquitous occurrence of Taylor's law in biology it has found a variety of uses some of which are listed here.

===Recommendations as to use===

It has been recommended based on simulation studies&lt;ref name=Clark1994&gt;Clark SJ &amp; Perry JN (1994) Small sample estimation for Taylor's power law. Environment Ecol Stats 1 (4) 287–302, {{doi|10.1007/BF00469426}}&lt;/ref&gt; in applications testing the validity of Taylor's law to a data sample that:

(1) the total number of organisms studied be &gt; 15&lt;br/&gt;
(2) the minimum number of groups of organisms studied be &gt; 5&lt;br/&gt; 
(3) the density of the organisms should vary by at least 2 orders of magnitude within the sample

===Randomly distributed populations===

It is common assumed (at least initially) that a population is randomly distributed in the environment. If a population is randomly distributed then the mean ( ''m'' ) and variance ( ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ) of the population are equal and the proportion of samples that contain at least one individual ( ''p'' ) is

: &lt;math&gt; p = 1 - e^{ -m } &lt;/math&gt;

When a species with a clumped pattern is compared with one that is randomly distributed with equal overall densities, p will be less for the species having the clumped distribution pattern. Conversely when comparing a uniformly and a randomly distributed species but at equal overall densities, ''p'' will be greater for the randomly distributed population. This can be graphically tested by plotting ''p'' against ''m''.

Wilson and Room developed a binomial model that incorporates Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Wison1983&gt;Wilson LT &amp; Room PM (1983) Clumping patterns of fruit and arthropods in cotton with implications for binomial sampling. Environ Entomol 12:50-54&lt;/ref&gt; The basic relationship is

: &lt;math&gt; p = 1 - e^{ - m \log( s^2 / m )( s^2 / m - 1 )^{ -1 } } &lt;/math&gt;

where the log is taken to the base ''e''.

Incorporating Taylor's law this relationship becomes

: &lt;math&gt; p = 1 - e^{ - m \log( a m^{ b - 1 } )( a m^{ b - 1 } - 1 )^{ -1 } } &lt;/math&gt;

===Dispersion parameter estimator===

The common dispersion parameter (''k'') of the negative binomial distribution is

: &lt;math&gt; k = m^2 / ( s^2 - m ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the sample mean and ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance.&lt;ref name=Bliss1953&gt;Bliss CI and Fisher RA (1953) Fitting the negative binomial distribution to biological data (also includes note on the efficient fitting of the negative binomial). Biometrics 9: 177-200&lt;/ref&gt; If 1 / ''k'' is &gt; 0 the population is considered to be aggregated; 1 / ''k'' = 0 ( ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''m'' ) the population is considered to be randomly (Poisson) distributed and if 1 / ''k'' is &lt; 0 the population is considered to be uniformly distributed. No comment on the distribution can be made if ''k'' = 0.

Wilson and Room assuming that Taylor's law applied to the population gave an alternative estimator for ''k'':&lt;ref name="Wison1983"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; k = \frac { m } { a m^{ b - 1 } - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' are the constants from Taylor's law.

Jones&lt;ref name=Jones1991&gt;Jones VP (1991) Binomial sampling plans for tentiform leafminer (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) on apple in Utah. J Econ Entomol 84: 484-488&lt;/ref&gt; using the estimate for ''k'' above along with the relationship Wilson and Room developed for the probability of finding a sample having at least one individual&lt;ref name="Wison1983"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; p = 1 - e^{ - m \log( a m^{ b - 1 } )( a m^{ b - 1 } - 1 )^{ -1 } } &lt;/math&gt;

derived an estimator for the probability of a sample containing ''x'' individuals per sampling unit. Jones's formula is

: &lt;math&gt; P( x ) = P( x - 1 ) \frac { k + x - 1 } { x } \frac { m k^{ -1 } } { m k^{ -1 } - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''P''( ''x'' ) is the probability of finding ''x'' individuals per sampling unit, ''k'' is estimated from the Wilon and Room equation and ''m'' is the sample mean. The probability of finding zero individuals ''P''( 0 ) is estimated with the [[negative binomial distribution]]

: &lt;math&gt; P( 0 ) = ( 1 + m / k )^{ -k } &lt;/math&gt;

Jones also gives confidence intervals for these probabilities.

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ CI } = t \left( \frac { P( x ) ( 1 - P( x ) ) } { N } \right)^{ 1 / 2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''CI'' is the confidence interval, ''t'' is the critical value taken from the t distribution and ''N'' is the total sample size.

===Katz family of distributions===

Katz proposed a family of distributions (the [[Katz family]]) with 2 parameters ( ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ).&lt;ref name=Katz1965&gt;Katz L (1965) United treatment of a broad class of discrete probability distributions. ''in'' Proceedings of the International Symposium on Discrete Distributions. Montreal&lt;/ref&gt; This family of distributions includes the [[Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli]], [[Geometric distribution|Geometric]], [[Pascal distribution|Pascal]] and Poisson distributions as special cases. The mean and variance of a Katz distribution are

: &lt;math&gt; m = \frac { w_1 } { 1 - w_2 } &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = \frac{ w_1 } { ( 1 - w_2 )^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the mean and ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance of the sample. The parameters can be estimated by the method of moments from which we have

: &lt;math&gt; \frac { w_1 } { ( 1 - w_2 ) } = m &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \frac { w_2 } { ( 1 - w_2 ) } = \frac { s^2 - m } { m } &lt;/math&gt;

For a Poisson distribution ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''λ'' the parameter of the Possion distribution. This family of distributions is also sometimes known as the Panjer family of distributions.

The Katz family is related to the Sundt-Jewel family of distributions:&lt;ref name=Jewel1981&gt;Jewel W, Sundt B (1981) Improved approximations for the distribution of a heterogeneous risk portfolio. Bull Assoc Swiss Act 81: 221-240&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; p_n = \left( a + \frac{ b }{ n } \right) p_{ n - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

The only members of the Sundt-Jewel family are the Poisson, binomial, negative binomial (Pascal), [[extended truncated negative binomial]] and [[logarithmic series distribution]]s.

If the population obeys a Katz distribution then the coefficients of Taylor's law are

: &lt;math&gt; a = -\log ( 1 - w_2 ) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; b = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Katz also introduced a statistical test&lt;ref name="Katz1965"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; J_n = \sqrt { \frac { n } { 2 } } \frac { s^2 - m } { m } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''J''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the test statistic, ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance of the sample, ''m'' is the mean of the sample and ''n'' is the sample size. ''J''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is asymptotically normally distributed with a zero mean and unit variance. If the sample is Poisson distributed ''J''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 0; values of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0 and &gt; 0 indicate under and over dispersion respectively. Overdispersion is often caused by latent heterogeneity - the presence of multiple sub populations within the population the sample is drawn from.

This statistic is related to the Neyman-Scott statistic

: &lt;math&gt; NS = \sqrt { \frac { n - 1 } { 2 } } \left( \frac { s^2} { m } - 1 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

which is known to be asymptotically normal and the conditional chi-squared statistic (Poisson dispersion test)

: &lt;math&gt; T = \frac { ( n - 1 ) s^2 } { m } &lt;/math&gt;
 
which is known to have an asymptotic chi squared distribution with ''n'' − 1 degrees of freedom when the population is Poisson distributed.

If the population obeys Taylor's law then

: &lt;math&gt; J_n = \sqrt { \frac { n } { 2 } } ( a m^{ b - 1 } - 1 ) &lt;/math&gt;

===Time to extinction===

If Taylor's law is assumed to apply it is possible to determine the mean time to local extinction. This model assumes a simple random walk in time and the absence of density dependent population regulation.&lt;ref name=Foley1994&gt;Foley P (1994) Predicting extinction times from environmental stochasticity and carrying capacity. Conserv Biol 8: 124-137&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt; N_{ t + 1 } = r N_{ t } &lt;/math&gt; where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;t+1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; are the population sizes at time ''t'' + 1 and ''t'' respectively and ''r'' is parameter equal to the annual increase (decrease in population). Then

: &lt;math&gt; var(r) = s^2 ( \log( r ) ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''var''( ''r'' ) is the variance of ''r''.

Let ''K'' be a measure of the species abundance (organisms per unit area). Then

: &lt;math&gt; T_E = \frac{ 2\log( N ) } { Var( r ) } ( \log( K ) - \frac{ \log( N ) } { 2 }) &lt;/math&gt;

where T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; is the mean time to local extinction.

The probability of extinction by time ''t'' is

: &lt;math&gt; P( t ) = 1 - e^{ \frac{ t } { T_E } } &lt;/math&gt;

===Minimum population size required to avoid extinction===

If a population is [[lognormal distribution|lognormally distributed]] then the [[harmonic mean]] of the population size (''H'') is related to the [[arithmetic mean]] (''m'')&lt;ref name=Pertoldi2008&gt;Pertoldi C, Bach LA, Loeschcke V (2008) On the brink between extinction and persistence. Biol Direct 3: 47 doi: 10.1186/1745-6150-3-47&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; H = m - am^{ ( b - 1 ) } &lt;/math&gt;

Given that ''H'' must be &gt; 0 for the population to persist then rearranging we have

: &lt;math&gt; m &gt; a^{ \frac{ 1 }{ 2 - b } } &lt;/math&gt;

is the minimum size of population for the species to persist.

The assumption of a lognormal distribution appears to apply to about half of a sample of 544 species.&lt;ref name=Halley2002&gt;Halley J, Inchausti P (2002) Lognormality in ecological time series. Oikos 99:518–530. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.11962.x&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that it is at least a plausible assumption.

===Sampling size estimators===

The degree of precision (''D'') is defined to be ''s'' / ''m'' where ''s'' is the [[standard deviation]] and ''m'' is the mean. The degree of precision is known as the [[coefficient of variation]] in other contexts. In ecology research it is recommended that ''D'' be in the range 10-25%.&lt;ref name=Southwood2000&gt;Southwood TRE &amp; Henderson PA (2000) Ecological methods. 3rd ed. Blackwood, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; The desired degree of precision is important in estimating the required sample size where an investigator wishes to test if Taylor's law applies to the data. The required sample size has been estimated for a number of simple distributions but where the population distribution is not known or cannot be assumed more complex formulae may needed to determine the required sample size.

Where the population is Poisson distributed the sample size (''n'') needed is

: &lt;math&gt; n = ( t / D )^2 / m &lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is critical level of the [[Student's t-distribution|t distribution]] for the type 1 error with the [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] that the mean (''m'') was calculated with.

If the population is distributed as a [[negative binomial distribution]] then the required sample size is

: &lt;math&gt; n = ( t / D )^2 ( m + k ) / ( mk ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is the parameter of the negative binomial distribution.

A more general sample size estimator has also been proposed&lt;ref name=Service1971&gt;Service MW (1971) Studies on sampling larval populations of the ''Anopheles gambiae'' complex. Bull World Health Organ 45: 169-180&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; n = ( t / D )^2 a m^{( b - 2 )} &lt;/math&gt;

where a and b are derived from Taylor's law.

An alternative has been proposed by Southwood&lt;ref name=Southwood1978&gt;Southwood TRE (1978) Ecological methods. Chapman &amp; Hall, London, England&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; n = a m^b / D^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the required sample size, ''a'' and ''b'' are the Taylor's law coefficients and ''D'' is the desired degree of precision.

Karandinos proposed two similar estimators for ''n''.&lt;ref name=Karandinos1976&gt;Karandinos MG (1976) Optimum sample size and comments on some published formulae. Bull Entomol Soc Am 22:417-421&lt;/ref&gt; The first was modified by Ruesink to incorporate Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Ruesink1980&gt;Ruesink WG (1980) Introduction to sampling theory, in Kogan M &amp; Herzog DC (eds.) Sampling Methods in Soybean Entomology. Springer-Verlag New York, Inc, New York. pp 61-78&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; n = ( t / d_m )^2 a m^{( b - 2 )} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' is the ratio of half the desired confidence interval (''CI'') to the mean. In symbols

: &lt;math&gt; d_m = \frac { CI } { 2m } &lt;/math&gt;

The second estimator is used in binomial (presence-absence) sampling. The desired sample size (''n'') is

&lt;math&gt; n = ( t / d_p )^2 p^{ -1 } q &lt;/math&gt;

where the ''d''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is ratio of half the desired confidence interval to the proportion of sample units with individuals, ''p'' is proportion of samples containing individuals and ''q'' = 1 - ''p''. In symbols

: &lt;math&gt; d_p = \frac { CI } { 2p } &lt;/math&gt;

For binary (presence/absence) sampling, Schulthess ''et al'' modified Karandinos' equation

&lt;math&gt; N = \left( \frac{ t } { D_{ pi } } \right)^2 \frac{ 1 - p }{ p } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the required sample size, ''p'' is the proportion of units containing the organisms of interest, ''t'' is the chosen level of significance and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;ip&lt;/sub&gt; is a parameter derived from Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Schulthess1991&gt;Schulthess F, Bosque-Péreza NA, Gounoua S (1991) Sampling lepidopterous pests on maize in West Africa. Bull Entomol Res 81 (3) 297-301&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sequential sampling===

[[Sequential analysis]] is a method of [[statistical analysis]] where the sample size is not fixed in advance. Instead samples are taken in accordance with a predefined [[stopping rule]]. Taylor's law has been used to derive a number of stopping rules.

A formula for fixed precision in serial sampling to test Taylor's law was derived by Green in 1970.&lt;ref name=Bisseleua2011&gt;Bisseleua DHB, Yede, &amp; Vida S (2011) Dispersion models and sampling of cacao mirid bug ''Sahlbergella singularis'' (Hemiptera: Miridae) on theobroma cacao in southern Cameroon. Environ Entomol 40(1): 111-119&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \log T = \frac{\log ( D^2 ) - a }{ b - 2 } + (\log n) \frac{ b - 1 }{ b - 2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is the cumulative sample total, ''D'' is the level of precision, ''n'' is the sample size and ''a'' and ''b'' are obtained from Taylor's law.

As an aid to pest control Wilson ''et al'' developed a test that incorporated a threshold level where action should be taken.&lt;ref name=Wilson1985&gt;Wilson LT, Gonzalez D &amp; Plant RE(1985) Predicting sampling frequency and economic status of spider mites on cotton. Proc. Beltwide Cotton Prod Res Conf, National Cotton Council of America, Memphis, TN pp 168-170&lt;/ref&gt; The required sample size is

: &lt;math&gt; n = t | m - T |^{ - 2} a m^b &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' are the Taylor coefficients, || is the [[absolute value]], ''m'' is the sample mean, ''T'' is the threshold level and ''t'' is the critical level of the t distribution. The authors also provided a similar test for binomial (presence-absence) sampling

: &lt;math&gt; n = t | m - T |^{ -2 } p q &lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'' is the probability of finding a sample with pests present and ''q'' = 1 - ''p''.

Green derived another sampling formula for sequential sampling based on Taylor's law&lt;ref name=Green1970&gt;Green RH (1970) On fixed precision level sequential sampling. Res Pop Ecol 12 (2) 249-251 {{doi|10.1007/BF02511568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; D = ( a n^{ 1 - b } T^{ b - 2 } )^ { 1 / 2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''D'' is the degree of precision, ''a'' and ''b'' are the Taylor's law coefficients, ''n'' is the sample size and ''T'' is the total number of individuals sampled.

Serra ''et al'' have proposed a stopping rule based on Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Serraa2012&gt;Serraa GV, La Porta NC, Avalos S, Mazzuferi V (2012) Fixed-precision sequential sampling plans for estimating alfalfa caterpillar, ''Colias lesbia'', egg density in alfalfa, ''Medicago sativa'', fields in Córdoba, Argentina. J Insect Sci 13: 41&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; T_n \ge \left( \frac{ a n^{ 1 - b } }{ D^2 } \right)^{ \frac{ 1 } { 2 - b } } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' are the parameters from Taylor's law, ''D'' is the desired level of precision and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the total sample size.

Serra ''et al'' also proposed a second stopping rule based on Iwoa's regression

&lt;math&gt; T_n \ge \frac{ \alpha - 1 }{ D^2 - \frac{ \beta - 1 }{ n } }&lt;/math&gt;

where ''α'' and ''β'' are the parameters of the regression line, ''D'' is the desired level of precision and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the total sample size.

The authors recommended that ''D'' be set at 0.1 for studies of population dynamics and ''D'' = 0.25 for pest control.

==Related analyses==

It is considered to be good practice to estimate at least one additional analysis of aggregation (other than Taylor's law) because the use of only a single index may be misleading.&lt;ref name=Myers1978&gt;Myers JH (1978). Selecting a measure of dispersion. Environ Entomol 7: 619–621&lt;/ref&gt; Although a number of other methods for detecting relationships between the variance and mean in biological samples have been proposed, to date none have achieved the popularity of Taylor's law. The most popular analysis used in conjunction with Taylor's law is probably Iowa's Patchiness regression test but all the methods listed here have been used in the literature.

===Barlett–Iawo model===

Barlett in 1936&lt;ref name=Bartlett1936 /&gt; and later Iawo independently in 1968&lt;ref name=Iwao1968a&gt;Iwao S (1968) A new regression method for analyzing the aggregation pattern of animal populations. Res Popul Ecol 10: 1–20&lt;/ref&gt; both proposed an alternative relationship between the variance and the mean. In symbols

: &lt;math&gt; s_i^2 = am_i + bm_i^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' is the variance in the ''i''th sample and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the mean of the ''i''th sample

When the population follows a [[negative binomial distribution]], ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k'' (the exponent of the negative binomial distribution).

This alternative formulation has not been found to be as good a fit as Taylor's law in most studies.

===Nachman model===

Nachman proposed a relationship between the mean density and the proportion of samples with zero counts:&lt;ref name=Nachman1981&gt;Nachman G (1981) A mathematical model of the functional relationship between density and spatial distribution of a population. J Anim Ecol 50: 453–460&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; p_0 = \exp( -a m^b ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the proportion of the sample with zero counts, ''m'' is the mean density, ''a'' is a scale parameter and ''b'' is a dispersion parameter. If ''a'' = ''b'' = 0 the distribution is random. This relationship is usually tested in its logarithmic form

: &lt;math&gt; \log m = c + d \log p_0 &lt;/math&gt;

Allsop used this relationship along with Taylor's law to derive an expression for the proportion of infested units in a sample&lt;ref name=Allsopp1991&gt;Allsopp PG (1991) Binomial sequential sampling of adult ''Saccharicoccus sacchari'' on sugarcane. Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata 60 (3) 213–218&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; P_1 = 1 - \exp\left( -\exp\left( \frac{ \frac{ \log_e \left( \frac{ A^2 } a \right) }{ b - 2 } + \log_e( n )\left( \frac{ b - 1 }{ b - 2 } - 1 \right) - c } d \right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; N = n P_1 &lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt; A^2 = \frac{D^2}{z^2_{\alpha/2}} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the degree of precision desired, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;α/2&lt;/sub&gt; is the upper α/2 of the normal distribution, ''a'' and ''b'' are the Taylor's law coefficients, ''c'' and ''d'' are the Nachman coefficients, ''n'' is the sample size and ''N'' is the number of infested units.

===Kono–Sugino equation===

Binary sampling is not uncommonly used in ecology. In 1958 Kono and Sugino derived an equation that relates the proportion of samples without individuals to the mean density of the samples.&lt;ref name=Kono1958&gt;Kono T &amp; Sugino T (1958) On the estimation of density of rice stem infested by the rice stem borer. Japanese J Appl Entomol and Zool 2: 184&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \log( m ) = \log( a ) + b \log( - \log( p_0 ) ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the proportion of the sample with no individuals, ''m'' is the mean sample density, ''a'' and ''b'' are constants. Like Taylor's law this equation has been found to fit a variety of populations including ones that obey Taylor's law. Unlike the negative binomial distribution this model is independent of the mean density.

The derivation of this equation is straightforward. Let the proportion of empty units be ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and assume that these are distributed exponentially. Then

&lt;math&gt; p_0 = \exp( -A m^B ) &lt;/math&gt;

Taking logs twice and re arranging, we obtain the equation above. This model is the same as that proposed by Nachman.

The advantage of this model is that it does not require counting the individuals but rather their presence or absence. Counting individuals may not be possible in many cases particularly where insects are the matter of study.

;Note

The equation was derived while examining the relationship between the proportion ''P'' of a series of rice hills infested and the mean severity of infestation&amp;nbsp;''m''. The model studied was

: &lt;math&gt; P = 1 - a e^{ b m } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' are empirical constants. Based on this model the constants ''a'' and ''b'' were derived and a table prepared relating the values of ''P'' and&amp;nbsp;''m''

;Uses

The predicted estimates of ''m'' from this equation are subject to bias&lt;ref name=Binns1990&gt;Binns MR &amp; Bostonian NJ (1990) Robustness in empirically based binomial decision rules for integrated pest management. J Econ Entomol 83: 420–442&lt;/ref&gt; and it is recommended that the adjusted mean ( ''m''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; ) be used instead&lt;ref name=Nachman1984&gt;Nachman G (1984) Estimates of mean population density and spatial distribution of ''Tetranychus urticae'' (Acarina: Tetranychidae) and ''Phytoseiulus persimilis'' (Acarina: Phytoseiidae) based upon the proportion of empty sampling units. ''J Appl Ecolog'' 21: 903-991&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; m_a = m \left( 1 - \frac { \operatorname{var}( \log( m_i ) ) } 2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where var is the variance of the sample unit means ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m'' is the overall mean.

An alternative adjustment to the mean estimates is&lt;ref name=Nachman1984/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; m_a = m e^{ ( \text{MSE} / 2 ) } &lt;/math&gt;

where MSE is the mean square error of the regression.

This model may also be used to estimate stop lines for enumerative (sequential) sampling. The variance of the estimated means is&lt;ref name=Schaalje1991&gt;Schaalje GB, Butts RA, Lysyk TL (1991) Simulation studies of binomial sampling: a new variance estimator and density pre&amp;ctor, with special reference to the Russian wheat aphid (Homoptera: Aphididae). J Econ Entomol 84: 140–147&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{var}( m ) = m^2 ( c_1 + c_2 - c_3 + MSE ) &lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt; c_1 = \frac{ \beta^2 ( 1 - p_0 ) }{ n p_0 \log_e( p_0 )^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; c_2 = \frac{ \text{MSE} } { N } + s_{\beta}^2 ( \log_e( \log_e( p_0 ) ) - p^2 ) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; c_3 = \frac{ \exp( a + ( b - 2 )[\alpha - \beta \log_e( p_0 ) ] ) } n &lt;/math&gt;

where MSE is the [[mean square error]] of the regression, ''α'' and ''β'' are the constant and slope of the regression respectively, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance of the slope of the regression, ''N'' is the number of points in the regression, ''n'' is the number of sample units and ''p'' is the mean value of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the regression. The parameters ''a'' and ''b'' are estimated from Taylor's law:

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = a + b \log_e( m ) &lt;/math&gt;

===Hughes–Madden equation===

Hughes and Madden have proposed testing a similar relationship applicable to binary observations in cluster, where each cluster contains from 0 to n individuals.&lt;ref name="Hughes&amp;Madden1992"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; var_\text{obs} = a p^b ( 1 - p )^c &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are constants, ''var&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the observed variance, and p is the proportion of individuals with a trait (such as disease), an estimate of the probability of an individual with a trait. In logarithmic form, this relationship is

: &lt;math&gt; \log( \operatorname{var}_\text{obs} ) = \log( a ) + b \log( p ) + c \log( 1 - p ) .&lt;/math&gt;

In most cases, it is assumed that ''b = c'', leading to a simple model

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{var}_\text{obs} = a ( p( 1 - p ) )^b &lt;/math&gt;

This relationship has been subjected to less extensive testing than Taylor's law. However, it has accurately described over 100 data sets, and there are no published examples reporting that it does not works.&lt;ref name="Turechek et al.2011"/&gt;

A variant of this equation was proposed by Shiyomi et al. (&lt;ref name=Shiyomi1998&gt;Shiyomi M, Egawa T, Yamamoto Y (1998) Negative hypergeometric series and Taylor's power law in occurrence of plant populations in semi-natural grassland in Japan. Proceedings of the 18th International Grassland Congress on grassland management. The Inner Mongolia Univ Press pp 35–43 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;) who suggested testing the regression

: &lt;math&gt; \log( \operatorname{var}_\text{obs} / n^2 ) = a + b \log( p ( 1 - p ) / n ) &lt;/math&gt;

where var&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt; is the variance, ''a'' and ''b'' are the constants of the regression, ''n'' here is the sample size (not sample per cluster) and ''p'' is the probability of a sample containing at least one individual.

===Negative binomial distribution model===

A negative binomial model has also been proposed.&lt;ref name=Wilson1983&gt;Wilson L T &amp; Room PM (1983) Clumping patterns of fruit and arthropods in cotton, with implications for binomial sampling. Environ Entomol 12: 50–54&lt;/ref&gt; The dispersion parameter (''k'') using the method of moments is ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / ( ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; – ''m'' ) and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the proportion of samples with counts &gt; 0. The ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; used in the calculation of ''k'' are the values predicted by Taylor's law. ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is plotted against 1 - ( ''k'' ( ''k'' + ''m'' ) &lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; and the fit of the data is visually inspected.

Perry and Taylor have proposed an alternative estimator of ''k'' based on Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Perry1986&gt;Perry JN &amp; Taylor LR(1986). Stability of real interacting populations in space and time: implications, alternatives and negative binomial. J Animal Ecol 55: 1053–1068&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; 1/k = am^{ b - 2 } - 1 / m&lt;/math&gt;

A better estimate of the dispersion parameter can be made with the method of [[maximum likelihood]]. For the negative binomial it can be estimated from the equation&lt;ref name="Bliss1953"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \sum \frac { A_x } { k + x } = N \log( 1 + m / k ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is the total number of samples with more than ''x'' individuals, ''N'' is the total number of individuals, ''x'' is the number of individuals in a sample, ''m'' is the mean number of individuals per sample and ''k'' is the exponent. The value of ''k'' has to be estimated numerically.

Goodness of fit of this model can be tested in a number of ways including using the chi square test. As these may be biased by small samples an alternative is the ''U'' statistic – the difference between the variance expected under the negative binomial distribution and that of the sample. The expected variance of this distribution is ''m'' + ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / ''k'' and

: &lt;math&gt; U = s^2 - m + m^2 / k &lt;/math&gt;

where ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the sample variance, ''m'' is the sample mean and ''k'' is the negative binomial parameter.

The variance of U is&lt;ref name="Bliss1953"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{var}( U ) = 2m p^2 q \left( \frac { 1 - R^2 } {-\log( 1 - R ) - R } \right) + p^4 \frac { (1 - R)^{-k} - 1 - kR } { N ( -\log( 1 - R ) - R)^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'' = ''m'' / ''k'', ''q'' = 1 + ''p'', ''R'' = ''p'' / ''q'' and ''N'' is the total number of individuals in the sample. The expected value of ''U'' is 0. For large sample sizes ''U'' is distributed normally.

Note: The negative binomial is actually a family of distributions defined by the relation of the mean to the variance

&lt;math&gt; \sigma^2 = \mu + a \mu^p &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''p'' are constants. When ''a'' = 0 this defines the Poisson distribution. With ''p'' = 1 and ''p'' = 2, the distribution is known as the NB1 and NB2 distribution respectively.

This model is a version of that proposed earlier by Barlett.

===Tests for a common dispersion parameter===

The dispersion parameter (''k'')&lt;ref name="Bliss1953"/&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt; k = m^2 / ( s^2 - m ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the sample mean and ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance. If ''k''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is &gt; 0 the population is considered to be aggregated; ''k''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 the population is considered to be random; and if ''k''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is &lt; 0 the population is considered to be uniformly distributed.
 
Southwood has recommended regressing ''k'' against the mean and a constant&lt;ref name=Southwood1978 /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; k_i = a + b m_i &lt;/math&gt;

where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the dispersion parameter and the mean of the ith sample respectively to test for the existence of a common dispersion parameter (''k''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;). A slope (''b'') value significantly &gt; 0 indicates the dependence of ''k'' on the mean density.

An alternative method was proposed by Elliot who suggested plotting ( ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''m'' ) against ( ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / ''n'' ).&lt;ref name=Elliot1977a&gt;Elliot JM (1977) Some methods for the statistical analysis of samples of benthic invertebrates. 2nd ed. Freshwater Biological Association, Cambridge, United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt; ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to 1/slope of this regression.

===Charlier coefficient===

This coefficient (''C'') is defined as

&lt;math&gt; C = \frac{ 100 ( s^2 - m )^{0.5} } { m } &lt;/math&gt;

If the population can be assumed to be distributed in a negative binomial fashion, then ''C'' = 100 (1/''k'')&lt;sup&gt;0.5&lt;/sup&gt; where ''k'' is the dispersion parameter of the distribution.

===Cole's index of dispersion===

This index (''I''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) is defined as&lt;ref name=Cole1946&gt;Cole LC (1946) A theory for analyzing contagiously distributed populations. Ecol 27: 329–341&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; I_c = \frac{ \Sigma x^2 }{ ( \Sigma x )^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

The usual interpretation of this index is as follows: values of ''I''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1, 1, &gt; 1 are taken to mean a uniform distribution, a random distribution or an aggregated distribution.

Because ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = Σ x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − (Σx)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the index can also be written

: &lt;math&gt; I_c = \frac{ s^2 + ( nm )^2 }{ ( nm )^2 } = \frac{ 1 }{ n^2} \frac{ s^2 }{ m^2 } + 1 &lt;/math&gt;

If Taylor's law can be assumed to hold, then

: &lt;math&gt; I_c = \frac{ a m^{ b - 2 } }{ n^2 } + 1 &lt;/math&gt;

===Lloyd's indexes===

Lloyd's index of mean crowding (''IMC'') is the average number of other points contained in the sample unit that contains a randomly chosen point.&lt;ref name=Lloyd1967&gt;Lloyd M (1967) Mean crowding. J Anim Ecol 36: 1–30&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ IMC } = m + s^2 / m - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the sample mean and ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance.

Lloyd's index of patchiness (''IP'')&lt;ref name="Lloyd1967"/&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ IP } = \text{IMC} / m &lt;/math&gt;

It is a measure of pattern intensity that is unaffected by thinning (random removal of points). This index was also proposed by Pielou in 1988 and is sometimes known by this name also.

Because an estimate of the variance of ''IP'' is extremely difficult to estimate from the formula itself, LLyod suggested fitting a negative binomial distribution to the data. This method gives a parameter ''k''

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = m + \frac{ m^2 }{ k } &lt;/math&gt;

Then

: &lt;math&gt; SE( IP ) = \frac{ 1 }{ k^2 } [ \operatorname{var}( k ) + \frac{ k ( k + 1 ) ( k + m ) }{ mq } ] &lt;/math&gt;

where ''SE''(''IP'') is the standard error of the index of patchiness,''var''(''k'') is the variance of the parameter ''k'' and ''q'' is the number of [[quadrat]]s sampled..

If the population obeys Taylor's law then

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ IMC } = m + a^{ -1 } m^{ 1 - b } - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ IP } = 1 + a^{ -1 } m^{ - b } - \frac { 1 } { m } &lt;/math&gt;

===Patchiness regression test===

Iwao proposed a patchiness regression to test for clumping&lt;ref name=Iwao1968b&gt;Iwao S &amp; Kuno E (1968) Use of the regression of mean crowding on mean density for estimating sample size and the transformation of data for the analysis of variance. Res Pop Ecology, 10, 210–214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ifoulis2006&gt;Ifoulis AA, Savopoulou-Soultani M (2006) Developing optimum sample size and multistage sampling plans for ''Lobesia botrana'' (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) larval infestation and injury in northern Greece. J Econ Entomol 99(5):1890–1898&lt;/ref&gt;

Let

: &lt;math&gt; y_i = m_i + s^2 / m_i - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; here is Lloyd's index of mean crowding.&lt;ref name="Lloyd1967"/&gt; Perform an ordinary least squares regression of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; against&amp;nbsp;''y''.

In this regression the value of the slope (''b'') is an indicator of clumping: the slope&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 if the data is Poisson-distributed. The constant (''a'') is the number of individuals that share a unit of habitat at infinitesimal density and may be &lt; 0, 0 or &gt; 0. These values represent regularity, randomness and aggregation of populations in spatial patterns respectively. A value of ''a'' &lt; 1 is taken to mean that the basic unit of the distribution is a single individual.

Where the statistic ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / ''m'' is not constant it has been recommended to use instead to regress Lloyd's index against ''am'' + ''bm''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; where ''a'' and ''b'' are constants.&lt;ref name=Ho1993&gt;Ho CC (1993) Dispersion statistics and sample size estimates for ''Tetranychus kanzawai'' (Acari: Tetranychidae) on mulberry. Environ Entomol 22: 21–25&lt;/ref&gt;

The sample size (''n'') for a given degree of precision (''D'') for this regression is given by&lt;ref name="Ho1993"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; n = \left( \frac{ t }{ D } \right)^2 ( \frac{ a + 1 } { m } + b - 1 )&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is the constant in this regression, ''b'' is the slope, ''m'' is the mean and ''t'' is the critical value of the t distribution.

Iawo has proposed a sequential sampling test based on this regression.&lt;ref name=Iwao1975&gt;Iwao S (1975) A new method of sequential sampling to classify populations relative to a critical density. Res Popul Ecol 16: 281–28&lt;/ref&gt; The upper and lower limits of this test are based on critical densities m&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; where control of a pest requires action to be taken.

: &lt;math&gt; N_u = im_c + t( i ( a + 1 ) m_c + ( b - 1 ) m_c^2 )^{ 1 / 2 } &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; N_l = im_c - t( i ( a + 1 ) m_c + ( b - 1 ) m_c^2 )^{ 1 / 2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; are the upper and lower bounds respectively, ''a'' is the constant from the regression, ''b'' is the slope and ''i'' is the number of samples.

Kuno has proposed an alternative sequential stopping test also based on this regression.&lt;ref name=Kuno1969&gt;Kuno E (1969) A new method of sequential sampling to obtain the population estimates with a fixed level of precision. Res. Pooul. Ecol 11: 127–136&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; T_n = \frac { a + 1 } { D^2 - \frac { b - 1 } n } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the total sample size, ''D'' is the degree of precision, ''n'' is the number of samples units, a is the constant and b is the slope from the regression respectively.

Kuno's test is subject to the condition that ''n'' ≥ (''b'' − 1) / ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Parrella and Jones have proposed an alternative but related stop line&lt;ref&gt;Parrella MP, Jones VP (1985) Yellow traps as monitoring tools for ''Liriomyza trifolii'' (Diptera: Agromyzidae) in chrysanthemum greenhouses. J Econ Entomol 78, 53-56&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; T_n = \left( 1 - \frac { n } { N } \right) \frac { a + 1 } { D^2 - \left( 1 - \frac { n } { N } \right) \frac { b - 1 } { n } } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' are the parameters from the regression, ''N'' is the maximum number of sampled units and ''n'' is the individual sample size.

===Morisita’s index of dispersion===

Morisita's index of dispersion ( ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; ) is the scaled probability that two points chosen at random from the whole population are in the same sample.&lt;ref name=Morisita1959&gt;Morisita M (1959) Measuring the dispersion and the analysis of distribution patterns. Memoires of the Faculty of Science, Kyushu University Series E. Biol 2:215–235&lt;/ref&gt; Higher values indicate a more clumped distribution.

: &lt;math&gt; I_m = \frac { \sum x ( x - 1 ) } { n m ( m - 1 ) } &lt;/math&gt;

An alternative formulation is

: &lt;math&gt; I_m = n \frac{ \sum x^2 - \sum x } { ( \sum x )^2 - \sum x } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the total sample size, ''m'' is the sample mean and ''x'' are the individual values with the sum taken over the whole sample.
It is also equal to

: &lt;math&gt; I_m = \frac { n IMC } { ( nm - 1 ) } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''IMC'' is Lloyd's index of crowding.&lt;ref name="Lloyd1967"/&gt;

This index is relatively independent of the population density but is affected by the sample size. Values &gt; 1 indicate clumping; values &lt; 1 indicate a uniformity of distribution and a value of 1 indicates a random sample.

Morisita showed that the statistic&lt;ref name="Morisita1959"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; I_m ( \sum x - 1 ) + n - \sum x &lt;/math&gt;

is distributed as a chi squared variable with ''n'' − 1 degrees of freedom.

An alternative significance test for this index has been developed for large samples.&lt;ref name=Pedigo1994&gt;Pedigo LP &amp; Buntin GD (1994) Handbook of sampling methods for arthropods in agriculture. CRC Boca Raton FL&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; z = \frac { I_m - 1 } { ( 2 / n m^2 ) } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the overall sample mean, ''n'' is the number of sample units and ''z'' is the normal distribution [[abscissa]]. Significance is tested by comparing the value of ''z'' against the values of the [[normal distribution]].

A function for its calculation is available in the statistical [[R language]]. [http://cc.oulu.fi/~jarioksa/softhelp/vegan/html/dispindmorisita.html R function]

===Standardised Morisita’s index===

Smith-Gill developed a statistic based on Morisita's index which is independent of both sample size and population density and bounded by −1 and +1. This statistic is calculated as follows&lt;ref name=Smith-Gill1975&gt;Smith-Gill SJ (1975) Cytophysiological basis of disruptive pigmentary patterns in the leopard frog ''Rana pipiens''. II. Wild type and mutant cell specific patterns. J Morphol 146, 35–54&lt;/ref&gt;

First determine Morisita's index ( ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; ) in the usual fashion. Then let ''k'' be the number of units the population was sampled from. Calculate the two critical values

: &lt;math&gt; M_u = \frac { \chi^2_{ 0.975 } - k + \sum x } { \sum x - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; M_c = \frac { \chi^2_{ 0.025 } - k + \sum x } { \sum x - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

where χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the chi square value for ''n'' − 1 degrees of freedom at the 97.5% and 2.5% levels of confidence.

The standardised index ( ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ) is then calculated from one of the formulae below

When ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1

: &lt;math&gt; I_p = 0.5 + 0.5 ( \frac { I_d - M_c } { k - M_c } ) &lt;/math&gt;

When ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 1

: &lt;math&gt; I_p = 0.5 ( \frac { I_d - 1 } { M_u - 1 } ) &lt;/math&gt;

When 1 &gt; ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; I_p = -0.5 ( \frac { I_d - 1 } { M_u - 1 } ) &lt;/math&gt;

When 1 &gt; ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; I_p = -0.5 + 0.5 ( \frac { I_d - M_u } { M_u } ) &lt;/math&gt;

''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ranges between +1 and −1 with 95% confidence intervals of ±0.5. ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; has the value of 0 if the pattern is random; if the pattern is uniform, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0 and if the pattern shows aggregation, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0.

===Southwood's index of spatial aggregation===

Southwood's index of spatial aggregation (''k'') is defined as

: &lt;math&gt; \frac {1}{k} = \frac{m^*}{m} - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the mean of the sample and ''m''* is Lloyd's index of crowding.&lt;ref name=Southwood1978 /&gt;

===Fisher's index of dispersion===

Fisher's [[index of dispersion]]&lt;ref name=Elliot1977b&gt;Elliot JM (1977) Statistical analysis of samples of benthic invertebrates. Freshwater Biological Association. Ambleside&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fisher1925&gt;Fisher RA (1925) Statistical methods for research workers. Hafner, New York&lt;/ref&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ID} = \frac{( n - 1 ) s^2 }{ m } &lt;/math&gt;

This index may be used to test for over dispersion of the population. It is recommended that in applications n &gt; 5&lt;ref name=Hoel1943&gt;Hoel P (1943) On the indices of dispersion. Ann Math Statist 14: 155&lt;/ref&gt; and that the sample total divided by the number of samples is &gt; 3. In symbols

: &lt;math&gt; \frac { \sum x } { n } &gt; 3 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''x'' is an individual sample value. The expectation of the index is equal to ''n'' and it is distributed as the [[chi-square distribution]] with ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 degrees of freedom when the population is Poisson distributed.&lt;ref name=Hoel1943 /&gt; It is equal to the scale parameter when the population obeys the [[gamma distribution]].

It can be applied both to the overall population and to the individual areas sampled individually. The use of this test on the individual sample areas should also include the use of a Bonferroni correction factor.

If the population obeys Taylor's law then

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ ID } = ( n - 1 ) a m^{ b - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

===Index of cluster size===

The index of cluster size (''ICS'') was created by David and Moore.&lt;ref name=David1954&gt;David FN &amp; Moore PG (1954) Notes on contagious distributions in plant populations. Ann Bot of London 18:47-53&lt;/ref&gt; Under a random (Poisson) distribution ''ICS'' is expected to equal 0. Positive values indicate a clumped distribution; negative values indicate a uniform distribution.

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ ICS } = s^2 / m - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance and ''m'' is the mean.

If the population obeys Taylor's law

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ ICS } = a m^{ b - 1 } - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

The ''ICS'' is also equal to Katz's test statistic divided by ( ''n'' / 2 )&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; where ''n'' is the sample size. It is also related to Clapham's test statistic. It is also sometimes referred to as the clumping index.

===Green’s index===

Green's index (''GI'') is a modification of the index of cluster size that is independent of ''n'' the number of sample units.&lt;ref name=Green1966&gt;Green RH (1966) Measurement of non-randomness in spatial distributions. Res Pop Ecol 8:1-7&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; C_x = \frac { s^2 / m - 1 } { nm - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

This index equals 0 if the distribution is random, 1 if it is maximally aggregated and −1 / ( ''nm'' − 1 ) if it is uniform.

The distribution of Green's index is not currently known so statistical tests have been difficult to devise for it.

If the population obeys Taylor's law

: &lt;math&gt; C_x = \frac { a m^{ b - 1 } - 1 } { ( nm - 1 ) }&lt;/math&gt;

===Binary dispersal index===

Binary sampling (presence/absence) is frequently used where it is difficult to obtain accurate counts. The dispersal index (''D'') is used when the study population is divided into a series of equal samples ( number of units = ''N'': number of units per sample = ''n'': total population size = ''n'' x ''N'' ).&lt;ref name=Gottwald2007&gt;Gottwald TR, Bassanezi RB, Amorim L, Bergamin-Filho A (2007) Spatial pattern analysis of citrus canker-infected plantings in São Paulo, Brazil, and augmentation of infection elicited by the Asian leafminer. Phytopathology 97(6):674–683&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical variance of a sample from a population with a binomial distribution is

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = n p ( 1 - p ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance, ''n'' is the number of units sampled and ''p'' is the mean proportion of sampling units with at least one individual present. The dispersal index (''D'') is defined as the ratio of observed variance to the expected variance. In symbols

: &lt;math&gt; D = \frac {var_{ obs } } { var_{ bin } } = \frac{ s^2 } { n p ( 1 - p ) }&lt;/math&gt;

where ''var''&lt;sub&gt;''obs''&lt;/sub&gt; is the observed variance and ''var''&lt;sub&gt;''bin''&lt;/sub&gt; is the expected variance. The expected variance is calculated with the overall mean of the population. Values of ''D'' &gt; 1 are considered to suggest aggregation. ''D''( ''n'' − 1 ) is distributed as the chi squared variable with ''n'' - 1 degrees of freedom where ''n'' is the number of units sampled.

An alternative test is the ''C'' test.&lt;ref name=Hughes1993&gt;Hughes G &amp; Madden LV (1993) Using the beta-binomial distribution to describe aggregated patterns of disease incidence. Phytopathology 83:759−763&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; C = \frac { D( n N - 1 ) - n N } { ( 2 N ( n^2 - n ) ) ^{ 1 / 2 } } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''D'' is the dispersal index, ''n'' is the number of units per sample and ''N'' is the number of samples. C is distributed normally. A statistically significant value of C indicates [[overdispersion]] of the population.

''D'' is also related to [[intraclass correlation]] ( ρ ) which is defined as&lt;ref name=Fleiss1981&gt;Fleiss JL (1981) Statistical methods for rates and proportions. 2nd ed. Wiley, Newy York, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \rho = 1 - \frac{ \sum x_i ( T - x_i ) } { p ( 1 - p ) N T ( T - 1 ) } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is the number of organisms per sample, ''p'' is the likelihood of the organism having the sought after property (diseased, pest free, ''etc''), and x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of organism in the ''i''th unit with this property. ''T'' must be the same for all sampled units. In this case with ''n'' constant

: &lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac{ D - 1 } { n - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

If the data can be fitted with a [[beta-binomial distribution]] then&lt;ref name="Fleiss1981"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; D = 1 + \frac{ ( n - 1 ) \theta }{ 1 + \theta } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''θ'' is the parameter of the distribution.&lt;ref name=Hughes1993 /&gt;

===Ma's population aggregation critical density===

Ma has proposed a parameter (''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) − the population aggregation critical density - to relate population density to Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Ma1991&gt;Ma ZS (1991) Further interpreted Taylor’s Power Law and population aggregation critical density. Trans Ecol Soc China (1991) 284–288&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; m_0 = \exp( \frac{ \log ( a ) }{ 1 - b } ) &lt;/math&gt;

==Related statistics==

A number of statistical tests are known that may be of use in applications.

===de Oliveria's statistic===

A related statistic suggested by de Oliveria&lt;ref name=deOliveria1965&gt;de Oliveria T (1965) Some elementary tests for mixtures of discrete distributions, ''in'' Patil, GP ''ed.'', Classical and contagious discrete distributions. Calcutá, Calcutta Publishing Society pp379-384&lt;/ref&gt; is the difference of the variance and the mean.&lt;ref name=Bohning1994&gt;Bohning D (1994) A note on a test for Poisson overdispersion. Biometrica 81(2) 418-419&lt;/ref&gt; If the population is Poisson distributed then

: &lt;math&gt; var( s^2 - m ) = \frac{ 2t^2 } { n - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is the Poisson parameter, ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance, ''m'' is the mean and ''n'' is the sample size. The expected value of ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - ''m'' is zero. This statistic is distributed normally.&lt;ref name=Ping1995&gt;Ping S (1995) Further study on the statistical test to detect spatial pattern. Biometrical J 37(2) 199–203&lt;/ref&gt;

If the Poisson parameter in this equation is estimated by putting ''t'' = ''m'', after a little manipulation this statistic can be written

: &lt;math&gt; O_T = \sqrt { \frac { n - 1 } { 2 } } \frac { s^2 - m } { m } &lt;/math&gt;

This is almost identical to Katz's statistic with ( ''n'' - 1 ) replacing ''n''. Again ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; is normally distributed with mean 0 and unit variance for large ''n''. This statistic is the same as the Neyman-Scott statistic.

;Note

de Oliveria actually suggested that the variance of ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - ''m'' was ( 1 - 2''t''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; + 3''t'' ) / ''n'' where ''t'' is the Poisson parameter. He suggested that ''t'' could be estimated by putting it equal to the mean (''m'') of the sample. Further investigation by Bohning&lt;ref name="Bohning1994"/&gt; showed that this estimate of the variance was incorrect. Bohning's correction is given in the equations above.

===Clapham's test===

In 1936 Clapham proposed using the ratio of the variance to the mean as a test statistic (the relative variance).&lt;ref name=Clapham1936&gt;Clapham AR (1936) Overdispersion in grassland communities and the use of statistical methods in plant ecology. J Ecol 14: 232&lt;/ref&gt; In symbols

: &lt;math&gt; \theta = \frac{ s^2 }{ m } &lt;/math&gt;

For a Possion distribution this ratio equals 1. To test for deviations from this value he proposed testing its value against the chi square distribution with ''n'' degrees of freedom where ''n'' is the number of sample units. The distribution of this statistic was studied further by Blackman&lt;ref name=Blackman1942&gt;Blackman GE (1942) Statistical and ecological studies on the distribution of species in plant communities. I. Dispersion as a factor in the study of changes in plant populations. Ann Bot N.s. vi: 351&lt;/ref&gt; who noted that it was approximately normally distributed with a mean of 1 and a variance ( ''V''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; ) of

: &lt;math&gt; V_{ \theta } = \frac{ 2n } { ( n - 1 )^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

The derivation of the variance was re analysed by Bartlett&lt;ref name=Greig-Smith1952&gt;Greig-Smith P (1952) The use of random and contiguous quadrats in the study of the structure of plant communities. Ann. Bot. 16:293-316&lt;/ref&gt; who considered it to be

: &lt;math&gt; V_{ \theta } = \frac{ 2 } { n - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

For large samples these two formulae are in approximate agreement. This test is related to the later Katz's ''J''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; statistic.

If the population obeys Taylor's law then

: &lt;math&gt; \theta = am^{ b - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

;Note

A refinement on this test has also been published&lt;ref name=Gosset1986&gt;Gosset E, Louis B (1986) The binning analysis - Towards a better significance test. Astrophysics Space Sci 120 (2) 263-306&lt;/ref&gt; These authors noted that this test tends to detect overdispersion at higher scales even when this was not present in the data. They noted that the use of the multinomial distribution may be more appropriate than the use of a Poisson distribution for such data. The statistic ''θ'' is distributed

: &lt;math&gt; \theta = \frac{ s^2 }{ m } = \frac{ 1 } { n } \sum{ ( x_i - \frac{ n }{ N } )^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the number of sample units, ''n'' is the total number of samples examined and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are the individual data values.

The expectation and variance of ''θ'' are

: &lt;math&gt; E( \theta ) = \frac{ N } { N - 1} &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; Var( \theta ) = \frac{ ( N - 1 )^2 } { N^3 } - \frac { 2N - 3 } { nN^2 }&lt;/math&gt;

For large ''N'' ''E''(θ) is approximately 1 and

: &lt;math&gt; Var( \theta ) \sim\ \frac{ 2 } { N } ( 1 - \frac{ 1 } { n } ) &lt;/math&gt;

If the number of individuals sampled ( ''n'' ) is large this estimate of the variance is in agreement with those derived earlier. However, for smaller samples these latter estimates are more precise and should be used.
