Typically, ''abstraction'' is used in the arts as a [[synonym]] for [[abstract art]] in general.

==In the visual arts==
Strictly speaking, it refers to art unconcerned with the literal depiction of things from the visible world&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9003405/abstract-art Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;—it can, however, refer to an object or image which has been distilled from the real world, or indeed, another work of art. Artwork that reshapes the natural world for expressive purposes is called abstract; that which derives from, but does not imitate a recognizable subject is called nonobjective abstraction. In the 20th century the trend toward abstraction coincided with advances in science, technology, and changes in urban life, eventually reflecting an interest in psychoanalytic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine de Zegher and Hendel Teicher (eds.), ''3 X Abstraction''. NY/New Haven: The Drawing Center/Yale University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|0-300-10826-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later still, abstraction was manifest in more purely formal terms, such as color, freedom from objective context, and a reduction of form to basic geometric designs and shapes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100410114556/http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm National Gallery of Art: Abstraction.] Retrieved 31 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
In music, the term ''abstraction'' can be used to describe improvisatory approaches to interpretation, and may sometimes indicate abandonment of [[tonality]]. [[Atonal]] music has no key signature, and is characterized by the exploration of internal numeric relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714025231/http://public.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/ABSTRACT.HTM Washington State University: Glossary of Abstraction.] Retrieved 31 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apollonius of Tyre''' is the subject of an ancient short novella, popular in the Middle Ages.  Existing in numerous forms in many languages, the text is thought to be translated from an ancient Greek manuscript, now lost.

==Plot summary==

In most versions, the eponymous hero is hunted and persecuted after he reveals Antiochus of Antioch's [[incestuous]] relationship with his daughter. After many travels and adventures, in which Apollonius loses both his wife and his daughter and thinks them both dead, he is eventually reunited with his family through unlikely circumstances or intercession by gods. In some English versions Apollonius is shipwrecked and becomes a tutor to a princess who falls in love with him, and the good king gradually discovers his daughter's wishes. The major themes are the punishment of inappropriate lust&amp;mdash;the incestuous king invariably comes to a bad end&amp;mdash;and the ultimate rewards of love and fidelity.

==Origins (Latin and Greek?)==

The story is first mentioned in Latin by [[Venantius Fortunatus]] in his ''Carmina'' (Bk. vi. 8, 11. 5–6) during the late 6th century;&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Apollonius of Tyre|volume=2|pages=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is conjectured, based on similarities with the ''[[Ephesian Tale]]'' of [[Xenophon of Ephesus]] and the presence of idioms awkward in Latin but typical in Greek, that the original was a [[Greek language|Greek]] romance of the third century.&lt;ref name = Gill&gt;Stuart Gillespie, ''Shakespeare's Books'' (2001) p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Some fragments of Greek romance, however, point to the possibility of an even older date.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England'', New York Burt Franklin, 1963, p. 170–171.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest manuscripts of the tale, in a Latin version, date from the 9th or 10th century but are from late antiquity. Thus they show an intersection of Greek and Roman as well as pre-Christian and Christian influences.&lt;ref&gt;Stelios Panayotakis, [http://www.fiec2009.org/proposals/panayotakis.pdf "Figuring the Body in ''The Story of Apollonius, King of Tyre''."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726052614/http://www.fiec2009.org/proposals/panayotakis.pdf |date=July 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the work is classed with other ancient Greek romance novels.&lt;ref&gt;B. P. Reardon, editor, ''Collected Ancient Greek Novels'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars hold that the [[riddle]]s with which the king tests the hero in many versions may be a later addition:&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, op. cit., p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; ten derive from the c. fourth-century Latin riddle-collection attributed to [[Symphosius]].&lt;ref&gt;Chauncey E. Finch, 'Codex Vat. Barb. Lat. 721 as a Source for the Riddles of Symphosius', ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'', 98 (1967), 173-79 (p. 173); DOI: 10.2307/2935872; https://www.jstor.org/stable/2935872.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars believe the incest story to have been a later addition as well, though others, including Elizabeth Archibald, see it as an integral thematic element of the tale.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Archibald, ''Apollonius of Tyre: Medieval and Renaissance Themes and Variations'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widespread Latin versions are those of [[Gottfried von Viterbo]], who incorporated it into his ''[[Pantheon (book)|Pantheon]]'' of 1185 as if it were actual history, ''Historia Apollonii regis Tyri'' and a version in the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, op. cit., p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==
'Fifty to a hundred versions' of the story are known from antiquity into the early modern period, mostly European, including texts in English, Dutch, German, Danish, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Hungarian, Greek, and Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Goldberg, ''Turandot's Sisters: A Study of the Folktale AT 851'', Garland Folklore Library, 7 (New York: Garland, 1993), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest vernacular translation is an incomplete [[Old English language|Old English]] prose text from the 11th century, sometimes called the first [[English novel]]. The existence of this unique text is unusual, as secular prose fiction from that time is extremely rare. The manuscript copy may only have survived because it was bound into a book together with Archbishop Wulfstan's homilies.&lt;ref&gt;Goolden, Peter ''The Old English Apollonius of Tyre'' Oxford University Press 1958 xxxii-xxxiv&lt;/ref&gt; Various versions of the tale were later written in most European languages.

A notable English version is in the eighth book of [[John Gower]]'s ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' (1390), which uses it as an [[exemplum]] against [[lust]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;  It is described as being based on ''Pantheon'', but it contains many details that work does not but the old ''Historia'' does.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England'' p165–6 New York Burt Franklin,1963&lt;/ref&gt;

Its numerous vernacular versions, along with the Latin ones, attest to its popularity throughout the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England'' p165 New York Burt Franklin,1963&lt;/ref&gt; It appears in an old Danish ballad collected in ''[[Danmarks gamle Folkeviser]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England'' p168 New York Burt Franklin,1963&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Copland]] translated from the French the romance of ''Kynge Appolyne of Thyre'' (W. de Worde, 1510).

==Later versions and influence==

The story was retold in thirteenth-century [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]] as ''[[Libro de Apolonio]]''.

Robert Copland wrote an early 16th-century prose version.

[[Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'' was based in part on Gower's version, with the change of name probably inspired by [[Philip Sidney]]'s ''[[Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia|Arcadia]]''.  ''Apollonius of Tyre'' was also a source for his plays ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' and ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]''.

[[Image:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire The Arcadian or Pastoral State 1836.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[Thomas Cole]]'s ''[[The Arcadian or Pastoral State]]'', 1834]]
'''Arcadia''' ({{lang-gr|Αρκάδια}}) refers to a vision of [[pastoralism]] and harmony with [[nature]]. The term is derived from the [[Arcadia|Greek province of the same name]] which dates to [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]; the province's mountainous topography and sparse population of pastoralists later caused the word ''Arcadia'' to develop into a poetic byword for an idyllic vision of unspoiled wilderness. Arcadia is a poetic shaped space associated with bountiful natural splendor and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/12811403/Dead_Poets_in_the_bay_of_Rosas_Spain_la_Gargouille_de_la_Platja_de_Canyelles_Petites|title=Dead Poets in the bay of Rosas (Spain) –la Gargouille de la Platja de Canyelles Petites.|first=Pierre-François|last=Puech|date=|website=academia.edu|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Garden' is often inhabited by [[shepherds]]. The concept also figures in [[Renaissance]] [[mythology]].  Although commonly thought of as being in line with [[Utopia]]n ideals, Arcadia differs from that tradition in that it is more often specifically regarded as unattainable.  Furthermore, it is seen as a lost, [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]ic form of life, contrasting to the progressive nature of [[Utopia]]n desires.

The inhabitants were often regarded as having continued to live after the manner of the [[Golden Age]], without the pride and avarice that corrupted other regions.&lt;ref&gt;Bridget Ann Henish, ''The Medieval Calendar Year'', p96, {{ISBN|0-271-01904-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sometimes referred to in English poetry as '''Arcady'''. The inhabitants of this region bear an obvious connection to the figure of the [[noble savage]], both being regarded as living close to nature, uncorrupted by civilization, and virtuous.

== In antiquity ==
According to Greek mythology, [[Arcadia]] of [[Peloponnesus]] was the domain of [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], a virgin wilderness home to the god of the forest and his court of dryads, nymphs and other spirits of nature. It was one version of [[paradise]], though only in the sense of being the abode of supernatural entities, not an afterlife for deceased mortals.

Greek mythology inspired the Roman poet [[Virgil]] to write his ''[[Eclogues]]'', a series of poems set in Arcadia.

== In the Renaissance  ==
[[Image:Thomas Eakins - Arcadia.jpg|left|thumb|[[Thomas Eakins]]' ''Arcadia'']]
Arcadia has remained a popular artistic subject since antiquity, both in visual arts and literature. Images of beautiful nymphs frolicking in lush forests have been a frequent source of inspiration for painters and sculptors. As a result of the influence of [[Virgil]] in medieval European literature (see, for example, ''[[Divine Comedy]]''), ''Arcadia'' became a symbol of [[pastoral]] simplicity. [[Renaissance|European Renaissance]] writers (for instance, the Spanish poet [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso de la Vega]]) often revisited the theme, and the name came to apply to any idyllic location or paradise. Unlike the word "[[utopia]]" (named for [[Thomas More]]'s book, ''[[Utopia (Novel)|Utopia]])'', "Arcadia" does not carry the connotation of a human civilization; Arcadia is presented as the spontaneous result of life lived naturally, uncorrupted by civilization.

Of particular note is ''[[Et in Arcadia ego]]'' by [[Nicholas Poussin]], which has become famous both in its own right and because of its (possible) connection with the [[gnostic histories]] of the [[Rosicrucians]]. In 1502 [[Jacopo Sannazaro]] published his long poem ''Arcadia'' that fixed the Early Modern perception of Arcadia as a lost world of idyllic bliss, remembered in regretful dirges.  In the 1580s Sir [[Philip Sidney]] circulated copies of his influential heroic romance poem The ''[[Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia]]'' establishing Arcadia as an icon of the [[Renaissance]]; although the story is plentifully supplied with shepherds and other pastoral figures, the central characters of the plot are all royalty visiting the countryside. The Spanish playwright and poet [[Lope de Vega]] also published in 1598 his ''Arcadia: Prose and Verse'', which was a bestseller for its time.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Does not the pleasantness of this place carry in itself sufficient reward for any time lost in it, or for any such danger that might ensue? Do you not see how everything conspires together to make this place a heavenly dwelling? Do you not see the grass, how in color they excel the emeralds ...? Do not these stately trees seem to maintain their flourishing old age, with the only happiness of their seat being clothed with a continual spring, because no beauty here should ever fade? Doth not the air breathe health which the birds (both delightful both to the ear and eye) do daily solemnize with the sweet consent of their voices? Is not every echo here a perfect music? And these fresh and delightful brooks, how slowly they slide away, as, loath to leave the company of so many things united in perfection, and with how sweet a murmur they lament their forced departure. Certainly, certainly, cousin, it must needs be, that some goddess this desert belongs unto, who is the soul of this soil, for neither is any less than a goddess worthy to be shrined in such a heap of pleasures, nor any less than a goddess could have made it so perfect a model of the heavenly dwellings.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Friedrich August von Kaulbach - In Arcadia.jpg|thumb|[[Friedrich August von Kaulbach]]'s ''In Arcadia'']]
Though depicted as contemporary, this pastoral form is often connected with the [[Golden Age]].  It may be suggested that its inhabitants have merely continued to live as people did in the Golden Age, and all other nations have less pleasant lives because they have allowed themselves to depart from the original simplicity.

==Geographical usage==

Arcadia is now the name of many cities and towns around the world, including upwards of a dozen municipalities in the US. [[Arcadia University]] is a college located in [[Glenside, Pennsylvania]]. The plotlands of Wales and England have been referred to by media and local Government as Arcadia.

=== Acadia ===
The 16th-century Italian explorer [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] applied the name "Arcadia" to the entire North American Atlantic coast north of [[Virginia]]. In time, this mutated to ''[[Acadia]]''. The ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'' says: "Arcadia, the name Verrazzano gave to Maryland or Virginia 'on account of the beauty of the trees', made its first cartographical appearance in the 1548 Gastaldo map and is the only name on that map to survive in Canadian usage. . . . In the 17th century Champlain fixed its present orthography, with the 'r' omitted, and [[William Francis Ganong|Ganong]] has shown its gradual progress northwards, in a succession of maps, to its resting place in the Atlantic Provinces".

Revival of Mi'kmaw language has provided strong reason to believe that Verrazzano was informed by the name the Mi'kmaq gave to this place. The name Acadie may be derived from the Mi'kmaq, because in their language the word “cadie” means "place of abundance” and can be found in names such as “Tracadie” and “Shubenacadie”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museeacadien.org/an/online-resources/frequently-asked-questions/du-mot-%C2%AB-acadie-%C2%BB/|title=What is the meaning of the word "Acadie"? » Acadian Museum of Prince Edward Island|author=|date=|website=museeacadien.org|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern western culture ==
{{further|Arcadia in popular culture}}
Arcadia has been a popular setting for writers of the 19th and 20th centuries, including [[W. S. Gilbert]] (in ''[[Happy Arcadia]]'' and ''[[Iolanthe]]''). One of the most popular [[Edwardian musical comedies]] is ''[[The Arcadians (musical)|The Arcadians]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Green, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, [[Evelyn Waugh]] sub-titled the first part of his novel ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'' "[[Et in Arcadia ego]]". In [[Gabriel García Márquez]]'s novel ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'', the founder and patriarch of the [[Macondo]] community bears the name José Arcadio Buendía. Over the course of the novel, Arcadio becomes a multigenerational [[patronym]] that resonates with many of the other utopian tropes explored elsewhere in the text. In the novel ''[[Blood Meridian]]'' by [[Cormac McCarthy]], the character of [[Judge Holden]] names his rifle "[[Et in Arcadia ego]]". In 1993, [[Tom Stoppard]] wrote [[Arcadia (play)|''Arcadia'']] (originally to have been titled ''[[Et in Arcadia ego]]''), a play involving themes of [[classical beauty]] and order in nature.

[[Arcadia (band)|Arcadia]] were a spin-off musical group formed in 1985 by three members of the band [[Duran Duran]]. Rock band [[The Libertines]] have referenced Arcadia as the destination their imaginary ship ''Albion'' sails towards. Canadian [[music producer]] [[Deadmau5]] has a song called Arcadia. The Kite String Tangle also have a song titled Arcadia.
The metal opera ''[[Angel of Babylon]]'' by [[Tobias Sammet]]'s [[Avantasia]] ends with "Journey to Arcadia".

In fantasy literature, Arcadia has been used as a magical realm, respective to the [[fictional universe]] in which the story occurs. [[Arcadia Darell]] is the name of a character in ''[[Second Foundation]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]]. In the [[anime]] series ''[[Captain Harlock]]'', the ship in which he travels is known as the ''Arcadia''. He calls it the place "to fight and live for our freedom [and dreams]".  In the recent movie ''[[Resident Evil: Extinction]]'', the characters seek to travel to Arcadia, Alaska, which is promised to be free of zombies. In ''[[Resident Evil: Afterlife 3D]]'', it is revealed that Arcadia refers to the USS ''Arcadia'', a ship that collects survivors for [[Human subject research|experimentation]]. ''[[Arcadia (novel)|Arcadia]]'' (2016) is the title of a novel by [[Iain Pears]].

A number of [[role-playing games]] have also adopted the idea, either using it as a separate realm within the multiverse (à la the [[Arcadia (plane)|Arcadia]] of the [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] universe), or even using it as the central focus of an entire game system (as in [[White Wolf, Inc.|White Wolf]]'s [[Changeling: The Dreaming]] game). In [[Changeling: The Lost]], Arcadia is presented as a hellish realm, where humans abducted by the True Fae are subject to unimaginable torment and torture, in sharp contrast to its usual utopian description. ''[[Dragonhaven]]'', a [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] [[fantasy]] novel by [[Robin McKinley]], ends with the phrase "Arcadiae vias peregrinentur," which the author has stated roughly translates to "May they walk in Arcadia".  According to the best-selling PC-game ''[[The Longest Journey]]'', [[Arcadia (The Longest Journey)|Arcadia]] was divided from the primordial original world, and represents fantasy, dreams and magic, while our world, [[Stark (The Longest Journey)|Stark]], is the world of science and technology. In the game ''[[BioShock]]'', Arcadia is a level in which the protagonist has to navigate through an artificial forest. Arcadia was created by Dr. Julie Langford. This forest provides the oxygen for the rest of the underwater city of Rapture, and was used as a peaceful retreat for the citizens. Arcadia is the name of the world in the [[Sega]] [[Dreamcast]] game ''[[Skies of Arcadia]]'' in which the inhabitants live on floating islands and continents, and fly through the skies in airships. "Neo Arcadia" is the name given to the now center-of-the-world paradise city in the post-apocalyptic world of the ''[[Mega Man Zero]]'' series, as a place where humans and reploids live together side by side, though the Neo Arcadian government proves to be overbearing &amp; ruthless in the fight against mavericks, going so far as to unjustly condemn innocent reploids to retirement(i.e. death). As such, they are the main antagonistic force throughout the majority of the "Zero" series.
In "The Longest Journey" and "Dreamfall" PC games, Arcadia is a realm of magic which the player is transported to.

The name has recently been connected with the [[pseudo-history]] of the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] - in particular the [[Latin]] [[motto]] "[[Et in Arcadia ego]]" ("Even here, I [Death] exist.") The phrase is used frequently in [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] fiction and lore, such as the pseudo-historical work ''[[Holy Blood, Holy Grail]]'' and the novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', where it is interpreted as an anagram of ''I! Tego Arcana Dei'' ("Begone! I know the secrets of God").

Arcadia is also the name given to the second-city of the [[Time Lord|Time Lord's]] home-planet [[Gallifrey]] in the British sci-fi TV series [[Doctor Who]].  The Gods of Arcadia is a sci-mythology series by Andrea Stehle.  It is a world in mankind's future controlled by the gods of ancient Greece.

An '''artist-run initiative''' is any project run by artists, including [[Sound art|sound]] or [[visual artist]]s, to present their and others' projects. They might approximate a traditional [[art gallery]] space in appearance or function, or they may take a markedly different approach, limited only by the artist's understanding of the term. "Artist-run initiatives" is an umbrella name for many types of artist generated activity. 

One such group, the Belfast-based [[Catalyst Arts]], wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Artist-run means initiating exchange; emphasizing cross and inter-disciplinary approaches to making art; developing networks; through curation, putting creative ideas and
arguments into action" &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author =Catalyst Arts| title = Life/Live| place = Paris | publisher = Musée d’Art Moderne| year = 1996|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Artist-run initiatives also play a role in hosting international artists: they may also include guest studios or even international [[Artist in residence]] programs.

[[File:Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia 1682 Claude Lorrain.jpg|thumb|320px|''Landscape with Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia'', [[Ashmolean Museum]]]]
[[File:Claude Lorrain - Aeneas's Farewell to Dido in Carthago - WGA05017.jpg|thumb|320px|''View of Carthage with Dido and Aeneas'', 1676, [[Kunsthalle, Hamburg]]]]

'''''Landscape with Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia''''' is a painting of 1682 in oil on canvas by [[Claude Lorrain]] (Claude Gellée, traditionally just "Claude" in English), a painter from the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] who spent his career in Rome.  It was painted in Rome for Prince [[Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna]] (1637–1689), Claude's most important patron in his last years, and is now in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]].  It is signed, dated with the year, and inscribed with the subject (at centre bottom), as Claude sometimes did with his less common subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Kitson, 31; Wine (1994), 24, 101&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Claude's last painting, and is perhaps not quite finished; it therefore does not appear in the ''[[Liber Veritatis]]'', where he made drawings to record his finished works. His date of birth is uncertain, but he was at least in his late seventies when he painted it, perhaps as old as 82. It was a [[pendant painting|pendant]] to his painting, completed six years earlier, ''View of Carthage with Dido and Aeneas'' (or ''Aeneas's Farewell to Dido in Carthage'', 1676, now [[Kunsthalle, Hamburg]]), another scene from the ''[[Aeneid]]'', coming earlier than this one.  This was the last of Claude's many harbour scenes.  With the Oxford painting hung on the left, the groups of figures in each face inwards, and the main buildings frame the outsides of the pair.&lt;ref&gt;Kitson, 31; Wine (1994), 101&lt;/ref&gt;  Both paintings feature large columns on a classical building, a punning reference to the [[Colonna family]], who included such a column in their coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;Wine (1994), 101, 103&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting depicts a scene from [[s:Aeneid (Dryden)/Book VII|book 7]], verses 483–499, of [[Virgil]]'s epic poem the ''[[Aeneid]]''.  [[Aeneas]]'s son [[Ascanius]] shoots a stag that is the house-reared pet of Silvia, daughter of "Tyrrheus, chief ranger to the Latian king" ([[John Dryden]]'s translation), provoking a war with [[Latium]] for the future site of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Kitson, 31&lt;/ref&gt;  Virgil's account, over 16 lines, spends most of them describing the closeness of the relationship between Sylvia and the stag.  The moment shown is one of stillness, as Ascanius takes aim and the stag, too trusting in its special status, looks at him. Once the arrow is fired the tranquil coastal landscape spreading out behind them will very quickly be disrupted by the war that Virgil goes on to describe.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 207&lt;/ref&gt;  

Unusually for Claude, the sky is overcast with storm clouds, and the trees are bent by a wind blowing from the left.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 207–208&lt;/ref&gt;  The elaborate temple in the [[Corinthian order]] has long been falling into ruin.  On the face of it this, in a scene from before the founding of Rome, is an anachronism that would have been apparent even in the 17th century, but it reflects the state to which ancient Roman monuments were reduced in Claude's own time.  The painting therefore embraces the whole trajectory of Roman civilization across history, from its start to its end, and peoples an idealized landscape from Claude's time with figures from its early history.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 212–214&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Subject and composition==
[[File:RomanVirgilFolio163r.jpg|thumb|[[Vergilius Romanus]], 5th-century, [[Vatican Library]], Cod. Vat. lat. 3867, f 163 recto]]
The subject is very rare in art, but there is a composition by [[Rubens]], with a painting in [[Girona]] and an [[oil sketch]] in the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], showing a different point in the story.  This is also a late work, but the composition could hardly be more different; here Sylvia nurses the dying stag as a female companion keeps the hounds off it, and fighting has broken out behind them between the Latins and Ascanius' party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/102467.html?mulR=140804051%7C20 ''The Death of Silvia's Stag''], Philadelphia Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt;  

Claude may well have been aware of a depiction in the [[Vergilius Romanus]], a 5th-century illustrated manuscript of the works of Virgil in the [[Vatican Library]] (Cod. Vat. lat. 3867, f 163 recto), which was a subject of interest to Roman cognoscenti. Stripped of the landscape the elements in the picture are similar, though Ascanius has already wounded the stag, and is pulling the bow for a second shot. A scene closer to the Rubens, with the wounded stag finding Silvia, is in the [[Vergilius Vaticanus]] of about 400; curiously, this is the point where the two [[Late antique]] Virgil cycles of illustration come closest to matching.&lt;ref&gt;Stansbury, Mark, Review of ''Wright, David H. The Roman Vergil and the Origins of Medieval Book Design. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2002." in ''The Medieval Review'', Indiana University, 2003, [https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/tmr/article/view/15504/21622 online text]&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition evolved through a series of drawings, beginning in 1669, with two now at [[Chatsworth House]] (1671 or 1678) and the Ashmolean (1682).&lt;ref&gt;Kitson, 31, 50–51; Wine (1994), 103; Waterhouse, 220&lt;/ref&gt; The final composition, with the river separating the archer and the stag, was only arrived at late in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Wine (1994), 21, 103&lt;/ref&gt;  As in the pendant in Hamburg, and many paintings by Claude, the composition draws the viewer's gaze into the background by having two large ''[[repoussoir]]'' elements at each side, where one is very close at hand, and the other set much further back.  The diagonal from left to right thus set up is balanced by the river, which flows in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 209–211&lt;/ref&gt;

==The figures==
[[File:Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia 1682 Claude Lorrain (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The group of hunters]]
Although virtually every painting by Claude contains figures, even if only a shepherd, their weakness has always been recognised, not least by Claude himself; according to his biographer [[Filippo Baldinucci]] he joked that he charged for his landscapes, but gave the figures for free. According to his other contemporary biographer [[Joachim von Sandrart]] he had made considerable efforts to improve them, but without success; certainly there are numerous studies, typically for groups of figures, among his drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Wine (1994), 12–14; Blunt, 275, n. 243&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Claude's last years his figures tend to become ever more elongated, a process taken to an extreme in this painting, of which even its owner says "The hunters are impossibly elongated – Ascanius, in particular, is absurdly top-heavy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.org/assets/docs/Exhibitions/AshmoleanPressImagesClaudeLorrain.pdf Ashmolean Press summary] for ''Claude Lorrain: The Enchanted Landscape'' in 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Its pendant has figures almost as extreme.  With the mid-20th fashion for medical diagnosis through art, it was suggested that Claude had developed an optical condition producing such effects, but this has been rejected by doctors and critics alike.

==Critical appreciation==
[[File:Якоб_Фердинанд_Воет._Портрет_Лоренцо_I_Онофрио_Колонна_(1684-1689),_герцога_и_князя_Палиано.jpg|thumb|200px|Prince [[Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna]], the patron, by [[Jacob Ferdinand Voet]]]]
Despite the figures, the painting has been one of the most admired of Claude's works. For [[Anthony Blunt]], it "reveals all the qualities of the artist's last phase ... The range of colour is reduced to its utmost limits: silvery green trees, pale grey-blue sky, grey architecture, and neutral-coloured dresses for the figures. The trees are now so diaphanous and the portico is so open that they hardly interrupt the continuity of the air.  The figures are thin and elongated, so that they, too, have the immaterial quality suited to this fairyland.  All the elements of Claude's poetry are here in their most naked form, but combined in a magical way which defies analysis".&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 176&lt;/ref&gt; 

For the Claude specialist [[Michael Kitson]] it "at once sums up and goes beyond Claude's previous development. It is utterly personal and yet has that profound, tremulous and remote quality which characterizes the style of other great artists in their old age."&lt;ref&gt;Kitson, 31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance and prices==
Once completed, the painting remained in the [[Colonna Palace]] in Rome until 1798/9,&lt;ref&gt;Kitson, 31&lt;/ref&gt; when the French occupied Rome, alarming the great families of the nobility.  Along with many other top paintings from Roman collections, it was bought by the English collector, dealer, writer, and curator [[William Young Ottley]]. Ottley brought it to London, at a time when Claudes were fetching huge prices.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 39–40, 274–275&lt;/ref&gt;  It was sold at [[Christie's]] on 16 May 1801 for £462, being from now on separated from its pendant, which fetched £840.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_tgGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA26 Sale details] in the ''Memoirs of painting, with a chronological history of the importation of pictures by the great masters into England since the French revolution'' (1824) by [[William Buchanan (art dealer)|William Buchanan]]. Nos # 31 and 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was bought by the banker [[Sir Thomas Baring, 2nd Baronet|Sir Thomas Baring, Bt]], and was at his house [[Stratton Park]], Hampshire, by 1837. It remained in the [[Baring family]] collection until the [[Francis Baring, 2nd Earl of Northbrook|2nd Earl of Northbrook]] sold it at Christie's in 1919 for £588; by this time prices for Claudes had plunged, allowing for inflation.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 276; Ashmolean&lt;/ref&gt;  It was given to the Ashmolean in 1926 by Mrs F. Weldon.&lt;ref&gt;Kitson, 31; Ashmolean&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bharat Mata.jpg|right|thumb|''Bharat Mata'' by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871-1951), a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and a pioneer of the movement]]
The '''Bengal School of Art''' commonly referred as '''Bengal School''',&lt;ref name=ngma/&gt; was an [[art movement]] and a style of [[Indian painting]] that originated in [[Bengal]], primarily [[Kolkata]] and [[Shantiniketan]], and flourished throughout [[India]] during the [[British Raj]] in the early 20th century. Also known as 'Indian style of painting' in its early days, it was associated with [[Indian nationalism]] ([[swadeshi]]) and led by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871-1951), but was also promoted and supported by British arts administrators like [[Ernest Binfield Havell|E. B. Havell]], the principal of the [[Government College of Art, Kolkata]] from 1896; eventually it led to the development of the [[modern Indian painting]].&lt;ref name=ngma/&gt;&lt;ref name=benartmitter&gt;{{cite book |title=Art and nationalism in colonial India, 1850-1922: occidental orientations |last=Mitter |first=Partha |authorlink= |author2= |year= 1994|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-44354-8 |chapter=How the past was salvaged by Swadeshi artists |pages=267–306 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mRTtkri8E0C |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=benartatlas&gt;{{cite book |title=Atlas of world art |last=Onians |first=John |authorlink= |author2= |year= 2004|publisher=Laurence King Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-85669-377-6 |page= 304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3h2KfXoOPYC |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Bengal}}
The Bengal school arose as an [[avant garde]] and nationalist movement reacting against the [[academic art]] styles previously promoted in India, both by Indian artists such as [[Raja Ravi Varma]] and in British art schools. Following the influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the [[Western world|West]], the British art teacher [[Ernest Binfield Havell]] attempted to reform the teaching methods at the [[Calcutta School of Art]] by encouraging students to imitate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitter|first=Partha |title=Indian art |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FHxsDV1GDOIC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=Ernest+Binfield+Havell+education#v=onepage&amp;q=Ernest%20Binfield%20Havell%20education&amp;f=false|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-284221-8|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ny"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/arts/design/20bose.html|title=Art Review: Indian Modernism via an Eclectic and Elusive Artist|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=August 19, 2008|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havell was supported by the artist [[Abanindranath Tagore]], a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. Tagore painted a number of works influenced by [[Mughal painting|Mughal art]], a style that he and Havell believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the "materialism" of the West. Tagore's best-known painting, ''Bharat Mata'' (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. Tagore later attempted to develop links with Japanese artists as part of an aspiration to construct a [[pan-Asianism|pan-Asianist]] model of art. Through the paintings of 'Bharat Mata', Abanindranath established the pattern of patriotism. Painters and artists of Bengal school were [[Nandalal Bose]], M.A.R Chughtai, [[Sunayani Devi]] (sister of Abanindranath Tagore), [[Manishi Dey]], [[Mukul Dey]], [[Kalipada Ghoshal]], [[Asit Kumar Haldar]], [[Sudhir Khastgir]], Kshitindranath Majumdar, [[Sughra Rababi]], [[D. P. Roy Choudhury|Debi Prasad Roychoudhury]], Bireswar Sen, [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha]], Kiron Sinha,TP [[Gaganendranath Tagore]] (Tagore's brother)

The Bengal school's influence in India declined with the spread of [[modernist]] ideas in the 1920s. {{As of|2012}}, there has been a surge in interest in the Bengal school of art among scholars and connoisseurs.&lt;ref name=benarttoi&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-12/special-report/31051756_1_bengal-school-bengal-art-bengal-masters| title=For many art lovers, it's back to the old school| last=Ghose | first=Archana Khare |newspaper=Times of India| location=New Delhi|date=12 February 2012|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
However, Bengal continues to produce some of the best artists of modern India. There is a department in the Government College Of Art &amp; Craft that has been training students the traditional style of tempera and wash painting for almost a century now. These students are carrying the legacy of the Bengal School artists, who, initially, were a group of artists, following Abanindranath's style and sharing his aesthetic vision. Among them, Dhirendranath Brahma is the living legend of the Bengal School of Art. He is a master of calligraphy and has innumerable students who are carrying on the tradition of Bengal School of painting. Among the other renowned artists of this style of painting are Ajoy Ghosh, Sankarlal Aich, Amal Chaklader, Narendranath De Sarkar, Sukti Subhra Pradhan &amp; Ratan Acharya. 
Some of the best known artists of present-day Bengal are [[Jogen Chowdhury]], [[Mrinal Kanti Das]], [[Gopal Sanyal]], [[Ganesh Pyne]], [[Manishi Dey]], [[Shanu Lahiri]], Ganesh Haloi &lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Shanu Lahiri dead|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130202/jsp/calcutta/story_16510654.jsp#.UUISlTeEnuo|newspaper=The Telegraph (Calcutta)|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jahar Dasgupta]], Samir Aich, [[Bikash Bhattacharjee]], Sudip Roy, Ramananda Bandopadhyay and  [[Devajyoti Ray]].
Sanat Chatterjee is one of the last living pioneers of Bengal School of art. He studied under Asit Kumar Haldar for around fifteen years.

==R. Siva Kumar's disagreement ==
{{main article|Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism}}
[[R. Siva Kumar]], who has been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and their approach to art since the early 80s, refutes the practice of subsuming [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] under the '''Bengal School of Art'''. According to Siva Kumar, 'This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice'.&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;

His ideas on this issue are formulated in the catalogue essay of the exhibition [[Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism]].

In the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], the '''''chorêgos''''' (pl. ''chorêgoi''; {{lang-el|χορηγός}}, [[Greek etymology]]: χορός "chorus" + ἡγεῖσθαι "to lead"){{#tag:ref|The Attic and Doric form was "χορᾱγός" (choragos) rather than the more usual Greek form "χορηγός" (choregos).&lt;ref&gt;[[A Greek–English Lexicon|Liddell and Scott]], p. 1668&lt;/ref&gt; The later forms of the word in [[Latin]] (choragus) and Italian (corago) followed the Attic spelling.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/32286?redirectedFrom=choragus "choragus, n."], ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', September 2013. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 9 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} was a wealthy [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] citizen who assumed the public duty, or ''choregiai'', of financing the preparation for the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] and other aspects of dramatic production that were not paid for by the government of the ''[[polis]]'' or [[city-state]].&lt;ref name=Brockett&gt;Brockett, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Anglicized forms of the word include '''choragus''' and '''choregus''', with the accepted plurals being the Latin forms ''choregi'' and ''choragi''.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; In modern Greek the word ''χορηγός'' is synonymous with the word "grantor".&lt;ref&gt;Pring, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

''Choregoi'' were appointed by the [[archon]] and the tribes of Athenian citizens from among the Athenian citizens of great wealth. Service as a ''choregos'', though an honor, was a duty for wealthy citizens and was part of the [[Liturgy (ancient Greece)|liturgical]] system designed to improve the city-state's economic stability through the use of private wealth to fund public good.  Choregoi paid for costumes, rehearsals, expenses of the chorus (including training, salaries, board and lodging), scenery, props (including elaborate [[Theatre of ancient Greece#Masks|masks]]), special effects and most of the musicians.  The ''choregos'' also hosted a feast if his chorus proved victorious in competition. The prizes for drama at the Athenian festival competitions were awarded jointly to the playwright and the ''choregos''.&lt;ref name=Brockett/&gt; Such victories carried prestige for the ''choregos''. Several notable political figures served as ''choregoi'', including [[Themistocles]], [[Pericles]] and [[Plato]], among others.  Monuments were built in honor of victorious ''choregoi''.

At the turn of the 17th century AD, in an attempt to recreate the ancient Greek dramatic tradition, the position was revived briefly in Italian opera, and combined the roles of impresario and director.

==Nomination and appointment==
Under the [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] constitution, ''choregoi'' were appointed by the [[archon]] and the [[Phyle|tribes]] of Athenian citizens. The archon appointed ''choregoi'' for the tragedies, while the tribes supplied five ''choregoi'' for the comedies as well as ''choregoi'' for the [[Dionysia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Choragus|volume=6|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thargelia]] (the major festival competitions).&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;  The archon, who began this process months in advance of a festival, were able easily to identify potential dramatic ''choregoi'' because their mutual wealth allowed them to move in the same social circles as the most qualified candidates. In order to be considered for the role of ''choregos'', an individual had to be an Athenian citizen and possess great wealth. ''Choregoi'' for [[Greek chorus|choruses]] of boys were required by Athenian law to be over forty years old to protect the young participants. Volunteers from this selected group of qualified individuals may have been the source of most appointments. The figure of the ''choregos'' can be traced back as early as the 7th century B.C. References to the title are found in recovered portions of the earliest choral lyric poetry, including the ''Parthenia'' (or "Maiden-songs") of [[Alkman]], a poet of archaic [[Sparta]].&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;Wilson, pp. 53–61, 113 and 198–213&lt;/ref&gt;

Service as a ''choregos'', though an honor, was a duty rather than a choice for wealthy citizens. This duty was one among many built into the state [[Liturgy (ancient Greece)|liturgical]] system of ancient Athens, which was designed to improve the city-state's economic stability through the use of private wealth to fund public good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaiser|first=Brooks A.|title=The Athenian Trierarchy: Mechanism Design for the Private Provision of Public Goods|journal=The Journal of Economic History|date=June 2007| volume=67|issue=2| page=448| jstor=4501159| doi=10.1017/s0022050707000162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once nominated, however, a potential ''choregos'' had three choices. He could accept the nomination and the duty. Through a process called ''skepsis'', he could claim one of several specifically defined exemptions and be excused from service. Finally, he could identify another Athenian who was more qualified to perform the role of ''choregos'' and use the procedure of ''skepsis'' to resolve the matter.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

==Duties of the ''choregoi''==
Choregoi were responsible for supporting many aspects of [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatre]] production in ancient Athens: paying for costumes, rehearsals, the chorus, scenery or scene painting (including such items as ''[[mechane]]'' and ''[[ekkyklema]]''), props (including elaborate [[Theatre of ancient Greece#Masks|masks]]), special effects, such as sound, and musicians, except that the state provided the flute player and paid the actors not in the chorus.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, William; Wayte, William; Marindin, G.E. Ed. (1890). [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0063%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DC%3Aentry+group%3D5%3Aentry%3Dchoregus-cn "Choragus"]. ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities''. perseus.tufts.edu. Retrieved 17 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; At the City Dionysia in Athens, for example, the ''choregos'' was expected to finance all aspects relating to the chorus, which could include training, the hiring of an expert to execute such training, salaries, and board and lodging during a lengthy rehearsal period.&lt;ref name=Foley/&gt;

The ''choregos'' did not act as the director for the production; this role was fulfilled by the playwright.&lt;ref&gt;The playwright also appeared in the production and acted as the ''didaskalos'' or teacher, instructing the other principal actors. See Brockett, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''choregos'' would appoint a ''chorodidaskalos'' (Χοροδιδάσκαλος, often shortened to διδάσκαλος), often the playwright, to train the chorus.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, 18-33&lt;/ref&gt; The ''choregos'' was often expected to host a feast, analogous to a modern cast party, should his chorus prove victorious in competition.&lt;ref name=Foley/&gt; According to the ''Oxford Dictionary of the Classical World'': "The sums spent on choregiai show that the duty could elicit vast expenditure. One extremely enthusiastic choregos catalogues a list which represents an outlay of nearly two and a half talents. This includes a dithyrambic choregia at the Little Panathenaea for 300 drachmae, and a tragic choregia for 3,000 dr. The latter figure is roughly ten times what a skilled worker might have earned annually."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, John (ed.) "chorēgia", ''Oxford Dictionary of the Classical World'', Oxford University Press, 2007 {{ISBN|9780192801463}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reorganization of the ''choregia'' in 406 BC spread the cost among the wider community – the synchoregia – with the ''choregos'' paying only part of the expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Capps| first=Edward|title=The Dramatic Synchoregia at Athens|journal=The American Journal of Philology|year=1896| volume=17| issue=3| pages=319–328| jstor=288240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prizes and recognition==
[[File:Choragic Monument of Lysicrates.jpg|thumb|Choragic Monument of Lysicrates near the Acropolis in Athens, Greece]]
The prizes for drama at the Dionysia were awarded jointly to the playwright and the ''choregos''.&lt;ref name=Brockett/&gt; Originally the ''choregos'' acted on behalf of his tribe, which collectively won the [[wikt:kudos#Noun|kudos]] for a successful performance. Gradually the sponsoring ''choregoi'' asserted more personal responsibility, and by the fourth century BC the prize for the ''choregos'' was a personal award. The winner was expected to display his trophy in a place of honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buck|first=Carl D.|title=Discoveries in the Attic Deme of Ikaria 1888. III. The Choregia in Athens and at Ikaria. Inscriptions from Ikaria Nos. 5-7|journal=The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts|date=March 1889|volume=5|issue=1|pages=18–33|jstor=495931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such victories carried prestige for the ''choregos'', and these honors could be an important stepping stone to a successful political career for wealthy young Athenians. Conversely, failure to successfully execute one's role as a ''choregos'' could lead to social humiliation.&lt;ref name=Foley&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foley| first=Helene| title=Choral Identity in Greek Tragedy|journal=Classical Philology|date=January 2003|volume=98|issue=1|page=3| doi=10.1086/378725| jstor=10.1086/378725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorious ''choregoi'' were honored further with the erection of a monument in honor of their accomplishment. These monuments, which have become an important source of scholarly knowledge about the ''choregoi'', were the final step in the victory celebration, which also involved a parade and a feast. Each monument featured an eloquent inscription that echoed the original victory announcement made at the Dionysia.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

==Notable ''choregoi''==
Greek society was a symbiosis of art and politics, and several notable political figures of the time served as ''choregoi''. [[Themistocles]] was ''choregos'' for [[Phrynichus (tragic poet)|Phrynichus']] ''Phoenissae'' (named for the Phoenician women who formed the chorus), and [[Pericles]] acted as ''choregos'' for ''[[The Persians]]'' by [[Aeschylus]].&lt;ref&gt;Zelenak, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In 365 BC, [[Plato]], a rare exception to the qualification of wealth, served as ''choregos'' for a boys chorus supported by the patronage of [[Dionysius II of Syracuse]].&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; Choregos Lysicrates is remembered today because of the [[Choragic Monument of Lysicrates|monument]] still standing in Athens erected in honor of the festival victory of his production in 335 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Cou | first1 = Herbert F. | year = 1893 | title = The Frieze of the Choragic Monument of Lysikrates at Athens | url = | journal = The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 42–55 | doi=10.2307/495920| jstor = 495920 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruins of a choragic monument to [[Nicias]] from the 5th-century BC were discovered in Athens in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dinsmoor|first=W.B.|title=The Choragic Monument of Nicias| journal=American Journal of Archaeology|date=October–December 1910|volume=14|issue=4|page=459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropic context==
''Choregoi'' were an example of a larger tradition of cosmopolitanism, defined by an interest in benefiting others, that dominated many aspects of urban life for the wealthy in ancient Greece and which has been linked to Western philanthropy.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller| first=Eugene F.| title=Philanthropy and Cosmopolitanism|journal=The Good Society| year=2006| volume=15| issue=1| pages=51–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these acts, which also included subsidy of temples, armories, and other essential municipal needs, were driven more by personal vanity, societal pressure, and political influence than the modern philanthropic impulse. Nevertheless, the ''choregoi's'' contributions to the theatre of ancient Greece were integral to the flourishing of drama in ancient Greece and the structure of the society's cultural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Philanthropy – Ancient Mediterranean Examples| url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/10645/Philanthropy-Ancient-Mediterranean-Examples.html| accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest references to the philanthropic impulse can be traced to Aeschylus's ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' with the use of the word ''philanthropia'', which is translates to "love of humankind," displaying an early tie between the theatre and the ''choregoi'', and philanthropy.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

==17th-century revival==
At the turn of the 17th century AD, when the first operas were being written in an attempt to recreate the old Greek dramatic tradition, the position of ''choregos'' was revived briefly. It was known in Italian as "corago", and combined the roles of impresario and director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Savage|first=Rover|author2=Matteo Sansone|title=Il Corago and the Staging of Early Opera: Four Chapters from an Anonymous Treatise circa 1630|journal=Early Music|date=November 1989|volume=17|series=The Baroque Stage I|issue=4|pages=494–511|doi=10.1093/earlyj/xvii.4.495|jstor=3127018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Colloquies''''' (Latin title ''Colloquia familiaria'') is one of the many works of the "Prince of Christian [[Humanists]]", [[Desiderius Erasmus]]. Published in 1518, the pages "...held up contemporary religious practices for examination in a more serious but still pervasively ironic tone".&lt;ref&gt;Coffin G. Judith, Stacey C. Robert. Western Civilizations, Ed16 Vol2. W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2008. pp.463&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Humanists viewed Erasmus as their leader in the early 16th century. Erasmus' works had greater meaning to those learned few who had a larger knowledge of Latin and Greek.
Colloquies in Latin means a formal written dialogue, thus in his book Erasmus explores man's reaction to others in conversations.

The ''Colloquies'' is a collection of dialogues on a wide variety of subjects. They began in the late 1490s as informal Latin exercises for Erasmus' own pupils. In about 1522 he began to perceive the possibilities this form might hold for continuing his campaign for the gradual enlightenment and reform of all [[Christendom]]. Between that date and 1533 twelve new editions appeared, each larger and more serious than the last, until eventually some fifty individual colloquies were included ranging over such varied subjects as war, travel, religion, sleep, beggars, funerals, and literature. All of these works were in the same graceful, easy style and gentle humor that made them continually sought as schoolboy exercises and light reading for generations.

The '''Cresta International Advertising Awards''' are a worldwide awards whose purpose is to acknowledge high standards of creative achievement in the international [[advertising]] and [[marketing communications]] industry. It functions through an alternative judging process based upon narrow criteria.&lt;ref name="Riding"&gt;Hooper, Sally: [http://the-gma.com/archives/riding-the-cresta-of-a-creative-wave-international-advertising-awards-finalists-line-up Riding the Cresta of a creative wave - international advertising awards finalists line up] gma: The Global Marketing Alliance, July 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The awards, launched in 1993 by Creative Standards International in partnership with the [[International Advertising Association]],&lt;ref name="About.com Entry"&gt;Duncan, Apryl: [http://advertising.about.com/od/awards/a/adawards_2.htm About: Awards for Advertising] About.com&lt;/ref&gt; were spearheaded by Nancy Ross, who had beforehand helped to run the [[Clio Awards]] for 16 years.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;Elliott, Stuart: [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/23/business/media-business-advertising-new-award-for-ad-creativity-cresta-joins-long-line.html THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; A new award for ad creativity, the Cresta, joins a long line of aspirants for the title of the next Clio.] The New York Times, February 23, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Cresta, which stands for "Creative Standards",&lt;ref name="New Straits"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Time for the Cresta International Advertising Awards |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19990228&amp;id=V6JOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zRQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2444,1856283 |deadurl=no |newspaper=New Straits Times |location=Malaysia |publisher=The New Straits Times Press ||date=1999-02-28 |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; has grown to cover twelve distinct groups of competition: Press, Outdoor, Ambient Media, TV/Cinema/Online Film, Interactive, Radio, Direct Marketing, Design, Incentives &amp; Promotions, Branded Entertainment, Crafts and Integrated Campaigns.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;[http://www.cresta-awards.com/About.aspx About Cresta]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cresta's U.S. headquarters is located in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="Contact"&gt;[http://www.cresta-awards.com/Contact.aspx Contact Cresta]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judging ==
Cresta is an extensive and highly selective awards program, an official 2017 press release noting a reception of more than 3,300 entries from 53 countries for the 2016 competition, with 74 entries from 13 countries designated as winners.&lt;ref name="2014 Press"&gt;[http://www.cresta-awards.com/Press.aspx Cresta Awards Issue Call for Entries in Its 25th Annual Worldwide Creative Competition] Press Release, February 13, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Entries are screened by several international "pre-selection" juries responsible for compiling a shortlist to be given to a Grand Jury of seasoned creative directors, graphic artists, and film specialists from around the world. The Cresta Grand Jury, unlike the pre-selection juries, is a permanent jury consisting of 86 members from 45 countries. Members judge the shortlisted entries on their own time and individually, the no-discussion policy placing stress on creativity solely.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt; This body decides on the Gold, Silver, and Bronze winners, as well as if an entry has met the pre-determined standard of earning a '''Grand Prix''' award, based on two elements: originality of the idea and the quality of the idea's execution.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New Straits" /&gt;  

In 2010, Cresta introduced the '''Network of the Year''' and '''Agency of the Year''' honors, given out to those whose entries meet the highest scores, based on a point breakdown, in all levels of competition.&lt;ref name="2010 Press"&gt;[http://www.cresta-awards.com/PressArchive.aspx 18th Annual Cresta International Advertising Awards Announce Winners] Press Release, October 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==

For its first 12 years in existence, Cresta held its awards ceremony in a number of cities throughout the world, including [[Budapest]], [[Milan]], and [[New York City|New York]]. It was determined after the 2004 awards that future winners would be announced via an online ceremony, allowing exponentially more participants the chance to view the winners.&lt;ref name= "About" /&gt; The annual winners are currently released in a virtual showcase designed for all electronic devices, including mobile phones and tablets.&lt;ref name= "Gallery"&gt;[http://www.cresta-awards.com/Award_Ceremony.aspx Cresta Winners Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Cresta statuette is a crystal "S" shape with an embedded metal "C" component, together meant to embody the "Creative Standards" namesake. This component is color-coded in order to reflect the four levels of winners: Grand Prix, Gold, Silver and Bronze.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;

Entries submitted must be "broadcast, published or released in a commercial environment with client approval" according to a specific timeframe, and additionally accompanied by the respective single or campaign entry fees.&lt;ref name="Current"&gt;[http://www.cresta-awards.com/EntryKit_CurrentInfo.aspx Current Info and Deadlines]&lt;/ref&gt;

In three dimensional [[geometry]], there are four infinite series of [[point groups in three dimensions]] (''n''≥1) with ''n''-fold rotational or reflectional symmetry about one axis (by an angle of 360°/''n'') that does not change the object.

They are the finite [[symmetry group]]s on a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]]. For ''n'' = ∞ they correspond to four [[frieze group]]s. [[Arthur Moritz Schönflies|Schönflies]] notation is used. The terms horizontal (h) and vertical (v) imply the existence and direction of reflections with respect to a vertical axis of symmetry. Also shown are [[Coxeter notation]] in brackets, and, in parentheses, [[orbifold notation]].
[[File:Order 4 dihedral symmetry subgroup tree.png|thumb|Example symmetry subgroup tree for dihedral symmetry: ''D&lt;sub&gt;4h&lt;/sub&gt;'', [4,2], (*224)]]

== Types ==

;Chiral:
*'''''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', [n]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, (''nn'')''' of order ''n'' - ''n''-fold rotational symmetry - '''acro-n-gonal group''' (abstract group [[cyclic group|''Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'']]); for ''n''=1: '''no symmetry''' ([[trivial group]])
;Achiral:
[[File:S shaped packing.jpeg|thumb|Piece of loose-fill [[cushioning]] with ''C&lt;sub&gt;2h&lt;/sub&gt;'' symmetry]]
*'''''C&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'', [n&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2], (''n''*)''' of order 2''n'' - '''prismatic symmetry''' or '''ortho-n-gonal group''' (abstract group [[cyclic group|''Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'']] &amp;times; ''Dih&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''); for ''n''=1 this is denoted by '''''C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' (1*)''' and called '''[[reflection symmetry]]''', also '''[[symmetry (biology)#Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry]]'''. It has [[reflection symmetry]] with respect to a plane perpendicular to the ''n''-fold rotation axis.
*'''''C&lt;sub&gt;nv&lt;/sub&gt;'', [n], (*''nn'')''' of order 2''n'' - '''pyramidal symmetry''' or '''full acro-n-gonal group''' (abstract group ''Dih&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''); in biology  ''C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt;'' is called '''biradial symmetry'''. For ''n''=1 we have again ''C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' (1*). It has vertical mirror planes. This is the symmetry group for a regular ''n''-sided [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]].
*'''''S&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;'', [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2n&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], (''n''&amp;times;)''' of order 2''n'' - '''gyro-n-gonal group''' (not to be confused with [[symmetric group]]s, for which the same notation is used; abstract group ''Z&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;''); It has a 2''n''-fold [[improper rotation|rotoreflection]] axis, also called 2''n''-fold improper rotation axis, i.e., the symmetry group contains a combination of a reflection in the horizontal plane and a rotation by an angle 180°/n. Thus, like ''D&lt;sub&gt;nd&lt;/sub&gt;'', it contains a number of improper rotations without containing the corresponding rotations.
** for ''n''=1 we have ''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' ('''1&amp;times;'''), also denoted by '''''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''''; this is [[Inversion in a point|inversion symmetry]]. 

'''''C&lt;sub&gt;2h&lt;/sub&gt;'', [2,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] (2*)''' and '''''C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt;'', [2], (*22)''' of order 4 are two of the three 3D symmetry group types with the [[Klein four-group]] as abstract group. ''C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt;'' applies e.g. for a rectangular tile with its top side different from its bottom side.

== Frieze groups ==
In the limit these four groups represent Euclidean plane [[frieze group]]s as C&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;∞h&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;∞v&lt;/sub&gt;, and S&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;. Rotations become translations in the limit. Portions of the infinite plane can also be cut and connected into an infinite cylinder.

==History==
[[File:Vikrambhai and amma .jpg|thumb|Founder of Darpana Academy Dr. Vikram Sarabhai and Mrinalini Sarabhai]]

The Darpana Academy of Performing Arts was founded in Ahmedabad, [[Gujarat]], [[India]] by [[Vikram Sarabhai]] and his wife [[Mrinalini Sarabhai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Darpana Academy Official Blog|url=http://darpanaacademy.blogspot.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = In conversation with danseuse Mallika Sarabhai |work= The Hindu | url = http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/dance/in-conversation-with-danseuse-mallika-sarabhai/article7814196.ece |first=G.

The work in using arts foe social change began at Darpana in the 1960s. Darpana’s puppeteers started working with the central ministry of rural development in teaching village women the use of smokeless stove. The theatre department then run by [[Kailash Pandya]] created a play called Ma to rally people to the war effort. [[Mrinalini Sarabhai]], in a radical departure from the spiritual core of the classical [[Bharat Natyam]] used the style to talk of the horror of dowry violence. Over the years two departments were established to focus the work of using the arts for change. Darpana for Dvelopment in 1980, today run by actor activist [[Jignesh Patel]], and Darpana Communication in 2001 run by film maker [[Yadavan Chandran]]. In addition, in 2009 CRANTI(Citizens Resource and Action Initiative)was formed to give practical guidance to citizen to use the laws and tools available to them to fight their own battles, and to train people in the use of the Right To Information Act to solve daily problems of access and justice, run by Bharatsinh Jhala. 
During the last three decades, these departments have worked on over 51 projects all over India, reaching out to over 12.5 million people. The work has been in areas ranging from [[public health]], [[women’s empowerment]], [[gender issues and education to the environment]], [[human rights]], [[communal harmony]], [[good governance]], citizen’s participation in democracy, race, [[gender and disability]]. Through the use of television and film, theatrical and [[street performances]], [[quizzes]] and [[debates]], [[puppets]] and [[board games]]. They have been able to effectively talk about a range of sensitive issues from [[women and violence]], to [[religious intolerance]], the [[Natural environment|environment]], [[human rights]], [[corruption]] and [[justice]].

The academy received [[UNESCO]] sponsorship to offer Artist Residency programs in 1999-2000 and 2005-2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rapport Du Directeur General Sur Les Activites Du Fonds International Pour La Promotion De La Culture (1998-1999)|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001170/117026f.pdf|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|page=9|language=French|date=27 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bursaries for Artists Program UNESCO-Aschberg 2005-2006|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001376/137683m.pdf|publisher=[[UNESCO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = India - Darpana Academy of Performing Arts|work= UNESCO| url = http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=7211&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html | accessdate = 2016-01-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201932/http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=7211&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-date=3 March 2016

==Activities==
[[File:Darpana Academy .jpg|thumb|dance academy]]
The academy offers courses in Indian classical dance [[Bharatanatyam]], Indian Classical Vocal, [[Mridangam]], Violin and Flute, puppetry and martial art [[ Kalaripayattu]]. Its departments range from performance and teaching of the arts, to the use of performance and arts as development communication, through face-to-face impact and software production.

The Drama Section, under acting duo [[Kailash Pandya]] and [[Damini Mehta]], is responsible for more than 100 productions of a wide variety. 

Darpana attracted young writers and staged their first scripts, making them an integral part of production efforts. Some of the names can be mentioned as [[Madhu Rye]], [[Labhshankar Thakar]], [[Shrikant Shah]], [[Subhash Shah]], [[Chinu Modi]], and [[Hasmukh Baradi]]. It also conducted theatre-training courses for over two decades.

Its research wing, Janvak, published monographs like Goverdhan Panchal's on [[Bhavai]]. Darpana has also built an experimental thrust auditorium, Natrani, reminiscent of Greek amphitheatres, on the banks of the river Sabarmati.

Retrieved January 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

She studied Communications/Visual Arts at the [[University of California, San Diego]].&lt;ref name="Bluecat" /&gt;

==Career==
Diane Drake worked for [[Sydney Pollack]]'s production company, Mirage Enterprises, from 1988-1992, rising to the position of Vice President of Creative Affairs.&lt;ref name="Bluecat" /&gt;

===Writing===
Drake began writing screenplays in 1991. Her first screenplay, ''Dog Meets Cat'', though never more than optioned material,&lt;ref name="V1"&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR102541 TriStar ponies up $ 1 mil for 'Him'], ''Variety Magazine''.

She worked on rewriting ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]'', with dogs, in a project that was never produced.&lt;ref name="AS1" /&gt;

In 1992 she wrote a [[spec script]] called ''Him'', which sold to [[TriStar Pictures]] for $1 million.&lt;ref name="V1" /&gt; It was produced in 1994 as ''[[Only You (1994 film)|Only You]]'', starring [[Marisa Tomei]] and [[Robert Downey, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117909066/ 'Only You'], ''Variety Magazine''.

In 1995 Drake wrote a spec script called ''Ladies Man'', in which a male protagonist who works in advertising is able to read women's thoughts. In November 1995, [[Caravan Pictures]] optioned the script for 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-11-17-1995-6 ''Spec sold on way to E.R.''], Daily Variety. Retrieved April 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meyers changed the title of ''Head Games'' to ''What Women Want,'' a line of dialogue taken from Drake's script. The New York Post said:
{{cquote|"Nancy later told Paramount she had never read Diane's screenplay, but the record showed she had taken a meeting with Drake based upon the script's submission as a writing sample," the Paramount source added. Drake had her attorneys contact Paramount, and around Dec. 1, 1999, Paramount paid Drake $700,000 - officially saying it was buying ''Ladies Man''.&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt;}}
Diane Drake has refused to comment on this publicly, but [[Paramount Studios]] granted her a story credit on the 2000 movie. Following arbitration by the [[Writers Guild of America, West|Writers Guild of America]], Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa received both screenplay and story credits.
''[[What Women Want]]'' went on to become the second largest grossing romantic comedy of all time in [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=romanticcomedy.htm Box Office Mojo].

==Plot==
Peter Highman ([[Robert Downey Jr.]]), a successful architect, is due to fly home from Atlanta to Los Angeles to be with his wife Sarah ([[Michelle Monaghan]]), who is about to give birth. On the way to the airport, he has a chance encounter with Ethan Tremblay ([[Zach Galifianakis]]), who is going to LA to be an actor and is planning to scatter his recently deceased father's ashes at the [[Grand Canyon]]. When Ethan misuses the words "[[terrorism|terrorist]]" and "bomb" while talking to Peter, they are both escorted off the plane. This is only the first of a series of misadventures caused by the drastically dysfunctional Ethan. Peter, now on the [[No Fly List]] and missing his wallet, agrees to drive with Ethan to Los Angeles.

Ethan stops to buy [[marijuana]], and Peter discovers that they are nearly out of money. Since Peter has no I.D., he gets his wife to wire the money to Ethan, but discovers Ethan had the money wired to his stage name instead of his legal name. When the Western Union employee ([[Danny McBride (actor)|Danny McBride]]) refuses to accept Ethan's "Stage name I.D." it leads to a violent altercation.

After a night at a [[rest stop]], Peter decides to drive off and abandon Ethan, but realizes that he still has Ethan's father's ashes, having forgotten to unload them with the rest of Ethan's stuff when he left. This causes him to wrestle with his conscience, and he decides to return. Ethan drives so Peter can get some rest, but he falls asleep at the wheel and crashes the car. After Peter and Ethan are picked up by Peter's friend Darryl ([[Jamie Foxx]]), Peter again decides to part company with Ethan. Darryl initially persuades him otherwise, but then throws Ethan out after mistakenly drinking some of Ethan's father's ashes, which were stored in a coffee tin.

When Darryl lets them use his [[Range Rover]] to make the rest of the trip, Ethan mistakenly drives to the [[Mexico–United States border]]. Despite assuring Peter that he'll handle the situation, Ethan flees, and Peter is arrested for possession of marijuana. The [[Mexican Federal Police]] lock Peter up, but Ethan steals a truck and breaks him out, causing several car crashes in the process.

They stop at the [[Grand Canyon]], and Ethan finally scatters his father's ashes. Peter then confesses that he tried to leave Ethan at the rest area. Ethan makes a confession of his own: he has had Peter's wallet and I.D the entire time. Peter seemingly forgives him but then attacks Ethan in a rage, but is interrupted by a call from Sarah, who has just gone into labor. Peter and Ethan leave for California. Ethan finds a gun in the truck and he accidentally shoots Peter. Arriving at the hospital where Sarah is in labor, Peter passes out from loss of blood.

Sarah delivers the baby safely, and Peter expresses his discomfort at his new daughter being named Rosie Highman. Ethan leaves while telling Peter to call him. At the end, Ethan guest stars on an episode of his favorite television program, ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' with Peter and Sarah watching it in bed with their daughter.

===Critical response ===
{{Anchor|Critics|Critical reception}}
''Due Date'' received average reviews. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 40% "rotten", or a 5.2/10 rating, based on 185 reviews. The site's consensus is: "Shamelessly derivative and only sporadically funny, ''Due Date'' doesn't live up to the possibilities suggested by its talented director and marvelously mismatched stars."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film two and a half stars out of a possible four, noting "The movie probably contains enough laughs to satisfy the weekend audience. Where it falls short is in the characters and relationships." Ebert compared ''Due Date'' to the 1987 film ''[[Planes, Trains and Automobiles]]'', but bemoaned that ''Due Date'' could have learned and offered more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Eagle Theatre''' in [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]]-era [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] was the first permanent theatre to be built in the state of [[California]]. Established in 1849 this relatively small structure was originally wood-framed and canvas-covered with a tin roof and a packed earth floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Levy |first1=JoAnn |title=They Saw the Elephant: Women in the California Gold Rush |date=2013 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |isbn=9780806189956 |page=137 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VqbpycFdtXAC |accessdate=29 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre was flooded on Jan 4, 1850.

Located at 925 Front Street, it was one of the earliest structures in the new city. It featured many different types of entertainment for a rough crowd of wild west pioneers and gold miners from the small but rapidly growing area. Tickets to the theater could be obtained at a nearby saloon for two dollars and three dollars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilmeth |first1=Don B. |last2=Bigsby |first2=Christopher |title=The Cambridge History of American Theatre |date=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521472043 |page=17 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HALg37VfRRMC |accessdate=29 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; most likely the Round Tent Saloon then located just to the south of the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=27174 |title=Eagle Theatre |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=California State Parks - Parks and Recreation|publisher=California State Government |access-date=April 21, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the theatre is owned by [[California Department of Parks and Recreation]] and is administered by the [[California State Railroad Museum]] as part of the [[Old Sacramento State Historic Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/684/files/eagle.pdf |title=The Eagle Theatre |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=California State Parks - Gold Rush District |publisher=California State Government |access-date=April 21, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1974 and inspired by the civil rights movement, it has been in the forefront of documenting the artistic journeys created by photographic artists often overlooked by the mainstream art world.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Through its visual arts programs, En Foco strives to balance the inequities of the art world by creating the 'missing pages' in art history. In 1984 it created the bilingual (English/Spanish) photographic magazine ''Nueva Luz'', which concentrates on works by U.S.-based photographers of color. Some photographers En Foco has exhibited or written about are [[Hank Willis Thomas]] and [[Sama Raena Alshaibi]].

== History ==
Inspired by the 1973 traveling exhibition ''Dos Mundos'' (organized by the Institute of Contemporary Hispanic Art and exhibited in New York City, Los Angeles and Puerto Rico), a group of Puerto Rican photographers - Charles Biasiny-Rivera, Phil Dante, and Roger Cabán - banded together to form the core En Foco group and incorporated in 1974.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Gonzalez | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Focusing on the Hidden History | date=2012-01-24 | publisher= | url =http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/focusing-on-the-hidden-history/

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4502">{{for|the medical term|Entoptic phenomenon}}

In archaeology, the term '''entoptic phenomena''' relates to visual experiences derived from within the eye or brain (as opposed to externally, as in normal vision). In this respect they differ slightly from the medical definition, which defines entoptic phenomena as only applying to sources within the eye, not the brain. To avoid this confusion, the term '''subjective visual phenomena''' is sometimes used. ''Entoptic'' was chosen by author David Lewis Williams due to its origin from [[Greek language|Greek]] meaning "coming from within".&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a great deal of work trying to find evidence of motifs and compositions derived from entoptic phenomena in [[prehistoric art]], especially [[rock art]] and [[megalithic art]]. The justification of this research is that entoptic phenomena normally occur during [[Altered state of consciousness|states of altered consciousness]], the practice of which may impact our views of ancient religious and social practice. The importance of looking outside traditional methods of research for interpreting [[prehistoric]] cultures is made more so due to the lack of abundant data which makes current cultural studies viable. "Art and the ability to comprehend it are more dependent on kinds of mental imagery and the ability to manipulate mental images than on intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

==David Lewis-Williams's system==
===Stage 1===
Experiences include [[geometric]] visual patterns such as dots, zagging lines, as well as grid patterns which are all common shapes which are universally understood by the human condition.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 121&lt;/ref&gt; These patterns and shapes can be seen without aid of [[psychotropic]] substances but under their influence the heightened effects precipitate modes of altered consciousness. Entoptic experiences differ from [[hallucination]]s in that they are a purely visual phenomenon, while hallucinations represent experience of culturally occurring themes as well as physical coming from the five senses.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage 2===
Entoptic Phenomena are interpreted in ways that can be understood, matched to objects or ideas that may be familiar in day-to-day life and may also be attributed to the individuals state such as hunger, sexual arousal, or anxiety and fear.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Placing objects in reality from base shapes seen under influence from pscychotropics which link to [[Somatic symptom disorder|somatic]] physical responses lead now to full hallucinations. The relation between the first stage entoptic image and later stage full hallucinations are not mutually exclusive, both may be present.

===Stage 3===
Stage 3 images become iconic, relating to themes from the subjects life and become linked to powerful emotional experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphor and simile give way to the belief that objects are exactly what they appear to be "subject losing insight into the differences between literal and analogical meanings"&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 128&lt;/ref&gt; These stages may not always be sequential, and all stages may not be experienced depending on the subject and of course the type of psychotropic being used.

Williams notes that altered states are and their resulting impact on human [[consciousness]] is often marginalized within state, scientific, and religious realms.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 121&lt;/ref&gt; "The contemporary Western emphasis on the supreme value of intelligence has tended to suppress certain forms of consciousness and to regard them as irrational, marginal,aberrant or even pathological and thereby to eliminate them from investigations of the deep past."&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 121&lt;/ref&gt; As with any well rounded approach to cultural or historical study, all aspects of the human condition must be explored, especially when such exploration takes us outside of our usual cultural perspective.

:* and encouraging high ethical and technical standards in the field of Christian journalism.

==Beginnings &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evangelicalpress.com/about-epa/history-of-epa/ History of EPA].&lt;/ref&gt;==
In the fall of 1947, a handful of editors met at the convention of the National Sunday School Association and began to talk about an association of evangelical editors. Dr. James DeForest Murch, editor of United Evangelical Action, took the lead and called together a [[pro tem]] committee in [[Chicago]] on May 6, 1948. Thirty-five editors met at the Congress Hotel in Chicago. They officially organized the Evangelical Press Association, adopted the doctrinal statement of the National Association of Evangelicals and wrote the statement of purpose printed above. On April 4–6, 1949, the first annual convention of the EPA met in Chicago with 103 publications represented.

In September, 1951, the association mailed the first copies of a news service to its members. It was produced by volunteers who sent out ten releases in the first five months. In 1952 it became a weekly service with a subscription rate of $10 a year. That year also the association began its newsletter, Liaison. In 1954 the association adopted a code of ethics and began an awards program.

EPA has held an annual convention each year since 1949. The conventions were held in Chicago until 1957, then moved to a different city each year after that. The conventions were held in January until 1963 when the date was changed to April or May.

As the association grew, it demanded an executive secretary to carry on the administrative work and edit the news service. This became a half-time paid position. In 1978, the job of executive secretary was changed to executive director, and the director was charged with giving vision and leadership to the organization. The news service was licensed to an independent news organization, and in 1994 the news service was sold.

==Programs and services &lt;ref&gt;lkeener 2016&lt;/ref&gt;==
Held each Spring, the annual convention is the focal point of the EPA year. The 3-day convention rotates among major cities throughout the U.S. The goal is to provide three days of learning, sharing, networking, and fellowship, as well as to conduct official association business.

EPA conventions offer speakers of national stature, the annual awards contest, the annual membership meeting and election, occasional tours, and a wide variety of workshops designed for editors, writers, graphic designers, photographers, social media managers, web content managers, and business personnel—from  beginners to veterans, and for both print and digital application.

EPA hosts two annual contests: the Awards of Excellence contest (for a publication as a whole) and the Higher Goals contest (for the individual pieces produced—writing, photography, design, etc.). 

Other programs and services include press credentials, one-on-one publication critique, scholarships for undergraduate journalism students, an ethics committee to hear complaints, webinars, a legal hotline and various member benefits and discounts from selected suppliers.

The '''Georgian Theatre Royal''' is a theatre and historic [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[Theater (structure)|playhouse]] in the market town of [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]], [[North Yorkshire]], England. It is among the oldest of Britain's extant theatres.&lt;ref name=Andrews/&gt;

==History==
It was built in 1788 by the actor-manager Samuel Butler (died 1812 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=2747-gtr&lt;/ref&gt;) and was one of his circuit of theatres, the others being located in [[Beverley]], [[Harrogate]], [[Kendal]], [[Northallerton]], [[Ripon]], [[Ulverston]] and [[Whitby]], though none of these are now open. Regular performances at the theatre continued until 1830, when performances became less frequent and in 1848 it was let as an auction house. The Georgian Theatre Royal was reopened by a non-profit trust in 1963, it was expanded in 1996 and had major restoration works, including the addition of a museum, costing £1.6 million in 2002, reopening once again in 2003.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;
August 2016 saw the opening of The Georgian Theatre Royal Experience, a small but perfectly formed museum, detailing the history of the theatre and displaying artifacts from the theatre's collection, as well as The Woodland Scene, reported to be the oldest surviving stage scenery in the world. In addition, the Paul Iles Learning Centre was reopened following extensive renovation, and now houses The Georgian Theatre Royal Youth Theatre as well as many events including volunteer open days, book groups and costume making sessions.

==Theatre building==
It is now fully restored and seats 214.  The building is [[listed building|Grade I listed]].&lt;ref name=GTR/&gt; and has hosted Georgian star [[Edmund Kean]], and other figures such as Dame [[Sybil Thorndike]], [[Joyce Grenfell]] and [[Alan Bennett]]. The venue also houses a 180-member youth theatre.
The Theatre Royal possesses the oldest known set of theatrical scenery in existence.  Known as 'The Woodland Scene', it was painted in a workshop in [[Royston, Hertfordshire]] and dates back to around 1820.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/ru5laUATRKm7PAkS5Er9Cg The Woodland Scene - theatre scenery]. ''A History of the World.'' BBC/British Museum. Accessed 9 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Judi Dench|Dame Judi Dench]] is the theatre's president and [[Hamish Ogston]] and [[Thomas Allen (baritone)|Sir Thomas Allen]] are vice-presidents.&lt;ref name=GTR/&gt;

==Closure threat==
On 1 May 2013 it launched a funding campaign to save it from closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22310360|title=Appeal to save Richmond's historic Georgian Theatre Royal|last=Youngs|first=Ian|date=28 April 2013|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was seeking to raise an initial £122,500.

'''Gotland Game Conference''' ('''GGC'''), originally '''Gotland Game Convention''' and later '''Gotland Game Awards''', is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Video game development|game development]] competition for students. The event is held annually and marks the end of the academic year for the students at the Department of Game Design at [[Campus Gotland]], [[Uppsala University]]. Here they can showcase everything that they have learned during the year to a jury consisting of professionals from the game development industry, the gaming press and academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About GGC|url=http://www.gotlandgameconference.com/2011/info/about-ggc/|website=Gotland Game Conference 2011|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable people who have been a part of the jury include [[game design]] guru [[Ernest W. Adams]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gotland Game Awards!|url=http://news.designersnotebook.com/2008_06_01_archive.html|website=The Designer's Notebook News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the father of [[MUD]]s [[Richard Bartle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GGA 2008 Jury|url=http://www.gotlandgameawards.se/gga08/?page_id=6|website=Gotland Game Awards 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GGA 2009 Jury|url=http://www.gotlandgameawards.se/gga09/jury|website=Gotland Game Awards 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Department of Game Design on Gotland, Visby, has hosted a public event for displaying student projects since at least 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://game.speldesign.uu.se/blog/revive-theme-park-2002/|title=Revive / Theme Park 2002|last=Benjaminsson|first=Ulf|date=2002-05-18|website=|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=260&amp;artikel=425019|title=Utställningen där man ska röra föremålen|last=|first=|date=2004-06-04|website=|publisher=Swedish Radio|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The event found a stable structure and was branded "'''Gotland Game Awards'''" in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Edge Magazine (October 2009)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=142-143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gotland Game Awards in EDGE Magazine!|url=http://www.gotlandgameawards.se/gga09/2009/09/16/gotland-game-awards-in-edge-magazine/|website=Gotland Game Awards 2009|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and re-branded "'''Gotland Game Conference'''" in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://game.speldesign.uu.se/blog/gotland-game-conference-2011/|title=Gotland Game Conference 2011|last=Benjaminsson|first=Ulf|date=2011-06-02|website=Department of Game Design|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://game.speldesign.uu.se/blog/what-happened-to-the-gga/|title=What happened to the GGA|last=Benjaminsson|first=Ulf|date=2011-03-25|website=Department of Game Design|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;, when a presentation track was added and the event opened to public participation. In 2017 the GGC added an international summit for game educators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gotlandgameconference.com/2017/game-educators-summit/|title=Game Educators Summit (2017)|last=Benjaminsson|first=Ulf|date=2017-02-15|website=Gotland Game Conference|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; - with the intention of annually gathering game educations from across the world to collaborate and share experiences.  

==The event==

The event can be seen as consisting of four separate parts (spanning over multiple days);

*Public presentation of student projects to an international jury of developers, designers, academics, journalists etc.
*Followed by The Gotland Game Conference + showfloor, where all student games are made available to the jury and general audience. 
**The conference + show floor is roughly [http://game.speldesign.uu.se/blog/gotland-game-conference-2011/ modeled after the Game Developers Conference], but features only a single track of lectures.
*The Award Ceremony
*The GGC Party where students, jury and faculty celebrate their work and end of the school year.

The '''Grand Opera House''', also known as the '''St. James Opera House''', is a historic theater building in [[St. James, Minnesota]], United States, completed in 1892.  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2009 for its local significance in the theme of entertainment/recreation.&lt;ref name=MNHS&gt;{{cite web |title=Grand Opera House |url=http://nrhp.mnhs.org/NRDetails.cfm?NPSNum=09001152  |work=Minnesota National Register Properties Database |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society |year=2009 |accessdate=2015-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was nominated for being the city's principal performance venue from 1892 to 1921, bringing fine performing arts like theater, music, and comedy to a modest agricultural center, as well hosting local events.&lt;ref name=Granger&gt;{{cite journal |last=Granger |first=Susan |author2=Scott Kelly |author3=Kay Grossman  |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Grand Opera House |url=http://focus.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/nrhp/text/09001152.PDF |publisher=National Park Service |date=August 1997 |accessdate=2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like many of the hundreds of opera houses built across the [[Midwestern United States]] from 1880 to 1910, the St. James opera house contains its auditorium on the upper floor, with retail space on the ground floor as a source of rental income.&lt;ref name=Granger /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3712">'''Hadisa Qurbonova''' (born February 17, 1940), sometimes known by the [[mononym]] '''Hadisa''', is a [[Tajikistan]]i poet and playwright.

==Life and career==
Qurbonova was born in [[Khavaling]], [[Kulob District]], and raised in an orphanage. In 1963 she graduated from [[Tajikistan State University]], and in 1965 from the correspondence division of the Moscow Institute of Polygraphy. In the intervening years she worked at Irfon Publishers; in 1965 she took a job with the journal ''Pioniri Tojikiston'', remaining there until 1967. She was an editor of the State Committee for Radio and Television from 1967 until 1974, in which year she became an editor for the State Committee on Polygraphy and Books. She joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1977, and the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] in 1978. Qurbonova's early poems began to appear in the 1960s. They take as their themes such subjects as love and patriotism. She has since written a number of plays as well, dealing with contemporary topics.&lt;ref name="fayllar.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fayllar.org/p-rominent-t-ajik-f-igures-of-the.html?page=32|title=Qosimov, Karim - P rominent t ajik f igures of the|website=fayllar.org|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has remained an active part of Tajikistan's literary life since the country gained its independence in 1991, appearing at literary festivals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.news.tj/en/news/known-tajik-poets-and-writers-attend-festival-book-kulob|title=Known Tajik poets and writers attend festival of book in Kulob - Tajikistan News-NA «Asia-Plus»|website=old.news.tj|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and editing the work of younger writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dilkusho.wordpress.com/2010/08/11/%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B7%D1%83-%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%B2-%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B4%D0%B8-%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%BB-%D2%B3%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80/|title=Орзу ИСОЕВ МАРДИ ЧИЛ ҲУНАР|date=11 August 2010|publisher=Wordpress.com|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was named National Poet of Tajikistan in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.president.tj/node/1699|title=Маросими супоридани мукофотҳои давлатӣ - Президенти Тоҷикистон - President of Tajikistan - Президент Таджикистана - رئيس جمهورية تاجيكستان|website=www.president.tj|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Haute couture''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|oʊ|t|_|k|uː|ˈ|tj|ʊər}}; {{IPA-fr|ot kutyʁ}}; [[French language|French]] for "high sewing" or "high dressmaking" or "high fashion") is the creation of exclusive custom-fitted [[clothing]]. ''Haute couture'' is [[high-end]] [[fashion]] that is constructed by hand from start to finish, made from high-quality, expensive, often unusual fabric and sewn with extreme attention to detail and finished by the most experienced and capable sewers - often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/education/fashion-az/haute-couture|title=Haute Couture {{!}} Fashion A-Z {{!}} BoF Education {{!}} The Business of Fashion {{!}} #BoFEducation|website=The Business of Fashion|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedapifer.com/what-is-couture-mean-fashion/|title=What Does Couture Mean- Definition and French Translation – The Dapifer|date=2017-02-04|work=THE DAPIFER|access-date=2017-06-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Couture'' translates literally from French as "dressmaking" but may also refer to fashion, sewing, or needlework&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theoddportrait.com/what-is-haute-couture/|title=What is Haute Couture made easy – The Odd Portrait|date=29 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also used as a common abbreviation of ''haute couture'' and refers to the same thing in spirit.&lt;ref name="hcn2011_what"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hautecouturenews.com/what-is-haute-couture|title=What is Haute Couture?|accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Haute'' translates literally to "high". A haute couture garment is always made for an individual client, tailored specifically for the wearer's measurements and body stance. Considering the amount of time, money, and skill allotted to each completed piece, haute couture garments are also described as having no price tag: budget is not relevant.

The term originally referred to Englishman [[Charles Frederick Worth]]'s work, produced in Paris in the mid-nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=TFE/&gt; ''[[The Dapifer]]'' notes that Worth would allow his clients to select colors, fabrics and other details before ever beginning his design process which was unheard of at the time.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; In modern France, haute couture is a protected name that may not be used except by firms that meet certain well-defined standards. However, the term is also used loosely to describe all high-fashion custom-fitted clothing whether it is produced in [[Paris]] or in other [[fashion capital]]s such as [[London]], [[Milan]], [[New York City]] or [[Tokyo]]. In either case, the term can refer to the fashion houses or [[fashion design]]ers that create exclusive and often trend-setting [[fashion]]s or to the fashions created.

== French legal status of term ==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}
In [[France]], the term ''haute couture'' is protected by law and is defined by the ''[[Paris Chamber of Commerce|Chambre de commerce et d'industrie de Paris]]'' based in [[Paris]]. The ''chambre syndicale de la haute couture'' is defined as "the regulating commission that determines which fashion houses are eligible to be true haute couture houses". Their rules state that only "those companies mentioned on the list drawn up each year by a commission domiciled at the Ministry for Industry are entitled to avail themselves" of the label ''haute couture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pauline Thomas |url=http://fashion-era.com/chambre_syndicale.htm |title=Chambre Syndicale History and Development – Fashion History |publisher=Fashion-era.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne is an association of Parisian couturiers founded in 1868 as an outgrowth of medieval guilds that regulate its members in regard to counterfeiting of styles, dates of openings for collections, number of models presented, relations with press, questions of law and taxes, and promotional activities. Formation of the organization was brought about by [[Charles Frederick Worth]]. An affiliated school was organized in 1930 called L'Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture. The school helps bring new designers to help the "couture" houses that are still present today. Since 1975, this organization has worked within the [[Fédération française de la couture|Federation Francaise, de couture, du Prêt-à-Porter des Couturiers et des Createurs de Mode]].&lt;ref&gt;Calasibetta, C., Tortora, P., &amp; Abling, B. (2002). The fairchild dictionary of fashion. (3rd ed.). New York, NY: Fairchild Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

More rigorous criteria for ''haute couture'' were established in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomsburyfashioncentral.com/products/berg-fashion-library/encyclopedia/the-berg-companion-to-fashion/haute-couture|title=Bloomsbury Fashion Central -|website=www.bloomsburyfashioncentral.com|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; To earn the right to call itself a couture house and to use the term ''haute couture'' in its advertising and any other way, members of the [[Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture]] must follow specific rules:{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
* design made-to-order for private clients, with one or more fittings;
* have a workshop (''atelier'') in [[Paris]] that employs at least fifteen staff members full-time;
* have at least twenty full-time technical people, in at least one workshop (''atelier''); and 
* present a collection of at least fifty original designs to the public every fashion season (twice, in January and July of each year), of both day and evening garments.

== Other uses of the term ==
The term "haute couture" has taken on further popular meanings referring to non-dressmaking activities, such as production of fine art, music, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashion-blog.us/2008/08/11/wuyong-dancing-in-a-haute-couture-debut/ |title=Wuyong – Dancing In A Haute Couture Debut &amp;#124; The Fashion Blog |publisher=Fashion-blog.us |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Taylor Armstrong with John Bechini (8182056569).jpg|thumb|upright|Actors in Haute couture, 2012.]]

Haute couture can be referenced back as early as the 17th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/berg-companion-to-fashion/oclc/718467384&amp;referer=brief_results|title=The Berg companion to fashion|last=Steele|first=Valerie|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Berg|isbn=9781847885630|location=Oxford [etc.]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rose Bertin]], the French fashion designer to Queen Marie Antoinette, can be credited for bringing fashion and haute couture to French culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nudelman, Z|date=2009|title=The art of couture sewing|page=2|location=London|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=1563675390|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1563675390|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors to Paris brought back clothing that was then copied by local dressmakers. Stylish women also ordered dresses in the latest Parisian fashion to serve as models.

As railroads and steamships made European travel easier, it was increasingly common for wealthy women to travel to Paris to shop for clothing and accessories. French fitters and [[dressmaker]]s were commonly thought to be the best in Europe, and real Parisian garments were considered better than local imitations.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

A {{Lang|fr|'''couturier'''}} ({{IPA-fr|ku.ty.ʁje|lang}}) is an establishment or person involved in the clothing fashion industry who makes original garments to order for private clients. A couturier may make what is known as haute couture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/couturier|title=Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a person usually hires patternmakers and machinists for garment production, and is either employed by exclusive boutiques or is self-employed.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The ''couturier'' [[Charles Frederick Worth]] (October 13, 1825 – March 10, 1895), is widely considered the father of ''haute couture'' as it is known today.&lt;ref name=TFE&gt;Claire B. Shaeffer (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=e3Sd_mikSP4C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=charles+frederick+worth+haute+couture&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mxbnS83pFJGB_QaU56WdCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=charles%20frederick%20worth%20haute%20couture&amp;f=false Couture sewing techniques] "Originating in mid- 19th-century Paris with the designs of an Englishman named Charles Frederick Worth, haute couture represents an archaic tradition of creating garments by hand with painstaking care and precision". Taunton Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline C. Kent (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=5EgJ9BwO5Q0C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=charles+frederick+worth+haute+couture&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mxbnS83pFJGB_QaU56WdCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=charles%20frederick%20worth%20haute%20couture&amp;f=false Business Builders in Fashion – Charles Frederick Worth – The Father of Haute Couture] The Oliver Press, Inc., 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Although born in [[Bourne, Lincolnshire]], England, Worth made his mark in the French fashion industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Revolutionizing how dressmaking had been previously perceived, Worth made it so the dressmaker became the artist of garnishment: a fashion designer. While he created one-of-a-kind designs to please some of his titled or wealthy customers, he is best known for preparing a portfolio of designs that were shown on live models at the House of Worth. Clients selected one model, specified colors and fabrics, and had a duplicate garment tailor-made in Worth's workshop. Worth combined individual tailoring with a standardization more characteristic of the ready-to-wear [[clothing industry]], which was also developing during this period.

Following in Worth's footsteps were [[Callot Soeurs]], [[Patou]], [[Paul Poiret|Poiret]], [[Madeleine Vionnet|Vionnet]], [[Mariano Fortuny (designer)|Fortuny]], [[Jeanne Lanvin|Lanvin]], [[Chanel]], [[Mainbocher]], [[Elsa Schiaparelli|Schiaparelli]], [[Balenciaga]], and [[Christian Dior|Dior]]. Some of these fashion houses still exist today, under the leadership of modern designers.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In the 1960s, a group of young designers who had trained under men like Dior and Balenciaga left these established ''couture'' houses and opened their own establishments. The most successful of these young designers were [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Pierre Cardin]], [[André Courrèges]], [[Ted Lapidus]], and [[Emanuel Ungaro]]. Japanese native and Paris-based [[Hanae Mori]] was also successful in establishing her own line.

[[Christian Lacroix|Lacroix]] is one of the fashion houses to have been started in the late 20th century. Other new houses have included [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]] and [[Thierry Mugler]]. Due to the high expenses of producing haute couture collections, Lacroix and Mugler have since ceased their haute couture activities.&lt;ref name="End of a fairytale: Christian Lacroix fashion house to strip down"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/dec/01/christian-lacroix-fashion-house-closure End of a fairytale: Christian Lacroix fashion house to strip down]- The Guardian. Retrieved 21 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernized haute couture shows are not designed and made to be sold, rather they are exactly what they are displayed for – for show. Instead of being constructed for the purpose of selling and making money, they are made to further the publicity, as well as perception and understanding of brand image.

For all these fashion houses, custom clothing is no longer the main source of income, often costing much more than it earns through direct sales; it only adds the aura of fashion to their ventures in [[ready-to-wear]] clothing and related [[luxury product]]s such as [[shoe]]s and [[perfume]]s, and [[licensing]] ventures that earn greater returns for the company. Excessive commercialization and profit-making can be damaging, however. Cardin, for example, licensed with abandon in the 1980s and his name lost most of its fashionable cachet when anyone could buy Cardin luggage at a discount store. It is their ready-to-wear collections that are available to a wider audience, adding a splash of glamour and the feel of haute couture to more wardrobes.&lt;ref name="Luxury"&gt;{{cite book | title=Luxury Brand Management | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | author=Chevalier, Michel | year=2012 | location=Singapore | isbn=978-1-118-17176-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fashion houses still create custom clothing for publicity, for example providing items to the television show ''[[Gossip Girl]]''.&lt;ref name="meltzer20130919"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/fashion/costume-designers-for-tv-have-a-big-impact-on-fashion.html |title=Get Me Wardrobe! |last=Meltzer |first=Marisa |date=2013-09-19 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s also featured a revolt against established fashion standards by [[Mod (subculture)|mod]]s, rockers, and [[hippies]], as well as an increasing internationalization of the fashion scene. Jet travel had spawned a [[jet set]] that partied—and shopped—just as happily in New York as in Paris. Rich women no longer felt that a Paris dress was necessarily better than one sewn elsewhere. While Paris is still pre-eminent in the fashion world, it is no longer the sole arbiter of fashion.

The '''Helena Modrzejewska National Stary Theater''' in [[Kraków]] (Polish: ''Narodowy Stary Teatr im. Heleny Modrzejewskiej'') is one of the oldest public stages in Poland and a national [[cultural institution|institution of culture]], first opened in 1781. It was named after renowned Shakespearean actress [[Helena Modjeska|Helena Modrzejewska]].

== History ==
The Theatre was created by [[Feliks Oraczewski]], a member of the Polish Parliament ([[Sejm]]), and the actor [[Mateusz Witkowski]]. On October 17, 1781 the Cracow city authorities gave Witkowski permission to ''perform comedy under the condition that he pay fifty Polish zloty a month to the municipal treasury.&lt;ref name="stary"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stary-teatr.pl/content.php?url=page/informacje-o-teatrze| title = History| publisher = Narodowy Stary Teatr im.

'''Henri Frédéric Amiel''' ({{IPA-fr|amjɛl|lang}}; 27 September 1821 – 11 May 1881) was a Swiss [[moral philosophy|moral philosopher]], poet, and critic.

==Biography==
Born in [[Geneva]] in 1821, he was descended from a [[Huguenot]] family driven to [[Switzerland]] by the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]].{{says who?|date=October 2018}}

After losing his parents at an early age, Amiel travelled widely, became intimate with the intellectual leaders of [[Europe]], and made a special study of [[German philosophy]] in [[Berlin]]. In 1849 he was appointed professor of aesthetics at the academy of Geneva, and in 1854 became professor of moral philosophy.

These appointments, conferred by the democratic party, deprived him of the support of the aristocratic party, whose patronage dominated all the culture of the city.  This isolation inspired the one book by which Amiel is still known, the ''Journal Intime'' ("Private Journal"), which, published after his death, obtained a European reputation.  It was translated into [[English language|English]] by British writer [[Mary Augusta Ward]] at the suggestion of academic [[Mark Pattison (academic)|Mark Pattison]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Valerie (1996). ''Eve's Renegades: Victorian Anti-Feminist Women Novelists.'' New York: St. Martin's Press, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although modest in volume of output, Amiel's ''Journal'' gained a sympathy that the author had failed to obtain in his life. In addition to the ''Journal'', he produced several volumes of [[poetry]] and wrote studies on [[Erasmus]], [[Madame de Stael]] and other writers. His extensive correspondence with Égérie, his muse name for Louise Wyder, was preserved and published in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Frédéric Amiel, Louise Wyder, Louis Vannieuwenborgh - 2004 Louise Wyder, " Égérie ", est l'une d'entre elles. Proche ou lointaine, elle a accompagné Amiel pendant près de trente-trois ans.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Geneva.

'''Isaac Emmanuilovich Babel''' ({{lang-rus|Исаак Эммануилович Бабель|p=ˈbabʲɪlʲ}}; {{OldStyleDate|13 July|1894|1 July}} — 27 January 1940) was a [[Russian language|Russian]] writer, journalist, playwright, literary translator, historian and [[Bolshevik]] revolutionary. He is best known as the author of ''[[Red Cavalry]]'', ''Story of My Dovecote'' and ''[[The Odessa Tales]]'' — stories from the life of [[Jew]]ish gangsters from [[Odessa]] led by Benya Krik (prototype — [[Mishka Yaponchik]]&lt;ref&gt;''Shachar M. Pinsker (2018)''. [https://books.google.ru/books?id=IZFQDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50 A Rich Brew: How Cafés Created Modern Jewish Culture]. — New York: [[New York University Press]], p. 50 {{ISBN|978-1479827893}}&lt;/ref&gt;). He has been acclaimed as "the greatest prose writer of Russian Jewry".&lt;ref&gt;''Neither and Both: Anthology.'' Joshua Cohen. ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'', July 6, 2007, p. B2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Babel fell victim to the [[Great Purge]]. He was arrested by the [[NKVD]] on the night of 15 May 1939. After confessing under interrogation to being a [[Trotskyism|trotskyist]] terrorist and a foreign spy, he was shot on 27 January 1940.

==Early years==
[[File:Myasoyidivska Street.jpg|thumb|200px|Buildings in the Moldovanka quarter of Odessa.]]
[[File:Isaac Babel 1908.jpg|thumb|left|Isaac Babel in 1908.]]
Isaac Babel was born in the [[Moldavanka]] section of [[Odessa]] to Manus and Feyga Bobel. Soon after his birth, the Babel family moved to the port city of [[Mykolaiv]]. They later returned to live in a more fashionable part of Odessa in 1906. Babel used Moldavanka as the setting for ''[[The Odessa Tales]]'' and the play ''[[Sunset (play)|Sunset]]''.

Although Babel's short stories present his family as "destitute and muddle-headed", they were relatively well-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McDuff | first=David |editor-first=Isaac| editor-last=Babel |title=Red Cavalry and Other Stories |publisher=Penguin |year=1994 |pages=x-xiii |chapter=Introduction |isbn=0-14-044997-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his autobiographical statements, Babel's father, Manus, was an impoverished shopkeeper. Babel's daughter, [[Nathalie Babel Brown]], stated that her father fabricated this and other biographical details in order to "present an appropriate past for a young Soviet writer who was not a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]." In fact, Babel's father was a dealer in farm implements and owned a large warehouse.

In his teens, Babel hoped to get into the preparatory class of the [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicolas I]] Odessa Commercial School. However, he first had to overcome the [[Jewish quota]]. Despite the fact that Babel received passing grades, his place was given to another boy, whose parents had [[bribe]]d school officials.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} As a result, he was schooled at home by private tutors.

In addition to regular school subjects, Babel studied the [[Talmud]] and music. According to [[Cynthia Ozick]], &lt;blockquote&gt;"Though he was at home in [[Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew]], and was familiar with the traditional texts and their demanding commentaries, he added to these a lifelong fascination with [[Maupassant]] and [[Flaubert]]. His first stories were composed in fluent literary [[French language|French]]. The breadth and scope of his social compass enabled him to see through the eyes of peasants, soldiers, priests, rabbis, children, artists, actors, women of all classes. He befriended whores, cabdrivers, jockeys; he knew what it was like to be penniless, to live on the edge and off the beaten track."&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Isaac Babel'', page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the Jewish quota also foiled an attempt to enroll at [[Odessa University]], Babel entered the [[Kiev]] Institute of Finance and Business. There he met Yevgenia Borisovna Gronfein, daughter of a wealthy industrialist. She eventually eloped with him to Odessa.

==Early career==
[[File:Painting of maxim gorki.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Isaac Babel's friend and mentor, [[Maxim Gorky]].]]
In 1915, Babel graduated and moved to [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], in defiance of laws restricting Jews to living within the [[Pale of Settlement]]. Babel was fluent in French, besides Russian, Ukrainian and Yiddish, and his earliest works were written in French. However, none of his stories in that language have survived.

In St. Petersburg, Babel met [[Maxim Gorky]], who published some of Babel's stories in his literary magazine ''Letopis'' (''Летопись'', "Chronicle"). Gorky advised the aspiring writer to gain more life experience; Babel wrote in his autobiography, "... I owe everything to that meeting and still pronounce the name of Alexey Maksimovich Gorky with love and admiration." One of his most famous semi-autobiographical short stories, "The Story of My Dovecote" (''История моей голубятни'', ''Istoriya moey golubyatni''), was dedicated to Gorky.

The story "The Bathroom Window" was considered obscene by censors, and Babel was charged with violating criminal code article 1001.{{when|date=January 2015}}

There is very little information about Babel's whereabouts during and after the [[October Revolution]]. According to one of his stories, "The Road" ("''Дорога''", "''Doroga''"), he served on the Romanian front until early December 1917. He resurfaced in Petrograd in March 1918 as a reporter for Gorky's [[Menshevik]] newspaper, ''Novaya zhizn'' (''Новая жизнь'', "''New Life''"). Babel continued publishing there until ''Novaya zhizn'' was forcibly closed on Lenin's orders in July 1918.

Babel later recalled, &lt;blockquote&gt;"My journalistic work gave me a lot, especially in the sense of material. I managed to amass an incredible number of facts, which proved to be an invaluable creative tool. I struck up friendships with morgue attendants, criminal investigators, and government clerks. Later, when I began writing fiction, I found myself always returning to these 'subjects', which were so close to me, in order to put character types, situations, and everyday life into perspective. Journalistic work is full of adventure."&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Isaac Babel," page 486.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==October's Withered Leaves==
During the [[Russian Civil War]], which led to the Party's monopoly on the printed word, Babel worked for the publishing house of the Odessa Gubkom (regional [[CPSU]] Committee), in the food procurement unit (see his story "Ivan-and-Maria"), in the ''Narkompros'' (Commissariat of Education), and in a typographic printing office.

After the end of the Civil War, Babel worked as a reporter for ''The Dawn of the Orient'' (Заря Востока) a Russian-language newspaper published in [[Tbilisi]]. In one of his articles, he expressed regret that Lenin's controversial [[New Economic Policy]] had not been more widely implemented.

Babel married Yevgenia Gronfein on August 9, 1919, in Odessa. In 1929, their marriage produced a daughter, Nathalie Babel Brown, who grew up to become a scholar and editor of her father's life and work. By 1925, the Babels' marriage was souring. Yevgenia Babel, feeling betrayed by her husband's infidelities and motivated by her increasing [[anti-communism|hatred of communism]], emigrated to [[France]]. Babel saw her several times during his visits to [[Paris]]. During this period, he also entered into a long-term romantic relationship with Tamara Kashirina. Together, they had a son, Emmanuil Babel, who was later adopted by his stepfather [[Vsevolod Ivanov]]. Emmanuil's name was changed to Mikhail Ivanov, and he later became a noted artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pseudology.org/babel/BabelSonIvanov.htm|title=babel son painter Ivanov|website=www.pseudology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the final break with Tamara, Babel briefly attempted to reconcile with Yevgenia and they had their daughter Natalie in 1929. In 1932, Babel met a [[Siberian]]-born [[Gentile]] named [[Antonina Pirozhkova]] (1909–2010). In 1934, after Babel failed to convince his wife to return to Moscow, he and Antonina began living together. In 1939, their [[common law marriage]] produced a daughter, Lydia Babel.&lt;ref&gt;William Grimes, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/world/europe/23pirozhkova.html?_r=1&amp;ref=obituaries Antonina Pirozhkova, Engineer and Widow of Isaac Babel, Dies at 101]," ''New York Times'', September 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Pirozhkova, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Before I met Babel, I used to read a great deal, though without any particular direction. I read whatever I could get my hands on. Babel noticed this and told me, 'Reading that way will get you nowhere. You won't have time to read the books that are truly worthwhile. There are about a hundred books that every educated person needs to read. Sometime I'll try to make you a list of them.' And a few days later he brought me a list. There were ancient writers on it, Greek and Roman — [[Homer]], [[Herodotus]], [[Lucretius]], [[Suetonius]] — and also all the classics of later European literature, starting with [[Erasmus]], [[Rabelais]], [[Cervantes]], [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], and [[Charles De Coster|Coster]], and going on to 19th century writers such as [[Stendhal]], [[Mérimée]], and [[Flaubert]]."&lt;ref&gt;Antonina Pirozhkova, ''At His Side: The Last Years of Isaac Babel'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''Red Cavalry''==
[[File:Polish-soviet propaganda poster 1920.jpg|thumb|[[Soviet propaganda]] poster. Text reads: "This is how the Polish lords'&lt;!--the Polish word ''[http://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/pan pan]'' was used in Russian as a derogatory reference to Polish rich classes --&gt; ideas end."]]
[[File:Semyon Budyonny.jpg|thumb|left|Marshal [[Semyon Budyonny]]]]
In 1920, Babel was assigned to Komandarm (Army Commander) [[Semyon Budyonny]]'s [[1st Cavalry Army]], witnessing a military campaign of the [[Polish-Soviet War]] of 1920. Poland was not alone in its newfound opportunities and troubles. Virtually all of the newly independent neighbours began fighting over borders: [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] fought with [[Hungary]] over [[Transylvania]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] with [[Italy]] over [[Rijeka]], and Poland with [[Czechoslovakia]] over [[Cieszyn Silesia]], with Germany over [[Poznań]], and [[Polish-Ukrainian War|with Ukrainians]] over [[Eastern Galicia]] (Galician War). He documented the horrors of the war he witnessed in the ''[[1920 Diary]]'' (''Конармейский Дневник 1920 года'', ''Konarmeyskiy Dnevnik 1920 Goda''), which he later used to write ''[[Red Cavalry]]'' (''Конармия'', ''Konarmiya''), a collection of short stories such as "Crossing the River Zbrucz" and "My First Goose". The horrific violence of ''Red Cavalry'' seemed to harshly contrast the gentle nature of Babel himself.

Babel wrote: "Only by 1923 I have learned how to express my thoughts in a clear and not very lengthy way. Then I returned to writing." Several stories that were later included in ''Red Cavalry'' were published in [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]]'s ''[[LEF (journal)|LEF]]'' ("ЛЕФ") magazine in 1924. Babel's honest description of the brutal realities of war, far from revolutionary [[propaganda]], earned him some powerful enemies. According to recent research, Marshal Budyonny was infuriated by Babel's unvarnished descriptions of marauding Red Cossacks and demanded Babel's execution without success.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Rayfield]], ''[[Stalin and His Hangmen]]'', page 217&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gorky's influence not only protected Babel but also helped to guarantee publication. In 1929 ''Red Cavalry'' was translated into English by J. Harland and later was translated into a number of other languages.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Companion to English Literature, 6th Edition. Edited by Margaret Drabble, Oxford University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Argentine author and essayist [[Jorge Luis Borges]] once wrote of ''Red Cavalry'', &lt;blockquote&gt;The music of its style contrasts with the almost ineffable brutality of certain scenes. One of the stories, -- "Salt" -- enjoys a glory seemingly reserved for poems and rarely attained by prose: many people know it by heart.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Luis Borges, ''Selected Nonfictions'', page 164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''Odessa Tales''==
[[File:Babel photo01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Babel, 1930s.]]
[[File:Benya Krik.jpg|thumb|right|Benya Krik as portrayed by [[Yuri Shumsky]] in the 1926 movie of the same name.]]
Back in Odessa, Babel started to write the ''[[Odessa Tales]]'', a series of short stories set in the Odessan [[ghetto]] of [[Moldavanka]]. At their core, the stories describe the life of Jewish gangsters, both before and after the [[October Revolution]]. Many of them directly feature the fictional [[mob boss]] [[Benya Krik]], who remains one of the great [[anti-hero]]es of [[Russian literature]]. These stories were later used as the basis for the stage play ''[[Sunset (play)|Sunset]]'', which centers on Benya Krik's self-appointed mission to right the wrongs of Moldavanka. First on his list is to rein in his alcoholic, womanizing father, Mendel.

According to Nathalie Babel Brown, &lt;blockquote&gt;"''Sunset'' premiered at the [[Baku]] Worker's Theatre on October 23, 1927 and played in [[Odessa]], [[Kiev]], and the celebrated [[Moscow Art Theatre]]. The reviews, however, were mixed. Some critics praised the play's 'powerful anti-[[bourgeois]] stance and its interesting 'fathers and sons' theme. But in [[Moscow]], particularly, critics felt that the play's attitude toward the bourgeoisie was contradictory and weak. ''Sunset'' closed, and was dropped from the repertoire of the [[Moscow Art Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Complete Works of Isaac Babel," pages 753-754.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, ''Sunset'' continued to have admirers. In a 1928 letter to his [[White emigre]] father, [[Boris Pasternak]] wrote, "Yesterday, I read ''Sunset'', a play by Babel, and almost for the first time in my life I found that Jewry, as an ethnic fact, was a phenomenon of positive, unproblematic importance and power... I should like you to read this remarkable play..."&lt;ref&gt;''Boris Pasternak: Family Correspondence, 1921-1960'', Translated by Nicholas Pasternak Slater. [[Hoover Press]], 2011. Page 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Pirozhkova, filmmaker [[Sergei Eisenstein]] was also an admirer of ''Sunset'' and often compared it to the writings of [[Émile Zola]] for, "illuminating capitalist relationships through the experience of a single family." Eisenstein was also quite critical of the Moscow Art Theatre, "for its weak staging of the play, particularly for failing to convey to the audience every single word of its unusually terse text."&lt;ref&gt;''At His Side'', page 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glory days==
According to Nathalie Babel Brown, &lt;blockquote&gt;"The young writer burst upon the literary scene and instantly became the rage in [[Moscow]]. The tradition in Russia being to worship poets and writers, Babel soon became one of the happy few, a group that included Soviet writers who enjoyed exceptional status and privileges in an otherwise impoverished and despotic country. In the late 1930s, he was given a villa in the writer's colony of [[Peredelkino]], outside Moscow. No secret was ever made of his having a wife and daughter in [[Paris]]. At the same time, hardly anyone outside of Moscow knew of two other children he had fathered. As a matter of fact, Babel had many secrets, lived with many ambiguities and contradictions, and left many unanswered questions behind him."&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Isaac Babel'', page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Clashes with the authorities==
In 1930, Babel travelled in [[Ukraine]] and witnessed the brutality of [[collectivization in the Soviet Union|forced collectivisation]] and [[dekulakisation]]. Although he never made a public statement about this, he privately confided in Antonina, &lt;blockquote&gt;"The bounty of the past is gone -- it is due to the [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]] and the destruction of the village across our land."&lt;ref&gt;Antonina Pirozhkova, "At His Side; The Last Years of Isaac Babel," page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Stalin tightened his grip on the Soviet [[intelligentsia]] and decreed that all writers and artists must conform to [[socialist realism]], Babel increasingly withdrew from public life. During the campaign against "[[Formalism (philosophy)|Formalism]]", Babel was publicly denounced for low productivity. At the time, many other Soviet writers were terrified and frantically rewrote their past work to conform to Stalin's wishes. However, Babel was unimpressed and confided in his protégé, the writer [[Ilya Ehrenburg]], "In six months time, they'll leave the formalists in peace and start some other campaign."&lt;ref&gt;Ilya Ehrenburg, "Memoirs, 1921-1941," page 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the first congress of the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] (1934), Babel noted ironically, that he was becoming "the master of a new literary genre, the genre of silence."  American [[Max Eastman]] describes Babel's increasing reticence as an artist in a chapter called "The Silence of Isaac Babyel" in his 1934 book ''Artists in Uniform''.&lt;ref&gt;Max Eastman, ''Artists in Uniform:  A Study of Literature and Bureaucratism'', (New York:  Alfred A. Knopf, 1934) pp. 101-103&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Maria''==
Babel's play ''[[Maria (play)|Maria]]'' candidly depicts both [[political corruption]], prosecution of the innocent, and [[black market]]eering within Soviet society. Noting the play's implicit rejection of [[socialist realism]], [[Maxim Gorky]] accused his friend of having a "[[Baudelaire]]an predilection for rotting meat." Gorky further warned his friend that "political inferences" would be made "that will be personally harmful to you."&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Isaac Babel'', page 754.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pirozhkova, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Once Babel went to the [[Moscow Art Theater]] when his play ''Mariya'' was being given its first reading, and when he returned home he told me that all the actresses had been impatient to find out what the leading female role was like and who would be cast in it. It turned out that there was no leading female character present on the stage in this play. Babel thought that the play had not come off well, but it should be noted that he was always critical of his own work."&lt;ref&gt;Antonina Pirozhkova, ''At His Side; The Last Years of Isaac Babel'', Steerforth Press, 1996. Page 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Although intended to be performed in 1935, the ''Maria'''s performance was cancelled by the [[NKVD]] during rehearsals. Despite its popularity in the West, ''Maria'' was not performed in Russia until after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

[[Carl Weber (theatre director)|Carl Weber]], a former disciple of [[Bertolt Brecht]], directed ''Maria'' at [[Stanford University]] in 2004.
According to Weber, &lt;blockquote&gt;"The play is very controversial. [It] shows the stories of both sides clashing with each other during the [[Russian Civil War]] — the [[Bolshevik]]s and the [[Russian nobility|old society members]] — without making a judgment one way or another. Babel’s opinion on either side is very ambiguous, but he does make the statement that what happened after the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] may not have been the best thing for [[Russia]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2004/2/26/babelsMariaMakesUsDebutAtPigott Maria's American Debut] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060915231505/http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2004/2/26/babelsMariaMakesUsDebutAtPigott |date=September 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Paris==
In 1932, after numerous requests, he was permitted to visit his estranged wife Yevgenia in [[Paris]]. While visiting his wife and their daughter Nathalie, Babel agonized over whether or not to return to Soviet Russia. In conversations and letters to friends, he expressed a longing of being "a free man," while also expressing fear at no longer being able to make a living solely through writing. On July 27, 1933, Babel wrote a letter to [[Yuri Annenkov]], stating that he had been summoned to Moscow and was leaving immediately.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Isaac Babel'', page 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Babel's common-law wife, Antonina Pirozhkova, recalled this era, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Babel remained in France for so long that it was rumored in Moscow that he was never returning. When I wrote to him about this, he wrote back saying, 'What can people, who do not know anything, possibly say to you, who knows everything?' Babel wrote from France almost daily. I accumulated many letters from him during his 11-month absence. When Babel was arrested in 1939, all of these letters were confiscated and never returned to me."&lt;ref&gt;'"At His Side'', pages 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After his return to Russia, Babel decided to move in with Pirozhkova, beginning a [[common law marriage]] which would ultimately produce a daughter, Lidya Babel. He also collaborated with [[Sergei Eisenstein]] on the film ''[[Bezhin Meadow]]'', about [[Pavlik Morozov]], a child informant for the [[Soviet secret police]]. Babel also worked on the screenplays for several other Stalinist propaganda films.

==Escape clause==
According to Nathalie Babel Brown, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Babel came to Paris in the summer of 1935, as part of the delegation of Soviet writers to the [[International Congress of Writers]] for the Defense of Culture and Peace. He probably knew this would have been his last chance to remain in [[Europe]]. As he had done numerous times during the last ten years, he asked my mother to return with him to Moscow. Although he knew the general situation was bad, he nevertheless described to her the comfortable life that the family could have there together. It was the last opportunity my mother had to give a negative answer, and she never forgot it. Perhaps it helped her later on to be proven completely right in her fears and her total lack of confidence in the [[Soviet Union]]. My mother described to me these last conversations with my father many times."&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Isaac Babel'', pages 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Relationship with the Yezhovs==
[[File:Isaac Babel.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Isaac Babel, 1937.]]
During a visit to [[Berlin]], the married Babel began an affair with [[Yevgenia Yezhov|Yevgenia Feigenberg]], who was then a translator at the Soviet embassy. [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]] has dubbed Yevgenia an "irrepressible literary [[groupie]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], ''Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar'', page 266.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Babel's interrogation transcripts, she began her seduction of the writer with the words, "You don't know me, but I know you well."&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitaly Shentalinsky]], ''The KGB's Literary Files'', page 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Even after Yevgenia married [[NKVD]] boss [[Nikolai Yezhov|N. I. Yezhov]] the affair continued and Babel frequently presided over Mrs. Yezhov's literary gatherings, which often included such luminaries as [[Solomon Mikhoels]], [[Leonid Utesov]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]], and [[Mikhail Koltsov]]. On one such occasion, Babel was heard to say, "Just think, our girl from [[Odessa]] has become the first lady of the kingdom!"&lt;ref&gt;''ibid'', page 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her memoirs, Antonina professes complete ignorance of her common law husband's affair with Mrs. Yezhov. Babel informed her that his interest in the Yezhovs was, "purely professional," and was tied to his desire to understand the Party elite.&lt;ref&gt;''At His Side'', pages 104-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

In retaliation for Babel's affair with his wife, Yezhov ordered the writer placed under constant NKVD surveillance. As the [[Great Purge]] began during the late 1930s, Yezhov was informed that Babel was spreading rumors about the suspicious death of [[Maxim Gorky]] and alleging that his former mentor had been murdered on orders from Stalin. Babel had also been heard to say of [[Leon Trotsky]], "It's impossible to imagine the charm and strength of his influence on anyone who encounters him."&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Rayfield]], ''Stalin and His Hangmen'', [[Random House]], 2004. Page 326-327.&lt;/ref&gt; Babel further commented that [[Lev Kamenev]] was, "...the most brilliant connoisseur of language and literature."&lt;ref&gt;''Stalin and His Hangmen'', page 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the number of Purge victims skyrocketed, however, Nikolai Yezhov's overenthusiastic pursuit of suspected "enemies" began to be thought a liability by Stalin and his inner circle. In response, [[Lavrentiy Beria|Lavrenti Beria]] was assigned as Yezhov's assistant and swiftly usurped the leadership of the NKVD.

According to Montefiore, &lt;blockquote&gt;"The darkness began to descend upon Yezhov's family where his silly, sensual wife was unwittingly to play the terrible role of [[Latrodectus|black widow spider]]: most of her lovers were to die. She herself was too sensitive a flower for Yezhov's world. Both she and Yezhov were promiscuous but by then they lived in a world of high tension, dizzy power over life and death, and dynamic turmoil as men rose and fell around them. If there was justice in Yezhov's fall, it was a tragedy for Yevgenia and little Natasha, to whom he was a kind father. A pall fell on Yevgenia's literary [[Salon (gathering)|salon]]. When a friend walked her home to the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] after a party, she herself reflected that Babel was in danger because he had been friends with arrested Trotskyite generals: 'Only his European fame could save him.' She herself was in greater danger."&lt;ref&gt;''Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar'', page 281.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Arrest==
[[File:Babel NKWD.png|left|thumb|250px|The [[NKVD]] photo of Babel taken after his arrest]]

On May 15, 1939, Antonina Pirozhkova was awakened by four [[NKVD]] agents pounding upon the door of their Moscow apartment. Although surprised, she agreed to accompany them to Babel's dacha in [[Peredelkino]]. Babel was then placed under arrest. According to Pirozhkova: "In the car, one of the men sat in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. 'The worst part of this is that my mother won't be getting my letters', and then he was silent for a long time. I could not say a single word. Babel asked the secret policeman sitting next to him, 'So I guess you don't get too much sleep, do you?' And he even laughed. As we approached [[Moscow]], I said to Babel, 'I'll be waiting for you, it will be as if you've gone to [[Odessa]]... only there won't be any letters....' He answered, 'I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.' "But I don't know what my destiny will be." At this point, the man sitting beside Babel said to me, "We have no claims whatsoever against you." We drove to the [[Lubyanka (KGB)|Lubyanka Prison]] and through the gates. The car stopped before the massive, closed door where two sentries stood guard. Babel kissed me hard and said, "Someday we'll see each other..." And without looking back, he got out of the car and went through that door.&lt;ref&gt;''At His Side'', page 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Nadezhda Mandelstam]], Babel's arrest became the subject of an [[urban legend]] within the [[NKVD]]. NKVD agents, she explains, were fond of "telling stories about the risks they ran" in arresting "enemies of the people". Babel had, according to NKVD lore, "seriously wounded one of our men" while "[[resisting arrest]]". Mrs. Mandelstam contemptuously declared, "Whenever I hear such tales I think of the tiny hole in the skull of Isaac Babel, a cautious, clever man with a high forehead, who probably never once in his life held a pistol in his hands."&lt;ref&gt;Nadezhda Mandelstam (1999), ''Hope Against Hope'', [[Modern Library]]. Pages 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution==
According to Peter Constantine, from the day of his arrest, Isaac Babel "became a [[nonperson]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. His name was blotted out, removed from literary dictionaries and encyclopedias, and taken off school and university syllabi. He became unmentionable in any public venue. When the film director [[Mark Donskoi]]'s famous Gorky trilogy premiered the following year, Babel, who had worked on the [[screenplay]], had been removed from the credits."&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Isaac Babel'', page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his file, "Case #419, Babel, I.E.", the writer was held at the Lubyanka and Butyrka Prisons for a total of eight months as a case was built against him for Trotskyism, terrorism, and spying for Austria and France. At his initial interrogations, "Babel began by adamantly denying any wrongdoing, but then after three days he suddenly 'confessed' to what his interrogator was suggesting and named many people as co-conspirators. In all likelihood, he was tortured, almost certainly beaten."&lt;ref&gt;Pirozhkova (1996), page ''xxix''.&lt;/ref&gt; His interrogators included [[Boris Rodos]], who had a reputation as a particularly brutal torturer, even by the standards of the time, and Lev Schwartzmann, who tortured the renowned theatre director, [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shentalinsky |title=The KGB's Literary Archive |pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those he accused of conspiring with him were his close friends [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Solomon Mikhoels]], and [[Ilya Ehrenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Pirozhkova (1996), page ''xxxii''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite months of pleading and letters sent directly to Beria, Babel was denied access to his unpublished manuscripts. In October 1939, Babel was again summoned for interrogation and denied all his previous testimony. A statement was recorded, "I ask the inquiry to take into account that, though in prison, I committed a crime. I slandered several people."&lt;ref&gt;''At His Side'', page xxx.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to further delays as the NKVD frantically attempted to salvage their cases against Mikhoels, Ehrenburg, and Eisenstein.

|}
On 16 January 1940, Beria presented Stalin with a list of 457 'enemies of the party and the soviet regime' who were in custody, with a recommendation that 346, including Isaac Babel should be shot. According to Babel's daughter, Nathalie Babel Brown, his trial took place on January 26, 1940, in one of [[Lavrenti Beria]]'s private chambers. It lasted about twenty minutes. The sentence had been prepared in advance and without ambiguity: death by [[firing squad]], to be carried out immediately. He was shot at 1.30 am on 27 January 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shentalinsky |title=The KGB's Literary Archive |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babel's last recorded words in the proceedings were, 'I am innocent. I have never been a spy. I never allowed any action against the [[Soviet Union]]. I accused myself falsely. I was forced to make false accusations against myself and others... I am asking for only one thing—let me finish my work.' He was shot the next day and his body was thrown into a [[Mass graves in the Soviet Union|communal grave]]. All of this information was revealed in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Isaac Babel'', pages 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], Babel's ashes were buried with those of [[Nikolai Yezhov]] and several other victims of the [[Great Purge]] in a common grave at the [[Donskoy Cemetery]]. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], a plaque was placed there which reads, "Here lie buried the remains of the innocent, tortured, and executed victims of political repressions. May they never be forgotten."&lt;ref&gt;''Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar'', page 324.&lt;/ref&gt; The grave of Yevgenia Yezhov, who committed suicide in a mental institution, lies less than twenty paces away.

According to the early official Soviet version, Isaac Babel died in the [[Gulag]] on March 17, 1941. [[Peter Constantine]], who translated Babel's complete writings into English, has described the writer's execution as "one of the great tragedies of 20th century literature."&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Isaac Babel'', page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rehabilitation==
On December 23, 1954, during the [[Khrushchev Thaw|Khrushchev thaw]], a typed half sheet of paper ended the official silence. It read, &lt;blockquote&gt;"The sentence of the military collegium dated 26 January 1940 concerning Babel, I.E., is revoked on the basis of newly discovered circumstances and the case against him is terminated in the absence of elements of a crime."&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Isaac Babel'', page 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Babel's works were once again widely published and praised. His public rehabilitation as a writer was initiated with the help of his friend and admirer [[Konstantin Paustovsky]], and a volume of Babel's selected works was published in 1957 with a laudatory preface by [[Ilya Ehrenburg]]. New collections of selected works by Babel were published in 1966, 1989 and 1990. Still, certain "[[taboo]]" parts such as mentions of [[Trotsky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ogoniok.com/5071/13/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215184908/http://www.ogoniok.com/5071/13/ |archivedate=2009-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; were censored until the [[glasnost]] period shortly before the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. The first collections of the complete works of Babel were prepared and published in Russia in 2002 and 2006.

==Lost writings==
[[File:Sholom Aleichem listens.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sholem Aleichem]], whose writings Babel translated into Russian.]]
After his rehabilitation, Antonina Pirozhkova spent almost five decades campaigning for the return of Babel's manuscripts. These included Babel's translations of [[Sholem Aleichem]]'s writings from [[Yiddish]] into Russian, as well as several unpublished short stories and novellas. According to Pirozhkova, &lt;blockquote&gt;As Babel put it, he worked on Sholem Aleichem to "feed his soul." Other "food for the soul" came from writing new stories and the novella "Kolya Topuz." He told me, "I'm writing a novella in which the main character is a former Odessa gangster like [[Benya Krik|Benia Krik]]. His name is Kolya Topuz and so far, at least, that's also the name of the novella. I want to show how this sort of man adapts to Soviet reality. Kolya Topuz works on a collective farm during collectivization, and then he goes to work in a [[Donbass]] coal mine. But since he has the mentality of a gangster, he's constantly breaking out of the limits of normal life, which leads to numerous funny situations." Babel spent a great deal of time writing, and he finished many works. Only his arrest prevented his new works from coming out."&lt;ref&gt;''At His Side'', page 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, even requests by [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] produced no answers from the Soviet State. The truth was not revealed until the advent of [[Perestroika]].

According to Pirozhkova, &lt;blockquote&gt;"In 1987, when so much was changing in our country, I again made an official request that the [[KGB]] search for Babel's manuscripts in its underground storage areas. In response to my request, I was visited by two KGB agents who informed me that the manuscripts had been burned. 'And so you've come in person to avoid giving me a written response to my request, am I correct?' 'How could you think such a thing? We came here to commiserate. We understand how precious Babel's manuscripts would be.'"&lt;ref&gt;''At His Side'', page 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Ilya Ehrenburg Russian writer.jpg|thumb|upright|Soviet author and former Babel protégé [[Ilya Ehrenburg]].]]
After her husband's return to Moscow in 1935, Yevgenia Gronfein Babel remained unaware of his other family with [[Antonina Pirozhkova]]. Based upon statements made by [[Ilya Ehrenburg]], Yevgenia further believed that her husband was still alive and living in exile. In 1956, however, Ehrenburg told her of her husband's execution while visiting Paris.  After also informing Mrs. Babel of her husband's daughter with Antonina Pirozhkova, Ehrenburg asked Yevgenia to sign a false statement attesting to a pre-war divorce from her husband. Enraged, Yevgenia Babel spat in Ehrenberg's face and then fainted.

Her daughter, [[Nathalie Babel Brown]], believes that Ehrenburg did this under orders from the [[KGB]]. With two potential contenders for the role of Babel's widow, the Soviet State clearly preferred Babel's common-law wife Antonina to his legal wife Yevgenia, who had emigrated to the West.

Although Babel's play ''[[Maria (play)|Maria]]'' was very popular at Western European colleges during the 1960s, it was not performed in Babel's homeland until 1994. The first English translation appeared in 1966 in a translation by Michael Glenny in THREE SOVIET PLAYS (Penguin) under the title "Marya".  ''Maria'''s American premiere, directed by [[Carl Weber (theatre director)|Carl Weber]], took place at [[Stanford University]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Keller: [http://www.stanforddaily.com/cgi-bin/?p=1014062 Babel’s ‘Maria’ makes U.S. debut at Pigott] ''The Stanford Daily'', 27 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although she was too young to have many memories of her father, Nathalie Babel Brown went on to become one of the world's foremost scholars of his life and work. When a [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company|Norton Anthology]] of his writings was published in 2002, Nathalie edited the volume and provided a foreword. She died in [[Washington DC]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/13/arts/13babel.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1134572748-RSE5HIxeweXwnATLoTcYvQ | work=The New York Times | title=Nathalie Babel Brown, 76, Dies; Edited Isaac Babel | first=Wolfgang | last=Saxon | date=2005-12-13 | accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American writer [[Hubert Selby]] has called Babel "the closest thing I have to a literary influence."

American writer [[James Salter]] has named Babel his favorite short-story writer. "He has the three essentials of greatness: style, structure, and authority."

American writer [[George Saunders]], when asked for a literary influence said "There's a Russian writer named Isaac Babel that I love. I can drop in anywhere in his works, read a few pages, and go, Oh yeah, language. It's almost like if you were tuning a guitar and you heard a beautifully tuned one and you say, Yeah, that's what we want. We want something that perfect. When I read him, it recalibrates my ear. It reminds me of the difference between an OK sentence and a really masterful sentence. Babel does it for me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/interviews/show/1217.George_Saunders?ues=a|title=Interview with George Saunders|date=6 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Lydia Babel, the daughter of Isaac Babel and Antonina Pirozhkova, also emigrated to the [[United States]] and currently resides in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''&lt;/ref&gt;

British writer [[Bernard Kops]] wrote a poem, and later a play, about Babel: "Whatever Happened to Isaac Babel?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kessler|first1=Sarah|title=Isaac Babel's Last Days in Lubyanka|url=http://forward.com/the-assimilator/132673/isaac-babels-last-days-in-lubyanka/|accessdate=9 December 2015|work=The Forward|date=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorial in Odessa==
[[File:Памятник Исааку Бабелю (Одесса).JPG|thumb|Memorial in Odessa, sculptor {{illm|Georgy Frangulyan|ru|Георгий Франгулян}}]]
A memorial to Isaac Babel was unveiled on the north-west corner of the intersection of (V)ulitsa Rishelyevskaya and (V)ulitsa Zhukovskogo in Odessa in early September 2011, and, in conjunction with the inauguration of the memorial, a commemorative reading of three of his stories held, with musical interludes from the works of [[Isaac Schwartz]], in the Philharmonic Hall in (V)ulitsa Pushkinskaya on September 6, 2011. The city also has an already existing (V)ulitsa Babelya ("Babel Street") in the Moldavanka.

'''''It's Garry Shandling's Show''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[sitcom]] that was initially broadcast on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] from 1986 to 1990. It was created by [[Garry Shandling]] and [[Alan Zweibel]]. The series is notable for breaking the [[fourth wall]].

==Synopsis==
The 30-minute series stars [[Garry Shandling]] as, more or less, himself: A [[Neurosis|neurotic]], somewhat self-obsessed [[stand-up comedian]] who just happens to be aware he is a television sitcom character. Garry spends just as much time interacting with the studio audience as he does the regular cast members, offering up opening [[monologue]]s and show-closing summations of the episode's events (much like [[George Burns]] on ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]'').  However, on Garry's show, all the supporting characters know they are on a TV show, not just Garry; and the studio audience is often in the storyline.

At the time of the series' production, Shandling actually lived in [[Sherman Oaks, California]], just like the character on the series. His [[condominium]] on the series was styled to be just like his real-life condo, down to the room layout and the furnishings.&lt;ref&gt;DVD commentary from ''It's Garry Shandling's Show'', Season 3, Episode 46, "Garry Acts Like A Moron"&lt;/ref&gt;

Storylines were often manipulated by Shandling to create more favorable outcomes or simply to speed things along. One episode ended years later, for example. Another allowed Shandling to tell the audience that time had passed in order to console an angry neighbor whose wall he had damaged; by the time the scene transitioned, the workmen had already fixed the wall. On America's presidential election night in 1988, Showtime presented a live episode wherein Shandling brought in ''[[Soul Train]]'' host [[Don Cornelius]] to incorrectly announce that [[Michael Dukakis]] had soundly defeated [[George H. W. Bush]].

The series' [[Theme music|theme song]] was "This is the Theme to Garry's Show", sung by Los Angeles musician Bill Lynch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2007/may/04/midwest_icon_bill_lynch_discovers_how_live_music/|title=Midwest icon Bill Lynch discovers how to 'live the music' |
first=Jon |last=Niccum |date=May 4, 2007 |newspaper=[[Lawrence Journal-World]] |accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song's lyrics are self-referential, explaining how the song came to be ("Garry called me up and asked if I would write his theme song") and asking what the listener thinks of it.

Considered a critical and [[Niche market|niche]] success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.museum.tv/eotv/itsgarrysh.htm |title=Encyclopedia of Television - It's Garry Shandling's Show/The Larry Sanders Show |work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |year=2013 |accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''It's Garry Shandling's Show'' ran 72 episodes and was on the air for four seasons (1986–1990). The show was later picked up by the broadcast [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network from 1988 to 1990 as part of its Sunday night lineup with minor cuts for language and advertising breaks; Fox began airing the show from the beginning, but due to longer seasons for network shows versus [[Cable television|cable]], had caught up by the time the show left Fox in March 1990. New episodes continued for a few months thereafter on Showtime. The show introduced much of the country to Shandling and paved the way for his more successful run as Larry Sanders on [[HBO]]'s ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''.

==Cast and characters==
Throughout the series, the cast was divided into the "Starring" cast, whose names were featured in the opening credits; the "Co-Starring" cast and the "Guest Starring" cast, both of which had the actors' names featured in the end credits.
===Starring===
* [[Garry Shandling]] as Garry Shandling - Immature star / host of the show. Constantly obsessed with his hair.
* [[Geoffrey Blake (actor)|Geoffrey Blake]] as Lewis (early season 1) - Garry's ladies' man best friend. Dropped from the series after the first run of six episodes.
* [[Molly Cheek]] as Nancy Bancroft - Garry's "attractive, but non-threatening, platonic neighbor."
* [[Jessica Harper]] as Phoebe Bass (season 4) - Garry's girlfriend and eventual wife.
* Scott Nemes as Grant Schumaker - Garry's neighbor, son of Pete and Jackie Schumaker.
* [[Michael Tucci]] as Pete Schumaker - Garry's close friend and neighbor. Father of Grant and husband of Jackie. Very nerdy and clumsy. Leads his son's Cub Scout troop.

===Co-starring===

* [[Paul Willson]] as Leonard Smith (mid-season 1 through season 4, recurring guest early season 1) - The president of the condo association that Garry lives in, who frequently drops by uninvited so that he can end up on-camera on Garry's show. He is a nuisance to Garry and his friends.

While fighting [[ovarian cancer]], [[Gilda Radner]] guest-starred as herself in the series in 1988 in what would be her final television appearance. When Shandling asked her why she had not been seen on television for a while, Radner replied, "Oh, I had cancer. What did ''you'' have?"

[[File:Access Virus TI.jpg|thumb|Access Virus TI Polar Keyboard]]

A '''keyboardist''' or '''keyboard player''' is a [[musician]] who plays [[keyboard instrument]]s. Until the early 1960s musicians who played keyboards were generally classified as either [[piano|pianists]] or [[organ (music)|organists]].  Since the mid-1960s, a plethora of new musical instruments with keyboards have come into common usage, requiring a more general term for a person who plays them. These keyboards include:

*[[electric piano]]s such as the [[Fender Rhodes]] and [[Wurlitzer electric piano]]
*[[electronic piano]]s such as the [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] Digital Piano
*[[Hammond organ|Hammond]] and other [[electronic organ|electric organ]]s such as the [[Farfisa]] and [[Vox Continental]]
*[[analog synthesizer]]s such as [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]], [[ARP Instruments, Inc.|ARP]], and units produced by a variety of other manufacturers such as [[Alesis]].
*[[Analog modeling synthesizer]]s produced by such companies as [[Alesis]], and [[Novation Digital Music Systems|Novation]]
*digital keyboard workstations such as those produced today by [[Roland Corporation|Roland]], [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]], [[Kurzweil Music Systems|Kurzweil]] and [[Korg]]
*[[sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]]s
*[[Mellotron]]
*[[MIDI keyboard]]
*[[clavinet]]
*[[Continuum (instrument)|continuum]]
*[[melodica]]
*[[pianet]]
*[[piano]] (see [[pianist]] for a list of famous pianists)
*[[harpsichord]]
*[[reed organ]]
*[[celesta]]
*[[clavichord]]
*[[pipe organ]]
*[[pump organ|harmonium]]
*[[keytar]]
*kimophone (keytar horn invented by Kimo Lobo)

==Notable electronic keyboardists==

There are many famous electronic keyboardists in metal, rock, pop and jazz music. A complete list can be found at [[List of keyboardists]].

The use of electronic keyboards grew in popularity throughout the 1960s, with many bands using the Hammond organ, [[Mellotron]], and electric pianos such as the [[Fender Rhodes]]. [[The Doors]] became the first group to use the [[Moog synthesizer]] on a pop record on 1967's "[[Strange Days (The Doors song)|Strange Days]]". Other bands, including [[The Moody Blues]], [[The Rolling Stones]], and [[The Beatles]] would go on to add it to their records, both to provide [[sound effects]] and as a musical instrument in its own right. In 1966, [[Billy Ritchie (musician)|Billy Ritchie]] became the first keyboard player to take a lead role in a rock band, replacing guitar, and thereby preparing the ground for others such as [[Keith Emerson]] and [[Rick Wakeman]].&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music (Muze); The Illustrated History of Rock, [[Clouds (60s rock band)|Clouds]] by Ed Ward; Q magazine article 1996 by Martin Ashton; Mojo Magazine article '1-2-3 and the Birth of Prog' nov 1994&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s, a pioneer of modern electronic music [[Jean Michel Jarre]] started to experiment with synthesizers and other electronic devices. As synthesizers became more affordable and less unwieldy, many more bands and producers began using them, eventually paving the way for bands that consisted solely of synthesizers and other electronic instruments such as [[drum machine]]s by the late 1970s/early 1980s. Some of the first bands that used this set up were [[Kraftwerk]], [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]] and [[The Human League]]. Rock groups also began using synthesizers and electronic keyboards alongside the traditional line-up of guitar, bass and drums; particularly in [[progressive rock]] groups such as [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]] and [[Pink Floyd]].  The pop-blues-rock band [[Fleetwood Mac]] was also known for synthesizer-infused hits during this period.

Keyboardists are often highly sought after in [[cover band]]s, to replicate the original keyboard parts and other instrumental parts such as [[String section|strings]] or [[Brass section|horns]] where it would be logistically difficult to hire people to play the actual instruments.

'''La Princesse''' is a 15-metre (50-foot) mechanical [[spider]] designed and operated by French [[performance art]] company [[La Machine (production company)|La Machine]]. The spider was showcased in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], as part of the 2008 [[European Capital of Culture]] celebrations, travelling around the city between 3-7 September.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article4666717.ece|title= Huge mechanical spider to attack Liverpool|publisher=The Times Online|accessdate=2008-09-05 | location=London | first=Jenny | last=Booth | date=2008-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, it was on display in [[Yokohama]], [[Japan]], as part of Yokohama's 150th anniversary of its port opening.&lt;ref name=JapanTimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fa20090424a1.html|title=La Machine invades Yokohama!|accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arts reviewer Lyn Gardner wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' "There were times when it seemed to be leading the entire population of the city on a merry dance, like some kind of arachnid [[The Pied Piper of Hamelin|pied piper]]."&lt;ref name="Guardian2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/sep/08/theatre.europeancapitalofculture2008|title=La Machine Liverpool City Centre|last=Gardner|first=Lyn|date=2008-09-08|accessdate=2008-09-08|publisher=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

The spider was designed by La Machine's [[François Delarozière]], who also designed the mechanical elephant and the giant girl for [[Royal de Luxe]]'s performance of [[The Sultan's Elephant]] which visited London in May 2006.&lt;ref name=L08&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpool08.com/streets/LaMachine/index.asp|title=La Machine|publisher=Liverpool European Capital of Culture|accessdate=2008-09-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107125503/http://www.liverpool08.com/streets/LaMachine/index.asp|archivedate=2009-01-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PHF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phf.org.uk/page.asp?id=188|title=Paul Hamlyn Foundation Artichoke Trust L'araignée by La Machine £50,000|publisher=Paul Hamlyn Foundation|accessdate=2008-09-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912215720/http://www.phf.org.uk/page.asp?id=188|archivedate=2008-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Both projects were brought to the UK by the company and charitable trust [[Artichoke (creative company)|Artichoke]].&lt;ref name=Arti&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artichoke.uk.com/liverpool2008.htm|title= Liverpool 2008|publisher=Artichoke|accessdate=2008-09-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516081814/http://www.artichoke.uk.com/liverpool2008.htm |archivedate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The spider was built in [[Nantes]] in France, using steel and [[Populus|poplar]] wood and complex [[hydraulics]], and took an entire year to construct.

==Performance and narrative==

[[File:La Princesse on move1 2.jpg|thumb|La Princesse moving through the streets of Liverpool|alt=]]

The performance artists of La Machine created a story about the spider with one member of the company playing scientist Joseph Browning who gave interviews to the press. The spider was followed by a full live band, housed in their own platforms on top of [[Forklift|fortlift trucks]] and [[Aerial work platform|cherry pickers]]. The musicians played specially composed music by [[Dominique Malan]], the special effects were designed by [[Thierry Loridant]] and the costumes were designed by [[Gaelle Choveau]].&lt;ref name="LM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamachine.co.uk/|title=La Machine Home Introduction|publisher=La Machine|accessdate=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First appearance ===
On Wednesday 3 September the spider appeared for the first time on the side of [[Concourse House]], a derelict tower block in Lime Street, which had been designed by architect [[Richard Seifert]] and was scheduled for demolition.&lt;ref name="AJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/dailynews/2008/09/giant_spider_arrives_in_liverpool.html|title=Giant spider arrives in Liverpool|publisher=Architects Journal|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 'The journey begins' ===
On the morning of Friday 5 September, the spider moved to the [[Albert Dock]], and it became active at lunchtime, moving in a small area and spraying the public with water. In the evening the spider travelled from the Albert Dock to the [[Cunard Building]], via [[Salthouse Dock]]. A huge crowd turned out despite the heavy rain. The performance move around the [[The Royal Albert Dock Liverpool|Albert Dock]] and proceeded onto The Strand. The moving cordon of stewards surrounded the spider as it moved through the crowd. The spider sprayed water onto the crowds and interacted with members of the public. It then turned off the Strand and back into the Albert Dock. Here it paused and was lifted from its traction body by a huge crane and into Salthouse Dock, where it was sprayed (along with the crowd) by huge water cannons. After its 'bath' it returned to its traction body and walked along The Strand to its resting place for the night next to the [[Royal Liver Building|Royal]] [[Royal Liver Building|Liver Building]]. 

=== 'City centre rampage' ===
On Saturday 6 September the spider was due to travel through the streets of Liverpool, 'walking' from the [[Cunard Building]] via Water Street, Castle St, Lord St, Parker St and Ranelagh Place back up to Concourse House. At 2:30&amp;nbsp;pm the Performance started with the spider ‘awakening’ and starting to walk up [[Water Street, Liverpool|Water Street]] towards the city centre. Liverpool was crowded with its usual Saturday afternoon shopping crowd and the tens of thousands who had turned out to see the spider. The spider ‘walked’ through the middle of the Saturday shopping crowd, up through the city centre's streets, and right into the heart of the city's shopping district. The crowd was dispersed by the moving cordon around the spider. Local media reported that the scene was more representative of a victory parade of a football team or the crowds attracted by the Beatles to the city centre in their heyday.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} One bride could not get through the crowds to her wedding at the Town Hall and had to be helped through the crowd on foot by the police. The spider's musicians played an impromptu wedding march as they fought through the crowd.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Various set pieces took place along the spider's route, involving smoke, fireworks and water cannon. The spider worked its way towards the main shopping area, passing [[Liverpool One]]. When the spider reached the centre of [[Lord Street, Liverpool|Lord Street]], it was covered by a snow shower from above to make it go to sleep. It came to a rest at around 5&amp;nbsp;pm, taking a break before its further exploits that evening.

=== 'The city fights back' ===
The next chapter of the story continued the same day and involved the city ‘fighting back’ and attempting to halt the path of the invading spider. At 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm the spider ‘awoke’ and continued to move up the main shopping street, Church Street. When it reached the top of the street it was met by a barrage of flame cannons. These consisted of long copper pipes, fired with high pressure gas. The heat and noise produced by this halted the spider in its tracks, while a mechanical digger moved in to attempt to fell the beast. The spider then changed its path to escape this and moved upwards towards [[Lime Street, Liverpool|Lime Street]]. Upon reaching Lime Street the spider was met by huge fans, which blew air to attempted to hold it back. The performance continued onwards towards Lime Street Station and the empty Concourse Tower, where it had first been sighted on Wednesday. A further barrage of flames stopped the spider from moving on any further and it turned towards the station. Cranes then moved in to lift it from its traction body and, with operators still on board, it started to moved into a vertical position. The spider then moved from one crane to another and amazingly attached itself to the side of the tower. A snow shower then engulfed the spider and it went to sleep for the evening.

=== 'The creature departs' ===
On Sunday 7 September a large crowd of spectators went to the Concourse House to see it climb back down the building. The spider then crawled down the streets of Liverpool city centre, spraying the crowd with water. The spider then moved across St Georges Plateau amongst a huge crowd and down towards the [[Queensway Tunnel]]. Fireworks erupted from surrounding buildings as it passed. Watched by tens of thousands of people, it investigated the area outside the Queensway Tunnel's entrance, setting off huge water cannons and flames around the area, followed by hundreds of fireworks which detonated above the spider and the public. The spider then turned to face the crowd and moved backwards as it disappeared in a cloud of smoke into the tunnel entrance.
==Cost==

[[File:La Princesse on move2.jpg|thumb|Showing the puppeteers: three ride on top of the spider and nine under her body, one to operate each leg and one for other operations|alt=]]

The project, which was free to the public, cost between £1.8 and £1.9 million to stage, of which £1.5 million came from the Liverpool Culture Company (in turn funded by the city, the Arts Council and the [[Department of Culture, Media and Sport]]).&lt;ref name=LE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-entertainment/echo-entertainment/2008/09/08/farewell-to-1-8m-la-machine-show-as-spider-crawls-away-100252-21702105/2/|title= Farewell to £1.8m La Machine show as spider crawls away|publisher=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the project has been defended by [[Phil Redmond]], who is responsible for the performance as Liverpool Culture Company's artistic director.  He said "At £1.5m I think it's actually cheaper than (booking) Macca ([[Paul McCartney|Sir Paul McCartney]]) and it has got us on the front of the [[South China Morning Post]]. So it's good value for money."&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7599960.stm|title= Thousands watch spider 'wake up' |publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-09-05 | date=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the project has come in for criticism in some quarters: the UK mental health charity [[Anxiety (mental health charity)|Anxiety]] has highlighted the potentially traumatic effect of the production upon those suffering with [[arachnophobia]],"&lt;ref name=LDP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2008/09/05/la-machine-nightmare-for-all-arachnophobics-64375-21679200/|title= La Machine: Nightmare for all arachnophobics|publisher=Liverpool Daily Post|accessdate=2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[TaxPayers' Alliance]] has called the artwork an "outrageous waste of taxpayers' money".&lt;ref name=MOS/&gt; The vast majority of the public response was positive, however, with most of the belief that "The Liverpool Princesse's" performance was the highlight of the city's Capital of Culture 2008 celebrations. On 8 September, ''[[BBC North West Tonight]]'', a regional news programme, revealed that plans were afoot to secure La Princesse to stay permanently in Liverpool, and talks had already been held with La Machine. 

Although the event was free to the public, there has been a shortfall of between £300,000 and £400,000 in funding for the project, exacerbated by the falling exchange rate with the [[Euro]], the currency in which the French participants are paid. Artichoke has appealed for donations to help fund the project.&lt;ref name=LE/&gt;&lt;ref name=LM2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamachine.co.uk/index.php/help/|title= Help|publisher=La Machine|accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justgiving.com/artichoketrust|title= Artichoke Trust|publisher=Just Giving|accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Heraldic achievement}}
The '''law of heraldic arms''' (or laws of [[heraldry]]) governs the "bearing of arms", that is, the possession, use or display of arms, also called [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], coat armour or armorial bearings. Although it is believed that the original function of coats of arms was to enable [[knights]] to identify each other on the battlefield, they soon acquired wider, more decorative uses. They are still widely used today by countries, public and private institutions and by individuals. The earliest writer on the law of arms was [[Bartolus de Saxoferrato]]. The officials who administer these matters are called [[pursuivant]]s, [[herald]]s, or [[King of Arms|kings of arms]] (in increasing order of seniority). The law of arms is part of the law in countries which regulate heraldry, although not part of [[common law]] in England and in countries whose laws derive from English law.

==Right to bear arms==
[[File:Grant of arms2.jpg|240px|thumb|Illustration from a manuscript [[grant of arms]] by [[Philip II of Spain]] to Alonso de Mesa and Hernando de Mesa, signed 25 November 1566.  Digitally restored.]]
According to the usual description of the law of arms, coats of arms, armorial badges, flags and standards and other similar emblems of honour may only be borne by virtue of ancestral right, or of a [[grant of arms|grant]] made to the user under due authority. ''Ancestral right'' means descent in the male line from an ancestor who lawfully bore arms. ''Due authority'' has, since late medieval times, been the Crown or the State.

In the United Kingdom and Commonwealth, the Crown's prerogative of granting arms is delegated to one of several authorities depending on the country. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the authority to grant arms is delegated to the Kings of Arms of the [[College of Arms]], under the direction of the [[Earl Marshal]]. In Scotland, this authority is delegated to [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] at his or her own discretion. In Canada, it is exercised by [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] under the direction of the [[Governor-General of Canada]].

In Ireland, unlike the position in the United Kingdom, a grant of arms from an official authority is not a legal prerequisite to the use of arms.  For example, heraldic symbols and coats of arms that existed pre-1552 and afterwards belonged to the Gaelic tradition may continue in use, as well as arms without any official basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacLysaght|first=Edward|title=Irish Families|isbn=0716523647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, whilst the power to grant new arms is restricted to the king, the [[Cronista Rey de Armas|Cronistas de Armas]] (Chroniclers of Arms) have the power to certify arms within the province(s) of their appointment. As of 2008, there is currently only one, with authority only in the provinces of [[Castile and León]].

==Law of arms as part of the general law==

While the degree to which the general law recognises arms differs, in both England and Scotland a grant of arms confers certain rights upon the grantee and his (or her) heirs, even if they may not be easily protected. No person may lawfully have the same coat of arms as another person in the same heraldic jurisdiction although in England the bearing of identical arms without differencing marks by descendants from a common armigerous ancestor has been widespread and tolerated by the College of Arms.

Although the common law courts do not regard coats of arms as either property or as being defensible by action, armorial bearings are a form of property nevertheless, generally described as ''tesserae gentilitatis'' or insignia of gentility. Armorial bearings are incorporeal and impartible [[hereditament]]s, inalienable, and descendable according to the law of arms. Generally speaking (there have been very rare examples of patents in which the arms are granted to descend with some different limitation), this means they are inherited by the issue (male and female) in the male line of the grantee, though they can be inherited as quarterings by the sons of an [[heraldic heiress]], where there is no surviving male heir, provided her issue also have a right to bear arms in their own male line.

===Ireland===
In Ireland the granting of arms to Irish citizens or to those who can prove Irish ancestry is considered to be a cultural tradition which is allowed through the Office of the [[Chief Herald of Ireland]]. This Office was established under the English Crown in 1552 as the Ulster King of Arms and was converted to the Chief Herald's Office after the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]].

The Office of Chief Herald was given statutory force in the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0011/sec0013.html#sec13&lt;/ref&gt;  However some doubts remained as to the effectiveness of the 1997 Act and proposals for further legislative amendment have been made by individual public representatives.  For example, on 8 May 2006 Senator Brendan Ryan introduced the Genealogy &amp; Heraldry Bill, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2006/2306/b2306s.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in Seanad Éireann (Irish Senate) to this end.

===England and Wales===
In England and Wales, the law of arms is regarded as a part of the laws of England, and the common law courts will take judicial notice of it as such. These dignities, as they are called, have legal standing. But the law of arms is not part of the common law and the common law Courts have no jurisdiction over matters of dignities and [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours]], such as armorial bearings, or peerages. In this respect the law of arms was most influenced by the civil law and may be regarded as similar to the ecclesiastical law, which is a part of the laws of England influenced by canon law, but not part of the common law.

In England the exclusive jurisdiction of deciding rights to arms, and claims of descent, is vested in the [[Court of Chivalry]]. As the substance of the common law is found in the judgments of the common law Courts, so the substance of the Law of Arms can only be found in the customs and usages of the Court of Chivalry. However, the records of this are sparse, not least because the Court never gave reasoned judgments (the Lord Chief Justice who sat in 1954 offering the sole exception to this, no doubt because of his professional background as a common law Judge).  The procedure was based on that of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], but the substantive law was recognised to be English, and peculiar to the Court of Chivalry.

Until 1945 coats of arms (engravings, public paintings, etc.) were taxed, with no distinction made in the statute between arms granted by the College of Arms or those which were self-assumed.

===Scotland===
The law of arms as understood in Scotland consists of two principal parts, the rules of heraldry (such as blazoning), and the law of heraldry. In contrast to the position in England, the Law of Arms is a branch of the civil law. A coat of arms is [[incorporeal]] heritable property, governed, subject to certain specialities, by the general law applicable to such property. The possession of armorial bearings is therefore unquestionably a question of property. The misappropriation of arms is a real injury, actionable under the common law of Scotland.

===Canada===
The Canadian law of arms is now regulated by the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]].

===Denmark===
In Denmark the unlawful use of coats of arms and other insignia of Danish and foreign authorities is a criminal offence (Danish Criminal Code §§ 132-133). Non-official coats of arms are not protected. A specific rendition of a coat of arms is protected through copyright law and a coat of arms can be used as a trademark and will thus be protected by trademark law. There is no official heraldic authority for private arms in Denmark. Most insignia used by municipalities are regulated by the Heraldic Consultant to the Danish State (an office under the Danish National Archives). Registration by the Heraldic Consultant to the Danish State is a prerequisite for protection of official Danish insignia under the Criminal Code's §§ 132-133. Protection of an insignia in terms of trademark law requires registration by the trademark authorities. If an insignia is registered by the Heraldic Consultant, trademark rights are automatically acquired as well.

During the [[Absolute monarchy|Absolutist]] era, arms of nobility were granted by the King's herald, but this office was dissolved in 1849 when the absolutist era ended. Since then, the only way to acquire coats of arms in Denmark is through assumption.

===Norway===
{{main|Norwegian heraldry}}
The national arms and the royal arms arms sort under the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], and military arms are a matter of the heads of each branch of the Norwegian Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Cappelen:The Heraldry of the Norwegian Armed Forces,''Genealogica &amp; Heraldica Lisboa 1986'', Lisboa 1989, Vol. 2, p. 179-185&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Archives of Norway]] are the heraldic authority for the royal approbation of [[List of coats of arms of Norway|municipal arms]].&lt;ref&gt;Hans Cappelen: Règles pour utilisation des armoiries communales en Norvège", ''Archivum Heraldicum'' (1-2) 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Public arms are protected by the [[Penal Code (Norway)|Norwegian Penal Code]], article 328.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lovdata.no/all/hl-19020522-010.html#328 Straffeloven, § 328] at [[Lovdata]].&lt;/ref&gt; The same article prohibits as well unauthorised use of foreign public arms and some distinctive signs of international organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Cappelen:The Concept of the Coat of Arms in Norwegian Legislation", ''Kongressbericht'', Stuttgart 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

There exists no official authority for private arms and the question of legal protection of private arms has not been asked to a Norwegian legal court.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Cappelen:"On taking the family arms of others", ''Genealogica et Heraldica – Wien 14.19. September 1970'' (Congress Report) Vienna 1972
.&lt;/ref&gt; Personal arms, family arms and other private arms have been self assumed in Norway since the Middle Ages, without any grants, interference or protests from the public authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Cappelen: ''Norske Slektsvåpen'', Oslo 1969 pages 25-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In Germany the arms relate to a family, and so a name, and not to an individual. The right to the arms passes from the original bearer to those of his legitimate direct descendants by a male line. Since 1918 heraldic affairs are handled under the Civil Law.  The right to arms is now considered analogous to the right to names, expressed in the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]] § 12; this interpretation was confirmed in 1992 by the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]]. Thus, if one has the right to certain arms, that right is protected by the courts. Personal arms are protected as a part of the name if the arms are officially recorded and published.

===Italy===
Speaking very generally, Italian coats of arms may be said to be familial rather than personal. A formal system for indicating cadency is unknown outside the [[House of Savoy]]. In Italy there has been no official regulation of familial coats of arms or titles of nobility since abolition of the [[Consulta Araldica]] in 1948, and that body addressed itself primarily to state recognition of titles of nobility rather than the heraldry of untitled armigers such as nobili (untitled nobles) and patrizi (of the patriciates in the former city-states). Until the unification of the country in the decade leading to 1870, the issuance and use of familial coats of arms was exercised rather loosely in the various Italian states, with each region applying its own laws, and the principal focus was titles of nobility or (before circa 1800) feudal rights. Indeed, upon ennoblement, a count or baron not from an armigerous family might actually assume his own, original coat of arms without recourse to any authority.  For this reason, actual grants of arms were very rare. There is no complete armory of Italian coats of arms, though certain authors, most importantly  [[Giambattista Crollalanza]], compiled references which appear to be nearly complete. Until the establishment of the republic (1946) and its constitution two years later, most coats of arms in Italy appertained to noble families, whether titled or not, although a number of blazons were identified with cittadini (burghers) whose families had used these for a century or more.  The ''Blasonario'' contemplated by the Consulta Araldica would have been an official compilation of blazons (i.e. an armory) but, unfortunately, it was still in a very early draft stage when the monarchy fell in 1946. In 1967 the Constitutional Court ruled that nobiliary and heraldic matters were "outside the scope of the law". Italy's concordat with the [[Holy See|Vatican]] in 1984, revising the [[Lateran Treaties]], abrogated the article whereby Italy recognises Papal titles.

===South Africa===
Under South African law, which is Roman–Dutch, all citizens have the right to assume and bear arms as they please, provided they do not infringe the rights of others (e.g. by bearing the same arms). The [[Bureau of Heraldry]] has the power to register coats of arms to protect against misuse, but registration of arms is voluntary.

===United States===
In the United States protection of coats of arms is for the most part limited to specific units of the armed forces, with a few exceptions. [[George Washington]],  in personal correspondence, expressed opposition to establishment of a national heraldic authority, though he made use of his own ancestral arms. Personal coats of arms may be freely assumed but the right to these blazons is not protected in any way. It is possible that a coat of arms could be successfully protected as a [[trademark]] or [[service mark]], but, in general, such protection is reserved for commercial use as a mark connected with a good or service, and not as a heraldic coat of arms. For example, the [[University of Texas at Austin]] has registered&lt;ref&gt;US Trademark Serial No. 73321841&lt;/ref&gt; its emblem and coat of arms for use in its capacity as an institution of higher education. Moreover, such protection presumes a specific graphic design or work of art, while blazon is a description which may be widely interpreted artistically.  A specific coat of arms could be protected by [[copyright]] as a pictorial, graphic or sculptural work.  The usual requirements of originality and artistic creativity would need to be met; neither notice nor registration is required but may be advisable.

==Enforcement of the law of arms==

===England: Court of Chivalry===
{{main|Court of Chivalry}}
In England the officer with power to adjudicate on legal aspects of the law of arms is the Earl Marshal, whose court is known as the Court of Chivalry. The court was established some time prior to the late fourteenth century with jurisdiction over certain military matters, which came to include misuse of arms.

Its jurisdiction and powers were successively reduced by the common law courts to the point where, after 1737, the Court ceased to be convened and was in time regarded as obsolete and no longer in existence.  That understanding was authoritatively overturned, however, by a revival of the Court in 1954, when the [[Earl Marshal]] appointed the then [[Lord Chief Justice]] to sit as his surrogate.  The Lord Chief Justice Lord Goddard confirmed that the Court retained both its existence and its powers, and ruled in favour of the suit before him.

However, in his judgement (''Manchester Corporation v Manchester Palace of Varieties'' [1955] P 133) Lord Goddard suggested that

:if this court is to sit again it should be convened only where there is some really substantial reason for the exercise of its jurisdiction.

In 1970, [[Arundel Herald Extraordinary]] advised [[Wolfson College, Oxford]] (who were considering whether to invoke a controversial University privilege in order to avoid paying for a grant of arms) that the effect of Lord Goddard’s dictum “must make any further sitting of the court unlikely even for a cause of instance; and the revival of causes of office, which were obsolescent even in the seventeenth century, would be more difficult still.” (quoted in “The Coat of Arms of Wolfson College Oxford” by Dr Jeremy Black ''The College Record'' 1989–90).

In 1984, [[Garter King of Arms]] declined to ask the Court to rule against the assumption of unauthorised arms by a local authority, doubting whether the precedents would give jurisdiction (''A New Dictionary of Heraldry'' (1987) Stephen Friar p 63).

Hence, although the Law of Arms undoubtedly remains part of the law of England, and although the Court of Chivalry in theory exists as a forum in which it may be enforced, there is difficulty in enforcing the law in practice (a point made in ''Re Croxon, Croxon v Ferrers'' [1904] Ch 252, [[Arthur Kekewich|Kekewich]] J).  The absence of a practical remedy for the illegal usurpation of arms in the law of England does not mean that there are no rights infringed, merely that it is not within the jurisdiction of the common law courts to act and that the court that is so empowered does not now sit.

===Scotland: Court of the Lord Lyon===
{{main|Court of the Lord Lyon}}
In Scotland, [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] is the judge of the Lyon Court, which has jurisdiction over all heraldic matters. An act of the Scottish parliament in 1592 made the unauthorised use of arms a criminal offence and gave Lyon the responsibility to prosecute such misuse, though in practice this might not be legal today. Unlike the Court of Chivalry, the Court of the Lord Lyon is very much alive, and is fully integrated into the Scottish legal system.

==Arms conferring nobility==
In England a grant of arms does not [[Ennoblement|ennoble]] a grantee in itself, but is a recognition of rank or status and, therefore, an authoritative confirmation of it.  An armiger (one who has the right to bear arms) is deemed to be of the status of a [[gentleman]], and in England, many of the suits in the Court of Chivalry were decided on that basis.  He may of course be of higher rank, as [[esquire]], knight, peer, or prince.

In contrast, a coat of arms in Scotland is often, not without controversy, said to be a [[fief]] annoblissant, similar to a Scottish territorial [[peerage]] or [[Scottish feudal barony|barony]]. Under Sir [[Thomas Innes of Learney]] (Lord Lyon King of Arms 1945–1969), wording was introduced into every Scottish [[patent]] of arms which states that the grantee "and his successors in the same are, amongst all Nobles and in all Places of Honour to be taken, numbered, accounted and received as Nobles in the Noblesse of Scotland".  These claims, strongly championed by Innes of Learney himself and by other writers, have now found broad acceptance amongst legal commentators as correctly representing the Law of Arms in Scotland (for example, ''The Stair Encyclopaedia of Scots Law''  (vol. 11, p.&amp;nbsp;548, para. 1613)), but are challenged by others, some of whom are reluctant to place a grant of arms on the same legal plane as a feudal barony or peerage.

In 2008, the so-called nobility clause seen in Scottish grants of arms since the days of Lord Lyon Innes of Learney was dropped and is no longer included in new grants of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cheshire-heraldry.org.uk/weblog/2008/07/18/as-he-giveth-so-shall-he-take-away/|title=As he giveth, so shall he take away.|publisher=|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the European continent, there is a clear difference between noble arms and [[burgher arms]].

In most countries, scholars agree that a coat of arms is an indication of nobility, but that (in times past) simply assuming a coat of arms did not ennoble the [[armiger]]. In certain countries (viz. the Italian states pre-1860), armorial heraldry was not strictly regulated, while titles of nobility were.

As a generality, most nobles, whether titled or not, have coats of arms, hence the widely held perception of heraldry as an aristocratic trapping.

==Assumption of arms==
While in the continent of Europe assumption of arms has mostly remained free, in some countries arms may not be assumed or changed at will. In particular, there is some basis for the claim that it is unlawful to assume arms in England and Wales without the authority of the Crown. This is the view of the College of Arms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/About/12.htm|title=Registering a Pedigree - College of Arms|publisher=|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is supported by some dicta in court cases, including ''In re Berens'', [1926] Ch. 596, 605–06, and ''Manchester Corporation v Manchester Palace of Varieties Ltd,'' [1955] P. 133 (the only modern decision of the Court of Chivalry). However, there is no holding by a modern court directly on point. For cases considering the question but not deciding it, see ''Austen v. Collins'', 54 L.T.R. 903 (Ch. 1886); ''In re Croxon'', [1904] Ch. 252.

However, the assumption of arms has in every age been common, and became particularly so after the [[College of Arms]] ceased to obtain warrants to search out the illegal use of armory by roving enquiries known as the [[Heraldic visitation|Visitations]], the last of which took place at the end of the seventeenth century.  The interpretation and application of modern legal principles (such as freedom of expression) have also influenced this, and the annual tax on coats of arms was repealed in 1945.

''Burke's General Armory'' (last edition 1884) is said to contain arms attributed to 60,000 families (''The Upper Classes; Property and Privilege in Britain'' J. Scott (1982) p 91).  But it has been calculated that there were only 9,458 armigerous families in 1798 (''The Nobility of the English Gentry'' J. Lawrence (1824)) and a total of 8,320 grants of arms made in the 19th century (''English Nobility:  the Gentry, the Heralds and the Continental Context'' M J Sayer (1979)), which implies, albeit on an extremely rough and ready basis, about 40,000 assumptions of arms.

The '''Lessing Theater''' was a [[theatre]] in the [[Mitte (locality)|Mitte]] district of [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. It opened in 1888 and was destroyed in April 1945 in a [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|bombing raid]]; its ruins were demolished after [[World War II]].

The construction of the theatre, for around 900,000 Mark, was especially notable since it was the first new theatre built in Berlin since the construction of the [[Wallner Theater]] in 1864; in between only renovations of old theatres and existing spaces had taken place. By order of director [[Oscar Blumenthal]], the building, designed in a [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]] style by the architects [[Hermann von der Hude]] and [[Julius Hennicke]], was constructed in less than a year, between October 1887 and September 1888. The theatre opened on 11 September 1888, staging [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s drama ''[[Nathan the Wise]]''.

==Location==
[[File:Berlin Lessingtheater Lage.jpg|thumb|Location of the theatre between Stadtbahn and Spree]]
The oddly angled piece of land, the site of former [[Circus]] Krembser, was located in the historic Friedrich-Wilhelm-Stadt quarter, at the corner of [[Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia (1828–1885)|Friedrich-Karl]]-Ufer 1 (since 1951: [[Heinz Kapelle|Kapelle]]-Ufer) on the [[Spree]] riverside and Unterbaumstraße. Wedged between the [[Berlin Stadtbahn|Stadtbahn]] railway viaduct and the [[Firewall (construction)|firewall]] of the building nextdoor, it made for a difficult design of a prestigious building. The architects designed a cupola above the podium that covered up the firewall, and the front facade with its [[portico]] turned the street corner into a kind of [[Vestibule (architecture)#Ancient usage|vestibule]]. The remaining triangular outside areas were set off from the street with lattice work and gates and functioned as gardens; the remaining area in the back served as delivery courtyard.

The location was commercially viable; the completion of the nearby [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] beyond the Spree River, linked by the ''Kronprinzenbrücke'', promised a future appreciation of land values. The [[horsecar]]s which passed in front of the theatre made the theatre easily accessible from all neighbourhoods.

==The building==
The staircases leading to the spectators' areas were combined with the rest of the [[Parts of a theatre#House|house]]. Its function as a theatre was indicated by the facade's vestibule, the double pillars, and the [[gable]]. The towers with double arcades above the staircases were probably designed with an eye on the building's appearance from afar, but also emphasized the building's character. The middle part was dominated by the stalls, while the appearance from the rear was determined by the roof of the stage.&lt;!--if anyone can translate this I'd be very grateful:  ...hintere Teil war bestimmt durch das kuppelbekrönte Bühnenhaus, das von den um ein Geschoss reduzierten Nebenbauten umgeben war. Diese Anordnung war bewährt, an vielen Theatern dieser Zeit erprobt und entsprach damit einem Standardbautypus.--&gt;
[[File:Berlin Lessingtheater DBZ 1888 Ansicht.jpg|thumb|left|Theatre in its opening year in 1888 with horse trams and Stadtbahn viaduct]]

===Front of house and other areas===
Spectators entered the theatre through one of three doors in the vestibule, which was equipped with a roof to protect unloading horse cars. The lobby measured 15.40 by 9.00 metres. Ticket counters were placed on either side of the lobby, with doors beside them that gave access to the second storey balconies. Doors directly across from the entrance led to the stalls and the first level of balconies.

After the show, spectators from the stalls left the theatre through two separate doors on the side of the theatre or through the main lobby. Spectators from the first and second rows of balconies had special exits through the staircases, so they would not have to cross the lobby again. This allowed the theatre to empty quickly and permitted shorter time periods between two shows.

Wardrobes were available outside the various spectator areas. The hallways also functioned as spectator space during intermissions. For the more prominent visitors, in the stalls and the first gallery, a separate [[foyer]] above the main lobby was allocated, a grand room, measuring 9.45 by 15.60 metres, and 6.80 metres high. During warmer seasons, doors opened up to a balcony above the vestibule and to balconies on either side of the corridors for the first gallery. Spectators in the second gallery had two bars available for beer, which also allowed access to an outside area.

===House: spectator areas===
[[File:Lessingtheater Innenansicht.jpg|thumb|House]]
[[File:Berlin Lessingtheater DBZ 1888 Grundrisse.jpg|thumb|Floorplans for stalls and second gallery]]
The theater's first [[artistic director]], [[Ernst von Possart]], desired the basic dimensions of the spectator area be copied from [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]'s [[Konzerthaus Berlin|Schauspielhaus]] because of its good acoustics. The hall had the shape of a lengthened semi circle with a radius of 18.46 metres, with a 5-metre deep [[proscenium]], tapered from 13.90 to 11.50 metres. The hallways of the stalls were 1,00 metres above street level, those of the first gallery 4.70 metres, and those of the second gallery 8.40 metres. There were 1170 seats. With the exception of the left side of the first gallery, which contained the royal [[Box (theatre)|box]], each gallery on both sides of the proscenium had two closed boxes each.

In the stalls, there were 18 boxes with 116 seats along the outer wall. 17 rows provided seating for 350 spectators; four rows with 58 second-class seats, below the first gallery balcony, were accessible via a central corridor. The seats measured 0.80 by 0.54 metres, at the time of the opening larger even than that of the  [[Berlin State Opera|Staatsoper Unter den Linden]].

The first gallery largely consisted of boxes with a total of 140 seats. The five outside boxes on either side reached to the parapet; the ten boxes on the inside had three rows of seats in front of them ("balcony seats"), offering room for 72 spectators. The second gallery, besides the 28 seats in the proscenium boxes, offered seating in rows for 316 spectators and standing-room for 70 more.

The [[rococo]]-style auditorium was mainly white and gold. Rear walls were coloured bronze. All curtains and upholstery were blue silk.

===Stage house and adjacent areas===
The stage and adjacent areas were accessible via a ramp in the back, and through doors in the two staircases in the additions on either side. These side additions also had dressing rooms, on the ground floor. Dressing rooms for the choir and the extras were in the basement. Management was on the third floor, and costumes and props were stored on the floor above. The space behind the stage, two storeys high, served as storage for the [[Scenic design|sets]]; the third-story level housed furniture, and the fourth-storey level was the [[scene shop]].

The stage measured {{convert|20|by|18.33|m|ft}}, enough for six set changes.  Tiefe ausreichend for six Kulissen. The [[Fly system]] was 18.00 meters above the stage. A two-part iron [[fire door]] closed the stage from the sides.

===Construction and facade===
The building was constructed mainly from [[brick]] and [[iron]], in hopes of minimising the risk of fire; only the stage was made of [[wood]]. The construction of a number of stairs in stone and the covering of the roofs and the cupola of the stage with sheet iron completed the precautions against fire. The flat roof over the rooms next to the stalls was done in cement. Lighting was electric.

The theatre was covered in [[plaster]]; only the ornaments of the outer facade were [[sandstone]]. For the facade, architects von der Hude and Hennick were inspired by [[Renaissance Revival architecture]]. For the inside, they opted for [[Mannerism]], and the arena was inspired by Neorococo; in all, the plurality of styles made the theatre a typical representative of [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]].

==Post–war==
[[File:Calatrava-puente-berlin.jpg|thumb|Riverside with ''Kronprinzenbrücke'', 1995]]
Upon the [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied occupation]] of Berlin in 1945, the site in Mitte was located directly at the border of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] sector with the [[United Kingdom|British]] occupied borough of [[Tiergarten, Berlin|Tiergarten]], from 1949 the demarcation line between [[East Berlin|East]] and [[West Berlin]]. In 1961 the premises between the Spree River and the Stadtbahn became part of the "death strip" on the [[Berlin Wall]], with no obstacles remaining that would inhibit a sure shot on fugitives. On 18 February 1968 a couple trying to overcome the barriers nearby was killed by members of the East German [[Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic|Border Troops]].

After the Wall came down in the course of the 1989 [[Peaceful Revolution]], the riverside was rebuilt as part of the new governmental district around the Reichstag parliament building, including the rebuilt ''Kronprinzenbrücke'' designed by [[Santiago Calatrava]]. From 2005 onwards, the cleared premises of the former theatre were used as ''Bundespressestrand'' restaurant, named after a neighbouring [[news conference]] building. After a temporarily appearance of the [[Occupy Berlin]] movement, the area since 2011 is the construction site of the new Berlin headquarters of the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Education and Research]].

The conference was formed in 2001.  Band class is arranged by the total number of instrumentalists (band proper, pit and percussion) and drum majors.  The color guard is not included in the total number of performers (only for classification purposes). The smallest bands are assigned to Class 1 and the largest bands are assigned to Class 5, with a rubric to determine each class size.

In addition to marching band, MAC also hosts winter guard and winter percussion competitions.  There are several classifications in both guard and percussion, which is broken up by the ability and talent of the units, and not by size.

The steam locomotive '''Onward''' had polygonal driving wheels. This rather ineffective locomotive with only one driving axle was built in 1887 by the [[Hinkley Locomotive Works]] in [[Boston]] for the [[Swinerton Locomotive Driving Wheel Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tracks.lionel.com/thinking-outside-the-circle-a-locomotive-with-non-circular-wheels/ Thinking Outside the Circle: A Locomotive with Non-Circular Wheels.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630164505/http://tracks.lionel.com/thinking-outside-the-circle-a-locomotive-with-non-circular-wheels/ |date=2015-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Scientific American|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ChQ4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=swinerton+locomotive+driving+wheel+company&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2K2EmRx74D&amp;sig=HfcBn_eFV9OH_OMSgogDKuwpOMc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jvlhUrSFNomuyQH0nIG4CQ#v=onepage&amp;q=swinerton%20locomotive%20driving%20wheel%20company&amp;f=false|year=1890|publisher=Munn &amp; Company|pages=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1887 the Swinerton Locomotive Driving Wheel Company in the U.S.A. received a unique locomotive boldly called ''Onward'', which had been built by the Hinkley Locomotive Works of Boston. Its unique feature was that its wheels were not round. The company's founder, [[C. E. Swinerton]], had specified that both driving wheels should actually polygons with 118 sides, each flat segment being about 2 inches (50mm) long. He wanted to prove that the line contact at the intersection of each segment would have better rail adhesion than a circular wheel, which was supposed to have only a point contact. However this was actually not the case as even steel deforms under enough pressure, so there is on fact a contact area even with a circular wheel.&lt;ref name="Onward"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/polygon/polygon.htm |title=Locomotives with Non-Circular Wheels |website=The Museum of Retro Technology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722215705/http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/polygon/polygon.htm |archive-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[4-2-2]] locomotive had one single driving axle. This wheel arrangement had been abandoned elsewhere because of its poor adhesion. Probably it was chosen to emphasise the effectiveness of the invention. The ''Onward'' was tried on several north-eastern lines, but did not prove to be beneficial, and thus failed to convince practical railway men. It is likely that the non-constant radius would have caused tremendous amount of vibration.&lt;ref name="Onward"/&gt;

It was sold to the [[Portland and Rochester Railroad]], after the polygonal driving wheels had been replaced with conventional round ones. After a few years the P &amp; R sent it to the Manchester Locomotive Works for reconstruction as an ordinary eight-wheeler. "Onward" was cut up for scrap in 1905.&lt;ref name="Onward"/&gt;

[[File:Caldarium.JPG|Pilae stacks in the [[Roman Baths (Bath)|Roman Baths]] at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England.|thumb|right]]
'''Pilae stacks''' are stacks of pilae tiles, square or round tiles, that were used in Roman times as an element of the [[underfloor heating]] system,&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Middleton. 1892&lt;/ref&gt; common in [[Thermae|Roman bathhouses]], called the [[hypocaust]]. The concept of the Pilae stacks is that the floor is constructed at an elevated position, allowing air to freely circulate underneath and up, through the hollow bricks, into the structure walls. Examples of such baths are found not only in [[Rome]], but also in [[Roman Britain]] and distant parts of the Roman Empire such as the baths at [[Chellah]], in modern-day [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

This architectural technique was the first form of underfloor heating and the same principle is still used today.

The group defined in this paper would now be described as the homogeneous Lorentz group with scalar multipliers. &lt;/ref&gt; was first defined by Minkowski (1908) as the [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of [[Minkowski_space#Lorentz transformations and symmetry|Minkowski spacetime isometries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Minkowski, Hermann |date=&lt;!--1907–8--&gt; |title=[[s:de:Die Grundgleichungen für die elektromagnetischen Vorgänge in bewegten Körpern|Die Grundgleichungen für die elektromagnetischen Vorgänge in bewegten Körpern]] |journal=Nachrichten von der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, Mathematisch-Physikalische Klasse |pages=53–111}} (Wikisource translation: [[s:The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic Processes in Moving Bodies|The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic Processes in Moving Bodies]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Minkowski, Hermann |date=&lt;!--1908–9--&gt; |title=[[s:de:Raum und Zeit (Minkowski)|Raum und Zeit]] |journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |volume=10 |pages=75–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a ten-dimensional [[Non-abelian group|non-abelian]] [[Lie group]] of fundamental importance in [[physics]].

== Overview ==
A [[Minkowski_space#Lorentz transformations and symmetry|Minkowski spacetime isometry]] has the property that the interval between [[event (relativity)|event]]s is left invariant. For example, if everything was postponed by two hours, including the two events and the path you took to go from one to the other, then the time interval between the events recorded by a stop-watch you carried with you would be the same. Or if everything was shifted five kilometres to the west, or turned 60 degrees to the right, you would also see no change in the interval. It turns out that the [[proper length]] of an object is also unaffected by such a shift. A time or space reversal (a reflection) is also an isometry of this group.

In Minkowski space (i.e. ignoring the effects of [[gravity]]), there are ten degrees of freedom of the [[Minkowski_space#Lorentz transformations and symmetry|isometries]], which may be thought of as translation through time or space (four degrees, one per dimension); reflection through a plane (three degrees, the freedom in orientation of this plane); or a "[[Lorentz transformation|boost]]" in any of the three spatial directions (three degrees). Composition of transformations is the operator of the Poincaré group, with proper rotations being produced as the composition of an even number of reflections.

In [[classical physics]], the [[Galilean group]] is a comparable ten-parameter group that acts on [[absolute time and space]]. Instead of boosts, it features [[shear mapping]]s to relate co-moving frames of reference.

== Poincaré symmetry ==
'''Poincaré symmetry''' is the full symmetry of [[special relativity]]. It includes:
* ''[[Translation (physics)|translation]]s'' (displacements) in time and space ('''''P'''''), forming the [[Abelian group|abelian]] [[Lie group]] of translations on space-time;
* ''[[rotation]]s'' in space, forming the non-Abelian Lie group of [[three-dimensional rotation]]s ('''''J''''');
* ''[[Lorentz transformation|boosts]]'', transformations connecting two uniformly moving bodies ('''''K''''').

The last two symmetries, '''''J''''' and '''''K''''', together make the [[Lorentz group]] (see also [[Lorentz invariance]]); the [[semi-direct product]] of the translations group and the Lorentz group then produce the Poincaré group. Objects which are invariant under this group are then said to possess '''Poincaré invariance''' or '''relativistic invariance'''.

== Poincaré group ==
The Poincaré group is the group of Minkowski spacetime [[Minkowski_space#Lorentz transformations and symmetry|isometries]]. It is a ten-dimensional [[Compact space|noncompact]] [[Lie group]]. The [[abelian group]] of [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s is a [[normal subgroup]], while the [[Lorentz group]] is also a subgroup, the [[Group action#Orbits and stabilizers|stabilizer]] of the origin. The Poincaré group itself is the minimal subgroup of the [[affine group]] which includes all translations and [[Lorentz transformation]]s. More precisely, it is a [[semidirect product]] of the translations and the Lorentz group, 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^{1,3} \rtimes \mathrm{O}(1,3) \,,&lt;/math&gt;
with group multiplication
:&lt;math&gt;(\alpha, f) \cdot (\beta, g) = (\alpha + f \cdot \beta, \; f \cdot g)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=mVovDwAAQBAJ|title=BMS Particles in Three Dimensions|last=Oblak|first=Blagoje|date=2017-08-01|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9783319618784|location=|pages=80|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of putting this is that the Poincaré group is a [[group extension]] of the [[Lorentz group]] by a vector [[Group representation|representation]] of it; it is sometimes dubbed, informally, as the '''inhomogeneous Lorentz group'''. In turn, it can also be obtained as a [[group contraction]] of the de Sitter group SO(4,1) ~ Sp(2,2), as the [[de Sitter space|de Sitter radius]] goes to infinity.

Its positive energy unitary irreducible [[Representation of a Lie group|representations]] are indexed by [[mass]] (nonnegative number) and [[Spin (physics)|spin]] ([[integer]] or half integer) and are associated with particles in [[quantum mechanics]] (see [[Wigner's classification]]).

In accordance with the [[Erlangen program]], the geometry of Minkowski space is defined by the Poincaré group: Minkowski space is considered as a [[homogeneous space]] for the group.

In [[quantum field theory]], the universal cover of the Poincaré group
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^{1,3} \rtimes \mathrm{SL}(2,C) &lt;/math&gt;
and the double cover
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^{1,3} \rtimes \mathrm{Spin}(1,3) &lt;/math&gt;
are more important, because representations of &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{SO}(1,3)&lt;/math&gt; are not able to describe fields with spin 1/2, i.e. [[fermions]].  Here &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{SL}(2,C)&lt;/math&gt; is the group of complex  &lt;math&gt;(2 \times 2) &lt;/math&gt; matrices with unit determinant.

==Poincaré algebra==
{{Lie groups |Other}}
The '''Poincaré algebra''' is the [[Lie algebra]] of the Poincaré group. It is a [[Lie algebra extension#By semidirect sum|Lie algebra extension]] of the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group. More specifically, the proper (det''Λ''=1), [[Lorentz group#Connected components|orthochronous]] ({{math|''Λ''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;≥1}}) part of the Lorentz subgroup (its [[identity component]]), SO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(1, 3),  is connected to the identity and is thus provided by the [[Exponential_map_(Lie_theory)|exponentiation]]  {{math|exp(''ia&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;'') exp(''iω&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;μν&lt;/sup&gt;''/2)}} of this [[Lie algebra]].  In component form, the Poincaré algebra is given by the commutation relations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=General Principles of Quantum Field Theory |author=N.N. Bogolubov| publisher=Springer |edition=2nd |isbn=0-7923-0540-X |year=1989 |page=272 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VLMj4AvvicC&amp;pg=PA273&amp;dq=pauli-lubanski+pseudovector#v=onepage&amp;q=pauli-lubanski%20pseudovector&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=1-13950-4320 |author=T.

{{Equation box 1

}}
where {{mvar|P}} is the [[Lie group#The Lie algebra associated with a Lie group|generator]] of translations, {{mvar|M}} is the generator of Lorentz transformations, and {{mvar|η }} is the (+,−,−,−) Minkowski metric (see [[Sign convention]]).

The bottom commutation relation is the ("homogeneous") Lorentz group, consisting of rotations, {{math|''J&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''ϵ&lt;sub&gt;imn&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;mn&lt;/sup&gt;''/2}}, and boosts, {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''M&lt;sub&gt;i0&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.  In this notation, the entire Poincaré algebra is expressible in noncovariant (but more practical) language as
: &lt;math&gt;[J_m,P_n] = i \epsilon_{mnk} P_k ~,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[J_i,P_0] =  0 ~,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[K_i,P_k] = i \eta_{ik} P_0 ~,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[K_i,P_0] = -i P_i ~,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[J_m,J_n] = i \epsilon_{mnk} J_k ~,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[J_m,K_n] = i \epsilon_{mnk} K_k ~,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[K_m,K_n] = -i \epsilon_{mnk} J_k  ~,&lt;/math&gt;
where the bottom line commutator of two boosts is often referred to as a "Wigner rotation".  Note the important simplification {{math|[''J&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;+i K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; ,  J&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;−i K&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''] {{=}} 0}},  which permits reduction of the Lorentz subalgebra to '''su(2)'''⊕'''su(2)''' and efficient treatment of its associated [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group|representations]].

The [[Casimir invariant]]s of this algebra are {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;''P''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''W''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''W''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} where {{math|''W''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Pauli–Lubanski pseudovector]]; they serve as labels for the representations of the group.
 
The Poincaré group is the full symmetry group of any [[relativistic field theory]]. As a result, all [[elementary particle]]s fall in [[Wigner's classification|representations of this group]]. These are usually specified by the ''four-momentum'' squared of each particle (i.e. its mass squared) and the intrinsic [[quantum number]]s {{math|''J&lt;sup&gt;PC&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, where {{mvar|J}} is the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] quantum number, {{mvar|P}} is the [[Parity (physics)|parity]] and {{mvar|C}} is the [[Charge conjugation|charge-conjugation]] quantum number. In practice, charge conjugation and parity are violated by many [[Quantum field theory|quantum field theories]]; where this occurs, {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|C}} are forfeited. Since [[CPT symmetry]] is [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] in quantum field theory, a [[T-parity|time-reversal quantum number]] may be constructed from those given.

As a [[topological space]], the group has four connected components: the component of the identity; the time reversed component; the spatial inversion component; and the component which is both time-reversed and spatially inverted.

== Other dimensions ==
The definitions above can be generalized to arbitrary dimensions in a straightforward manner. The d-dimensional Poincaré group is analogously defined by the semi-direct product

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{IO}(1,d-1) := \mathbf{R}^{1,d-1} \rtimes \mathrm{O}(1,d-1) &lt;/math&gt;

with the analogous multiplication

:&lt;math&gt;(\alpha, f) \cdot (\beta, g) = (\alpha + f \cdot \beta, \; f \cdot g)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Lie algebra retains its form, with indices {{mvar|µ}} and {{mvar|ν}} now taking values between {{math|0}} and {{math|d-1}}. The alternative representation in terms of {{math|''J&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} has no analogue in higher dimensions.

==Super-Poincaré algebra==
A related observation is that the [[representations of the Lorentz group]] include a pair of inequivalent two-dimensional complex spinor representations &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{2}&lt;/math&gt; whose [[tensor product]] &lt;math&gt;2\otimes\overline{2}=3\oplus1&lt;/math&gt; is the [[adjoint representation]]. One may identify this last bit with four-dimensional Minkowski space itself (as opposed to identifying it with a spin-1 particle, as would normally be done for a pair of [[fermion]]s, e.g. a [[pion]] being composed of a [[quark]]-anti-quark pair). This strongly suggests that it might be possible to extend the Poincaré algebra to also include spinors. This leads directly to the notion of the [[super-Poincaré algebra]]. The mathematical appeal of this idea is that one is working with the [[fundamental representation]]s, instead of the adjoint representations.  The physical appeal of this idea is that the fundamental representations correspond to [[fermion]]s, which are seen in nature. So far, however, the implied [[supersymmetry]] here, of a symmetry between spatial and fermionic directions, cannot be seen experimentally in nature.  The experimental issue can roughly be stated as the question: if we live in the adjoint representation (Minkowski spacetime), then where is the fundamental representation hiding?

{{Refimprove|lead|date=December 2011}}
A '''prologue''' or '''prolog''' from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πρόλογος ''prologos'', from πρό ''pro'', "before" and λόγος ''logos'', "word" is an opening to a story that establishes the context and gives background details, often some earlier story that ties into the main one, and other miscellaneous information. The Ancient Greek ''prólogos'' included the modern meaning of ''prologue'', but was of wider significance, more like the meaning of [[preface]]. The importance, therefore, of the prologue in [[Greek tragedy#Structure|Greek drama]] was very great; it sometimes almost took the place of a romance, to which, or to an episode in which, the play itself succeeded.

It is believed that the prologue in this form was practically the invention of [[Euripides]], and with him, as has been said, it takes the place of an explanatory first act. This may help to modify the objection which criticism has often brought against the Greek prologue, as an impertinence, a useless growth prefixed to the play, and standing as a barrier between us and our enjoyment of it. The point precisely is that, to an Athenian audience, it was useful and pertinent, as supplying just what they needed to make the succeeding scenes intelligible. But it is difficult to accept the view that Euripides invented the plan of [[Deus ex machina|producing a god out of a machine]] to justify the action of deity upon man, because it is plain that he himself disliked this interference of the supernatural and did not believe in it. He seems, in such a typical prologue as that to the ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', to be accepting a conventional formula, and employing it, almost perversely, as a medium for his ironic rationalism.

==Latin==
[[File:Prologue I.jpg|thumb|Artwork by Gustave Doré.]]
[[Image:Every Man in his Humour title page 1616.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Title page of 1616 printing of ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'', a 1598 play by the English playwright [[Ben Jonson]]. The play belongs to the subgenre of the "[[humours comedy]]"]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}
Many of the existing Greek prologues may be later in date than the plays they illustrate, or may contain large interpolations. On the Latin stage the prologue was often more elaborate than it was in Athens, and in the careful composition of the poems which [[Plautus]] prefixes to his plays we see what importance he gave to this portion of the entertainment; sometimes, as in the preface to the ''[[Rudens]]'', Plautus rises to the height of his genius in his adroit and romantic prologues, usually placed in the mouths of persons who make no appearance in the play itself.

[[Molière]] revived the Plautian prologue in the introduction to his ''[[Amphitryon (Molière)|Amphitryon]]''. [[Jean Racine|Racine]] introduced Piety as the speaker of a prologue which opened his choral tragedy of [[Esther]].

The tradition of the ancients vividly affected our own early dramatists. Not only were the [[mystery play]]s and miracles of the [[Middle Ages]] begun by a [[homily]], but when the drama in its modern sense was inaugurated in the reign of Elizabeth, the prologue came with it, directly adapted from the practice of Euripides and [[Terence]]. [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Sackville, Lord Buckhurst]], prepared a sort of prologue in dumb show for his ''[[Gorboduc (play)|Gorboduc]]'' of 1562; and he also wrote a famous [[Induction (play)|Induction]], which is, practically, a prologue, to a [[miscellany]] of short romantic epics by diverse hands.

==Elizabethan==

Prologues of Renaissance drama often served a specific function of transition and clarification for the audience. A direct address made by one actor, the prologue acted as an appeal to the audience's attention and sympathy, providing historical context, a guide to themes of the play, and occasionally, a disclaimer &lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 17&lt;/ref&gt;.  In this mode, a prologue, like any scripted performance, would exist as the text, the actor who speaks that text, and the presentation of the language as it is spoken.&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  In ushering the audience from the reality into the world of the play, the prologue straddles boundaries between audience, actors, characters, playwrights--basically, it creates a distinction between the imaginary space within the play and the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Jonson]] has often been noted as using the prologue to remind the audience of the complexities between themselves and all aspects of the performance.&lt;ref&gt;Cave, Richard, Elizabeth Schafer and Brian Wooland, Ben Jonson and Theatre, 1999. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The actor reciting the prologue would appear dressed in black, a stark contrast to the elaborate costumes used during the play.&lt;ref&gt;White, Martin, Renaissance Drama in Action, 1998. 125&lt;/ref&gt;  The prologue removed his hat and wore no makeup.  He may have carried a book, scroll, or a placard displaying the title of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  He was introduced by three short trumpet calls, on the third of which he entered and took a position downstage.  He made three bows in the current fashion of the court, and then addressed the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;
The Elizabethan prologue was unique in incorporating aspects of both classical and medieval traditions.&lt;ref name="BrusterDouglas"&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  In the classical tradition, the prologue conformed to one of four subgenres: the ''sustatikos'', which recommends either the play or the poet; the ''epitimetikos'', in which a curse is given against a rival, or thanks given to the audience; ''dramatikos'', in which the plot of the play is explained; and mixtos, which contains all of these things.&lt;ref name="BrusterDouglas" /&gt;  In the medieval tradition, expressions of morality and modesty are seen,&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 14&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a meta-theatrical self-consciousness, and an unabashed awareness of the financial contract engaged upon by paid actors and playwrights, and a paying audience.&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2009. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in fiction==
Prologues have long been used in non-dramatic fiction, since at least the time of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hXCi_DViuqwC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=prologue&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_1 Books.Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; although Chaucer had prologues to many of the tales, rather than one at the front of the book.

'''''Queen of the Mountain''''' is a 2005 [[documentary film]] about [[Theresa Goell]], a middle-aged woman who, in 1947, left her husband and son to dig beneath the Sanctuary of [[Nemrud Dagh]]. Theresa was fascinated by this shrine to King [[Antiochus I Theos of Commagene]], which had been neglected by previous archaeologists.

''Queen of the Mountain'' tells her story through archival footage, family photographs, oral histories, commentary from Theresa's friends and her own letters. ''[[The New York Times]]'' said it offered a "strong, rich narrative with visuals to match."

==Reception==
''The New York Times'' wrote, 
{{quote|Tess Goell was the kind of American [[heroine]] that seemed to exist only in 1930s movies, played by [[Katharine Hepburn]] or [[Rosalind Russell]]. They were women bravely striding into what was largely believed to be a man's world — flying planes, battling city hall, working in formerly all-male offices or newsrooms. Goell strode into archaeology, a divorced, hearing-impaired Jewish woman amid Muslims in southern Turkey.&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes"&gt;{{Citation

'''''Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks to Sultan Mehmed IV of the Ottoman Empire''''', also known as '''''Cossacks of Saporog Are Drafting a Manifesto''''' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: Запорожці пишуть листа турецькому султану), is a painting by Russian&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Ilya Yefimovich Repin {{!}} Russian painter|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ilya-Yefimovich-Repin|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; artist [[Ilya Repin]]. The 2.03&amp;nbsp;m (6&amp;nbsp;foot&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;inch) by 3.58&amp;nbsp;m (11&amp;nbsp;foot&amp;nbsp;9&amp;nbsp;inch) canvas was started in 1880 and finished in 1891.  Repin recorded the years of work along the lower edge of the canvas. [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] bought the painting for 35,000 [[Russian ruble|rubles]], at the time the greatest sum ever paid for a Russian painting.  Since then, the canvas has been exhibited in the [[State Russian Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. 

==Context==
[[File:Sultan_Mehmed_IV_(2).jpg|thumb|[[Mehmed IV]], [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Sultan]] 1648–87]]
''Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks'' depicts a supposedly historical tableau, set in 1676, and based on the legend of [[Cossack]]s sending a reply to an ultimatum of the [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Mehmed IV]]. The original reply, if it ever existed, has not survived; however, in the 1870s an amateur ethnographer from Yekaterinoslav (today [[Dnipro]]), Ya. Novitsky, found a copy made in the 18th century. He gave it to historian [[Dmytro Yavornytsky]] (1855-1940), who by chance read it to his guests, among whom was the painter [[Ilya Repin]]. Repin became curious about the story and in 1880 started the first of his studies.{{cn|date = April 2014}}

According to the story, the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] (from 'beyond the rapids', Ukrainian: ''za porohamy''), inhabiting the lands around the lower [[Dnieper River]] in [[Ukraine]], had defeated [[Ottoman Empire]] forces in battle. However, Mehmed demanded that the Cossacks submit to Turkish rule. The Cossacks, led by [[Ivan Sirko]], replied in an uncharacteristic manner: they wrote a letter, replete with insults and profanities. The painting exhibits the Cossacks' pleasure at striving to come up with ever more base vulgarities. During Repin's time, the Cossacks enjoyed great popular sympathy. Repin also admired them: "All that [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]] wrote about them is true! A holy people! No one in the world held so deeply freedom, equality, and fraternity."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infoukes.com/history/cossack_letter/
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sultan Mehmed IV to the Zaporozhian Cossacks:

As the Sultan; son of Muhammad; brother of the sun and moon; grandson and viceroy of God; ruler of the kingdoms of Macedonia, Babylon, Jerusalem, Upper and Lower Egypt; emperor of emperors; sovereign of sovereigns; extraordinary knight, never defeated; steadfast guardian of the tomb of Jesus Christ; trustee chosen by God Himself; the hope and comfort of Muslims; confounder and great defender of Christians - I command you, the Zaporogian Cossacks, to submit to me voluntarily and without any resistance, and to desist from troubling me with your attacks.

--Turkish Sultan Mehmed IV
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Cossacks' reply came as a stream of invective and vulgar rhymes, parodying the Sultan's titles:{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Zaporozhian Cossacks to the Turkish Sultan!

O sultan, Turkish devil and damned devil's kith and kin, secretary to Lucifer himself. What the devil kind of knight are thou, that canst not slay a hedgehog with your naked arse? The devil shits, and your army eats. Thou shalt not, thou son of a whore, make subjects of Christian sons; we have no fear of your army, by land and by sea we will battle with thee, fuck thy mother.

Thou Babylonian scullion, Macedonian wheelwright, brewer of Jerusalem, goat-fucker of Alexandria, swineherd of Greater and Lesser Egypt, pig of Armenia, [[Podolia|Podolian]] thief, [[catamite]] of Tartary, hangman of [[Kamenets-Podolsky|Kamyanets]], and fool of all the world and underworld, an idiot before God, grandson of the Serpent, and the crick in our dick. Pig's snout, mare's arse, slaughterhouse cur, unchristened brow, screw thine own mother!

So the Zaporozhians declare, you lowlife. You won't even be herding pigs for the Christians. Now we'll conclude, for we don't know the date and don't own a calendar; the moon's in the sky, the year with the Lord, the day's the same over here as it is over there; for this kiss our arse!

- [[Kosh otaman|Koshovyi otaman]] [[Ivan Sirko]], with the whole [[Zaporozhian Host]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks (sketch, 1893, Kharkiv).jpg|thumb|250px|The version that is stored at the {{ill|Kharkiv Art Museum|ru|Харьковский художественный музей|fr|Musée d'art de Kharkov|de|Kunstmuseum Charkiw}}]]

While working on the original version, [[Ilya Repin|Repin]] in 1889 began work on a second version. This work he never finished. The second version of "The Cossacks" the artist tried to make more "historically authentic". In 1932 it was presented by the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] to the {{ill|Kharkiv Historical Museum|ru|Харьковский исторический музей}}. In 1935, it was moved to the {{ill|Kharkiv Art Museum|ru|Харьковский художественный музей|fr|Musée d'art de Kharkov|de|Kunstmuseum Charkiw}}, where it is now stored. This canvas is slightly smaller than the original version. [[Vladimir Gilyarovsky]], a popular journalist of partial Cossack descent, was one of the models who posed for Repin.

* The French poet [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] wrote a versified version of the letter ("Réponse des Cosaques Zaporogues au Sultan de Constantinople") as part of his poem "La Chanson du mal-aimé" in his collection of poems ''[[Alcools]]'' (1913).
:* This versified version of the letter has been set to music by the French singer-songwriter [[Léo Ferré]], who composed a whole [[oratorio]] on ''[[La Chanson du mal-aimé]]'' for soloists, choir and orchestra (1953). Verses were also set to music by Dmitri Shostakovich in his "Symphony Number 14", amongst other poets (Lorca, Rilke) writing about death.

==Biography==
Mason was born Sarah Yeiser Mason in [[Pima, Arizona]]. She and her husband [[Victor Heerman]] won the [[Academy Award for best screenplay adaptation]] for their adaptation for the 1933 film ''[[Little Women (1933 film)|Little Women]]'', based on the novel by [[Louisa May Alcott]]. After that success, she and Heerman were the first screenwriters involved in early, never-produced scripts commissioned for what would become MGM's [[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)]].&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite book|last=Looser|first=Devoney|title=The Making of Jane Austen|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2017|page=130||isbn=1421422824}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mason's career is also notable as she was one of the first in Hollywood to specialize in [[script supervision]] and [[film continuity]] when the industry switched from [[silent film]] to [[talkies]].&lt;ref name="schallert"&gt;Schallert, Edwin (February 4, 1929).

'''Software visualization'''&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Bohnet, Jürgen Döllner: ''Analyzing Feature Implementation by Visual Exploration of Architecturally-Embedded Call-Graphs''. 4th International Workshop on Dynamic Analysis, ACM, ACM Press, pp. 41–48, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, 2002; Diehl, 2007; Knight, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; or '''software visualisation''' refers to the visualization of information of and related to software systems—either the [[software architecture|architecture]] of its [[source code]] or metrics of their [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|runtime behavior]]- and their development process by means of static, interactive or animated 2-D or 3-D&lt;ref&gt;(Marcus et al., 2003; Wettel et al., 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; visual representations of their structure,&lt;ref&gt;(Staples &amp; Bieman, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; execution,&lt;ref&gt;J. Trümper et al.: ''Multiscale Visual Comparison of Execution Traces''. Proceedings of the International Conference on Program Comprehension, IEEE Computer Society, pp. 53-62, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; behavior,&lt;ref&gt;(Kuhn et al., 2006, Stasko et al., 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and evolution.

== Software system information ==
Software visualization uses a variety of information available about software systems. Key information categories include: 
* [[implementation]] artifacts such as [[source code]]s, 
* [[software metric]] data from measurements or from [[reverse engineering]], 
* [[tracing (software)|traces]] that record execution behavior, 
* [[software testing]] data (e.g., test coverage)
* [[software repository]] data that tracks changes.

== Objectives ==
The objectives of software visualization are to support the [[program comprehension|understanding of software systems]] (i.e., its structure) and algorithms (e.g., by animating the behavior of sorting algorithms) as well as the analysis and exploration of software systems and their anomalies (e.g., by showing classes with high [[coupling (computer science)|coupling]]) and their development and evolution. One of the strengths of software visualization is to combine and relate information of software systems that are not inherently linked, for example by projecting code changes onto software execution traces.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bohnet et al.: ''Projecting Code Changes onto Execution Traces to Support Localization of Recently Introduced Bugs''. 24th ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, ACM, pp. 438–442, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Software visualization can be used as tool and technique to explore and analyze software system information, e.g., to discover anomalies similar to the process of [[Data mining|visual data mining]].&lt;ref&gt;(Keim, 2002; Soukup, 2002; Burch, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, software visualization is used to monitoring activities such as for code quality or team activity.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bohnet, J. Döllner: ''Monitoring Code Quality and Development Activity by Software Maps''. Proceedings of the IEEE ACM ICSE Workshop on Managing Technical Debt, pp. 9-16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Visualization is inherently not a method for [[software quality assurance]]{{fact|date=September 2017}}. Software visualization participates to [[Software intelligence|Software Intelligence]] in allowing to discover and take advantage of mastering inner components of software systems.

==Types==
Tools for software visualization might be used to visualize source code and [[software bug|quality defect]]s during software development and maintenance activities. There are different approaches to map source code to a visual representation such as by [[software map]]s&lt;ref&gt;D. Limberger et al.: ''Interactive Software Maps for Web-Based Source Code Analysis''. Proceedings of the International Web3D Conference, ACM, pp. 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Their objective includes, for example, the automatic discovery and visualization of quality defects in object-oriented software systems and services. Commonly, they visualize the direct relationship of a class and its methods with other classes in the software system and mark potential quality defects. A further benefit is the support for visual navigation through the software system.

More or less specialized [[graph drawing software]] is used for software visualization. A small-scale 2003 survey of researchers active in the [[reverse engineering]] and [[software maintenance]] fields found that a wide variety of visualization tools were used, including general purpose graph drawing packages like [[GraphViz]] and [[GraphEd]], UML tools like [[Rational Rose]] and [[Borland Together]], and more specialized tools like [[Visualization of Compiler Graphs]] (VCG) and [[Rigi (software)|Rigi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/smr.270 | title=Software visualization in software maintenance, reverse engineering, and re-engineering: a research survey | journal=Journal of Software Maintenance and Evolution: Research and Practice | date=2003 | volume=15 | issue=2 | pages=87–109 | first=Rainer | last=Koschke}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|99–100}} The range of UML tools that can act as a visualizer by reverse engineering source is by no means short; a 2007 book noted that besides the two aforementioned tools, [[ESS-Model]], [[BlueJ]], and [[Fujaba]] also have this capability, and that Fujaba can also identify [[design pattern]]s.&lt;ref name="Diehl2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephan Diehl|title=Software Visualization: Visualizing the Structure, Behaviour, and Evolution of Software|year=May 2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-46505-8|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original stone Romanesque building designed by [[Arthur Bates Jennings]] was constructed in 1891 as the town's first library.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; A municipally-operated [[Summit Public Library]] was established in 1900, and in 1910 the library was moved to another building, leaving the Romanesque building under-utilized but still belonging to the library. In 1918, ''The Playhouse Association'' was founded as a [[World War I]] relief organization, and the theatrical group rented the empty older library from the Summit Library Association for one dollar a year for the next fifty years on condition that the group maintain the facility. In 1960, a 120-seat auditorium was added and the original 1891 structure was converted into a stage. The Summit Library Association officially deeded the building to the theater in 1968.&lt;ref name = playhouse/&gt;

The '''''Haywain Triptych''''' is a [[panel painting]] by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], currently housed in the [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid, Spain. A date of around 1516 has been established by means of [[dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] research. The central panel, signed "Jheronimus Bosch", measures 135 by 200 centimeters and the wings measure 147 × 66&amp;nbsp;cm. The outside shutters feature a version of Bosch's ''[[The Wayfarer]]''.

==History==
The painting was part of a group of six acquired by king [[Philip II of Spain]] in 1570, and shipped to [[El Escorial]] four years later.  It was later sold to the Marquis of Salamanca, and divided into three paintings. In 1848, the central panel was bought by [[Isabella II of Spain]] and brought to [[Aranjuez]], the right one was returned to Escorial and the left went to the Prado. The triptych was finally recomposed in 1914 in the latter museum.&lt;ref name="Var160"&gt;{{cite book|first=Franca |last=Varallo|title=Bosch |publisher=Skira|location=Milan|year=2004|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy exists at the Escorial.

[[file:The Pedlar, closed state of The Hay Wain by Hieronymus Bosch.jpg|240px|thumb|The closed triptych]]

==Description==

===Shutters===
The exterior of the shutters, like most contemporary Netherlandish triptychs, were also painted, although in this case Bosch used full colors instead of the usual [[grisaille]]. When closed, they form a single scene depicting a wayfarer. Around him is a series of miniatures including the robbery of another wayfarer and a hanged man. The man uses a stick to repel a dog.

According to the most recent interpretations, this figure may represent the man who follows his road in spite of the temptation of sins (such as lust, perhaps symbolized by the two dancing shepherds) and the evil acts occurring around him.&lt;ref name="Var160"/&gt;

===Main panels===
The Haywain triptych follows a similar narrative to ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''.  The left panel shows God giving form to [[Eve]].  Unlike the ''Garden'', though, a narrative sequence flows through the panel in different scenes.  At the top, the rebel angels are cast out of Heaven while God sits enthroned, the angels turning into insects as they break through the clouds. Below this, God creates Eve from the rib of Adam. Next, Adam and Eve find the serpent and the tree; [[Serpent (Bible)|the serpent]] offers them an apple. Finally, at the lowest part of the panel, the angel forces the two out of the [[Garden of Eden]]. Adam speaks with the angel; Eve, in a melancholic pose, looks ahead to the right.

The central panel features a large wagon of hay surrounded by a multitude of fools engaged in a variety of sins, quite apart from the sins of lust which dominates the ''Garden of Earthly Delights''. In the center panel Bosch shows [[Christ]] in the sky, not paralleled in the ''Garden''.  An angel on top of the wagon looks to the sky, praying, but none of the other figures see Christ looking down on the world.  The rightward bow of the figures around the wagon provides the force for the viewer’s eye to move with them on their journey and the cart is drawn by infernal beings which drag everyone to [[Hell]], depicted on the right panel.

The forward kinetic motion of the participants moves the viewer from present-day sin into unadulterated torture in the realms of Hell. The procession on the left side of this panel bends back into the middle ground, but the right side figures continue in a straight line with the wagon, a more evident progress into damnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minnick|first=Nathaniel|title=Hieronymus Bosch’s Triptychs in the Netherlandish Tradition|publisher=University of Michigan|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting materials==
The triptych was thoroughly investigated by the scientists at the Bosch Research and Conservation Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://boschproject.org/ The Bosch Research and Conservation Project]&lt;/ref&gt; with the results published in book form.&lt;ref&gt;Luuk Hoogstede, Ron Spronk, Matthijs Ilsink, Robert G. Erdmann, Jos Koldeweij, Rik Klein Gotink, Hieronymus Bosch, Painter and Draughtsman: Technical Studies, Yale University Press, 2016, pp. 296–313.&lt;/ref&gt; Bosch's palette was rather limited with [[pigments]] including [[azurite]], [[lead-tin-yellow|lead-tin yellow]], [[vermilion]] and [[ochres]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/hieronymus-bosch-haywain-triptych/ Hieronymus Bosch, ''The Haywain Triptych''], ColourLex&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Buddy Bears''''' is the name given to painted, life-size [[fiberglass]] bear sculptures developed by  [[Klaus and Eva Herlitz]], in cooperation with  [[sculptor]] [[Roman Strobl]]. The raised arms of the standing Buddy Bears are aligned on the dissemination of friendliness and optimism, and thus mediate a positive mood.  "The Buddy Bear has become an unofficial ambassador for Germany and is a symbol of Berlin since 2001. The story of the Buddy Bears started with an artistic event in Berlin in 2001. Inspired by the idea of bringing art in the streets of a metropolis like the [[CowParade|cow parade]] in Zurich and New York."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azernews.az/culture/92771.html|title=Kapellhaus hosts "Buddy Bear" award ceremony|date=11 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Classic Buddy Bears presented far beyond Berlin’s city limits, the circle of United Buddy Bears came into being in 2002. The Exhibition travel around the world promoting  "peace, international understanding and tolerance among the nations, cultures and religions of this world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.specsspaces.com/Blogger/KastleWaserman/Article/ArtisticBearHugBerlinsBuddyBears.aspx ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first activities were presented as the ''Buddy Bear Berlin Show''. In 2001, artists painted approximately 350 bears to appear in the public domain, as decorative elements in the streets of Berlin. Four different bear designs (one standing on all four paws, one standing on two legs, one standing on its head and one in a sitting position) took part in this activity in the city centre of Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fruitsq.com/gs/berlin/buddy.html Buddy Bears on the streets of Berlin], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Afterwards, many of the bears were sold at auctions in aid of child relief organisations.  Nowadays, these Berlin Buddy Bears are exclusively presented on private premises, in front of hotels and embassies as well as in the foyers of various office buildings.

There have already been exhibitions of the original ''Buddy Bears''  — designed by local artists — in the cities of [[Shanghai]] (2004), [[Buenos Aires]] (2005) and [[St. Gallen]] / [[Switzerland]] (2006).

''United Buddy Bears'' is an international art exhibition with more than 140 two metre tall fiberglass bears. Under the motto: "We have to get to know each other better, it makes us understand one another better, trust each other more, and live together more peacefully", more than 140 countries acknowledged by the [[United Nations]] are represented, promoting  "tolerance, international understanding and the great concept of different nations and cultures living in peace and harmony". The bears stand "hand in hand" in a "peaceful circle" ('''The Art of Tolerance'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cherryelsewhere.wordpress.com/tag/united-buddy-bears/|title=The Art of Tolerance|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The bears were on display between June and November 2002, in a circle around the [[Brandenburg Gate]]. Around 1.5 million people visited this first exhibition.

On 6 November 2002, the bears were moved to new locations, including their respective countries [[Embassy|embassies]] in Berlin, or back to country that they were based on. Some of the bears were auctioned off to raise money for [[UNICEF]].

After the circle of "United Buddy Bears" had been such an overwhelming success in 2002, a new circle was created in 2003. The idea was to send the circle on a global tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddy-baer.com/en/united-buddy-bears/world-tour/overview.html |title=Global Tour |publisher=Buddy-baer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On their global tour, the "United Buddy Bears" promote peace, love, tolerance and international understanding. The circle changes every time it reaches a new city. This is not only due to the local conditions, but also to their constantly changing order, as the bears are always set up in alphabetic order, following the local language of the host country. This always leads to new and sometimes politically very interesting proximities.

Entry to the exhibitions is always free. This makes it possible for many school classes to visit the exhibitions in the morning — as part of their lessons — to explore and learn a lot about the culture, history, landscape, economy and music of all five continents in a playful manner. During past exhibitions more than 40 million visitors have already admired the colorful United Buddy Bears.

In every metropolis, the United Buddy Bears exhibitions are supported by the government, the foreign ministries, the mayors and the UNICEF organisations. Heads of state – for example the Japanese [[Prime Minister]], [[Junichiro Koizumi]], the German [[President of Germany|Federal President]], [[Horst Köhler]] and First Lady of Egypt, [[Suzanne Mubarak]] as well as UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors such as Sir [[Peter Ustinov]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080816050318/http://www.buddy-baer.com/typo3temp/pics/044b41489f.jpg ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jackie Chan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jackiechankids.com/files/Buddy_Bear_Factory_Visit.htm |title=Jackie Chan and the Buddy Bears |publisher=Jackiechankids.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christiane Hörbiger]], [[Mia Farrow]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6207/1664/1600/mia%20farrow.jpg |title=Mia Farrow and United Buddy Bears |publisher=Photos1.blogger.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iris Berben]] and [[Ken Done]] have opened these exhibitions all over the world. ''United Buddy Bears Special Ambassador'' is the actress [[Dennenesch Zoudé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddy-baer.com/en/united-buddy-bears/world-tour/berlin-20092010/message-of-greetings.html |title=Dennenesch Zoudé and United Buddy Bears |publisher=Buddy-baer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Highlight===
*2003 Berlin: Having visited the exhibition in Berlin in 2002, Sir [[Peter Ustinov]] insisted that [[Iraq]] should be represented in the circle of United Buddy Bears in the future.

==Aid for children in need==
Buddy Bear activities and help for children in need have formed an inseparable unit.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} New ''United Buddy Bears'' are often{{quantify|date=April 2016}} designed to replace the previous unique sculpture of a particular country. Many countries are already represented with the third or fourth bear. The previous bears designed on behalf of the respective countries are generally sold at auctions.

{{As of | 2018 | September}} donations and selling ''Buddy Bears'' at auction had generated a total of [[Euro]] 2,300,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddy-baer.com/en/charity/charity-activities/overview.html|title=Buddy Bears -&amp;nbsp;Charity Activities - Overview|website=www.buddy-baer.com|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in aid of UNICEF and of local organisations helping children in need.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Involved artists==
In the early years, the Bears were designed by regional artists and Berlin celebrities for the exhibition ''Art in the City''.&lt;ref&gt;Eva und Klaus Herlitz: ''Buddy Bär Berlin Show'', page 20, 21 ff, Neptun Verlag AG, CH-8280 Kreuzlingen, {{ISBN|3-85820-152-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From 2002 onwards, thanks to support from [[Lufthansa]], [[Air Berlin]] and the [[:de:Deutscher Hotel- und Gaststättenverband|Berlin Hotel Association]], artists from all five continents took part in the
international project ''United Buddy Bears''. More than 240 artists from over 150 countries have taken part in this project to date,&lt;ref&gt;Eva und Klaus Herlitz: ''United Buddy Bears — The Art of Tolerance'', Page 52 – 357, Berlin, 2009/10, {{ISBN|978-3-00-029417-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; such as, for example [[Arik Brauer]], [[René Cadena Ayala]], [[:de:Hernando León|Hernando León]], [[Ibrahim Hazimeh]], [[Carlos Páez Vilaró]], [[SEO (artist)|Seo Soo-Kyoung]], [[:de:Helge Leiberg|Helge Leiberg]], [[Leda Luss Luyken]], [[Ludmila Seefried-Matějková]] – this is also echoed by the artist and UNICEF Australian National Ambassador, [[Ken Done]].
