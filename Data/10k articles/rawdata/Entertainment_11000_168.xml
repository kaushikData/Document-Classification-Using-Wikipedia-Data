'''''1,227 QI Facts To Blow Your Socks Off''''' is the sixth in a series of books based on the intellectual British [[panel game]] ''[[QI]]'', written by series-creator [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]], director of research [[John Mitchinson (researcher)|John Mitchinson]], and chief researcher James Harkin. Published on 1 November 2012 (9 September 2013 in the US), it is a [[trivia]] book containing 1,227 facts collected during the making of the series, which had been ten years in the making at the time of publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/qi/buy/3062/1227_qi_facts_to_blow_your_socks_off_book/|title=1,227 QI Facts To Blow Your Socks Off (Book)|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
Lloyd said in an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'': "This book is like a set of [[haiku]]. I think it's the best thing we've ever done. It has purity and simplicity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garner|first=Lesley|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/9640410/John-Lloyd-Creating-QI-brought-me-out-of-depression.html|title=John Lloyd: Creating QI brought me out of depression|publisher=''[[Daily Telegraph]]''|date=29 October 2012|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The book contains lists of facts, normally four per page. All the sources for the facts are listed online on the QI website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=John|authorlink=John Lloyd (writer)|author2=[[John Mitchinson (researcher)|Mitchinson, John]] |author3=Harkin, James|title=1,227 QI Facts To Blow Your Socks Off|publisher=[[Faber and Faber]]|date=1 November 2012|pages=310|isbn=978-0-571-29791-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than Lloyd, Mitchinson and Harkin, credit for authorship is also given to ''QI'' researchers (also known as "Elves") Anne Miller, Andy Murray and Alex Bell.

The reason for the number of facts being 1,227, according to Lloyd and Mitchinson, was that they had originally planned to have 1,000 facts and when they wrote down the list containing all the facts that would go in the book, they discovered that they had gone past the number, to 1,227.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = BBC Breakfast, 6 November, 2012 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p010q652 | series = BBC Breakfast | serieslink = BBC Breakfast | credits = [[Charlie Stayt|Stayt, Charlie]]; [[Susanna Reid|Reid, Susanna]]; [[John Lloyd (writer)|Lloyd, John]]; [[John Mitchinson (researcher)|Mitchinson, John]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC Two]] |location= [[Manchester]] | airdate = 6 November 2012 | minutes = 7:45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Marvel's Agent Carter''''', or simply '''''Agent Carter''''', is an American television series created for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] by [[Christopher Markus &amp; Stephen McFeely]], inspired by the 2011 film ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', and the 2013 [[Marvel One-Shots|Marvel One-Shot]] short film of [[Agent Carter (film)|the same name]].&lt;ref name="Synopsis" /&gt; It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|television series of the franchise]]. The series was produced by [[ABC Studios]], [[Marvel Television]], and F&amp;B Fazekas &amp; Butters, with Tara Butters, Michele Fazekas, and Chris Dingess serving as [[showrunners]].

The series features the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Peggy Carter]], with [[Hayley Atwell]] reprising her role from the film series and One-Shot, as she must balance life as a secret agent with that of a single woman in 1940s America. Development on a series inspired by the ''Agent Carter'' short film had begun by September 2013, with Atwell's involvement confirmed in January 2014. That May, ABC bypassed a [[Television pilot|pilot]], ordering the show straight to series, with [[James D'Arcy]], [[Chad Michael Murray]], and [[Enver Gjokaj]] starring alongside Atwell; they are joined by [[Shea Whigham]] for the first season. The series introduces the origins of several characters and storylines from MCU films, while other characters from the films also appear.

The [[Agent Carter (season 1)|first season]], consisting of eight episodes, originally aired from January 6 to February 24, 2015, while the [[Agent Carter (season 2)|second season]], consisting of 10 episodes, originally aired from January 19 to March 1, 2016. Both seasons aired during mid-season breaks of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' Despite a positive critical response, viewership fell steadily, and on May 12, 2016, ABC canceled ''Agent Carter''.&lt;!-- Do not add a reference here per WP:LEADCITE.

== Premise ==
The [[Agent Carter (season 1)|first season]] takes place in 1946, with [[Peggy Carter]] having to balance the routine office work she does for the Strategic Scientific Reserve (SSR) in [[New York City]] with secretly assisting [[Howard Stark]], who finds himself framed for supplying deadly weapons to enemies of the United States. Carter is assisted by Stark's butler, [[Edwin Jarvis]], to find those responsible and dispose of the weapons.&lt;ref name="Synopsis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Synopsis2" /&gt; In the [[Agent Carter (season 2)|second season]], Carter moves from New York City to [[Los Angeles]] to deal with the threats of the new [[Atomic Age]] by the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]] in the aftermath of [[World War II]], gaining new friends, a new home, and a potential new love interest.&lt;ref name="Season2Synopsis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="S2SynopsisLong" /&gt;

* [[Hayley Atwell]] as [[Peggy Carter]]: {{Cast list break|An SSR agent initially stuck doing administrative work.&lt;ref name="Synopsis" /&gt; Butters said Carter's "superpower is the fact that other people underestimate her. And she often uses that to her advantage".&lt;ref name="EWJan2015" /&gt; On the influence that the apparent death of [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] has on Carter, Atwell explained that "he was the greatest person she ever knew—even before he took the serum and became Captain America. She knew his character and she saw a kindred spirit in him. So I think she's grieving the loss of him but she's also determined to make sure that his work wasn't in vain. That gives her a tremendous amount of determination to carry on despite the obstacles that she comes across."&lt;ref name="IGNJan2015" /&gt; Gabriella Graves portrays a young Carter.&lt;ref name="Graves" /&gt;}}
* [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Edwin Jarvis]]: {{Cast list break|Howard Stark's butler and ally to Carter,&lt;ref name="D'Arcy" /&gt; who will eventually be a tutor to [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and inspire his [[Edwin Jarvis#J.A.R.V.I.S.|J.A.R.V.I.S.]] [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref name="Jarvis" /&gt; Atwell referred to Carter's relationship with Jarvis as the series' "comic relief", and said "she needs someone who is in contact with Howard to help kind of run this mission[, and] they have this very witty banter back and forth".&lt;ref name="IGNJan2015" /&gt; Fazekas explained that Some of the character's persona "has come from the comics and some of it we've developed ourselves. Some of it is influenced by James D'Arcy himself and his strengths."&lt;ref name="THRJan2015" /&gt; D'Arcy was initially nervous about portraying Jarvis's comedic side, given his history of "predominantly play[ing] psychopaths".&lt;ref name="ColliderTCAJan2015" /&gt; He did not study [[Paul Bettany]]'s performance as J.A.R.V.I.S. when approaching the character.&lt;ref name="D'ArcyCBRFeb2015" /&gt;}}
* [[Chad Michael Murray]] as Jack Thompson: {{Cast list break|A war veteran and agent with the SSR,&lt;ref name="MurrayIntel" /&gt; described as chauvinistic and "chest-puffing".&lt;ref name="EWJan2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TVLineJan2015" /&gt; Murray compared the character to [[Indiana Jones]], and stated that "he's working his way up to become the head of the SSR. His goal in life is to just be great at his job. So he has a large chip on his shoulder, which gives him an attitude."&lt;ref name="MurrayIntel" /&gt; Murray also noted that, unlike his character on ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', Thompson does not serve as the "moral compass", which meant that he would not be "confined to a box" and would instead be allowed to "really play things up and do what's unexpected".&lt;ref name="MurrayZap2it" /&gt; For the second season, Thompson is made chief of the East Coast SSR office.&lt;ref name="S2SynopsisLong" /&gt;}}
* [[Enver Gjokaj]] as [[Daniel Sousa (character)|Daniel Sousa]]: {{Cast list break|A war veteran who is an agent with the SSR and experiences prejudice due to his crippled leg.&lt;ref name="TVLineJan2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GjokajDeadline" /&gt; "He accepts his injury, he accepts his compromised status in society ... Peggy says, 'Forget this. I'm Peggy Carter. I'm going to do something else.' I think that's the difference between the two of them."&lt;ref name="GjokajReports" /&gt; Considering a potentially romantic relationship between Sousa and Carter, Gjokaj said, "I think there's definitely a situation where...if she hadn't dated Captain America, he might ask her out for a drink. It's like if your new girlfriend dated [[Ryan Gosling]]. It's going to make you sweat a bit."&lt;ref name="LATimesJan2015" /&gt; For the second season, Sousa is made chief of the West Coast SSR office.&lt;ref name="S2SynopsisLong" /&gt;}}
* [[Shea Whigham]] as [[Roger Dooley]]: {{Cast list break|The SSR chief who oversees agents Carter, Thompson, and Sousa,&lt;ref name="Whigham" /&gt; until he dies to save his fellow SSR agents at the end of season one.&lt;ref name="DooleyDies" /&gt; Unlike many of the other agents, Whigham believes that Dooley does respect Carter, saying "I think he likes her. I think he cares deeply. I'm not sure that he can always show that, but I think you'll see that he cares deeply about Carter. And these are things that keep him up at night, as well as the other boys, when I send them out on missions."&lt;ref name="WhighamDetails" /&gt; The character was always intended to die during the first season's penultimate episode, to help build stakes for the series given that "everyone knows Peggy lives", so from the beginning Whigham was only hired for the seven required episodes.&lt;ref name="DooleyDies2" /&gt;}}

=== Development ===
A potential ''Agent Carter'' series was initially brought up in July 2013 by Louis D'Esposito, after a screening of his ''[[Agent Carter (film)|Agent Carter]]'' [[Marvel One Shots|One-Shot]] at [[San Diego Comic-Con]].&lt;ref name="EWJan2015" /&gt; By September, Marvel Television was developing a series inspired by the short film, featuring Peggy Carter, and was in search of a writer for the series.&lt;ref name="AgentCarterTV" /&gt; In January 2014, [[ABC Entertainment]] Group president Paul Lee confirmed that the show was in development, and revealed that Tara Butters and Michele Fazekas would act as the series' showrunners.&lt;ref name="CarterConfirmed" /&gt; Chris Dingess also serves as a showrunner.&lt;ref name="LATimesJan2015" /&gt; In March 2014, [[Christopher Markus &amp; Stephen McFeely]], writers of the ''Captain America'' films, stated that they envisioned the series, which had not yet been greenlit, as a [[miniseries|limited series]] of approximately 13 episodes.&lt;ref name="AgentCarterMar2014" /&gt; By April 2014, there were indications that the series would be ordered straight to series, bypassing a pilot order, and would air between the late 2014 and early 2015 portions of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', if that series got a second season renewal.&lt;ref name="AgentCarterApr2014" /&gt; On May 8, 2014, [[American Broadcast Company|ABC]] officially ordered the series for eight episodes,&lt;ref name="SeriesOrder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="S1EpNumber" /&gt; with executive producers Butters, Fazekas, Markus, McFeely, Dingess, [[Kevin Feige]], Louis D'Esposito, [[Alan Fine (executive)|Alan Fine]], [[Joe Quesada]], [[Stan Lee]], and [[Jeph Loeb]].&lt;ref name="Synopsis2" /&gt; The series was renewed for a second season on May 7, 2015, of 10 episodes.&lt;ref name="S2Renewal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="S2Episodes" /&gt;

=== Writing ===
{{quote box|width=33%|quote=It's a really rich period in history, where this giant opposition we had going for 10 years with the Nazis is gone, and we're not completely positive what the rules are anymore. Who gets the scientists? Who gets the secrets? It's all on the table. Everyone developed these skills in World War II. People became spies, people became murderers. And suddenly the war was over, and they came back, and it's like, 'Wow, I know how to do some shit. Now, what do I do with this?' It's nice to play with that assortment of characters. An office, basically full of people who just came back from the war. There's no telling what any of them experienced last year.|source=—Co-creator Christopher Markus on exploring the dynamic of 1940s characters.&lt;ref name="CBRJuly2014" /&gt;}}

Markus and McFeely stated in March 2014 that the series would be set in 1946 initially, occurring in the middle of the timeline established in the One-Shot, and would focus on one case for Carter. Additional seasons would then advance a year and examine a new case.&lt;ref name="AgentCarterMar2014" /&gt; Despite working on ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' at the same time, Markus and McFeely remained involved with the series after writing the first script.&lt;ref name="CreatorsColliderJan2015" /&gt; When the showrunners joined the series, they went on a "mini-camp" with Markus and McFeely to develop the series from a pilot script written by the pair.&lt;ref name="MiniCamp" /&gt; They looked to several different influences outside of Marvel in developing the series, including ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'', and the works of author [[James Ellroy]].&lt;ref name="LATimesJan2015" /&gt; Elaborating on deviating from the comics, Fazekas said, for example, "if we're using a minor character or a bad guy from an old comic book, we don't have to adhere to what that character was in that comic book from 1945. Because there are so many different iterations of a specific character, you can't be true to every single one."&lt;ref name="THRJan2015Grilled" /&gt; ABC asked the producers to not have the series follow a "Gadget of the Week or Bad Guy of the Week" model, and instead focus on telling the story of Carter balancing her personal and professional lives. Fazekas called this "such a nice change" from previous television experience, with the group feeling free to drop whole story ideas in favor of focusing on the series' central storyline.&lt;ref name="MiniCamp" /&gt;

On the time periods the series could potentially explore following the first season given Carter's role in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', Atwell said, "I think the great thing about the fact that I've already played her at the end of her life means that we know ... [Now] we have an opportunity, if the show does go into second and third and fourth and fifth [seasons], we know that we can explore all of these aspects of her character because we know she lives such a long life and she's had a fulfilled life. I think what's going to start happening in Season 1 is seeds are going to be planted as to what happens in her personal life—and yet it's still open to the possibility of new men coming into her life, deepening relationships with the men that we discover in Season 1. Obviously, the era is 1946 but in the second, third, fourth, fifth season—if it goes onto that—we can explore different time periods. We can explore the late forties, the early fifties, the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, up until present day, so it's very exciting because of that."&lt;ref name="IGNJan2015" /&gt; However, Butters clarified that future seasons would likely stay in the same time period, possibly changing location to a place like Hollywood or Europe, to remain in a pre-S.H.I.E.L.D. setting and avoid competing with ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''&lt;ref name="ButtersCBRMar2015" /&gt; This was the case with the second season, which moved the series to 1947 Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="ComicConIGN" /&gt;

=== Casting ===
Atwell, who portrayed Carter in ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', and the ''Agent Carter'' short film, expressed interest in returning as the character in October 2013,&lt;ref name="CarterAtwell" /&gt; before Lee confirmed her involvement in January 2014.&lt;ref name="CarterConfirmed" /&gt; That August, [[Chad Michael Murray]] and [[Enver Gjokaj]] were cast as SSR agents Jack Thompson and Daniel Sousa, respectively,&lt;ref name="GjokajDeadline" /&gt; while [[James D'Arcy]] was cast the next month as Edwin Jarvis,&lt;ref name="D'Arcy" /&gt; the character who would eventually inspire the [[artificial intelligence]] [[Edwin Jarvis#J.A.R.V.I.S.|J.A.R.V.I.S.]] from the MCU films.&lt;ref name="Jarvis" /&gt; [[Shea Whigham]] was also cast, as SSR chief [[Roger Dooley]].&lt;ref name="Whigham" /&gt; Atwell, D'Arcy, Gjokaj, and Murray returned for the second season.&lt;ref name="S2SynopsisLong" /&gt;

=== Design ===
==== Costumes ====
The costume designer for the series is Giovanna Ottobre-Melton, who felt comfortable with the series' period setting after spending months researching American styles in the 1940s for the 2013 television series ''[[Mob City]]''.&lt;ref name="CostumeMeet" /&gt; She noted that "many comic books were all blended by the color, style, and fabrics" from 1940s New York.&lt;ref name="CostumeSneak" /&gt; Due to the large amount of action in the series, fabrics "with the feel and texture of the 1940s" had to be sourced in large quantities, to allow for the creation of four, five, or more of each costume.&lt;ref name="CostumeMeet" /&gt; Ottobre-Melton's process "for each episode, [is to] read the script first, and then search for historic photos that relate to what the episode is about. Afterwards I chose the fabrics, and then begin to design the outfits."&lt;ref name="CostumeSneak" /&gt;

==== Props ====
When creating the gadgets for the series, the writers noted the need to combine the period setting with the influence of Howard Stark, who opens the door to "things that are fantastic for the time period". They worked closely with the props department to develop technology that appears "both retro and futuristic at the same time", with Fazekas explaining that the goal was to avoid a [[science fiction]] look, so the fantastical aspects were reserved solely for function while the aesthetic was kept within the realms of that time period.&lt;ref name="EPsCBFeb2015" /&gt;

=== Filming ===
Filming for the series took place in Los Angeles, with the story's location shifting from New York City to Los Angeles with the second season to capitalize on this.&lt;ref name="LoebJuly2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MadameMasque" /&gt; [[Gabriel Beristain]], cinematographer for the One-Shot and the first season of the series, used a combination of modern digital technology and traditional analog techniques to replicate the feel of classic films that are set in the 1940s, but to also have the convenience and consistency of modern technology, such as using the [[Arri Alexa]] digital camera, along with Leica Lenses and silk-stocking diffusion nets.&lt;ref name="Beristain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BeristainOS" /&gt; Edward J. Pei took over as cinematographer for the second season.&lt;ref name="PeiDoP" /&gt; Stunt coordinator Casey O'Neill, who also worked on the One-Shot and ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', incorporated the specific fighting styles of the characters, such as the more "CIA-trained" fighting of Carter or the more acrobatic, "[[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]]"-inspired style of antagonist [[List of Agent Carter characters#Dottie Underwood|Dottie Underwood]].&lt;ref name="O'NeillResume" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stunts" /&gt;

=== Visual effects ===
Sheena Duggal serves as visual effect supervisor, returning in the same capacity from the ''Agent Carter'' One-Shot,&lt;ref name="DuggalMOS" /&gt; with the visual effects for the series created by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] (ILM), [[Base FX]],&lt;ref name="ArtVFX" /&gt; and later [[Double Negative (VFX)|DNeg TV]].&lt;ref name="PostVFX" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CrackEffects" /&gt; Duggal worked closest with ILM, who coordinated with Base and DNeg to ensure a "seamless workflow". The majority of the series' visual effects work focuses on set extensions to depict the period setting, as well as the more fantastical aspects such as Howard Stark's inventions,&lt;ref name="PostVFX" /&gt; or [[Darkforce|Zero Matter]] and Jason Wilkes' intangibility in the second season.&lt;ref name="CrackEffects" /&gt;

=== Music ===
In June 2014, [[Christopher Lennertz]], who composed the music for the ''Agent Carter'' One-Shot, talked about potentially working on the series, saying, D'Esposito "told me last summer at Comic-Con that there was a possibility this was going to become a series. And he said that if he was going to be involved, he wanted me to be involved, too."&lt;ref name="LennertzLikely" /&gt; In September 2014, Lennertz officially signed on to compose for the series.&lt;ref name="LennertzConfirmed" /&gt; Lennertz combined all the different style elements of the show in the music, such as mixing jazz and period elements, with orchestra and electronic elements. Lennertz said, the music is "always done from a sense of being sort of in control and savvy and clever, rather than just being strong or just having a superpower or sort of being so much further along than anybody else physically. Part of it was just trying to make it that she's just smarter than everybody else. She's got such command over so many of these situations, and that was the most important thing was to give her that personality."&lt;ref name="LennertzCBR" /&gt; A soundtrack album for the [[Agent Carter (season 1)#Music|first season]] was released on [[iTunes]] on December 11, 2015,&lt;ref name="Soundtrack" /&gt; and the single "Whatcha Gonna Do (It's Up to You)" from the [[Agent Carter (season 2)#Music|second season]] was released on March 18, 2016.&lt;ref name="WatchaGonnaDo" /&gt;

=== Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins ===
{{quote box|width=33%|quote=We work really closely with Eric Carroll in Marvel Studios. He's sort of the guy who tells us, "Well, you can't really do this to that thing, because that's going to step on this project. But what if you do this?" They're really generous with that world.|source=—Fazekas on working in with Marvel Cinematic Universe canon.&lt;ref name="Fazekasio9" /&gt;}}

Because Carter originates from the films, [[Marvel Studios]] co-presidents Feige and D'Esposito "are very invested in this and they've been really collaborative and very generous with their world".&lt;ref name="THRJan2015Grilled" /&gt; Markus, talking about the series' place in the greater architecture of the MCU, later said "you really only need to drop the tiniest bit of hint and its connected. You don't have to go, 'Howard Stark's wearing the same pants that Tony wears!' ... Everything is enhanced just by the knowledge that its all connected."&lt;ref name="CreatorsColliderJan2015" /&gt; Butters said, "We always want to feel like you see us as a piece of [the MCU]. But because of our time period, we kind of are on our own a little bit."&lt;ref name="ButtersIGNJan2016" /&gt;

In July 2014, Fazekas talked about how the series would relate to the One-Shot, saying, "The short really is the basis for the series. [Carter]'s working at SSR, post-war...If you think of the short as sort of the end of the series, the series would be leading up to that moment where she gets assigned to S.H.I.E.L.D."&lt;ref name="IGNJul2014" /&gt; Markus reiterated this in January 2015, but added that "we all agree and understand that [keeping continuity with the short is] going to get tougher if we continue" making the series.&lt;ref name="CreatorsColliderJan2015" /&gt; The first season introduces the origins of the Black Widow and [[Winter Soldier (comics)|Winter Soldier]] programs, which both appear in several MCU films,&lt;ref name="ExploresBW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MarkusMcFeelyFeb2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FazekasButterEWFeb2015" /&gt; while the second season shows the discovery of the [[Darkforce]] (known as Zero Matter in the series), which previously appeared in ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' and has ties to [[Doctor Strange]].&lt;ref name="EPsJan2016CBR" /&gt;

=== Ratings ===
Maureen Ryan of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' blamed both seasons' low viewership on "the questionable scheduling decisions" made by then ABC president [[Paul Lee (television executive)|Paul Lee]], saying that the series "has received lackluster promotion, especially [for its second season]. The botched rollout of season two included a changed premiere date and episodes that were difficult to access in advance on Marvel's dreadful media site. Capping the mishandling is the fact that the full first season was only made available on ABC.com days before season two began, which frustrated viewers who might have wanted to jump on board in advance."&lt;ref name="RyanVarietyMar2016" /&gt;

=== Critical response ===
The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 95% approval rating with an average rating of 7.9/10 based on 34 reviews for the first season. The website's consensus reads, "Focusing on Peggy Carter as a person first and an action hero second makes ''Marvel's Agent Carter'' a winning, stylish drama with bursts of excitement and an undercurrent of cheeky fun".&lt;ref name="ACRT" /&gt; [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 73 out of 100 based on 27 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref name="ACMC" /&gt; The second season scored an 81% approval rating with an average score of 7.9/10 based on 16 reviews. The website's consensus reads, "A move from New York to Hollywood gives Agent Carter new territory to explore, as the series continues to search for a storyline as dynamic as its heroine".&lt;ref name="ACS2RT" /&gt;

=== Analysis ===
Arguing for the renewal of the series for a third season following its low viewership, Ryan said that "letting the show die would be a serious mistake, for the network and for the bigger Disney-ABC conglomerate...These days, entertainment properties have to be viewed not just through the lens of their ratings (admittedly weak for ''Agent Carter''). They have to be evaluated within the context of the overall value they bring to any entertainment colossus, and what ''Agent Carter'' adds to Disney-ABC is simply too valuable to give up ... [bringing] something different to the company's superhero portfolio." She suggested if ABC did not renew the series for broadcast, that it should explore other opportunities, such as debuting on its online Watch ABC app, or being sold to Netflix, where "fans of super-heroic storytelling already flock to" and ''Agent Carter''{{'}}s "status as a period piece—which may have harmed it on broadcast—could be a real draw for Netflix viewers". Ryan also felt Marvel "could copy what [[CBS]] is [[Star Trek: Discovery|doing with ''Star Trek'']]" by creating a subscription service for a monthly fee, where consumers could access Marvel's films and televisions shows "as well as premium exclusives like a third season of ''Agent Carter''". Ryan concluded, "A third ''Agent Carter'' season could help solidify Marvel's standing not just with female fans, but with everyone who appreciates excellent and adventurous storytelling."&lt;ref name="RyanVarietyMar2016" /&gt;

When the series was canceled shortly after the release of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', in which Carter dies, Meagan Damore of [[Comic Book Resources]] felt that "for all intents and purposes" Carter had "effectively been phased out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe", and the universe had subsequently lost "a wonderful role model and...inspiration" to fans of the character and series. Damore lamented the fact that the second season's [[cliffhanger]] ending had been left unresolved, and that viewers would never get the chance to see Carter's "happy ending", despite knowing she gets one, leaving the character's "fate unfulfilled, languishing in the obscurity of 'what could have beens{{'"}}. She also noted that Marvel had now lost "the opportunity to show several prominent MCU events, not the least of which is the founding of S.H.I.E.L.D.", and added that despite making "leaps and bounds for women in the MCU, the same [could not] be said for people of color", wishing the series had addressed Asian American women like [[Hazel Ying Lee]], one of 38 [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]] who died in the line of duty, or Black women like Harriet Ida Pikens and Frances Wills, the first two Black members of the [[United States Naval Reserve]].&lt;ref name="CBRCancellation" /&gt;

==Potential spin-off podcast==
In March 2015, Butters stated that there had been discussions about creating a podcast with ''[[Thrilling Adventure Hour]]'' co-creator and writer Ben Blacker, centered around the fictional ''Captain America Adventure Program'' radio show that is depicted during the series' first season. Butters said that well-received segments had not been part of the original pitch to Marvel, and noted that a second season renewal for the series would help the real world podcast's chances. She stated that the potential episodes would be "little fifteen-minute storylines".&lt;ref name="ButtersCBRMar2015" /&gt;

==Cancellation and future==
In March 2016, Fazekas said the producers felt "bad" about the chances for a third season due to the series' low viewership, adding she "would love to see it live on, even if it's in some other form, digital or whatever. I doubt that there's a [[Netflix]] play for it." She also added that ABC wanted some sort of conclusion to the series, and so the writers and producers would find a way to conclude the lingering plot threads in some form if the series was not renewed.&lt;ref name="EWEPsS2End" /&gt; On May 12, 2016, ABC canceled the series.&lt;ref name="Canceled" /&gt; Loeb said he did not understand the decision, as "there were no conversations" regarding the series, with Marvel only receiving a call from ABC saying ''Agent Carter'' was canceled.&lt;ref name="LoebAug2016" /&gt; He added that since the networks decide what content they would like from Marvel Television, "if someone wants to call and say, 'We want a two-hour ''Agent Carter'' [film special] for May 2017,' {{em|boom}}. We'll put together the greatest ''Agent Carter'' movie we can."&lt;ref name="LoebAug20162" /&gt; Atwell added that she was also not part of the conversation to cancel the series and called it "a network political thing" since ABC wanted Atwell to headline the more "mainstream" drama ''[[Conviction (2016 TV series)|Conviction]]'' "to get their ratings up" instead of staying on ''Agent Carter'', which Atwell felt had gained a "cult following".&lt;ref name="AtwellJuly2017" /&gt; After speculation regarding a revival for the series by Netflix, chief content officer [[Ted Sarandos]] stated the streaming service passed on reviving ''Agent Carter'' because it is "looking for truly original brands to own and in that Marvel space we already have" [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|original Marvel series]]. He also added that due to existing international broadcasting "deal complexities" for the series, Netflix would not have been able to air ''Agent Carter'' globally, as "Some of those output partners still had it on the air, so they would argue its covered by their output [deals]. Unfortunately, it was a business decision more than a creative one."&lt;ref name="NetflixResponse" /&gt;

Atwell had stated on potential further seasons, "We think that there could be more to come....the [second season] finale doesn't suggest that that's it and they live happily ever after; that's the end. We know that's not the case. They've done it in a very clever way which wraps up and that gives the audience a very satisfying conclusion but they're not quite finishing it and leaving it there."&lt;ref name="AtwellS3Potential" /&gt; On the location for a third season, Fazekas stated that moving the series to London had been a possibility, an idea that creators Markus and McFeely had early on. Fazekas added, "you can put the show anywhere, because it's spies. [The location is] all going to be determined by what story we want to tell. I loved [Los Angeles]. I loved how it looked, I loved how it looked on Peggy. We would be very happy to do another L.A. season, but we're not married to it."&lt;ref name="EWEPsS2End" /&gt; Fazekas also said that seeds for a third season had been planted all throughout the second, and that the end of the second season, with someone shooting Thompson and taking the M. Carter file, was "very much tied to a third season arc", with the shooter and their reason for taking the file already determined.&lt;ref name="IGNFazekasS2End" /&gt; Atwell added that the third season would have gone "further back into [Carter's] past" while having "a possible kind of twist... into something to do with [her] family". She also added that more insight would have been provided on Carter's brother, Michael.&lt;ref name="AtwellJun2016" /&gt; Writer [[Jose Molina (writer)|Jose Molina]] expanded on this, stated that the season would have focused on the investigation of the assassination attempt on Thompson's life, along with the revelation that Michael was still alive and involved in some "very nefarious, super-villainous shenanigans".&lt;ref name="MolinaJul2018" /&gt;

{{unreferenced|date=June 2014}}
'''Baithak Gana''' is a form of music originating in [[Suriname]] by the [[Indo-Surinamese|Indian]] community. Baithak is a social gathering. It is a mix of [[Bhojpuri]] folk songs with other [[Caribbean]] influences. It is similar to [[Chutney music]] that originated in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. The most popular exponent in Surinam of the genre were [[Ramdew Chaitoe]] and [[Dropati]].

== Instruments ==

In basic Baithak Gana there are three instruments (though there are other instruments that could be added to the ensemble), [[Pump organ|harmonium]], [[dholak]] and the [[dhantal]]. The [[harmonium]] is a free-standing keyboard instrument similar to a [[reed organ]]. The [[dholak]] is a double headed drum that originated in [[Northern India]], however, it is still used in the folk songs from [[Pakistan]] or [[Nepal]]. The last instrument that is used in this style of music is the [[dhantal]] which serves as the rhythmic piece of the ensemble, it consists of a long steel rod which is then "struck" by a U-formed piece, the origin of this device is unclear, as it may have been brought by the Indian indentured-laborers. The origin of the [[dhantal]] was formed from the use of a long steel rod with an almost-enclosed circle tip at the end used in the yoke of bull-driven carts that were used to transport sugar cane to guide the bulls.  The U-shaped handle piece was derived the use of a horse shoe.

== Places ==

Baithak Gana has its roots from the North Indian styles of music. The contract labours brought this form of style of music from [[India]] to [[South American]], [[Caribbean]], [[Oceanian]], and [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa|African]] countries. In [[South America]], you can think of the countries of [[Suriname]] and [[Guyana]]. In the [[Caribbean]] you can think of the countries of [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Jamaica]]. In [[Oceania]] they mean the country [[Fiji]]. In [[Africa]] they mean the countries of [[Mauritius]] and [[South Africa]]. With the migration of the [[Indo-Surinamese|Indian]] community Baithak Gana has been exported to the Netherlands, the United States and Canada.

== Artists and Musicians ==

Noteworthy artists that had a significant influence on Baithak Gana are [[Ramdew Chaitoe]] and [[Dropati]].

== Baithak Gana in Netherlands ==

After the independence of [[Surinam]] in 1975, many [[Indo-Surinamese]] people migrated to the [[Netherlands]] and took their folk music along. Almost 40 years later the folk music has evolved into a new style. Implementing new music instruments such as a [[synthesizers]] and [[electronic drums]].

[[File:Bal des Quat'Z'Arts 1901.jpg|thumbnail|Bal des Quat'Z'Arts (1901)]]
'''Bal des Quat'z'Arts''' ("Four Arts Ball") was a [[Paris]]ian annual ball, the first held in 1892 and the last in 1966.
The event was organised by Henri Guillaume, Professor of Architecture at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] for students of architecture, painting, sculpture, and engraving.

==History==
The [[bohemian]]s of [[Montmartre]] who modeled their pranks in the form of [[carnival]] were instrumental in initiating the Bal des Quat'z'Arts. It was one of the two controversial carnivals of the  1880s and 1890s, the other being the annual masked ball, held in the spring.{{sfn|Charney|Schwartz|1995|p=119}} The carnival was an annual event with different themes. It was held particularly for the students of the four branches of architecture, painting, sculpture, and engraving of the École des Beaux-Arts. It was considered a "riotous [[Saturnalia]]". The girls accompanying the students for the carnival painted their bodies and wore costumes over them which would eventually come off during the wild revelry.{{sfn|Guiton|1991|p=31}} The first ball was held in 1892 in Montmartre. It was modest when compared with later ones, and it was considered a success, though it was immediately put into the hands of organizers.

The second event was a costume ball held 9 February 1893 at the [[Moulin Rouge]]; along with merriment and drinking. [[Model (people)|Nude models]] walked about as living paintings and a nude woman was noted to be standing on a table at midnight.{{sfn|Ulmer|1994|p=60}}{{sfn|Whiting|1999|p=53}} A lawsuit arose thereafter.{{sfn|Bru|Thacker|2013|p=57}} [[Sarah Brown (artists' model)|Sarah Brown (née Marie or Marie-Florentine Roger or Royer)]], who posed as an [[atelier]] model, was arrested and fined for nudity after the Bal des Quat'z'Arts carnival in 1893. This led to student rioting in the [[Latin Quarter, Paris|Latin Quarter]]. Later, when her whereabouts could not be determined, it was conjectured that she had committed suicide.{{sfn|Jiminez|Banham|2001|p=86}}

Starting in 1900, the theme became singular &amp;ndash; ancient &amp;ndash; drawing on Greece and Homer. The theme was documented in invitations, programs and posters.{{sfn|Schwartz|Steiner|Sénéchal|2005|p=293}}

==Preparations==
Months were spent in the creation of floats and in the costuming of students and models. The favorite wit of the different ateliers was given the task of painting the banner of the atelier, which was carried at the head of the several corteges. Special instructions were issued to the different ateliers while preparations were in progress, such as this one from the ball of 1899:
:"Bal Des Quat-z' Arts, Moulin Rouge, 21 April 1899. Doors open at 10 P. M. and close at midnight. The card of admission is absolutely personal, to be taken by the committee before the opening of the ball. The committee will be masked, and comrades without their personal card will be refused at the door. The cards must carry the name and quality of the artist, and bear the stamp of his atelier. Costumes are absolutely necessary. The soldier—the dress suit, black or in color— the monk—the blouse—the domino—kitchen boy—loafer—bicyclist, and other nauseous types, are absolutely prohibited. Should the weather be bad, comrades are asked to wait in their carriages, as the committee in control cannot, under any pretext, neglect guarding the artistic effect of the ball during any confusion that might ensue. A great "feed" will take place in the grand hall; the buffet will serve as usual individual suppers and baskets for two persons. The committee wish especially to bring the attention of their comrades to the question of women, whose cards of admission must be delivered as soon as possible, so as to enlarge their attendance — always insufficient. Prizes (champagne) will be distributed to the ateliers who may distinguish themselves by the artistic merit and beauty of their female display. All the women who compete for these prizes will be assembled on the grand staircase before the orchestra. The nude, as always, is Prohibited!?! The question of music at the head of the procession is of the greatest importance, and those comrades who are musical will please give their names to the delegates of the ateliers. Your good-will in this line is asked for—any great worthless capacity in this line will do, as they always play the same tune, "Les Pompiers!" The Committee—1899."{{sfn|Smith|1901|p=73}}

==Description==
The four different ateliers each created various floats and corteges. Prizes were given for the most successful interpretations. A jury composed of painters and sculptors reviewed the costumes as each person entered the ball. If someone did not achieve the appropriate artistic standard, they were turned away. Tickets were not transferable. It was difficult for someone who was not an enrolled student in one of the four ateliers to enter the ball. The ball featured a procession of moving tableaux. When dawn approached the students formed a huge circle to watch the dancing that began in the morning hours. When the dance ended, there would be a shout, "Long live the Quat'z' Arts!" The ball closed at about seven in the morning. It was followed by a procession through the Latin Quarter, finally reaching the [[Palais du Louvre|Louvre]] where a general romp would occur. The march would resume over the [[Pont du Carrousel]], until the [[Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe|Théâtre de l'Odéon]] was reached, where the attendees would disband.{{sfn|Smith|1901|p=70-}}

==Modern revival==
In 2012 the Bal des Quat'z'Arts was revived on the initiative of [[Nicolas Bourriaud]] when director of the École des Beaux-Arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daniellatif.blog.lemonde.fr/2012/07/05/les-beaux-arts-relancent-le-bal-des-4zarts/ ''Les Beaux-Arts relancent le Bal des 4'z'arts'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bermuda Syndrome''''' is a [[PC game]] developed by [[Century Interactive]] and published by BMG Interactive in 1995. The game is similar in gameplay and appearance to the classic [[Flashback: The Quest for Identity|Flashback]] from 1992. The player controls the main character from a [[Third-person shooter|third person]] [[sidescrolling]] perspective.

==Plot and gameplay==
The main character is Jack Thompson, a member of a US air force [[strategic bomber]] squadron during [[World War II]]. During a mission above [[Germany]] his plane gets attacked by German fighters and catches fire. Somehow, a [[Portal (fiction)|portal]] opens up as the plane is going down, and it enters what is presumably a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] or an [[Alternate history|alternate timeline]]. Jack finds himself descending not upon the German countryside, but on a strange, unfamiliar jungle landscape. Meanwhile, on the ground, we see a tied up young woman, struggling to get loose as a gigantic [[carnivorous]] [[dinosaur]] approaches. Jack's plane luckily hits and [[decapitation|decapitates]] the creature, preventing the woman from being eaten. At the last second Jack bails out, and at the beginning of the game he dangles in his parachute from a tree, with a [[boot knife|boot-knife]] as his only weapon.
After cutting the woman loose, she is revealed to be a princess who was going to be sacrificed as an attempt to save her father's life. She becomes Jack's companion throughout the game. The adventure consists of a large number of static panels across which the player moves to solve puzzles and battle dinosaurs. Objects can be picked up, and using them in the right context is often required to progress to the next screen. Other problems are often solved by jumping or interacting with the princess.

==Reception==
[[Image:Bermudascreen.jpeg|thumb|Screenshot from the first panel of the game.]]
The game received mixed reviews. Most agreed however that the game's graphics were excellent for its time. Coming Soon Magazine wrote:

'''''Blood Alley''''' is a 1955 American seafaring [[Cold War]] [[adventure film]] drama from [[Warner Bros.]], shot in [[CinemaScope]] and Warnercolor. It was produced by [[John Wayne]], directed by [[William A. Wellman]], and stars Wayne and [[Lauren Bacall]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; September 21, 1955, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The ship of Captain Tom Wilder, an American Merchant Mariner, is seized by the Chinese Communists, and he is imprisoned for two years. He is helped to escape using bribery and then given the uniform of a Soviet army officer. He is transported to Chiku Shan village by a large Chinese man who will not divulge why he was broken out of prison.

The village headman, Mr. Tso, explains all to the captain when he arrives: Wilder has been recruited to transport the people of Chiku Shan out of Red China to the British port of [[Hong Kong]]. In order to do this Captain Wilder must use a stolen, wood-burning, flat-bottomed, 19th Century stern-wheel riverboat. He will also need to utilize his detailed memory of the China coast to make a handmade chart and use an unreliable magnetic compass by which to navigate. Finally, he must rely upon the determination of the villagers and use their other assets in order to escape to freedom.

Their plan has been underway for more than a year. The villagers have been gradually raising the bottom of their harbor channel with stones, in order to trap the local Red Chinese patrol boat once it has been lured inside. Sinking [[sampans]] loaded with rocks at the channel mouth will cause it to run aground and be trapped while the village makes its escape. They have also been quietly accumulating arms, ranging from [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine guns]] to [[Mosin–Nagant]] rifles and [[Nagant M1895|Nagant revolvers]]. They are forced to deal with the complication of the Communist Feng family, who must be brought along so they cannot inform on the rest of the villagers or be shot for allowing the escape.

The villagers include the riverboat's Chief Engineer, a U.S. Navy-trained marine engineer named Tack, who helps to take over and steal the steamboat ferry. Tack and Wilder bring the stern wheeler to Chiku Shan village, where she is loaded with furnace firewood and boiler water, provisioned, and given the name of the village.

Wilder is attracted to a tough and determined American named Cathy Grainger, whose father is  a medical missionary in Chiku Shan village. Dr. Grainger was recently murdered by the Red Chinese following his failed surgery on a political commissar. Wilder is forced to inform Cathy of her father's death just before the villagers leave Chiku Shan, to keep her from staying behind. She refuses to believe him.

Following their plan, the villagers lure the patrol boat into the harbor and trap it there. They flee down the coast, bluffing their way past a [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] destroyer, then disappearing into a fog bank, hiding by day and sailing by night. Along the way, the Fengs first poison the food supply and then during a storm attempt to take over the riverboat, an attempt that fails. During the storm, Cathy comes to terms with her feelings for and attraction to the gruff Captain Wilder.

Forced by a shortage of wood and fresh water, the ''Chiku Shan'' pulls into the Graveyard of Ships at Honghai Bay. Captain Wilder orders the wrecks stripped of wood for fuel and water siphoned from depressions and tanks for the boiler and for drinking water. A heavy timber plows through the stern wheel while mooring the steamboat, snapping one of its paddle blades. This forces Wilder to stay in the Graveyard longer than he had planned to repair it. At the same time, Cathy goes ashore and returns after learning that Wilder had told her the truth about her father's death. The Fengs are put off, only to be taken back aboard when the pursuing Red Chinese destroyer shells the Graveyard and sends its powered boats in search of the ferry, which has run into a marshy estuary and disappeared.

Due to the fact smoke would give away their position, the villagers both pole and tow the riverboat through miles of marshlands until they reach the open sea beyond the destroyer's search area. Tack fires up the boiler, and the ''Chiku Shan'' proceeds to Hong Kong with her 170-plus refugees. Her triumphant arrival there is greeted by the repeated sounding of steam whistles and ship's sirens from every vessel in the harbor.

==Production==
The film's screenplay was written by [[Sid Fleischman|Albert Sidney Fleischman]], based on his novel, and was produced by Wayne's [[Batjac Productions]]. Location filming took place in and near [[China Camp]], a shrimp fishing village in the [[San Francisco Bay]]. Additional filming occurred at Point Orient shrimp camp (located on Point San Pablo) where the film crew was largely based in what is now known as Point San Pablo Yacht Harbor.

The Chinese Communist soldiers who search the village are armed with Model 1891 Mosin–Nagant rifles (probably ex-[[Mosin–Nagant|U.S. Rifle, 7.62 mm, Model of 1916 rifles]]) rather than the more appropriate Model 91/30s the Communists would have carried, having been exported to Mao's army during the Chinese Civil War. The determination as to model can be made in the scene where Captain Wilder is shown watching Mr. Feng in his car with the Mosin–Nagant laid across his knees. The single blade front sight and thick barrel bands of the Model 1891 are unmistakable.

The real Blood Alley was located in [[Shanghai]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talesofoldchina.com/shanghai/places/t-blood.htm|title=Blood Alley|work=Tales of Old Shanghai|publisher=Earnshaw Books|accessdate=September 18, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011220656/http://www.talesofoldchina.com/shanghai/places/t-blood.htm|archivedate=October 11, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Fleischman had visited as a sailor on the [[USS Albert T. Harris (DE-447)]]. He was paid $5000 for the rights for his novel and was allowed to write the screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;pp 31-32 Freedman, Jeri ''Sid Fleischman'' 2003 Rosen Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt;

The Communist patrol boat that the villagers trap on their artificial reef was actually a rescue boat on loan to the film company by the U.S. Air Force.

==Casting==
Wayne plays a [[Merchant Marine]] captain in a role originally intended for [[Robert Mitchum]] prior to an altercation with the producers.  Mitchum was fired from the production by Wellman. Wayne took over the lead after [[Gregory Peck]] turned the film down and [[Humphrey Bogart]] requested a large amount of money to assume the role.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Swedish actress [[Anita Ekberg]], veteran actor [[Paul Fix]], and film thug [[Mike Mazurki]] all play [[Chinese people|Chinese]] roles.

==Promotion and critical reception==
The film was promoted by the appearance of Wayne on the number-one rated television show, ''[[List of I Love Lucy episodes|I Love Lucy]]''.  In an unusual two-episode arc airing as the show's season opener on October 10, 1955, Lucy and Ethel steal Wayne's footprints from the forecourt of [[Grauman's Chinese Theater]] the night before the premiere of ''Blood Alley'', and complications ensue. At one point early in the episode, a studio employee interrupts Wayne in his dressing room to show him a poster for ''Blood Alley''.

Despite the star power of its lead actors and director, ''Blood Alley'' received a lukewarm reception from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blood_alley/
 |title=Blood Alley |work= Rotten Tomatoes |publisher= Flixster, Inc. |accessdate=September 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "''Blood Alley'', despite its exotic, oriental setting, is a standard chase melodrama patterned on a familiar blueprint."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Formosa Strait|newspaper=The New York Times|location=New York City|page=25|publisher=The New York Times Corp.|date=October 6, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today's critics have focused on ''Blood Alley''{{'}}s anti-communist aspect. [[DVD Talk]] called it "preposterous but entertaining" and said, "Wayne and Bacall have no chemistry at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/15726/blood-alley/|first= Stuart|last= Galbraith |title=Blood Alley |work= DVD Talk Review  |publisher=dvdtalk.com |accessdate=September 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laurel &amp; Hardy in Flying Deuces 1 edited.png|thumbnail|right|[[Laurel and Hardy]] in the 1939 film ''[[The Flying Deuces]]''. Laurel and Hardy were one of the first pairings, appearing in buddy films from the 1930s onward.]]
The '''buddy film''' is a [[film genre]] in which two (or on occasion, more than two) people—often both men—are put together. The two often contrast in personality, which creates a different dynamic onscreen than a pairing of two people of the [[heterosociality|opposite gender]].{{Citation needed|reason=Subjective statement?|date=November 2018}} The contrast is sometimes accentuated by an ethnic difference between the two. The buddy film is commonplace in [[Cinema of the United States|American cinema]]; unlike some other film genres, it endured through the 20th century with different pairings and different themes.

==Male–male relationships==
{{anchor|Male-male relationships}}

A buddy film portrays the pairing of two people, often the same sex, historically men. A friendship between the two people is the key relationship in a buddy film. The two people often come from different backgrounds or have different personalities, and they tend to misunderstand one another. Through the events of the buddy film, they gain a stronger friendship and mutual respect. Buddy films often deal with crises of [[masculinity]], especially related to class, race, and gender. ''American Masculinities: A Historical Encyclopedia'' explains, "[Buddy films] offer male movie–going audiences an opportunity to indulge in a form of male bonding and behavior usually discouraged by social constraints."&lt;ref name="carroll"&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Carroll | editor-first=Bret E. | year=2003 | title=American Masculinities: A Historical Encyclopedia | publisher=SAGE Publications | isbn=978-0-7619-2540-8 | pages=73–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ira Konigsberg wrote in ''The Complete Film Dictionary'', "Such films extol the virtues of male comradeship and relegate male–female relationships to a subsidiary position."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Konigsberg | first=Ira | title=The Complete Film Dictionary | year=1998 | publisher=Penguin | isbn=978-0-14-051393-6 | page=41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 2001 called the genre "a necessary escapist fantasy", writing, "It's one of the few arenas where men can openly express their feelings for each other, even though men on screen today seem less comfortable with each other than ever before." In buddy films, the two men are markedly different, and their relationship with each other is challenged by events in the film. The two are often different enough that one is aggravated by the other. The interaction between two men also differs from the interaction between a man and a woman, which shapes a film's dynamics.&lt;ref name="still"&gt;{{cite news | last=Goldstein | first=Patrick | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/oct/09/entertainment/ca-54963/2 | title=It's Still a Guy Thing: The Evolution of Buddy Movies | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=October 9, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Kolker writes in ''A Cinema of Loneliness'', "The buddy complex views sexuality as an obstacle to manly acts. But this denial of sexuality carries a covert admission of the possibilities of homosexuality, which, of course, is inadmissible." Kolker says the main characters typically have relationships with female secondary characters who are relegated to the background.&lt;ref name="kolker"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kolker | first=Robert | year= | chapter= | title=A Cinema of Loneliness | publisher=Oxford University Press | pages=295–296 | isbn=978-0-19-973002-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1962 Italian film ''[[The Easy Life|Il sorpasso]]'' (English title: ''The Easy Life''), the characters Roberto and Bruno spend time together and grow emotionally attached. Sergio Rigoletto writes, "Their statements of emotional proximity are... always quite oblique... in doing so they comply with the dominant social conventions according to which the love between two men cannot be clearly spoken in films." While the characters do not have sex with women in the film, they express desire for heterosexual adventures. Women in the film are secondary characters and possess traits that negatively contrast them with the male–male relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bolton | first1=Lucy | last2=Manson | first2=Christina Siggers | year= | title=Italy on Screen | series=New Studies in European Cinema | publisher=Peter Lang | pages=19–20 | isbn=978-3-03911-416-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Female–female friendships==

A [[female buddy film]] is similar to a buddy film except that the main characters are female, and it is centered on their situation.  The cast may be mainly female depending on the plot. "The female buddy film is a recent trend in mainstream cinema. However, ''[[Thelma and Louise]]'' in the early ‘90s had a similar popular impact to ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'', paving the way for onscreen female friendships such as those in  ''[[Waiting to Exhale]]'' and ''[[Walking and Talking]],'' and the relationship between Evelyn Couch and Ninny Threadgoode in [[Fried Green Tomatoes (film)|''Fried Green Tomatoes'']]'',''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Hybrid genres==
Buddy films are often hybridized with other film genres, such as [[road movie]]s, [[Western (genre)|Western]]s, [[comedy film|comedies]], and [[action film]]s featuring cops. The "threats to [the] masculinity" of the male–male relationship depend on the genre: women in comedies, the law in films about outlaw buddies, and criminals in action films about cop buddies.&lt;ref name="carroll" /&gt;
&lt;!--

==Biracial pairings==
In some films, the contrast is particularly accentuated by a difference in race.&lt;ref name="still" /&gt;
--&gt;

==History==
===Pre-1930s===
The buddy film is more common to [[Cinema of the United States|cinema in the United States]] than cinema in other [[Western world|Western countries]], which tend to focus on male–female romantic relationships or an individual male hero.&lt;ref name="carroll" /&gt; Film historian [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] observes that buddy films are rare among British and French films, "You just wouldn't see three Englishmen behave the way American men do, who are truly happiest when they are together with other men." Portrayal of [[male bonding]] in the United States traces back to 19th-century author [[Mark Twain]]'s characters [[Huckleberry Finn|Huck Finn]] and [[Tom Sawyer]] as a "good boy-bad boy combo", as well as Huck Finn and the slave Jim in Twain's 1884 novel ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]''. [[Vaudeville]] acts in early 20th century United States often featured male pairs.&lt;ref name="still" /&gt;

===1930s to 1960s: Comedy duos===
From the 1930s to the 1960s in the United States, male [[double act|comedy duo]]s often appeared in buddy films. [[Laurel and Hardy]] and [[Abbott and Costello]] were popular in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name="carroll" /&gt; Laurel and Hardy starred in films like ''[[Sons of the Desert]]'' (1933), and Abbott and Costello starred in films like ''[[Buck Privates]]'' (1941). Another comedy duo was [[Wheeler &amp; Woolsey]], who starred in ''[[Half Shot at Sunrise]]'' (1930). [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Bob Hope]] starred together in the 1940 [[Paramount Pictures]] film ''[[Road to Singapore]]'',&lt;ref name="jewell"&gt;{{cite book | last=Jewell | first=Richard | year=2007 | chapter=Genres | title=The Golden Age of Cinema: Hollywood, 1929–1945 | publisher=Wiley–Blackwell | page=229 | isbn=978-1-4051-6372-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to other 1940s buddy films that the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described as "escapist wartime fantasies".&lt;ref name="still" /&gt; Hope and Crosby starred together in [[Road to …|a series of films]] that lasted to the 1960s.&lt;ref name="jewell" /&gt; [[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]] were a popular duo in the 1950s, and [[Walter Matthau]] and [[Jack Lemmon]] were famous in the 1960s, starring in the hit 1969 film ''[[The Odd Couple (film)|The Odd Couple]]''.&lt;ref name="carroll" /&gt;

A major departure from the more comic buddy films of the era was [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1949 [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese film]] ''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]'', starring [[Toshirō Mifune]] and [[Takashi Shimura]]. It was a more serious [[police procedural]] [[film noir]] that served as a precursor to the [[buddy cop film]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FilmInt|journal=Film International|year=2006|volume=4|issue=1-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y50qAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 April 2012|page=163|publisher=[[Arts Council Norway|Kulturrådet]]|location=Sweden|quote=In addition to being a masterful precursor to the buddy cop movies and police procedurals popular today, Stray Dog is also a complex genre film that examines the plight of soldiers returning home to post-war Japan.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s to 1970s: Responses to feminism and society===
{{double image|right|Richard Pryor (1986) (cropped).jpg|162|Gene Wilder 02.jpg|150|Richard Pryor (left, pictured in 1986) and Gene Wilder (right, pictured in 1984)}}
Throughout the 1960s and the 1970s, the [[feminist movement]] and "a widespread questioning" of social [[institution]]s influenced buddy films. The films explored male friendships more dramatically and encouraged [[individualism]]—particularly to be free from women and society.&lt;ref name="carroll" /&gt; Critics like [[Molly Haskell]] and [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] saw the decades' films as "a backlash from the feminist movement."&lt;ref name="abbott"&gt;{{cite book | last=Abbott | first=Stacey | year=2009 | title=Angel | series=TV Milestones | publisher=Wayne State University Press | pages=73–74 | isbn=978-0-8143-3319-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Philippa Gates wrote, "To punish women for their desire for equality, the buddy film pushes them out of the center of the narrative... By making both protagonists men, the central issue of the film becomes the growth and development of their friendship. Women as potential love interests are thus eliminated from the narrative space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Philippa | last=Gates |date=Spring 2004 | title=Always a Partner in Crime: Black Masculinity in the Hollywood Detective Film | journal=Journal of Popular Film and Television | volume=32 | issue=1 | pages=20–29 | doi=10.3200/JPFT.32.1.20-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The buddy films of these decades were also hybridized with [[road movie]]s.&lt;ref name="abbott" /&gt; The decades' buddy films included ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969), ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969), ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' (1969), ''[[Thunderbolt and Lightfoot]]'' (1974), and ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]'' (1975).&lt;ref name="carroll" /&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said films like ''[[Scarecrow (1973 film)|Scarecrow]]'' (1973) and ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'' (1974) reflected the "paranoia and alienation" felt in the era.&lt;ref name="still" /&gt; Beyond Hollywood, a notable buddy road movie of that era was the [[Bollywood]] "[[Curry Western]]" film ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mohideen|first=Nabeel|title=Ram Gopal Varma's `Aag' Pays Homage to a Bollywood Classic|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=az6l98g7dGv4&amp;refer=muse|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=29 April 2012|date=September 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the [[List of highest-grossing Bollywood films|highest-grossing Indian film]] of all time.&lt;ref name="boxoffice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sholay |url=http://www.ibosnetwork.com/asp/filmbodetails.asp?id=Sholay |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120630155123/http://www.ibosnetwork.com/asp/filmbodetails.asp?id=Sholay |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 June 2012 |publisher=International Business Overview Standard |accessdate=6 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adjusted&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=323&amp;catName=QWJvdXQgSW5mbGF0aW9uIERhdGE= |title=About Inflation Figures - BOI |publisher=Boxofficeindia.com |date= |accessdate=24 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106184319/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=323&amp;catName=QWJvdXQgSW5mbGF0aW9uIERhdGE%3D |archivedate=6 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biracial]] buddy films emerged in the 1970s and 1980s; [[Richard Pryor]] and [[Gene Wilder]] initiated the movement with ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'' (1976) and ''[[Stir Crazy (film)|Stir Crazy]]'' (1980). [[Eddie Murphy]] was a key actor in biracial buddy films, starring in ''[[48 Hrs.|48 Hours]]'' (1982) with [[Nick Nolte]] and in ''[[Trading Places]]'' (1983) with [[Dan Aykroyd]].&lt;ref name="chan"&gt;{{cite book | last=Chan | first=Kenneth | year=2009 | title=Remade in Hollywood: The Global Chinese Presence in Transnational Cinemas | publisher=Hong Kong University Press | pages=110–111 | isbn=978-962-209-056-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1980s, the individual roles in biracial buddy films are reversed. The "racial other... is too civilized" while the white man "is equipped for survival in... the urban landscape".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gates | first=Philippa | year=2011 | title=Detecting Women: Gender and the Hollywood Detective Film | publisher=State University of New York Press | pages=279–280 | isbn=978-1-4384-3405-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s: Action films and biracial pairings===
The 1980s was a popular decade for [[action film]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Duren | first=Brad L | year= | chapter=Donner, Richard | editor-last=Dimare | editor-first=Philip C | title=Movies in American History: An Encyclopedia | publisher=ABC-CLIO | page=630 | isbn=978-1-59884-296-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the genre that "blended masculinity, heroism, and patriotism into an idealized image" was hybridized with buddy films. Following the [[Civil Rights Movement]], black advancement was also reflected in more common biracial pairings.&lt;ref name="carroll" /&gt; In this decade, the buddy cop film took the place of the buddy road movie.&lt;ref name="abbott" /&gt; Action films with biracial pairings include the 1982 film ''[[48 Hrs.|48 Hours]]'' starring [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Nick Nolte]] and the 1987 film ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' starring [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Danny Glover]]. ''American Masculinities'' writes, "The African-American character is typically the sidekick to the white hero and isolated from the African-American community. He thus offers his skills and bravery for the preservation of mainstream (white) cultural values."&lt;ref name="carroll" /&gt; Another combination of the action film and the buddy film in the 1980s and another biracial reversal was the 1988 film ''[[Die Hard]]'' in which [[Bruce Willis]]'s heroic character [[John McClane]] is supported by the black cop Al (played by [[Reginald VelJohnson]]).&lt;ref name="kolker" /&gt;

===1990s: New approaches to the genre===
In the early 1990s, the masculine figure in films became more sensitive, and some buddy films "contemplated a masculinity that required sensitive relations between men". Such films included ''[[The Fisher King]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'' (1994). The decade also saw new approaches to the genre. The 1991 film ''[[Thelma &amp; Louise]]'' featured a female pairing of [[Geena Davis]] and [[Susan Sarandon]], and the 1993 film ''[[The Pelican Brief (film)|The Pelican Brief]]'' featured a male–female platonic pairing of [[Julia Roberts]] and [[Denzel Washington]]. The 1998 film ''[[Rush Hour (1998 film)|Rush Hour]]'' featured a nonwhite male pairing of [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Chris Tucker]],&lt;ref name="carroll" /&gt; which the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said symbolized [[color blindness (race)|color blindness]] in American cinema.&lt;ref name="still" /&gt;

Biracial buddy films continued in the 1990s and 2000s and were combined with different genres, such as ''[[Another 48 Hrs.|Another 48 Hours]]'' (1990), ''[[White Men Can't Jump]]'' (1992), ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994), ''[[Wild Wild West]]'' (1999), ''[[Miami Vice (film)|Miami Vice]]'' (2006) and the [[Men in Black (film series)|''Men in Black'']] series, {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Also in the 1990s and 2000s, [[John Woo]]'s Hollywood films imported the ''[[wuxia]]'' "themes of loyalty and trust" from his previous Hong Kong-produced films to create different takes on male bonding. Kin–Yan Szeto writes in ''The Martial Arts Cinema of the Chinese Diaspora'', "[In] his third Hollywood film, ''[[Face/Off]]''... Woo manages to deploy and politicize themes of homosociality with the possibility of contesting hegemonic masculinity that consolidates kinship and family." Woo's 2001 World War II film ''[[Windtalkers]]'' depicted two buddy pairs, with each pair indicating inequality through ethnicity (white American soldiers protecting [[code talker#Navajo code talkers|Navajo code talkers]] but ready to kill the talkers to protect the code). Szeto explains, "Woo uses the twin buddy pairs to explore the shifting meanings and multiple possibilities in interracial bonding, rather than simply recuperating and empowering dominant positions for white heterosexual men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Szeto | first=Kin–Yan | year=2011 | chapter=Facing Off East and West in the Cinema of John Woo | title=The Martial Arts Cinema of the Chinese Diaspora: Ang Lee, John Woo, and Jackie Chan in Hollywood | publisher=Southern Illinois University Press | pages=89,103 | isbn=978-0-8093-3021-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''BuzzFeed Unsolved''''' (also known as simply '''''Unsolved''''') is an American documentary entertainment television series created and produced by Ryan Bergara. It originally aired on [[YouTube]] on February 4, 2016, and has run for eight seasons.&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2017/10/06/trailer-season-buzzfeed-unsolved-supernatural/|title=Watch Season 3 Trailer of BuzzFeed Unsolved Supernatural|first=Jessica|last=Klein|publisher=TubeFilter|date=6 Oct 2017|accessdate=18 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/arts/buzzfeed-supernatural-investigators-visit-denton-bridge-to-see-if-its-really-haunted-by-a-half-goat-half-demon-10051546|title=Denton Urban Legend Put to the Test on Buzzfeed Web Series|first=Caroline|last=North|publisher=Dallas Observer|date=9 Nov 2017|accessdate=18 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''BuzzFeed Unsolved'' follows Ryan Bergara and co-host Shane Madej who discuss unsolved crimes, haunted places, alleged demonic possessions and historical occurrences. While the topics of discussion are often morbid, most episodes are presented in some form of a comedic manner.&lt;ref name=Gorsek&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/buzzfeeds-one-redeeming-quality-is-this-series|title=BuzzFeed's One Redeeming Quality Is This Series|first=Stephanie|last=Gorsek|publisher=The Odyssey|date=4 Sep 2017|accessdate=18 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show is filmed primarily in [[Los Angeles]] with some episodes having parts filmed across the U.S, and even some in other countries. 

The show has also become a ratings hit for [[BuzzFeed]], regularly featuring as one of the network's most-watched shows. Prior to the premiere of the eighth season, BuzzFeed renewed the show for a ninth season, set to air in late 2018.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commdiginews.com/entertainment/buzzfeed-unsolved-amazon-prime-101007/|title=Buzzfeed: Unsolved: Paranormal playtime streaming on Amazon Prime|date=2018-04-15|work=Communities Digital News|access-date=2018-04-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The show's success has also spawned a spin-off dedicated to sports, which airs on [[Facebook Watch]]. Bergara and Zack Evans host the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2017/12/11/buzzfeed-facebook-watch-worth-it-spin-off-quinta-vs-everything/|title=BuzzFeed Unveils Facebook Watch Slate, Including ‘Worth It’ Spin-Off, ‘Quinta Vs.

== Synopsis ==
The ''Buzzfeed Unsolved: True Crime'' and ''Supernatural'' shows are currently co-hosted by Ryan Bergara and Shane Madej. Madej took over from the original co-host, Brent Bennett, in late 2016.&lt;ref name="Gorsek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Medium"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@lauren_victoria/hey-demons-its-me-ya-boi-how-buzzfeed-unsolved-is-bringing-out-the-pseudo-sleuths-in-all-of-968cd54b2c18|title=“Hey Demons, it’s me… ya boi” – how Buzzfeed Unsolved is bringing out the pseudo-sleuths in all of us.|last=Entwistle|first=Lauren|date=21 Sep 2017|publisher=Medium|accessdate=18 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest difference between Bennett and Madej lay in their responses to Bergara's theories: unlike Bennett, who would humor Bergara, Madej stands firm as a skeptic; this stark dichotomy proved the missing piece of the puzzle for the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/47452-buzzfeed-unsolved-spoilers-interview-ryan-bergara-shane-madej|accessdate=2018-09-11|title="The Internet's Funniest Ghost Hunters Aren't Going to Solve Anything}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important members of the main Unsolved crew include TJ Marchbank, 1st AD, Devon Joralman, line producer, and cameraman Mark Celestino. 

The contrast between Bergara's belief in conspiracies and the paranormal versus Madej’s skepticism provides the majority of the dialogue.&lt;ref name="Pellock"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/buzzfeed-unsolved-great-show-watch-halloween-season|title="BuzzFeed Unsolved" Is A Great Show To Watch This Halloween Season|last=Pellock|first=Megan|date=25 Oct 2017|publisher=The Odyssey|accessdate=18 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Medium" /&gt; Bergara strongly believes in otherworldly spirits like ghosts or poltergeists, and frequently defends the existence of these throughout the series. However, Bergara shows reluctance towards things such as Bigfoot and sometimes aliens. Madej is a true skeptic of all that is non-scientific and constantly provides comedic relief toward spiritual encounters. Still he tends to regard [[Bigfoot]] and aliens as somewhat realistic or grounded in reality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Guests ===
In ''BuzzFeed Unsolved: Supernatural'' Season 4 ''[[Ancient Aliens]]'' contributor [[Giorgio A. Tsoukalos|Giorgio Tsoukalos]] was featured in the discussion about a potential UFO sighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/ryansbergara/status/997603256560902145|title=Ryan Bergara on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recurring guest on the show, in person and by mentions is a "[[Vatican City|Vatican]] approved [[exorcist]]" Father Gary Thomas, who counsels the hosts how to and how not to approach the entities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ricky Goldsworth, Ryan’s serial killer alter ego, sometimes emerges during the episodes.

==The Hot Daga==
The "Hot Daga" is a animated mini show series shown at the end of Post Mortem episodes, created, written and narrated by host Shane Madej.&lt;ref&gt;/www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPfbqY4REL&lt;/ref&gt;  The first episode of the Hot Daga Saga began at the end of the Post Mortem episode "The Boy in the Box - Q+A".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPfbqY4REL8&lt;/ref&gt; Although at the beginning of episodes Madej jokes that the show is commissioned by  Madej's cohost Ryan Bergara, Bergara is infamously not a fan of the series. However Bergara listens to the gripping show as it is narrated to the audience. &lt;ref&gt;twitter.com/ryansbergara/status/913512053624549376&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPfbqY4REL8&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Notable characters include Pam, the evil hotdog witch, Gene, the wonderfully written french fries, Maizie, a hologram lesbian corn, and the Plupples (fruits that are like peaches, but sexier and blue). Another character, Dr. Goondis, is voiced by Ryan against his will, as Shane Madej spliced many of his dialogues from Unsolved and connected them to create the voice of the character. The series originated when Madej jokingly wanted a [[Skateboarding|skate boarding]] [[hot dog]] at the end of a Q + A episode, and it has grown to multiple mini-episodes and musical numbers. Fans of the series have also made season compilations on YouTube for other fans to watch the shorts in their entirety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=maisie|title=The Hot Daga Season One - BuzzFeed Unsolved|date=2017-10-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeKHSfJa3D0|accessdate=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Charlton Bullseye''''' was the title of a short-lived [[Charlton Comics]] showcase [[comic book]] series published from June [[1981 in comics|1981]] through December [[1982 in comics|1982]]. Several new stories using Charlton's "Action Heroes" appeared, before they were sold to [[DC Comics]] in [[1983 in comics|1983]]. After the cancellation of ''Charlton Bullseye'', stories intended for the title were published in ''[[Scary Tales (comics)|Scary Tales]]'' #36–40, which explains the superhero story "Mr. Jigsaw" in issue #38 and "Dragon Force" in issue #40. Several other unpublished stories for the title were published by [[AC Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Borax, Mark | date = July 1986 | title = Bill Black | journal = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 36 | pages = 52–65 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1980 press release for the series, an artist showed up at the Charlton offices and offered to work for them for free in hopes of accumulating enough credits to get a job with one of the two leading comics publishers. ''Charlton Bullseye'' was based around this concept; contributors to the series were paid only in contributor copies, all original art was returned to the artists after publication, and contributors would hold the copyrights to any original characters they introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greenberger|first=Robert|title=New Talent and Bonus Babies|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71 |page=65|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attempted revivals==
In 1985, a final attempt at a revival was spearheaded by new editor T.C. Ford with a direct-market only version of ''Charlton Bullseye Special'', which featured work by then newcomers [[Amanda Conner]], T.C. Ford, and Chris Pridgen. United Comics, T.C. Ford's publishing house, will reprint this edition as ''Shockwave'' #1 in 2016.

The '''cinema of [[Tunisia]]''' has been present since 1896, when the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] began showing animated films in the streets of [[Tunis]].

==History==
In 1919, the first feature-length movie produced on the North African continent: ''Les Cinq gentlemen maudits'' (''The Five Accursed Gentlemen'') was filmed in Tunisia. In 1924, Samama-Chikli directed a medium-length film called ''Ain Al-Ghazal'' (''The Girl from Carthage'') thus making him, one of the very first native filmmakers on the North African continent.&lt;ref name="cff"&gt;[http://www.jccarthage.org/eng/cinema_tunisien.php History of Tunisian Cinema] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028003651/http://www.jccarthage.org/eng/cinema_tunisien.php |date=2008-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, the first feature Tunisian film (95 minutes) ''Al-Fajr'' (''The Dawn'') was directed and produced by [[Omar Khlifi]]; it was shot on a [[35 mm film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.africine.org/?menu=fiche&amp;no=7202 AfriCiné profile of Omar Khlifi]&lt;/ref&gt; Tunisia also hosts the [[Carthage Film Festival]] which has been taking place since 1966. The festival gives priority to films from Arab and African countries. It is the oldest film festival on the African continent and the Arab World.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Carthage_Film_Festival/ Carthage Film Festival Page on IMDB]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, the first Tunisian film distribution company, Tunis-Film, started its activities. After independence, movies were exclusively produced by [[Société Anonyme Tunisienne de Production et d'Expansion Cinématographique]] (SATPEC) which controlled cinema and filming productions in the country at the time. Nevertheless, during the 1980s, private production companies and studios emerged and wanted to make Tunisia the Mediterranean Hollywood. The producer [[Tarak Ben Ammar]], a nephew of [[Wasila Bourguiba]], succeeded in attracting some big production companies to shoot inside his studios in [[Monastir, Tunisia|Monastir]]. Major foreign movies were filmed in Tunisia including [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Pirates (1986 film)|Pirates]]'' and [[Franco Zeffirelli]]'s ''[[Jesus of Nazareth (miniseries)|Jesus of Nazareth]]''. After visiting Tunisia [[George Lucas]] was seduced by the natural beauty and authentic old architecture of some Southern Tunisian towns where he decided to film important scenes of ''[[Star Wars]]'', as well as ''Indiana Jones''. Moreover, [[Anthony Minghella]] filmed the nine [[Academy Awards]] winner ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' in a south-west oasis of the country.

When it comes to domestic productions, they were rare: the few movies which were produced since 1967 tried to reflect the new social dynamics, development, identity research and modernity shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://guides.tangka.com/tunisie/Chapt8Sub1.htm Un cinéma dynamique (Tangka Guide)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007040510/http://guides.tangka.com/tunisie/Chapt8Sub1.htm |date=2011-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them achieved a relative success outside Tunisia such as ''La Goulette'' (''Halq El-Wadi'' 1996) directed by [[Ferid Boughedir]] which showed a flashback of typical community life in the small suburb of La Goulette in a period where Muslims, Jews and Christians lived together in tolerance and peace. ''Halfaouine: Child of the Terraces'' (''Asfour Stah'' 1990), from the same director Boughdir is possibly the biggest popular success in the history of Tunisian Cinema. The movie showed the life of a child from Tunis (Halfouine suburb) in the 60s who was on a quest to understand relationships, the world of women and how to be a man. In another earlier movie entitled [[Man of Ashes]] (''Rih Essedd'' 1986) Boughdir was as always depicting Tunisian society without fear or favour and talked about prostitution, paedophilia and inter-faith relations between Tunisian Muslims and Tunisian Jews. In the 1991's film ''Bezness'', he talked about the emerging sexual tourism inside the country. ''[[Les Ambassadeurs (film)|The Ambassadors]]'' (As-Soufraa 1975) directed by [[Naceur Ktari]] portrayed the life of immigrant [[Maghrebins]] in France and their struggle against racism. The film won the Golden Tanit for the best picture during the Carthage Film Festival in 1976, the special jury award from the [[Locarno International Film Festival]] in the same year and it has been classified in the ''Un Certain Regard'' category during the 1978 [[Cannes Film Festival]].

The first Tunisian actress was [[Haydée Tamzali|Haydée Chikly]], who starred in the short film, ''Zohra'' in 1922. The first feature film to be directed by a woman was ''Fatma 75'' (1975) by [[Selma Baccar]]. Subsequent female directors films such as [[Néjia Ben Mabrouk]]'s ''[[Sama (film)|Sama]]'' (1988) and [[Moufida Tlatli]]'s ''[[The Silences of Palace]]'' (1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chikhaoui |first=Tahar |title=Selma, Nejia, Moufida and the others |url=http://www.africultures.com/php/index.php?nav=livre&amp;no=2091 |journal=[[Ecrans d'Afrique]] |date=May 1994 |issue=8 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, several films were produced and grabbed public attention such as ''Making Of'' directed by Nouri Bouzid and Nejib Belkadi's ''VHS Kahloucha''.

In 2013, [[Abdellatif Kechiche]] was the first-ever Tunisian director to win the [[Palme D'Or]] award. For his film ''[[Blue Is the Warmest Colour]]'' he split the award with his two lead actresses.

On March 21, 2018, the country opened its first [[City of Culture (Tunisia)|City of Culture]], a project one of its kind in [[Africa]] and the [[Arab world]] , located in downtown [[Tunis]]. The complex contains several theaters, cinemas, screens, art and history galeries, exhibition halls, a contemporary and modern art museum, a national book centre and a cultural investment centre. 
&lt;ref name="City of culture Tunis"&gt;{{cite web|title=TUNISIA INAUGURATES CITY OF CULTURE | publisher=[[Tunis Daily News]] |url=http://tdailynews.net/story-z9919400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2018, there were 22 screens all across [[Tunisia]].

The first ever [[Multiplex (movie theater)|Cineplex]] in [[Tunisia]] is set to open in [[Tunis City]] in [[Tunis]] in summer 2018, it will consist of 8 screeens and will be operated by [[Les Cinémas Gaumont Pathé]].&lt;ref name="Pathé Tunis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Rules for the Best Foreign Language Film Award |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |url=http://www.businessnews.com.tn/coup-denvoi-officiel-des-travaux-de-construction-du-1er-cinema-multiplexe-pathe-a-tunis-city,520,73539,3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other multiplexes are set to open by [[Les Cinémas Gaumont Pathé]] in the coming years, one containing 8 screens at new [[Azur city mall]] in Banlieu Sud of Tunis&lt;ref name="Pathé Azur City"&gt;{{cite web|title=Azur City Tunis |publisher=[[Azur City]] |url=Azurcity.tn,520,73539,3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of 6 screens in [[Sousse]].

As of July 2018, there are 24 screens all across [[Tunisia]].

==Academy Award nominations==
{{main|List of Tunisian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film }}

'''Dance science''' is the scientific study of [[dance]] and dancers, as well as the practical application of scientific principles to dance. Its aims are the enhancement of [[performance]], the reduction of [[injury]], and the improvement of [[well-being]] and [[health]].

[[Dance and health|Dance medicine and science]] as a field of study developed in the 1970s and 80s out of the field of [[sports medicine]]. In the early 1980s, the American Dance Festival (ADF) started including dance medicine courses in their course work for dancers. When ADF moved to Duke University, physicians from Duke University Hospital became interested in dancers. Then, in 1990, the International Association for Dance Medicine and Science ([[IADMS]])  was formed by an international group of dance medicine practitioners, dance educators, dance scientists, and dancers. Membership of IADMS began with 48 members in 1991, and has grown to over 900 members in 35 countries as of 2016.&lt;ref name=IADMSabout&gt;{{cite web|author=International Association for Dance Medicine &amp; Science |url=http://www.iadms.org/?page=A8 |title=About IADMS |publisher=iadms.org |accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dance science as an academic discipline has been evolving over the past 20 years.{{when|date=November 2018}} In the United Kingdom, three degrees (at master's level) now exist: one at the University of Bedfordshire,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beds.ac.uk/howtoapply/courses/postgraduate/next-year/dance-science University of Bedfordshire]&lt;/ref&gt; one at the [[University of Wolverhampton]], and one at the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in London. With regards to dance science research, another UK institution which has staff and students active in the area is [[the University of Birmingham]].   Some undergraduate degrees in dance, or other dance courses, also include one or several modules in dance science, with the aim of promoting healthy dance practices. These include the [[University of Wolverhampton]], the [[Royal Academy of Dance]], and [[Bird College]].

Several universities in the United States also offer dance science courses as part of their dance curriculum, accommodating both undergraduate and graduate level students. These include, but are not limited to: Cornish College of the Arts, Columbia College of Chicago, California State - Long Beach, Elon University, Florida State University, [[Goucher College]], Long Island University - Brooklyn Campus, Ohio State University, Ohio University, UCLA - Irvine, University of Colorado, University of Illinois - Urbana Champagne, and the University of Oregon.

Typically, the subject areas within dance science are similar to those studied in "[[sports science]]", though naturally with a focus on dance and the special considerations that this involves. They include: [[physiology]], [[anatomy]], [[kinesiology]], [[psychology]], [[biomechanics]], [[nutrition]], and similar. However, unlike sports science, dance science sometimes also studies related topics such as [[creativity]] and somatic techniques, including the practices of [[Pilates]], [[yoga]], [[Alexander technique]], [[Feldenkrais method]], etc.

Some dance companies employ dance scientists to provide support services, such as physiological testing, psychological support, conditioning and nutritional counseling. Such professionals include physical therapists, nutritionists, pilates instructors, massage therapists, and dance medicine physicians. Dancers that are not employed by a dance company that offers rehabilitation benefits on-site can sometimes have access to such facilities within their city of residence. Dancers in New York City have access to The Harkness Center for Dance Injuries, located at the NYU-Hospital for Joint Diseases, NYU Langone Medical Center, which offers many subsidized and free services for the dance community. These services include "clinics staffed by orthopedists and dance physical therapists; state-of-the art research and rehabilitation technology and free injury prevention screenings and lectures."  Westside Physical Therapy, directed and founded by Marika Molnar - the first physical therapist hired by the New York City Ballet - is another example of a physical therapy clinic in New York City that offers specialized care to dancers (as well as to non-dancers).

The largest organization promoting dance science internationally is the International Association for Dance Medicine and Science ([[IADMS]]). As well as producing a scientific peer-reviewed journal, ''Journal of Dance Medicine and Science'', it also holds an annual conference. The Performing Arts Medicine Association (PAMA), which holds its annual symposium in Aspen-Snowmass, Colorado, is a unique organization that concerns itself with the injuries and health issues of musicians as well as dancers. In the UK, DanceUK is perhaps the foremost proponent of dance science and healthy dance practice more generally. A conference entitled "From Cognition to Conditioning" was held at [[Middlesex University]] in February 2007.

==General information==
During the second series of ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'' on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] it was announced that the show would be taken on a UK arena tour. The tour would be presented by former contestant and ''Dancing on Ice Exclusive'' host [[Andi Peters]] and would feature contestants from all the UK and 1 Australian series of the show competing against each other for audience votes (cast via SMS). Each contestant performed two solo routines for the judges (one was scored by the judges) ([[Nicky Slater]], [[Jason Gardiner]], [[Karen Barber]], [[Robin Cousins]] and a guest judges which varied at each location). The two couples with the most votes then proceeded into the 'Bolero Dance-Off'. Following the completion of the dance-off the judges would select a winner decided by a majority verdict. At the end of each show the winner received a trophy. The live show also featured numerous performances from [[Jayne Torvill]] and [[Christopher Dean]] as well as the professional ice skaters (from the television series) and other special guests.

The Dancing on Ice Live Tour began on 31 March 2007 and ended on 6 May 2007.

The Sheffeld tour was recorded for the DVD (which was released on 19 November 2007). A preview of the tour was also broadcast on ITV on 21 October 2007. The celebrity guest judges included Radio 1's DJ Letitia, [[Ian Watkins (Steps)|Ian Watkins]] of [[Steps (group)|Steps]] and ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 5 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'', former competitor [[Stephen Gately]], and actress [[Susie Amy]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
At the age of ten, Tenaglia first started to collect records. In 1979, he began going to nightclub [[Paradise Garage]], where DJ [[Larry Levan]]'s genre-less blend of music appealed to him. This was the club model Tenaglia would one day emulate: Levan's bold style, the venue's plain décor, and the party's warmth and inclusiveness.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Tenaglia left New York in 1985 and started DJ-ing in [[Miami]] as a resident at Cheers nightclub, playing classic New York and Chicago house. He returned to New York five years later. At this time, he started to create some remixes, including [[Right Said Fred]]'s "[[I'm Too Sexy]]" (1991), [[Jamiroquai]]'s "[[Emergency on Planet Earth]]" (1993), and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[Human Nature (Madonna song)|Human Nature]]" (1994).

===DJ career===
Tenaglia's first mainstream success was with a remix of [[The Daou]]'s "Surrender Yourself" (1993). The title of his 1995 debut artist album on New York's TRIBAL America/IRS Records described the genre as ''Hard &amp; Soul''.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Tenaglia cited his influences ranged from [[Patti LaBelle]] to [[Kraftwerk]], with many lesser-known soul, R&amp;B, Latin, samba and disco artists in between.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Subsequent to this Tenaglia released three  label compilations - ''Mix This Pussy'' (1994) and ''Can Your Pussy Do The Dog?'' (1995) for TRIBAL, and ''Gag Me with a Tune'' (1996) for Maxi.

===As a producer===
In 1996, after working for a short time at the New York nightclub Roxy, Tenaglia started a Saturday night residency at Twilo, a position that brought him some public attention. Contrary to the music popular in New York at the time, Tenaglia was producing the more minimal, tech-y grooves originating in European production studios. This period produced remixes like Grace's "Not Over Yet" (1996) and Janet Jackson's "The Pleasure Principle" (1996).  In 1998, he moved his residency over to NY club Tunnel.

In 1998, Danny released another full-length LP titled ''Tourism''.  The album featured the notable track "Elements". With his own warped voice providing the narration, "Elements" walked the listener through the different components of a dance track in real time, going from kick to drum loop to snare hit, letting each layer over the other until the track exploded with dark, drum-heavy energy.  "Elements" was #1 on the Billboard Dance Chart for two weeks in 1998. "Music is the answer" featuring Celeda (also on the LP Tourism) was on the top 40 charts in the UK. Next to ostentatious radio anthems, its simplicity was a revelation.

The release of his first installment in the UK-based Global Underground series of DJ mixes, titled Athens (2000), was well received. Back in New York, Tenaglia grew tired of Tunnel and sought a venue more similar to the Paradise Garage. He landed at Vinyl, a black-walled, single-environment, no-liquor club about one-quarter the size of Tunnel. He named the night "Be Yourself," after the self-affirming, heavy-bottomed vocal track he had recently recorded with Chicago's Celeda.

In 2000, Tenaglia's annual party during Miami's Winter Music Conference outgrew its home at the cramped Groovejet and moved to just-opened superclub Space. DJ giants like Carl Cox danced on top of the speakers with the Deep Dish boys, Fatboy Slim mingled on the patio, and for a day the ego inherent to DJ culture evaporated: Tenaglia was hailed as the "DJ's DJ." His revamp of Green Velvet's "Flash" won "Best Remix" at the UK's Muzik Awards, where he was also awarded the "Best International DJ" prize.

In the two years that followed, Tenaglia released another Global Underground installment titled London, remixed Billy Nichols' "Give Your Body Up To The Music" (a Garage anthem); got nominated for a Grammy (for his remix of Depeche Mode's "I Feel Loved," also nominated for Best Dance Song) and won a Dancestar Lifetime Achievement award.

In 2003, Danny came full circle with the release of Choice: A Collection Of Classics, a two-CD mixed compilation that let him pay direct tribute to many of the artists who had influenced his sound and style. It featured artists such as Blaze, Adeva and Imagination, along with his own liner notes explaining the significance of each track. He also remixed another Garage classic (Yoko Ono's "Walking On Thin Ice," which became her first Billboard number one ever), opened another Space during Winter Music Conference (the new location down the block), and took another Dancestar award, this time 'Best Party' for "Be Yourself."

"Be Yourself" took the same honor again in 2004, but by this time, Vinyl, now called Arc, had already been sold to condo developers. Danny closed the club on Sunday, April 25, 2004.

=== Present day ===

Since then Danny has remained prolific in the clubs and has played in NYC locations including Avalon, Crobar, Pacha NYC, Roxy and Webster Hall. In 2007, Tenaglia participated in the [[Dance parade]]. After a long studio silence, Danny re-emerged in 2008 with a single on Tommy Boy Records, "The Space Dance". It was named in honor of his first weekly residency during the summer season of 2008 at renowned global clubbing institution Space Ibiza.  The track reached number 1 on the Billboard Club Charts during November 2008.

Immediately following that, Danny released his first compilation album in five years, entitled Futurism, also on Tommy Boy Records, with a nod to the modern dance floor and Danny's outlook for tomorrow's sounds.  The compilation featured tracks from artists whom Danny had been championing for several years including [[Davide Squillace]], The Wighnomy Brothers and Afefe Iku.  On January 24, 2016, Danny was the closing DJ of yet another club, Pacha NYC.  At the end of his 7-hour set, while taking requests, he made reference to his multiple club-closings, by rejecting some songs by stating that they were already played at the closing of Vinyl / Arc and others.

After over 30 years of DJing Danny still continues to tour around the world.  His commitment to playing new music and incorporating it with music from his past is still a very big part of his performances.

==2005 - 48th Annual Grammy Awards Nominee==
Category: Best Musical Show Album&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/awards/grammys/2005-12-08-grammy-list-nominations_x.htm  USATODAY.com - 2005 Grammy nominees (see #79)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other 2005 nominees were ''Hair'', ''The Light in the Piazza'', ''The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee'', and ''Monty Python's Spamalot'', with ''Spamalot'' taking home the Grammy on February 8, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=&amp;winner=&amp;year=2005&amp;genreID=0&amp;hp=1 Grammy.com - Grammy Awards 2005 winner search (select Genre: Musical Show)]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- My Grammy Awards calendar year usage ratinale: I see that Wikipedia Grammy articles differ from this one as far as Grammy Awards and calendar year, with (for example) the wiki page for the 48th Annual Grammy Awards being referred to as "Grammy Awards of 2006."  While the 48th Annual Grammy award ceremony took place in 2006, it would actually be more correct to refer to the 48th Annual Grammy Awards as "2005 Grammy Awards, Presented Feb. 8, 2006".  That would correctly identify that year's awards while also stating when that year's awards were presented. Go to Grammy.com and see how they list award winners. I'm using their dating method here in trying to be as accurate as possible with the info on this page. --&gt;

==History==
Founded by Rachel Jacobson in 2005, Film Streams' mission is to enhance the cultural environment of the Omaha-Council Bluffs area through the presentation and discussion of film as an art form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmstreams.org/mission-history|title=Film Streams — Mission &amp; History|last=Shapes|first=Justin Kemerling and Human|date=2017-11-15|website=Film Streams|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, Film Streams opened the Ruth Sokolof Theater, a new two-screen cinema in [[downtown Omaha]]'s North Downtown ([[NoDo]]) area,&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Omaha-TrainYards"&gt;{{cite news|last=Davila|first=Stephanie|title=SURFACING; In Omaha, From Train Yards to Playground|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E2DB133EF93AA25755C0A9679D8B63|accessdate=14 November 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  within a development anchored by internationally acclaimed music label [[Saddle Creek Records]].&lt;ref name="NYT-2008"&gt;{{cite news|last=Konigsberg|first=Eric|title=When Omaha Met Cinema|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/movies/16koen.html|accessdate=14 November 2013|date=March 16, 2008|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-Omax-Culture-2007"&gt;{{cite news|last=Andersen|first=Kurt|title=Omaha’s Culture Club|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/travel/tmagazine/03talk.omaha.t.html|accessdate=14 November 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, Film Streams announced that [[Susan Alice Buffett|Susie Buffett]]'s Sherwood Foundation had donated the 92-year-old Dundee Theater to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.omaha.com/go/arts/sherwood-foundation-will-donate-dundee-theater-to-film-streams-with/article_8d1169bd-5624-5588-983b-8ec7b68fd6a0.html|title=Sherwood Foundation will donate Dundee Theater to Film Streams, with spotlight on 2018 reopening|last=writer|first=Micah Mertes / World-Herald staff|work=Omaha.com|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization launched a public capital campaign in April 2017 with the intention of renovating and reopening the cinema by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.omaha.com/go/movies/film-streams-nears-million-fundraising-goal-for-dundee-theater-renovations/article_97c86342-aa18-5c17-8ef0-654ae796f148.html|title=Film Streams nears $8.3 million fundraising goal for Dundee Theater renovations|last=writer|first=Micah Mertes / World-Herald staff|work=Omaha.com|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Film Streams" is inspired by Omaha (the word means "above all others on a stream") and the [[John Cassavetes]] film, ''[[Love Streams (film)|Love Streams]].''&lt;ref name="FS-FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)|url=http://filmstreams.org/filmstreams_about_faq.asp|work=Film Streams|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Photo of Flip Flap car ornament.jpg|thumb|Photo of "Q" type Flip Flap car ornament]]
[[Image:Flip Flap.JPG|right|thumb]]

'''Flip Flap''' is a [[solar powered]] toy that resembles a plant.

The small solar panel powers two leaves that bounce up and down continuously until the light source to the solar panel is stopped. The leaves can be stopped from bouncing by a switch on the underside of the device.

The Flip Flap has a large cult following in [[Japan]], but the popularity of the ornamental gadget is growing in the UK being marketed under the [[Tomy]] brand. Flip Flaps come in different models like the "Q" (which is round) and "F" (which has the shape of a flower pot). The big Flip Flaps (depends on the number) usually have three movements. Once you turn it on, the leaves begin to move up and down. If you tap one of the leaves, it shall begin to move seesaw to the direction in which the leaf was tapped.

As with other Tomy manufactured solar powered toys, there are fake Flip Flaps being sold in stores. These are often cheaply made in China and are limited to only an up-and-down motion, and are incapable of the 3 different movements characteristic of authentic Flip Flaps. The fake and real versions look extremely similar, but consumers can differentiate between the two by looking for the Tomy logo, almost entirely Japanese characters on the box (limited English), and dark green leaves (fake Flip Flaps have light green leaves, as opposed to the darker, real ones of slightly better quality). Other Flip Flap knockoffs are sold that are solely inspired by Flip Flaps, but not directly based on Flip Flaps, as they are sold in very different packaging than the authentic ones and have flowers that look different.

According to the EU patent database,&lt;ref&gt;http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?adjacent=true&amp;KC=A&amp;date=20090128&amp;NR=101352268A&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;CC=CN&amp;FT=D&lt;/ref&gt; the patent was copied by a small Chinese company called "SHENZHEN LONGGANG PINGHU TENGY". It seems that Tomy has sold the licence to market this product as "Flip Flap" in EU and the Chinese company infringed the copyright. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.

The electronics for this toys is well known and was originally used for electronic clocks. Links and schematiks for own experiments can be found under: &lt;ref&gt;http://www.elektronik-labor.de/Labortagebuch/Tagebuch0716.html#pendel2 Pendulum electronics for single coil &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1349">'''Game Research/Design''' ('''GR/D''') was a [[board game|board]] [[Wargaming|wargame]] publisher, principally concerned with the [[Europa (wargame)|''Europa'']] series of [[European Theatre of World War II|European World War II]] wargames.  GR/D was formed in 1985 by [[John Astell]], one of the ''Europa'' designers, and [[Winston Hamilton]], another World War II wargame designer.  The company published several Europa expansions, as well as a [[magazine]] dedicated to the series, and in 1989 GR/D acquired the rights to the series.  They published collectors' editions of the ''Europa'' games, as well as beginning two more series focusing on the [[Pacific War]] and [[World War I]].

The Europa Winter War Game was designed by Gary Stagliano, friend of John Astell.  He was partly Finnish and grew up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. He was an avid gamer and highly interested in military history.

In 2001, GR/D was purchased by Mill Creek Ventures (principal owner Carl Kleihege).  In 2004, Mill Creek sold GR/D to [[Historical Military Services]].

The '''Halifax Comedy Festival''' (often spelled in promotional materials as ''Ha!ifax Comedy Festival'') is an annual comedy festival held in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]]. The festival is sponsored by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Company|CBC]] which tapes and broadcasts the comedians' sets as a series of television specials, and is usually about one week long. Shows frequently take place at the [[Casino Nova Scotia|Halifax Casino]] in ''The Schooner Showroom'' among other venues.

Live tapings of [[CBC Radio]]'s hit show [[The Debaters]] have become a part of the annual festival, frequently using comedians who are performing in the festival as the 'debaters'.

The '''Hammond Circus Train Wreck''' occurred on June 22, 1918 during the last months of [[World War I]] and was one of the worst [[train wreck]]s in US history. Eighty-six people were reported to have died and another 127 were injured when a [[railroad engineer|locomotive engineer]] fell asleep and ran his train into the rear of another near [[Hammond, Indiana]]. The circus train held 400 performers and roustabouts of the [[Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus|Hagenbeck-Wallace]] [[circus (performing arts)|circus]]. 

==Circus train wreck==
The Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus used old wooden cars that were lit with [[Oil lamp|oil lamps]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nwitimes.com/news/history/years-ago-the-worst-circus-train-wreck-in-u-s/article_a1d86654-599a-5bb7-a1b4-db51c1c66493.html|title=100 years ago the worst circus train wreck in U.S. history happened in Gary, Indiana|last=219-548-4360|first=Doug Ross doug.ross@nwi.com,|work=nwitimes.com|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The circus train had two train segments, and the segment that was loaded with animals was dispatched prior, and had left the train with all the performers and workers on the tracks.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nwitimes.com/lifestyles/chills-without-thrills-hammond-circus-train-wreck-of-recalled-in/article_4e16609f-ee95-5431-911f-7f3ff46b987c.html|title=Chills without thrills: Hammond circus train wreck of 1918 recalled in new book|last=852-4327|first=Philip Potempa philip.potempa@nwi.com, (219)|work=nwitimes.com|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cars were being moved to a spot near Gary, Indiana, so a mechanical problem could be addressed, and some of the cars had been left on the [[Main line (railway)|main line track]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-circus-train-showmens-rest-flashback-perspec-0814-jm-20160810-story.html|title=Circus graveyard: Showmen's Rest and the Hagenbeck-Wallace tragedy of 1918|last=Grossman|first=Ron|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early morning hours of June 22, 1918, [[Alonzo Sargent]] was at the throttle of a [[Michigan Central Railroad]] troop train pulled by New York Central Class K80r [[4-6-2|4-6-2 "Pacific"]] number 8485 with 20 empty [[Sleeping car|Pullman cars]]. He was aware that his train was closely following a slower [[circus train]]. Sargent, an experienced man at the throttle, had slept little if at all in the preceding 24 hours. The effects of a lack of sleep, several heavy meals, some kidney pills, and the gentle rolling of his locomotive are thought to have caused him to fall asleep at the controls.

At approximately 4 a.m., he missed at least two automatic signals and warnings posted by a brakeman of the 26-car circus train, which had made an emergency stop to check a [[hot box]] on one of the [[flatcar]]s. The second train plowed into the [[caboose]] and four rear wooden [[sleeping car]]s of the circus train at a rail crossing known as Ivanhoe Interlocking&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite GNIS|436860|Ivanhoe}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{convert|5+1/2|mi}} east of [[Hammond, Indiana]]) at an estimated speed of {{convert|35|mph}}. Upon impact, the circus trains lamps ignited the wooden cars and quickly spread.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

Two men were stationed at the Ivanhoe [[Signalling control|Signal Tower]], about 100 feet from the accident, and phoned multiple people in an attempt to raise help for the victims. The first on the scene was the Mayor of Gary, Indiana, who brought the fire chief, and then phoned all the medical personnel he could. Triage for the victims was performed at the [[Battle Creek station (Michigan Central Railroad)|Michigan Central Railroad station]] in [[Hammond, Indiana]] and then they were sent to St. Margaret's Hospital.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Victims ==
Most of the 86 who were killed in the train wreck perished in the first 35 seconds after the collision. Then, the wreckage caught on fire. The fire was so intense that many of the victims were thought initially to be some of the African-American [[Porter (railroad)|porters]] on the train, until later investigations identified it as being severe burns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Among the dead were [[Arthur Dierckx]] and [[Max Nietzborn]] of the Great Dierckx Brothers, a strongman act&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, and [[Jennie Ward Todd]] of The Flying Wards. There were also 127 injuries.

===Showmen's Rest===

{{Main|Showmen's Rest}}
Five days later, 53 of those killed were buried in Woodlawn Cemetery,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/hammond-train-wreck-disaster-1918-killed-dozens-circus-performers-180969428/|title=The Hammond Train Wreck of 1918 Killed Scores of Circus Performers|last=Boissoneault|first=Lorraine|date=2018-06-22|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the intersection of [[Cermak Road]] and Des Plaines Avenue in [[Forest Park, Illinois]], in a section set aside as [[Showmen's Rest]], which had been purchased by the Showmen's League of America only a few months earlier. The section is surrounded by statues of [[elephant]]s in a symbolic mourning posture.

Only five of those buried were formally identified,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and so the graves of most of the casualties are marked "Unknown Male" or "Unknown Female." One grave is marked "Smiley", one "Baldy", and another "4 Horse Driver".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/2018/06/20/hagenbeck-wallace-circus-train-crash-more-horrifying-than-myths/644289002/|title=The truths of the circus train crash of 1918 are more horrifying than myths|last=Higgins|first=Will|date=2018-06-20|work=Indianapolis Star|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more recent graves at the location are those who traveled with the circus and wanted to be buried there after they died.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Investigation==

The wreck is described in great detail in the report of the joint [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] and Indiana Public Service Commission following an investigation.

Sargent, who was under arrest, refused to testify at any of the hearings on advice of his counsel. In his report of the accident to the officials of the railroad company, he made the following statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was called shortly after 8 p.m. June 21, for deadhead equipment west, engine 8485, for 10.15 p.m., and left [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]] at 10.35 p.m. Had been up since 5 a.m., June 21, dead heading from my home in [[Jackson, Michigan|Jackson]] on Train No. 41, and had had little or no sleep during the day. Had had a couple of heavy meals before going out, realizing that I would not get anything more to eat until some time the next morning. Leaving Kalamazoo, followed freight train to [[Michigan City, Indiana|Michigan City]] yard and stopped at signal near Center Street. Got proceed signal from some one on ground, pulled up to Michigan City, stopped at standpipe and took water. While following this freight train, we stopped first between [[Dowagiac, Michigan|Dowagiac]] and [[Pokagon Township, Michigan|Pokagon]] on account signal at danger. Stopped again at Pokagon and [[Niles, Michigan|Niles]] for same reason, this freight train being ahead.

&lt;br&gt;Leaving Michigan City, had clear track to [[East Gary, Indiana|East Gary]] and there caught block of train ahead, reduced speed, but did not have to stop, as block cleared before I reached it. Reduced speed going through [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]] to comply with rules, and saw no more signals at caution or danger until approaching curve east of Ivanhoe, where I found second signal east of wreck at caution. Was going about 25 miles per hour at this point, but did not reduce speed, as I expected that the next signal would probably clear before I got to it, or that I would see it, if at danger, in time to stop. The wind was blowing very hard into cab on my side and I closed the window, which made the inside of cab more comfortable. Before reaching the next signal I dozed on account of heat in cab and missed it. Not realizing what had happened to me until within 75 to 90 feet, I awoke suddenly and saw the tail or marker lights showing red on a train directly ahead of me. Not realizing that the rear end of this train was so close. I started to make a service application, but before completing it placed brake-valve handle into emergency position. We struck almost instantly after making the brake application. Don't know whether I closed the throttle or not, but think I did. Looked to see where the fireman was and saw he was running toward the gangway. Did not see a [[Flare|fusee]], hear a [[Detonator (railway)|torpedo]], or see any other warning signal up to the time I saw the red tail lights. Wreck happened at about 4.05 a.m., June 22, and I stayed there for an hour or more assisting in getting people out of the wreckage. I have been in the service of the Michigan Central Railroad Co. for approximately 28 or 29 years, the last 16 of which I have been continuously employed as an engineer. I am in perfect physical condition, as well as mental condition, and have had no illness within 25 or 30 years requiring the service of a doctor. There was nothing defective about the air brakes or other mechanism of the engine or train that I was operating, nor was there any defective condition of any of the signals or track upon which I was operating to the best of my knowledge. The accident was due solely to the fact that I accidentally fell asleep, and I had no intent to injure any person, nor was same done with malice, but solely through an accident, as aforesaid.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ICC report concluded, "This accident was caused by Engine-man Sargent being asleep, and from this cause, failing to observe the stop indication of automatic signal 2581, and the warnings of the flagman of the circus train, and to be governed by them."

The report was also critical of the older wooden cars, whose oil lamps may have ignited the fire immediately after the collision.

Although Sargent and his fireman, Gustave Klauss, were criminally charged in [[Lake County, Indiana]], following a trial the jury found itself deadlocked, and a mistrial was declared. Prosecutors declined to re-try the case, and charges were dismissed on June 9, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lUHcZ_xWmPkC&amp;q=sargent#v=snippet&amp;q=sargent&amp;f=false|title=The Great Circus Train Wreck of 1918: Tragedy on the Indiana Lakeshore|author=Richard M. Lytle|publisher=The History Press|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The train wreck was on a Saturday, and its effects caused the show in Hammond and one in [[Monroe, Wisconsin]] on June 24 to be canceled. However, the circus performed on June 25 in [[Beloit, Wisconsin]] with other circuses providing some of the acts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Haresh Sharma''' (born 1965) is a Singaporean playwright. To date, he has written more than 100 plays that have been staged all over the world, including Singapore, [[Melbourne]], Glasgow, [[Birmingham]], [[Cairo]] and London.&lt;ref name="interlogue"&gt;{{cite book | last = Klein | first = Ronald D. | authorlink = | author2 = | title = Interlogue – Studies in Singapore Literature, Volume 4: Interviews| publisher = Ethos Books | year = 2001 | location = Singapore | pages = 334–357, 384 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharma has a BA from the National University of Singapore as well as an MA in Playwriting from the University of Birmingham, obtained in 1994 on a Shell-NAC Scholarship. He has also been awarded fellowships and grants by the British Council and the United States Information Service, and was conferred the Young Artist Award in 1997. His play, ''Still Building'', was awarded a Merit [[Singapore Literature Prize]] in 1993 while ''Off Centre'' was selected by the Ministry of Education as a Literature text for 'N’ and 'O’ levels, and republished by [[The Necessary Stage]] in 2006. In 2014, Sharma was awarded the prestigious [[S.E.A. Write Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Playwright Haresh Sharma wins SEA Write Award 2014 (Singapore)|url=http://www.todayonline.com/entertainment/arts/singaporean-playwright-wins-sea-write-award-2014|accessdate=21 November 2014|agency=TODAY|publisher=MediaCorp|date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he was awarded the [[Cultural Medallion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tan|first1=Corrie|title=Four awarded Cultural Medallion|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/four-awarded-cultural-medallion|accessdate=9 November 2015|agency=The Straits Times|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.|date=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, a new volume of ''Interlogue: Studies in Singapore Literature'', was published with a focus on the works of Haresh Sharma. ''Interlogue'' is a series published by [[Ethos Books]] and edited by A/P Kirpal Singh that aims to bring critical focus on the works of Singapore writers in English. Previous editions of the series included one each on fiction, poetry, drama and interviews with local writers, as well as one dedicated volume on Singapore playwright Robert Yeo. The publication, written by Prof David Birch and edited by A/P Kirpal Singh, was an extensive investigation into Sharma's development as a writer; the themes and issues he grapples with; as well as his vision and practice of theatre within and outside his work at The Necessary Stage. While ''Interlogue'' itself was not published by [[The Necessary Stage]], the company assisted with the provision of archival material for Prof Birch's research.

In 2010, [[The Necessary Stage]] published a new anthology of Haresh's plays entitled ''Trilogy'', including the scripts and production notes of three award-winning works, ''Fundamentally Happy, Good People'' and ''Gemuk Girls''. The script of ''Those Who Can't, Teach'', which was restaged as part of the 2010 Singapore Arts Festival, was published by [[Epigram Books]]. In 2011, a collection of early short plays by Haresh Sharma entitled ''Shorts I'' was published by [[The Necessary Stage]]. In 2012, two collections of Sharma's scripts were published, one entitled ''Shorts 2'', and the other entitled ''Plays for Schools''. This was followed by the publication of a new collection of Sharma's plays on medical-related issues entitled ''Don't Forget to Remember Me'' in 2013, launched at the [[Singapore Writers Festival]]. In 2014, Sharma's play ''Best Of'' (staged four times to rave reviews in Singapore and Malaysia) and ''Eclipse'' (staged in both Singapore and Scotland) were published.

Haresh Sharma also wrote the lyrics to Singapore's National Day Parade 2011's withdrawn "Fun Pack Song", which modified the lyrics of [[Lady Gaga]]'s 'Bad Romance' to widespread criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Fun pack song" no longer part of NDP|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20110708-288133.html|accessdate=9 November 2015|agency=AsiaOne|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.|date=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, ''Fundamentally Happy'' was selected by ''[[Business Times (Singapore)|The Business Times]]'' as one of the "finest plays in 50 years" alongside productions by [[Goh Poh Seng]], [[Michael Chiang]] and [[Alfian Sa'at]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yusof|first1=Helmi|title= The finest plays in 50 years|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/the-finest-plays-in-50-years|website=The Business Times|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in Singapore, Sharma attended [[Tanjong Katong Secondary School]], [[Temasek Junior College]], as well as the [[National University of Singapore]](Nus), where he majored in English Language and Literature.&lt;ref name="interlogue" /&gt; It was also at the National University of Singapore in 1987 where he met [[Alvin Tan]], then a fellow undergraduate and founder of The Necessary Stage. He soon became involved in productions – first doing backstage, publicity, sound, and the occasional acting – then eventually moving on to scriptwriting when one of his plays won the NUS-Shell Short Play Competition in 1988.

[[Martin Luther]] used jest in many of his criticisms against the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=hub /&gt; In the introduction to [[To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation]] he calls himself a court jester, and, later in text, he explicitly invokes the jester's privilege when saying that monks should break their chastity vows.&lt;ref name=hub&gt;{{citation |title= Ethical consensus and the truth of laughter: the structure of moral transformations |volume= 4 |series= Morality and the meaning of life |author= Hub Zwart |publisher= [[Peeters Publishers]] |year= 1996 |isbn= 9789039004128 |page= 156 |url= https://books.google.es/books?id=zkQFtzp0ZwMC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kenzer &amp; Company''' (KenzerCo) is a [[Waukegan, Illinois]] based publisher of [[comic books]], [[role-playing game]]s, [[board game]]s, [[card game]]s, and [[Miniature wargaming|miniature game]]s.

They are known for the ''[[Kingdoms of Kalamar]]'' campaign setting and for their own ''[[HackMaster]]'' and ''[[Aces &amp; Eights: Shattered Frontier]]'' role-playing games (RPGs). Perhaps their best known product is the ''[[Knights of the Dinner Table]]'' (''KoDT'') magazine, which is a monthly publication that is part comic book and part RPG magazine. KenzerCo's line of comics now includes spinoffs such as ''[[Knights of the Dinner Table Illustrated]]'' and ''Spacehack'', licensed comics in the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' line, and the fantasy literature magazine ''Black Gate''. Other products include the ''[[Fairy Meat]]'' miniatures game, the ''[[Fuzzy Knights]]'' web strips, the ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' card game and board games such as ''Dwarven Dig'', ''Elemental'', and ''The Great Space Race''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyllama.com/news/1996/llama049.html Daily Llama - Kenzer &amp; Co. debut the world's first Monty Python home game!]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable employees==
* Barbara Blackburn - Assistant Editor of ''KoDT'' and staff writer
* [[Jolly R. Blackburn]] - Vice-President and creator of ''[[Knights of the Dinner Table]]''
* Brian Jelke - Vice-President and game designer
* Steve Johansson - Vice-President and game designer
* David Kenzer - President and game designer
* Jennifer Kenzer - CFO
* Mark Plemmons - Game designer, senior editor, art director, convention manager, HackMaster Association manager

==Unlicensed supplements and trademark issues==
{{importance section}}
In 1994, Kenzer &amp; Company released ''[[Kingdoms of Kalamar]]'', a [[fantasy]] [[campaign setting]] compatible with ''[[Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''.  This source book was a completely unlicensed product, and although [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] (the then-owner of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons trademark) had a precedent of threatening legal action against similar supplements, Kenzer &amp; Company was never threatened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_/TTnT_209.phtml Games &amp; The Law, Part Seven: The D&amp;D Dilemma]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the launch of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''’s [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons|3rd Edition]], Wizards of the Coast made the [[d20 System]] available under the [[Open Game License]] (OGL) and [[D20 System#Trademark license|d20 Trademark License]]. Under these licenses, authors are free to use the d20 System when writing games and game supplements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=d20/welcome| title = The d20 System| accessdate = 2007-08-14| publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after Wizards of the Coast announced the 3rd Edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, they announced jointly with Kenzer &amp; Company that Kenzer had acquired a license to produce official [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] material, using the Kalamar setting exclusively.

With the release of the fourth edition, Wizards of the Coast introduced its [[Game System License]], which represents a significant restriction compared with the very open policies embodied by the OGL. In response, Kenzer &amp; Company launched an updated version of Kingdoms of Kalamar compatible with the 4th Edition version of Dungeons &amp; Dragons which does not conform to the new GSL for approved use, instead releasing the campaign setting as an unlicensed supplement, similar to the original publication.  The Dungeons &amp; Dragons [[trademark]] is used in accordance with US law under a concept called [[Nominative use]] - the book merely says that it is for use with the new version. David Kenzer is named as an expert in copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100318021833/http://robertsongames.com/role-playing-games/dungeons-dragons/kenzer-co-dd-and-trademarks Kenzer Co, D&amp;D and Trademarks] from the Robertson Games Website

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4310">'''Los Payasos de la Tele''' ({{lang-en|The TV Clowns}}) is the name by which a trio of popular [[Spain|Spanish]] [[clown]]s are known, initially formed by '''Gaby''' ([[Gabriel Aragón]]), '''Fofó''' ([[Alfonso Aragón Bermúdez]]) and '''Miliki''' ([[Emilio Aragón Bermúdez|Emilio Aragón]]), and succeeded by '''Fofito''' (Alfonso Aragón Jr.), '''Milikito''' (Emilio Aragón Jr.) and '''Rody''' (Rody Aragón). They were well-known on Spanish language television in [[Latin America]] throughout much of the twentieth century before returning to Spain and attaining further success.

==History==
Heirs of a long family tradition of circus performance, which stretches back to the nineteenth century, they were sons of Emilio Aragón the elder and nephews of José María and Teodoro Aragón - [[Emig, Pompoff y Teddy]]. Other members of the family with circus connections included their cousins Nabucodonosorcito and Zampabollos.

Gaby, Fofó y Miliki began their activities in Spain in 1939 at the [[Circo Price]]. In 1946, the three brothers emigrated across the Atlantic, where they remained for more than a quarter of a century. They first set up shop in [[Cuba]], where they made their first incursions into the world of television in 1949. In the following years, the diffusion of their shows in other countries in [[Latin America]] made them familiar faces in [[Mexico]], [[Venezuela]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[United States]]. Between 1965 and 1971 they moved to Puerto Rico, where they transmitted a daily program called El Show de las 5, one of the most popular and remembered shows in the history of TV in that country.  

In 1970 they arrived in [[Argentina]], and achieved great success through their program ''El zapato roto'' (The broken Shoe), which they then renamed ''El show de Gaby, Fofó y Miliki''. Soon a new member of the family, ''Fofito'' (the son of Fofó), made appearances.

Two years later, in 1972, they returned to Spain, contracting with [[Televisión Española]] to front a new program called ''El Gran Circo de TVE''. It was a great success, remaining on air until 1981, and became an enormous cultural phenomenon in Spain in the 1970s. The group was awarded a [[TP de Oro]], a prestigious Spanish television award, for "most popular personality" in 1974.

After the death of Fofó in 1976, the son of Miliki, Emilio Aragón Jr., joined the group under the name ''Milikito''. He is a mute clown, in the tradition of [[Harpo Marx]], and communicates with a [[cow bell]]. Much later, after the show ended in 1981, ''Rody'', the youngest son of Fofó, joined the group in the persona of a [[black people|black]] Cuban.

Finally, the program (which in its final form was called ''El loco mundo de los payasos'', or "The Crazy World of the Clowns"), was retired from Spanish television in 1983. After several circus tours during the following two years, under the title ''El fabuloso mundo del circo'' (The Fabulous World of the Circus), the group (which by this time Miliki had already left) dissolved definitively.

In 1956 he moved to the [[US]], where worked as the President of the New York Association of VIP hairdressing. He started a career as a classical singer in 1966.  Sayan recorded his first disc with [[Renée Doria]]. As a tenor, he sang in "[[Rigoletto]]", "[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]", "[[Carmen]]" and other operas.

He has also been the impresario of [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Plácido Domingo]] and [[Mario del Monaco]], and one of Charles Aznavour's impresario (1981-2014).&lt;ref name="immedias2016.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://immedias2016.com/2016/07/charles-aznavour-fait-condamner-son-ancien-manage-levon-sayan|title=Charles Aznavour fait condamner son ancien manage, Lévon Sayan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="non-stop-people.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.non-stop-people.com/actu/musique/charles-aznavour-fait-condamner-son-ancien-manager-levon-sayan-118135|title=Charles Aznavour fait condamner son ancien manager Lévon Sayan !|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orange.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://actu.orange.fr/societe/people/charles-aznavour-fait-condamner-son-ancien-manager-magic-CNT000000rsnMQ.html|title=Charles Aznavour fait condamner son ancien manager|date=19 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 he visited Armenia for the first time. In 2008 Aznavour and Sayan were granted Armenian citizenship by the President of Armenia.

On May 23, 2003, during a special reception the president of [[Armenia]], [[Robert Kocharyan]], honored him with the [[Khorenatsi medal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.president.am/rus/?sub=news&amp;day=21&amp;month=05&amp;year=2003 President.am News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819065051/http://news.president.am/rus/?sub=news |date=2007-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he received the "Special Prize" of the Armenian National Music Award. In 2009 Armenian President [[Serzh Sargsyan]] signed a decree on awarding Lévon Sayan with the Order of Honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nt.am/en/news/23157/|title=Levon Sayan awarded Order of Honor of Armenia|website=nt.am}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sayan was condemned by Charles Aznavour for depositing the brand "Aznavour pour l'Arménie" and was fined by the French courts.&lt;ref name="immedias2016.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="non-stop-people.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="orange.fr"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The Sanskrit root word of Marga is mrg,&lt;ref&gt;http://piliosangeet.com/en/music/48-sangeet.html&lt;/ref&gt; "which indicates contemplation and seeking."
The article also mentions "That which was discovered by Brahma and (first) practiced by Bharata and others in the audience of lord Shiva is known as marga, which definitely bestows prosperity; while the sangeeta comprising gitam, vadyam and nrttam, that entertains people according to their taste in the different regions, is known as desi"

==Connection between Marga Sangeet and Samagana==
[[Samagana]] mentions 
* Gramgeyo-gān: Sung in villages or towns. 
* Aranyageya-gān: Practiced in solitude of forest. Also called Rahasyageyo-gān. 
* Ooh-gān: Pragath-s specially created for yajna on basis of Gramgeyo-gān. 
* Oohya-gān ऊह्यगान: Pragath-s created for yajna on basis of Rahasyageyo-gān.
The connection between Marga Sangeet and Rahasyageyo-gān is one of Swara-sadhana

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9304">The '''Music Library Association''' ('''MLA''') of the [[United States]] is the main professional organization for [[Music library|music libraries]] and [[Music librarianship|librarians]] (including those whose music materials form only part of their responsibilities and collections).  It also serves corporations, institutions, students, composers, scholars and others whose work and interests lie in the music librarianship field.  National meetings occur annually.

==Purpose==
"The purposes of the Association shall be to promote the establishment, growth, and use of music libraries; to encourage the collection of music and musical literature in libraries; to further studies in musical bibliography; to increase efficiency in music library service and administration; and to promote the profession of music librarianship.  The Association is a non-stock, non-profit corporation organized and operated exclusively for said purposes.  No part of the net earnings of the Association shall inure to the benefit of any individual.  No officer, member, or delegate of a member shall, as such, receive compensation except that reasonable compensation may be paid for services of employees of the Association."&lt;ref&gt;[http://musiclibraryassoc.org/about.aspx?id=57 ''Bylaws of the MLA''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319085431/http://www.musiclibraryassoc.org/about.aspx?id=57 |date=2011-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The MLA is composed of five operational elements:
* '''Administration:''' officers of the MLA, including the board of directors, special officers, editors, and business office.
* '''Committees:''' groups formed to address specific issues in the (standing) categories of development, education, finance, membership, program and publications.  Special committees are appointed by the president for administration, awards, bibliographic control, legislation, preservation, public libraries, reference and public service, and resource sharing and collection development.  There are also joint committees involved with other institutions, such music organizations and academic institutions.
* '''Representatives and Liaisons:''' to external organizations involved in library and information science and/or music.
* '''Roundtables and Interest Groups:''' composed of MLA members, assembling during annual meetings.  Roundtables allow members to discuss specific issues not covered by committees.  
* '''Regional Chapters:''' As stated on the MLA website, these chapters have two functions: "To promote cooperation among music librarians and among libraries within a given region" and "To provide a forum for discussion of library matters, some of which may be more specific or more regional in nature than those on programs at national meetings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://musiclibraryassoc.org/about.aspx?id=60 ''MLA- Regional Chapters''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319085018/http://www.musiclibraryassoc.org/about.aspx?id=60 |date=2011-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the MLA, regional chapters have listservs that they use to distribute information to members.

Regional chapters include:

* Atlantic 
* California
* Greater New York 
* Midwest 
* Mountain-Plains
* New England
* New York State- Ontario
* Pacific Northwest 
* Southeast 
* Texas

==Membership==

The MLA offers membership on a yearly basis.  Costs vary depending on the type of membership (institutional, associate, student, retired, etc.).

==Publications==

The MLA produces several different publications covering different aspects of the field.  Publications include:

* a quarterly newsletter
* a membership handbook
* ''[[Notes (journal)|Notes]]'', Quarterly Journal of the Music Library Association
* Three series:
** Basic Manual Series- "designed to assist the librarian in dealing with various aspects of the organization, administration and use of a music library."
** Index and Bibliography Series- presenting resources for music and music literature, from discographies of popular music to bibliographies of subjects in ethnomusicology. 
**Technical Reports- viewing the hands-on aspects of the field, such as cataloging issues, audio equipment, and current research topics.

==Services==

The MLA website offers a wide range of services and resources to members and non-members alike: employment and education information, awards and grants, copyright guidelines, and resources concerning the field.  These include the MLA-L (a listserv open to the public), resources generated by the MLA committees and groups, external resources via print and web, and the MLA Shop, which is the organization's official store.

== History ==
The Music Library Association was founded in June 1931 during the [[American Library Association]] meetings in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].  Its founding was spearheaded by Eva Judd O'Meara (1884–1979) and Carleton Sprague Smith (1905–1994) of the [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts|New York Public Library]].  Among their objectives was to improve cataloging for sheet music and audio recordings.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Aspects of Cataloging and Classification, Volume 1'', by Martin D. Joachim (born 1938), Hawthorn Information Press, pg. 473 (2002) {{ISBN|0-7890-1980-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Music Library Association: The Founding Generation and Its Work'', by Carol June Bradley, [[Notes (journal)|Notes]], Second Series, Vol. 37, No. 4 (June 1981), pps. 763-822&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jiu Xiao Huan Pei.jpg|thumb|300px|A famous [[Tang Dynasty]] guqin "Jiu Xiao Huan Pei". The [[guqin]] has been played since ancient times, and has traditionally been favored by scholars and literati as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement.]]

'''Music history''', sometimes called historical musicology, is the highly diverse subfield of the broader discipline of [[musicology]] that studies music from a historical viewpoint.
In theory, "music history" could refer to the study of the history of any type or genre of music (e.g., the history of [[Music of India|Indian music]] or the history of [[Rock music|rock]]). In practice, these research topics are often categorized as part of [[ethnomusicology]] or [[cultural studies]], whether or not they are [[ethnography|ethnographically based]]. The terms "music history" and "historical musicology" usually refer to the history of the notated music of Western elites, sometimes called "art music" (by analogy to art history, which tends to focus on elite art).

The methods of music history include source studies (esp. [[manuscript]] studies), [[paleography]], [[philology]] (especially [[textual criticism]]), style criticism, historiography (the choice of [[historical method]]), [[musical analysis]], and [[iconography]]. The application of musical analysis to further these goals is often a part of music history, though pure analysis or the development of new tools of music analysis is more likely to be seen in the field of [[music theory]]. Some of the intellectual products of music historians include editions of musical works, [[biographies|biography]] of composers and other musicians, studies of the relationship between [[word]]s and music, and the reflections upon the place of music in [[society]].

==Pedagogy==
Although most performers of classical and traditional instruments receive some instruction in music, art pop, or rock and roll history from teachers throughout their training, the majority of formal music history courses are offered at the [[college]] level.  In Canada, some music students receive training prior to undergraduate studies because examinations in music history (as well as music theory) are required to complete Royal Conservatory certification at the Grade 9 level and higher

Most medium and large institutions will offer both types of courses.  The two types of courses will usually differ in length (one to two semesters vs. two to four), breadth (many music appreciation courses begin at the [[Baroque music|late Baroque]] or [[Classical music era|classical]] eras and might omit music after [[World War II|WWII]] while courses for majors traditionally span the period from the [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]] to recent times), and depth. Both types of courses tend to emphasize a balance among the acquisition of musical [[repertory]] (often emphasized through listening examinations), study and analysis of these works, biographical and cultural details of music and musicians, and writing about music, perhaps through [[music criticism]].

More specialized seminars in music history tend to use a similar approach on a narrower subject while introducing more of the tools of research in music history.The range of possible topics is virtually limitless.  Some examples might be "Music during [[World War I]]," "Medieval and Renaissance [[musical instrument|instrumental]] music," "Music and Process," "[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] ''Don Giovanni''."

The methods and tools of music history are nearly as many as its subjects and therefore make a strict categorization impossible. However, a few trends and approaches can be outlined here. Like in any other historical discipline, most research in music history can be roughly divided into two categories: the establishing of factual and correct data and the interpretation of data. Most historical research does not fall into one category solely, but rather employs a combination of methods from both categories. It should also be noted that the act of establishing factual data can never be fully separate from the act of interpretation.

'''Archival work''' may be conducted to find connections to music or musicians in a collection of documents of broader interests (e.g., [[Vatican Secret Archives|Vatican]] pay records, letters to a patroness of the arts) or to more systematically study a collection of documents related to a musician.  In some cases, where records, scores, and letters have been digitized, [[Archive|archival]] work can be done online. One example of a composer for whom archival materials can be examined online is the [[Arnold Schoenberg]] Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoenberg.at/ Schoenberg.at]&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Performance practice''' draws on many of the tools of historical musicology to answer the specific question of how music was performed in various places at various times in the past. Scholars investigate questions such as which instruments or voices were used to perform a given work, what tempos (or tempo changes) were used, and how (or if) ornaments were used. Although [[performance practice]] was previously confined to early music from the Baroque era, since the 1990s, research in performance practice has examined other historical eras, such as how early Classical era piano concerti were performed, how the early history of recording affected the use of vibrato in classical music, or which instruments were used in [[Klezmer]] music.

'''Biographical studies''' of composers can give a better sense of the chronology of compositions, influences on style and works, and provide important background to the interpretation (by performers or listeners) of works.  Thus biography can form one part of the larger study of the cultural significance, underlying program, or agenda of a work; a study which gained increasing importance in the 1980s and early 1990s.

'''Sociological studies''' focus on the function of music in society as well as its meaning for individuals and society as a whole. Researchers emphasizing the social importance of music (including classical music) are sometimes called [[New musicology|New musicologists]].

'''Semiotic studies''' are most conventionally the province of music analysts rather than historians.  However, crucial to the practice of musical semiotics – the interpretation of meaning in a work or style – is its situation in a historical context.  The interpretative work of scholars such as [[Kofi Agawu]] and [[Lawrence Kramer (musicologist)|Lawrence Kramer]] fall between the analytic and the music historical.

==History==

===Before 1800===
The first studies of Western musical history date back to the middle of the 18th century. [[Giovanni Battista Martini|G.B. Martini]] published a three volume history titled ''Storia della musica'' (''History of Music'') between 1757 and 1781. [[Martin Gerbert]] published a two volume history of sacred music titled ''De cantu de musica sacra'' in 1774. Gerbert followed this work with a three volume work ''Scriptores ecclesiastici de musica sacra'' containing significant writings on sacred music from the 3rd century onwards in 1784.

===1800–1950===
[[Image:Beethoven opus 101 manuscript.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s manuscript sketch for [[Piano Sonata No. 28 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 28]], Movement IV, ''Geschwind, doch nicht zu sehr und mit Entschlossenheit'' ([[Tempo|Allegro]]), in his own handwriting. The piece was completed in 1816.]]
In the 20th century, the work of [[:de:Johannes Wolf (Musikwissenschaftler)|Johannes Wolf]] and others developed studies in [[Medieval music]] and early [[Renaissance music]]. Wolf's writings on the history of musical notation are considered to be particularly notable by musicologists. Historical musicology has played a critical role in renewed interest in [[Baroque music]] as well as medieval and Renaissance music. In particular, the [[authentic performance]] movement owes much to historical musicological scholarship. Towards the middle of the 20th century, musicology (and its largest subfield of historical musicology) expanded significantly as a field of study.  Concurrently the number of musicological and music journals increased to create further outlets for the publication of research.  The domination of German language scholarship ebbed as significant journals sprang up throughout the West, especially America.

==Critiques==

=== Exclusion of disciplines and musics ===
In its most narrow definition, historical musicology is the music history of Western culture. Such a definition arbitrarily excludes disciplines other than history, cultures other than Western, and forms of music other than "classical" ("art", "serious", "high culture") or notated ("artificial") – implying that the omitted disciplines, cultures, and musical styles/genres are somehow inferior. A somewhat broader definition incorporating all musical humanities is still problematic, because it arbitrarily excludes the relevant (natural) sciences (acoustics, psychology, physiology, neurosciences, information and computer sciences, empirical sociology and aesthetics) as well as musical practice.  The musicological sub-disciplines of [[music theory]] and music analysis have likewise historically been rather uneasily separated from the most narrow definition of historical musicology.

Within historical musicology, scholars have been reluctant to adopt postmodern and critical approaches that are common elsewhere in the humanities. According to [[Susan McClary]] (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;1285) the discipline of "music lags behind the other arts; it picks up ideas from other media just when they have become outmoded." Only in the 1990s did historical musicologists, preceded by feminist musicologists in the late 1980s, begin to address issues such as gender, sexualities, bodies, emotions, and subjectivities which dominated the humanities for twenty years before (ibid, p.&amp;nbsp;10). In McClary's words (1991, p.&amp;nbsp;5), "It almost seems that musicology managed miraculously to pass directly from pre- to postfeminism without ever having to change – or even examine – its ways." Furthermore, in their discussion on musicology and rock music, Susan McClary and Robert Walser also address a key struggle within the discipline: how musicology has often "dismisse[d] questions of socio-musical interaction out of hand, that part of classical music's greatness is ascribed to its autonomy from society." (1988,  p.&amp;nbsp;283)

=== Exclusion of popular music ===
According to [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]], the strongest criticism of (historical) musicology has been that it generally ignores popular music. Though musicological study of popular music has vastly increased in quantity recently, Middleton's assertion in 1990—that most major "works of musicology, theoretical or historical, act as though popular music did not exist"—holds true. Academic and conservatory training typically only peripherally addresses this broad spectrum of musics, and many (historical) musicologists who are "both contemptuous and condescending are looking for types of production, musical form, and listening which they associate with a ''different'' kind of music...'classical music'...and they generally find popular music lacking"

He cites three main aspects of this problem (p.&amp;nbsp;104–6). The terminology of historical musicology is "slanted by the needs and history of a particular music ('classical music')." He acknowledges that "there is a rich vocabulary for certain areas [harmony, tonality, certain part-writing and forms], important in musicology's typical corpus"; yet he points out that there is "an impoverished vocabulary for other areas [rhythm, pitch nuance and gradation, and timbre], which are less well developed" in Classical music. Middleton argues that a number of "terms are ideologically loaded" in that "they always involve selective, and often unconsciously formulated, conceptions of what music ''is''."

As well, he claims that historical musicology uses "a methodology slanted by the characteristics of notation," 'notational centricity' (Tagg 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;28–32). As a result, "musicological methods tend to foreground those musical parameters which can be easily notated" such as pitch relationships or the relationship between words and music. On the other hand, historical musicology tends to "neglect or have difficulty with parameters which are not easily notated", such as tone colour or non-Western rhythms. In addition, he claims that the "notation-centric training" of Western music schools "induces particular forms of ''listening'', and these then tend to be applied to ''all'' sorts of music, appropriately or not". As a result, Western music students trained in historical musicology may listen to a [[funk]] or [[Latin American music|Latin]] song that is very rhythmically complex, but then dismiss it as a low-level musical work because it has a very simple melody and only uses two or five chords.

Notational centricity also encourages "reification: the score comes to be seen as 'the music', or perhaps the music in an ideal form." As such, music that does not use a written score, such as jazz, blues, or folk, can become demoted to a lower level of status. As well, historical musicology has "an ideology slanted by the origins and development of a particular body of music and its aesthetic...It arose at a specific moment, in a specific context – nineteenth-century Europe, especially Germany – and in close association with that movement in the musical ''practice'' of the period which was codifying the very repertory then taken by musicology as the centre of its attention." These terminological, methodological, and ideological problems affect even works sympathetic to popular music. However, it is not "that musicology ''cannot'' understand popular music, or that students of popular music should abandon musicology."  (Middleton, p.&amp;nbsp;104).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6014">'''Narcotizing dysfunction''' is a theory that as [[mass media]] inundates people on a particular issue, they become apathetic to it, substituting knowledge for action.&lt;ref&gt;Baran ''et al.'' pp.179-80 quotation: {{quotation|one of the first media effects to be studied in some depth using functional analysis was the '''narcotizing dysfunction''', the idea that as news about an issue inundates people, they become apathetic to it... These findings were disturbing because they suggested that even when media are effective at surveying the environment and calling attention to societal problems (a manifest function), ... media coverage might "[[narcotics|narcotize]]" [the public] so that they become apathetic and decide that they are powerless to do anything (a latent dysfunction).}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that the vast supply of communications Americans receive may elicit only a superficial concern with the problems of society. This would result in real societal action being neglected, while superficiality covers up mass [[apathy]]. Thus, it is termed "[[wikt:dysfunctional|dysfunctional]]" as it indicates the inherent dysfunction of both [[mass media]] and [[social media]] during controversial incidents and events. The theory assumes that it is not in the best interests of people to form a social mass that is politically apathetic and inert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eşitti|first=Şakir |url=https://asosindex.com/cache/articles/sosyal-medyanin-uyusturan-etkisi-f187234.pdf|title=Narcotizing Effect of Social Media|date=April 2016|department=Rethinking the Contributions of Social Media to Democracy and Social Movements|journal=Cankiri Karatekin University Journal of Institute of Social Sciences|format=PDF|volume=7 |issue=1|page=1023|id=ASOS f187234|accessdate=August 7, 2018|quote=...social media can act against political participation &amp; grass roots mobilization because social media &amp; other internet based technologies "discourage face-to-face communication"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.irfanerdogan.com/dergiweb2008/24/13.pdf| title=Mass communication, popular taste, and organized social action|vauthors=Lazarsfeld PF, Merton RK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''narcotizing dysfunction'' was identified in the article ''Mass Communication, Popular Taste and Organized Social Action'', by [[Paul F.

Mass media's overwhelming flow of information has caused the populace to become passive in their social activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eşitti|first=Şakir|date=2016-04-01|title=Narcotizing Effect of Social Media|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301685342_Narcotizing_Effect_of_Social_Media|journal=Çankırı Karatekin Üniversitesi Sosyal Bilimler Enstitüsü Dergisi|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the individual is assailed with information about a huge range of issues and problems and they are knowledgeable about or able to discuss these issues, they believe they are helping to resolve these issues. As more time is spent educating oneself on current issues, there is a decrease in time available to take organized social action. Courses of action may be discussed, but they are rather internalized and rarely come to fruition. In short, people have unwittingly substituted knowledge for action.&lt;ref name="M+L-1957" /&gt; People's consciences are clear, as they think they have done something to address the issue. However, being informed and concerned is not a replacement for action. Even though there are increasing numbers of political messages, information, and advertisements available through traditional media and online media, [[political participation]] continues to decline. People pay close attention to the media, but there is an overexposure of messages that can get confusing and contradictory so people do not get involved in the political process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UKKzMtuS2EC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=gx1KP6lvC2&amp;dq=narcotizing+dysfunction&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=narcotizing+dysfunction&amp;f=false|title=MediaWriting: Print, Broadcast, and Public Relations|first1=Rik|last1=Whitaker|first2=Janet|last2=Ramsey|first3=Ronald D.|last3=Smith|date=19 December 2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|via=Google Books|isbn=9780203886700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term &lt;i&gt;narcotizing dysfunction&lt;/i&gt; gained popularity from its use in the 1948 article ''Mass Communication, Popular Taste, and Organized Social Action'', by Paul F. Lazarsfeld and Robert K. Merton. In Lazarsfeld and Merton's article, it appears as the third function of mass media's problematic social effects, alongside social status conferral function and the enforcement of social norms.

'''Pandora Pann''' is a fictional [[comic book]] character owned by [[DC Comics]]. Pandora debuted in ''[[The Comic Reader]]'' #197 (December 1981) and was created by [[Len Wein]] and [[Ross Andru]]. Pandora Pann is based on the [[Greek Mythology|Greek myth]] of [[Pandora]] the first woman, as related by the poet [[Hesiod]] in his epic poem, the ''[[Theogony]]'' (700 BCE).

==Publication history==
The character was originally slated for a September 1982 publication date by DC Comics. [[Len Wein]] and [[Ross Andru]]’s Pandora Pann was described in ''The Comic Reader'' #197 (December 1981) as "the assistant of an archaeologist who unwittingly opens [[Pandora's box]] and spends the rest of her time trying to retrieve the evil she has unleashed by doing so."

Pandora Pann was originally scheduled to debut as a [[DC Comics insert previews|backup preview]] in ''[[Swamp Thing (comic book)|The Saga of the Swamp Thing]]'' #5 (September 1982). Promotional art from the preview debuted in ''The Comic Reader'' #201 (April 1982). According to an interview in ''The Comic Reader'' #202 (May 1982) the series was instead put on indefinite hiatus “due to Len Wein's inability to find the time to write it.”  Launched instead was ''[[Arion (comics)|Arion, Lord of Atlantis]]'', which had run for several months as a backup feature in ''[[Warlord (comics)|The Warlord]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Mangels|first= Andy|authorlink = Andy Mangels|title= Opening the Box: Pandora Pann's Lost Adventures|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 46|page= 37|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= February 2011|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Bob Rozakis]] asked him about the character,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/bobro/101287898026946.htm|title= It's BobRo...The Answer Man!|first= Bob|last= Rozakis|authorlink= Bob Rozakis|date= 2001|publisher= Silver Bullet Comic Books|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20020618214714/http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/bobro/101287898026946.htm|archivedate= June 18, 2002|deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Len Wein]] responded with:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even I had forgotten about Pandora Pann. The answer is that Ross Andru penciled most of a terrific-looking 15 page insert to be included in ''Swamp Thing'', before going off into her own book. But for reasons sadly lost to history (meaning, for the life of me, I can no longer remember why), we never went ahead with the series. A shame too, since it would have preceded things like Tomb Raider and Relic Hunter by decades. And there you have another Secret Behind the Comics.
--Len Wein&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1799">A '''photographophone''' is a device that was first developed by [[Ernst Ruhmer]] of [[Berlin]], Germany in 1900. The Photographophone could record and reproduce speech and music through a [[celluloid]] film. The process started by speaking into a [[microphone]]. The electrical signal from the microphone through a [[transformer]] supplied electric current from a battery pack that caused a corresponding variation in the light of an arc (later used an [[incandescent lamp]]). The light from the arc lamp passes through the cylindrical lens slot which created sharp white lines on the moving sensitive film. This film, after being taken out of the box and developed, shows a series of perpendicular striations parallel to one another, which are really a photographic record of the sound waves originally entering the telephone transmitter. 
To reproduce the sound an projector directs light through the film traveling with the velocity equal to that with which the record is made. Behind the film a sensitive selenium cell is mounted receiving the variations in light producing a variation in its [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] and a corresponding  effect in the telephone receivers connected.

"It is truly a wonderful process: sound becomes electricity, becomes light, causes chemical action, becomes light and electricity again, and finally sound."&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b33006;view=1up;seq=57 ''Wireless Telephony In Theory and Practice''] by Ernst Ruhmer (translated from the German by James Erskine-Murray), 1908, page 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The farm's segments produce ingredients that can be used in pizza, such as [[wheat]] for the crust, [[tomato]]es or [[herb]]s, [[pork]] for [[pepperoni]], [[Dairy cattle|dairy cows]] for [[cheese]], and even trees for pizza oven [[firewood]]. Certain farms may even have access to coal or natural gas deposits that can be used as additional pizza oven heating fuels. Many of the newer pizza farms are experimenting with [[alternative energy]], such as installing [[wind turbines]] in the fields, to be more green.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Farms which cook their own pizzas, sometimes using ingredients grown on the farm itself, are also called "pizza farms" and have become popular in [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twincities.eater.com/maps/pizza-farm-minnesota-wisconsin|title=Where to Eat Pizza on a Farm|work=Eater Twin Cities|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907652945|title=Soil sisters : a tooklit for women farmers|last=Kivirist|first=Lisa|publisher=[[New Society Publishers]]|others=|year=2016|isbn=9780865718050|location=Gabriola Island, BC|pages=135|oclc=907652945|quote=With roots originating in the Midwest, the 'pizza farm' concept involves a farm serving these cheesy tomato pies, typically with farm-raised fare as ingredients ...

'''Robert Wilson''' (born October 4, 1941) is an American [[experimental theater]] [[stage director]] and [[playwright]] who has been described by the media as "[America]'s – or even the world's – foremost avant-garde 'theater artist{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/15/magazine/staging-painterly-visions.html|title=Staging Painterly Visions|author=[[John Rockwell]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1992-11-15|page=23 (sect. 6)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of his wide-ranging career, he has also worked as a [[choreographer]], [[performer]], [[Painting|painter]], [[sculptor]], [[video artist]], and [[sound]] and [[lighting designer]]. 

He is best known for his collaborations with [[Philip Glass]] on ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]'', and with numerous other artists, including [[Heiner Müller]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Tom Waits]], [[David Byrne]], [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Gavin Bryars]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], [[Marina Abramović]], [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], [[Darryl Pinckney]], [[Richard Gallo (performance artist)|Richard Gallo]], and [[Lady Gaga]]. In 1991 Wilson established [[The Watermill Center]], "a laboratory for performance" on the East End of [[Long Island]], New York. He has received more commissions for new works in Europe than in the United States since the late 20th century, regularly working with opera and theatre companies, as well as cultural festivals.

==Early life and education==
Wilson was born in [[Waco, Texas]], the son of Loree Velma (née Hamilton) and D.M. Wilson, a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/30/Robert-Wilson.html "Robert Wilson"], ''Film Reference''&lt;/ref&gt; After attending local schools, he studied business administration at the [[University of Texas]] from 1959 to 1962. 

He moved to [[Brooklyn]], New York in 1963 in order to change fields. He received a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] in architecture from the [[Pratt Institute]] in 1966. During this period, he also attended lectures by [[Sibyl Moholy-Nagy]] (widow of [[László Moholy-Nagy]]), and studied painting with artist [[George McNeil (artist)|George McNeil]]. Later he went to Arizona to study architecture with [[Paolo Soleri]] at his desert complex.&lt;ref&gt;Rima Suqi (September 21, 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/garden/robert-wilson-on-his-passion-for-chairs.html "Robert Wilson, Director, on His Passion for Chairs"], ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

=== Theater ===
After moving to New York, Wilson found himself drawn to the work of pioneering choreographers [[George Balanchine]], [[Merce Cunningham]], and [[Martha Graham]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americancenterfrance.org/front/index.php?&amp;lvlid=66&amp;dsgtypid=10&amp;a=1&amp;title=The%C3%A2tre&amp;lang=en Robert Wilson], American Center France.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, he founded an experimental performance company, the Byrd Hoffman School of Byrds (named for a teacher who helped him overcome a severe stutter while a teenager). With this company, he directed his first major works, beginning with 1969's ''The King of Spain'' and ''The Life and Times of Sigmund Freud''. He began to work in opera in the early 1970s, creating ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]'' with composer [[Philip Glass]]. This work brought the two artists worldwide renown. Following ''Einstein'', Wilson worked increasingly with major European theaters and opera houses.&lt;ref name=paula/&gt; For the New York debut of his first opera, the [[Metropolitan Opera]] allowed Wilson to rent the house on a Sunday, when they did not have a production, but would not produce the work. The house sold out in two days.&lt;ref name=rachel&gt;Rachel Donadio (January 3, 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/04/arts/international/history-time-and-space-in-opera.html "Paris Embraces ''Einstein'' Again"], ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Wilson's ''Deafman Glance'', a long, silent play, was premiered at the Nancy Festival in [[Nancy, France|France]]. It later opened in Paris, championed by the designer [[Pierre Cardin]].&lt;ref name="rachel"/&gt; The Surrealist poet [[Louis Aragon]] loved it and published a letter to the Surrealist poet [[André Breton]] (who had died in 1966),&lt;ref name="rachel"/&gt; in which he praised Wilson as: "What we, from whom Surrealism was born, dreamed would come after us and go beyond us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Design Museum |title=Robert Wilson: Theatre Director + Designer |url=http://designmuseum.org/design/robert-wilson | accessdate=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983/84, Wilson planned a performance for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], ''[[the CIVIL warS|the CIVIL warS: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down]]''; the complete work was to have been 12 hours long, in 6 parts. The production was only partially completed; the full event was cancelled by the Olympic Arts Festival, due to insufficient funds.&lt;ref name=Rockwell1990&gt;[[John Rockwell]] (June 20, 1990), [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/20/theater/critic-s-notebook-robert-wilson-wins-a-faithful-following-but-it-s-in-europe.html "Critic's Notebook; Robert Wilson Wins A Faithful Following, But It's in Europe"], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the [[Pulitzer Prize]] jury unanimously selected ''the CIVIL warS'' for the drama prize, but the supervisory board rejected the choice and gave no drama award that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= At Home With: Robert Wilson; The Clark Kent Of Modern Theater |author=Mel Gussow|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=Jan 6, 1994|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 alone, Wilson created four new productions in four different West German cities: Shakespeare's ''King Lear'' in Frankfurt, Chekhov's ''Swan Song'' in Munich, an adaptation of Virginia Woolf's ''Orlando'' in West Berlin, and ''The Black Rider,'' a collaboration by Wilson, [[Tom Waits]] and [[William S. Burroughs]], in Hamburg.&lt;ref name=Rockwell1990 /&gt;

Wilson is known for pushing the boundaries of theatre. His works are noted for their austere style, very slow movement, and often extreme scale in space or in time. ''The Life and Times of Joseph Stalin'' was a 12-hour performance, while ''KA MOUNTain and GUARDenia Terrace'' was staged on a mountaintop in [[Iran]] and lasted seven days.

In 2010 Wilson was working on a new stage musical with composer (and long-time collaborator) [[Tom Waits]] and the Irish playwright, [[Martin McDonagh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.antilabelblog.com/?p=2257 | title=New Musical From Tom Waits On The Horizon | publisher=Anti Records | date=2010-02-02 | accessdate=2010-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His theatrical production of ''Lecture on Nothing'', which was commissioned for a celebration of the [[John Cage]] centenary at the 2012 [[Ruhrtriennale]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruhrtriennale.de/en/programm/kuenstler/bob-wilson/ Robert Wilson] [[Ruhrtriennale]].&lt;/ref&gt; had its U.S. premiere in [[Royce Hall]], UCLA, by the Center for the Art of Performance.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Swed (October 16, 2013), [http://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/16/entertainment/la-et-cm-john-cage-lecture-nothing-review-20131017 "Review: Robert Wilson finds the poetry in 'Lecture on Nothing{{'"}}], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Wilson, in collaboration with [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] and co-starring [[Willem Dafoe]], developed ''[[The Old Woman (play)|The Old Woman]]'', an adaptation of the work by the Russian author [[Daniil Kharms]]. The play premiered at MIF13, Manchester International Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mif.co.uk/event/the-old-woman|title=''The Old Woman'' Robert Wilson, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Willem Dafoe|date = 2013|accessdate = 2014-11-23|website = Manchester International Festival|publisher = Manchester International Festival|last = Jansch|first = Lucie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson wrote that he and [[Mikhail Baryshnikov|Baryshnikov]] had discussed creating a play together for years, perhaps based on a Russian text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://calperformances.org/learn/program_notes/2014/pn_oldwoman.pdf|title = Cal Performances University of California, Berkeley Playbill|date = 2014|accessdate = 2014-11-23|website = Calperformances|publisher = UC Berkeley|last = Wilson|first = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final production included dance, light, singing and bilingual monologue.

Since 1999, Wilson has premiered nine theatrical works in Berlin. By contrast, as of 2013, his last commission in the United States was 21 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Barkham (August 22, 2012), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/aug/22/robert-wilson-walking-angels-norfolk "Robert Wilson takes a walk with angels in Norfolk"], ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He continues to direct revivals of his most celebrated productions, including ''The Black Rider'' in London, San Francisco, Sydney, Australia, and Los Angeles; ''The Temptation of St. Anthony'' in New York and Barcelona; ''Erwartung'' in Berlin; ''Madama Butterfly'' at the [[Bolshoi Opera]] in Moscow; and Wagner's ''Der Ring des Nibelungen'' at [[Théâtre du Châtelet]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=paula&gt;[http://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/493 "Robert Wilson, Deafman Glance": Video Installation, September 24 – November 13, 2010] [[Paula Cooper Gallery]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; He also directs all Monteverdi operas for the opera houses of [[La Scala]] in Milan and the [[Palais Garnier]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mif.co.uk/artist/robert-wilson MIF13: Robert Wilson] Manchester International Festival.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual art and design ===
In addition to his work for the stage, Wilson creates sculpture, drawings, and furniture designs. He won the Golden Lion at the 1993 [[Venice Biennale]] for a sculptural installation. Exhibited in December 1976 at the [[Paula Cooper Gallery]], Wilson's storyboards were described by one critic as "serial art, equivalent to the slow-motion tempo of [Wilson's] theatrical style. In drawing after drawing after drawing, a detail is proposed, analyzed, refined, redefined, moved through various positions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/525 Einstein on the Beach: Robert Wilson, Philip Glass, Lucinda Childs, Christopher Knowles, Andrew de Groat, September 12 – October 20, 2012] [[Paula Cooper Gallery]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Ali Hossaini]] offered Wilson a residency at the television channel [[LAB HD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ali Hossaini |title=Merging Art and Television |url=http://www.highdef.com/magazine/archive/HighDef_2007_2MarApr.pdf |format=PDF|page= 25 |accessdate=2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Wilson, with producer Esther Gordon (and among others [[Brad Pitt]], [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], [[Robert Downey, Jr.]], [[Winona Ryder]], [[Juliette Binoche]], [[Isabelle Huppert]], [[Dita von Teese]], and [[Peter Sarsgaard]]) and later with Matthew Shattuck, has produced dozens of high-definition videos known as the [[Voom Portraits]]. Collaborators on this well-received project included the composer [[Michael Galasso]], the late artist and designer Eugene Tsai, fashion designer Kevin Santos, and lighting designer Urs Schönebaum. In addition to celebrity subjects, sitters have included royalty, animals, Nobel Prize winners and hobos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2006/12/wilson200612|title= The Subject as Star|author=Bob Colacello |journal= Vanity Fair |publisher=Condé Nast |page= 318 |date=December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American pop singer [[Lady Gaga]] announced in 2013 that she would collaborate with Wilson as part of her ARTPOP project. He subsequently designed the set for her 2013 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] performance.&lt;ref name=gaga&gt;Amy Serafin (December 12, 2013), [http://www.wallpaper.com/art/robert-wilsons-macabre-video-portraits-of-lady-gaga/7011#XhR3uydTERiTAj84.99 "Robert Wilson's macabre video portraits of Lady Gaga"] (12 Dec 2013) ''[[Wallpaper (magazine)|Wallpaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson also suggested that Gaga pose for his Voom Portraits.&lt;ref name=gaga/&gt; Knowing he had an upcoming residency as guest curator at the [[Louvre]], Wilson chose themes from the museum's collection, all dealing with death. They shot the videos in a London studio over three days, Gaga standing for 14 or 15 hours at a time.&lt;ref name=gaga/&gt; Called "Living Rooms," the resulting exhibition included two video works: one inspired by [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s ''[[The Death of Marat]]'', hung in the painting galleries, and another in which Lady Gaga brings to life a painting by [[Ingres]].&lt;ref name=rachel/&gt; In the Louvre's auditorium, Wilson hosted and took part in a series of performances, conversations, film screenings, and discussions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/en/louvre-invites-robert-wilson-living-rooms The Louvre invites Robert Wilson – Living Rooms, November 11, 2013 – February 17, 2014] [[Louvre]], Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; The centerpiece of the residency is a room filled with objects from the artist's personal collection in New York, including African masks, a Shaker chair, ancient Chinese ceramics, shoes worn by [[Marlene Dietrich]] and a photo of Wilson and Glass taken in the early 1980s by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]].&lt;ref name=rachel/&gt;

In 2011, Wilson designed an art park dedicated to the Finnish designer [[Tapio Wirkkala]] (1915–1985), situated in the [[Arabianranta]] district of Helsinki. His plans for the rectangular park feature a central square divided into nine equally sized fields separated by bushes. Each field will be installed with objects related to the home. For example, one unit will consist of a small fireplace surrounded by stones that serve as seating. The park will be lit by large, lightbox-style lamps build into the ground and by smaller ones modelled on ordinary floor lamps.&lt;ref&gt;Clemens Bomsdorf (June 28, 2011), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Helsinki-to-get-new-art-park/24045 Helsinki to get new art park] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==

===Language===
Language is one of the most important elements of theatre and Robert Wilson feels at home with commanding it in many different ways. Wilson's impact on this part of theatre alone is immense. [[Arthur Holmberg]], Professor of Theatre at [[Brandeis University]], says that "In theatre, no one has dramatized the crisis of language with as much ferocious genius as Robert Wilson".&lt;ref name=ho&gt;Holmberg, Arthur (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=GAjTK98rIwkC ''The Theatre Of Robert Wilson''], Cambridge: Cambridge UP {{ISBN|978-0-52136-492-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41}} Wilson makes it evident in his work that what's and why's of language are terribly important and cannot be overlooked. [[Tom Waits]], acclaimed songwriter and collaborator with Wilson, said this about Wilson's unique relationship with words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Words for Bob are like tacks on the kitchen floor in the dark of night and you're barefoot. So Bob clears a path he can walk through words without getting hurt. Bob changes the values and shapes of words. In some sense they take on more meaning; in some cases, less.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|43}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wilson shows the importance of language through all of his works and in many varying fashions. He credits his reading of the work of [[Gertrude Stein]] and listening to recordings of her speaking with "changing [his] way of thinking forever."&lt;ref&gt;"Director's Notes" in a program for Stein's ''Four Saints in Three Acts'', quoted in Sarah Bay-Cheng (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=FFSTAgAAQBAJ ''Mama Dada: Gertrude Stein's Avant-Garde Theater''], p. 135, New York: Routledge {{ISBN|978-0-20350-302-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson directed three of Stein's works in the 1990s: ''[[Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights]]'' (1992), ''[[Four Saints in Three Acts]]'' (1996), and ''Saints and Singing'' (1998).

Wilson considers language and, down to its very ingredients, words, as a sort of "a social artifact".&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;{{rp|44}} Not only does language change with time but it changes with person, with culture. Using his experience of working with mentally handicapped children and enlisting the collaboration of [[Christopher Knowles]], a renowned autistic poet, has allowed Wilson attack language from many views. Wilson embraces this by often "juxtaposing levels of diction – Miltonic opulence and contemporary ling, crib poetry and pre-verbal screams" in an attempt to show his audience how elusive language really is and how ever-changing it can be.&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;{{rp|44}} Visually showing words is another method Wilson uses to show the beauty of language. Often his set designs, program covers, and posters are graffiti'd with words. This allows the audience to look at the "language itself" rather than "the objects and meanings it refers to.".&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;{{rp|45}}

The lack of language becomes essential to Wilson's work as well. In the same way an artist uses positive and negative space, Wilson uses noise and silence. In working on a production of ''[[King Lear]]'', Wilson inadvertently describes his necessity of silence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The way actors are trained here is wrong. All they think about is interpreting a text. They worry about how to speak words and know nothing about their bodies. You see that by the way they walk. They don't understand the weight of a gesture in space. A good actor can command an audience by moving one finger.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|49}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This emphasis on silence is fully explored in some of his works. ''[[Deafman Glance]]'' is a play without words, and his adaptation of [[Heiner Müller]]'s play ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Quartett (play)|de|3=Quartett (Heiner Müller)|lt=Quartet}}'' contained a fifteen-minute wordless prologue. Holmberg describes these works stating, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Language does many things and does them well. But we tend to shut our eyes to what language does not do well. Despite the arrogance of words – they rule traditional theatre with an iron fist – not all experience can be translated into a linguistic code.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|50}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Celebrated twentieth century playwright [[Eugène Ionesco]] said that Wilson "surpassed [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]" because "[Wilson's] silence is a silence that speaks".&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;{{rp|52}} This silence onstage may be unnerving to audience members but serves a purpose of showing how important language is by its absence. It is Wilson's means of answering his own question: "Why is it no one looks? Why is it no one knows how to look? Why does no one see anything on stage?".&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;{{rp|52}}

Another technique Wilson uses is that of what words can mean to a particular character. His piece, ''I was sitting on my patio this guy appeared I thought I was hallucinating'', features only two characters, both of whom deliver the same stream-of-consciousness monologue. In the play's first production one character was "aloof, cold, [and] precise" while the other "brought screwball comedy… warmth and color… playful[ness]".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|61}} The different emphases and deliveries brought to the monologue two different meanings; "audiences found it hard to believe they heard the same monologue twice".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|61}} Rather than tell his audience what words are supposed to mean, he opens them up for interpretation, presenting the idea that "meanings are not tethered to words like horses to hitching posts".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|61}}

===Movement===
Movement is another key element in Wilson's work. As a dancer, he sees the importance of the way an actor moves onstage and knows the weight their movement bears. When speaking of his "play without words" rendition of [[Ibsen]]'s ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]'', Wilson says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do movement before we work on the text. Later we'll put text and movement together. I do movement first to make sure it's strong enough to stand on its own two feet without words. The movement must have a rhythm and structure of its own. It must not follow the text. It can reinforce a text without illustrating it. What you hear and what you see are two different layers. When you put them together, you create another texture.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|136}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With such an emphasis on movement, Wilson even tailors his auditions around the necessity of it. In his auditions, "Wilson often does an elaborate movement sequence" and "asks the actor to repeat it".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|136}} [[Thomas Derrah]], an actor in ''[[the CIVIL warS]]'', found the audition process to be baffling: "When I went in, [Wilson] asked me to walk across the room on a count of 31, sit down on a count of 7, put my hand to my forehead on a count of 59. I was mystified by the whole process".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|137}} To further cement the importance of movement in Wilson's works, [[Seth Goldstein]], another actor in ''the CIVIL warS'', stated "every movement from the moment I walked onto the platform until I left was choreographed to the second. During the scene at table all I did was count movements. All I thought about was timing".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|137}}

When it comes time to add the text in with movement, there is still much work to be done. Wilson pays close attention to the text and still makes sure there is enough "space around a text" in order for the audience to soak it up.&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;{{rp|139}} At this point, the actors know their movements and the time in which they are executed, allowing Wilson to tack the actions onto specific pieces of text. His overall goal is to have the rhythm of the text differ from that of the movement so his audience can see them as two completely different pieces, seeing each as what it is. When in the text/movement stage, Wilson often interrupts the rehearsal, saying things like "Something is wrong. We have to check your scripts to see if you put the numbers in the right place".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|139}} He goes on to explain the importance of this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I know it's hell to separate text and movement and maintain two different rhythms. It takes time to train yourself to keep tongue and body working against each other. But things happen with the body that have nothing to do with what we say. It's more interesting if the mind and the body are in two different places, occupying different zones of reality.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|139}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These rhythms keep the mind on its toes, consciously and subconsciously taking in the meanings behind the movement and how it is matching up with the language.

Similar to Wilson's use of the lack of language in his works, he also sees the importance that a lack of movement can have. In his production of ''[[Medea]]'', Wilson arranged a scene in which the lead singer stood still during her entire song while many others moved around her. Wilson recalls that "she complained that if I didn't give her any movements, no one would notice her. I told her if she knew how to stand, everyone would watch her. I told her to stand like a marble statue of a goddess who had been standing in the same spot for a thousand years".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|147}} Allowing an actor to have such stage presence without ever saying a word is very provocative, which is precisely what Wilson means to accomplish with any sense of movement he puts on the stage.

===Lighting===
Wilson believes that, "The most important part of theatre" is light.&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;{{rp|121}} He is concerned with how images are defined onstage, and this is related to the light of an object or tableau. He feels that the lighting design can really bring the production to life. The set designer for Wilson's ''[[The Civil Wars: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down|the CIVIL warS]]'', [[Tom Kamm]], describes his philosophy: "a set for Wilson is a canvas for the light to hit like paint".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|121}} He explains, "If you know how to light, you can make shit look like gold. I paint, I build, I compose with light. Light is a magic wand".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|121}}

Wilson is "the only major director to get billing as a lighting designer" and is recognized by some as "the greatest light artist of our time".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|122}} He designs with light to be flowing rather than an off-and-on pattern, thus making his lighting "like a musical score".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|123}} Wilson's lighting designs feature "dense, palpable textures" and allow "people and objects to leap out from the background".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|123}} In his design for ''Quartett'', Wilson used four hundred light cues in a span of only ninety minutes.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|122}}

He is a perfectionist, persisting to achieve every aspect of his vision. A fifteen-minute monologue in ''Quartett'' took two days for him to light while a single hand gesture took nearly three hours.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|126}} This attention to detail expresses his conviction that, "light is the most important actor on stage".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|128}}

===Props===
Wilson's interest in design extends to the props in his productions, which he designs and sometimes participates in constructing. Whether it is furniture, a light bulb, or a giant crocodile, Wilson treats each as a work of art in its own right. He demands that a full-scale model of each prop be constructed before the final one is made, in order "to check proportion, balance, and visual relationships" on stage.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|128}} Once he has approved the model, the crew builds the prop, and Wilson is "renowned for sending them back again and again and again until they satisfy him".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|128}} He is so strict in his attention to detail that when [[Jeff Muscovin]], his tech director for ''Quartett'', suggested they use an aluminum chair with a wood skin rather than a completely wooden chair, Wilson replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No, Jeff, I want wood chairs. If we make them out of aluminum, they won't sound right when they fall over and hit the floor. They'll sound like metal, not wood. It will sound false. Just make sure you get strong wood. And no knots.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|129}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such attention to detail and perfectionism usually resulted in an expensive collection of props. "Curators regard them as sculptures",&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|129}} and the props have been sold for prices ranging from "$4,500 to $80,000".&lt;ref&gt;Gussow, Mel (1998) ''Theatre On The Edge'', New York: Applause {{ISBN|978-1-55783-311-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|113}}

In 2011, New York-based company International Flavors &amp; Fragrances created a new scent, titled Black Rider, in Wilson's honor on the occasion of the director's 70th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Russeth (July 27, 2011), [http://observer.com/2011/07/capturing-the-essence-of-director-robert-wilson/ "Capturing the Essence of Director Robert Wilson"] ''[[New York Observer]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Watermill Center==
In 1991 Wilson established [[The Watermill Center]] on the site of a former Western Union laboratory on the East End of Long Island, New York. Originally styled as "a laboratory for performance", The Watermill Center now operates year-round artist residencies, public education programs, exhibitions, and performances. The Center is situated within a 10-acre campus of gardens and designed landscape, and contains numerous works of art collected by Wilson.

[[Image:Squirrel-lift.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A squirrel being successfully lifted]]
'''Squirrel fishing''' is the sporting practice of "catching" [[squirrel]]s and attempting to lift them into the air using a nut (preferably a [[peanut]]) tied to a string or [[fishing line]], and optionally some kind of [[fishing pole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://media.www.dailyemerald.com/media/storage/paper859/news/2004/05/05/Commentary/A.Noble.Line.Reel.Squirrel.Fishing.In.As.Club.Sport-1970277.shtml?sourcedomain=www.dailyemerald.com&amp;MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com |title=Commentary: A noble line: Reel squirrel fishing in as Club sport |newspaper=Oregon Daily Emerald |date=May 5, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124153510/http://media.www.dailyemerald.com/media/storage/paper859/news/2004/05/05/Commentary/A.Noble.Line.Reel.Squirrel.Fishing.In.As.Club.Sport-1970277.shtml?sourcedomain=www.dailyemerald.com&amp;MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com |archivedate=November 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some debate over where modern squirrel fishing originated. The practice was popularized by Nicholas Middleton and Zmira Zilkha during their summers at [[Middlebury College]] Italian Language School, by Nikolas Gloy and Yasuhiro Endo at the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences at [[Harvard University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Techtv: Leo Laportes 2003 Technology Almanac|first=Leo|title=Techtv: Leo Laportes 2003 Technology Almanac|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2006|pages=34|isbn=978-0-7897-2847-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Berkeley Squirrel Fisher's Club (BSF), an official student group at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], that has been featured in the campus newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bryan |last=Ritchie |url=http://archive.dailycal.org/article.php?id=8598 |title=Nutty Goodness |newspaper=The Daily Californian |date=May 6, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2009}}, [[Ohio State University]] also had a squirrel fishing club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legal.osu.edu/media/PowePointpresentationsfromRepresentingOSU%2800059299%29.PDF |title=Representing OSU: A Conference for Legal Counsel, November 20, 2009 |accessdate=December 12, 2014 |format=pdf |page=8 }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michigan State University]] was late to join in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theblacksheeponline.com/campus-life/msus-newest-sport-squirrel-fishing |title=MSU’s Newest Sport: Squirrel Fishing |accessdate=December 11, 2017 |format=html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Squirrel fishing occurred at least as early as 1889 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88085488/1889-04-06/ed-1/seq-1/#date1=1836&amp;index=1&amp;rows=20&amp;words=fishing+Squirrel&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;state=&amp;date2=1922&amp;proxtext=squirrel+fishing&amp;y=0&amp;x=0&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1 |newspaper=The Pullman Herald|title=The Pacific Coast |date=April 6, 1889 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Terri Rogers''', born '''Ivan Southgate''' (4 May 1937 – 30 May 1999) was a [[transsexual]] [[England|English]] [[ventriloquist]] and [[Illusionist|magician]].

Rogers was born in [[Ipswich]] and was a somewhat isolated youth but determined to build a career in [[variety show|variety]]. Rogers developed a technically highly proficient ventriloquism act with her ventriloquist figure '''Shorty Harris''', first of all appearing as a supporting act in [[music hall]] in the 1950s. Like her contemporary fellow ventriloquist [[Bobbie Kimber]], she began life as a man but underwent [[gender reassignment surgery]] on the [[National Health Service]] in the early 1960s. This brought her some short-lived notoriety but did not hamper her career. Rogers won acclaim for her appearance in the 1968 review ''[[Boys Will be Girls (review)|Boys Will be Girls]]'' at the [[Theatre Royal Stratford East]] and went on to become a highly regarded performer on the UK [[cabaret]] circuit. She was the only variety act ever to appear at [[Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club]]. From 1974 onwards she was a regular, though somewhat incongruous, guest on [[TV]] on ''[[The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club]]''. She also appeared on BBC TV's long running Music Hall variety show, The Good Old Days. Her cabaret career eventually extended internationally including appearances at [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] and [[The Magic Castle]] in [[Hollywood]], and on [[United States]] TV.

Her work as a magician was always something of a sideline but she was an ingenious developer of [[magic trick]]s including illusions for [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]] and [[Paul Daniels]]. She was an expert on "[[topology]]", the art of creating illusions with shapes, and wrote three standard texts on the subject. She was particularly known for illusions with [[Borromean rings]].

Rogers died in [[London]] after a series of [[stroke]]s. She was survived by her life partner [[Val Andrews (magician)|Val Andrews]], also a magician.

==Publications==
Rogers published a number of magic effects and books, predominantly through specialist magic publisher Martin Breese. These include:
* ''The Little Book of Ventriloquism ''(c.1948)
* ''Terri Rogers' Star Gate ''(1985)
* ''Boromian Link ''(1986)
* ''Wipe Out ''(1986)
* ''Word of Mind ''(1986)
* ''Secrets (1986)''
* ''More Secrets (1988)''
* ''Top Secrets ''(1998)
In addition to these books, Rogers sold several manufactured tricks, including The Key and BlockBuster.

"'''The Bad Touch'''" is a song recorded by American [[alternative rock]] band [[Bloodhound Gang]]. It was released on May 31, 1999 as the lead single from their album ''[[Hooray for Boobies]]'', which was released a year later, in the US and UK. The song was remixed by many artists including [[God Lives Underwater]], [[KMFDM]], and [[Eiffel 65]].

==Music video==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2012}}
The song's video features the band dressed in "MonkeyRat" costumes with oversized ears, in numerous locations of [[Paris]] (including the Place de l'Estrapade, [[Avenue de Saxe]], and [[Champ de Mars]]), and the [[Eiffel Tower]] is visible in many shots. During the video, the band uses [[blowgun]]s to shoot [[tranquilizer dart]]s into the [[buttocks]] of four passing young women dressed in black with short skirts and stockings, then carrying them away. They then use a [[fishing rod]] to dangle a croissant in front of a group of French [[chef]]s, enticing them to follow. The band members dance around for a few seconds and then lure three chefs into following them. The band members swallow several [[mealworm]]s, before finding two stereotypically French [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] [[gay]] men in a [[café]], who are then beaten over the head with [[baguette]]s and knocked unconscious. A [[dwarfism|dwarf]] [[mime artist]] played by actor [[Jordan Prentice]] is captured in a [[Net (device)|net]] and then thrown into a [[Cage (enclosure)|cage]] with the four women, three chefs and the gay couple in a clear parody of animal collectors capturing frightened specimens. The band leap around the cage taunting their captives. As the song draws to an end, the prisoners are released and all dance together in formation in the street. The mime artist escapes and is run over by a speeding [[Renault 5]] car driven by [[Lüpüs Thünder]].

The uncensored version of the video shows the band playing with and eating a brown semi-liquid food, with the implication that it is [[diarrhea]], and a beginning which features them feigning sex in a [[doggy-style]] position rather than dancing as in the clean version. The violent capture of the gay couple is also missing from some versions.

===Controversy===
A scene in the video featuring a pair of gay men in sailor suits, who share [[french fries]] and are subsequently beaten by the band members wielding baguettes, was cut after it initially premiered.&lt;ref name="cmj"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sansone |first1=Glen |year=2000 |title=Bloodhound Gang Edits Objectionable Video |journal=CMJ New Music Report |volume=61 |issue=658 |page=4 |publisher=[[CMJ Network]] |ISSN=0890-0795 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVSvnTBzZGsC |accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GLAAD]] complained about the scene to [[MTV]] stating that "a gay-bashing scene in any context in today's climate is not acceptable".&lt;ref name="cmj" /&gt; MTV reviewed the video and suggested to [[Geffen Records]] that the scene be cut.&lt;ref name="cmj" /&gt; On the scene, lead singer [[Jimmy Pop]] commented "I would give any gay man two tickets to the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] musical of his choice if he could describe exactly who's going to become violent based on that scene".&lt;ref name="spin-expert"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kenneally |first1=Tim |year=2000 |title=Ask the Experts |journal=Spin |volume=16 |issue=6 |page=52 |publisher=[[SPIN Media LLC]] |ISSN=0886-3032 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6N0JSkTI3j4C |accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Three Princes of Serendip''''' is the English version of the story ''[https://it.wikisource.org/wiki/Peregrinaggio_di_tre_giovani_figliuoli_del_re_di_Serendippo Peregrinaggio di tre giovani figliuoli del re di Serendippo]'' published by Michele Tramezzino in Venice in 1557. Tramezzino claimed to have heard the story from one [[:it:Cristoforo Armeno|Cristoforo Armeno]], who had translated the [[Persian language|Persian]] [[fairy tale]] into Italian, adapting Book One of [[Amir Khusro|Amir Khusrau]]'s ''[[Hasht-Bihisht (poem)|Hasht-Bihisht]]''&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book | last = Ben-Amos | first = Dan | title = Folktales of the Jews: Tales from Eastern Europe | publisher = Jewish Publication Society | page = 318 | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-8276-0830-6|display-authors=etal}}, accessible [https://books.google.com/books?id=vW-9E_fFSOUC&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=Hasht+Bihisht+written+by+Amir+Khusrau&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AJJRu55iPu&amp;sig=AQxaOi_FCBguAcaksSqO-POKZ34&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XaemSaz2EdSyjAf95uziDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result#PPA318,M1|here]&lt;/ref&gt; of 1302. The story first came to English via a French translation, and now exists in several out-of-print translations.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Remer, T. G., Ed.

The story has become known in the English-speaking world as the source of the word [[serendipity]], coined by [[Horace Walpole]] because of his recollection of the part of the "silly fairy tale" in which the three princes by "accidents and sagacity" discern the nature of a lost camel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Yallop | first = C | authorlink = Macquarie Dictionary | title = Macquarie Dictionary, Fourth Edition | publisher = The Macquarie Library pty Ltd | year = 2005 | location = Sydney, NSW, Australia | url = | isbn = 1876429143 | page = 1290 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate line of descent, the story was used by [[Voltaire]] in his 1747 ''[[Zadig]]'', and through this contributed to both the evolution of [[detective fiction]] and the self-understanding of [[scientific method]].

==The story==
"In ancient times there existed in the country of Serendippo, in the Far East, a great and powerful king by the name of Giaffer. He had three sons who were very dear to him. And being a good father and very concerned about their education, he decided that he had to leave them endowed not only with great power, but also with all kinds of virtues of which princes are particularly in need."

The father searches out the best possible tutors. "And to them he entrusted the training of his sons, with the understanding that the best they could do for him was to teach them in such a way that they could be immediately recognized as his very own."

When the tutors are pleased with the excellent progress that the three princes make in the arts and sciences, they report it to the king. He, however, still doubts their training, and summoning each in turn, declares that he will retire to the contemplative life leaving them as king. Each politely declines, affirming the father's superior wisdom and fitness to rule.

The king is pleased, but fearing that his sons' education may have been too sheltered and privileged, feigns anger at them for refusing the throne and sends them away from the land.

===The lost camel===
No sooner do the three princes arrive abroad than they trace clues to identify precisely a camel they have never seen. They conclude that the camel is lame, blind in one eye, missing a tooth, carrying a pregnant woman, and bearing honey on one side and butter on the other. When they later encounter the merchant who has lost the camel, they report their observations to him. He accuses them of stealing the camel and takes them to the [[Bahram V|Emperor Beramo]], where he demands punishment.

Beramo then asks how they are able to give such an accurate description of the camel if they have never seen it. It is clear from the princes' replies that they have used small clues to infer cleverly the nature of the camel.

Grass had been eaten from the side of the road where it was less green, so the princes had inferred that the camel was blind on the other side. Because there were lumps of chewed grass on the road that were the size of a camel’s tooth, they inferred they had fallen through the gap left by a missing tooth. The tracks showed the prints of only three feet, the fourth being dragged, indicating that the animal was lame. That butter was carried on one side of the camel and honey on the other was evident because ants had been attracted to melted butter on one side of the road and flies to spilled honey on the other.

As for the woman, one of the princes said: "I guessed that the camel must have carried a woman, because I had noticed that near the tracks where the animal had knelt down the imprint of a foot was visible. Because some urine was nearby, I wet my fingers and as a reaction to its odour I felt a sort of carnal [[concupiscence]], which convinced me that the imprint was of a woman’s foot."

"I guessed that the same woman must have been pregnant," said another prince, "because I had noticed nearby handprints which were indicative that the woman, being pregnant, had helped herself up with her hands while urinating."

At this moment, a traveller enters the scene to say that he has just found a missing camel wandering in the desert. Beramo spares the lives of the three princes, lavishes rich rewards on them, and appoints them to be his advisors.

===The story continues===
The three princes have many other adventures, where they continue to display their sagacity, stories-within-stories are told, and, of course, there is a happy ending.&lt;ref&gt;For a little more detail see Richard Boyle's retelling of the tale here [http://livingheritage.org/three_princes-2.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The fairy tale ''The Three Princes of Serendip'' is based upon the life of Persian King [[Bahram V]], who ruled the [[Sassanid Empire]] (420–440). Stories of his rule are told in epic poetry of the region ([[Firdausi]]'s ''[[Shahnameh]]'' of 1010, [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]]'s ''[[The Seven Beauties (poem)|Haft Paykar]]'' of 1197, [[Amir Khusro|Khusrau]]'s [[Hasht-Bihisht (poem)|Hasht Bihisht]] of 1302), parts of which are based upon historical facts with embellishments derived from folklore going back hundreds of years to oral traditions in India and ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]''. With the exception of the well-known camel story,&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, The Lost Camel in [[Idries Shah]]'s collection ''[[World Tales]]''. The author mentions that an ancient saying, "Faith is the lost camel of the Believer", has been said to allude to this tale. The same story is found in ''Tales of the Sun Or Folklore of Southern India'' by Mrs Howard Kingscote (Georgiana Kingscote) and Pandit Natêśa Sástrî, accessible here [https://books.google.com/books?id=dRiG80JN13EC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;dq=%22lost+camel%22+king+alakesa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AI6sNgOJV-&amp;sig=wQAi3I12qsmuH96ic6cqteK131M&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hCSlSezlBdSyjAe7xKzCBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA140,M1].&lt;/ref&gt; English translations are very hard to come by.

===Talmudic version===
A version of the fable of a camel blind in one eye is included in the [[Talmud]], attributed to [[Rabbi Yochanan]]. While it might be seen as implying that gentiles, in comparison to Jews, are rude and defecate on the road, it is worth noting that Jewish law has strong injunctions of modesty and cleanliness, including strict injunctions against open or public urination or defecation.

{{quote|
Rava relates the following in the name of Rabbi Yochanan:—“Two Jewish slaves were one day walking along, when their master, who was following, overheard the one saying to the other, ‘There is a camel ahead of us, as I judge—for I have not seen—that is blind of one eye and laden with two skin-bottles, one of which contains wine and the other oil, while two drivers attend it, one of them an Israelite, and the other a Gentile.’ ‘You perverse men,’ said their master, ‘how can you fabricate such a story as that?’ The slave answered, and gave this as his reason, ‘The grass is cropped only on one side of the track, the wine, that must have dripped, has soaked into the earth on the right, and the oil has trickled down, and may be seen on the left; while one of the drivers turned aside from the track to ease himself, but the other has not even left the road for the purpose.’ Upon this the master stepped on before them in order to verify the correctness of their inferences, and found the conclusion true in every particular. He then turned back, and ... after complimenting the two slaves for their shrewdness, he at once gave them their liberty.”
|Sanhedrin, fol. 104, col. 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/hl/hl05.htm Hebraic Literature: Translations from the Talmud, Midrashim, and Kabbala], chapter II. A similar version is contained in the 5th-century CE [[Midrash]] collection ''[[Lamentations Rabbah]]'', perhaps the oldest written version that we have.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Zadig===
[[File:VoltaireZadig.jpg|thumb|Title page of [[Voltaire]]'s [[Zadig]]]]
In chapter three of [[Voltaire]]'s 1747 novel [[Zadig]], there is an adaptation of ''The Three Princes of Serendip'', this time involving, instead of a camel, a horse and a dog, which the eponymous Zadig is able to describe in great detail from his observations of the tracks on the ground. When he is accused of theft and taken before the judges, Zadig clears himself by recounting the mental process which allows him to describe the two animals he has never seen: "I saw on the sand the tracks of an animal, and I easily judged that they were those of a little dog. Long, shallow furrows imprinted on little rises in the sand between the tracks of the paws informed me that it was a bitch whose dugs were hanging down, and that therefore she had had puppies a few days before."

Zadig's detective work was influential.&lt;ref name=Ginzburg&gt;{{cite book|last=John|first=Carlo Ginzburg; translated by|authorlink =Carlo Ginzburg|title=Clues, myths, and the historical method|year=1992|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=978-0-8018-4388-4|page=116|edition=Johns Hopkins pbk.|author2=Tedeschi, Anne C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]] wrote, in 1834, in the context of the new science of paleontology:
{{quote|"Today, anyone who sees only the print of a cloven hoof might conclude that the animal that had left it behind was a ruminator, and this conclusion is as certain as any in physics and in ethics. This footprint alone, then, provides the observer with information about the teeth, the jawbone, the vertebrae, each leg bone, the thighs, shoulders and pelvis of the animal which had just passed: it is a more certain proof than all Zadig's tracks."&lt;ref name=Ginzburg /&gt;}}
[[T. H. Huxley]], the proponent of Darwin’s theories of evolution, also found Zadig's approach instructive, and wrote in his 1880 article "The method of Zadig":
{{quote|"What, in fact, lay at the foundation of all Zadig’s arguments, but the coarse, commonplace assumption, upon which every act of our daily lives is based, that we may conclude from an effect to the pre-existence of a cause competent to produce that effect?"&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Popular Science Monthly/Volume 17/August 1880/On the Method of Zadig|On the Method of Zadig in Wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Edgar Allan Poe]] in his turn was probably inspired by Zadig&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kewer|first=Edgar Allan Poe; edited by Thomas Ollive Mabbott with the assistance of Eleanor D.|title=1831 - 1842.|year=2000|publisher=Univ. of Illinois Press|location=Urbana [u.a.]|isbn=978-0252069222|page=521|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g33tFaUbpIMC&amp;lpg=PA522&amp;dq=poe%20had%20read%20voltaire's%20zadig&amp;pg=PA521#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=1st Illinois paperback.|author2=Mabbott, Maureen C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Panek|first=Leroy Lad|title=An introduction to the detective story|year=1987|publisher=Bowling Green state university popular press|location=Bowling Green Ohio|isbn=978-0879723781|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xstGp7cOObMC&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=The%20Murders%20in%20the%20Rue%20Morgue%20source%20voltaire&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  when he created [[C. Auguste Dupin]] in "[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]", calling it a "tale of ratiocination" wherein "the extent of information obtained lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation."
Poe's M. Dupin stories mark the start of the modern [[detective fiction]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverman|first=Kenneth|title=Edgar A. Poe: mournful and never-ending remembrance|year=1992|publisher=HarperPerennial|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-06-092331-0|page=171|edition=1st Harper Perennial}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Gaboriau]], and [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] were perhaps also influenced by Zadig.&lt;ref name=Ginzburg /&gt;

'''The Trevor Project''' is an American [[nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] founded in 1998 focused on [[suicide prevention]] efforts among [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]], and [[questioning (sexuality)|questioning]] ([[LGBTQ]]) youth. Through a [[toll-free telephone number]], it operates The Trevor Lifeline, a confidential service that offers trained counselors. The stated goals of the project are to provide crisis intervention and suicide prevention services for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) young people ages 13–24, as well as to offer guidance and resources to parents and educators in order to foster safe, accepting, and inclusive environments for all youth, at home and at school.

==History==
[[File:Senator Al Franken - We Will Make It Better.ogv|thumb|left| Former senator [[Al Franken]] discussing LGBT suicide and the Trevor Project.]]
The project was founded in 1998&lt;ref name= corp/&gt; in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], [[California]], by [[James Lecesne]], Peggy Rajski, and [[Randy Stone]]. They are the creators of the 1994 [[Academy Award]]-winning [[short film]] ''[[Trevor (film)|Trevor]]'', a [[dramedy]] about Trevor, a gay thirteen-year-old boy who, when rejected by friends because of his sexuality, makes an attempt to [[suicide|take his life]]. When the film was scheduled to air on [[HBO]] television in 1998, the filmmakers realized that some of the program's young viewers might be facing the same kind of crisis as Trevor, and began to search for a support line to be broadcast during the airing. They discovered that no such helpline existed, and decided to dedicate themselves to forming what was, in their view, a much-needed resource: an organization to promote acceptance of LGBTQ youth, and to aid in crisis and suicide prevention among that group.

The Trevor Lifeline was established with seed funds provided by The Colin Higgins Foundation and HBO's license fee. As a result, it became the first nationwide, around-the-clock crisis and suicide prevention helpline for LGBTQ youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher =[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] (via [[Google Books]]) |author = Staff | date=October 13, 1998 |title=Trevor Lends a 24-Hour Ear to Youth |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cWMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;ots=6ROkFPBoia&amp;dq=Trevor%20lends%20a%2024-hour%20ear%20to%20youth&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=14|accessdate=August 1, 2011

In November 2009, the project was contracted by the Tulare County Suicide Prevention Task Force, located in [[Tulare County, California|Tulare County]], California.&lt;ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2011}} Staff (undated).  {{cite web |url=http://www.sptf.org |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101131909/http://www.sptf.org/ |archivedate=2011-01-01 |df= }}.   Tulare County Suicide Prevention Task Force.  Retrieved August 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; With this agreement, the project received public funds for the first time. In June 2009, seven Tulare County volunteers completed The Trevor Project Lifeguard Workshop Facilitator training.

===The Trevor Lifeline===
[[File:Visting the Trevor Project (5857632878).jpg|thumb|right|[[Nancy Pelosi]] visiting the Trevor Project's San Francisco ''[[Harvey Milk]] Call Center'' in 2011]]
The Trevor Lifeline is the only nationwide, around-the-clock crisis and suicide prevention helpline for LGBTQ youth in the United States. The lifeline is a free and confidential service from trained counselors trained to listen without judging, and can refer callers to supportive local organizations and groups; this information is also available on the project's website.

On August 10, 2009, the project announced that it received a major cash donation to support the lifeline from actor [[Daniel Radcliffe]], star of the ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' [[film series]]. Radcliffe said in a statement:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2009/08/10/Daniel_Radcliffe_Makes_Major_Donation_to_Trevor/ "Daniel Radcliffe Gives Big to Trevor Project"]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.  ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]], 2009-08-10''.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I am very pleased to begin my support of the Trevor Project, which saves lives every day through its critical work. It's extremely distressing to consider that in 2009 suicide is a top-three killer of young people, and it's truly devastating to learn that LGBTQ youth are up to four times more likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual peers.}}

===Ask Trevor===
"Ask Trevor" is an online non-time-sensitive question-and-answer resource for young people with questions surrounding sexual orientation and gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetrevorproject.org/asktrevor/ |title=Ask Trevor, The Trevor Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TrevorSpace is carefully monitored by administrators designated by the project to ensure all content is age-appropriate, youth-friendly and factual. Members over the age of 18 cannot privately message members under the age of 18. TrevorSpace links members to The Trevor Project's home page, where information about The Trevor Lifeline, "Dear Trevor," and other resources is available. The software used to create TrevorSpace was donated to the project by [[Tim Gill]], an American software entrepreneur and [[philanthropy|philanthropist]].

===Palette Fund Internship Program===
Through the Palette Fund Internship Program, the project provides for five internships in both its [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]] offices. Interns are placed among the program, communication, and development departments. The program provides an opportunity for young people to learn about working in the non-profit sector.  Palette Fund internships are specifically designed to introduce young leaders to the LGBTQ movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2011}} {{cite web |url=http://www.thetrevorproject.org/about-trevor/trevor-programs |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101004155407/http://www.thetrevorproject.org/about-trevor/trevor-programs |archivedate=2010-10-04 |df= }}.

===Youth Advisory Council===
The Youth Advisory Council serves as a liaison between youth nationwide and the project on issues surrounding suicide, sexuality and gender identity. The council submits recommendations to the project in an effort to increase project visibility and best serve the LGBTQ youth population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetrevorproject.org/YAC "The Trevor Project, Youth Advisory Council"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729165044/http://www.thetrevorproject.org/YAC |date=July 29, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===School workshops===
The project's Lifeguard Workshop Program uses a structured, age-appropriate curriculum to address topics around sexuality, gender identity, the impacts of language and behavior, and what it means for young people to feel different. The program also teaches young people to recognize depression and suicide amongst their peers, the impacts of language and behavior on LGBTQ youth, and suicide prevention skills in schools.&lt;ref&gt;Hurley, Morgan M.

===Tyler Oakley's fundraiser===
On February 10, 2014, [[YouTube]] personality [[Tyler Oakley]] started a fundraiser to collect $150,000 for the Trevor Project. Oakley set the deadline for the money to be collected by the time of his birthday, March 22, but the goal was reached after only six days.&lt;ref name="prizeo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prizeo.com/prizes/tyler-oakley/an-LA-date?|title=Win An LA Date with Tyler Oakley|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oakley later extended the fundraiser and more than $462,000 had been raised as of March 29. On March 31, the fundraiser ended, with a total of $525,754 raised.&lt;ref name="prizeo.com" /&gt;

==Awards==

==Home production==
===Origins===
German production of popular video-games began principally on the [[16-bit]] systems such as the [[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[Amiga]] and [[Atari]] [[Atari ST|ST]] in the 1980s, although a number of successful titles were also released on the [[Commodore 64]] which dominated the [[8-bit]] computer market in the country at the time. One of the earliest internationally successful companies was [[Gütersloh]]-based [[Rainbow Arts]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} (founded in 1984) who were, among others, responsible for publishing the popular ''[[Turrican]]'' series of games. Other popular developers of the 16-bit era included [[Thalion Software|Thalion]], [[Factor 5]] (who were responsible for developing the entire ''Turrican'' series) and [[Blue Byte]]. Blue Byte and Factor 5 remain in existence in 2006 and produce titles for systems such as Windows PCs and [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation]].

===Modern day===
By 2002, German games were heavily tilted toward [[construction and management simulation]]s, according ''[[Der Spiegel]]''{{'}}s Frank Patalong. He noted that "nowhere else in the world are simulations as successful as here at home. Titles such as ''[[The Settlers]]'', ''[[Alien Nations|Die Völker]]'' or ''[[Anno 1602]]'' have dominated the German sales charts for years".&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=http://archive.is/brlik | url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/anno-1503-wuselige-zeitreise-a-220745.html | title=Wuselige Zeitreise | date=January 11, 2002| author=Patalong, Frank | work=[[Der Spiegel]] | archivedate=November 30, 2018 | deadurl=no | language=[[German language|German]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Released in 1998, ''Anno 1602'' by [[Sunflowers Interactive]] was Germany's best-selling computer game of all time as of December 2002, with sales of 2.5 million copies worldwide and 1.7 million in the German market.&lt;ref name=n-tv&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130162131/https://www.n-tv.de/technik/Platin-fuer-Anno-1503-article116682.html | url=https://www.n-tv.de/technik/Platin-fuer-Anno-1503-article116682.html | title=Platin für "''Anno 1503''" | date=December 26, 2002 | author=Staff | work=[[n-tv]] | language=[[German language|German]] | archivedate=November 30, 2018 | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its sequel, ''[[Anno 1503]]'', broke several of its sales records, becoming Germany's fastest-selling game and fastest full-price computer game to reach 500,000 domestic sales.&lt;ref name=eurogamer&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007231711/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/article_47003 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/article_47003 |title=''Anno 1503'' fastest seller in Germany | author=Bramwell, Tom | date=November 18, 2002 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |archivedate=October 7, 2017 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sonderpreis&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130014809/http://beta.gamesmarkt.de/details/147592 | url=http://beta.gamesmarkt.de/details/147592 | title="''Anno 1503''" schlägt "''Anno 1602''" | author=Steininger, Stefan | date=January 21, 2004 | work=GamesMarkt | archivedate=November 30, 2018 | language=[[German language|German]] | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It ultimately sold over one million units in German-speaking countries,&lt;ref name=1m&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181201000249/http://beta.gamesmarkt.de/details/418357 | url=http://beta.gamesmarkt.de/details/418357 | title="''FIFA 17''" verkauft eine Millionen Units auf PS4 in Deutschland | author=Staff | date=May 15, 2017 | work=GamesMarkt | archivedate=December 1, 2018 | language=[[German language|German]] | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, when combined with its predecesor, reached 4.5 million sales worldwide by October 2006.&lt;ref name=4m&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101213836/https://www.n-tv.de/technik/Teuerstes-Spiel-aus-Deutschland-article337536.html | url=https://www.n-tv.de/technik/Teuerstes-Spiel-aus-Deutschland-article337536.html | title=Teuerstes Spiel aus Deutschland | author=Staff | date=October 23, 2006 | archivedate=January 1, 2010 | work=[[n-tv]] | language=[[German language|German]] | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The titles began the ''[[Anno (series)|Anno]]'' series.

One of the most famed titles to come out of Germany in recent years is ''[[Far Cry]]'' by [[Frankfurt]]-based [[Crytek]], who also produced ''[[Crysis]]''. Factor 5 had been concentrating on the ''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron]]'' series of gaming from 1999 until 2003, and released ''[[Lair (video game)|Lair]]'', an action game for the [[PlayStation 3]], in 2007.

Ascaron produced the ''[[Elite (video game)|Elite]]'' homage ''[[Darkstar One]]'' and continued to produce the popular ''[[Anstoss]]'' (lit. "Kick off") football series of games, the first two installations of which were released under the title ''On the Ball'' in English-speaking countries.

===Consumption===
Within Germany there is a popular taste for historical trade simulations that exceeds that of many other countries, including home-grown ones such as ''[[1602 A.D.]]'' and its sequels and ''[[The Patrician (video game)]]''.

[[Vehicle simulator]] games are also very popular in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/features/report/6226/call-that-escapism/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[First-person shooter]]s have also been traditionally quite popular in recent years, which has become a controversial debate{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. There has been much discussion about the [[Video game controversy|violent content]] of first-person shooter games, and as such these games, especially uncut versions, are highly coveted in gaming circles.

==Trade fairs==
[[File:Games Convention 2006 Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Games Convention]] 2006 in [[Leipzig]], Germany]]

From 2002 to 2008 the main video gaming trade fair in Germany was the [[Games Convention]] which was held annually in [[Leipzig]], and was highly recognized by the press. Since 2009 it was discontinued, as the [[Gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] took the place of the major gaming trade fair in the world.

==The USK and censorship==
Violence in video games is a controversial subject in Germany, and German localisations of violent games are often heavily cut by the publishers to permit a public release. Usually this entails a simple removal or reduction of depictions of blood and gore, but often extends to cuts in the content or plot of the game, as was the case in games such as ''[[Phantasmagoria (video game)|Phantasmagoria]]'', ''[[Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh]]'', ''[[Counter-Strike]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'', [[Wolfenstein: The New Order]] or ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.

All games that are released to the public are required to carry a certificate given by the USK ([[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle]] - Voluntary Monitoring Organisation of Entertainment Software). If the USK refuses certification of a title, it may be, and often is, placed upon the [[Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien|index]] of media harmful to youth kept by an offshoot of the Federal Ministry of Family Affairs. The compulsory nature of the USK label was a consequence of the 2003 modification of the ''Jugendschutzgesetz,'' or youth protection laws.

The 2003 changes to the ''Jugendschutzgesetz'' also announced an intent to extend the restrictions on the depiction of violence in video gaming, leaving open the possibility of banning any depiction of violence in video gaming, which was met by widespread outcry from the video gaming community in Germany. The then in power [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]/[[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] coalition government announced an intention to enact this in 2005, but in November 2006 it was announced that such restrictions would not be enacted at this time.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
