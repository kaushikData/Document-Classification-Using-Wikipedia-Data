      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4332">The '''AN/MRN-1''' was an instrument approach [[localizer]] used by the [[Army Air Force]] during and after [[World War II]]. It was standardized on 3 July 1942. It replaced the SCR-241, and was a component of SCS-51.

==Use==
The transmitter provides a signal to guide the '''RC-103''' equipped aircraft to the centerline of a runway. The set radiates two intersecting field patterns, one of which is modulated at an audio frequency of 90 cycles per second, and the other at an audio frequency of 150 cycles per second. the shape of the radiated patterns is such that they intersect in a vertical plane called the "course", which can be oriented (by positioning the truck) to intersect the ground in a line which coincides with the centerline of a landing runway. The range of the equipment is a function of the elevation of the receiving antenna: approximately 40 miles at an elevation of 2,500 feet, 70 miles at 6,000 feet, and 100 miles at 10,000 feet. The transmitter, '''BC-751-A''' has a frequency range from 108.3 to 110.3 Mc. power output is 25 Watts.
*'''AN/CRN-3''' is the same equipment except without the K-53 truck, thereby making it air transportable, components are housed in a tent.
[[File:ILS localizer illustration.svg|thumb|right|300px|The emission patterns of the localizer and glideslope signals. Note that the glideslope beams are partly formed by the reflection of the glideslope aerial in the ground plane.]]

== Components ==
The AN/MRN-1 is mounted in a [[K-53 truck]] and is made up of the following components.
* BC-915 control box
* BC-751 radio transmitter
* BC-752 [[Modulator]] and bridge
* BC-753 course detector fixed
* BC-754 course detector portable
* BC-755 field intensity meter
* BC-777 indicator (alarm)
* RC-109 antenna (5 [[alford loops]] in a horizontal plane)
* An [[SCR-610]] is provided for ground communications
* power is provided by a PE-141 [[Electrical generator|generator]] (115 volts)

==Aircraft components==
The '''RC-103-A''' is an airborne localizer receiver used to indicate a landing course in conjunction with the AAF instrument approach system. signals received from a transmitter, located at one end of the runway to be used, are fed into the cross-pointer indicator to indicate "on course", "fly right" or "fly left". Audio indication is also provided.
:Antenna system AS-27/ARN-5 is used with the dual installation of the localizer and glide path receivers. Antenna AN-100 is used when only the localizer receiver is installed in the aircraft.
* RC-103 components include
* Indicator I-101-C
* BC-732 control box
* BC-733 Receiver W/ DM-53 [[Dynamotor]]
* AN-100 Antenna (localizer only)
* AS-27/ARN-5 Antenna system (combination)

==Life and career==
Kotei was born on 24 May 1915, at La, near [[Accra]], and belonged to the Ga tribe and trained as a surveyor. He was a distinguished artist and designed the National Coat of Arms on 4 March 1957. He was commissioned to do the design by Ghana's first President Osagyefo Dr. [[Kwame Nkrumah]] and the then British Colonial administration as independence drew near in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=kwajo |url=http://www.ghanatoghana.com/Ghanahomepage/ghanas-coat-arms-designer-amon-kotei-dead |title=Ghana's Coat of Arms designer Amon Kotei dead |publisher=Ghanatoghana.com |date=19 October 2011 |accessdate=20 September 2012 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;   
The Ghana Coat of Arms, found on all government official letter heads, is composed of a shield, divided into four quarters by a green St. George’s Cross, rimmed with gold.

He died on 17 October 2011, after which the parliament of Ghana paid tribute to him.,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/367331/1/parliament-pays-tribute-to-amon-kotei.html |title=Parliament pays tribute to Amon Kotei |publisher=ModernGhana.com |date=16 December 2011 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghana.gov.gh/index.php/news/general-news/9761-parliament-pays-tribute-to-amon-kotei |title=Parliament Pays Tribute To Amon Kotei |publisher=Ghana.gov.gh |date=14 December 2011 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
He studied under a scholarship at [[Achimota School]] and later received a scholarship to study art at the [[London College of Communication|London School of Printing and Graphic Art]] from 1949 to 1952. He also fought for the [[Royal West African Frontier Force]] during [[World War II]]. and also worked in the Cartographic Division of the Army. He drew maps and plans for use by soldiers on the war front.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.africa-works.com/joseph/2011/10/20/rest-in-peace-amon-kotei/ {{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also taught in [[Achimota School]].

He was awarded the State Honour of Grand Medal, Civil Division, Coat of Arms Design presented to him on Friday, 7 March 1997, by then [[president]] [[Jerry John Rawlings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ghana |first=Go |url=http://newswatchmedia.blogspot.com/2010/12/man-behind-coat-of-arms-honored.html |title=newswatch blog: 95 years Amon Kotei Honoured |publisher=Newswatchmedia.blogspot.com |date=19 December 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received several other awards.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newtimes.com.gh/story/veep-parliament-eulogise-amon-kotey |title=Veep, Parliament Eulogise Amon Kotey &amp;#124; The Ghanaian Times |publisher=Newtimes.com.gh |date= |accessdate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031035808/http://newtimes.com.gh/story/veep-parliament-eulogise-amon-kotey |archivedate=31 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghanaculture.gov.gh/index1.php?linkid=65&amp;archiveid=970&amp;page=1&amp;adate=5%20March%202007 |title=National Commission On Culture |publisher=Ghanaculture.gov.gh |date= |accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cienfuegos Bay''' ({{lang-es|Bahia de Cienfuegos}}) is a bay in the [[Caribbean Sea]] located in [[Cienfuegos Province]] on the southern coast of [[Cuba]]. It has served as a refuge for boats for many years. It has two of the most important ports in the country, one of which is the city of [[Cienfuegos]], the capital of the province.

==History==
On his second vogage to the Americas, [[Christopher Columbus]] visited the bay in 1494. The first permanent settlements occurred in 1738. The [[Castillo de Jagua|Jagua Fortress]] was erected by King [[Philip V of Spain]] in 1742 to protect the bay from pirates who prowled the Caribbean coast in those days. They used it as refuge at landfall, on their way to the city of Cienfuegos.&lt;ref name=ecured /&gt;

'''Decimal degrees''' (DD) express [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] [[Geographic coordinate system|geographic coordinates]] as [[decimal fractions]] and are used in many [[geographic information system]]s (GIS), [[web mapping]] applications such as [[OpenStreetMap]], and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] devices. Decimal degrees are an alternative to using degrees, minutes, and seconds (DMS).  As with latitude and longitude, the values are bounded by ±90° and ±180° respectively.

Positive latitudes are north of the equator, negative latitudes are south of the equator. Positive longitudes are east of [[Prime Meridian]], negative longitudes are west of the Prime Meridian. Latitude and longitude are usually expressed in that sequence, latitude before longitude.

==Precision==
The radius of the [[semi-major axis]] of the [[Earth]] at the [[equator]] is 6,378,137.0 meters&lt;ref&gt;[http://epsg.io/7030-ellipsoid World Geodetic System]&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a circumference of 40,075,161.2 meters. The equator is divided into 360 degrees of longitude, so each degree at the equator represents 111,319.9 meters or approximately 111.32&amp;nbsp;km. As one moves away from the equator towards a pole, however, one degree of longitude is multiplied by the cosine of the latitude, decreasing the distance, approaching zero at the pole. The number of decimal places required for a particular precision at the equator is:

A value in decimal degrees to a precision of 4 decimal places is precise to 11.132 meters at the [[equator]].  A value in decimal degrees to 5 decimal places is precise to 1.1132 meter at the equator.  Elevation also introduces a small error.  At 6,378 m elevation, the radius and surface distance is increased by 0.001 or 0.1%.  Because the [[earth]] is not flat, the precision of the longitude part of the coordinates increases the further from the equator you get.  The precision of the latitude part does not increase so much, more strictly however, a [[meridian arc]] length per 1 second depends on latitude at point concerned.  The discrepancy of 1 second meridian arc length between equator and pole is about 0.3 metres because the earth is an [[oblate spheroid]].

==Example==
A [[Geographic coordinate system#Degrees: a measurement of angle|DMS]] value is converted to decimal degrees using the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{D}_\text{dec} = \mathrm{D} + \frac{\mathrm{M}}{60} + \frac{\mathrm{S}}{3600}&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, the decimal degree representation for
:38° 53′ 23″ N, 77° 00′ 32″ W

(the location of the [[United States Capitol]]) is
:38.8897°, -77.0089°

In most systems, such as [[OpenStreetMap]], the degree symbols are omitted, reducing the representation to
:[https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=38.8897&amp;mlon=-77.0089#map=19/38.8897/-77.0089 38.8897,-77.0089]

To calculate the D, M and S components, the following formulas can be used:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathrm{D} &amp;= \operatorname{trunc}(\mathrm{D}_\text{dec}) \\
  \mathrm{M} &amp;= \operatorname{trunc}((|\mathrm{D}_\text{dec}| \times 60)\,\bmod\,60) \\
  \mathrm{S} &amp;= \left(|\mathrm{D}_\text{dec}| \times 3600 \right)\,\bmod\,60
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where |D{{sub|dec}}| is the [[absolute value]] of D{{sub|dec}}, ''trunc'' is the [[truncation]] function, and ''mod'' is the [[modulo operation|modulo operator]]. Note that with this formula, only D can be negative and only S may have a fractional value.

'''Ge Jianxiong''' ({{zh|s=葛剑雄}}; born 15 December 1945) is a Chinese [[historical geographer]]. He is a professor and the former Director of the Institute of Historical Geography of [[Fudan University]] in [[Shanghai]], and Director of the Fudan University Library. His research focus is on historical population movements and human geography. Ge is also a well-known public figure in China. He is a member of the Standing Committee of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC) and is on the Advisory Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Government.

==Biography==
Ge Jianxiong was born on 15 December 1945 in [[Nanxun]], Wuxing County (now [[Huzhou]]), [[Zhejiang]], China. He graduated from Chang'an Middle School and Shibei High School. After a year of teacher's training, he taught at Gutian High School in [[Zhabei]], Shanghai.&lt;ref name=fudan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yugong.fudan.edu.cn/views/about_leaders.php |title=历任领导 |publisher=Center for Historical Geographical Studies, Fudan University |accessdate=18 November 2017 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[National Higher Education Entrance Examination]] was restored after the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], Ge took the graduate examination. Despite having never attended college, he excelled in the exam and was admitted to the graduate school of [[Fudan University]] to study historical geography under the famous scholar, academician [[Tan Qixiang]].&lt;ref name=whb/&gt; In 1981 he earned a master's degree in history, and in 1983, Ge and his classmate [[Zhou Zhenhe]] became the first two recipients of the doctoral degree in humanities (文科博士) in the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref name=whb/&gt; His dissertation, ''Population Geography of the Western Han Dynasty'', was published as a [[monograph]] by the [[People's Publishing House]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=whb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.confucianism.com.cn/html/jiaoyu/7467158.html |script-title=zh:记全国首批文科博士周振鹤、葛剑雄教授 |language=Chinese |work=[[Wen Hui Bao]] |date=2 December 2008 |accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ge has been a faculty member of the Institute of Historical Geography of Fudan University since 1981, and became a full professor in 1991. He served as Director of the Institute of Historical Geography from 1996 to 2006.&lt;ref name=fudan/&gt; He is also Director of the Fudan University Library.&lt;ref name=usc/&gt;

He was a visiting scholar at [[Harvard University]] (1985–1986) and the [[University of Cambridge]] (1998), and a visiting professor at the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences]] (1991) and the [[International Research Center for Japanese Studies]] (1997–1998).&lt;ref name=fudan/&gt;

Ge also writes popular columns and blogs in the mainstream media and is a well-known public figure in China. He is a member of the Standing Committee of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC) and is on the Advisory Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Government.&lt;ref name=usc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://china.usc.edu/calendar/talk-ge-jianxiong |title=A Talk By Ge Jianxiong |publisher=[[University of Southern California]] |accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26989">{{distinguish|ICAO airport code|text=|selfref=}}
An '''IATA airport code''', also known as an '''IATA location identifier''', '''IATA station code''' or simply a '''location identifier''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iata.org/codes|title=IATA - Codes - Airline and Airport Codes Search|first=|last=IATA|website=www.iata.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a three-letter code designating many [[airport]]s around the world, defined by the [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA). The characters prominently displayed on [[bag tag|baggage tags]] attached at airport check-in desks are an example of a way these codes are used.

The assignment of these codes is governed by IATA Resolution 763, and it is administered by IATA headquarters in [[Montreal]]. The codes are published semiannually in the IATA Airline Coding Directory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iata.org/coding|title=IATA - Airline Coding Directory|first=|last=IATA|website=www.iata.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IATA also provides codes for [[railway]] stations and for airport handling entities. A [[list of airports]] sorted by IATA code is available. A [[List of IATA-indexed railway stations|list of railway station codes]], shared in agreements between airlines and rail lines such as [[Amtrak]], [[SNCF|SNCF French Rail]], and [[Deutsche Bahn]], is available. Many railway administrations have their own list of codes for their stations, such as the [[list of Amtrak station codes]].

==List==

==History and conventions==
Airport codes arose out of the convenience that it brought pilots for location identification in the 1930s. Initially, pilots in the United States used the two-letter code from the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) for identifying cities. This system became unmanageable for cities and towns without an NWS identifier, thus a three-letter system of airport codes was implemented. This system allowed for 17,576 permutations, assuming all letters can be used in conjunction with each other.&lt;ref name=sky&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport ABCs: An Explanation of Airport Identifier Codes|year=1994|url=http://www.skygod.com/asstd/abc.html|work=Air Line Pilot|publisher=Air Line Pilots Association|accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, airport codes are named after the first three letters of the city in which it is located—[[Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport|ATL]] for [[Atlanta]], [[Singapore Changi Airport|SIN]] for [[Singapore]], [[Silvio Pettirossi International Airport|ASU]] for [[Asunción]], [[Benito Juárez International Airport|MEX]] for [[Mexico City]], [[Denver International Airport|DEN]] for [[Denver]]; [[Istanbul Atatürk Airport|IST]] for [[Istanbul]]; or a combination of the letters in its name, [[Newark Liberty International Airport|EWR]] for [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla International Airport|GDL]] for [[Guadalajara]], [[O. R. Tambo International Airport|JNB]] for [[Johannesburg]], [[Hong Kong International Airport|HKG]] for [[Hong Kong]], [[Salt Lake City International Airport|SLC]] for [[Salt Lake City]] and [[Warsaw Chopin Airport|WAW]] for [[Warsaw]]. Some airports in the United States retained their NWS codes and simply appended an X at the end, such as [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]] for [[Los Angeles]], [[Portland International Airport|PDX]] for [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], and [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport|PHX]] for [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].&lt;ref name=sky/&gt;

Sometimes the airport code reflects pronunciation, rather than spelling, such as [[Nadi International Airport|NAN]], which reflects the pronunciation of "Nadi" as {{IPA-fj|ˈnandi|}} in [[Fijian language|Fijian]], where "d" is realized as the [[Prenasalized consonant|prenasalized stop]] {{IPA|[ⁿd]}}.

For many reasons, some airport codes do not fit the normal scheme described above. Some airports, for example, cross several municipalities or regions, and mix the letters around, giving rise to DFW for [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|'''D'''allas–'''F'''ort '''W'''orth]], DTW for [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport|'''D'''e'''t'''roit–'''W'''ayne County]], LBA for [[Leeds Bradford International Airport|'''L'''eeds '''B'''radford ('''A'''irport)]], MSP for [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport|'''M'''inneapolis–'''S'''aint '''P'''aul]], and RDU for [[Raleigh–Durham International Airport|'''R'''aleigh–'''Du'''rham]].

{{citation needed span|text=Canada originally used two letters for identification of a weather reporting station in the 1930s. Additionally, preceding the two-letter code, was placed a Y (meaning "yes") where the reporting station was co-located with an airport, a W (meaning "without") where the reporting station was not co-located with an airport, and a U where the reporting station was co-located with an [[Non-directional beacon|NDB]]. An X was used if the last two letters of the code had already been taken by another Canadian ident, and a Z was used if the locator could be confused with a U.S. three letter ident.|date=April 2018}}

===Cities with multiple airports===
In large metropolitan areas, airport codes are often named after the airport itself instead of the city it serves, while another code is reserved which refers to the city itself. For instance:

* [[Berlin]] (BER)&amp;nbsp;– [[Berlin Tegel Airport]] (TXL) and [[Berlin Schönefeld Airport]] (SXF), and the under construction [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] (BER)
* [[Bucharest]] (BUH)&amp;nbsp;– [[Henri Coandă International Airport|Otopeni]] (OTP) is named after the town of [[Otopeni|'''Ot'''o'''p'''eni]] which the airport is located, while the city also has another airport inside the city limits, [[Aurel Vlaicu International Airport|Băneasa]] (BBU).
* [[Buenos Aires]] (BUE)&amp;nbsp;– [[Ministro Pistarini International Airport|Ezeiza]] (EZE) is named after the suburb in [[Ezeiza Partido]] which the airport is located, while [[Aeroparque Jorge Newbery]] (AEP) is in the city proper.
* [[Chicago]] (CHI)&amp;nbsp;– [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]] (ORD), named after '''Or'''chard Fiel'''d''', the airport's former name, and [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway]] (MDW)
* [[Jakarta]] (JKT)&amp;nbsp;– [[Soekarno–Hatta International Airport|Soekarno–Hatta]] (CGK) is named after '''C'''en'''gk'''areng, the [[Cengkareng|district in which the airport is located]], while the city also has another airport, [[Halim Perdanakusuma Airport|Halim Perdanakusuma]] (HLP). JKT had referred to the city's former airport, [[Kemayoran Airport]] which is now closed.
* [[London]] (LON)&amp;nbsp;– [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]] (LHR), [[Gatwick]] (LGW), [[London City Airport|London City]] (LCY),&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]] (STN), [[Luton Airport|Luton]] (LTN) and [[London Southend Airport|Southend]] (SEN)
* [[Milan]] (MIL)&amp;nbsp;– [[Milan–Malpensa Airport|Malpensa]] (MXP), [[Linate Airport|Linate]] (LIN) and [[Orio al Serio Airport|Orio al Serio]] (BGY)
* [[Miami]] (MIA)&amp;nbsp;– [[Miami International Airport|Miami]] (MIA), [[Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport|Fort Lauderdale]] (FLL), [[Palm Beach International Airport|West Palm Beach]] (PBI)
* [[Montreal]] (YMQ)&amp;nbsp;– [[Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport|Trudeau]] (YUL), [[Montréal-Mirabel International Airport|Mirabel]] (YMX), and [[Montréal/Saint-Hubert Airport|Saint-Hubert]] (YHU)
* [[Moscow]] (MOW)&amp;nbsp;– [[Sheremetyevo International Airport|Sheremetyevo]] (SVO), [[Domodedovo International Airport|Domodedovo]] (DME), [[Vnukovo International Airport|Vnukovo]] (VKO)
* [[New York City]] (NYC)&amp;nbsp;– [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|John F. Kennedy]] (JFK, formerly Idlewild (IDL)), [[La Guardia Airport|La Guardia]] (LGA), and [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark Liberty]] (EWR)
* [[Osaka]] (OSA)&amp;nbsp;– [[Kansai International Airport|Kansai]] (KIX) and [[Osaka International Airport|Itami]] (ITM, formerly OSA)
* [[Paris]] (PAR)&amp;nbsp;– [[Orly Airport|Orly]] (ORY), [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Charles de Gaulle]] (CDG), [[Paris–Le Bourget Airport]] (LBG) and [[Beauvais–Tillé Airport]] (BVA)
* [[Rio de Janeiro]] (RIO)&amp;nbsp;– [[Galeão Airport|Galeão]] (GIG) and [[Santos Dumont Airport|Santos Dumont]] (SDU)
* [[Rome]] (ROM)&amp;nbsp;– [[Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport|Fiumicino]] (FCO) and [[Ciampino Airport|Ciampino]] (CIA)
* [[São Paulo]] (SAO)&amp;nbsp;– [[Congonhas Airport|Congonhas]] (CGH), [[São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport|Guarulhos]] (GRU) and [[Viracopos International Airport|Campinas]] (VCP)
* [[Sapporo]] (SPK)&amp;nbsp;– [[New Chitose Airport|Chitose]] (CTS) and [[Okadama Airport|Okadama]] (OKD)
* [[Seoul]] (SEL)&amp;nbsp;– [[Incheon Airport|Incheon]] (ICN) and [[Gimpo Airport|Gimpo]] (GMP, formerly SEL)
* [[Stockholm]] (STO)&amp;nbsp;– [[Stockholm–Arlanda Airport|Arlanda]] (ARN), [[Stockholm–Bromma Airport|Bromma]] (BMA), [[Stockholm Skavsta Airport|Nyköping–Skavsta]] (NYO) and [[Stockholm Västerås Airport|Västerås]] (VST)
* [[Tokyo]] (TYO)&amp;nbsp;– [[Haneda Airport|Haneda]] (HND) and [[Narita Airport|Narita]] (NRT)
* [[Toronto]] (YTO)&amp;nbsp;– [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Pearson]] (YYZ), [[Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport|Bishop]] (YTZ), [[John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport|Hamilton]] (YHM), and [[Region of Waterloo International Airport|Waterloo]] (YKF)
* [[Washington, D.C.]] (WAS)&amp;nbsp;– [[Dulles International Airport|Dulles]] (IAD), [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Reagan]] (DCA), and [[Baltimore–Washington International Airport|Baltimore–Washington]] (BWI)

Or using a code for the city in one of the major airport and then assign another code to another airport:
* [[Bangkok]] (BKK)&amp;nbsp;– [[Suvarnabhumi Airport|Suvarnabhumi]] (BKK) and [[Don Mueang International Airport|Don Mueang]] (DMK)
* [[Beijing]] (BJS)&amp;nbsp;– [[Beijing Capital International Airport|Capital]] (PEK) and [[Nanyuan Airport|Nanyuan]] (NAY)
* [[Dallas]] (DFW)&amp;nbsp;- [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]] (DFW) and [[Dallas Love Field]] (DAL)
* [[Dubai]] (DXB)&amp;nbsp;– [[Dubai International Airport|International]] (DXB) and [[Al Maktoum International Airport|Al Maktoum]] (DWC)
* [[Houston]] (HOU)&amp;nbsp;- [[William P. Hobby Airport]] (HOU) and [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] (IAH)
* [[Johannesburg]] (JNB)&amp;nbsp;– [[O. R. Tambo International Airport|O. R. Tambo (formerly Jan Smuts)]] (JNB) and [[Lanseria International Airport|Lanseria]] (HLA)
* [[Kiev]] (IEV)&amp;nbsp;– [[Kyiv International Airport (Zhuliany)]] (IEV) and [[Boryspil International Airport]] (KBP)
* [[Kuala Lumpur]] (KUL)&amp;nbsp;– [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport|Sepang]] (KUL) and [[Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport|Subang]] (SZB)
* [[Medellín]] (MDE)&amp;nbsp;– [[José María Córdova International Airport|José María Córdova]] (MDE) and [[Olaya Herrera Airport|Olaya Herrera]] (EOH)
* [[Nagoya]] (NGO)&amp;nbsp;– [[Chubu Centrair International Airport|Centrair]] (NGO) and [[Nagoya Airfield|Komaki]] (NKM)
* [[Shanghai]] (SHA)&amp;nbsp;– [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport|Pudong]] (PVG) and [[Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport|Hongqiao]] (SHA)
* [[Taipei]] (TPE)&amp;nbsp;– [[Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport|Taoyuan]] (TPE) and [[Taipei Songshan Airport|Songshan]] (TSA)
* [[Tehran]] (THR)&amp;nbsp;– [[Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport|Imam Khomeini]] (IKA) and [[Mehrabad International Airport|Mehrabad]] (THR)

When different cities with the same name each have an airport, the airports need to be assigned different codes. For example,
* [[Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport]] (BHM) is in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], United States and [[Birmingham Airport]] (BHX) is in [[Birmingham]], England, United Kingdom.
* [[Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport]] (SJC) is in [[San Jose, California]], United States and [[Juan Santamaría International Airport]] (SJO) is in San José, Costa Rica.
* [[Portland International Jetport]] (PWM) is in [[Portland, Maine]], while [[Portland International Airport]] (PDX) is in [[Portland, Oregon]].

Sometimes, a new airport is built, replacing the old one, leaving the city's new "major" airport code to no longer correspond with the city's name. The original airport in Nashville, Tennessee was built in 1936 as part of the Works Progress Administration and called Berry Field with the designation, BNA. A new facility known as Nashville International Airport was built in 1987 but still uses BNA. This is in conjunction to rules aimed to avoid confusion that seem to apply in the United States, which state that "the first and second letters or second and third letters of an identifier may not be duplicated with less than 200 [[nautical mile]]s separation."&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; Thus, Washington D.C. area's three airports all have radically different codes: IAD for [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington–Dulles]], DCA for [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Washington–Reagan]] (District of Columbia Airport), and BWI for [[Baltimore Airport|Baltimore]] (Baltimore–Washington International, formerly BAL).&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; Since HOU is used for [[William P. Hobby Airport]], the new [[Houston–Intercontinental]] became IAH.&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; The code BKK was originally assigned to [[Don Mueang International Airport|Bangkok–Don Mueang]] and was later transferred to [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]], while the former adopted DMK. [[Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport|Shanghai–Hongqiao]] retained the code SHA, while the newer [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport|Shanghai–Pudong]] adopted PVG. The opposite is true for [[Berlin]], the airport [[Berlin Tegel Airport|Berlin–Tegel]] uses the code TXL, while its smaller counterpart [[Berlin Schönefeld Airport|Berlin–Schönefeld]] uses SXF; the new [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] is going to have the code BER. Hamburg (HAM) and Hannover (HAJ) are less than 100 NM apart and still use the same first and middle letter, indicating that this rule might be followed only locally.

===Cities or airports changing names===
Many cities retain historical names in their airport codes, despite the fact that their official name or its official spelling or transliteration is now different:
* in [[Armenia]]: [[Shirak Airport|LWN]] for [[Gyumri]] (formerly Leninakan)
* in [[Bangladesh]]: [[Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport|DAC]] for [[Dhaka]] (formerly [[Dacca]])
* in [[Canada]]: [[Iqaluit Airport|YFB]] for [[Iqaluit]] (formerly Frobisher Bay)
* in [[China]]: [[Beijing Capital International Airport|PEK]] for Beijing (formerly Peking), [[Tianjin Binhai International Airport|TSN]] for [[Tianjin]] (formerly Tientsin), [[Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport|CKG]] for [[Chongqing]] (formerly Chungking), [[Qingdao Airport|TAO]] for [[Qingdao]] (formerly Tsingtao), and [[Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport|CAN]] for [[Guangzhou]] (formerly Canton). The older IATA codes follow [[Chinese postal romanization]], introduced in 1906, officially abolished in 1964 and in use well into the 1980s, while gradually superseded by [[Pinyin]]
* in [[Greenland]]:  most airports, including [[Kangerlussuaq Airport|SFJ]] for [[Kangerlussuaq]] (formerly Søndre Strømfjord) and [[Nuuk Airport|GOH]] for [[Nuuk]] (formerly Godthåb)
* in [[India]]: BLR for Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore), [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport|BOM]] for [[Mumbai]] (formerly [[Bombay]]), [[Kolkata Airport|CCU]] for [[Kolkata]] (formerly [[Calcutta]]), and [[Chennai International Airport|MAA]] for [[Chennai]] (formerly [[Madras]])
* in [[Indonesia]]: [[Radin Inten II Airport|TKG]] for [[Bandar Lampung]] (formerly Tanjung Karang), [[Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport|UPG]] for [[Makassar]] (formerly Ujung Pandang). In addition, when the [[Enhanced Indonesian Spelling System]] was introduced in 1972, a few older IATA codes retained the previous spelling: [[Sultan Iskandar Muda International Airport|BTJ]] for [[Banda Aceh]] (formerly Banda Atjeh), [[Sentani International Airport|DJJ]] for [[Jayapura]] (formerly Djajapura), [[Adisutjipto International Airport|JOG]] for [[Yogyakarta]] (formerly Jogjakarta)
* in [[Kazakhstan]]: [[Astana International Airport|TSE]] for [[Astana]] (formerly Tselinograd), [[Aktau Airport|SCO]] for [[Aktau]] (formerly Shevchenko), [[Atyrau Airport|GUW]] for [[Atyrau]] (formerly Guryev), [[Taraz Airport|DMB]] for [[Taraz]] (formerly Dzhambyl), [[Semey Airport|PLX]] for [[Semey]] (formerly Semipalatinsk)
* in [[Kyrgyzstan]]: [[Manas International Airport|FRU]] for [[Bishkek]] (formerly Frunze)
* in [[Moldova]]: [[Chișinău International Airport|KIV]] for [[Chișinău]] (formerly Kishinev)
* in [[Montenegro]]: [[Podgorica Airport|TGD]] for [[Podgorica]] (formerly Titograd)
* in [[Myanmar]]: [[Yangon International Airport|RGN]] for [[Yangon]] (formerly Rangoon)

Some airport codes are based on previous names associated with a present airport, often with military heritage.  These include as Chicago's [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]], which is assigned ORD, based on its old name of Orchard Field, before it was expanded and renamed O'Hare in the mid-1950s. Similarly, [[Orlando International Airport]] uses MCO, based on the old McCoy Air Force Base, which was converted to joint civilian/military use and renamed Orlando Jetport at McCoy in the early 1960s and finally Orlando International in the early 1980s. Other airport codes are similarly not immediately obvious in origin, and each have their own peculiarities. Nashville uses [[Nashville Airport|BNA]] (Berry Field, henceforth ''B''erry ''N''ashville ''A''irport), [[Knoxville]] uses [[McGhee Tyson Airport|TYS]], for [[Charles McGhee Tyson]], whose family donated the land for the first airport in Knoxville, and [[Kahului]] (the main gateway into [[Maui]]) uses [[Kahului Airport|OGG]], while [[Spokane International Airport]] goes by GEG. Most of these are named after individuals.&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; In Asia, codes that do not correspond with their city's names include [[Niigata (city)|Niigata]]'s [[Niigata Airport|KIJ]], [[Nanchang]]'s [[Nanchang Airport|KHN]], [[Pyongyang]]'s [[Pyongyang International Airport|FNJ]], and [[Kobe]]'s [[Kobe Airport|UKB]].

Some airports are identified even in colloquial speech by their airport code. The most notable examples are LAX and JFK.

===National policies===
Since the [[U.S. Navy]] reserved "N" codes and the [[Federal Communications Commission]] has [[Call signs in North America|reserved rights for "W" and "K"]], certain U.S. cities which begin with these letters had to adopt "irregular" airport codes: EWR for Newark, [[Norfolk International Airport|ORF]] for [[Norfolk, Virginia]], EYW for [[Key West, Florida]], and [[Napa County Airport|APC]] for [[Napa, California]].&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; This "rule" does not apply outside the United States: [[Karachi]] is KHI, [[Warsaw]] is WAW, [[Nagoya]] is NGO. In addition, since "Q" was used for international communications, cities with "Q" beginning their name also had to find alternate codes, as in the case of [[Qiqihar]] (NDG), [[Quetta]] (UET) and [[Quito]] (UIO).

IATA codes should not be confused with the [[Location identifier#FAA identifier|FAA identifiers]] of US airports. Most FAA identifiers agree with the corresponding IATA codes, but some do not, such as [[Saipan International Airport|Saipan]] whose FAA identifier is GSN and its IATA code is SPN, and some coincide with IATA codes of non-US airports.

Most large airports in Canada have codes that begin with the letter "Y", although not all "Y" codes are Canadian (for example, YUM for Yuma, Arizona) and not all Canadian airports start with the letter "Y" (for example ZBF for Bathurst, New Brunswick). Many Canadian airports have a code that starts with W, X or Z, but none of these are major airports. When the Canadian transcontinental railways were built, each station was assigned its own two letter Morse code. VR was Vancouver, TZ Toronto, QB Quebec, WG Winnipeg, SJ St. Johns, YC Calgary, OW Ottawa, EG Edmonton, etc. When the Canadian government established airports, it used the existing railway codes for them as well. If the airport had a weather station, authorities added a "Y" to the front of the code, meaning "Yes" to indicate it had a weather station, or some other letter to indicate it did not. When international codes were created in cooperation with the United States, because "Y" was seldom used in the US, Canada simply used the weather station codes for its airports, changing the "Y" to a "Z" if it conflicted with an airport code already in use. The result is that most major Canadian airport codes start with "Y" followed by two letters in the city's name: [[Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport|YOW]] for [[Ottawa]], [[Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport|YWG]] for [[Winnipeg]], [[Calgary International Airport|YYC]] for [[Calgary]], and [[Vancouver International Airport|YVR]] for [[Vancouver]], whereas other Canadian airports append the two letter code of the radio beacons that were the closest to the actual airport, such as [[Gander International Airport|YQX]] in [[Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador|Gander]] and [[Prince George Airport|YXS]] in [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]].

Four of the ten provincial capital airports in Canada have ended up with codes beginning with YY, including YYZ for Toronto, Ontario, YYJ for Victoria, British Columbia, YYT for St. John's, Newfoundland, and YYG for Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Canada's largest airport is YYZ for [[Toronto–Pearson International Airport|Toronto–Pearson]] (YTZ was used for Toronto City Airport, so YYZ is the station code for a village called Malton, which is where Toronto Pearson International Airport is actually located). YUL is used for [[Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport|Montréal–Trudeau]] (UL was the ID code for beacon in the city of Kirkland, now the location of Montréal–Trudeau). While these codes make it difficult for the public to associate them with a particular Canadian city, some codes have become popular in usage despite their cryptic nature, particularly at the largest airports. Toronto's YYZ code has entered pop culture in the form of [[YYZ_(instrumental)|a popular rock song]] utilizing the "YYZ" Morse code signal. Some airports have started using their IATA codes as marketing brands. [[Calgary International Airport]] has begun using its airport code YYC as a marketing brand and name for the airport authority web site (yyc.com),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YYC: Calgary Airport Authority |url=http://www.yyc.com/|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Vancouver International Airport]] advertises as YVR (yvr.com).

Numerous New Zealand airports use codes which contain a letter Z, to distinguish them from similar airport names in other countries. Examples include [[Hamilton Airport (New Zealand)|HLZ]] for [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], [[Queenstown Airport|ZQN]] for [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]], and [[Westport Airport (New Zealand)|WSZ]] for [[Westport, New Zealand|Westport]].

===Lack of codes===
It is also noteworthy that there are several airports with scheduled service that have not been assigned ICAO codes that do have IATA codes. For example, several airports in Alaska that have scheduled commercial service, such as [[Stebbins Airport]] or [[Nanwalek Airport]], using [[Location identifier|FAA codes instead]]. There are also airports with scheduled service for which there are ICAO codes but not IATA codes, such as [[Nkhotakota Airport]]/[[Tangole Airport]] in [[List of airports in Malawi|Malawi]] or [[Chōfu Airport]] in Tokyo, Japan. Also several minor airports in [[Russia]] (e.g. [[Omsukchan Airport]]) which instead use [[Location identifier|internal Russian codes]] for booking. Flights to these airports can't be booked through the international air booking systems (or have luggage transferred all the way), instead booked through the airline or a domestic booking system. Thus, neither system completely includes all airports with scheduled service.

'''ISO 3166-2:CA''' is the entry for [[Canada]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Canada, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[provinces and territories of Canada|10 provinces and 3 territories]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|CA}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Canada. The second part is two letters, which is the [[Canadian postal abbreviations for provinces and territories|postal abbreviation for the province or territory]].

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

[[ISO 639-1]] codes are used to represent subdivision names in the following [[official language|administrative language]]s:
* (en): [[English language|English]]
* (fr): [[French language|French]]

{{History of Xinjiang}}
The '''Kingdom of Khotan''' was an ancient [[Iranian peoples|Iranic]] [[Saka]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] kingdom located on the branch of the [[Silk Road]] that ran along the southern edge of the [[Taklamakan Desert]] in the [[Tarim Basin]] (modern [[Xinjiang]], [[China]]). The ancient capital was originally sited to the west of modern-day [[Hotan]] ({{zh|c=和田}}) at Yotkan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stein|first=M. Aurel|title=Ancient Khotan|year=1907|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Asian Civilizations |url=https://books.google.com/?id=H1c1UIEVH9gC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author=Charles Higham |page=143 |publisher= Facts on File  |year=2004 |isbn=0-8160-4640-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Han dynasty]] until at least the [[Tang dynasty]] it was known in Chinese as '''Yutian''' ({{zh|c=于闐}}, 于窴, or 於闐). This [[Chinese Buddhism|largely Buddhist]] kingdom existed for over a thousand years until it was conquered by the [[Muslim]] [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] in 1006, during the [[Islamicisation and Turkicisation of Xinjiang]].

Built on an oasis, Khotan's mulberry groves allowed the production and export of [[silk]] and [[carpet]]s, in addition to the city's other major products such as its famous [[nephrite]] jade and [[pottery]]. Despite being a significant city on the silk road as well as a notable source of jade for ancient China, Khotan itself is relatively small – the circumference of the ancient city of Khotan at Yōtkan was about 2.5 to 3.2&amp;nbsp;km (1.5 to 2 miles). Much of the archaeological evidence of the ancient city of Khotan however had been obliterated due to centuries of treasure hunting by local people.&lt;ref name="Mallory 2000"/&gt;

The inhabitants of Khotan used [[Saka language|Khotanese]], an [[Eastern Iranian language]], and [[Gāndhārī language|Gandhari Prakrit]], a language related to [[Sanskrit]]. There is debate as to how much Khotan's original inhabitants were ethnically and anthropologically [[South Asia]]n and speakers of the [[Gāndhārī language]] versus the [[Saka]], an [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-European people]] of [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] branch from the [[Eurasian Steppe]]. From the 3rd century onwards they also had a visible linguistic influence on the Gāndhārī language spoken at the royal court of Khotan. The Khotanese Saka language was also recognized as an official court language by the 10th century and used by the Khotanese rulers for administrative documentation.

==Names==
[[File:Portrait of a Khotan King - full.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Portrait of [[Visa Sambhava]], the king of Khotan from [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|Five Dynasties]] to early [[Northern Song|Northern Sung]] period, [[Mogao Caves]], [[Dunhuang]], [[Gansu province]], 10th century]]

The kingdom of Khotan was given various names and transcriptions. The ancient Chinese called Khotan ''Yutian'' (于闐, its ancient pronunciation was ''gi̯wo-d'ien'' or ''ji̯u-d'ien'')&lt;ref name="Mallory 2000"/&gt;  also written as 于窴 and other similar-sounding names such as Yudun (于遁), Huodan (豁旦), and Qudan (屈丹). Sometimes they also used ''Jusadanna'' (瞿薩旦那), derived from Indo-Iranian ''Gostan'' and ''Gostana'', the names of the town and region around it respectively. Others include Huanna (渙那).&lt;ref name="theobald 2011 yutian"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ulrich |last=Theobald |date=16 October 2011 |url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Altera/citystates.html#yutian |title=City-states Along the Silk Road|work= ChinaKnowledge.de |accessdate= 2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the Tibetans in the seventh and eight centuries, the kingdom was called Li (or Li-yul) and the capital city ''Hu-ten'', ''Hu-den'', ''Hu-then'' and ''Yvu-then''.&lt;ref name="khotanese texts"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H4YMQcBlVu0C&amp;pg=PA1 |page=1 |author=H.W. Bailey |title= Khotanese Texts|publisher=Cambridge University Press|edition=reprint |date=31 October 1979|isbn= 978-0521040808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://qkzz.net/magazine/1002-557X/2007/02/1821520.htm |title= 藏文文献中"李域"(li-yul,于阗)的不同称谓 |work=qkzz.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name as written by the locals changed over time; in about the third century AD, the local people wrote ''Khotana'' in Kharoṣṭhī script, and ''Hvatäna'' in the [[Brahmi script]] some time later. From this came ''Hvamna'' and ''Hvam'' in their latest texts, where ''Hvam kṣīra'' or 'the land of Khotan' was the name given. Khotan became known to the west while the –''t''- was still unchanged, as is frequent in early [[Persian language#New Persian|New Persian]]. The local people also used ''Gaustana'' (''Gostana'' or ''Kustana'') under the influence of [[Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit]],  and ''Yūttina'' in the ninth century, when it was allied with the Sinicised kingdom of Șacū (Shazhou or [[Dunhuang]]).&lt;ref name="khotanese texts"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huaxia-ng.com/web/?action-viewnews-itemid-1058 |title=神秘消失的古国（十）：于阗 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206203501/http://www.huaxia-ng.com/web/?action-viewnews-itemid-1058 |archivedate= 6 February 2008 |work=华夏地理互动社区 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and geography==
[[File:Khotan clay figurines.jpg|thumb|left|Clay figurines found in Yotkan, 2nd-4th century]]
The geographical position of the oasis was the main factor in its success and wealth. To its north is one of the most arid and desolate desert climates on the earth, the [[Taklamakan Desert]], and to its south the largely uninhabited [[Kunlun Mountains]] (Qurum).  To the east there were few oasis beyond [[Niya (Tarim Basin)|Niya]] making travel difficult, and access is only relatively easy from the west.&lt;ref name="Mallory 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/hhshu/notes4.html |title=Section 4 – The Kingdom of Yutian 于寘 (modern Khotan or Hetian) }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Khotan was irrigated from the Yurung-kàsh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/toyobunko/VIII-5-B2-11/V-1/page-hr/0043.html.en |title=Memoir on Maps of Chinese Turkistan and Kansu : vol.1 |first=Aurel |last=Stein}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kara-kàsh rivers, which water the [[Tarim Basin]]. These two rivers produce vast quantities of water which made habitation possible in an otherwise arid climate. The position next to the mountain not only provided irrigation for crops but it also increased the fertility of the land as the rivers reduce the gradient and deposited their sediment, creating a more fertile soil. This therefore increased the productivity of the agricultural industry which has made Khotan famous for its cereal crops and fruits. Therefore, Khotan’s lifeline was its vicinity to the Kunlun mountain range and without this Khotan would not have become one of the largest and most successful oasis cities along the Silk Roads.

The kingdom of Khotan was one of the many small states found in the Tarim Basin that included [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]], [[Loulan]] ([[Shanshan]]), [[Turfan]], [[Kingdom of Shule|Kashgar]], [[Karashahr]], and [[Kucha]] (the last three together with Khotan made up the [[Four Garrisons of Anxi|four Garrisons]] during the [[Tang dynasty]]). To the west were Central Asian kingdoms of [[Sogdiana]] and [[Bactria]]. It was surrounded by powerful neighbours, such as the [[Kushan Empire]], [[China]], [[Tibet]], and for a time the [[Xiongnu]], all of which had exerted or tried to exert their influence over Khotan at various times.

==History==
From an early period, the Tarim Basin had been inhabited by different groups of Indo-European speakers such as the [[Tocharians]] and [[Saka]] people.{{sfn|Mukerjee|1964}}&lt;ref&gt;

There are four versions of the legend of the founding of Khotan,&lt;ref name="emmerick 263"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ko_RafMSGLkC&amp;pg=PA263#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author=Emmerick, R.

All four versions suggest that the city was founded around the third century BC by a group of Indians during the reign of [[Ashoka]].&lt;ref name="Mallory 2000"&gt;

According to one version, the nobles of a tribe in [[Taxila (ancient)|ancient Taxila]], who traced their ancestry to the deity [[Vaiśravaṇa]], were said to have blinded Kunãla, a son of [[Ashoka]]. In punishment they were banished by the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan emperor]] to the north of the Himalayas, where they settled in Khotan and elected one of their members as king.  However war then ensued with another group from China whose leader then took over as king, and the two colonies merged.&lt;ref name="Mallory 2000"/&gt; In a different version, it was Kunãla himself who was exiled and founded Khotan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XXGhAL1WKcC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Early History of India|first= Vincent A. |last= Smith | page=193 |publisher= Atlantic Publishers |date= 1999|isbn=978-8171566181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend suggests that Khotan was settled by people from northwest India and China, and may explain the division of Khotan into an eastern and western city since the Han dynasty.&lt;ref name="Mallory 2000"/&gt;  Others however argued that the legend of the founding of Khotan is a fiction as it ignores the Iranian population, and that its purpose was to explain the Indian and Chinese influences that were present in Khotan in the 7th century AD.&lt;ref name="tremblay"/&gt;  By Xuanzang's account, it was believed that the royal power had been transmitted unbroken since the founding of Khotan, and evidence indicates that the kings of Khotan used an Iranian-based word as their title since at least the 3rd century AD, suggesting that they may be speakers of an Iranian language.&lt;ref name="emmerick 2003 p265"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ko_RafMSGLkC&amp;pg=PA265#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author=Emmerick, R.

In the 1900s, [[Aurel Stein]] discovered [[Prakrit]] documents written [[Kharoṣṭhī]] in [[Niya (Tarim Basin)|Niya]], and together with the founding legend of Khotan, Stein proposed that these people in the Tarim Basin were Indian immigrants from Taxila who conquered and colonized Khotan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/toyobunko/VIII-5-B2-19/V-1/page-hr/0171.html.en |title=On Ancient Central-Asian Tracks : vol.1 |first=Aurel |last=Stein |page=91 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of Prakrit however may be a legacy of the influence of the [[Kushan Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ArWLD4Qop38C&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Silk Road: Trade, Travel, War and Faith |first= Susan |last=Whitfield |page=170 |publisher=British Library |date=August 2004|isbn= 978-1932476132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were also Greek influences in early Khotan based on evidence such as [[Hellenistic art]]works found at various sites in the Tarim Basin, for example, the [[Sampul tapestry]] found near Khotan, tapestries depicting the Greek god [[Hermes]] and the winged [[pegasus]] found at nearby [[Loulan]], as well as [[pottery of ancient Greece|ceramics]] that may suggest influences from as far as the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic kingdom]] of the [[Ptolemaic Empire|Ptolemaic Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/cultural_convergence_in_the_northern_qi_period_a_flamboyant_chinese_ceramic_container_a_research# |title=Cultural Convergence in the Northern Qi Period: A Flamboyant Chinese Ceramic Container |first=Valenstein |last= Suzanne G. |date=2007 |work=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="christopoulos 2012 pp15-20"&gt;Christopoulos, Lucas (August 2012), "Hellenes and Romans in Ancient China (240 BC – 1398 AD)," in Victor H.

Documents written in [[Prakrit]] dating to 3rd-century AD from neighbouring [[Shanshan]] show that the king of Khotan was given the title ''hinajha'' (i.e. "generalissimo"), a distinctively Iranian-based word equivalent to the [[Sanskrit]] title ''[[senapati]]''.&lt;ref name="emmerick 2003 p265"/&gt; This along with the fact that the king's recorded regnal periods were given as Khotanese ''kṣuṇa'', "implies an established connection between the Iranian inhabitants and the royal power," according to the late Professor of Iranian Studies Ronald E. Emmerick (d. 2001).&lt;ref name="emmerick 2003 p265"/&gt; He contended that Khotanese-Saka-language royal rescripts of Khotan dated to the 10th century "makes it likely that the ruler of Khotan was a speaker of [[Iranian languages|Iranian]]."&lt;ref name="emmerick 2003 p265"/&gt; Furthermore, he elaborated on the early name of Khotan:

{{quote|The name of Khotan is attested in a number of spellings, of which the oldest form is ''hvatana'', in texts of approximately the 7th to the 10th century AD written in an Iranian language itself called ''hvatana'' by the writers.

===Early period===

In the second century BC a Khotanese king helped the famous ruler [[Kanishka]] of the [[Kushan Empire]] of South Asia (founded by the Indo-Iranian [[Yuezhi]] people) to conquer the key town of [[Saket]] in the [[Middle kingdoms of India]]: {{refn|group=lower-alpha|If this is correct, and if modern dating of the beginning of Kanishka's era in 127 AD, this must have happened at about this date - just before [[Ban Yong]] reasserted Chinese influence over the region.}}

===Turkic-Islamic conquest of Buddhist Khotan===

In the 10th century, the Iranic Saka Buddhist Kingdom of Khotan was the only city-state that was not conquered yet by the Turkic Uyghur (Buddhist) and the Turkic Qarakhanid (Muslim) states. During the latter part of the tenth century, Khotan became engaged in a struggle against the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]].  The Islamic conquests of the Buddhist cities east of Kashgar began with the conversion of the Karakhanid [[Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan]] to Islam in 934. Satuq Bughra Khan and later his son Musa directed endeavors to proselytize Islam among the Turks and engage in military conquests,&lt;ref name="Millward2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Valerie Hansen|title=The Silk Road: A New History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nPg4UVV_JTYC&amp;pg=PA226#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=17 July 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-993921-3|pages=226–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a long war ensued between Islamic Kashgar and Buddhist Khotan.&lt;ref name="MichellGollings2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Michell|author2=John Gollings|author3=Marika Vicziany|author4=Yen Hu Tsui|title=Kashgar: Oasis City on China's Old Silk Road|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hMJC0JSfBkEC&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2008|publisher=Frances Lincoln|isbn=978-0-7112-2913-6|pages=13–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Satuq Bughra Khan's nephew or grandson Ali Arslan was said to have been killed during the war with the Buddhists.&lt;ref name="RingSalkin1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Trudy Ring|author2=Robert M.

{{details|Buddhism in Khotan}}
The kingdom was one of the major centres of Buddhism, and up until the 11th century, the vast majority of the population was Buddhist.&lt;ref&gt;Ehsan Yar-Shater, William Bayne Fisher, ''The Cambridge history of Iran: The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian periods.'' Cambridge University Press, 1983, page 963.&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, the people of the kingdom were not Buddhist, and Buddhism was said to have been adopted in the reign of Vijayasambhava in the first century BC, some 170 years after the founding of Khotan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sluKZfTrr3oC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Buddhism in Central Asia |author= Baij Nath Puri |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|date=December 1987 |isbn= 978-8120803725 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, an account by the Han general [[Ban Chao]] suggested that the people of Khotan  in 73 AD still appeared to practice [[Mazdeism]] or [[Shamanism]].&lt;ref name="tremblay"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kr_M1e7yImoC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= The Spread of Buddhism |editors= Ann Heirman, Stephan Peter Bumbacher |author=Xavier Tremblay }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ma yong"/&gt; His son [[Ban Yong]] who spent time in the [[Western Regions]] also did not mention Buddhism there, and with the absence of Buddhist art in the region before the beginning of [[Eastern Han]], it has also been suggested that Buddhism may not have been adopted in the region until the middle of the second century AD.&lt;ref name="ma yong"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DguGWP0vGY8C&amp;pg=PA238#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=History of Civilizations of Central Asia: The Development of Sedentary  and Nomadic Civilisations: Vol 2 |editor= Janos Harmatta |authors=Ma Yong, Sun Yutang |page=237&amp;ndash;238|isbn=978-8120814080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kingdom is primarily associated with the [[Mahayana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Frances|title=The Silk Road: two thousand years in the heart of Asia|year=2002|location=London|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr|editor2-last=Lopez|editor2-first=Donald S.

Despite scant information on the socio-political structures of Khotan, the shared geography of the Tarim city-states and similarities in archaeological findings throughout the [[Tarim Basin]] enable some conclusions on Khotanese life.&lt;ref&gt;

Xuanzang also praised the culture of Khotan, commenting that its people "love to study literature", and said "[m]usic is much practiced in the country, and men love song and dance." The "urbanity" of the Khotan people is also mentioned in their dress, that of ‘light silks and white clothes’ as opposed to more rural "wools and furs".&lt;ref name=Records /&gt;

=== Silk ===

Khotan was the first place outside of inland China to begin cultivating [[silk]]. The legend, repeated in many sources, and illustrated in murals discovered by archaeologists, is that a Chinese princess brought [[Bombyx mori|silkworm]] eggs hidden in her hair when she was sent to marry the Khotanese king. This probably took place in the first half of the 1st century AD but is disputed by a number of scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Hill (2009). "Appendix A: Introduction of Silk Cultivation to Khotan in the 1st Century CE", pp. 466-467.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:British Museum silk princess painting.jpg|thumb|450px|Painting on wooden panel discovered by Aurel Stein in [[Dandan Oilik]], depicting the legend of the princess who hid [[Bombyx mori|silkworm]] eggs in her headdress to smuggle them out of China to the Kingdom of Khotan.]]

One version of the story is told by the Chinese Buddhist [[bhikkhu|monk]] [[Xuanzang]] who describes the covert transfer of silkworms to Khotan by a Chinese princess. Xuanzang, on his return from India between 640 and 645, crossed Central Asia passing through the kingdoms of [[Kashgar]] and Khotan (Yutian in Chinese).&lt;ref&gt;

According to Xuazang, the introduction of [[sericulture]] to Khotan occurred in the first quarter of the 5th century. The King of Khotan wanted to obtain silkworm eggs, [[Morus (plant)|mulberry]] seeds and Chinese know-how - the three crucial components of silk production. The Chinese court had strict rules against these items leaving China, to maintain the Chinese monopoly on silk manufacture. Xuanzang wrote that the King of Khotan asked for the hand of a Chinese princess in marriage as a token of his allegiance to the Chinese emperor. The request was granted, and an ambassador was sent to the Chinese court to escort the Chinese princess to Khotan. He advised the princess that she would need to bring silkworms and mulberry seeds in order to make herself robes in Khotan and to make the people prosperous. The princess concealed silkworm eggs and mulberry seeds in her headdress and smuggled them through the Chinese frontier. According to his text, silkworm eggs, mulberry trees and weaving techniques passed from Khotan to [[India]], and from there eventually reached [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;

=== Jade ===

Khotan, throughout and before the Silk Roads period, was a prominent trading oasis on the southern route of the Tarim Basin – the only major oasis "on the sole water course to cross the desert from the south".&lt;ref name="Life Along the Silk Roads"&gt;
{{cite book

|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the geographical location of the towns of Khotan it was also important for its wide renown as a significant source of nephrite jade for export to China.

There has been a long history of trade of jade from Khotan to China.  Jade pieces from the Tarim Basin have been found in Chinese archaeological sites. Chinese carvers in [[Xinglongwa culture|Xinglongwa]] and Chahai had been carving ring-shaped pendants "from greenish jade from Khotan as early as 5000 BC".&lt;ref name="The Silk Road Folio"/&gt;  The hundreds of jade pieces found in the [[tomb of Fuhao]] from the late [[Shang dynasty]] by [[Zheng Zhenxiang]] and her team all originated from Khotan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liu |first=Xinru |authorlink=Xinru Liu |title=Migration and Settlement of the Yuezhi-Kushan.

Xuanzang also observed jade on sale in Khotan in 645 and provided a number of examples of the jade trade.&lt;ref name="The Silk Road Folio"&gt;

Most  of  the  soldiers  of  Alexander  the Great who stayed in Persia, India and central Asia had married local women, thus their leading generals were mostly Greeks from their father’s side or had Greco-Macedonian grandfathers. Antiochos had a Persian mother, and all the later Indo-Greeks or Greco-Bactrians were revered in the population as locals, as they used both Greek and Bactrian scripts  on  their  coins  and  worshipped  the  local  gods.  The  DNA  testing  of  the  Sampul  cemetery  shows  that the occupants had paternal origins in the eastern part of the Mediterranean''"; see Christopoulos, Lucas (August 2012), "Hellenes and Romans in Ancient China (240 BC – 1398 AD)," in Victor H.

The primary purpose of agriculture is food production but concern for other objectives (e.g., wildlife, conservation, biodiversity, recreation and scenery) have a long history and are of increasing importance in wealthy and urbanized countries. The [[Set-Aside in the EU|European Union Set-Aside Policy]] was designed as a means of giving money to farmers to produce non-food [[environmental good]]s from farmland. Landscape planners are involved with the preparation of agricultural landscape plans for the achievement of non-food objectives from agricultural land.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="785">'''Large-scale coastal behaviour''' is an attempt to model the [[morphodynamics]] of [[coast]]al change at time and space scales appropriate to management and prediction.  Temporally this is at the [[decade]] to [[century]] scale, spatially at the scale of tens of kilometers.  It was developed by de Vriend.

Modelling large-scale coastal behaviour involves some level of [[parameter]]isation rather than simply upscaling from process or downscaling from the [[Geology|geological]] scale.  It attempts to recognise patterns occurring at these scales.  Cowell and Thom (2005) recognise the need to admit uncertainty in large-scale coastal behaviour given incomplete process knowledge.

'''Latorica Protected Landscape Area''' ({{lang-sk|Chránená krajinná oblasť Latorica}}) is the second lowland [[Protected areas of Slovakia#Protected Landscape Areas|protected landscape area]] in [[Slovakia]]. It is located in the south-eastern Slovakia, in the [[Trebišov District|Trebišov]] and [[Michalovce District|Michalovce]] districts. 

==Geography, geology and ecology==
The park is located around the Slovak part of [[Latorica]] river and around lower part of [[Ondava]] and [[Laborec]] rivers. The landscape area consists of the system of riverbeds and arms, surrounded by alluvial forest and wetlands. The most noticeable phenomenon of the PLA is the rare water and swamp [[biocenose]], unique in Slovakia.

Due to the location and character of this PLA, the area is used by waterfowl, not only for nesting, but also, in the case of migratory birds, for short rests.

A part of river's watershed ("Ramsar site No. 606", 44.05 km²) was added to the [[Ramsar (convention)|Ramsar]] [[list of wetlands of international importance]] since 1993.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7073">'''Laventille''' is a  [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]] of [[Trinidad and Tobago]].

==Etymology==
The name ''Laventille'' hearkens back to colonial times, especially when the [[France|French]] dominated the cultural traditions of the island.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} One etymological derivation of the name is because the northeast trade winds come to this part of the island of [[Trinidad]] before reaching any other part of colonial [[Port of Spain]] – hence the [[metaphor]]ical name ''La Ventaille'' ("The Vent"). Geographically, it is the source of Orographic [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] for the capital city.

==Community and culture==
Laventille  was built by people of poorer communities originally but has since developed into contemporary housing developments.

Laventille is also the place where [[steel pan]] was born, and it is the birthplace of innovators and world-renowned tuners like the late [[Rudolph Charles]], [[Bertie Marshall]] and Roland Harrigin.  It is the heart of the steelpan world, where pioneer [[Winston Simon|Winston "Spree" Simon]] lived and created one of the century’s new acoustical musical instruments. It is home to [[Desperadoes Steel Orchestra]], one of the world's oldest steelbands, still in existence today. It also houses several other bands such as Laventille Hilanders, Courts Laventille Sound Specialists, Tokyo, etc.

Laventille is also the home or birthplace of many people involved in community work and other types of cultural activity in Trinidad &amp; Tobago. [[Soca music|Soca]] artiste [[Destra Garcia]] was born at Desperlie Crescent, former name [[Ovid Alley]]. Laventille is probably the oldest Community in East Port of Spain. It has been said, whenever the enslaved peoples escaped from man's inhumanity to man, they headed to the Hills of Laventille.

The name has also been used as a general term for the neighbourhoods of eastern Port of Spain, including not only Laventille "proper" ([[Success Village]], [[Trou Macaque]], [[Never Dirty]]) but also [[East Dry River, Trinidad|East Dry River]], [[John-John, Trinidad|John-John]], [[Sea Lots]], [[Beetham Estate Gardens]], Caledonia, [[Maryland,Trinidad|Maryland]], [[Mon Repos, Port of Spain|Mon Repos]] and [[Chinapoo, Trinidad|Chinapoo]].

===Economy===
The world famous [[Angostura bitters|Angostura Bitters]] is currently produced at the Angostura compound &lt;ref&gt;Angostura, Our Business, History http://www.angostura.com/ourbusiness/history&lt;/ref&gt; which is located off the Eastern Main Road in Laventille. This product is one of the older products of Trinidad and Tobago which has won many awards and which has been exported to many countries. The bitters forms an essential element in many drinks and dishes.

Many of the rums which are produced in Trinidad are made at the Angostura Compound. These rums are exported to many countries and earn valuable foreign exchange for the country. These rums are also used in ponche a creme, the local equivalent of egg nog.

For many years, MacFoods Meat processors was one of the larger employers in the area, as their factory produced top quality pork hams, marketed under the label "Blue Ribbon" hams.

===Events===

====Laventille Devotions====
For the last thirty plus (30+) years, each year persons from the Roman Catholic parishes in the North of Trinidad, have headed to Laventille on the Sunday closest to the 13th of the month, during the period May - October. For the young and the young at heart, this gathering is a reminder of the visitations of Our Lady of FATIMA the need to pray for the country, each other and the intentions of the Pope and Archbishop using the Rosary as a method of prayer, to gather with their peers and most of all, to give thanks for what has been given to them.

====Coopers trained at Angostura====
In 2015, over a three (3) week period young persons were trained in the art of coopering at Angostura. This training involved the making of barrels from scratch. These barrel which can be used to store the "work in progress of rum" are an intrinsic part of the creation of the rum product.&lt;ref&gt;Coopering at Angostura http://www.angostura.com/News/Releases&lt;/ref&gt;

==Places of interest==

===Angostura Museum and Barcant Butterfly Collection===

The Angostura Museum and Barcant Butterfly Collection are located in the Angostura compound, Eastern Main Road, Laventille.&lt;ref&gt;Angostura, Special Events site http://www.angostura.com/OurBusiness/SpecialEvents&lt;/ref&gt;   The compound is located on 20 acres of land at Trinity Avenue and Eastern Main Road. This compound is located just on the outskirts of Port of Spain, heading towards Morvant. Access is obtained through the Eastern Main Road entrance.  In addition to the Museum, there are several buildings which are located on the compound, such as the Distillery, the Administration Offices and the Special Events Buildings for which bookings can be placed.

===Fernandes Industrial Centre (FIC)===

The Fernandes Industrial Centre (FIC) is located along the Eastern Main Road, close to the Morvant Junction. The FIC stretches from the Main Road, is intersected by the Priority Bus Route and continues to the Churchill Roosevelt Highway (CRH). However the Compound is not accessible from the CRH. The Centre offers warehousing, distribution and operating space for several different types of businesses, some of these are:

~ Foundation for the Enhancement and Enrichment of Life.&lt;ref&gt;FEEL http://www.guardian.co.tt/lifestyle/2012-09-06/feel%E2%80%88it%E2%80%99s-time-shout-about-what-we-do&lt;/ref&gt; This Non Governmental Organisation (NGO) was founded by Mr. Clive Pantin, brother of the late Archbishop Anthony Pantin of the R.C. Archdiocese of Port of Spain,  former principal of Fatima College. The organisation is engaged in the collection, distribution of food items to those in need and other social services.

~Peter Sheppard Studio ~ Peter Sheppard has produced artwork which recreate historical scenes of Trinidad and Tobago.

== Crime ==
{{See also|Crime in Trinidad and Tobago}}
Communities within Laventille - that is, not greater Laventille itself - have some of the highest "serious crimes" statistics in Trinidad and Tobago.  However, because of these crime rates and the dominant Afro Caribbean population dwelling in Laventille,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csp.gov.tt/|title=Maintenance In-progress|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; stereotyping of African Trinidadians, especially male, occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ttparliament.org/about.php?mid=83&amp;q=engaging%20youth%20at%20risk/|title=Trinidad and Tobago Parliament|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.tt/news/2013-05-11/cop-gives-alarming-statistics-188-hot-spots-tt/|title=CoP gives alarming statistics- 188 hot spots In T&amp;amp;T|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is an '''episode list''' for ''[[Still Game]]''. The first series began on September 6, 2002 and its eighth series started on [[BBC One]] on March 8, 2018.

In the first three series, the episode titles were all [[Scots language|Scots]] words that were related to the episode. This was changed to standard English titles for Series 4, so that the national audiences could understand the titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/still_game/trivia/ |title='Still Game' Related Trivia |publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]] |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early series of the show featured short sound clips whenever an establishing shot of Osprey Heights (the building Jack, Victor, Winston, Tam, and Isa live in) occurred. These included Jack and Victor sighing contentedly and one of the two saying "Is that you?" with the other replying "Oh, aye, that's me." Arguably the most common was one where Jack and Victor hummed a song ("Hurdy gurdy gurdy, in the windae boxes"). These decreased in frequency after the first couple of series, and were discontinued altogether by the fourth series.

| ShortSummary    = Winston appeals to his friends for help as [[asbestos]] forces him out of his flat. Isa's birthday is on the horizon and she's on a mission to find out who's throwing her a surprise party. Boabby turfs the regulars out of the Clansman, so they hide in the flat upstairs, stealing booze through a hole cut in the floor, and fishing the alcohol with wires and tack.

| ShortSummary    = Death comes calling to Craiglang when a new undertaker arrives and - for at least one resident - it's time to meet their maker.  As new undertaker I.D Sheathing arrives in Craiglang, it's not long before Isa begins to tell everybody all about him, involving a story about attending the funeral of a young girl, and Sheathing patting a man on the shoulder, and the man dying a week later; Methadone Mick backs her up, with similar stories of his fellow homeless dying due to this funeral director. But is Sheathing really who they believe him to be? Eric falsely claims to have [[sexual intercourse|pumped]] [[Gina Lollobrigida]] in [[Rome]] in 1958. He dies at the [[fruit machine|puggy]] after being touched by Sheathing, although it is later established that Eric died of [[heart failure]], having been ill for some time.

Methadone Mick gets a job as the football mascot but can't help show that the Craiglang team are who he likes best, even going so far as to injure the opposition.

They go away for the night, with Winston in tow, but almost from the beginning, everything appears to go wrong, including Victor eating an entire jam roly-poly, Winston leaving something unholy in the caravan's toilet, and Jack forgetting the alcohol, forcing Winston to go into town to get alcohol and pizza for them - but he promptly spends all the money in the pub on himself! In amongst laughing about old times, including romantic encounters, can they keep the caravan tidy for Navid and Meena?

Below is a sortable '''list of countries by number of Internet users''' as of 2016. [[Internet]] users are defined as persons who accessed the Internet in the last 12 months from any device, including [[mobile phone]]s.&lt;ref group=Note name="sigdigits group=Note"&gt;The data for the number of Internet users is based on multiplying an estimate for the percentage of people using the Internet in a given country from one source (usually the ITU) by the population from another source (usually the U.S. Census Bureau). There are not enough [[significant figures]] in the percentage estimate for the precise Internet user counts found in the table to be meaningful. As a result, they should not be treated as precise figures or even precise estimates.&lt;/ref&gt; The percentages on the list are the percentages of each country's population that are Internet users. Estimates are derived from either household surveys or from Internet subscription data.&lt;ref name="ITU-D"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/material/TelecomICT_Indicators_Definition_March2010_for_web.pdf |title=Definitions of World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators, March 2010 |publisher=[[International Telecommunication Union]] (Geneva) |date=March 2010 |accessdate=28 October 2015 |via=Internet Archive |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220064242/http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/material/TelecomICT_Indicators_Definition_March2010_for_web.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1595">A '''loose snow avalanche''' is an [[avalanche]] formed in [[snow]] with little internal [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]] among individual [[snow crystals]]. Usually very few fatalities  occur from loose snow avalanches, as the avalanches have a tendency to break beneath the person and are usually small even having a path as small as a few centimeters, and as a result are sometimes called "harmless sloughs" that usually at most cause the person to merely fall. However based on the terrain loose snow avalanches can grow large, and have been known to carry people off a cliff and into a crevass or bury them in a gully, and even completely destroy houses and other similar buildings. Ideal conditions for a loose snow avalanche are steep slope angles of 40 degrees and more, persistent sub-zero temperatures and low humidity, moderate to heavy snowfall, and also in an area where winds are very light or are not affecting the density of the snow. This produces light, fluffy snow that is hard or unable to pack.

Small loose snow avalanches can even be a sign of stability of the snow, as slabs are triggered by a hard layer of snow over a very soft and weak layer of snow, and loose snow avalanches consist of a very soft layer of snow on a hard layer or the ground.

'''Lucania''' was a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] province ([[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]]) in [[southern Italy]] that was probably established c. 968, under Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]]. It was situated between the two older Byzantine provinces of [[Longobardia]] in the east and [[Calabria]] in the west, and was formed to encompass the areas in the mostly [[Lombards|Lombard]]-populated theme of Longobardia where [[Byzantine Greeks]] from Calabria had settled in the early 10th century (the regions of Latinianon, [[Lagonegro]] and Mercurion). [[Tursi]] was chosen as the theme's capital and also as the seat of a new [[metropolitan bishopric]] to encompass the province. The theme of Lucania was probably under the overall authority of the [[Catepan of Italy]] at [[Bari]].

The province corresponds roughly to the modern Italian region of [[Basilicata]].

Martini was born in [[Trento]], in the [[Bishopric of Trent]]. After finishing high school studies in Trent in 1631, he entered the [[Society of Jesus]], from where he was sent to study classical letters and [[philosophy]] at the [[Roman College]], [[Rome]] (1634–37). However his interest was more in astronomy and mathematics which he studied under [[Athanasius Kircher]]. His request to be sent as a missionary to China had already been granted by [[Mutius Vitelleschi]], the then [[Superior General]] of the Jesuits. He did his theological studies in [[Portugal]] (1637–39)&amp;mdash;already on his way to China&amp;mdash;where he was ordained priest (1639, in [[Lisbon]]).

==In the Chinese Empire==
He set out for China in 1640, and arrived in [[Portuguese Macau]] in 1642 where he studied Chinese for some time. In 1643 he crossed the border and settled in [[Hangzhou]], [[Zhejiang]] Province, from where he did much traveling in order to gather scientific information, especially on the [[geography]] of the [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Chinese empire]]: he visited several provinces, as well as [[Peking]] and the [[Great Wall]]. He made great use of his talents as [[missionary]], scholar, writer and [[Provincial superior|superior]].

Soon after Martini's arrival to China, the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] capital Beijing fell to [[Li Zicheng]]'s rebels (April, 1644) and then to the [[Manchus]], and the last legitimate Ming emperor, the [[Chongzhen Emperor]], hanged himself. Down in [[Zhenjiang]], Martini continued working with the short-lived regime of [[Zhu Yujian, Prince of Tang]], who set himself up as the [[Southern Ming|(Southern) Ming]] Longwu Emperor. Soon enough, the Manchu troops reached Zhejiang. According to Martini's own report (which appeared in some editions of his ''De bello tartarico''), the Jesuit was able to switch his allegiance to China's new masters in an easy enough, but bold, way. When  [[Wenzhou]], in southern Zhejiang, where Martini happened to be on a mission for Zhu Yujian, was besieged by the Manchus and was about to fall, the Jesuit decorated the house where he was staying with a large red poster with seven characters saying, "Here lives a doctor of the divine Law who has come from the Great West". Under the poster he set up tables with European books, astronomical instruments, etc., surrounding an altar with an image of [[Jesus]]. When the Manchu troops arrived, their commander was sufficiently impressed with the display to approach Martini politely and ask if he wished to switch his loyalty to the new [[Qing Dynasty]]. Martini agreed, and had his head shaved in the Manchu way, and his Chinese dress and hat replaced with Manchu-style ones. The Manchus then allowed him to return to his Hangzhou church, and provided him and the Hangzhou Christian community with necessary protection.&lt;ref Name="Mungello"&gt;{{cite book

==The Chinese Rites affair==
{{further|Chinese Rites controversy}}
In 1651 Martini left China for Rome as the Delegate of the Chinese Mission Superior. He took advantage of the long, adventurous voyage (going first to the [[Philippines]], from thence on a Dutch privateer to [[Bergen]], Norway,&lt;ref&gt;Mungello, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; which he reached on 31 August 1653, and then to [[Amsterdam]]). Further, and still on his way to Rome, he met printers in [[Antwerp]], [[Vienna]] and [[Munich]] to submit to them historical and cartographic data he had prepared. The works  were printed and made him famous.

When passing through [[Leyden]], Martini was met by [[Jacobus Golius]], a scholar of Arabic and Persian at the university there.
Golius did not know Chinese, but had read about "Cathay" in Persian books, and wanted to verify the truth of the earlier reports of Jesuits such as [[Matteo Ricci]] and [[Bento de Góis]] who believed that Cathay is the same place as China where they lived or visited. Golius was familiar with the discussion of the [[Chinese calendar|"Cathayan" calendar]] in  ''[[Zij-i Ilkhani]]'', a work by the Persian astronomer [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], completed in 1272. When Golius met Martini (who, of course knew no Persian), the two scholars found that the names of the  [[Earthly Branches|12 divisions]] into which, according to Nasir al-Din, the "Cathayans" were dividing the day, as well as those of the [[solar term|24 sections of the year]] reported by Nasir al-Din matched those that Martini had learned in China. The story, soon published by Martini in the "Additamentum" to his Atlas of China, seemed to have finally convinced most European scholars that China and Cathay were the same.&lt;ref name=lach1577&gt;{{citation|first1= Donald F. |last1= Lach |first2= Edwin J. |last2= Van Kley|title= Asia in the Making of Europe |place= Chicago |publisher= University of Chicago Press |year= 1994 |isbn= 978-0-226-46734-4}}. Volume III, "A Century of Advance", Book Four, "East Asia", p. 1577.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his way to Rome, Martini met his then 10-year-old cousin [[Eusebio Kino]] who later became another famed [[Jesuit]] missionary explorer and the world-renowned cartographer of New Spain.

In the spring of 1655 Martini reached Rome. There, in Rome, was the most difficult part of his journey.  He had brought along (for the Holy Office of the [[Catholic Church|Church]]) a long and detailed communication from the Jesuit missionaries in China, in defence of their [[Inculturation|inculturated]] missionary and religious approach: the so-called ''[[Chinese Rites]]'' (Veneration of ancestors, and other practices allowed to new Christians). Discussions and debates took place for five months, at the end of which the [[Propaganda Fide]] issued a decree in favour of the [[Jesuits]] (23 March 1656). A battle was won, but the controversy did not abate.

==Return to China==
{{Main article|Immaculate Conception Cathedral of Hangzhou}}
In 1658, after a most difficult journey, he was back in China with the favourable decree. He was again involved in pastoral and missionary activities in the [[Hangzhou]] area where he built a three naves church that was considered to be one of the most beautiful of the country (1659–61). The church was hardly built when he died of [[cholera]] (1661). David E. Mungello wrote that he died of rhubarb overdosing which aggravated his constipation.&lt;ref name="Mungello1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=David E.

===Travels===
Below is a list of cities visited by Martini, traveling in at least fifteen countries in Europe and seven provinces of the Chinese empire, making stops in India, Java, Sumatra, the Philippines and South Africa. After studying at Trent and Rome, Martini reached [[Genoa]], [[Alicante]], [[Cádiz]], [[Sanlucar de Barrameda]] (port near to Seville in Spain), [[Seville]], [[Evora]] and [[Lisbon]] (Portugal), [[Goa]] (in the western region of India), [[Surat]] (port in the northwestern region of India), [[Macao]] (on the China's southern coast, administrated by the Portuguese), [[Guangzhou]] (the capital of [[Guangdong Province]]), [[Nanxiong]] (in northern [[Guangdong province]], between the mountains), [[Nanchang]] (the capital of [[Jiangxi Province]]), [[Jiujiang]] (in northwest [[Jiangxi Province]]), [[Nanjing]], [[Hangzhou]] (the capital of [[Zhejiang Province]]) and [[Shanghai]], traversing the [[Shandong Province]] he reached [[Tianjin]] and [[Beijing]], [[Nanping]] in the [[Fujian Province]], [[Wenzhou]] (in southern [[Zhejiang Province]]), [[Anhai]] (a port in southern [[Fujian]]), [[Manila]] (in the [[Philippines]]), [[Makassar]] ([[Sulawesi]] island in the [[Dutch Indonesia]]), [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]/ [[Jakarta]] ([[Sumatra]] island, capital of the [[Dutch Indonesia]]), [[Cape Town]]/[[Kaapstad]] (a stop of twenty days in the fort, the Dutch Governor [[Jan van Riebeeck]] had built in 1652), [[Bergen]], [[Hamburg]], the Belgian [[Antwerp]] and [[Bruxelles]] where he met the archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, the Dutch [[Leiden]] (with the scholar [[Jacob van Gool]] aka [[Golius]]) and [[Amsterdam]] where he met the famous cartographer [[Joan Blaeu]], almost certainly some cities in France, then [[Monaco di Baviera]], [[Vienna]] and the nearby {{Interlanguage link multi|Kaiserebersdorf Castle|de|3=Schloss Kaiserebersdorf|lt=Hunting Pavilion of Ebersdorf}} (where he met the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] of [[Habsburg]]), and finally Rome. For his last journey (from 11 January 1656 to 17 July 1658) Martini sailed from [[Genoa]], the [[Hyeres]] islands on the [[French Riviera]] (to escape pirates), to Alicante, Lisboa, Goa, the Portuguese colony of [[Larantuka]] in [[Flores|Flores Island]] (Indonesia) resting over a month, Makassar (where he met a Dominican friar, [[Domingo Navarrete]]), Macao, and finally Hangzhou, where he died.

==Post-mortem phenomenon==
[[File:Martinigrave.JPG|thumb|Martini's grave in Hangzhou]]
According to the attestation of Prosper Intorcetta (in ''Litt. Annuae'', 1861), Martini's corpse was found to be undecayed after twenty years.  It became a longstanding object of cult, not only for Christians, until, in 1877, suspecting [[idolatry]], the hierarchy had it reburied.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cczj.org/company.asp?id=195&amp;page=2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern views==
Today's scientists have shown increasing interest in the works of Martini.  He is acclaimed as the father of Chinese geographical science.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}  During an international convention organized in the city of [[Trento]] (his birthplace), a member of the Chinese academy of Social Sciences, Prof. Ma Yong said:  "Martini was the first to study the [[history]] and [[geography]] of China with rigorous scientific objectivity; the extent of his knowledge of the [[Chinese culture]], the accuracy of his investigations, the depth of his understanding of things Chinese are examples for the modern sinologists". [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]] calls Martini "the leading geographer of the Chinese mission, one who was unexcelled and hardly equalled, during the XVIII century&amp;hellip;There was no other missionary, either before or after, who made such diligent use of his time in acquiring information about the country". (China, I, 674 sq.){{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Works==
[[File:Martino-Martini-Regni-Sinensis-a-Tartari-devastati-enarratio.png|thumb|A European artist's impression of a Manchu warrior devastating China, from the title page of Martini's  ''Regni Sinensis a Tartaris devastati enarratio''. Modern historians (e.g. [[Pamela Kyle Crossley]] in ''The Manchu'', or [[D.E. Mungello]]) note the discrepancy between the picture and the content of the book; e.g., the severed head held by the warrior has a queue, which is a Manchu hairstyle (also imposed by Manchu on the population of conquered China), and is not likely to be had by a Ming loyalist]]
*Martini's most important work is ''Novus Atlas Sinensis'', which appeared as part of volume 10 of [[Joan Blaeu]]'s [[Atlas Maior]] ([[Amsterdam]] 1655). This work, a [[Folio (printing)|folio]] with 17 maps and 171 pages of text was, in the words of the early 20th-century German geographer [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]], ''the most complete geographical description of China that we possess, and through which Martini has become the father of geographical learning on China''. The French Jesuits of the time concurred, saying that even [[Jean-Baptiste Du Halde|du Halde]]'s monumental ''Description&amp;hellip;de la Chine'' did not fully supersede Martini's work.&lt;ref&gt;"Martin Martini" in [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k61546234.r=blaeu+%22atlas+sinensis%22.langEN.swf Notices biographiques et bibliographiques sur les jésuites de l'ancienne mission de Chine (1552-1773)], par le P.

*Of the great chronological work which Martini had planned, and which was to comprise the whole Chinese history from the earliest age, only the first part appeared: ''[http://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ECHOdocuView/ECHOzogiLib?mode=imagepath&amp;url=/mpiwg/online/permanent/library/6R9MRSH6/pageimg Sinicæ Historiæ Decas Prima]'' ([[Munich]] 1658), which reached until the birth of [[Jesus]].
*His ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nhhbAAAAQAAJ De Bello Tartarico Historia]'' ([[Antwerp]] 1654) is also important as Chinese history, for Martini himself had lived through the frightful occurrences which brought about the overthrow of the ancient [[Ming dynasty]]. The works have been repeatedly published and translated into different languages. There is also a later version, entitled ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TlA9AAAAcAAJ Regni Sinensis a Tartaris devastati enarratio]'' (1661); compared to the original ''De Bello Tartarica Historia'', it has some additions, such as an index.
*Interesting as missionary history is his ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=icMAAAAAcAAJ Brevis Relatio de Numero et Qualitate Christianorum apud Sinas]'', ([[Brussels]], 1654).
*Besides these, Martini wrote a series of theological and apologetical works in Chinese, including a ''De Amicitia'' (Hangzhou, 1661) that could have been the first anthology of Western authors available in China (Martini's selection drew mainly from [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] writings).
*Several works, among them a Chinese translation of the works of [[Francisco Suarez]], which has not been found yet.
*''Grammatica Linguae Sinensis'': 1652-1653. The first manuscript grammar of Mandarin Chinese and the first grammar of Chinese language ever printed and published in M.

'''Microecosystems''' can exist in locations which are precisely defined by critical [[Natural environment|environmental]] factors within small or tiny spaces.

Such factors may include [[temperature]], [[pH]], [[chemical]] milieu, [[nutrient]] supply, presence of symbionts or solid substrates, gaseous atmosphere ([[Wikt:aerobic|aerobic]] or [[Wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]]) etc.

==Some examples==
===Pond microecosystems===
These microecosystems with limited [[water]] volume are often only of temporary duration and hence colonized by organisms which possess a drought-resistant [[spore]] stage in the lifecycle, or by organisms which do not need to live in water continuously. The ecosystem conditions appliying at a typical pond edge can be quite different from those further from shore. Extremely space-limited water ecosystems can be found in, for example, the water collected in [[bromeliad]] leaf bases and the "pitchers" of ''[[Nepenthes]]''.

===Soil microecosystems===
A typical soil microecosystem may be restricted to less than a millimeter in its total depth range owing to steep variation in humidity and/or atmospheric gas composition. The soil grain size and physical and chemical properties of the substrate may also play important roles. Because of the predominant solid phase in these systems they are notoriously difficult to study microscopically without simultaneously disrupting the fine spatial distribution of their components.

===Terrestrial hot-spring microecosystems===
These are defined by gradients of water temperature, nutrients, dissolved gases, [[salt]] concentrations etc. Along the path of terrestrial water flow the resulting temperature gradient continuum alone may provide many different minute microecosystems, starting with thermophilic bacteria such as [[Archaea]] "Archaebacteria" (100+ °C), followed by conventional [[thermophiles]] (60–100 °C), [[cyanobacteria]] (blue-green algae) such as the motile filaments of ''Oscillatoria'' (30–60 °C), [[protozoa]] such as Amoeba, [[rotifers]], then [[green algae]] (0–30 °C) etc.
Of course other factors than temperature also play important roles. Hot springs can provide classic and straightforward ecosystems for microecology studies as well as providing a haven for hitherto undescribed organisms.

===Deep-sea microecosystems===
The best known contain rare specialized organisms, found only in the immediate vicinity (sometimes within centimeters) of underwater [[volcanic vent]]s (or "smokers"). These ecosystems require extremely advanced diving and collection techniques for their scientific exploration.

===Closed microecosystem===
One that is sealed and completely independent of outside factors, except for temperature and light. A good example would be a plant contained in a sealed jar and submerged under water. No new factors would be able to enter this ecosystem.

[[Image:NobskaLight.jpg|thumb|right|A [[lighthouse]] is an easily recognized aid to navigation.]]
A '''navigational aid''' (also known as '''aid to navigation,''' '''ATON,''' or '''navaid''') is any sort of marker which aids the traveler in [[navigation]], usually nautical or aviation travel.  Common types of such aids include [[lighthouse]]s, [[buoy]]s, [[fog signal]]s, and [[day beacon]]s.

==Definition==
According to the glossary of terms in the [[Light List|United States Coast Guard Light list]], an Aid to Navigation (ATON) is any device external to a vessel or aircraft specifically intended to assist navigators in determining their position or safe course, or to warn them of dangers or obstructions to navigation.

=={{anchor|Lateral marker}} Lateral markers==
Red ATONs always have even numbers, and green ATONs have odd numbers.  Under the [[International Association of Lighthouse Authorities|IALA B]] standard used in North and South America, when you are going to sea, the red ATON is on your left, and the green on your right. Under the [[International Association of Lighthouse Authorities|IALA A]] standard used in Europe, Africa and most of Asia, the colors are reversed.

In the IALA B system, the red ATONs are on your right when you return from sea (Red Right Returning) and the green on your left. Red daybeacons are triangles and green daybeacons are squares. All of these ATONs are Lateral Markers that mark traffic channels and where it is safe to travel.

==Cardinal marks==
For waters where the direction of the related fairway is not obvious, such as where there are fairways leading in several directions or where there is navigable water outside designated fairways, [[cardinal mark]]s are often used instead of lateral ones. These give the direction of safe water as a cardinal direction (north, east, south or west) relative to the mark.

==Other markers==
[[Image:ATON_-_Road_Signs_of_the_Waterway.png|thumb|right|Diagram showing lateral, non-lateral, and special purpose markers as seen on a [[Lateral mark|IALA Region B]] [[nautical chart]].]]There are also other markers that give information other than the edges of safe waters. Most are white with orange markings and black lettering. They are used to give direction and information, warn of hazards and destructions, mark controlled areas, and mark off-limits areas. These ATONs do not mark traffic channels.

On non-lateral markers, there are some shapes that show certain things:
 	
;Squares: show information, including places to find food, supplies, and repairs. They sometimes show directions.
;Diamonds: warn about dangers like rocks, construction, dams, or stumps.
;Circles: mark a controlled area such as no wake, idles speed, speed limit, or ski zone.
;Crossed diamonds: show areas off limits to all boats, like swimming areas and dams.

==Junction buoys==
There are some special colored ATONs. When there are red and green horizontal stripes, you are at the junction of two channels. The ATONs indicate the primary channel. If the green is on the top, the preferred channel is to the right. If the red is on top, the preferred channel is to the left. The light matches the top stripe color. These ATONs are sometimes called "junction buoys".

==AIS ATONs==

ATONs are often integrated with [[Automatic Identification System|Automatic Identification System (AIS)]], e.g. a lighthouse can be equipped with an AIS transmitter. Sometimes it is impractical to equip the ATON with an AIS transponder; in this case an AIS shore station can be assigned to transmit AIS messages on behalf of the ATON. This is known as a ''synthetic ATON''.

In other cases, such as marking a wreck until a physical buoy can be deployed, a so-called ''virtual ATON'' is created: A shore-based AIS system is configured to transmit AIS messages indicating the existence of an ATON at a specified location.

==Lead marks and lights==
[[Image:Navigation_leading_markers_and_lights.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Triangle shaped lead marks with lights.]]
[[Range lights|Lead marks]] (as in "leading a ship into a safe place") and lights are fixed markers that are laterally displaced to allow a mariner to navigate a fixed channel along the preferred route.  They are also known as "channel markers".&lt;ref name="keys'"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://keysnews.com/node/21481 |date=March 10, 2010 |title=Channel marker proposal upsets anglers |first1=Robert |last1=Silk |location=[[Key West, Florida]] |publisher=[[Key West Citizen|The Citizen]] |work=keysnews.com |accessdate=December 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713145359/http://keysnews.com/node/21481 |archivedate=July 13, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They can normally be used coming into and out of the channel. When lit, they are also usable at night. Customarily, the upper mark is up-hill from the lower (forward) mark. The mariner will know the geometry of the marks/lights from the [[navigational chart]] and can understand that when "open" (not one above the other) the ship needs to be navigated to "close" the marks (so one is above the other) and be in the preferred line of the channel.

In some cases, the lead marks/lights are provided by lasers, as in the [[Tasman Bridge#Reconstruction|laser channel]] under the [[Tasman Bridge]] on the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|Derwent River]] at [[Hobart, Tasmania|Hobart]], [[Tasmania]].

'''Opis''' ([[Akkadian (language)|Akkadian]] ''Upî'' or ''Upija''; {{lang-grc|Ὦπις}}) was an ancient [[Babylonia]]n city near the [[Tigris]], not far from modern [[Baghdad]]. [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] texts indicate that it was located on the east side of the Tigris, near the [[Diyala River]].  While the precise site of the city has been considered uncertain for a long time, recent geographical surveys of ancient Mesopotamia identify Opis with great probability as the mound called Tall al-Mujailāt (or Tulūl al-Mujaili`), {{Convert|20|miles}} southeast in a straight line from central Baghdad and {{Convert|47|miles}} northeast in a straight line from ancient [[Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Högelmann and Buschmann (1986); Parpola and Porter (2001) map 32, glossary p. 18; Talbert (2000) map 91 F4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Opis is mentioned for the first time at the beginning of [[second millennium BC]]. In the 14th century BC, it became the capital of an administrative region in Babylonia.

The Babylonians dug the "royal canal" between the [[Euphrates]] and the Tigris, which ended near Opis. The Babylonian king [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] (605–562 BC) built a long [[Median Wall|wall]] between the two rivers to protect against a potential [[Medes|Median]] invasion; the fortified line continued eastward beyond the Tigris and ended near Opis.&lt;ref&gt;For the courses of the canal and the Median Wall, see Talbert (2000) map 91 F4.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Persian Conquest

In October 539 BC, the troops of the Babylonian king [[Nabonidus]] (556–539 BC) defended Opis against the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] commanded by [[Cyrus the Great]] (559–530 BC). The Babylonians were defeated and the native population revolted against its government. Without further fighting, Cyrus captured Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;Olmstead (1948) 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Opis was located near the Persian [[Royal Road]], which connected the former [[Elam]]ite capital [[Susa]] to the [[Assyria]]n heartland around [[Erbil]] and, further to the west, the [[Lydia]]n capital [[Sardis]].

;Macedonian Conquest

In September 331 BC, the [[Macedon]]ian king [[Alexander the Great]] (336–323 BC) defeated [[Darius III of Persia]] (336–330 BC) at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]], and probably took possession of Opis about the same time as Babylon. A few years later, Alexander was forced by a mutiny at the [[Beas River|Hyphasis]] (now Beas) River to return from the long campaign in India, and his European troops revolted again at Opis (autumn 324 BC). In an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects, he took an oath of unity before 9,000 Persian and Greek troops at Opis.  In a similar vein, he had married [[Stateira II|Stateira]] (the daughter of Darius) and celebrated a mass marriage of his senior officers to Persian and other Eastern noblewomen at Susa just before coming to Opis.

;Hellenic Rule

[[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleukos I Nikator]] (306–281 BC), one of Alexander's [[Diadochi]] (Successors), founded the [[Seleucid Empire]] and built his Mesopotamian capital [[Seleucia on the Tigris|Seleukeia]] west of the river Tigris, some {{Convert|12|miles}} southwest of Opis.  The [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] city of Seleukeia rapidly eclipsed older Mesopotamian centers in the region like Babylon, [[Sippar]], and Opis.

In the 2nd century BC, the [[Parthian Empire]] conquered the eastern provinces of the Seleucid Empire, including Seleukeia and Opis. Both cities were, in their turn, largely eclipsed by the emergence of the new Parthian (and subsequently [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]]) capital [[Ktesiphon]] nearby, in-between Seleukeia and Opis.

'''Particulate pollution''' is [[pollution]] of an [[Biophysical environment|environment]] that consists of [[particle]]s suspended in some medium. There are three primary forms: [[atmospheric particulate matter]],&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[marine debris]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and [[space debris]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Some particles are released directly from a specific source, while others form in [[Chemical reaction|chemical reactions]] in the atmosphere. Particulate pollution can be derived from either natural sources or [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] processes.

==Atmospheric particulate matter==
[[Particulates|Atmospheric particulate matter]], also known as [[particulate matter]], or PM, describes solids and/or liquid particles suspended in a gas, most commonly the [[Earth]]'s atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perrino|first=Cinzia|date=2010|title=Atmospheric particulate matter|url=https://laboratoriocritico.uniroma1.it/index.php/CISB-BBL/article/view/8876|journal=Biophysics and Bioengineering Letters|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|issn=2037-0199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particles in the atmosphere can be divided into two types, depending on the way they are emitted. Primary particles, such as [[mineral dust]], are emitted into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giere|first=R.|last2=Querol|first2=X.|date=2010|title=Solid Particulate Matter in the Atmosphere|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/msa/elements/article-standard/6/4/215/137857/solid-particulate-matter-in-the-atmosphere|journal=Elements|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=215–222|doi=10.2113/gselements.6.4.215|issn=1811-5209|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary particles, such as [[ammonium nitrate]], are formed in the atmosphere through gas-to-particle conversion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Marine debris==
Marine debris and marine aerosols refer to particulates [[Suspended load|suspended in a liquid]], usually water on the Earth's surface. Particulates in water are a kind of water pollution measured as total [[suspended solids]], a [[water quality]] measurement listed as a [[conventional pollutant]] in the U.S. [[Clean Water Act]], a [[water quality law]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. [[Clean Water Act]], sec. 304(a)(4), [[Title 33 of the United States Code|33 U.S.C.]] § 1314(a)(4).&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, some of the same kinds of particles can be suspended both in air and water, and pollutants specifically may be carried in the air and deposited in water, or fall to the ground as [[acid rain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm|title=Health and Environmental Effects of Particulate Matter (PM) {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OAR|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of marine aerosols are created through the bubble bursting of breaking waves and capillary action on the ocean surface due to the stress exerted from surface winds.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuzzi|first=S.|last2=Baltensperger|first2=U.|last3=Carslaw|first3=K.|last4=Decesari|first4=S.|last5=Denier van der Gon|first5=H.|last6=Facchini|first6=M.

==Space debris==
[[Space debris]] describes particulates in the [[vacuum]] of [[outer space]], specifically particles originating from human activity that remain in [[geocentric orbit]] around the [[Earth]]. The International Association of Astronauts define space debris as "any man-made Earth orbiting object which is non-functional with no reasonable expectation of assuming or resuming its intended function or any other function for which it is or can be expected to be authorized, including fragments and parts thereof".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chaddha|first=Shane|date=2010|title=Space Debris Mitigation|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1586539|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|language=en|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1586539|issn=1556-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Space debris]] is classified by size and operational purpose, and divided into four main subsets: inactive payloads, operational debris, fragmentation debris and microparticulate matter.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Inactive payloads refer to any launched space objects that have lost the capability to reconnect to its corresponding space operator; thus, preventing a return to Earth.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Space Debris: Legal and Policy Implications|last=Baker|first=H.A.|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|year=1989|isbn=0-7923-0166-8|location=Dordrecht, The Netherlands|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, operational debris describes the matter associated with the propulsion of a larger entity into space, which may include upper rocket stages and ejected nose cones.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Fragmentation debris refers to any object in space that has become dissociated from a larger entity by means of [[explosion]], [[collision]] or [[Wear|deterioration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Orbital Debris: A Technical Assessment|last=Committee on Space Debris, National Research Council|first=|publisher=National Academies Press|year=1995|isbn=0309051258|location=|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microparticulate matter describes space matter that typically cannot be seen singly with the naked eye, including particles, gases, and spaceglow.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In response to research that concluded that impacts from Earth orbital debris could lead to greater hazards to spacecraft than the natural meteoroid environment, [[NASA]] began the orbital debris program in 1979, initiated by the Space Sciences branch at [[Johnson Space Center]] (JSC).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Limiting Future Collision Risk to Spacecraft: An Assessment of NASA's Meteoroid and Orbital Debris Programs|last=|first=|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2011|isbn=0309219779|location=Washington|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with an initial budget of $70,000, the NASA orbital debris program began with the initial goals of characterizing hazards induced by space debris and creating mitigation standards that would minimize the growth of the orbital debris environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Orbital Debris: A Chronology|last=D.S.F. Portree|first=J.P. Loftus|publisher=NASA|year=1999|isbn=|location=Washington|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990, the NASA orbital debris program created a debris monitoring program, which included mechanisms to sample the [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) environment for debris as small as 6mm using the [[Haystack Observatory|Haystack X-band]] ground radar.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The brothers were sailors along the coast of Huelva, and thanks to their many commercial voyages and piracy along the coast, they were famous along the entire coast.&lt;ref name = "juliobreve"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://es.geocities.com/julioil/breve.htm|title = Breve historia de Palos de la Frontera|accessdate = 2008-10-03|author = Izquierdo Labrado, Julio|authorlink = Julio Izquierdo Labrado|year = 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227025859/http://es.geocities.com/julioil/breve.htm|archivedate=2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategic position offered by the historic [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] port of Palos, from which expeditions had set forth to the [[Africa]]n coasts&lt;ref name = "decadas1"&gt;[[Alfonso de Palencia|de Palencia, Alfonso]].

Martín Alonso and Vicente Yáñez, captains of the [[caravel]]s ''[[Pinta (ship)|La Pinta]]'' and ''[[Niña|La Niña]]'', respectively on Columbus's first voyage, are the best known of the brothers, but the third brother, the lesser-known Francisco Martín, was aboard the ''Pinta'' as its master.

It was thanks to Martín Alonso that the seamen of the [[Río Tinto (river)|Tinto]]-[[Odiel]] were motivated to participate in Columbus's undertaking.&lt;ref name = "ortegamartin"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ortega|1980|loc=Tomo III, p. 37-110}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also supported the project economically, supplying money from his personal fortune.&lt;ref name = "LascasasPinzón"&gt;{{cite book |last= de las Casas|first= Bartolomé|authorlink= Bartolomé de Las Casas|title= Historia de las Indias| url = http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/12033856617830495876213/index.htm|accessdate= 2008-10-18|chapter= Tomo I.

Francisco, master of the ''Pinta'', appears to have participated in Columbus's [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third]] and [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Fourth voyage|fourth]] voyages of discovery as well as in the first, but because his name was a common one, the facts of his life cannot be easily sorted out from those of contemporaries with the same name.&lt;ref name = "ortegafrancisco"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ortega|1980|loc=Tomo III, págs. 135-137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "listafrancisco"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gould|1984|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3YktZjeEVnYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA132,M1 p. 132 ''et. seq.'']}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they sometimes quarreled with Columbus, on several occasions the Pinzón brothers were instrumental in preventing [[mutiny]] against him, particularly during the first voyage. On 6 October, Martín intervened in a dispute between Columbus and the crew by proposing an altered course (which Columbus eventually accepted) and thus calmed simmering unrest. A few days later, on the night of 9 October 1492, the brothers were forced to intercede once again, and this time they proposed the compromise that if no land was sighted during the next three days, the expedition would return to Spain.&lt;ref name=Basq&gt;José Manuel Azcona Pastor, ''Possible paradises: Basque emigration to Latin America'', University of Nevada Press, 2004, pg. 14, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eiqFIaY0LpEC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=Pinzón+Brothers+proposed&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of the 12th, land (there is some question of the location: ''see [[Guanahani]]'') was in fact sighted by [[Juan Rodriguez Bermejo]] (also known as [[Rodrigo de Triana]]).&lt;ref name=Basq/&gt;

== The port of Palos at the end of the 15th century ==
The Pinzón brothers lived in the era of the greatest splendor of the port town of Palos de la Frontera, participating in the majority of the activities undertaken by that port.

The historic port of Palos was a river port, protected from winds and from pirate attacks, both major hazards to the ports of the time. It was located on the lower portion of the [[Río Tinto (river)|Río Tinto]] known then as the Canal de Palos, about {{convert|4|km|mi}} from its mouth at the Atlantic and its confluence with the [[Odiel]]. The port probably grew simultaneously with the town, first as an anchorage for small vessels engaged almost exclusively in fishing on the beaches and estuaries and occasional commercial transactions to supply the small population.&lt;ref name = "PalosJulio"&gt;{{cite web|author=Izquierdo Labrado, Julio|url=http://mgar.net/var/algarve.htm|title=Relaciones de Palos de la Frontera con el Algarve a finales del siglo XV|publisher=mgar.net|year=1993|accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MapatoograficoHuelvasiglo18.jpg|thumb|18th century [[topographic map]], showing the location of the old port of [[Palos de la Frontera|Palos]].]]
For many, the expression ''port of Palos'' brings to mind the present-day port with its old wharf, the ''muelle de la Calzadilla'' from which the ''[[Plus Ultra (flying boat)|Plus Ultra]]'' [[flying boat]] departed in 1926 to cross the Atlantic. This is not the 15th century port. The municipal ordinances of the era (''Ordenanzas Municipales de Palos (1484–1521)''), focused mainly on regulating the town's maritime activities never use the terms ''puerto'' (port) or ''muelle'' (wharf). The caravels of Palos "arrived at the riverbank" (''"aportaban a la ribera"''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ladero Quesada, Miguel Ángel|authorlink=Miguel Ángel Ladero Quesada|date=Jul–Dec 1978|title=Palos en vísperas del Descubrimiento|publisher=Revista de Indias|number=153-154|page=477}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they discharged their goods and auctioned their fish. That is to say, the activities of the port were not conducted in any single place, but along the length of the bank of the Río Tinto, because of the large number of ships and relatively high volume of merchandise they had to handle.&lt;ref name="duquesapalos"&gt;{{Harvnb|Álvarez de Toledo|2000|loc=[http://americaversus.iespana.es/4parte/1palosma/cen.htm Cap. «El Palos del Descubrimiento.»]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Progressively, the river became Palos's principal means of connection to the outside world and the port the axis of its relation to the surrounding towns. This maritime orientation modified the shape of the town, previously a conical area centered around the church and castle. The Calle de la Ribera ("Riverbank Street") connecting the town center to the port became the town's principal artery, and the port the authentic heart of the local economy.&lt;ref name = "PalosJulio" /&gt;

On the eve of Columbus's first voyage, the entire riverbank between the present-day wharfs near the center of Palos and {{convert|3|km|mi}} away at [[La Rábida Monastery]] was an active port. The caravels anchored in the center of the river, where the depth was sufficient for their drafts, and paid for the rights to anchor there. From the caravels, boats and dinghies loaded or unloaded the goods "tying up to the shore" (''"amarrando en la ribera"'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Julio Izquierdo Labrado]]. ''Palos de la Frontera en el Antiguo Régimen (1380-1830).'' Huelva, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The port had a population density similar to that to the town proper, from what we can deduce from the ''Ordenanza Municipal'', which prohibited weapons on the riverbank because the people there were as tightly packed as in the town proper (the expression used is ''"tan aparejadas como en la Villa"'': ''aparejadas'' is nautical Spanish for something that has been furnished or supplied).&lt;ref&gt;González Gómez, Antonio. «Las Ordenanzas Municipales de Palos de la Frontera (1484-1521).» ''[http://departamento.us.es/dhmcthus/hid1.htm#N%C3%BAmero%203 Historia. Instituciones. Documentos. Número 3.]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'' University of Sevilla, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the first third of the 15th century, the port of Palos experienced continual economic growth, obtaining an importance well beyond the local area and achieving even international dimensions, as is testified by the frequent presence of [[England|English]], [[Brittany|Breton]], [[Flanders|Flemish]], and [[Italy|Italian]] ships.

Following in the wake of the Portuguese, the ships of Palos traveled to the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]], with their rich fisheries and the commercial possibility of trade in gold, spices, and slaves. In the second half of the 15th century, Palos reaches a population of three thousand. The ''alota'' of Palos, a type of customs warehouse, paid the largest tribute of any such facility to the [[Dukes of Medina Sidonia|Duke of Medina Sidonia]], its primacy being such that it fishermen were recruited from other towns along the coast and two residents of Palos. Juan Venegas and Pedro Alonso Cansino, were placed in charge of giving licenses to fish in the Afro-Atlantic waters from [[Cabo Bojador]] to the [[Río de Oro]], which they leased from the [[Catholic Monarchs]] [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Archivo General de Simancas]], Registro General del Sello, 1491-VIII, fol. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Pinzón family of Palos ==
The Pinzón family were one of the leading families of 14th-century Palos. The family may have come originally from the [[Kingdom of Aragón]], but arrived in [[Andalusia]] either from ''la Montaña'' (now [[Cantabria]]) or from [[Asturias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gould, Alice B.|year=1927|title=Documentos inéditos sobre la hidalguía y genealogía de la familia Pinzón|publisher=Boletín de la Real Academia de la Historia,|volume=tomo 91|location=Madrid|page=319}}&lt;br /&gt;Cited in:
* {{Harvnb|Manzano Manzano|Manzano Fernández-Heredia|1988|loc=Vol. I. p. 5.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some historians, this surname could have been a corruption of ''Espinzas'' or ''Pinzas'' ("tweezers"). Others say that the true family name was ''Martín'', a widespread name with a long tradition in the area,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ortega|1980|Tomo III, p. 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the name of their grandfather, a sailor and diver in Palos, who was dubbed ''Pinzón'' when he went blind; that, combined with his hobby of singing gave him the nickname ''Pinzón'', the Spanish word for ''[[Fringilla coelebs|chaffinch]]'', because owners of chaffinches sometimes blinded them, supposedly making them sing more beautifully.&lt;ref name = "juliobreve"/&gt; His son, also a sailor named Martín Pinzón, was the father of the three Pinzón brothers. Their mother was named Mayor Vicente,&lt;ref&gt;Archivo General de Simancas, Registro General del Sello, March 1505.

{{main|Martín Alonso Pinzón}}
Martín Alonso Pinzón (c. 1441 – c. 31 March 1493) was the oldest of the brothers, and captain of the ''Pinta'' on Columbus's first voyage.

For Martín Alonso the return voyage was lethal, as the ships suffered from a great storm, which resulted in great fatigue and exhaustion, accumulated over many days of sailing. Because of this, Martín's recurrent fevers from which he suffered reactivated and he died a few days after returning from the New World.&lt;ref name = "JulioPinzón"/&gt; In fact, he was taken from his ship in a stretcher and, as Columbus arrived, his friends took him to a farm that was on the boundary between Palos and Moguer.

=== Francisco Martín Pinzón ===
Francisco Martín Pinzón (c. 1445 – c. 1502)&lt;ref group="N."&gt;Fernández-Carrión says Francisco Martín Pinzón was born ''entre 1445 y 1450'' and that Rodrigo Álvarez testified in 1514 in the ''Pleitos Colombinos'' that he had died in 1502.&lt;/ref&gt; was the second of the brothers. On Columbus's first voyage he was the master (second only to the captain) of the ''Pinta'', the first ship to sight land in the Americas. Although he was less known than his two brothers, he played a major role both in voyages of discovery and in service to the Crown.&lt;ref name="Fernández-Carrión"&gt;Fernández-Carrión, Miguel-Héctor, [http://www.americanistas.es/biblo/textos/c12/c12-026.pdf Biografía de Francisco Martín Pinzón] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720133414/http://www.americanistas.es/biblo/textos/c12/c12-026.pdf |date=20 July 2011 }}, Biblioteca Digital de la Asociación Española de Americanistas. This is an expanded version of a biography for the ''[[Diccionario Biográfico Español]]'' published by the Real Academia de Historia de España. Accessed online 2010-01-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

His personal and family story is confused, because several relatives shared this same name, frequently leading historians to confuse them. Nonetheless, he seems to have been married to Juana Martín and to have had at least one daughter, who we find documented as "an orphan" and "poor" (''"huérfana y pobre"'').&lt;ref name="Fernández-Carrión" /&gt;

With his brother Vicente, he made several voyages to Italy and Africa in service to the Crown. In November 1493, together with Juan de Sevilla, Rodrigo de Quexo, and Fernando Quintero, he led an assault on the [[Algeria]]n coast. In 1496 he brought money and supplies to the Spanish troops fighting in [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]]. Later, he participated in Columbus's third and fourth voyages, on the last of which, according to his companion on many voyages, Rodrigo Álvarez, he died by drowning.&lt;ref name="Fernández-Carrión" /&gt;

=== Vicente Yáñez Pinzón ===
{{main|Vicente Yáñez Pinzón}}
Vicente Yáñez Pinzón (c. 1462 – c. September 1514) was the youngest brother. He was captain of the ''Niña'' on the first voyage of discovery. He later made other discoveries on his own account; historians consider him the discoverer of [[Brazil]] along with his cousin [[Diego de Lepe]] .&lt;ref name="Soler Pascual"&gt;Emilio Soler Pascual, [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/historia/viajeros/viajeros2_vicentepinzon.shtml Exploradores y viajeros por España: 1492, Vicente Yáñez Pinzón] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212045856/http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/historia/viajeros/viajeros2_vicentepinzon.shtml |date=12 February 2008 }}, Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes. Of Brazil, Soler Pascual concludes ''"Pinzón, con toda seguridad, había descubierto tierra brasileña meses antes de que lo hiciera el portugués Alvares Cabral, en abril de 1500."'': "Pinzón, in all certainty, had discovered Brazilian territory months before the same was done by the Portuguese [[Pedro Álvares Cabral|Alvares Cabral]] in April 1500."&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerably younger than his brothers, it is likely that his name ''Yáñez'' came from Rodrigo Yáñez, a bailiff (''alguacil'') of Palos who would then have been his godfather, according to the custom of the place.&lt;ref name = "ortegavicente1" /&gt; Tradition in Palos indicates that he lived on the Calle de la Ribera. From a young age, he learned the art of navigation from his oldest brother, and from adolescence he participated in combat and in military assaults, as he happened to reach this age during the War of the Castilian Succession.

He married twice, first to Teresa Rodríguez, with whom he had two daughters, Ana Rodríguez and Juana González. After his final return from the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] in 1509 he married Ana Núñez de Trujillo, with whom he lived in [[Triana, Seville|Triana]] (across the river from [[Seville]]), probably until his death.&lt;ref name=Gil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gil|first=Juan|title=Sobre la Vida Familiar de Vicente Yáñez Pinzón|journal=Revista de Indias|volume=XLVII|number=181|date=September–December 1987|pages=645:754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vicente immediately supported his brother, Martín Alonso, when Martin decided to back Columbus's undertaking. The two worked together to enlist men from the Tinto-Odiel for the risky voyage.&lt;ref name = "ortegavicente1" /&gt; He was chosen as captain of the ''Niña'' and distinguished himself during the voyage. This involved, among other accomplishments, helping to put down several attempts at mutiny together with his older brother. He provided support, both to Columbus and the rest of the crew, after the ''Santa María'' was wrecked. With his flagship gone, the admiral made his return voyage in the ''Niña'', captained by Vicente, who provided all the help necessary for a successful return voyage.

He made several more expeditions to the Americas, the most important being the voyage to the mouth of the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] which constituted the discovery of [[Brazil]], in early 1500.&lt;ref name=exp&gt;Marshall Cavendish Corporation, "Explorers and Exploration, Volume 7", pg. 551, [https://books.google.com/books?id=b4abpp9ZJrEC&amp;pg=PA551&amp;dq=Vicente+Y%C3%A1%C3%B1ez+Pinz%C3%B3n&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; That expedition was an economic failure.&lt;ref name=Gil /&gt; In 1505 he was made the governor of [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name=exp /&gt; Later, in 1506, he returned to the [[Caribbean]] to search for a passage to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. He explored all of the Caribbean coast of [[Central America]] and the [[Yucatan Peninsula]].&lt;ref name = "vicentejulio" /&gt;

According to the chronicler [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés]], Vicente Yáñez died in 1514, probably at the end of September. It is not known precisely where he is buried, but Oviedo states that it is somewhere in the cemetery of Triana.&lt;ref name = "vicentejulio" /&gt;

== The Pinzón brothers and the discovery of America ==

The participation of the Pinzón brothers was crucial to Columbus's first voyage, especially in that few were disposed to enlist with Columbus until Martín Alonso, a wealthy and famous shipbuilder in the Tinto-Odiel region, gave his support to the enterprise.&lt;ref name = "pinzonDURO"/&gt; Once Martín Alonso gave his support, he undertook a veritable campaign on behalf of the undertaking. His support and that of his brothers and of other distinguished families of mariners in the region served to recruit the necessary crew: sailors from Palos, Huelva, and even from beyond Andalusia. The testimony in the ''pleitos colombinos'' indicates that the Pinzón brothers, above all Martín:

During the voyage of discovery, they demonstrated on several occasions their gifts as expert mariners and as leaders, in that they knew how to master the most diverse and difficult situations. For example, they were able to continue sailing, even after the damage that occurred to the ''Pinta'' when the tiller broke, before they reached the Canary Islands,&lt;ref group="N."&gt;''Ship's Diary'':{{quote|Monday, 6 August [1492]&lt;br /&gt;
The tiller of the caravel Pinta, [the caravel] where Martín Alonso Pinzón was, snapped or was put out of joint, of which the work of one Gómez Rascón and [[Cristóbal Quintero]], who owned the caravel, was believed and suspected, because they regretted going on this voyage and the Admiral said that before leaving there had been a certain amount of hesitation and hubbub about them. Seeing it there, the Admiral was quite perturbed not to be able to help that caravel without danger to his own, but that he was a bit less worried knowing that Martín Alonso Pinzón was a vigorous and ingenious person. Finally, they went between day and night twenty-nine [[league (unit)|leagues]]. During the crossing, he showed his abilities as a sailor when he resolved the problem of the broken tiller of the Pinta and was able to continue sailing.''}}{{quote|Lunes, 6 de agosto&lt;br /&gt;

For these and other acts, the Pinzón brothers have a very notable place in the history of the discovery of America, and are considered by historians as "co-discoverers of America",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Manzano Manzano|Manzano Fernández-Heredia|1988|loc=Vol. III. p. 5}}, {{Harvnb|Arranz Márquez|2004|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YerxcpDT_vsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA208,M1 p. 208]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that without their help, support, and courage, Columbus probably could not have achieved his enterprise of discovery, at least not in that time and place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gould|1984|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3YktZjeEVnYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA93,M1 p. 93]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other voyages ==
Although the oldest of the Pinzón brothers, Martín Alonso, died a few days after returning from Columbus's first voyage, that was by no means the end of the participation of the Pinzóns in voyages of discovery and other sea journeys.

Francisco and Vicente made various voyages to Italy and Africa in service to the Crown. As mentioned [[#Francisco Martín Pinzón|above]], in November 1493, Francisco, along with Juan de Sevilla, Rodrigo de Quexo, and Fernando Quintero, led an assault on the Algerian coast. In 1496 they brought money and supplies to the Spanish troops fighting in Naples. In 1498 he participated in Columbus's third voyage, in which for the first time the Admiral arrived on the continent of [[South America]].

Later in 1498, the Crown decided to end Columbus's monopoly on voyages of discovery. The series of voyages by other mariners are generally known as the "minor voyages" or the "Andalusian voyages" of discovery. After contracting with the crown, on 19 November 1499 Vicente left the port of Palos with four small caravels, crewed largely by his relatives and friends, among them his brother Francisco and also the famous physician of Palos [[Garcí Fernández]], an early supporter of Columbus's first voyage. On this voyage, they discovered Brazil and the Amazon River.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author= dialnet.unirioja.es

On 5 September 1501 the Crown signed an agreement with Vicente in which, among other things, he was named Captain and Governor of the Cabo de Santa María de la Consolación, later [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Izquierdo Labrado |first=Julio |title=Capitulación otorgada a Vicente Yáñez Pinzón |publisher=Transcription of the original. |url=http://es.geocities.com/julioil/vypcap.html |accessdate=2007-12-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027022556/http://es.geocities.com/julioil/vypcap.html |archivedate=27 October 2009 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1502, Francisco traveled with Columbus on his fourth and final voyage; it is on this voyage he is believed to have died by drowning.

Vicente continued to travel back and forth across the Atlantic to fulfill his obligations as Captain General and Governor. He also participated as one of the experts brought together by the Crown in the ''Junta de Navegantes'' in Burgos in 1508 to take up anew the subject of the search for a passage to the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. On his final voyage, along with captain [[Juan Díaz de Solís]], he followed the coasts of [[Gulf of Darién|Darién]], [[Veragua]] and the [[Gulf of Paria]], now [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Panama]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]] and [[Guatemala]]. Not finding the desired passage, he rounded the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] and entered into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the extent of 23.5º north latitude, bringing about one of the first European contacts with the [[Aztec]] civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Upon returning from this voyage, Vicente Yáñez married for the second time and settled in Triana. In 1513 he testified against Columbus in the ''pleitos colombinos''. In 1514 he was ordered to accompany [[Pedrarias Dávila]] to Darién, but he was not well enough and begged to be excused. That was on 14 March 1514, and it is the last primary source document in which he is mentioned.

== Coat of arms granted by Charles I of Spain ==
In 1519 a petition to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]], headed by [[Juan Rodríguez Mafra]], requested the grant of a [[coat of arms]] to the Pinzóns and other mariners of Palos, exposing the lamentable situation of the descendants of those mariners who had offered such service to the Crown. The king finally conceded to the Pinzóns, their descendants and family members a coat of arms consisting of a shield with three caravels, natural, on the sea; from each a hand points to an island representing the first land discovered in the New World. Around that, a border with anchors and crowns.&lt;ref group="N."&gt;[[Archivo General de Indias]] Sección Indiferente General. Signatura: INDIFERENTE,420,L.8,F.146R-147V. {{quote|''Royal Provision of King Don Carlos conceded to Juan Rodríguez Mafra, pilot, Gómez Muñoz, chaplain, Diego Martín Pinzón, Alvaro Alonso, notaries, Juan Pinzón and Alonso González, residents and naturals of the town of Palos, the mercy of the power to use a coat of arms with three caravels, from each of them a hand reaches out, and on the border, some anchors and some crowns, doing to them said mercy in reward for the services performed in the discovery of the Indies by their respective ancestors: Martín Alonso Pinzón, Vicente Yáñez Pinzón, Andrés González Pinzón, Diego de Lepe, and Miguel Alonso.''}}{{quote|''Real Provisión del Rey D.

The '''Pyrenees''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪr|ᵻ|n|iː|z}}; {{lang-es|Pirineos}} {{IPA-es|piɾiˈneos|}}; {{lang-fr|Pyrénées}} {{IPA-fr|piʁene|}}; {{lang-an|Pirineus}}; {{lang-ca|Pirineus}} {{IPA-ca|piɾiˈnɛws|}}; {{lang-oc|Pirenèus}}; {{lang-eu|Pirinioak}} {{IPA-eu|piˈɾinioˌak|}}) is a [[mountain range|range of mountains]] in southwest [[Europe]] that forms a [[natural border]] between [[Spain]] and [[France]]. Reaching a height of {{convert|3404|m|ft|0}} altitude at the peak of [[Aneto]], the range separates the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the rest of continental Europe, and extends for about {{convert|491|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the [[Bay of Biscay]] ([[Cap Higuer]]) to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] ([[Cap de Creus]]).

For the most part, the main crest forms a divide between Spain and France, with the [[microstate]] of [[Andorra]] sandwiched in between. The [[Principality of Catalonia]] alongside with the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] in the [[Crown of Aragon]], [[Occitania]] and the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] have historically extended on both sides of the mountain range, with smaller northern portions now in France and larger southern parts now in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Preamble of the [http://www.cg66.fr/culture/patrimoine_catalanite/catalanite/charte_catalan.pdf "Charter of the Catalan Language"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325232934/http://www.cg66.fr/culture/patrimoine_catalanite/catalanite/charte_catalan.pdf |date=2009-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1995|title=Collins Road Atlas of Europe|publisher= Harper Collins|location=London|pages= 28–29|isbn= 0-00-448148-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[demonym]] for the noun "Pyrenees" in English is ''Pyrenean''.

==Etymology==
In [[Greek mythology]], [[Pyrene (mythology)|Pyrene]] is a princess who [[eponym|gave her name]] to the Pyrenees. The [[Greek historiography|Greek historian]] [[Herodotus]] says Pyrene is the name of a town in [[Celts|Celtic Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], ''Histories'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.%202.33&amp;lang=original 2.33.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404221340/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.%202.33&amp;lang=original |date=2012-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Silius Italicus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Silius Italicus]], ''Punica'' 3.415–441.&lt;/ref&gt; she was the virgin daughter of [[Bebryx]], a king in [[Narbonensis|Mediterranean Gaul]] by whom the hero [[Hercules]] was given [[hospitality]] during his [[quest]] to steal the cattle of [[Geryon]]&lt;ref&gt;Although [[Geryon]] was usually located in the mythical west of the setting sun, he was also associated with [[Iberia]]; according to [[Strabo]], his triple-body was preserved at [[Cadiz]] in the form of a tree.&lt;/ref&gt; during his famous [[Labours of Hercules|Labors]]. Hercules, characteristically drunk and lustful, violates the sacred code of hospitality and rapes his host's daughter. Pyrene gives birth to a serpent and runs away to the woods, afraid that her father will be angry. Alone, she pours out her story to the trees, attracting the attention of wild beasts who tear her to pieces.

After his victory over Geryon, Hercules passes through the kingdom of Bebryx again, finding the girl's lacerated remains. As is often the case in stories of this hero, the sober Hercules responds with heartbroken grief and remorse at the actions of his darker self, and lays Pyrene to rest tenderly, demanding that the surrounding geography join in mourning and preserve her name:&lt;ref&gt;Ben Tipping, ''Exemplary Epic: Silius Italicus' Punica'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 20–21 [https://books.google.com/books?id=d7asVuCBugAC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=pyrene+geryon&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=pyrene%20geryon&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; "struck by Herculean voice, the mountaintops shudder at the ridges; he kept crying out with a sorrowful noise 'Pyrene!' and all the rock-cliffs and wild-beast haunts echo back 'Pyrene!' … The mountains hold on to the wept-over name through the ages." [[Pliny the Elder]] connects the story of Hercules and Pyrene to [[Lusitania]], but rejects it as ''fabulosa'', highly fictional.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137:book=3:chapter=3&amp;highlight=pyrene 3.3.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014054043/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137:book=3:chapter=3&amp;highlight=pyrene |date=2012-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other classical sources derived the name from the Greek word for fire, {{lang-grc|πῦρ}} (IPA: {{IPA|/pŷːr/}}).&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854) 
William Smith, LLD, Ed.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:entry=pyrenaei-montes-geo]
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] "..in ancient times, we are told, certain herdsmen left a fire and the whole area of the mountains was entirely consumed; and due to this fire, since it raged continuously day after day, the surface of the earth was also burned and the mountains, because of what had taken place, were called the Pyrenees."&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], 'The Library of History' Vol III, 35[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/5B*.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

===Political divisions===
The '''Spanish Pyrenees''' are part of the following [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]], from east to west: [[Girona Province|Girona]], [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona]], [[Lleida Province|Lleida]] (all in [[Catalonia]]), [[Huesca Province|Huesca]] (in [[Aragon]]), [[Navarra]] (in [[Navarre]]) and [[Gipuzkoa]] (in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]).

The '''French Pyrenees''' are part of the following ''[[département in France|département]]s'', from east to west: [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] ([[North Catalonia]] and [[Fenolheda]]), [[Aude]], [[Ariège (department)|Ariège]], [[Haute-Garonne]], [[Hautes-Pyrénées]], and [[Pyrénées-Atlantiques]] (the latter two of which include the [[Pyrenees National Park]]).

The independent principality of [[Andorra]] is sandwiched in the eastern portion of the mountain range between the [[Spanish Pyrenees]] and [[French Pyrenees]].

===Physiographical divisions===
[[File:Monteperdido y Cilindro.jpg|thumb|Monte Perdido, [[Aragon]] (Spain)]] 
[[Physical geography|Physiographically]], the Pyrenees may be divided into three sections: the Atlantic (or Western), the Central, and the Eastern Pyrenees. Together, they form a distinct physiographic province of the larger Alpine System division.

In the Western Pyrenees, from the [[Basque mountains]] near the [[Bay of Biscay]] of the Atlantic Ocean, the average elevation gradually increases from west to east.

The Central Pyrenees extend eastward from the [[Somport]] pass to the [[Aran Valley]], and they include the highest summits of this range:
* [[Pico d'Aneto]] {{convert|3404|m|ft|0}} in the Maladeta ridge,
* [[Pico Posets]] {{convert|3375|m|ft|0}},
* [[Monte Perdido]] {{convert|3355|m|ft|0}}.

In the Eastern Pyrenees, with the exception of one break at the eastern extremity of the ''Pyrénées Ariègeoises'' in the [[Ariège (department)|Ariège]] area, the mean elevation is remarkably uniform until a sudden decline occurs in the easternmost portion of the chain known as the [[Albera Massif|Albères]].

====Foothills====
{{main|Pre-Pyrenees}}
Most [[foothill]]s of the Pyrenees are on the Spanish side, where there is a large and complex system of ranges stretching from Spanish [[Navarre]], across northern Aragon and into Catalonia, almost reaching the [[Mediterranean]] coast with summits reaching {{convert|2600|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www10.gencat.net/probert/catala/prop_lleure/pdf/pirineusprepirineus.pdf Pirineus-Prepirineus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723144756/http://www10.gencat.net/probert/catala/prop_lleure/pdf/pirineusprepirineus.pdf |date=2008-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the eastern end on the southern side lies a distinct area known as the [[Sub-Pyrenees]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordi Sacasas i Lluís, ''Geografía de Catalunya'', Publicacions L'Abadia de Montserrat. {{ISBN|978-84-8415-915-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the French side the slopes of the main range descend abruptly and there are no foothills except in the  [[Corbières Massif]] in the northeastern corner of the mountain system.&lt;ref&gt;Christophe Neff : ''Les Corbières maritimes – forment-elles un étage de végétation méditerranéenne thermophile masqué par la pression humaine ?'' In: Eric Fouache (Edit.): ''The Mediterranean World Environment and History. IAG Working Group on Geo-archeology, Symposium Proceedings. Environmental Dynamics and History in Mediterranean Areas, Paris, Université de Paris – Sorbonne 24 – 26 avril 2002''. Paris, 2003, 191 – 202, (Elsevier France, {{ISBN|2-84299-452-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
{{See also|Geology of the Pyrenees}}

The Pyrenees are older than the [[Alps]]: their [[sediment]]s were first deposited in coastal basins during the [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]] eras.  Between 100 and 150 million years ago, during the Lower [[Cretaceous]] Period, the [[Bay of Biscay]] [[Seafloor spreading|fanned out]], pushing present-day Spain against France and applying intense [[Compression (geology)|compressional pressure]] to large layers of [[sedimentary rock]]. The intense pressure and uplifting of the Earth's crust first affected the eastern part and moved progressively to the entire chain, culminating in the [[Eocene]] Epoch.

The eastern part of the Pyrenees consists largely of [[granite]] and [[gneiss]]ose rocks, while in the western part the granite peaks are flanked by layers of [[limestone]]. The massive and unworn character of the chain comes from its abundance of [[granite]], which is particularly resistant to [[erosion]], as well as weak [[glacier|glacial]] development.

The upper parts of the Pyrenees contain low-relief surfaces forming a [[peneplain]]. This peneplain originated no earlier than in [[Miocene|Late Miocene]] times. Presumably it formed at height as extensive sedimentation raised the local [[base level]] considerably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Babault |first1=Julien |last2=Van Den Driessche |first2=Jean|last3=Bonnet |first3=Stephanie|last4=Castelltort |first4=Sébastien|last5=Crave |first5=Alain |date=2005 |title=Origin of the highly elevated Pyrenean peneplain |url= https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:20401/ATTACHMENT01|journal=Tectonics |volume=24 |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1029/2004TC001697 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landscape==
Conspicuous features of Pyrenean scenery are:
* the absence of great lakes, such as those that fill the lateral valleys of the Alps
* the rarity and relative high elevation of usable [[Mountain pass|passes]]
* the large number of the mountain torrents locally called ''[[Gave (stem)|gaves]]'', which often form lofty [[waterfall]]s, surpassed in Europe only by those of [[Scandinavia]]
* the frequency with which the upper end of a valley assumes the form of a semicircle of precipitous cliffs, called a [[cirque]].

The highest [[waterfall]] is [[Gavarnie Falls|Gavarnie]] (462&amp;nbsp;m or 1,515&amp;nbsp;ft), at the head of the [[Gave de Pau]]; the [[Cirque de Gavarnie]], in the same valley, together with the nearby Cirque de Troumouse and [[Cirque d'Estaubé]], are notable examples of the [[cirque]] formation. 

Low passes are lacking, and the principal roads and the railroads between France and Spain run only in the lowlands at the western and eastern ends of the Pyrenees, near sea level. The main passes of note are:
* the [[Col de la Perche]] (1581m), towards the east, between the valley of the [[Têt River|Têt]] and the valley of the [[river Segre|Segre]], 
* the [[Pas de la Casa|Pas de la Casa or Port d'Envalira]], the highest road pass in the Pyrenees at 2408m, and one of the highest points of the European road network, which provides the route from France to Andorra,
* the nearby [[Col de Puymorens]] (1920m), on [[European route E09]] between France and Spain.
* the [[Port de la Bonaigua]] (2070m), in the middle of the range at the head of the Aran Valley, although the nearly col at Plan de Beret (1870m) is the lowest point in the main ridge between the Col de la Perche, almost 100km to the east and the [[Col du Pourtalet]] (1794m), over 100km to the west.
* the Col de [[Somport]] or Port de Canfranc (1632m), where there were old [[Roman road]]s. 
Because of the lack of low passes a number of tunnels have been created, beneath the passes at Somport, Envalira, and Puymorens and new routes in the center of the range at [[Bielsa]] and [[Vielha Tunnel|Vielha]].

A notable visual feature of this [[mountain range]] is [[La Brèche de Roland]], a gap in the ridge line, which{{spaced ndash}}according to legend{{spaced ndash}}was created by [[Roland]].

==Natural resources==
{{unsourced|section|date=April 2018}}
The metallic [[ore]]s of the Pyrenees are not in general of much importance now, though there were [[iron]] mines at several locations in [[Geography of Andorra#Natural resources|Andorra]], as well as at [[Vicdessos]] in Ariège, and the foot of [[Canigou]] in [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] long ago. [[Coal]] deposits capable of being profitably worked are situated chiefly on the Spanish slopes, but the French side has beds of [[lignite]]. The open pit of Trimoun near the commune of [[Luzenac]] (Ariège) is one of the greatest sources of [[talc]] in Europe.

[[Mineral spring]]s are abundant and remarkable, and especially noteworthy are the [[hot spring]]s. The hot springs, among which those of [[Les Escaldes]] in Andorra, [[Panticosa]] and [[Lles]] in Spain, [[Ax-les-Thermes]], [[Bagnères-de-Luchon]] and [[Eaux-Chaudes]] in France may be mentioned, are [[sulfur]]ous and mostly situated high, near the contact of the granite with the stratified rocks. The lower springs, such as those of [[Bagnères-de-Bigorre]] ([[Hautes-Pyrénées]]), [[Rennes-les-Bains]] ([[Aude]]), and [[Campagne-sur-Aude]] (Aude), are mostly selenitic and not hot.

==Climate==
The amount of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] the range receives, including rain and snow, is much greater in the western than in the eastern Pyrenees because of the moist air that blows in from the Atlantic Ocean over the [[Bay of Biscay]]. After dropping its moisture over the western and central Pyrenees, the air is left dry over the eastern Pyrenees. The winter average temperature is -2&amp;nbsp;°C (28.4&amp;nbsp;°F).

Sections of the mountain range vary in more than one respect. There are some [[glacier]]s in the western and snowy central Pyrenees, but there are no glaciers in the eastern Pyrenees because there is insufficient snowfall to cause their development. Glaciers are confined to the northern slopes of the central Pyrenees, and do not descend, like those of the Alps, far down into the valleys but rather have their greatest lengths along the direction of the mountain chain. They form, in fact, in a narrow zone near the crest of the highest mountains. Here, as in the other great mountain ranges of central Europe, there is substantial evidence of a much wider expanse of glaciation during the [[glacial period]]s.  The best evidence of this is in the valley of Argeles Gazost, between Lourdes and Gavarnie, in the ''{{lang|fr|département}}'' of Hautes-Pyrénées.

The annual snow-line varies in different parts of the Pyrenees from about 2,700 to 2,800 metres above sea level. In average the seasonal snow is observed at least 50% of the time above 1,600 metres between December and April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gascoin|first1=S.|last2=Hagolle|first2=O.|last3=Huc|first3=M.|last4=Jarlan|first4=L.|last5=Dejoux|first5=J.F.|last6=Szczypta|first6=C.|last7=Marti|first7=R.|last8=Sánchez|first8=R.|title=A snow cover climatology for the Pyrenees from MODIS snow products|journal=Hydrology and Earth System Sciences|date=2015|issue=19|pages=2337–2351|doi=10.5194/hess-19-2337-2015|url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/19/2337/2015/hess-19-2337-2015.html|access-date=2015-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529112043/http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/19/2337/2015/hess-19-2337-2015.html|archive-date=2015-05-29|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flora and fauna ==

{{See also|Forests of the Iberian Peninsula#The Eurosiberian region|l1=Forests of the Iberian Peninsula - Eurosiberian region}}

===Flora===
{{Main|:Category:Flora of the Pyrenees}}''
A still more marked effect of the preponderance of rainfall in the western half of the chain is seen in the vegetation. The lower mountains in the extreme west are wooded, but the extent of forest declines as one moves eastwards. The eastern Pyrenees are peculiarly wild and barren, all the more since it is in this part of the chain that granitic masses prevail. Also moving from west to east, there is a change in the composition of the flora, with the change becoming most evident as one passes the centre of the mountain chain from which point the [[Corbières (region)|Corbières]] stretch north-eastwards towards the central plateau of France. Though the difference in latitude is only about 1°, in the west the flora resembles that of central Europe while in the east it is distinctly Mediterranean in character.  The Pyrenees are nearly as rich in [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species as the Alps, and among the most remarkable instances of that [[endemism]] is the occurrence of the monotypic genus ''Xatardia'' (family [[Apiaceae]]), which grows only on a high alpine pass between the Val d'Eynes and [[Catalonia]]. Other examples include ''[[Arenaria montana]]'', ''[[Bulbocodium vernum]]'', and ''[[Ranunculus glacialis]]''. The genus most abundantly represented in the range is that of the [[saxifrage]]s, several species of which are endemic here.

===Fauna===
In their [[fauna]] the Pyrenees present some striking instances of [[endemism]]. The [[Pyrenean desman]] is found only in some of the streams of the northern slopes of these mountains; the only other [[desman]]s are confined to the rivers of the [[Caucasus]] in southern Russia. The Pyrenean euprocte (''Euproctus pyrenaicus''), an endemic relative of the [[salamander]], also lives in streams and lakes located at high altitudes. Among other peculiarities of Pyrenean fauna are blind insects in the [[cave]]rns of Ariège, the principal genera of which are ''[[Anophthalmus]]'' and ''Adelops''.

The [[Pyrenean ibex]] mysteriously became extinct in January 2000; the native Pyrenean [[brown bear]] was hunted to near-extinction in the 1990s, but it was re-introduced in 1996 when three bears were brought from [[Slovenia]]. The bear population has bred successfully, and there are now believed to be about 15 brown bears in the central region around [[Fos, Haute-Garonne|Fos]], but only four native ones are still living in the [[Aspe Valley]].

==Protected areas==

==Demographics and culture==
[[File:Bovins estive Pic du Midi Ossau.jpg|thumb|Some [[Blonde d'Aquitaine]] on summer pasture near the [[Pic du Midi d'Ossau]]]]
The Pyrenean region possesses a varied ethnology, [[folklore]] and history: see [[Andorra]]; [[Aragon]]; [[Ariège (department)|Ariège]]; [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]]; [[Béarn]]; [[Catalonia]]; [[Navarre]]; [[Roussillon]]. For their history, see also [[Almogavars]], [[Marca Hispanica]].

The principal languages spoken in the area are Spanish, French, [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (in [[Catalonia]] and [[Andorra]]), and [[Basque language|Basque]].
Also spoken, to a lesser degree, are the [[Occitan language]] (the [[Gascon language|Gascon]] and [[Languedocien]] dialects in France and the [[Aranese language|Aranese]] dialect in the [[Aran Valley]]).

An important feature of rural life in the Pyrenees is '[[transhumance]]', the moving of livestock from the farms in the valleys up to the higher grounds of the mountains for the summer.&lt;ref name=ariegecom&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ariege.com/en/discover-ariege/agro-pastoralism/the-transhumance |title=The Transhumance |publisher=Ariege.com |accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way the farming communities could keep larger herds than the lowland farms could support on their own. The principal animals moved were [[cows]] and [[sheep]], but historically most members of farming families also moved to the higher pastures along with their animals, so they also took with them [[pigs]], [[horses]]&lt;ref name=chevalEnPyrenees&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cheval-en-pyrenees.com/EN/rando-11.html |title=The traditional transhumance of pyrenean horses |accessdate=2016-02-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207175134/http://www.cheval-en-pyrenees.com/EN/rando-11.html |archive-date=2016-02-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[chickens]].&lt;ref name=ariegecom/&gt; Transhumance thus took the form of a mass biannual migration, moving uphill in May or June&lt;ref name=guide2midipyrenees&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guide2midipyrenees.com/information/10939/Transhumance--in--the--Midi-Pyrenees--region--of--south--west--France |title=Transhumance in the Midi-Pyrenees region of south west France |accessdate=2016-02-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008013739/http://www.guide2midipyrenees.com/information/10939/Transhumance--in--the--Midi-Pyrenees--region--of--south--west--France |archive-date=2016-10-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and returning to the farms in September or October. During the summer period, the families would live in basic stone cabins&lt;ref name=ariegecom/&gt; in the high mountains. Nowadays, industrialisation and changing agriculture practices have diminished the custom. However, the importance of transhumance continues to be recognised through its celebration in popular festivals.&lt;ref name=chevalEnPyrenees/&gt;&lt;ref name=guide2midipyrenees/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2014/06/05/1894535-transhumances-un-peu-de-civisme-svp.html |title=Transhumances dans les Hautes-Pyrénées : un peu de civisme, SVP ! |language=French |accessdate=2016-02-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007042103/http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2014/06/05/1894535-transhumances-un-peu-de-civisme-svp.html |archive-date=2015-10-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports and leisure==
Both sides of the Pyrenees are popular spots for winter sports such as [[alpine skiing]] and [[mountaineering]]. The Pyrenees are also a good place for athletes to do high-altitude training in the summertime, such as by bicycling and cross-country running.

In the [[summer]] and the [[autumn]], the Pyrenees are usually featured in two of cycling's grand tours, the [[Tour de France]] held annually in July and the [[Vuelta a España]] held in September. The stages held in the Pyrenees are often crucial legs of both tours, drawing hundreds of thousands of spectators to the region.

Three main [[long-distance footpath]]s run the length of the mountain range: the [[GR 10 (France)|GR 10]] across the northern slopes, the [[GR 11 (Spain)|GR 11]] across the southern slopes, and the [[Haute Randonnée Pyrénéenne|HRP]] which traverses peaks and ridges along a high altitude route. In addition, there are numerous marked and unmarked trails throughout the region.

''[[Pirena (race)|Pirena]]'' is a dog-[[mushing]] competition held in the Pyrenees.

A '''regional state''' or a '''regionalised unitary state''', is a [[unitary state]] in which authority has been [[decentralized]] to subnational regions. This term has yet to become widely used. One such example of a state is [[Ethiopia]], which has been divided into [[Regions of Ethiopia|ethnic-based regions]]. Another example is the [[United Kingdom]], where [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] have all been given their own degrees of [[devolution]] (i.e. a [[devolution|devolved government]])

Subnational regions are intermediate level between local and national government.

Natural '''salt pans''' or '''salt flats''' are flat expanses of ground covered with [[salt]] and other [[mineral]]s, usually shining white under the [[sun]].  They are found in [[desert]]s, and are natural formations (unlike [[salt evaporation pond]]s, which are artificial).

==Overview==
A salt pan forms by evaporation of a [[water]] pool such as a [[lake]] or [[pond]]. This happens in climates where the rate of water [[evaporation]] exceeds the rate of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], that is, in a desert. If the water cannot drain into the ground, it remains on the surface until it evaporates, leaving behind minerals precipitated from the salt ions [[solution|dissolved]] in the water. Over thousands of [[year]]s, the minerals (usually salts) accumulate on the surface.{{CN|date=May 2008}} These minerals reflect the sun's rays (through radiation) and often appear as white areas.

Salt pans can be dangerous. The crust of salt can conceal a [[quagmire]] of [[mud]] that can engulf a truck. The [[Qattara Depression]] in the eastern [[Sahara Desert]] contains many such traps which served as strategic barriers during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, C. (2003). ''Rommel's panzers: Rommel and the Panzer forces of the Blitzkrieg, 1940-1942'' (pp. 78–79). St. Paul, MN: MBI.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Death Valley,19820817,Devil's Golf Course.jpg|thumbnail|280px|[[Devil's Golf Course]], [[Death Valley National Park]], United States]]

==Examples==

The [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in [[Utah]], where many land [[speed]] records have been set, are a well-known salt pan in the arid regions of the [[western United States]].

The [[Etosha pan]], in the [[Etosha National Park]] in [[Namibia]], is another prominent example of a salt pan.

The [[Salar de Uyuni]] in [[Bolivia]] is the largest salt pan in the world. It contains 50%-70% of the world's [[lithium]] reserves.

'''San Vicente''' (also known as '''Chichontepec''' or '''Las Chiches''') is a [[stratovolcano]] in central [[El Salvador]]. It is located next to the town of San Vicente (hence the name) and is the second highest volcano in El Salvador. In the indigenous language [[Nahuat]], Chichontepec means ''the mountain of the two breasts'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.mtu.edu/volcanoes/central_america/el_salvador/san_vicente/|title=San Vicente|publisher=[[Michigan Technological University]]|accessdate=2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; because its [[double summit]] resembles a woman's bosom. The volcano has two [[Volcanic crater|crater]]s, one located in each summit, although not exactly at the top. Dense vegetation covers both summits. Numerous [[hot spring]]s and [[fumarole]]s are found on the northern and western flanks of the volcano. To the northeast, at 820 metres in a ravine of 180 metres longitude, there are fumaroles—fountains of clear and muddy water or small volcanoes of mud.

The last significant eruption occurred more than 1,700 years ago. The volcano may have had a very long history of repeated, and sometimes violent, eruptions, and at least once a large section of the volcano collapsed in a massive landslide.&lt;ref name=usgs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/ElSalvador/Publications/OFR01-367/past_events_san_vicente.html|title=Volcano-Hazard Zonation for San Vicente Volcano, El Salvador|authors=J.J. Major, S.P. Schilling, C.R. Pullinger, C.D. Escobar, and M.M. Howell|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey|USGS]]|accessdate=2009-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 9, 1995, [[Aviateca Flight 901]] crashed at the volcano, killing all 65 people on board.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elsalvador.com/Especiales/2010/TragediaSanVicente/nota3.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14538">The '''Societal Benefit Areas''' '''(SBAs)'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aprsaf.org/data/feature/f_086_3.pdf GEO's Societal Benefit Areas]&lt;/ref&gt; are eight environmental fields of interest, all of which relate to [[climate]], around which the [[Global Earth Observation System of Systems]] (GEOSS) project  is exerting its efforts.  These include: [[#Biodiversity and Ecosystem Sustainability|Biodiversity and Ecosystem Sustainability]], [[#Disaster Resilience|Disaster Resilience]], [[#Energy and Mineral Resources Management|Energy and Mineral Resources Management]], [[#Food Security and Sustainable Agriculture|Food Security and Sustainable Agriculture]], [[#Infrastructure and Transport Management|Infrastructure and Transport Management]], [[#Public Health Surveillance|Public Health Surveillance]], [[#Sustainable Urban Development|Sustainable Urban Development]], and [[#Water Resources Management|Water Resources Management]] around which a preliminary hierarchical vocabulary has been created.

One of the aims of [[GEOSS]] is to implement a proper system of Earth monitoring and to render information deriving from this process available to a global range of users.  Currently, the hierarchical vocabulary structuring these societal benefit categories and their subcategories are available only in English.  However, translations have been created for French, Spanish and Italian versions by Claudia Cialone and Kristin Stock of the Centre for Geospatial Science (CGS) at [[the University of Nottingham]], UK, with input from a number of people from the [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche]] (CNR) in Italy, the University of Zaragoza and the European Union [[Joint Research Centre]] (JRC). Translations have also been accomplished for a Slovenian version of the SBAs by the Biotehnical faculty of the [[University of Ljubljana]], SI.

== The GEOSS Societal Benefit Areas==
Listed below is a brief summary of the Societal Benefit categories and subcategories

===Disaster Resilience===
{{see|disaster management|resilience (organizational)}}
This SBA is meant to increase the system of the [[earth observation]] to protect human lives from [[natural hazard]]s such as [[tsunami]], [[sea]] and [[lake]] ice, [[floods]], [[volcanic eruptions]], wild fires etc.

===Public Health Surveillance===
{{see|Public Health Surveillance}}
The health SBA is meant to understand and to prevent the environmental factors related to human diseases.  Some subcategories included in this concern [[infectious diseases]], respiratory problems, [[environmental stress]], accidental [[death]] and [[injury]] and so forth.

===Energy and mineral resource management===
{{see|energy management|mineral resources}}
This SBA is concerned with the preservation and the operations related to energetic sources, and their renewability.  Some examples of subcategories for this field are: [[oil &amp; gas exploration]], refining and [[transport]] operations, [[renewable energy]] operations, global [[energy management]] etc..

===Water resources management===
{{see|water management|water resources}}
The water topic is inherent to [[hydrological]] research, evaluation and management and the impact of humans on the [[water cycle]].  The area includes subfields of interest such as global [[biogeochemistry]], [[fisheries]] and [[habitat]], [[telecommunication]] and [[navigation]], [[weather prediction|predictions]] etc.

===Infrastructure and transport===
{{see|transport|infrastructure}}
This category provides information for Earth observations support for planning, monitoring and management of infrastructure (dams, roads, rail, ports and pipelines) and transportation (air, land and sea).

===Food security and sustainable agriculture===
{{see|food security|sustainable agriculture}}
This field of concern embraces all those agricultural activities, or related subjects such as [[grazing]] systems, the economic trade of agricultural products, for monitoring the global condition of [[food]] including the prevention of [[desertification]].

===Biodiversity and ecosystem sustainability===
{{see|biodiversity|sustainability|ecosystem}}
This area is meant to disseminate information related to the investigation on the [[genetic diversity]] of [[species]] and more generally on the [[natural resources]] of the different [[ecosystems]] and the services available for their conservation.

==The Societal Benefit Areas and their translations==
Note that the following table is a temporary translation. Anyone with a particular expertise in environmental and/or [[natural sciences]] can contribute with further (verified and checked) corrections of the versions already listed below.

It is a form of [[townships of the People's Republic of China|township]]-level division which is typically part of a larger urban area, as opposed to a discrete [[towns of the People's Republic of China|town]] surrounded by rural areas, or a rural township known as a '''xiang''' (乡).

In general, urban areas are divided into subdistricts, and a subdistrict is sub-divided into several [[residential community|residential communities]] or [[neighbourhood|neighbourhoods]] as well as into villagers' groups (居民区/居住区，小区/社区，村民小组).

The subdistrict's administrative agency is the subdistrict office ({{Zh|s=街道办事处|p=jīedào bànshìchù}})&lt;ref&gt;"【街道办事处】 jiēdào bànshìchù 市辖区、不设区的市的人民政府派出机关。 在上一级政府领导下，负责本辖区内的社区服务、经济发展、社会治安等工作。" {{cite book|last1=|first1= |title=現代漢語詞典(第七版).

Because of the influence of the literal meaning of the Chinese word for 'subdistrict' (street [街道, jiedao]), the term is prone to alternative translations like 'street community'.

Eritrea is divided into six [[Regions of Eritrea|regions]] (''zobas'') and subdivided into [[Subregions of Eritrea|subregions]] ("sub-zobas"). The geographical extent of the regions is based on their respective hydrological properties. This a dual intent on the part of the Eritrean government: to provide each administration with sufficient control over its agricultural capacity, and to eliminate historical intra-regional conflicts. 

The regions, followed by the subregions, are:

The '''Holy Mountains Lavra''' ({{lang-uk|Свято-Успенська Святогірська Лавра}}, '''Sviatohirsk Lavra''' or the '''Sviatohirsk Cave Monastery'''; {{lang-ru|Свято-Успенская Святогорская лавра}}, '''Sviatogorskaya Lavra''' or the '''Sviatogorsky Cave Monastery''') is a major [[Monastery#Orthodox Christian monasteries|Orthodox Christian monastery]] on the steep right bank of the [[Seversky Donets]] River near the city of [[Sviatohirsk]] in [[Donetsk Oblast]] ([[oblast|province]]) of eastern [[Ukraine]]. The name comes from the surrounding [[Holy Mountains (Ukraine)|Holy Mountains]]. 

Today, the monastery forms the centrepiece of the [[National Nature Park Holy Mountains|Sviatohori National Nature Park]]. The [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)]] proclaimed it a [[lavra]] in 2004.

==History==

The first written mention of the monastery dates from 1627, although [[Sigismund von Herberstein]] had alluded to the "Holy Mountains" area as early as 1526. It is likely that the first monks settled the area in the 15th century. At the time it was a minor monastic establishment in the [[Wild Fields]] regularly ravaged by the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean Tatars]].

In 1787, [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]] had it shut down. The monastery's lands were secularized and donated to Prince [[Grigory Potemkin]], the Viceroy of [[New Russia]]. One of his heirs, Aleksander Mikhailovich Potemkin, and his wife [[Tatiana Borisovna Potemkina|Tatiana]], née Princess [[Galitzine]], financed the monastery's revival and rebuilding, starting in 1844. 

[[File:Svjatogorsk, Lavra 14.jpg|thumb|The Sviato-Pokrovska Church of the lavra.]]
Before the October Revolution, the Sviatohirsk Monastery owned a worker's shop, [[windmill]]s, various kinds of repair shops, and trading buildings. The lavra's main Dormition Cathedral was designed by [[Alexey Gornostaev]], who included a traditional [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] tower. In 1922, the monastery was shut down by the [[Bolsheviks]]. The Sanatorium for the [[Donbass]] workers was set up on the grounds.

Before [[World War I]], the monastery was inhabited by approximately 600 monks. During the 1930s, some of the churches were demolished by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]], along with other numerous religious attractions throughout the Soviet Union. 

After the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|fall of the Soviet Union]] and the regaining of [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|Ukrainian independence]] in 1991, the monastery was restored a year later. In 2004, the monastery was officially granted the status of a [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]] lavra. Today, the monastery community consists of more than 100 monks, and is increasing each year.

On October 25, 2005, the [[National Bank of Ukraine]] issued its 10-[[Ukrainian hryvnia|hryvnia]] commemorative coin depicting the Sviatohirsk Lavra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ua.for-ua.com/ukraine/2005/10/18/180124.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120701/http://ua.for-ua.com/ukraine/2005/10/18/180124.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-29 |title=NBU releases the Sviatohirsk Lavra on the "chervonets" |accessdate=2007-04-27 |work=ForUm |language=Russian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Norfolk Island]]:

*'''[[Country calling code|Country code]]: +672'''
*'''[[Area code]]: 3'''
*'''[[International call prefix]]: 00'''
* Fixed numbers are of the format +672 3 2X XXX.
* Mobile numbers are of the format +672 3 5X XXX and +672 3 8X XXX.

Country code +672 was originally assigned to [[Portuguese Timor]] until [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|annexed]] by [[Indonesia]] in 1975. It is also used for the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]], whose numbers are in area code 1. The code was also used for [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos Keeling Islands]] until October 1994 (encompassing area codes 2 and 4), when they were migrated to the +61 country code, under area code 091 (using exchange prefixes 62 for Christmas Island and 64 for the Cocos Islands). These numbers have since been migrated to 08 9162 and 08 9164 respectively.

'''Tzoah Rotachat''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: צוֹאָה רוֹתֵחַת, ''tsoah rothachath'' — "boiling excrement") in the [[Talmud]] and [[Zohar]] is a location in [[Gehenna]] (''Gehinnom'') where the souls of [[Jew]]s who committed certain sins are sent for punishment. This form of punishment is cited as being of extreme nature, if not the most extreme, in the sense that those individuals sentenced there are not given relief even on [[Shabbat]], and are not released after the standard twelve-month period.

==Babylonian Talmud==
The [[Babylonian Talmud]] lists the cause for a Jew being sent to Tzoah Rotachat as "all who scoff at the words of the wise men (i.e. [[Chazal]]) is judged in Tzoah Rotachat".  The Talmud Bavli also hints that the punishment has more of a physical implication to it. [[Rashi]] writes that he who engages in "excessive scoffing" (the exegesis here involves switching the "ה" of "להג" and replacing it with a "ע", as they both are one of the five guttural  sounds) (the former part of the verse) is met with the second part of the same "straining of the flesh", essentially being judged excessively (straining) of his body.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Eiruvin p. 21b&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of [[Jesus]] the Nazarene in boiling excrement is one of the disputed references to [[Jesus in the Talmud]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Schafer]] ''Jesus in the Talmud'' Page 88  - 2009 "The anonymous “master” alludes to the only parallel from the Bavli which mentions boiling excrement as a punishment"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Onkelos]] raises up [[Yeshu]] by necromancy,&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Van Voorst ''Jesus outside the New Testament: an introduction to the ancient ...'' Page 111  2000 "He replied, "To be in boiling semen." He called up Yeshu by necromancy. He said to him, "Who is honored in the next world? ... (upon being queried as to his spiritual location) He replied, "In boiling excrement." As a teacher has said, "Everyone who mocks the words of the wise is ..."&lt;/ref&gt; and asks him about his punishment in Gehinnom.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin W. Meyer, Charles Hughes - ''Jesus then &amp; now: images of Jesus in history and Christology'' 2001 Page 255  "He answered: "I boil in semen." Onqelos then raised Jesus of Nazareth. He asked him: "Who is important in this world? ... For the master taught, "Whoever scoffs at the word of the sages is punished (in hell) by boiling in feces. "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A Butta Jr, Steven E. Daskal ''The Jewish People and Jesus: Is It Time for Reconciliation? You Decide'' Author House 2010 Page 63   "Onkelos then raised the spirit of Jesus who also agreed that Israel was highly esteemed. Onkelos then asked Jesus about his punishment in hell. Jesus answered 'boiled in excrement'. “Anyone who mocks the words of the wise is punished ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus replies that he is in "boiling excrement."&lt;ref&gt;Schalom Ben-Chorin ''Brother Jesus: the Nazarene through Jewish eyes'' Page 3  2001 "'Onkelos asked Jesus, "And what is his punishment?" Jesus said to him, "Boiling excrement." As a baraitha 1 says, "Whoever mocks the words of the wise is punished with boiling excrement. — Come and see how different are Israel's mockers ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[[Onkelos]] the son of Klonimus..desired to convert himself (to [[Judaism]])..he brought  Yeshu (forth by means of/in) [[Séance]]..(Onkelos queried to Yeshu) whom is of importance in [[Jewish eschatology#Olam Haba - the afterlife and the world to come|that world]]? He (Yeshu) answered him; Yisroel (the children of Israel).  (Onkelos furthur queried) what/how (do you advise) to cleave to them? He (Yeshu) answered; "their benefit (lit. goodness) seek, their harm (lit. evil) do not seek (as) all/whomever touches them (with intent to harm) is as if (he) is touching the pupil of his (god's) eye".  He (Onkelos) said to him (to Yeshu); the judgement of that man&lt;ref&gt;"that man" is a talmudic expression when one queries another about an unfavored disposition and does not wish to be blunt with the question&lt;/ref&gt; is how/what? he (Yeshu) said to him (to Onkelos) "in excrement (that is) boiling".

(the Talmud goes on to praise the fact that Yeshu -as a Jew- spoke favorably about his Jewish bretheren, as opposed to Onkelos's preceding dialogue with [[Titus]] and [[Bilaam]] who both advised Onkelos to provoke the Jews); "come and see (the stark) difference between (even those) sinners of Israel and the prophets of those nations who [[Idol worship|worship idols]]" (i.e. even a "sinner of Israel" is of superior spiritual quality than the prophet of idolatry)
|Babylonian Talmud, Gittin 57a}}

==Commentaries==

===Rabbi Yosef Karo===
[[Joseph ben Ephraim Karo]] of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] (1488–1575), in his [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] work ''Maggid Meisharim'' ("Sermonizer on Ethics"), explains that just as in the human digestive order the liver, heart and other organs receive their sustaining nutrients from the ingested foods and whatever is of no need and "unworkable" is ''excreted'' to give fertility to works of low value ([[Sitra Achra]] "other side"), so too in heavenly judgment this soul is sent to the spiritual level equivalent of excrement and those that derive benefit thereof. As to the concept of ''boiling'' Rabbi Yosef relays as to imply during the time of heat and anger of that level (i.e. when the oven is hot), the soul is put there. Rabbi Yosef goes on to compare the idol worship of [[Heresy of Peor|Peor]] as giving sustenance to this specific level of Sitra Achra.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph ben Ephraim Karo]] ''Maggid Meisharim'' (at 19% into electronic text volume)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rabbi Yehuda Lowe's explanation===
[[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] of [[Prague]] (c.1520–1609), in his work ''Netzach Yisroel'' ("Eternity of Israel"), provides an in-depth analysis as to this seemingly unconnected sequence of action and punishment. Rabbi Lowe explains, as a rule of thumb, that the logic of [[Chazal]] is of an unrelated plane to that of common human intellect. Thus, one who scoffs at it is judged in the opposite of this higher plane, i.e. Tzoah Rotachat, which is considered a matter of irrelation to the relatively superior human body (since it is released as waste) and the antithesis of godly knowledge and presence (as is brought in Talmud Sukka p.&amp;nbsp;42b that one is obligated to distance himself from the excrement of a child who has the ability of speech since this excrement produces an intense odor comparative to infant who cannot yet speak {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}). Rabbi Lowe concludes that excrement is the polar opposite of refined godly intellect and worship and is thus the natural consequence of the scoffer thereof and of the Jew who chooses idol worship and [[Shituf]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] ''Netzach Yisroel'' (at 14% into electronic text volume)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There is a place in Gehinom - and levels therin - that are called Tzoah rotachat. and therein is the filth of souls that are sullied from all filth of this world and (the soul itself) get(s) cleansed and are brought up (but) this filth remains over there. and these evil levels that are called tzoah rotachat are in authority of this (leftover) filth.  and the fire of gehinnom rules on this filth that is left over, and there are liable individuals that sully themselves with sins on a constant basis and do not undertake to cleanse themselves of them (those sins), and they decease without repentance. and (while alive) they sinned and caused others to sin and they were of a stubborn nature all the while (they were) alive and did not submit before their master in this world.  These are judged over there in this filth and in this Tzoah Rotachat that never gets released..on [[Shabbat]] and [[Rosh Chodesh]] and [[Jewish holidays|Yom Tov]] the fire remains but they are not judged (but, on the other hand) are not released|Zohar vol. 2 p. 150b{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}}}
