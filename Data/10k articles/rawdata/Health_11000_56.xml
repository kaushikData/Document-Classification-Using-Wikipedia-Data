The '''Asbestos strike''' of 1949, based in and around [[Asbestos, Quebec]], was a four-month labour dispute by asbestos miners. It has traditionally been portrayed as a turning point in Quebec history that helped lead to the [[Quiet Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/asbestos-strike/ Asbestos Strike] ''The Canadian Encyclopedia.''&lt;/ref&gt; It also helped launch the careers of [[Jean Marchand]], [[Gérard Pelletier]], and [[Pierre Trudeau]].

== Events ==
At midnight on February 14, 1949, [[miner]]s walked off the job at four [[asbestos]] mines in the [[Eastern Townships]], near [[Asbestos, Quebec]] and [[Thetford Mines]]. Though these mines were owned by either American or English-Canadian companies, almost all the workers were [[francophone]]s. The largest company was the American [[Johns-Manville]] firm. The union had several demands. These included elimination of asbestos dust inside and outside of the mill; a fifteen cent an hour general wage increase; a five cent an hour increase for night work; a social security fund to be administered by the union; the implementation of the [[Rand Formula]]; and "double time" payment for work on Sundays and holidays.  These demands were radical in Quebec at the time, and they were rejected by the owners.

On February 13, 1949, the workers voted to strike. The workers were represented by the [[National Federation of Mining Industry Employees]] and the [[Canadian and Catholic Federation of Labour]]. [[Jean Marchand]] was the general-secretary of the latter, and is often seen as the [[de facto]] leader of the strike. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The strike was illegal. Quebec Premier [[Maurice Duplessis]] sided strongly with the companies, largely due to his hostility to all forms of socialism. The provincial government sent squads of police to protect the mines. Duplessis' [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] party had long been closely allied to the [[Catholic Church]], but parts of the church would move to support the workers. The population and media of Quebec were sympathetic to the strikers. The lead reporter for ''[[Le Devoir]]'' was [[Gérard Pelletier]], who was deeply sympathetic to the cause of the workers. [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau]] also covered the strike in a sympathetic manner.

Six weeks into the strike, Johns-Manville hired [[strikebreaker]]s to keep the mines open. The community was deeply divided as some of the workers crossed the picket lines. The strike turned violent as the 5000 strikers attacked, destroying the property of the "scabs" and intimidating them through force. More police were sent to protect the strikebreakers. The striking miners and police fought on the picket line and hundreds of miners were arrested. Some of the incidents included: On March 14, a dynamite explosion destroyed part of a railroad track that led into the [[Johns-Manville Corporation]] Canadian subsidiary property. On March 16, strikers overturned a company jeep, injuring a passenger. On March 18, a company official was abducted from his home and severely beaten.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Strikers had the support of Canadian unions and some of the Catholic Church in Quebec. The Catholic Church, which had until that time been largely supportive of the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] government of Duplessis, profoundly affected the strike. Some priests backed the companies, but most sided with the strikers. On March 5, [[Archbishop]] [[Joseph Charbonneau]] delivered a fiercely pro-union speech asking all Catholics to donate to help the strikers. Premier Duplessis asked the church to transfer the archbishop to Vancouver because of his encouragement of the strike. The church refused, signaling a dramatic change in Quebec society. Charbonneau did resign and became the chaplain at a hospital in Victoria, British Columbia.

On May 5, the strikers launched an effort to shut down the mine in Asbestos by barricading the mine and every road into and out of town. Police attempts to force their way through the barricades failed. The strikers backed down when the police pledged to open fire on the strikers. The next day, the [[riot act]] was read and mass arrests of the strikers were begun, including a raid on the church. The arrested strikers were beaten and their leaders severely battered.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

After the arrests, the unions decided that they must compromise, and began negotiations with the company. Archbishop [[Maurice Roy]], of Quebec City, served as mediator. In June, the workers agreed to return to work with few gains. When the dispute ended, miners received a small pay increase, but many never regained their jobs. In the long term, both conditions and wages of the workers considerably improved.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

== Significance ==
One of the most violent and bitter labour disputes in [[Quebec]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] history, the strike led to great upheaval in Quebec society.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The strike was in large part led by [[Jean Marchand]], a labour unionist. Journalist [[Gérard Pelletier]] and future [[Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau]], then a journalist, also played significant roles. Marchand, Pelletier and Trudeau would eventually become prominent Canadian politicians and were known later in their political careers as ''les trois colombes'' (''the Three Wise Men''). They would largely establish the direction of Quebec federalism for a generation. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Trudeau edited a book, ''The Asbestos Strike'', that presented the strike as the origin of modern Quebec, portraying it as "a violent announcement that a [[Quiet Revolution|new era]] had begun." Some historians{{Who|date=January 2013}} argue that the strikers were simply pursuing better conditions, and that the resulting change in society was an unintended byproduct.

Popular opinion for most of the strike was broadly supportive of the striking workers. This support, beyond its moral value, manifested itself through monetary support and the supply of provisions. It is likely that the strike would have quickly failed had it not been for the establishment of this kind of support.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In 2004, a [[French language|French-language]] book about the strike by author-historian [[Esther Delisle]] and [[Pierre K. Malouf]] was published under the title ''[[Le Quatuor d'Asbestos]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2661">'''Auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder''' ('''ANSD''') is a specific form of hearing loss defined by the presence of normal or near-normal [[otoacoustic emission]]s (OAEs) but the absence of normal [[middle ear reflexes]] and severely abnormal or completely absent [[auditory brainstem response]] (ABRs).

Individuals presenting with this recently recognised hearing loss appear to display sporadic windows of hearing and not. Very few (1 in 14) will go on to develop normal speech and language but with poor [[speech perception]] in background noise and in others, no speech perception and therefore language development is possible.

The condition was originally termed [[auditory neuropathy]] (AN) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/brain/119.3.741 |last1=Starr |first1=A. |last2=Picton  |first2=T.W. |last3=Sininger |first3=Y. |last4=Hood |first4=L.J. |last5=Berlin |first5=C.I. |year=1996 |title=Auditory neuropathy |journal=Brain |publisher= |volume=119 |issue= |pages=741–753 |pmid=8673487}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2001 as Auditory Neuropathy / Auditory Dys-synchrony (AN/AD) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berlin |first1=C.I. |last2=Hood |first2=L.J. |last3=Rose |first3=K. |year=2001 |title=On renaming auditory neuropathy as auditory dys-synchrony |journal=Audiology Today |volume=13 |issue= |pages=15–17 |url=http://freefilehosting.net/download/42030 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; (to include those cases where no true [[neuropathy]] was apparent).

'''Avicenna Research Institute''' ('''ARI'''; {{lang-fa| پژوهشگاه ابن سینا}}) ) – affiliated to ACECR – was established in [[Tehran]] in order to achieve latest medical technologies through conducting clinical and laboratory research projects in 1998. The institute consists of three research centers including Reproductive Biotechnology Research Center (RBRC), Monoclonal Antibody Research Center (MARC) and Nanobiotechnology Research Center (NBRC). ARI also includes Avicenna Biotechnology Incubator and Avicenna Infertility Clinic (AIC).
 
Named after [[Ibn Sina]], the research institute was found in 1998 in [[Shahid Beheshti University]] in [[Tehran]].

Reproductive Biotechnology Research Center (RBRC) includes Embryology and Andrology, Reproductive Genetics and Biotechnology, Reproductive Immunology, Reproductive Infections and Bio law &amp; Ethics departments.
For the purpose of laying a ground to provide therapeutic services and applied research findings in the field of infertility treatment, Avicenna Infertility Clinic (AIC) was founded. Five specialized clinics including Infertility Treatment, Recurrent Abortion, Perinatology, Sexual Health and Replacement Therapies organize AIC.

Monoclonal Antibody Research Center (MARC) established in 2001 consists of Hybridoma, Immunochemistry and Antibody-Antigen Engineering Departments.

Following introduction of nanotechnology and nanobiotechnology as one of the main priorities of the country, Nanobiotechnology Research Center (NBRC) was founded in 2005. Three departments including Nanotechnology, Recombinant Technology and Medical Diagnostic Products form NBRC.

Interaction between specialists of various professional fields such as biology, biotechnology and clinical and molecular medicine in 11 research departments provide the ground for educational and scientific activities.

Considering modern equipment and enjoying specialized team in Avicenna Research Institute, Medical Biotechnology Incubator initiated its activity under technical, economical and scientific supports of ARI, in 2010.

The main activities of this center are summarized in the fields of reproductive biotechnology, monoclonal antibodies, nanobiotechnology, etc. All the established sections in this center have the possibility to benefit from the facilities and services provided by Reproductive Biotechnology Research Center, Monoclonal Antibody Research Center, Nanobiotechnology Research Center and Avicenna Infertility Clinic.
Medical Biotechnology Incubator will foster new professions and encourage entrepreneurs working within the newly founded units in the above fields.

The most prominent missions of ARI:
* Conducting basic, applied and therapeutic research projects in the field of reproduction and cancer treatment
* Identifying and fulfilling requirements related to biotechnologies in diagnostic and therapeutic areas
* Attracting M.Sc and Ph.D students to conduct thesis
* Arranging postgraduate courses on modern technologies in collaboration with different universities

In [[epidemiology]], the '''basic reproduction number''' (sometimes called '''basic reproductive ratio''', or incorrectly '''basic reproductive rate''', and denoted '''''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''', ''r nought'') of an [[infection]] can be thought of as the number of cases one case generates on average over the course of its infectious period, in an otherwise uninfected population.&lt;ref name="Fraser"&gt;{{cite journal

This metric is useful because it helps determine whether or not an [[infectious disease]] can spread through a population. The roots of the basic reproduction concept can be traced through the work of [[Alfred Lotka]], [[Ronald Ross]], and others, but its first modern application in epidemiology was by George MacDonald in 1952, who constructed population models of the spread of [[malaria]].

When

:''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1

the infection will die out in the long run. But if

:''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1

the infection will be able to spread in a population.

Generally, the larger the value of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the harder it is to control the epidemic. For simple models and a 100%-effective vaccine, the proportion of the population that needs to be vaccinated to prevent sustained spread of the infection is given by 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1/''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The basic reproduction number is affected by several factors including the duration of [[infectivity]] of affected patients, the infectiousness of the organism, and the number of susceptible people in the population that the affected patients are in contact with.

In populations that are not homogeneous, the definition of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is more subtle. The definition must account for the fact that a typical infected individual may not be an average individual. As an extreme example, consider a population in which a small portion of the individuals mix fully with one another while the remaining individuals are all isolated. A disease may be able to spread in the fully mixed portion even though a randomly selected individual would lead to fewer than one secondary case.  This is because the typical infected individual is in the fully mixed portion and thus is able to successfully cause infections. In general, if the individuals who become infected early in an epidemic may be more (or less) likely to transmit than a randomly chosen individual late in the epidemic, then our computation of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; must account for this tendency. An appropriate definition for ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in this case is "the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infected individual early in an epidemic".&lt;ref name="Diekmann"&gt;{{cite journal

Say that an infectious individual makes β contacts per unit time producing new infections with a mean infectious period of 1/γ.  Therefore, the basic reproduction number is

::''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''&amp;beta;''/''&amp;gamma;''

== With varying latent periods ==
In cases of diseases with varying latent periods, the basic reproduction number can be calculated as the sum of the reproduction number for each transition time into the disease.  An example of this is tuberculosis.  Blower et al.&lt;ref&gt;Blower, S. M., Mclean, A. R., Porco, T. C., Small, P. M., Hopewell, P. C., Sanchez, M. A., et al.  (1995).  "The intrinsic transmission dynamics of tuberculosis epidemics."  ''Nature Medicine'', 1, 815–821.&lt;/ref&gt; calculated from a simple model of TB the following reproduction number:

::''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;FAST&lt;/sup&gt; + ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;SLOW&lt;/sup&gt;	

In their model, it is assumed that the infected individuals can develop active TB by either direct progression (the disease develops immediately after infection) considered above as FAST tuberculosis or endogenous reactivation (the disease develops years after the infection) considered above as SLOW tuberculosis.

==Other uses==
''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is also used as a measure of individual reproductive success in [[population ecology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=de Boer |author2=Rob J | title = Theoretical Biology | url = http://theory.bio.uu.nl/rdb/books/tb.pdf | accessdate = 2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[evolutionary invasion analysis]] and [[life history theory]]. It represents the average number of offspring produced over the lifetime of an individual (under ideal conditions).

For simple [[population modeling|population models]], ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can be calculated, provided an explicit decay rate (or "death rate") is given. In this case, the reciprocal of the decay rate (usually&amp;nbsp;1/''d'') gives the average lifetime of an individual. When multiplied by the average number of offspring per individual per timestep (the "birth rate"&amp;nbsp;''b''), this gives&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''d''. For more complicated models that have variable growth rates (e.g. because of [[density dependence|self-limitation]] or dependence on food densities), the maximum growth rate should be used.

==Limitations of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;==
When calculated from [[mathematical models]], particularly [[ordinary differential equation]]s, what is often claimed to be ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is, in fact, simply a threshold, not the average number of secondary infections. There are many methods used to derive such a threshold from a mathematical model, but few of them always give the true value of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. This is particularly problematic if there are intermediate vectors between hosts, such as [[malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li J, Blakeley D, ((Smith? RJ)) |title=The Failure of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; |journal=Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine |volume=2011 |issue=527610 |year=2011 |doi=10.1155/2011/527610
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What these thresholds will do is determine whether a disease will die out (if&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1) or whether it may become epidemic (if&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1), but they generally can not compare different diseases. Therefore, the values from the table above should be used with caution, especially if the values were calculated from mathematical models.

Methods include the [[survival function]], rearranging the largest [[eigenvalue]] of the [[Jacobian matrix]], the next-generation method,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Diekmann O, Heesterbeek JA |title=Mathematical epidemiology of infectious diseases: model building, analysis and interpretation|publisher=New York: Wiley|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; calculations from the intrinsic growth rate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chowell G, Hengartnerb NW, Castillo-Chaveza C, Fenimorea PW, Hyman JM |title=The basic reproductive number of Ebola and the effects of public health measures: the cases of Congo and Uganda|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=229 |issue=1 |pages=119–126 |year=2004 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2004.03.006 |pmid=15178190|arxiv=q-bio/0503006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; existence of the endemic equilibrium, the number of susceptibles at the endemic equilibrium, the average age of infection &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ajelli M |author2=Iannelli M |author3=Manfredi P |author4=Ciofi degli Atti, ML |last-author-amp=yes|title=Basic mathematical models for the temporal dynamics of HAV in medium-endemicity Italian areas|journal=Vaccine|volume=26

Few of these methods agree with one another, even when starting with the same system of [[differential equations]]. Even fewer actually calculate the average number of secondary infections. Since ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is rarely observed in the field and is usually calculated via a mathematical model, this severely limits its usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heffernan JM, Smith RJ, Wahl LM |title=Perspectives on the Basic Reproductive Ratio |url= http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/2/4/281|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=281–93 |year=2005 |pmid=16849186 |doi=10.1098/rsif.2005.0042 |pmc=1578275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the 2011 film ''[[Contagion (film)|Contagion]]'', a fictional medical disaster thriller, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;  calculations are presented to reflect the progression of a fatal viral infection from case studies to a pandemic.

[[File:Birchville Dam spillway.jpg|thumb|right|Birchville Dam]]'''Birchville Dam''' is believed to be the second unreinforced concrete arch dam built for water supply in [[New Zealand]]. It was built in 1930 for the [[Upper Hutt]] Borough Council to provide increased water capacity for the borough and replaced a water supply weir built in 1913–1914 at the same location on Clarke's Creek, near [[Birchville]]. Decommissioned in 1958, when Upper Hutt joined the Wellington regional water scheme, this dam is now an historic attraction on the Cannon Point Walkway.

This Dam does not appear in the New Zealand Dam Inventory (1994).

==History==
At the beginning of the 20th century the Wellington Acclimatization Society had a trout-rearing pond on the northern bank of the [[Hutt River (New Zealand)|Hutt River]] near where Clarke's Creek entered the Hutt River, just downstream of the first [[Akatarawa]] Road bridge. The water for this pond was taken from Clarke's Creek. In 1912, civil engineer G. Laing-Meason proposed a water supply scheme to the Upper Hutt Town Board that involved constructing a weir further up Clarke's Creek and piping the water to Upper Hutt and as far as [[Silverstream]]. Construction commenced in 1913 and was completed by February 1914. The Minister of Public Works officially opened the water supply scheme on 28 February 1914. Although G. Laing-Meason had initially proposed an option using 10&amp;nbsp;inch pipes and a 100,000 gallon reservoir, to allow for extending the water supply as far as the Silverstream Bridge. The constructed scheme only used 8&amp;nbsp;inch pipes and a 50,000 gallon reservoir. By the mid-1920s, Upper Hutt residents were complaining that there was inadequate water pressure and the now [[Upper Hutt City Council|Upper Hutt Borough Council]] began refusing to supply water to Hutt County residents just outside the borough boundaries in [[Heretaunga, Wellington|Heretaunga]] and [[Pinehaven]].

In early 1930, the Upper Hutt Borough Council instructed consulting engineer H. F. Toogood to call tenders for a Concrete Arch Dam 50-foot height and 90-foot radius to be constructed at the water supply headworks. Tenders closed on Monday 7 April 1930. On 12 April, M. G. Templeton was awarded the contract for 5800 pounds, although an extension of time was recommended on 10 November 1930 and an additional 580 pounds (10%) loan was needed on 2 February 1931. The engineer advised that the maintenance period expired on 16 March 1931.

The constructed dam is 15 metres high from base of the foundations to the crest but infill boulders on the downstream face, to prevent scouring make the dam appear lower. The dam is 2.33 metres thick at it base and has a 1.25-metre wide parapet. The arch is 46 metres long and of a 27.5-metre constant radius, spanning a gap 40 metres wide.

The dam remained in service until 1958, when Upper Hutt commenced taking water from the Kaitoke regional water scheme.

In 1988 the Birchville Dam reservoir was drained and found to have silted up to 6.3 metres below the spillway.

Loewenfeld was the founder of Chiltern Herb Farms in England,&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society'', Royal Horticultural Society (Great Britain), 1964, p. 497.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the earliest producers of high-quality dried herbs, and was one of the first members of the [[Soil Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Loewenfeld, Claire. ''British Medical Journal'', 1 April 1978, volume 1, issue 6119: "Claire Loewenfeld, who died in August 1974, was one of the first members of the Soil Association, reintroduced the use of flavouring herbs in Britain, and worked out a vegetable and fruit juice diet for children with coeliac disease at [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]]. A protagonist of natural vitamins, and a sturdy campaigner against processed foods and the health hazards of added chemicals ..."&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote a number of books about nutrition, including ''Britain's Wild Larder: Fungi'' (1956), ''Herb Gardening'' (1967) and ''Everything you should know about your food'' (1978).

==Early life==
Claire was born in Berlin, Germany. Her parents were Arthur and Jeanette (née Jacobi) Lewisohn. She married Günther Emmanuel Loewenfeld (November 1895&amp;ndash;January 1984) on 5 July 1921. They continued to live in Berlin in the period following their marriage.&lt;ref name=Lowenfeld2&gt;[http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/GLD/hits?r=d&amp;origSearch=true&amp;o=DataType&amp;n=10&amp;l=d&amp;c=1&amp;locID=herlib&amp;secondary=false&amp;u=CA&amp;t=KW&amp;s=2&amp;NA=loewenfeld  Gale Literary Databases - Claire Loewen feld], Accessed 28 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Claire and Günther were from [[Jewish]] families; however, Günther was brought up in the [[Protestant]] faith.&lt;ref name=Pauck/&gt;  Between 1923 and 1925 they spent their weekends with friends Fritz and Lily Pincus in a rented house, in [[Groß Glienicke|Glienicke]], on the outskirts of [[Potsdam]]. In 1925 the Loewenfelds and Pincuses moved out of Berlin to adjacent rented properties which they shared on the [[Küssel]], a [[peninsula]] jutting out into [[Templiner See|Lake Templiner]] in a rural district of Potsdam. Both husbands commuted to Berlin to work. By 1931 Claire and Günther had two children, Peter and Verena, likewise the Pincuses had two children. Both couples also had their relatives living with them from time to time and as more living space was needed they decided to buy their respective properties enlarging and linking them. ''Das Haus auf dem Küssel'' (The House on the Küssel) as it had become known was redesigned, to include both shared areas and private quarters, by a well-known Potsdam architect, Stephan Hirtzel.&lt;ref name=Pincus1&gt;Pincus, Lily ''Verloren, gewonnen: Mein Weg von Berlin nach London'', Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Another close friend of both families, [[Paul Tillich]], a German-American Protestant [[theologian]] wrote a dedication on the inauguration of their new home entitled, (in English), ''Space and Time in Dwelling''.&lt;ref name=Pauck&gt;Pauck, Wilhelm &amp; Marion, ''Paul Tillich: His Life &amp; Thought–Volume 1: Life''. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tillich,Paul; Palmer, Michael F.

During early 1936 the Loewenfelds travelled to [[Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] where they witnessed at first-hand the initial stages of the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab uprising against British mandate and Jewish immigration]]. They spent the summer of 1936 near [[Cortina d'Ampezzo|Cortina]] in the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Dolomites]] where they met Tillich who was on a European lecture tour. In Tillich's diary an account of their time in Palestine records: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"While in Palestine, Claire and Guenther were in constant danger of their lives. Once, the only thing that saved them was their Arab guide saying they were German Nazis. Hitler is the big man with the Arabs. Mussolini gives them money to spite the British."
&lt;ref name=Tillich1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From 1937 Claire and Lily's home in the Küssel provided a refuge for Jewish children, whose parents had been arrested or had been abandoned and were homeless.&lt;ref name=Pincus1/&gt; Claire's family continued to live in Germany until the latter part of 1938 when they left Potsdam because of the increasing likelihood of arrest. The Loewenfelds had made arrangements in advance for their belongings to be transported to England. In December 1938 both children, Peter and Verena were evacuated as part of the [[Kindertransport]] rescue mission travelling on board the [[SS Washington]] from [[Hamburg]] ato [[Southampton]] and then to an English boarding school, [[St Christopher School, Letchworth]], [[Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Alien and Exemption from Internment - Refugee Records from 1939 Held by [[The National Archives]], [[Kew]] HO 396/56/231 &amp; HO 396/56/230&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Günther joined relatives in England and Claire travelled first to Switzerland before rejoining her husband in early 1939.&lt;ref name=Pincus1/&gt; The family settled in rural [[Buckinghamshire]] in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Note:-Loewenfeld listing in British Telephone Directory 1941&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Rosa rubiginosa hips.jpg|right|thumb|125px|[[Rose hips]] are a particularly rich source of vitamin C]]
During her time in Berlin in the 1920s Claire worked at an institute "providing slides and illustrations" for a university.&lt;ref name=Lowenfeld2/&gt; In late 1938 Claire Loewenfeld studied at the Maximilian Bircher-Benner's clinic in [[Zurich, Switzerland]] obtaining a special diploma in nutrition.&lt;ref name=Pincus1/&gt; During the Second World War, she worked at the [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] for Sick Children in London, England as a dietician.&lt;ref name=Gobell/&gt; While there she specialised in the treatment of coeliac disease and successfully developed a new diet to treat it, based on Bircher-Benner's recipes, involving raw vegetable and fruit juice; she was also involved in longitudinal comparative studies assessing various treatments for the condition.&lt;ref&gt;Wyllie, W. G.; Payne, W.W.; and Beynon, D. W. [http://adc.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/26/125/4.pdf "A Dietetic Approach to the Coeliac Affection"], ''Arch. Dis. Child.'', 1951, vol 26, pp, 4&amp;ndash;19, accessed 29 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
During the war, Loewenfeld wrote to ''The Times'' and the ''British Medical Journal'' about the negative impact the shortage of fresh fruit and vegetables was having on the nation's health, and advocated the collection and distribution of [[rose hip]]s from the hedgerows, as they provided "our highest home-grown source of [[Vitamin C]]".&lt;ref name=Lowenfeld1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Fruit from the hedgerows - Vitamins in Rose Hips, | newspaper=The Times | date=29 August 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a leaflet she had prepared called ''Wild Rose Hips in War Time. Their Collection, Preparation and Use'' on how to exploit rose hips was immediately in huge demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Vitamins in Rose Hips | newspaper=The Times | date=4 October 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Notes on Books - Claire Loewenfeld | journal=British Medical Journal | volume=2 | issue=4254 | date=27 June 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 18000 leaflets were sent by Claire to individuals as well as being widely distributed to schools and hospitals. In response, the government organised a nationwide initiative to collect roadside rose hips which, with the help of the [[Women's Institutes]], were processed into syrup for babies and children. This was the first of several leaflets; there were an additional three under the title ''Wild Plants and Herbs'', and three more grouped together under the heading ''Wild Fruits and Berries'' which were also distributed with the assistance of the newsagent [[WH Smith]].&lt;ref name=Loewenfeld2&gt;(Loewenfeld and Beck 1974). See Introduction p.13 of Revised 1978 edition published after Claire's death&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
After the war, Claire set up Chiltern Herb Farm in [[Buckland Common]], Buckinghamshire, with her husband, who before the war had practiced as an [[Attorney at law|attorney]] and later had become a [[landscape architect]].&lt;ref name=Tillich2/&gt; Her experience of using dried herbs to treat sick children during the war had made her aware that the standard preparation techniques resulted in material of poor nutrional value. Experimentation led to methods for producing dried herbs of higher quality which coincided with an increasing demand in Britain for such culinary products.&lt;ref name=Loewenfeld2/&gt; She also gave lectures and demonstrations,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0VPOAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Claire+Loewenfeld%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;dq=%22Claire+Loewenfeld%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=DBCgSpvYDImGNv3N_ZsB The electrical journal, Volume 131] Retrieved, 03-09-2009&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote and collaborated on several books about healthy eating, herb gardening, and cooking with herbs and spices, some of which were also translated into German, Dutch and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/wcidentities/lccn-n82-33001 WorldCat listing for Claire Loewenfeld] Retrieved, 03-09-2009&lt;/ref&gt; She was a [[vegetarian]] &lt;ref name=Gobell/&gt; and also promoted the benefits of [[Birchermüesli]], or müesli as it is better known, which she learned the health benefits of while training at the Bircher-Benner Clinic. She translated into [[English language|English]] the book by Ruth Bircher which also contained the original recipe for the cereal food (Bircher 1961). She was one of the first members of the Soil Association, advocating freshly prepared food and campaigning against the processing of food and addition of chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;Loewenfeld, Claire. ''British Medical Journal'', 1 April 1978, volume 1, issue 6119.&lt;/ref&gt; Claire was also a member of the women's volunteer organisation, [[Soroptimist|Soroptimist International]].&lt;ref name=Lowenfeld2/&gt;

Claire Loewenfeld died on 20&amp;nbsp;August 1974, and is buried at St Lawrence's Church, [[Cholesbury]],  [[Buckinghamshire]], near where she lived, alongside her husband Gunther Loewenfeld's cousins, [[Margaret Lowenfeld]] and [[Helena Wright]] née Lowenfeld.

The '''diathesis–stress model''' is a [[Psychology|psychological theory]] that attempts to explain a disorder, or its trajectory, as the result of an interaction between a predispositional vulnerability and a stress caused by life experiences. The term [[Predisposition (psychology)|diathesis]] derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] term (διάθεσις) for a predisposition, or sensibility.  A diathesis can take the form of genetic, psychological, biological, or situational factors.&lt;ref name="Ingram"&gt;Ingram, R. E. &amp; Luxton, D. D. (2005). "Vulnerability-Stress Models." In B.L. Hankin &amp; J. R. Z. Abela (Eds.), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1Fd0LneB724C&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;ots=b90ZsadHn-&amp;dq=Development%20of%20Psychopathology%3A%20A%20vulnerability%20stress%20perspective&amp;lr&amp;pg=PR7#v=onepage&amp;q=Development%20of%20Psychopathology:%20A%20vulnerability%20stress%20perspective&amp;f=false Development of Psychopathology: A vulnerability stress perspective]'' (pp. 32-46). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; A large range of differences exists among individuals' vulnerabilities to the development of a disorder.&lt;ref name="Ingram"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ormel2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ormel J.|author2=Jeronimus, B.F.|author3=Kotov, M.|author4=Riese, H.|author5=Bos, E.H.|author6=Hankin, B. | year = 2013 | title = Neuroticism and common mental disorders: Meaning and utility of a complex relationship | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 686–697 | doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2013.04.003 | pmid=23702592 | pmc=4382368}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The diathesis, or predisposition, interacts with the individual's subsequent [[Stress (psychology)|stress]] response. Stress is a life event or series of events that disrupts a person's psychological equilibrium and may catalyze the development of a disorder.&lt;ref name="Oatleyb"/&gt; Thus the diathesis–stress model serves to explore how biological or genetic traits (''diatheses'') interact with environmental influences (''stressors'') to produce disorders such as depression, anxiety, or schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="PreventionAction"&gt;Prevention Action. ''Diathesis-stress models''  Retrieved from http://www.preventionaction.org/reference/diathesis-stress-models&lt;/ref&gt;

The diathesis–stress model asserts that if the combination of the predisposition and the stress exceeds a threshold, the person will develop a [[psychological disorder|disorder]].&lt;ref name="Lazarus"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lazarus R. S. | year = 1993 | title = From psychological stress to the emotions: A history of changing outlooks | url = http://commonweb.unifr.ch/artsdean/pub/gestens/f/as/files/4660/18222_105619.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 1–21 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ps.44.020193.000245 | pmid=8434890}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

The use of the term ''diathesis'' in medicine and in the specialty of psychiatry dates back to the 1800s; however, the diathesis–stress model was not introduced and used to describe the development of [[psychopathology]] until it was applied to explaining [[schizophrenia]] in the 1960s by [[Paul Meehl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paul E. Meehl| title=Schizotaxia, schizotypy, schizophrenia. | journal=American Psychologist | volume=17 | issue=12 | pages=827–838 | year=1962 | DOI=10.1037/h0041029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ingram"/&gt;
The diathesis–stress model is used in many fields of [[psychology]], specifically for studying the development of psychopathology.&lt;ref name="Sigelman"&gt;Sigelman, C. K. &amp; Rider, E. A. (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=8smBuRecmDsC&amp;pg=PT656&amp;dq=Life-span+human+development+6th+ed&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=P1_HUJqFG8iy0AH5ioGoAw&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA Developmental psychopathology.]  ''Life-span human development'' (6th ed.) (pp. 468-495). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; It is useful for the purposes of understanding the interplay of [[nature and nurture]] in the susceptibility to [[psychological disorders]] throughout the lifespan.&lt;ref name="Sigelman"/&gt; Diathesis–stress models can also assist in determining who will develop a disorder and who will not.&lt;ref name="Oatleya"&gt;Oatley, K., Keltner, D., &amp; Jenkins, J. M. (2006a). "Emotions and mental health in adulthood." ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RGHghPqIO_8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Understanding+emotions+2nd+ed&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rl_HUMGGB6jh0wGwyoDYBg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA Understanding Emotions]'' (2nd ed.) (pp. 353-383). Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the context of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], the diathesis–stress model can help explain why Person A may become depressed while Person B does not, even when exposed to the same stressors.&lt;ref name="Sigelman"/&gt;  More recently, the diathesis–stress model has been used to explain why some individuals are more at risk for developing a disorder than others.&lt;ref name="Gazelle"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gazelle H. |author2=Ladd G. W. | year = 2003 | title = Anxious solitude and peer exclusion: A diathesis stress model of internalizing trajectories in childhood | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8624.00534/abstract | journal = Child Development | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 257–278 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8625.00634 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, children who have a family history of depression are generally more vulnerable to developing a depressive disorder themselves.  A child who has a family history of depression and who has been exposed to a particular stressor, such as [[peer rejection|exclusion or rejection by his or her peers]], would be more likely to develop depression than a child with a family history of depression that has an otherwise positive social network of peers.&lt;ref name="Gazelle"/&gt;

The diathesis–stress model has also served as useful in explaining other poor (but non-clinical) developmental outcomes.

''Protective factors'', such as positive social networks or high self-esteem, can counteract the effects of stressors and prevent or curb the effects of disorder.&lt;ref name="ACF"/&gt; Many psychological disorders have a window of vulnerability, during which time an individual is more likely to develop disorder than others.&lt;ref name="Barlow"/&gt;    Diathesis–stress models are often conceptualized as multi-causal developmental models, which propose that multiple risk factors over the course of development interact with stressors and protective factors contributing to normal development or psychopathology.&lt;ref name="Masten"/&gt;  The [[differential susceptibility hypothesis]] is a recent theory that has stemmed from the diathesis–stress model.&lt;ref name="Belsky"/&gt;

==Diathesis==
The term diathesis is synonymous with [[vulnerability]], and variants such as "vulnerability-stress" are common within psychology.&lt;ref name="Sigelman"/&gt; A [[vulnerability]] makes it more or less likely that an individual will succumb to the development of [[psychopathology]] if a certain stress is encountered.&lt;ref name="Ingram"/&gt;   Diatheses are considered inherent within the individual and are typically conceptualized as being stable, but not unchangeable, over the lifespan.&lt;ref name="Oatleyb"&gt;Oatley, K., Keltner, D. &amp; Jenkins, J. M. (2006b). "Emotions and mental health in childhood."''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RGHghPqIO_8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Understanding+emotions+2nd+ed&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rl_HUMGGB6jh0wGwyoDYBg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA Understanding emotions]'' (2nd ed.) (pp. 321-351). Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ormel2013"/&gt; They are also often considered latent (i.e. dormant), because they are harder to recognize unless provoked by stressors.&lt;ref name="Ingram"/&gt;

Diatheses are understood to include [[Heredity|genetic]], [[biological]], [[physiological]], [[cognitive]], and [[personality]]-related factors.&lt;ref name="Sigelman"/&gt; Some examples of diatheses include genetic factors, such as abnormalities in some genes or variations in multiple genes that interact to increase vulnerability. Other diatheses include early life experiences such as the loss of a parent,&lt;ref name="Oatleya"/&gt; or high neuroticism.&lt;ref name="NeuroticismMA"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jeronimus B.F.|author2=Kotov, R.|author3=Riese, H.|author4=Ormel, J.| year = 2016 | title = Neuroticism's prospective association with mental disorders halves after adjustment for baseline symptoms and psychiatric history, but the adjusted association hardly decays with time: a meta-analysis on 59 longitudinal/prospective studies with 443 313 participants | journal = Psychological Medicine | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033291716001653 | doi=10.1017/S0033291716001653 | pmid=27523506 | volume=46 | pages=2883–2906}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Diatheses can also be conceptualized as situational factors, such as low [[socio-economic status]] or having a parent with depression.

==Stress==
Stress can be conceptualized as a life event that disrupts the equilibrium of a person's life.&lt;ref name="Oatleyb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jeronimus, B.F. |author2=Ormel, J. |author3=Aleman, A. |author4=Penninx, B.W.J.H. |author5=Riese, H. |journal=Psychological Medicine|year= 2013|volume=43|issue=11|pages=2403–15|title= Negative and positive life events are associated with small but lasting change in neuroticism|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033291713000159|doi=10.1017/s0033291713000159 |pmid=23410535}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a person may be vulnerable to become depressed, but will not develop depression unless he or she is exposed to a specific stress, which may trigger a depressive disorder.&lt;ref name="Nolen"&gt;Nolen-Hoeksema, S. (2008). "Suicide". ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wYIsQAAACAAJ&amp;dq=nolen-hoeksema+abnormal+psychology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dHrHUIT4Iee80QHY1YDgCg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA Abnormal Psychology]'' (4th ed.) (pp. 350-373). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stressors can take the form of a discrete event, such the [[divorce]] of parents or a [[death]] in the family, or can be more chronic factors such as having a [[chronic illness|long-term illness]], or ongoing marital problems.&lt;ref name="Oatleya"/&gt; Stresses can also be related to more daily hassles such as school assignment deadlines. This is also parallels the popular (and engineering) usage of stress, but note that some literature defines stress as the [[stress (biology)|response]] to stressors, especially where usage in biology influences neuroscience.

It has been long recognized that stress plays a significant role in understanding how psychopathology develops in individuals.&lt;ref name="Monroe"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Monroe S. M. |author2=Simons A. D. | year = 1991 | title = Diathesis-stress theories in the context of life stress research: Implications for depressive disorders | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1992-05606-001 | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 110 | issue = 3| pages = 406–425 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.110.3.406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, psychologists have also identified that not all individuals who are stressed, or go through stressful life events, develop a psychological disorder.  To understand this, theorists and researchers explored other factors that affect the development of a disorder &lt;ref name="Monroe"/&gt; and proposed that some individuals under stress develop a disorder and others do not.  As such, some individuals are more vulnerable than others to develop a disorder once stress has been introduced.&lt;ref name="Ingram"/&gt; This led to the formulation of the diathesis–stress model.

==Protective factors==
[[Protective factor]]s, while not an inherent component of the diathesis–stress model, are of importance when considering the interaction of diatheses and stress.  Protective factors can mitigate or provide a buffer against the effects of major stressors by providing an individual with developmentally adaptive outlets to deal with stress.&lt;ref name="ACF"&gt;Administration for Children and Families (2012). ''Preventing child maltreatment and promoting well-being: A network for action''. Department of Health and Human Services. Retrieved from http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/guide2012/guide.pdf#page=9&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of protective factors include a positive parent-child [[Attachment theory|attachment relationship]], a supportive peer network, and individual social and emotional competence.&lt;ref name="ACF"/&gt;

==Throughout the lifespan==
Many models of [[psychopathology]] generally suggest that all people have some level of vulnerability towards certain mental disorders, but posit a large range of individual differences in the point at which a person will develop a certain disorder.&lt;ref name="Ingram"/&gt; For example, an individual with personality traits that tend to promote relationships such as [[extroversion]] and [[agreeableness]] may engender strong social support, which may later serve as a protective factor when experiencing stressors or losses that may delay or prevent the development of depression.  Conversely, an individual who finds it difficult to develop and maintain supportive relationships may be more vulnerable to developing depression following a job loss because they do not have protective social support. An individual's threshold is determined by the interaction of diatheses and stress.&lt;ref name="Oatleyb"/&gt;

Windows of vulnerability for developing specific psychopathologies are believed to exist at different points of the lifespan.   Moreover, different diatheses and stressors are implicated in different disorders.   For example, breakups and other severe or traumatic life stressors are implicated in the development of depression.  Stressful events can also trigger the manic phase of [[bipolar disorder]] and stressful events can then prevent recovery and trigger relapse.  Having a genetic disposition for becoming addicted and later engaging in [[binge drinking]] in college are implicated in the development of [[alcoholism]].  A family history of [[schizophrenia]] combined with the stressor of being raised in a dysfunctional family raises the risk of developing schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="Barlow"&gt;Barlow, D. H. &amp; Durand, V. M. (2009). ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=yITxaqlS_yMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT6&amp;dq=Abnormal+psychology:+An+integrative+approach&amp;ots=OwHqAzXsvB&amp;sig=axcuq5OQ9jOIZJNcplsKQUsiZgc Abnormal psychology: An integrative approach.]'' Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diathesis–stress models are often conceptualized as multi-causal developmental models, which propose that multiple [[risk factors]] over the course of development interact with stressors and protective factors contributing to normal development or psychopathology.&lt;ref name="Masten"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Masten A. S. | year = 2001 | title = Ordinary magic: Resilience processes in development | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/56/3/227/ | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 227–238 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.56.3.227 | pmid=11315249}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For example, a child with a family history of depression likely has a genetic vulnerability to depressive disorder.  This child has also been exposed to environmental factors associated with parental depression that increase his or her vulnerability to developing depression as well.  Protective factors, such as strong peer network, involvement in extracurricular activities, and a positive relationship with the non-depressed parent, interact with the child's vulnerabilities in determining the progression to psychopathology versus normative development.&lt;ref name="Cummings"&gt;Cummings, M. E., Davies, P. T., &amp; Campbell, S. B. (2000). ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=5SyyeX-yVbAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Developmental+psychopathology+and+family+process:+Theory,+research,+and+clinical+implications&amp;ots=qywEE0b9c1&amp;sig=YQ92AoXpIsmgYc2-cVCx1Gsal30 Developmental psychopathology and family process: Theory, research, and clinical implications.]'' New York, NY: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theories have branched from the diathesis–stress model, such as the [[differential susceptibility hypothesis]], which extends the model to include a vulnerability to  positive environments as well as negative environments or stress.&lt;ref name="Belsky"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Belsky J. |author2=Pluess M. | year = 2009 | title = Beyond diathesis stress: Differential susceptibility to environmental influences | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/135/6/885/ | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 135 | issue = 6| pages = 885–908 | doi = 10.1037/a0017376 | pmid=19883141}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A person could have a biological vulnerability that when combined with a stressor could lead to psychopathology (diathesis–stress model); but that same person with a biological vulnerability, if exposed to a particularly positive environment, could have better outcomes than a person without the vulnerability.&lt;ref name="Belsky"/&gt;

The '''Disruptive Behavior Disorders Rating Scale (DBDRS)''' is a 45-question screening measure, completed by either parents or teachers, designed to identify symptoms of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[oppositional defiant disorder]], and [[conduct disorder]] in children and adolescents.

For each question, the respondent is asked to indicate the degree to which a statement describes the child’s behavior. Response options include “not at all”, “just a little”, “pretty much”, and “very much”. For any question they do not know the answer to, respondents are asked to write “DK” for “don’t know”. The behavioral rating scale takes 5–10 minutes to complete and is designed for use with children ages 5 and up. The scores of the scale have been shown to be [[reliability (research methods)|reliable]] and [[test validity|valid]] across multiple different study samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman-Weieneth|first1=JL|last2=Doctoroff|first2=GL|last3=Harvey|first3=EA|last4=Goldstein|first4=LH|title=The Disruptive Behavior Rating Scale-Parent Version (DBRS-PV): Factor analytic structure and validity among young preschool children.|journal=Journal of Attention Disorders|date=July 2009|volume=13|issue=1|pages=42–55|pmid=18753403|doi=10.1177/1087054708322991}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 July 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silva|first1=RR|last2=Alpert|first2=M|last3=Pouget|first3=E|last4=Silva|first4=V|last5=Trosper|first5=S|last6=Reyes|first6=K|last7=Dummit|first7=S|title=A rating scale for disruptive behavior disorders, based on the DSM-IV item pool.|journal=The Psychiatric quarterly|date=2005|volume=76|issue=4|pages=327–39|pmid=16217627|doi=10.1007/s11126-005-4966-x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 July 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

EDC solutions are widely adopted by pharmaceutical companies and [[contract research organization]]s (CRO).

Typically, EDC systems provide:
* a [[graphical user interface]] component for data entry
* a [[Data validation|validation]] component to check user data
* a [[report]]ing tool for analysis of the collected data

EDC systems are used by life sciences organizations, broadly defined as the pharmaceutical, medical device and [[biotechnology]] industries in all aspects of clinical research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sas.com/news/feature/hls/sep05edc.html |title=Electronic Data Capture: When Will It Replace Paper? |author=David Handelsman |publisher=''[[SAS Institute Inc.]]'' |accessdate=2010-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217165516/http://www.sas.com/news/feature/hls/sep05edc.html |archivedate=2009-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but are particularly beneficial for late-phase (phase III-IV) studies and [[pharmacovigilance]] and [[Postmarketing surveillance|post-market safety surveillance]].

EDC can increase the data accuracy and decrease the time to collect data for studies of drugs and [[medical device]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dreamslab.it/dlab/media/docs/eclinica.pdf |title=Comparison of Electronic Data Capture with Paper Data Collection – Is There Really an Advantage? |author=Thomas Bart |publisher=''[[Business Briefing, Pharmatech]]'' |accessdate=2013-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903072213/http://www.dreamslab.it/dlab/media/docs/eclinica.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trade-off that many drug developers encounter with deploying an EDC system to support their drug development is that there is a relatively high start-up process, followed by significant benefits over the duration of the trial. As a result, for an EDC to be economical the saving over the life of the trial must be greater than the set-up costs. This is often aggravated by two conditions:

#that initial design of the study in EDC does not facilitate the decrease in costs over the life of the study due to poor planning or inexperience with EDC deployment; and
#initial set-up costs are higher than anticipated due to initial design of the study in EDC due to poor planning or experience with EDC deployment. 

The net effect is to increase both the cost and risk to the study with insignificant benefits. However, with the maturation of today's EDC solutions, much of the earlier burdens for study design and set-up have been alleviated through technologies that allow for [[point-and-click]], and [[drag-and-drop]] design modules. With little to no programming required, and reusability from global libraries and standardized forms such as CDISC's CDASH, deploying EDC can now rival the paper processes in terms of study start-up time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0025348|title=Comparison of Electronic Data Capture (EDC) with the Standard Data Capture Method for Clinical Trial Data |author1=Brigitte Walther |author2=Safayet Hossin |author3=John Townend |author4=Neil Abernethy |author5=David Parker |author6=David Jeffries |publisher=''[[PLOS ONE]]''|accessdate=2013-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, even the earlier phase studies have begun to adopt EDC technology.

==History==
EDC is often cited as having its origins in [[remote data entry]] (RDE) software, which surfaced in the life sciences market in the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref name="HydeTheChanging98"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Changing Face of Electronic Data Capture: From Remote Data Entry to Direct Data Capture |journal=Therapeutic Innovation &amp; Regulatory Science |author=Hyde, A.W. |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=1089–1092 |year=1998 |doi=10.1177/009286159803200429}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its origins might be tracked to a contract research organization known then as Institute for Biological Research and Development (IBRD). Dr. Nichol, Pickering, and Bollert offered "a controlled system for post-marketing surveillance (PMS) of newly approved (NDA) pharmaceutical products," with surveillance data being "entered into an electronic data base on site" at least as early as 1980.&lt;ref name="NicholPost80"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Post-marketing surveillance of approved pharmaceuticals in the United States |journal=Contemporary Clinical Trials |author1=Nichol, F.R.|author2=Pickering, B.I.|author3=Bollert, J.A. |volume=1 |issue=2 |page=178 |year=1980 |doi=10.1016/0197-2456(80)90061-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical research data—patient data collected during the investigation of a new drug or medical device is collected by physicians, nurses, and research study coordinators in medical settings (offices, hospitals, universities) throughout the world. Historically, this information was collected on paper forms which were then sent to the research sponsor (e.g., a pharmaceutical company) for data entry into a database and subsequent statistical analysis environment.&lt;ref name="WaltherComp11"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Comparison of Electronic Data Capture (EDC) with the Standard Data Capture Method for Clinical Trial Data |journal=PLOS One |author1=Walther, B. |author2=Hossin, S. |author3=Townend, J. |display-authors=et al |volume=6 |issue=9 |page=e25348 |year=2011 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0025348}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WaterfieldData00"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4AmqdhL6ElEC&amp;pg=PA75 |chapter=Chapter 4: Data Capture |title=Clinical Data Management |author=Waterfield, E. |editor1=Rondel, R.K.|editor2=Varley, S.A.|editor3=Webb, C.F. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=75–88 |year=2000 |isbn=9780471983293 |accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HamadHealth17" /&gt; However, this process had a number of shortcomings&lt;ref name="HydeTheChanging98" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaterfieldData00" /&gt;:

* data are copied multiple times, which produces errors
* errors that are generated are not caught until weeks later
* visibility into the medical status of patients by sponsors is delayed

To address these and other concerns, RDE systems were invented so that physicians, nurses, and study coordinators could enter the data directly at the medical setting.  By moving data entry out of the sponsor site and into the clinic or other facility, a number of benefits could be derived&lt;ref name="HydeTheChanging98" /&gt;:

* data checks could be implemented during data entry (real-time), preventing some errors altogether and immediately prompting for resolution of other errors
* data could be transmitted nightly to sponsors, thereby improving the sponsor's ability to monitor the progress and status of the research study and its patients

These early RDE systems used "[[thick client]]" software—software installed locally on a laptop computer's hardware—to collect the patient data. The system could then use a modem connection over an analog phone line to periodically transmit the data back to the sponsor, and to collect questions from the sponsor that the medical staff would need to answer.&lt;ref name="HydeTheChanging98" /&gt;

Though effective, RDE brought with it several shortcomings as well. The most significant shortcoming was that hardware (e.g., a laptop computer) needed to be deployed, installed, and supported at every investigational (medical) site.&lt;ref name="WaterfieldData00" /&gt; This became expensive for sponsors and complicated for medical staff. Usability and space constraints led to a lot of dissatisfaction among medical practitioners. With the rise of the internet in the mid-1990s, the obvious solution to some of these issues was the adoption of web-based software that could be accessed using existing computers at the investigational sites. EDC represents this new class of software.

==Current landscape==
The EDC landscape has continued to evolve from its evolution from RDE in the late 1990s. Today, the market consists of a variety of new and established software providers. Many of these providers offer specialized solutions targeting certain customer profiles or study phases. Modern features of EDC now include features like cloud data storage, role-based permissions, and case report form designers&lt;ref name="HamadHealth17" /&gt;, as well as clinical trials analytics, interactive dashboards, and [[electronic medical record]] integration.&lt;ref name="GicqueauEvo15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clincapture.com/blog/evolution-in-the-electronic-data-capture-industry/ |title=Evolution in the electronic data capture industry |author=Gicqueau, A. |publisher=ClinCapture |date=19 February 2015 |accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
In 2013, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) introduced its eSource guidance, which suggests methods of capturing clinical trial data electronically from the very beginning and moving it to the cloud, as opposed to EDC's more traditional method of capturing data initially on paper and transcribing it into the EDC system.&lt;ref name="NeuerAtThe15"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.clinicalink.com/assets/ICTNOV2015.pdf |format=PDF |title=At the Source |work=International Clinical Trials |author=Neuer, A. |pages=40–44 |date=November 2015 |accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KellarOptim16"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Optimizing the Use of Electronic Data Sources in Clinical Trials: The Landscape, Part 1 |journal=Therapeutic Innovation &amp; Regulatory Science |author1=Kellar, E. |author2=Bornstein, S.M. |author3=Caban, A. |display-authors=et al |volume=50 |issue=6 |pages=682-696 |year=2016 |doi=10.1177/2168479016670689 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adoption of eSource was initially slow, with the FDA producing a webinar in July 2015 to further promote the guidance.&lt;ref name="NeuerAtThe15" /&gt; Efforts like the TransCelerate eSource Initiative (in 2016) have been founded "to facilitate the understanding of the eSource landscape and the optimal use of electronic data sources in the industry to improve global clinical science and global clinical trial execution for stakeholders."&lt;ref name="KellarOptim16" /&gt; A 2017 study by the [[Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development]] suggested that with the following three years a "majority of [surveyed clinical information] companies" (growing from 38 percent to 84 percent) planned to incorporate eSource data.&lt;ref name="BWIndustry17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171107005745/en/Industry-Research-Shows-97-Companies-Increase-Real-world |title=Industry Research Shows 97% of Companies to Increase Use of Real-world Patient Data for More Accurate Decision-making |work=Business Wire |date=7 November 2017 |accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 87 percent of research sites (2017) stating that eSource would be "helpful" or "very helpful" if integrated with today's EDC&lt;ref name="NomlzuGetting17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.clinicalresearch.io/news/getting-your-site-ready-for-esource |title=Getting Your Site Ready for eSource |work=InSite |author=Nomlzu, R. |publisher=CRIO |date=29 September 2017 |accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a shift away from EDC (or EDC taking a more complementary role) may be possible.

The '''European Union of Medical Specialists''' (UEMS: Union Européenne des Médecins Spécialistes) is a professional organisation of doctors other than general practitioners in the European Union, which was founded in 1958.  This union represents about 1.4 million specialists.{{sfn|Bisdorff|2012}}

The National Medical Associations of the countries in the [[European Union]] and [[European Economic Area]] are full members of the European Union of Medical Specialists, and provide delegates to the governing council.{{sfn|Bisdorff|2012}} Fifty medical disciplines are represented, of which the most important are covered by 43 specialist sections for areas such as Allergology, Anaesthesiology, Cardiology, Cardiothoracic Surgery, and more. {{sfn|https://www.uems.eu/about-us/medical-specialties||p=}} The European Union of Medical Specialists represents medical specialists to the EU authorities. It promotes high levels of medical training, practice, and health care.

The European Union of Medical Specialists is responsible for accreditation of Continuing Medical Education through the EACCME.{{sfn|Bisdorff|2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4009">'''For-profit hospitals''', sometimes referred to as alternatively investor-owned hospitals, are [[investor]]-owned chains of [[hospital]]s. Many of the For-profit hospitals are located in Europe and [[North America]], with many of them established particularly in the [[United States]] during the late twentieth century. In contrast to the traditional and more common [[non-profit hospital]]s, they attempt to garner a profit for their shareholders. The highest charging hospitals in the US are for profit, according to a study published in the journal ''[[Health Affairs]]'' in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Gold (June 9, 2015). [https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/06/09/412964072/highest-charging-u-s-hospitals-are-for-profit-and-concentrated-in-florida Highest-Charging U.S. Hospitals Are For-Profit And Concentrated In Florida]. ''[[NPR]].'' Retrieved June 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, the three largest such firms are [[Hospital Corporation of America]], [[Tenet Healthcare|Tenet]] (formerly [[NME]]), and [[HealthSouth]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  HealthSouth, as the third-largest U.S. national chain, is also the leading provider of rehabilitation services. For profit [[Psychiatric Solutions]] is the largest provider of psychiatric services in the nation.

A conceptually related institution is the for-profit [[HMO]], which now comprises the predominant means of delivering [[medical services]] in the [[United States]]. Advocates of such institutions claim they are able to provide better care at lower [[cost]] due to higher efficiency. It is also said that, in the free market, hospitals have an incentive to do better due to competition.

Detractors, however, claim that the relative success of for-profit medical providers arises from their positioning themselves in the medical marketplace in such a manner as to offer mainly profitable care services for a largely affluent and insured clientele whilst avoiding unprofitable care areas. Critics thus claim, for example, that for-profit hospitals specialize in such highly lucrative fields as [[physical medicine and rehabilitation|medical rehabilitation]], elective/plastic surgery, and [[cardiology]] while avoiding provision of loss-making services such as [[emergency medicine]] which in turn caters mainly to the indigent.  Analogously, critics of for-profit HMOs argue that such firms disproportionately insure healthy people, while simultaneously eschewing chronically ill patients, who must then by default be cared for disproportionately by public insurance schemes and non-profit providers—thus a so-called "dumping" of undesirable patients.

==Canada==
They have also been criticised by elements of the Canadian medical establishment as providing inferior care at higher cost. See [http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/170/12/1814 this commentary] in the ''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]'' and [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/341/6/444?ijkey=eb607342c04dc1375af6d51723667fcae5df896c&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha this editorial] in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]''.

==India==
For-profit hospitals in [[India]] have recently come under increasing media scrutiny. In an article by the ''[[Huffington Post]]'', they spoke about the problems with "corporate hospitals" and senior surgeons being told to sell surgeries to their patients even if they weren't needed. In one instance, a doctor was told he would be sacked if he didn't have enough patients to operate on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chandran|first1=Prabha|title=Exclusive: Doctors And Hospitals Are Playing With Lives For Profit, Say Authors Of Medical Exposé|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/prabha-chandran/expose-indias-ailing-heal_b_9792552.html|date=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francis Mitchell Caird''' FRCSE (8 August 1853–2 November1926) was a Scottish surgeon who served as Regius Professor of Clinical Surgery at the [[University of Edinburgh]] from 1908 to 1919.&lt;ref name="ed"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ed.ac.uk/files/imports/fileManager/History%20of%20the%20Chair%20of%20Clinical%20Surgery.pdf|date=2011-01-21|title=History of the Chair of Clinical Surgery |accessdate=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caird was educated at the [[Royal High School, Edinburgh|Royal High School]]. He then studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh under eminent surgeons including [[Joseph Lister]] and [[Thomas Annandale]].

While an undergraduate he served as a dresser on [[Joseph Lister|Joseph Lister's]]' wards at the [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]] &lt;ref name="rcsed"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://library.rcsed.ac.uk/media/1288/gd45-album-of-original-drawings-for-caird-and-cathcart-surgical-handbook.pdf|date=2009-04-15|title= Francis Mitchell Caird &amp; Charles Walker Cathcart|accessdate=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also as an assistant in [[botany]] to [[John Hutton Balfour]].&lt;ref name="nih"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Francis Mitchell Caird, M.B., C.M., F.R.C.S.E., LL.D|accessdate=| pmc=406913|pages=127–128|volume=17|issue=1|journal=Can Med Assoc J|year=927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article provides a brief overview of the health systems of the world, sorted by continent.

==Africa==

===Algeria===
{{Main article|Health in Algeria}}

When Algeria gained its independence from France in 1962, there were only around 300 doctors across the whole country and no proper system of healthcare. Over the next few decades, great progress was made in building up the health sector, with the training of doctors and the creation of many health facilities. Today, Algeria has an established network of hospitals (including university hospitals), clinics, medical centres and small health units or dispensaries. While equipment and medicines may not always be the latest available, staffing levels are high and the country has one of the best healthcare systems in Africa. Access to health care is enhanced by the requirement that doctors and dentists work in [[public health]] for at least five years. The government provides [[universal health care]].

===Cape Verde===
{{Main article|Health in Cape Verde}}

Medical facilities in [[Cape Verde]] are limited, and some medicines are in short supply or unavailable.  There are hospitals in [[Praia]] and [[Mindelo]], with smaller medical facilities in other places.  The islands of [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]] and [[Santo Antão, Cape Verde|Santo Antão]] no longer have functioning airports so air evacuation in the event of a medical emergency is nearly impossible from these two islands.  Brava also has limited inter-island ferry service.&lt;ref name=us&gt;[[United States Department of State]], [https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1083.html "Cape Verde: Country Specific Information"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125120707/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1083.html# |date=25 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eritrea===
{{Main article|Health in Eritrea}}

Eritrea is one of the few countries to be on target to meet its Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets for health. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have identified the high prioritisation of health and education both within the government and amongst Eritreans at home and abroad. Innovative multi-sectoral approaches to health were also identified with the success. About one-third of the population lives in extreme [[poverty]], and more than half survives on less than US$1 per day.  Health care and welfare resources generally are believed to be poor, although reliable information about conditions is often difficult to obtain. In 2001, the most recent year for which figures are available, the Eritrean government spent 5.7 percent of [[gross domestic product]] on national health accounts. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimated that in 2004 there were only three physicians per 100,000 people in [[Eritrea]]. The two-year war with [[Ethiopia]], coming on the heels of a 30-year struggle for independence, negatively affected the health sector and the general welfare. The rate of prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome ([[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]), in Eritrea is believed to be at 0.7%(2012)which is reasonably low. In the decade since 1995, impressive results have been achieved in lowering maternal and [[child mortality]] rates and in immunizing children against childhood diseases. In 2008 average life expectancy was slightly less than 63 years, according to the WHO. Immunisation and child nutrition has been tackled by working closely with schools in a multi-sectoral approach; the number of children vaccinated against measles almost doubled in seven years, from 40.7% to 78.5% and the underweight prevalence among children decreased by 12% in 1995–2002 (severe underweight prevalence by 28%). This has helped to some small extent even out rural-urban and rich-poor inequity in health.

===Ethiopia===
{{Main article|Health in Ethiopia}}

Throughout the 1990s, the government, as part of its reconstruction program, devoted ever-increasing amounts of funding to the social and health sectors, which brought corresponding improvements in school enrollments, adult [[literacy]], and [[infant mortality rate]]s. These expenditures stagnated or declined during the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War|1998–2000 war with Eritrea]], but in the years since, outlays for health have grown steadily. In 2000–2001, the budget allocation for the health sector was approximately US$144 million; health expenditures per capita were estimated at US$4.50, compared with US$10 on average in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2000 the country counted one hospital bed per 4,900 population and more than 27,000 people per primary health care facility. The [[physician]] to population ratio was 1:48,000, the [[nurse]] to population ratio, 1:12,000. Overall, there were 20 trained health providers per 100,000 inhabitants. These ratios have since shown some improvement. Health care is disproportionately available in urban centers; in rural areas where the vast majority of the population resides, access to health care varies from limited to nonexistent. As of the end of 2003, the [[United Nations]] (UN) reported that 4.4 percent of adults were infected with [[human immunodeficiency virus]]/[[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (HIV/AIDS); other estimates of the rate of infection ranged from a low of 7 percent to a high of 18 percent. Whatever the actual rate, the [[HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia|prevalence of HIV/AIDS]] has contributed to falling life expectancy since the early 1990s. According to the [[Ministry of Health (Ethiopia)|Ministry of Health]], one-third of current young adult deaths are AIDS-related. [[Malnutrition]] is widespread, especially among children, as is [[food insecurity]]. Because of growing population pressure on agricultural and pastoral land, soil degradation, and severe droughts that have occurred each decade since the 1970s, per capita food production is declining. According to the UN and the [[World Bank]], Ethiopia at present suffers from a structural food deficit such that even in the most productive years, at least 5 million Ethiopians require food relief.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

In 2002 the government embarked on a poverty reduction program that called for outlays in education, health, sanitation, and water. A [[polio]] [[vaccination]] campaign for 14 million children has been carried out, and a program to [[Resettlement and villagization in Ethiopia|resettle]] some 2 million subsistence farmers is underway. In November 2004, the government launched a five-year program to expand primary health care. In January 2005, it began distributing [[antiretroviral drugs]], hoping to reach up to 30,000 HIV-infected adults.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

===Ghana===
{{Main article|Health in Ghana}}

In [[Ghana]], most health care is provided by the government, but hospitals and clinics run by religious groups also play an important role.  Some for-profit clinics exist, but they provide less than 2% of health services.  Health care is very variable through the country.  The major urban centres are well served, but rural areas often have no modern health care.  Patients in these areas either rely on traditional medicine or travel great distances for care. In 2005, Ghana spent 6.2% of GDP on health care, or US$30 per capita. Of that, approximately 34% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

===Guinea===
{{see also|Guinea#Health}}

[[Guinea]] has been reorganizing its health system since the [[Bamako Initiative]] of 1987 formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of [[primary health care]] to the population, including community ownership and local budgeting, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of drugs and other essential health care resources.&lt;ref&gt;Knippenberg R et al. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10173105?dopt=Abstract "Implementation of the Bamako Initiative: strategies in Benin and Guinea."] ''Int J Health Plann Manage''. 1997 Jun;12 Suppl 1:S29-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the Guinean government announced the establishment of an air ticket solidarity levy on all flights taking off from national soil, with funds going to [[UNITAID]] to support expanded access to treatment for [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]] and [[malaria]].&lt;ref name="UNITAID"&gt;UNITAID. [http://www.unitaid.eu/en/resources/news/347-republic-of-guinea-introduces-air-solidarity-levy-to-fight-aids-tb-and-malaria.html ''Republic of Guinea Introduces Air Solidarity Levy to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112114051/http://www.unitaid.eu/en/resources/news/347-republic-of-guinea-introduces-air-solidarity-levy-to-fight-aids-tb-and-malaria.html# |date=12 November 2011 }} Geneva, 30 June 2011. Accessed 5 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Guinea is among the growing number of countries and development partners using market-based transactions taxes and other [[innovative financing]] mechanisms to expand financing options for health care in resource-limited settings.

===Mali===
{{Main article|Health in Mali}}

Health in [[Mali]], one of the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|world’s poorest nations]], is greatly affected by [[poverty]], [[malnutrition]], and inadequate [[hygiene]] and [[sanitation]]. Mali's health and development indicators rank among the worst in the world. In 2000 only 62–65 percent of the population was estimated to have access to safe drinking water and only 69 percent to sanitation services of some kind; only 8 percent was estimated to have access to modern sanitation facilities. Only 20 percent of the nation’s villages and livestock watering holes had modern water facilities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Mali.pdf Mali country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (January 2005). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

Mali is dependent on international development organizations and foreign missionary groups for much of its health care. In 2001 general government expenditures on health constituted 6.8 percent of total general government expenditures and 4.3 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), totaling only about US$4 per capita at an average exchange rate. Medical facilities in Mali are very limited, especially outside of [[Bamako]], and medicines are in short supply. There were only 5 [[physicians]] per 100,000 inhabitants in the 1990s and 24 hospital beds per 100,000 in 1998. In 1999 only 36 percent of Malians were estimated to have access to health services within a five-kilometer radius.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

===Morocco===
{{Main article|Health in Morocco}}

According to the United States government, [[Morocco]] has inadequate numbers of [[physicians]] (0.5 per 1,000 people) and hospital beds (1.0 per 1,000 people) and poor access to [[water]] (82 percent of the population) and [[sanitation]] (75 percent of the population). The health care system includes 122 hospitals, 2,400 health centers, and 4 university clinics, but they are poorly maintained and lack adequate capacity to meet the demand for medical care. Only 24,000 beds are available for 6 million patients seeking care each year, including 3 million emergency cases. The health budget corresponds to 1.1 percent of [[gross domestic product]] and 5.5 percent of the central government budget.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Morocco.pdf Morocco country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (May 2006). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Niger===
{{Main article|Health in Niger}}

Health care system of [[Niger]] suffers from a chronic lack of resources and a small number of health providers relative to population. Some medicines are in short supply or unavailable.  There are government hospitals in [[Niamey]] (with three main hospitals in Niamey, including the ''Hôpital National de Niamey'' and the ''Hôpital National De Lamordé''), [[Maradi, Niger|Maradi]], [[Tahoua]], [[Zinder]] and other large cities, with smaller medical clinics in most towns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stone-env.com/docs/atlases/NigerPrelimPov/Map8.pdf REPUBLIC OF NIGER PRELIMINARY ATLAS OF POVERTY/VULNERABILITY. MAP 8: VILLAGES WITH CLINICS/HOSPITALS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213133829/http://www.stone-env.com/docs/atlases/NigerPrelimPov/Map8.pdf |date=13 February 2012 }}. Prepared for The World Bank Technical Department, Africa Region. 6 March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Medical facilities are limited in both supplies and staff, with a small government health care system supplemented by private, charitable, religious, and Non-government organisation operated clinics and public health programs (such as [[Galmi Hospital]] near Birnin Konni and Maradi). Government hospitals, as well as [[public health]] programmes, fall under the control of the [[Nigerien Ministry of Health]]. A number of private for profit clinics ("''Cabinets Médical Privé''") operate in Niamey. The total expenditure on health per capita in 2005 was Intl $25.  There were 377 [[Physicians]] in Niger in 2004, a ratio of 0.03 per 10,000 population.  In 2003, 89.2 percent of individual expenditures on health care were "out-of-pocket" (paid by the patient).&lt;ref name=who2006&gt;[http://www.afro.who.int/home/countries/fact_sheets/niger.pdf Niger. Country Health System Fact Sheet, 2006] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107110212/http://www.afro.who.int/home/countries/fact_sheets/niger.pdf# |date=7 January 2010 }}. [[World Health Organization]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===
{{Main article|Health in Nigeria}}

Health care provision in [[Nigeria]] is a [[wikt:concurrent|concurrent]] responsibility of the three tiers of government in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Rais Akhtar; Health Care Patterns and Planning in Developing Countries, Greenwood Press, 1991. pp 264&lt;/ref&gt; However, because Nigeria operates a [[mixed economy]], private providers of health care have a visible role to play in health care delivery. The [[Politics of Nigeria|federal government]]'s role is mostly limited to coordinating the affairs of the [[university]] [[teaching hospital]]s, while the state government manages the various [[hospital|general hospitals]] and the [[local government]] focus on [[dispensaries]]. The total expenditure on health care as % of GDP is 4.6, while the percentage of federal government expenditure on health care is about 1.5%.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald J. Vogel; Financing Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa Greenwood Press, 1993. pp 18&lt;/ref&gt; A [[long run]] indicator of the ability of the country to provide food sustenance and avoid [[malnutrition]] is the rate of growth of per capita food production; from 1970 to 1990, the rate for Nigeria was 0.25%.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald J. Vogel; Financing Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa Greenwood Press, 1993. pp 1-18&lt;/ref&gt; Though small, the positive rate of per capita may be due to Nigeria's importation of food products. Historically, health insurance in Nigeria can be applied to a few instances: government-paid health care provided and financed for all citizens, health care provided by government through a special health insurance scheme for government employees and private firms entering contracts with private health care providers.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald J. Vogel; Financing Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa Greenwood Press, 1993. pp 101-102&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are few people who fall within the three instances. In May 1999, the government created the [[National Health Insurance]] Scheme, the scheme encompasses government employees, the organized [[private sector]] and the informal sector. Legislative wise, the scheme also covers children under five, permanently disabled persons and prison inmates. In 2004, the administration of Obasanjo further gave more legislative powers to the scheme with positive amendments to the original 1999 legislative act.&lt;ref&gt;Felicia Monye; 'An Appraisal of the National Health Insurance Scheme of [[Nigeria]]', Commonwealth Law Bulletin, 32:3 415-427&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senegal===
{{Main article|Health in Senegal}}

The health budget in Senegal has tripled between 1980 and 2000, leading to the Senegalese people leading healthier and longer lives – the life expectancy at birth is approximately 55.34 years for men, 58.09 years for women, and 56.69 years for the entire population. Also, the prevalence rate of AIDS in Senegal is one of the lowest in Africa, at 0.9%. However, large disparities still exist in Senegal's health coverage, with 70% of doctors, and 80% of pharmacists and dentists, living in the nation's capital city, Dakar.

===South Africa===
{{Main article|Health in South Africa}}

In [[South Africa]], parallel private and public systems exist.  The public system serves the vast majority of the population, but is chronically underfunded and understaffed.  The wealthiest 20% of the population uses the private system and are far better served.  This division in substantial ways perpetuates racial inequalities created in the pre-apartheid segregation era and apartheid era of the 20th century. In 2005, South Africa spent 8.7% of GDP on health care, or US$437 per capita. Of that, approximately 42% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

===Sudan===
{{Main article|Health in Sudan}}

Outside urban areas, little health care is available in [[Sudan]], helping account for a relatively low average [[life expectancy]] of 57 years and an [[infant mortality]] rate of 69 deaths per 1,000 live births, low by standards in Middle Eastern but not African countries. For most of the period since independence in 1956, Sudan has experienced [[civil war]], which has diverted resources to military use that otherwise might have gone into health care and training of professionals, many of whom have migrated in search of more gainful employment. In 1996 the [[World Health Organization]] estimated that there were only 9 doctors per 100,000 people, most of them in regions other than the South. Substantial percentages of the population lack access to safe water and sanitary facilities. [[Malnutrition]] is widespread outside the central Nile corridor because of population displacement from war and from recurrent droughts; these same factors together with a scarcity of medicines make diseases difficult to control. Child immunization against most major childhood diseases, however, had risen to approximately 60 percent by the late 1990s from very low rates in earlier decades. Spending on health care is quite low – only 1 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 1998 (latest data). The [[United Nations]] placed the rate of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome ([[HIV/AIDS]]) infection in late 2003 at 2.3 percent for adults, quite low by regional standards. The United Nations suggested, however, that the rate could be as high as 7.2 percent. Between 400,000 and 1.3 million adults and children were living with HIV, and AIDS deaths numbered 23,000. As of late 2004, some 4 million persons in the South had been internally displaced and more than 2 million had died or been killed as a result of two decades of war. Comparable figures for [[Darfur]] were 1.6 million displaced and 70,000 dead since fighting began there in early 2003.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Sudan.pdf Sudan country profile].

===Zimbabwe===
{{Main article|Health in Zimbabwe}}

Zimbabwe now has one of the lowest life expectancies on Earth – 44 for men and 43 for women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/socind/health.htm|title=United Nations Statistics Division|accessdate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; down from 60 in 1990. The rapid drop has been ascribed mainly to the [[HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe|HIV/AIDS pandemic]]. [[Infant mortality]] has risen from 59 per thousand in the late 1990s to 123 per 1000 by 2004.&lt;ref name=nofix&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7346042.stm|title=No quick fix for Zimbabwe's economy |date=14 April 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The health system has more or less collapsed: By the end of November 2008, three of Zimbabwe's four major [[hospital]]s had shut down, along with the Zimbabwe [[Medical School]] and the fourth major hospital had two [[wikt:ward|wards]] and no [[operating theatre]]s working.&lt;ref name=hospitals&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7714892.stm|title=The death throes of Harare's hospitals|date=7 November 2008|publisher=BBC |accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to [[Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe|hyperinflation]], those hospitals still open are not able to obtain basic drugs and [[medicine]]s.&lt;ref name=coping&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/zimbabwe-feature-261108?opendocument|title=Zimbabwe: coping with the cholera outbreak|date=26 November 2008|publisher=|accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ongoing political and economic crisis also contributed to the [[emigration]] of the doctors and people with medical knowledge.&lt;ref name="Zimbabwe cholera deaths near 500"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7760088.stm|title=Zimbabwe cholera deaths near 500 |date=2 December 2008|publisher=BBC |accessdate=2008-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008, large areas of Zimbabwe were struck by the ongoing [[cholera]] [[epidemic]].

===Afghanistan===
{{Main|Health in Afghanistan}}

Beginning in 1979, [[Soviet–Afghan War|military conflict]] destroyed the [[health]] system of [[Afghanistan]]. Most medical professionals left the country in the 1980s and 1990s, and all medical training programmes ceased.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf Afghanistan country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (May 2006). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 Afghanistan had one medical facility for every 27,000 people, and some centers were responsible for as many as 300,000 people.&lt;ref name=cp /&gt; In 2004 international organizations provided a large share of medical care.&lt;ref name=cp /&gt; An estimated one-quarter of the population had no access to health care.&lt;ref name=cp /&gt; In 2003 there were 11 [[physicians]] and 18 [[nurses]] per 100,000 population, and the per capita health expenditure was US$28.&lt;ref name=cp /&gt;

===Bhutan===
{{Main article|Health in Bhutan}}

[[Bhutan]]'s health care system development accelerated in the early 1960s with the establishment of the Department of Public Health and the opening of new hospitals and dispensaries throughout the country. By the early 1990s, health care was provided through twenty-nine general hospitals (including five leprosy hospitals, three army hospitals, and one mobile hospital), forty-six dispensaries, sixty-seven basic health units, four indigenous-medicine dispensaries, and fifteen [[malaria]] eradication centers. The major hospitals were the [[National Referral Hospital (Thimphu)|National Referral Hospital]] in [[Thimphu]], and other hospitals in [[Geylegphug]], and [[Tashigang]]. Hospital beds in 1988 totaled 932. There was a severe shortage of health care personnel with official statistics reporting only 142 [[physician]]s and 678 [[paramedic]]s, about one health care professional for every 2,000 people, or only one physician for almost 10,000 people. Training for health care assistants, nurses' [[nurse's aide|aides]], [[midwive]]s, and primary health care workers was provided at the [[Royal Institute of Health Sciences (Bhutan)|Royal Institute of Health Sciences]], associated with Thimphu General Hospital, which was established in 1974. Graduates of the school were the core of the national public health system and helped staff the primary care basic health units throughout the country. Additional health care workers were recruited from among volunteers in villages to supplement primary health care.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;Worden, Robert L. "Health".

===China, P.R.===
{{Main|Health in the People's Republic of China}}
{{See also|Health in Hong Kong|Health in Macau}}

The effective public health work in controlling epidemic disease during the early years of the PRC and, after reform began in 1978, the dramatic improvements in nutrition greatly improved the health and life expectancy of the Chinese people. The 2000 WHO [[World Health Report|''World Health Report – Health systems: improving performance'']] found that China's health care system before 1980 performed far better than countries at a comparable level of development, since 1980 ranks much lower than comparable countries.&lt;ref name="WHO2000"&gt;World Health Organization. (2000). ''World Health Report 2000 – Health systems: improving performance.'' Geneva, WHO http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the famed "[[barefoot doctor]]" system was abolished in 1981.

China is undertaking a [[Healthcare system reform in the People's Republic of China|reform on its health care system]]. The New Rural Co-operative Medical Care System (NRCMCS) is a new 2005 initiative to overhaul the health care system, particularly intended to make it more affordable for the rural poor. Under the NRCMCS, the annual cost of medical cover is 50 yuan (US$7) per person. Of that, 20 yuan is paid in by the central government, 20 yuan by the provincial government and a contribution of 10 yuan is made by the patient. As of September 2007, around 80% of the whole rural population of China had signed up (about 685 million people). The system is tiered, depending on the location. If patients go to a small hospital or clinic in their local town, the scheme will cover from 70–80% of their bill. If they go to a county one, the percentage of the cost being covered falls to about 60%. And if they need specialist help in a large modern city hospital, they have to bear most of the cost themselves, the scheme would cover about 30% of the bill.&lt;ref&gt;"The reform of the rural cooperative medical system in the People's Republic of China: interim experience in 14 pilot counties."

Health care was provided in both rural and urban areas through a three-tiered system. In rural areas the first tier was made up of barefoot doctors working out of village medical centers. They provided preventive and primary-care services, with an average of two doctors per 1,000 people. At the next level were the township health centers, which functioned primarily as out-patient clinics for about 10,000 to 30,000 people each. These centers had about ten to thirty beds each, and the most qualified members of the staff were assistant doctors. The two lower-level tiers made up the "rural collective health system" that provided most of the country's medical care. Only the most seriously ill patients were referred to the third and final tier, the county hospitals, which served 200,000 to 600,000 people each and were staffed by senior doctors who held degrees from 5-year [[medical school]]s. Health care in urban areas was provided by paramedical personnel assigned to factories and neighborhood health stations. If more professional care was necessary the patient was sent to a district hospital, and the most serious cases were handled by municipal hospitals. To ensure a higher level of care, a number of state enterprises and government agencies sent their employees directly to district or municipal hospitals, circumventing the paramedical, or barefoot doctor, stage.

===India===
{{Main article|Health in India}}

In [[India]], the hospitals are run by government, charitable trusts and by private organizations. The government hospitals in rural areas are called [[Primary Health Centre]]s (PHCs). Major hospitals are located in district headquarters or major cities. Apart from the modern system of medicine, traditional and indigenous medicinal systems like [[Ayurvedic]] and [[Unani]] systems are in practice throughout the country. The modern system of medicine is regulated by the [[Medical Council of India]], whereas the alternative systems recognised by Government of India are regulated by the Department of [[AYUSH]] (an acronym for [[Ayurveda]], [[Yoga]], [[Unani]], [[Siddha]] &amp; [[Homeopathy]]) under the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India)|Ministry of Health, Government of India]]. PHCs are non-existent in most places, due to poor pay and scarcity of resources. Patients generally prefer private health clinics. These days some of the major corporate hospitals are attracting patients from neighboring countries such as [[Pakistan]], countries in the [[Middle East]] and some [[Europe]]an countries by providing quality treatment at low cost. In 2005, India spent 5% of GDP on health care, or US$36 per capita. Of that, approximately 19% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

Both traditional and modern health practices are employed. A data taken from [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) of 2013 shows that government health expenditures are about 3.1 percent of the total [[gross domestic product]] (GDP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/countries/idn/en/|title=Indonesia|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
{{Main article|Health care in Israel}}

In [[Israel]], the publicly funded medical system is universal and compulsory.  In 2005, Israel spent 7.8% of GDP on health care, or US$1,533 per capita. Of that, approximately 66% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

===Japan===
{{Main|Health in Japan}}

In [[Japan]], services are provided either through regional/national public hospitals or through private hospitals/clinics, and patients have universal access to any facility, though hospitals tend to charge higher for those without a referral.{{Fact|date=January 2018}} Public health insurance covers most citizens/residents and pays 70% or more cost for each care and each prescribed drug. Patients are responsible for the remainder (upper limits apply). The monthly insurance premium is 0–50,000 JPY per household (scaled to annual income). Supplementary private health insurance is available only to cover the co-payments or non-covered costs, and usually makes a fixed payment per days in hospital or per surgery performed, rather than per actual expenditure. In 2005, Japan spent 8.2% of GDP on health care, or US$2,908 per capita. Of that, approximately 83% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

===Jordan===
{{Main article|Health in Jordan}}

In comparison to most of its neighbors, [[Jordan]] has quite an advanced [[health care]] system, although services remain highly concentrated in [[Amman]]. Government figures have put total health spending in 2002 at some 7.5 percent of [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP), while international health organizations place the figure even higher, at approximately 9.3 percent of GDP. The country’s health care system is divided between public and private institutions. In the public sector, the Ministry of Health operates 1,245 primary health care centers and 27 hospitals, accounting for 37 percent of all hospital beds in the country; the military’s Royal Medical Services runs 11 [[hospital]]s, providing 24 percent of all beds; and the [[Jordan University Hospital]] accounts for 3 percent of total beds in the country. The private sector provides 36 percent of all hospital beds, distributed among 56 hospitals. On 1 June 2007, Jordan Hospital (as the biggest private hospital) was the first general specialty hospital who gets the international accreditation (JCI). Treatment cost in Jordan hospitals is less than in other countries.

===Kazakhstan===
{{Main article|Health in Kazakhstan}}

In principle, health care is paid for by the government. However, [[bribes]] often are necessary to obtain needed care. The quality of health care, which remained entirely under state control in 2006, has declined in the post-Soviet era because of insufficient funding and the loss of technical experts through emigration. Between 1989 and 2001, the ratio of [[physician|doctors]] per 10,000 inhabitants fell by 15 percent, to 34.6, and the ratio of hospital beds per 10,000 inhabitants fell by 46 percent, to 74. By 2005 those indicators had recovered somewhat, to 55 and 77, respectively. Since 1991, health care has consistently lacked adequate government funding; in 2005 only 2.5 percent of [[gross domestic product]] went for that purpose. A government health reform program aims to increase that figure to 4 percent in 2010. A compulsory [[health insurance]] system has been in the planning stages for several years. Wages for health workers are extremely low, and equipment is in critically short supply. The main foreign source of medical equipment is Japan. Because of cost, the emphasis of treatment increasingly is on outpatient care instead of the hospital care preferred under the Soviet system. The health system is in crisis in rural areas such as the [[Aral Sea]] region, where health is most affected by [[pollution]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Kazakhstan.pdf Kazakhstancountry profile].

===Malaysia===
{{Main article|Health in Malaysia}}

Health care in [[Malaysia]] is divided into private and public sectors. Doctors are required to undergo a 2-year internship and perform 3 years of service with public hospitals throughout the nation, ensuring adequate coverage of medical needs for the general population. Foreign doctors are encouraged to apply for employment in Malaysia, especially if they are qualified to a higher level.

Malaysian society places importance on the expansion and development of health care, putting 5% of the government social sector development budget into [[Publicly funded health care|public health care]] – an increase of more than 47% over the previous figure. This has meant an overall increase of more than RM 2 billion. With a rising and ageing population, the Government wishes to improve in many areas including the refurbishment of existing hospitals, building and equipping new hospitals, expansion of the number of polyclinics, and improvements in training and expansion of [[telehealth]]. Over the last couple of years they have increased their efforts to overhaul the systems and attract more foreign investment.

There is still a shortage in the medical workforce, especially of highly trained specialists. As a result, certain medical care and treatment is available only in large cities. Recent efforts to bring many facilities to other towns have been hampered by lack of expertise to run the available equipment made ready by investments.

The majority of [[private hospital]] facilities are in urban areas and, unlike many of the public hospitals, are equipped with the latest diagnostic and imaging facilities.

===Oman===
{{Main article|Oman#Health|l1=Health in Oman}}

Oman's healthcare system was ranked at number 8 by the [[World Health Organization ranking of health systems|WHO health systems ranking]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="WHO2000"/&gt; Universal healthcare (including prescriptions and dental care) is provided automatically to all citizens and also to expatriates working in the public sector by the Ministry of Health. Non-eligible individuals such as expatriates working in the private sector and foreign visitors can be treated in the government hospitals and clinics for a reasonable fee or they can opt for the more expensive private clinics and medical centres. The Ministry of Health also finances the treatment of citizens abroad if the required treatment is not available in Oman. The life expectancy in Oman as of 2007 was 71.6. It had 1.81 doctors per 1000 pop., 1.9 beds per 1000 pop. and an infant mortality rate of 9 per 1000 live births. Health expenditure accounts for 4.5% of government revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moh.gov.om/stat/2008/index_eng.htm |title=Annual Health Report |publisher=Moh.gov.om |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404120955/http://www.moh.gov.om/stat/2008/index_eng.htm |archivedate=4 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
{{Main article|Health in Pakistan}}

Pakistan's [[health indicators]], health funding, and health and [[sanitation]] infrastructure are generally poor, particularly in rural areas. About 19 percent of the population is [[malnourished]] – a higher rate than the 17 percent average for developing countries – and 30 percent of children under age five are malnourished. Leading causes of sickness and death include [[gastroenteritis]], [[respiratory infections]], [[congenital abnormalities]], [[tuberculosis]], [[malaria]], and [[typhoid fever]]. The [[United Nations]] estimates that in 2003 Pakistan’s [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) prevalence rate was 0.1 percent among those 15–49, with an estimated 4,900 deaths from acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a major health concern, and both the government and religious community are engaging in efforts to reduce its spread. In 2003 there were 68 physicians for every 100,000 persons in Pakistan. According to 2002 government statistics, there were 12,501 health institutions nationwide, including 4,590 dispensaries, 906 [[hospitals]] with a total of 80,665 hospital beds, and 550 rural health centers with a total of 8,840 beds. According to the [[World Health Organization]], Pakistan’s '''total health expenditures''' amounted to 3.9 percent of gross domestic product ([[GDP]]) in 2001, and per capita health expenditures were US$16. The government provided 24.4 percent of total health expenditures, with the remainder being entirely private, out-of-pocket expenses.

===Philippines===
{{Main article|Health in the Philippines}}

In 2000 the [[Philippines]] had about 95,000 [[physician]]s, or about 1 per 800 people. In 2001 there were about 1,700 [[hospital]]s, of which about 40 percent were government-run and 60 percent private, with a total of about 85,000 beds, or about one bed per 900 people. The leading causes of morbidity as of 2002 were [[diarrhea]], [[bronchitis]], [[pneumonia]], [[influenza]], [[hypertension]], [[tuberculosis]], [[heart disease]], [[malaria]], [[chickenpox]], and [[measles]]. [[Cardiovascular diseases]] account for more than 25 percent of all deaths. According to official estimates, 1,965 cases of [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) were reported in 2003, of which 636 had developed [[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS). Other estimates state that there may have been as many as 9,400 people living with HIV/AIDS in 2001.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Philippines.pdf Philippines country profile].

===Singapore===
{{Main article|Health in Singapore}}

[[Health care in Singapore]] is mainly under the responsibility of the [[Singapore Government]]'s [[Ministry of Health (Singapore)|Ministry of Health]]. Singapore generally has an efficient and widespread system of health care. It implements a [[universal health care]] system, and co-exists with private health care system. [[Infant mortality]] rate: in 2006 the crude birth rate stood at 10.1 per 1000, and the crude death rate was also one of the lowest in the world at 4.3 per 1000. In 2006, the total fertility rate was only 1.26 children per woman, the 3rd lowest in the world and well below the 2.10 needed to replace the population. Singapore was ranked 6th in the [[World Health Organization]]'s ranking of the world's health systems in the year 2000.

[[Singapore]] has a universal health care system where government ensures affordability, largely through compulsory savings and price controls, while the private sector provides most care. Overall spending on health care amounts to only 3% of annual GDP. Of that, 66% comes from private sources.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whosis/database/core/core_select.cfm |title=World Health Organization Statistical Information System: Core Health Indicators |publisher=Who.int |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore currently has the lowest infant mortality rate in the world (equaled only by Iceland) and among the highest life expectancies from birth, according to the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/entity/whosis/whostat2007_1mortality.pdf "World Health Statistics 2007: Mortality"], based on 2005 data.&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore has "one of the most successful health care systems in the world, in terms of both efficiency in financing and the results achieved in community health outcomes," according to an analysis by global consulting firm [[Watson Wyatt Worldwide|Watson Wyatt]].&lt;ref name="Watson Wyatt Singapore"/&gt; Singapore's system uses a combination of compulsory savings from payroll deductions (funded by both employers and workers) a nationalized catastrophic health insurance plan, and government subsidies, as well as "actively regulating the supply and prices of health care services in the country" to keep costs in check; the specific features have been described as potentially a "very difficult system to replicate in many other countries." Many Singaporeans also have supplemental private health insurance (often provided by employers) for services not covered by the government's programs.&lt;ref name="Watson Wyatt Singapore"&gt;John Tucci, [http://www.watsonwyatt.com/europe/pubs/healthcare/render2.asp?ID=13850 "The Singapore health system – achieving positive health outcomes with low expenditure"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419231253/http://www.watsonwyatt.com/europe/pubs/healthcare/render2.asp?ID=13850 |date=19 April 2010 }}, Watson Wyatt Healthcare Market Review, October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore’s well-established health care system comprises a total of 13 private hospitals, 10 public (government) hospitals and several specialist clinics, each specializing in and catering to different patient needs, at varying costs.

Patients are free to choose the providers within the government or private health care delivery system and can walk in for a consultation at any private clinic or any government polyclinic. For emergency services, patients can go at any time to the 24-hour Accident &amp; Emergency Departments located in the government hospitals.

Singapore's medical facilities are among the finest in the world, with well qualified doctors and dentists, many trained overseas.

Singapore has [[medical savings account]] system known as [[Medisave]].

===Syria===
{{Main article|Health in Syria}}

The [[Baath Party]] has placed an emphasis on [[health care]], but funding levels have not been able to keep up with demand or maintain quality. Health expenditures reportedly accounted for 2.5 percent of the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 2001. Syria’s health system is relatively decentralized and focuses on offering primary health care at three levels: village, district, and provincial. According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), in 1990 Syria had 41 general [[hospital]]s (33 public, 8 private), 152 specialized hospitals (16 public, 136 private), 391 rural health centers, 151 urban health centers, 79 rural health units, and 49 specialized health centers; [[hospital bed]]s totaled 13,164 (77 percent public, 23 percent private), or 11 beds per 10,000 inhabitants. The number of state hospital beds reportedly fell between 1995 and 2001, while the population had an 18 percent increase, but the opening of new hospitals in 2002 caused the number of hospital beds to double. WHO reported that in 1989 Syria had a total of 10,114 [[physician]]s, 3,362 [[dentist]]s, and 14,816 [[nurse]]s and [[midwive]]s; in 1995 the rate of health professionals per 10,000 inhabitants was 10.9 physicians, 5.6 dentists, and 21.2 nurses and midwives. Despite overall improvements, Syria’s health system exhibits significant regional disparities in the availability of health care, especially between urban and rural areas. The number of private hospitals and doctors increased by 41 percent between 1995 and 2001 as a result of growing demand and growing wealth in a small sector of society. Almost all private health facilities are located in large urban areas such as [[Damascus]], [[Aleppo]], [[Tartus]], and [[Latakia]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Syria.pdf Syria country profile].

===Taiwan===
{{Main article|Health in Taiwan}}

The current health care system in [[Taiwan]], known as National Health Insurance (NHI), was instituted in 1995. NHI is a single-payer compulsory social insurance plan which centralizes the disbursement of health care dollars. The system promises equal access to health care for all citizens, and the population coverage had reached 99% by the end of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Fanchiang, Cecilia.[http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/Tj/ct.asp?xItem=20439&amp;CtNode=122 "New IC health insurance card expected to offer many benefits"], ''Taiwan Journal, 2 January 2004'' Accessed 28 March 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606010447/http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/Tj/ct.asp?xItem=20439&amp;CtNode=122 |date=6 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NHI is mainly financed through premiums, which are based on the payroll tax, and is supplemented with out-of-pocket payments and direct government funding. In the initial stage, fee-for-service predominated for both public and private providers. Most health providers operate in the private sector and form a competitive market on the health delivery side. However, many health care providers took advantage of the system by offering unnecessary services to a larger number of patients and then billing the government. In the face of increasing loss and the need for cost containment, NHI changed the payment system from fee-for-service to a global budget, a kind of prospective payment system, in 2002.

According to [[T.R. Reid]], Taiwan achieves "remarkable efficiency", costing ≈6 percent of GDP [[universal health care|universal coverage]]; however, this underestimates the cost as it is not fully funded and the government is forced to borrow to make up the difference. "And frankly, the solution is fairly obvious: increase the spending a little, to maybe 8 percent of GDP. Of course, if Taiwan did that, it would still be spending less than half of what America spends."&lt;ref name=trr&gt;[[T.R. Reid]] [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89651916 "Taiwan Takes Fast Track to Universal Health Care"], [[NPR]] 15 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thailand===
{{Main article|Health in Thailand}}

The majority of health care services in Thailand is delivered by the public sector, which includes 1,002 hospitals and 9,765 health stations. [[Universal health care]] is provided through three programs: the civil service welfare system for civil servants and their families, Social Security for private employees, and the Universal Coverage scheme theoretically available to all other Thai nationals. Some private hospitals are participants in these programs, though most are financed by patient self-payment and private insurance.

The [[Ministry of Public Health (Thailand)|Ministry of Public Health]] (MOPH) oversees national health policy and also operates most government health facilities. The National Health Security Office (NHSO) allocates funding through the Universal Coverage program. Other health-related government agencies include the Health System Research Institute (HSRI), Thai Health Promotion
Foundation ("ThaiHealth"), National Health Commission Office (NHCO), and the Emergency Medical Institute of Thailand (EMIT). Although there have been national policies for decentralization, there has been resistance in implementing such changes and the MOPH still directly controls most aspects of health care.

===Turkmenistan===
{{Main article|Health in Turkmenistan}}

In the post-Soviet era, reduced funding has put the health system in poor condition. In 2002 [[Turkmenistan]] had 50 hospital beds per 10,000 population, less than half the number in 1996. Overall policy has targeted specialized inpatient facilities to the detriment of basic, outpatient care. Since the late 1990s, many rural facilities have closed, making care available principally in urban areas. President [[Saparmurat Niyazov|Niyazov]]’s 2005 proposal to close all hospitals outside [[Ashgabat]] intensified this trend. [[Physicians]] are poorly trained, modern medical techniques are rarely used, and medications are in short supply. In 2004 Niyazov dismissed 15,000 medical professionals, exacerbating the shortage of personnel. In some cases, professionals have been replaced by military conscripts. Private health care is rare, as the state maintains a near monopoly. Government-paid public health care was abolished in 2004.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Turkmenistan.pdf Turkmenistan country profile].

===United Arab Emirates===
{{Main article|Health in the United Arab Emirates}}

Standards of health care are considered to be generally high in the [[United Arab Emirates]], resulting from increased government spending during strong economic years. According to the UAE government, total expenditures on health care from 1996 to 2003 were US$436 million. According to the [[World Health Organization]], in 2004 total expenditures on health care constituted 2.9 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), and the per capita expenditure for health care was US$497. Health care currently is government-paid only for UAE citizens. Effective January 2006, all residents of [[Abu Dhabi]] are covered by a new comprehensive health insurance program; costs will be shared between employers and employees. The number of [[physician|doctors]] per 100,000 (annual average, 1990–99) is 181. The UAE now has 40 public hospitals, compared with only seven in 1970. The Ministry of Health is undertaking a multimillion-dollar program to expand health facilities – hospitals, medical centers, and a trauma center – in the seven emirates. A state-of-the-art general hospital has opened in Abu Dhabi with a projected bed capacity of 143, a trauma unit, and the first home health care program in the UAE. To attract wealthy UAE nationals and expatriates who traditionally have traveled abroad for serious medical care, Dubai is developing [[Dubai Healthcare City]], a hospital free zone that will offer international-standard advanced private health care and provide an academic medical training center; completion is scheduled for 2010.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/UAE.pdf United Arab Emirates country profile].

===Uzbekistan===
{{Main article|Health in Uzbekistan}}

In the post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, the quality of [[Uzbekistan]]’s [[health care]] has declined. Between 1992 and 2003, spending on health care and the ratio of hospital beds to population both decreased by nearly 50 percent, and Russian [[emigration]] in that decade deprived the health system of many practitioners. In 2004 Uzbekistan had 53 hospital beds per 10,000 population. Basic medical supplies such as disposable [[Hypodermic needle|needles]], [[anesthetics]], and [[antibiotics]] are in very short supply. Although all citizens nominally are entitled to [[government-paid health care|free health care]], in the post-Soviet era [[bribery]] has become a common way to bypass the slow and limited service of the state system. In the early 2000s, policy has focused on improving primary health care facilities and cutting the cost of inpatient facilities. The state budget for 2006 allotted 11.1 percent to health expenditures, compared with 10.9 percent in 2005.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Uzbekistan.pdf Uzbekistan country profile].

===Vietnam===
{{Main article|Health in Vietnam}}

The overall quality of '''health in [[Vietnam]]''' is regarded as good, as reflected by 2005 estimates of [[life expectancy]] (70.61 years) and infant mortality (25.95 per 1,000 live births). However, [[malnutrition]] is still common in the provinces, and the life expectancy and [[infant mortality]] rates are stagnating. In 2001 government spending on health care corresponded to just 0.9 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). Government subsidies covered only about 20 percent of health care expenses, with the remaining 80 percent coming out of individuals’ own pockets.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Vietnam.pdf Vietnam country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (December 2005). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954 the government in the North established a public health system that reached down to the hamlet level. After reunification in 1976, this system was extended to the South. Beginning in the late 1980s, the quality of health care began to decline as a result of budgetary constraints, a shift of responsibility to the provinces, and the introduction of charges. Inadequate funding has led to delays in planned upgrades to [[water supply]] and [[sewage]] systems. As a result, almost half the population has no access to clean water, a deficiency that promotes such infectious diseases as [[malaria]], [[dengue fever]], [[typhoid]], and [[cholera]]. Inadequate funding also has contributed to a shortage of [[nurses]], [[midwives]], and hospital beds. In 2000 Vietnam had only 250,000 hospital beds, or 14.8 beds per 10,000 people, a very low ratio among Asian nations, according to the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

===Yemen===
{{Main article|Health in Yemen}}

Despite the significant progress [[Yemen]] has made to expand and improve its health care system over the past decade, the system remains severely underdeveloped. Total expenditures on health care in 2002 constituted 3.7 percent of [[gross domestic product]]. In that same year, the per capita expenditure for health care was very low, as compared with other [[Middle East]]ern countries – US$58 according to [[United Nations]] statistics and US$23 according to the [[World Health Organization]]. According to the [[World Bank]], the number of [[physician|doctors]] in Yemen rose by an average of more than 7 percent between 1995 and 2000, but as of 2004 there were still only three doctors per 10,000 persons. In 2003 Yemen had only 0.6 hospital beds available per 1,000 persons.&lt;ref name=autogenerated17&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Yemen.pdf Yemen country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (December 2006). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Health care services are particularly scarce in rural areas; only 25 percent of rural areas are covered by health services, as compared with 80 percent of urban areas. [[Emergency services]], such as [[ambulance]] service and [[blood banks]], are non-existent. Most childhood deaths are caused by illnesses for which [[vaccines]] exist or that are otherwise preventable. According to the [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS]], in 2003 an estimated 12,000 people in Yemen were living with [[human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (HIV/AIDS).&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

===Belgium===
{{main article|Healthcare in Belgium}}

As in most countries, the Belgian system divides itself into state and private, though fees are payable in both. A person must have adequate coverage through either the state or private insurance. In the state ''mutuelle/mutualiteit'' scheme a person has the ability to choose any doctor, clinic or hospital in any location without referral, according to the patient's needs in much the same way as with private insurance.

====Doctors====
General practitioners can be found in private practices or attached to clinics and hospitals. A person is free to consult or register with any of their own choosing.  Similarly with specialist consultants. Reimbursements are available for those with insurance, either private or public. If a patient is on a private scheme, or is uninsured, the fee is payable in full at the time of the appointment. The patient then brings, mails or deposits the receipt to his insurance mutuality which then immediately repays the amount.

The majority of dentists in Belgium are private, though there are those who accept part-payment on state insurance.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

As with general practitioners, patients can arrange to see a specialist of their choice at any hospital. Those going into hospital for a planned stay need to take personal care items (such as a towel, soap etc.) with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jessazh.be/patienten-bezoekers/opname/campus-salvator/gewone-opname/wat-meebrengen |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130115045216/http://www.jessazh.be/patienten-bezoekers/opname/campus-salvator/gewone-opname/wat-meebrengen |archivedate=15 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brussels]], the eleven big public hospitals are organized under the Iris association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iris-hopitaux.be/|title=Hôpitaux du réseau Iris Bruxelles|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complementary health care====
The Ministry of Health recognizes [[homeopathy]], [[acupuncture]], [[osteopathy]] and [[chiropractic]] as reimbursable alternative treatments.  Reimbursement is possible only if the practitioner is registered as a qualified doctor.

====Emergency treatment====
If a call is made to the Emergency services using the [[Emergency telephone number|old emergency number ('''100''')]] or the [[112 (emergency telephone number)|European telephone number ('''112''')]], an ambulance will transport the patient to the nearest hospital or the best centre suited according to the needs of the patient, for example, a [[Burn center|Specialist Burns Unit]].

====Pharmacies====
[[Pharmacies]] are common in Belgium and are marked with a green cross on the street. There is a rota system for pharmacists to open outside of usual hours through the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riziv.fgov.be/care/nl/infos/infobox/pharmacists/pdf/infobox_pharmacists.pdf|title= |publisher=INAMI|accessdate=30 November 2016}}{{deadlink|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Health Insurance====
Health care insurance is a part of the Belgian social security system. To enroll, a person must first join a health insurance fund ''mutuelle'' (''mutualité'') or ''ziekenfonds'' (''mutualiteit'') for which an employer's certificate is required if the employer is to contribute to the cost. If employed a person's contributions is automatically deducted from salary. The employer will also pay a contribution. Health insurance funds will reimburse medical costs. The choice of mutual insurer is up to the individual. Most of them are affiliated to a religious or political institution but there is no real difference between them because reimbursement rates are fixed by the Belgian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=nl&amp;la=N&amp;table_name=wet&amp;cn=1994071438|title=LOI|publisher=WET|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insurance funds do not always cover the full costs of treatment and typical reimbursement is between half to three-quarters of a typical doctors or specialists visit. A deciding factor here depends on one's job. From people who are unemployed or disabled, receiving other benefits or business-owners receive somewhat less.  There is also a ''"yearly maximum bill"'' meaning that someone who has paid a certain amount to their doctor/hospital within the year does not have to make any further payment. From this point, any extra is returned from the patient's insurance. In general, the poor, even without reaching the necessary sum, do not pay anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.socialsecurity.be/CMS/nl/citizen/displayThema/health/SANTH_4/SANTH_4_3.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610230110/https://www.socialsecurity.be/CMS/nl/citizen/displayThema/health/SANTH_4/SANTH_4_3.xml |archivedate=10 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bulgaria===
{{Main article|Health in Bulgaria}}

[[Bulgaria]] began overall reform of its antiquated health system, inherited from the [[communist]] era, only in 1999. In the 1990s, private medical practices expanded somewhat, but most Bulgarians relied on communist-era public [[clinic]]s while paying high prices for special care. During that period, national health indicators generally worsened as economic crises substantially decreased health funding. The subsequent health reform program has introduced mandatory employee health insurance through the [[National Health Insurance Fund]] (NHIF), which since 2000 has paid a gradually increasing portion of primary health care costs. Employees and employers pay an increasing, mandatory percentage of [[Salary|salaries]], with the goal of gradually reducing state support of health care. Private health insurance plays only a supplementary role. The system also has been decentralized by making municipalities responsible for their own health care facilities, and by 2005 most primary care came from private [[physician]]s. Pharmaceutical distribution also was decentralized.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Bulgaria.pdf Bulgaria country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (October 2006). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, the hospital system was reduced substantially to limit reliance on hospitals for routine care. Anticipated membership in the [[European Union]] (2007) was a major motivation for this trend. Between 2002 and 2003, the number of hospital beds was reduced by 56 percent to 24,300. However, the pace of reduction slowed in the early 2000s; in 2004 some 258 hospitals were in operation, compared with the estimated optimal number of 140. Between 2002 and 2004, health care expenditures in the national budget increased from 3.8 percent to 4.3 percent, with the NHIF accounting for more than 60 percent of annual expenditures.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

In the 1990s, the quality of medical research and training decreased seriously because of low funding. In the early 2000s, the emphasis of medical and [[paramedic]]al training, which was conducted in five medical schools, was preparation of primary-care personnel to overcome shortages resulting from the communist system’s long-term emphasis on training specialists. Experts considered that Bulgaria had an adequate supply of [[physician|doctors]] but a shortage of other medical personnel. In 2000 Bulgaria had 3.4 doctors, 3.9 nurses, and 0.5 midwives per 1,000 population.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

===Denmark===
{{Main article|Health care in Denmark}}

Denmark's health care system has retained the same basic structure since the early 1970s. The administration of hospitals and personnel is dealt with by the Ministry of the Interior, while primary care facilities, health insurance, and community care are the responsibility of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Anyone can go to a physician for no fee and the public health system entitles each Dane to his/her own doctor. Expert medical/surgical aid is available, with a qualified nursing staff. Costs are borne by public authorities, but high taxes contribute to these costs. As of 1999, there were an estimated 3.4 physicians and 4.5 hospital beds per 1,000 people. The number of hospital beds, like that in other EU countries, has undergone a major decline since 1980, from around 40,000 to about 23,000 in 1998/99. Deinstitutionalization of psychiatric patients has contributed significantly to this trend. The ratio of doctors to population, by contrast, has increased during this period.

The total fertility rate in 2000 was 1.7, while the maternal mortality rate was 10 per 100,000 live births as of 1998. Studies show that between 1980 and 1993, 63% of married women (ages 15 to 49) used contraception. As of 2002 cardiovascular diseases and cancer were the leading causes of death. Denmark's cancer rates were the highest in the European Union. In 1999, there were only 12 reported cases of tuberculosis per 100,000 people. As of 1999, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS was estimated at 4,300 and deaths from AIDS that year were estimated at less than 100. HIV prevalence was 0.17 per 100 adults.

Danish citizens may choose between two systems of primary health care: medical care paid for by the government provided by a doctor whom the individual chooses for a year and by those specialists to whom the doctor refers the patient; or complete freedom of choice of any physician or specialist at any time, with state reimbursement of about two-thirds of the cost for medical bills paid directly by the patient. Most Danes opt for the former. All patients receive subsidies on pharmaceuticals and vital drugs; everyone must pay a share of dental bills. As of 1999, total health care expenditure was estimated at 8.4% of GDP.

Responsibility for the public hospital service rests with county authorities. Counties form public hospital regions, each of which is allotted one or two larger hospitals with specialists and two to four smaller hospitals where medical treatment is practically totally paid for by the government. State-appointed medical health officers, responsible to the National Board of Health, are employed to advise local governments on health matters. Public health authorities have waged large-scale campaigns against tuberculosis, venereal diseases, diphtheria, and poliomyelitis. The government-paid guidance and assistance given to mothers of newborn children by public health nurses have resulted in a low infant mortality rate of 4 per 1,000 live births (2000). Medical treatment is government-paid up to school age, when government-paid school medical inspections begin. As of 1999, children up to one year of age were vaccinated against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (99%) and measles (92%). In 2000, life expectancy at birth was 76 years for males and females. The overall death rate was 11 per 1,000 people in 1999.

===Estonia===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Estonia}}

Healthcare in Estonia is supervised by the [[Estonian Ministry of Social Affairs|Ministry of Social Affairs]] and funded by general taxation through the National Health Service.

===Finland===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Finland}}

In [[Finland]], public medical services at clinics and hospitals are run by the municipalities (local government) and are funded 78% by [[taxation]], 20% by patients through access charges, and by others 2%. Patient access charges are subject to annual caps. For example, GP visits are (€11 per visit with annual €33 cap), hospital outpatient treatment (€22 per visit), a hospital stay, including food, medical care and medicines (€26 per 24 hours, or €12 if in a psychiatric hospital). After a patient has spent €590 per year on public medical services, all treatment and medications thereafter are paid for by the government. Taxation funding is partly local and partly nationally based. Patients can claim re-imbursement of part of their prescription costs from [[KELA (Finnish Social Insurance)|KELA]]. Finland also has a much smaller private medical sector which accounts for about 14 percent of total health care spending. Only 8% of doctors choose to work in private practice, and some of these also choose to do some work in the public sector. Private sector patients can claim a contribution from KELA towards their private medical costs (including [[dentistry]]) if they choose to be treated in the more expensive private sector, or they can join private insurance funds. However, private sector health care is mainly in the primary care sector. There are virtually no private hospitals, the main hospitals being either municipally owned (funded from local taxes) or run by the teaching universities (funded jointly by the municipalities and the national government). In 2005, Finland spent 7.5% of GDP on health care, or US$2,824 per capita. Of that, approximately 78% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

===France===
{{Main article|Health care in France}}

In its [[World Health Organization ranking of health systems|2000 assessment of world health systems]], the [[World Health Organization]] found that France provided the "best overall health care" in the world.&lt;ref name="WHO2000"/&gt; In 2005, France spent 11.2% of GDP on health care, or US$3,926 per capita. Of that, approximately 80% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

In [[France]], most doctors remain in private practice; there are both [[Private sector|private]] and [[public hospital|public]] [[hospital]]s. Social Security consists of several public organizations, distinct from the state government, with separate budgets that refunds patients for care in both private and public facilities. It generally refunds patients 70% of most health care costs, and 100% in case of costly or long-term ailments. Supplemental coverage may be bought from private insurers, most of them [[nonprofit]], [[mutual insurer]]s, to the point that the word "{{ill|mutuelle|fr|Mutuelle de santé en France|vertical-align=sup}}" (mutual) has come to be a synonym of supplemental private insurer in common language.

Until recently, social security coverage was restricted to those who contributed to social security (generally, workers, unemployed or retirees), excluding some few poor segments of the population; the government of [[Lionel Jospin]] put into place the "universal health coverage" allowing the entire French population to benefit from Health care. In some systems, patients can also take private health insurance but choose to receive care at public hospitals, if allowed by the private [[insurer]]. For serious illness, regardless of the insurance regime, the national health system will assume the cost of long-term remedial treatment.

===Germany===
{{Main article|Health in Germany}}
[[File:UniKlinik (Freiburg) 4.jpg|thumb|The [[University Medical Center Freiburg]] in [[Germany]]]]

[[Germany]] has a universal multi-payer system with two main types of health insurance: "Law-enforced health insurance" (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung) known as sickness funds "Krankenkasse" and "Privat" (Private Krankenversicherung)
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm |title=The Case for Universal Health Care in the United States |publisher=Cthealth.server101.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.willamette.edu/centers/publicpolicy/projects/oregonsfuture/PDFvol5no2/countries_healthcare.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221134435/http://www.willamette.edu/centers/publicpolicy/projects/oregonsfuture/PDFvol5no2/countries_healthcare.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory insurance applies to those below a set income level and is provided through private non-profit "sickness funds" at similar rates for all members, and is paid for with joint employer-employee contributions. Provider compensation rates are negotiated in complex [[corporatism|corporatist]] social bargaining among specified autonomously organized interest groups (e.g. physicians' associations) at the level of [[States of Germany|federal states]] (Länder).  The sickness funds are mandated to provide a wide range of coverage and cannot refuse membership or otherwise discriminate on an actuarial basis. Small numbers of persons are covered by tax-funded government employee insurance or social welfare insurance. Persons with incomes above the prescribed compulsory insurance level may decide to remain in the sickness fund system, which a majority do, or opt out &amp; take private insurance.  Private supplementary insurance to the sickness funds of various sorts is available.

In 2005, Germany spent 10.7% of GDP on health care, or US$3,628 per capita. Of that, approximately 77% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

===Greece===
{{Main article|Health care in Greece}}

The [[Health care in Greece|Greek healthcare system]] is [[universal healthcare|universal]] and is ranked as one of the best in the world. In a 2000 [[World Health Organization]] report it was ranked 14th in the overall assessment and 11th at quality of service, surpassing countries such as the [[United Kingdom]] (18th) and [[Germany]] (25th).&lt;ref name="WHO report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf |title=Health Systems: Improving Performance |work=The World Health Report 2000 |publisher=www.who.int |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 there were 131 hospitals with 35,000 beds in the country, but on 1 July 2011 the [[Ministry for Health and Social Solidarity (Greece)|Ministry for Health and Social Solidarity]] announced its proposal to shorten the number to 83 hospitals with 33,000 beds.&lt;ref name="Health Reform"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tovima.gr/files/1/2011/07/%CE%A0%CF%81%CF%8C%CF%84%CE%B1%CF%83%CE%B7%20%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%AC%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%BE%CE%B7%CF%82.pdf |script-title=el:ΠΡΟΤΑΣΗ ΛΕΙΤΟΥΡΓΙΚΩΝ ΑΝΑΔΙΑΤΑΞΕΩΝ ΜΟΝΑΔΩΝ ΥΓΕΙΑΣ ΕΣΥ |language=Greek |date=1 July 2011 |publisher=www.tovima.gr |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greece's healthcare expenditures as a percentage of [[GDP]] were 9.6% in 2007 according to a 2011 [[OECD]] report, just above the OECD average of 9.5%.&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/45/54/38979850.pdf |title=OECD Health Data 2011: How Does Greece Compare |publisher=www.oecd.org |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has the largest number of doctors-to-population ratio of any OECD country.&lt;ref name="OECD" /&gt;

===Iceland===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Iceland}}

Healthcare in [[Iceland]] is universal. The healthcare system is largely paid for by taxes (85%) and to some extent by service fees (15%) and is administrated by the Ministry of Welfare. A considerable portion of government spending is assigned to healthcare. There is almost no private health insurance in Iceland and no private hospitals.

===Ireland===
{{Main article|Healthcare in the Republic of Ireland}}

All persons resident in the [[Republic of Ireland]] are entitled to health care through the public health care system, which is managed by the [[Health Service Executive]] and funded by general taxation. A person may be required to pay a subsidised fee for certain health care received; this depends on income, age, illness or disability. All maternity services are however paid for by the government, as well as health care of infants under 6 months of age. Emergency care is provided at a cost of €120 for a visit to a hospital Emergency Department.

===Italy===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Italy}}

According to [[World Health Organization ranking of health systems|WHO in 2000]], Italy had the world's "second overall best" healthcare system in the world, coming after [[France]], and surpassing [[Spain]], [[Oman]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whr/2000/media_centre/press_release/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; World Health Organization Assesses the World's Health Systems |publisher=Who.int |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 [[Italy]] adopted a tax-funded [[universal health care]] system called "National Health Service" (in [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''[[Servizio Sanitario Nazionale]]''), which was closely modeled on the British system. The SSN covers general practice (distinct between adult and pediatric practice), outpatient and inpatient treatments, and the cost of most (but not all) drugs and sanitary ware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jose Marc Castro |url=http://www.expatforum.com/articles/health/health-care-in-italy.html |title=Health Care in Italy |publisher=Expatforum.com |date=8 August 2009 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The government sets LEA (fundamental levels of care, ''Livelli essenziali di assistenza'' in Italian) which cover all necessary treatments, which the state must guarantee to all, paid for by the government, or for a "ticket", a share of the costs (but various categories are exempted).&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.ministerosalute.it/programmazione/lea/lea.jsp LEA]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118215835/http://www.ministerosalute.it/programmazione/lea/lea.jsp |date=18 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The public system has also the duty of prevention at place of work and in the general environment.
A private sector also exists, with a minority role in medicine but a principal role in [[dental health]], as most people prefer private dental services.

In Italy the public system has the unique feature of paying general practitioners a fee [[per capita]] per year, a salary system, that does not reward repeat visits, testing, and referrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ess-europe.de/en/italy.htm |title=Health Service/Insurance Industry in Italy |publisher=Ess-europe.de |date=30 November 1998 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720065219/http://www.ess-europe.de/en/italy.htm |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
While there is a paucity of nurses, Italy has one of the highest doctor per capita ratios at 3.9 [[Physician|doctors]] per 1,000 patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/53/12/38976551.pdf |title=Practising physicians per 1000 population, OECD countries, 2005 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2005, Italy spent 8.9% of GDP on health care, or US$2,714 per capita. Of that, approximately 76% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

===Netherlands===
{{Main article|Health in the Netherlands}}

[[Health care in the Netherlands]], has since January 2006 been provided by a system of compulsory insurance backed by a [[risk equalization]] program so that the insured are not penalized for their age or health status. This is meant to encourage competition between health care providers and insurers. Children under 18 are insured by the government, and special assistance is available to those with limited incomes. In 2005, the Netherlands spent 9.2% of GDP on health care, or US$3,560 per capita. Of that, approximately 65% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

===Norway===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Norway}}

Norway has a government run and government financed universal health care system, covering
physical and mental health for all and dental health for children under the age of 16. Hospitals are paid by the state and doctor visit fees are capped at a fairly low rate. Short-term prescriptions for medication are market price, but long-term prescriptions, defined as more than three months a year, are eligible for a large discount. In addition, a yearly cap applies for people with high medical expenses.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Some health care is private.  For example, most adults use private dental care, whereas the public system only treats people, for a normal fee, when they have free capacity. Health-related plastic surgery (like burn damage) is covered by the public system, while cosmetic surgery in general is private. There are a number of private psychologists, there are also some private general practice doctors and specialists.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Public health care is financed by a special-purpose income tax on the order of 8-11%, loosely translated as "public benefits fee" (Norwegian: "trygdeavgift og Folketrygden"). This can be considered a mandatory public insurance, covering not only health care but also loss of income during sick leave, public pension, unemployment benefits, benefits for single parents and a few others. The system is supposed to be self-financing from the taxes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Norwegian citizens living in Norway are automatically covered, even if they never had taxable income. Norwegian citizens living and working abroad (taxable elsewhere and therefore not paying the "public benefits fee" to Norway) are covered for up to one year after they move abroad, and must pay an estimated market cost for public health care services. Non-citizens such as foreign visitors are covered in full.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

According to WHO, total health care expenditure in 2005 was 9% of GDP and paid 84% by government, 15% by private out-of-pocket and ≈1% by other private sources.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS"/&gt;

In [[Poland]], healthcare is delivered through a publicly funded healthcare system, which is free for all citizens, and this is enshrined in Article 68 of the [[Constitution of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polish Constitution|url=http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/polski/kon1.htm|publisher=Polish Parliament|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poland's expenditure on healthcare was 6.7% of GDP in 2012 or $900 per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.country.country-POL|title=  Poland – statistics summary (2002–present)|publisher=GHO – by country|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public spending rate for Poland in 2012 was 72% – in-line with the OECD average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/economics/oecd-economic-surveys-poland-2012/improving-the-health-care-system_eco_surveys-pol-2012-4-en#page1|title=Improving the health-care system  |publisher=OECD READ edition|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of private medical complexes also complement public healthcare institutions nationwide.

===Romania===
{{Main article|Health in Romania}}

Health care public system has been improved but it is still poor by European standards, and access is limited in rural areas. In 2007 health expenditures were equal to 3.9 percent of gross domestic product. In 2007 there were 2.2 physicians and 6.4 hospital beds per 1,000 people. The system is funded by the National Health Care Insurance Fund, to which employers and employees make mandatory contributions. Private health care system has developed slowly but now consists of 22 private hospitals and more than 240 clinics.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Romania.pdf Romania country profile].

===Sweden===
{{Main article|Health in Sweden}}
[[File:Karolinska.sthlm.2006.jpg|thumb|Karolinska university hospital in Stockholm (2006)]]

The [[Sweden|Swedish]] public health system is funded through taxes levied by the [[County Councils of Sweden|county councils]], but partly run by private companies. There is a fixed charge of SEK 150 (US$21) for each visit to a doctor or a hospital but some may vary depending on the business itself and cause of admission &amp; desired service whereas prices can vary up to SEK 350 (US$52). Healthcare services that are accepted by the Swedish Board of Health (hälsovårdsnämnden) have "safe net" limits for visitors placed upon them to a maximum SEK 800 (US$111) per year along with prescription medicine from those clinics are also limited to 1,800 SEK (US$249) per year. Government-paid dental care for children under 21 years old is included in the system, and dental care for grown-ups is to a small extent subsidised by it.
Sweden also has a smaller private health care sector, mainly in larger cities or as centers for preventive health care financed by employers.

===Switzerland===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Switzerland}}
[[File:Spaceship-style Hospital in Zurich.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A private hospital in [[Zurich, Switzerland]].]]

In [[Switzerland]], compulsory [[health insurance]] covers the costs of medical treatment and hospitalization of the insured. The Swiss healthcare system is a combination of public, subsidized private and totally private healthcare providers, where the insured person has full freedom of choice among the providers in his region.  Insurance companies independently set their price points for different age groups, but are forbidden from setting prices based on health risk. In 2000, Switzerland topped all European countries’ health care expenditure when calculated as per capita expenditure in US dollar purchasing parity terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/e68670.pdf |title=Front |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss health care system was the last for-profit system in Europe.  In the 1990s, after the private carriers began to deny coverage for pre-existing conditions – and when the uninsured population of Switzerland reached 5% – the Swiss held a referendum (1995) and adopted their present system.

'''Health care in [[Turkey]]''' used to be dominated by a centralized state system run by the Ministry of Health. In 2003 the government introduced a sweeping health reform program aimed at increasing the ratio of private to state health provision and making health care available to a larger share of the population. Information from the [[Turkish Statistical Institute]] states that 76.3 billions of [[Turkish Lira]]s are being spent in healthcare, with 79.6% of funding coming from the [[Sosyal Güvenlik Kurumu]] and most of the remainder (15.4%) coming from out-of-pocket payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ekonomi/24892271.asp|title=Sağlığa 76,3 milyar lira harcandı|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 27.954 medical institutions, one doctor for 587 people and 2.54 beds for 1000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuik.gov.tr/UstMenu.do?metod=temelist|title=..::Türkiye İstatistik Kurumu Web sayfalarına Hoş Geldiniz::..|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|Health care in the United Kingdom}}

The four [[countries of the United Kingdom]] have separate but co-operating public health care systems that were created in 1948: in [[England]] the public health system is known as the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]], in [[Scotland]] it is known as [[NHS Scotland]], in [[Wales]] as [[NHS Wales|NHS Wales (GIG Cymru)]], and in [[Northern Ireland]] it is called [[Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland]]. All four provide state-paid healthcare to all UK residents, paid for from general taxation. Though the public systems dominate, private health care and a wide variety of alternative and complementary treatments are available for those who have private health insurance or are willing to pay directly themselves.

One difference between the four public health care systems is the patient cost for prescriptions. Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland have recently abolished, or are in the process of abolishing, all prescription charges, while England (with the exception of [[birth control pills]], which are paid for by the state) continues to charge patients who are between 18 and 60 years old a fixed prescription fee of £8.40 per item, unless they are exempt because of certain medical conditions (including cancer) or are on low income. Since health care delivery is a [[devolution|devolved matter]], considerable differences are developing between the systems in each of the countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7149423.stm NHS now four different systems], [[BBC]], 2 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==

===Canada===
{{Main article|Health care in Canada}}

[[Canada]] has a federally sponsored, publicly funded [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]] system. Most services are provided by the public sector, and the remainder are provided by the private sector.

;Political responsibility
The Medicare system spans the federal and provincial governments and funding flows from the federal governments to the provinces to administer. The country's prime minister and most provincial premiers say they are committed to the [[Social Union Framework Agreement]] that promotes "comprehensiveness, universality, portability, public administration and accessibility" in health care.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Canada, Social Union, News Release, "[http://socialunion.gc.ca/news/020499_e.html A Framework to Improve the Social Union for Canadians: An Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Governments of the Provinces and Territories, February 4, 1999]."&lt;/ref&gt; Retrieved 20 December 2006.

;GDP
In 2005, Canada spent 9.8% of GDP on health care, or US$3,463 per capita.  Of that, approximately 70% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

;Services and costs
Canada's system is a [[single payer system]], where basic services are provided by private doctors. Hospitals provide additional services as well as community health clinics, and private clinics. Costs are paid for by the government for many services, but other services can be covered by private health plans that many employers offer as benefits. Some provinces still charge premiums to individuals and families. As well, some hospitals charge minimal user fees for [[emergency department]] visits.

;Private sector involvement
Other areas of health care, such as [[dentistry]] and [[optometry]], are wholly private, although in some provinces, emergency visits to optometrists are partly covered by medicare. Some provinces also allow private services which replicate those that are publicly offered, such as diagnostic services such as ultrasounds, x-Rays, and MRI. 
As well, many private companies acting as benefits or medical insurance providers have flourished.

;Doctor billings
Billing by doctors is complex and varies from province to province. In 1984, the [[Canada Health Act]] was passed, which prohibited extra billing by doctors on patients while at the same time billing the public insurance system. Each province may opt out, though none currently choose to. Most family doctors receive a fee per visit. These rates are negotiated between the provincial governments and the province's medical associations, usually on an annual basis.  A physician cannot charge a fee for a service that is higher than the negotiated rate – even to patients who are not covered by the publicly funded system – unless he or she opts out of billing the publicly funded system altogether.

;Pharmaceuticals
Pharmaceutical costs are set at a global median by government price controls.

;Improvement of the Canadian healthcare system
In May 2011, the Health Council released a report entitled: "Progress Report 2011: Health Care Renewal in Canada", which provides a pan-Canadian look at five key commitments of the 2003 First Ministers' Accord on Health Care Renewal&lt;ref name=2003accord&gt;{{cite web|title=2003 First Ministers Accord on Health Care Renewal|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/fptcollab/2003accord/index-eng.php|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=5 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806071254/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/fptcollab/2003accord/index-eng.php|archivedate=6 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2004 10-Year Plan to Strengthen Health Care.&lt;ref name=10yrplan&gt;{{cite web|title=A 10-year plan to strengthen health care|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/fptcollab/2004-fmm-rpm/index-eng.php|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=5 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819164453/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/fptcollab/2004-fmm-rpm/index-eng.php|archivedate=19 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report highlights the progress being achieved to date on wait times, pharmaceuticals management, electronic health records, teletriage, and health innovation.

===Costa Rica===
{{Main article|Health care in Costa Rica}}

[[Costa Rica]] provides universal health care to its citizens and permanent residents.

===Cuba===
{{Main article|Health care in Cuba}}

Health care in [[Cuba]] consists of a government-coordinated system that guarantees universal coverage and consumes a lower proportion of the nation's GDP (7.3%) than some highly privatised systems (e.g. USA: 16%) (OECD 2008). The system does charge fees in treating elective treatment for patients from abroad, but tourists who fall ill are treated free in Cuban hospitals. Cuba attracts patients mostly from [[Latin America]] and [[Europe]] by offering care of comparable quality to a developed nation but at much lower prices. Cuba's own health indicators are the best in Latin America and surpass those of the US in some respects (infant mortality rates, underweight babies, HIV infection, immunisation rates, doctor per population rates). (UNDP 2006: Tables 6,7,9,10) In 2005, Cuba spent 7.6% of GDP on health care, or US$310 per capita. Of that, approximately 91% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

=== El Salvador ===
Healthcare in El Salvador is free at the point of delivery. The public health system, which is regulated by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, has 30 public hospitals in the country plus various primary care facilities and 27 basic health care systems. According to the law of El Salvador, all individuals are given basic health services in public health institutions.

'''Health care in Mexico''' is provided via [[public]] institutions or private entities.  Health care delivered through private health care organizations operates entirely on the [[free-market]] system (e.g. it is available to those who can afford it). Public health care delivery, on the other hand, is accomplished via an elaborate provisioning and delivery system put in place by the Mexican Federal Government and the [[Mexican Social Security Institute]] (IMSS).

Advances in medicine and increasing health knowledge have increased the life expectancy in [[Mexico]] by an average of 25 years in the last years of the 20th century. Of the 6.6% [[GDP]] of government revenue spent on health, this provides only health insurance to 40% of the population who are privately employed. The health care system has three components: the social security institute, governmental services for the un-insured (Seguro Popular), and the private sector that is financed almost completely from out of pocket money. The [[Mexican Social Security Institute|IMSS]], the largest social institution in Latin America, is the governmental institution responsible of executing the Federal Government's health policy. The number of public hospitals in Mexico has increased 41% in ten years from 1985 to 1995.

According to the site www.internationalliving.com, health care in Mexico is described as very good to excellent while being highly affordable, with every medium to large city in Mexico having at least one first-rate hospital.  In fact, some California insurers sell [[health insurance]] policies that require members to go to Mexico for health care where costs are 40% lower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guaranteedhealthcare.org/files/facts_healthcare_calif.pdf Insurers require insured to go to Mexico] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103164431/http://guaranteedhealthcare.org/files/facts_healthcare_calif.pdf# |date=3 January 2012 }} Retrieved 10 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of Mexico's top-rate hospitals are internationally accredited.&lt;ref&gt;

===Trinidad and Tobago===
{{Main article|Health care in Trinidad and Tobago}}

[[Trinidad and Tobago]] operates under a two-tier health care system. That is, there is the existence of both private health care facilities and public health care facilities.
The Ministry of Health is responsible for leading the health sector. The service provision aspect of public health care has been devolved to newly created entities, the Regional Health Authorities (RHAs). The Ministry of Health is shifting its focus to concentrate on policy development, planning, monitoring and evaluation, regulation, financing and research. Citizens can access government-paid health care at public health care facilities where health insurance is not required. The health care system in the country is universal as almost all citizens utilise the services provided. Some, though, opt for private health care facilities for their ailments.

Recently, the government of Trinidad and Tobago has launched CDAP (Chronic Disease Assistance Programme). The Chronic Disease Assistance Programme provides citizens with government-paid prescription drugs and other pharmaceutical items to combat several health conditions.

[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The United States currently operates under a [[mixed market]] health care system.  Government sources (federal, state, and local) account for 45% of U.S. health care expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;CMS Annual Statistics, [http://www.cms.hhs.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/proj2008.pdf United States Department of Health and Human Services] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205102333/http://www.cms.hhs.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/proj2008.pdf |date=5 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Private sources account for the remainder of costs, with 38% of people receiving health coverage through their employers and 17% arising from other private payment such as private insurance and out-of-pocket co-pays. [[Health care reform in the United States]] usually focuses around three suggested systems, with proposals currently underway to integrate these systems in various ways to provide a number of health care options. First is [[Single-payer health care|single-payer]], a term meant to describe a single agency managing a single system, as found in most modernized countries as well as some states and municipalities within the United States. Second are employer or individual insurance mandates. Finally, there is consumer-driven health, in which systems, consumers, and patients have more control of how they access care. Over the past thirty years, most of the nation's health care has moved from the second model operating with not-for-profit institutions to the third model operating with for-profit institutions.

In the US, the social and political issues surrounding access to health care have led to vigorous public debate and the almost colloquial use of terms such as health care (medical management of illness), [[health insurance]] (reimbursement of health care costs), and [[public health]] (the collective state and range of health in a population).  In the US, 12% to 16% of the citizens do not have health insurance.  State boards and the Department of Health regulate inpatient care to reduce the national health care deficit. To tackle the problems of the perpetually increasing number of uninsured, and costs associated with the US health care system, President [[Barack Obama]] says he favors the creation of a universal health care system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obama.senate.gov/speech/070125-the_time_has_co/|title=The Time Has Come for Universal Health Care |publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226054555/http://obama.senate.gov/speech/070125-the_time_has_co/|archivedate=26 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this view is not shared across the country (see, for example, quotes from ''[[New York Times]]'' opinion columnist [[Paul Krugman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/04/opinion/04krugman.html|title=Clinton, Obama, Insurance|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=4 February 2008 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Factcheck.org]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jess Henig |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/141829 |title=Obama's Inflated Health Savings |publisher=Newsweek.com |date=15 June 2008 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

A few states have taken serious steps toward universal health care coverage, most notably [[Minnesota]], [[Massachusetts]] and [[Connecticut]], with recent examples being the [[Massachusetts 2006 Health Reform Statute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usliberals.about.com/od/healthcare/i/MassHealthIns.htm |title=About.com's Pros &amp; Cons of Massachusetts' Mandatory Health Insurance Program |publisher=Usliberals.about.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Connecticut's [[SustiNet]] plan to provide quality, affordable health care to state residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/states/ct/advocacy/articles/in_historic_vote_legislature_overrides_sustinet_veto.html |accessdate=21 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017010420/http://www.aarp.org/states/ct/advocacy/articles/in_historic_vote_legislature_overrides_sustinet_veto.html |archivedate=17 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The state of Oregon and the city of San Francisco are both examples of governments that adopted universal healthcare systems for strictly fiscal reasons.

The United States is alone among developed nations in not having a [[universal health care]] system; the 2010 [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] provides a nationwide [[health insurance exchange]] that came to fruition in 2014, but this is not universal in the way similar countries mean it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm The Case For Single Payer, Universal Health Care For The United States].&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare in the U.S. does, however, have significant publicly funded components. [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] covers the elderly and disabled with a historical work record, [[Medicaid]] is available for some, but not all of the poor,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidGenInfo/ Overview – What is Not Covered], U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] covers children of low-income families. The [[Veterans Health Administration]] directly provides health care to U.S. military veterans through a nationwide network of government hospitals; while active duty service members, retired service members and their dependents are eligible for benefits through [[TRICARE]]. Together, these tax-financed programs cover 27.8% of the population&lt;ref name="Census 2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/p60-235.pdf233.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004234451/http://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/p60-235.pdf233.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-10-04 | title=Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States:2007 |accessdate=2008-08-26 | format=PDF |work=U.S. Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; and make the government the largest health insurer in the nation. The U.S. also spends 17.9% GDP per year on healthcare, more than double the nearest developed nations expenditure.

===Australia===
{{Main article|Health care in Australia}}

In [[Australia]] the current system, known as [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]], was instituted in 1984. It coexists with a private health system. All legal permanent residents are entitled to government-paid public hospital care. Treatment by private doctors is also paid by the government when the doctor direct bills the Health Department (Bulk Billing). Medicare is funded partly by a 1.5% income tax levy (with exceptions for low-income earners), but mostly out of general revenue. An additional levy of 1% is imposed on high-income earners without private health insurance. There is a means tested 30% subsidy on private health insurance. As well as Medicare, there is a separate [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] under which listing and a government subsidy is dependent on expert evaluation of the comparative cost-effectiveness of new pharmaceuticals. In 2005, Australia spent 8.8% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] on health care, or US$3,181 per capita.  Of that, approximately 67% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/whosis/data/Search.jsp |title=WHO Statistical Information System |accessdate=2008-09-23 |publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
{{Main article|Health care in New Zealand}}

In [[New Zealand]] hospitals are public and treat citizens or permanent residents, with the fees paid by the government, and are managed by [[District Health Boards (New Zealand)|District Health Boards]]. Under the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] coalition governments (1999–2008), there were plans to make [[primary health care]] available with charges paid for by the government. At present government subsidies exist in health care. The cost of visiting a GP ranges from government-paid to $45.00 for children and from government-paid to $75.00 for adults under the current subsidies. This system is funded by taxes. The New Zealand government agency [[Pharmaceutical Management Agency|Pharmac]] subsidizes certain pharmaceuticals depending upon their category. Co-payments exist, however these are lower if the user has a ''Community Services Card'' or ''High User Health Card''. In 2005, New Zealand spent 8.9% of GDP on health care, or US$2,403 per capita. Of that, approximately 77% was government expenditure.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;

===Argentina===
{{Main article|Health in Argentina}}

[[Argentina]]’s health care system is composed of three sectors: the [[public sector]], financed through [[tax]]es; the [[private sector]], financed through voluntary [[health insurance|insurance schemes]]; and the [[social security]] sector, financed through obligatory insurance schemes.  The Ministry of Health and Social Action (MSAS), oversees all three subsectors of the health care system and is responsible for setting of regulation, evaluation and collecting statistics.

Argentina has three sectors. The public sector is funded and managed by Obras Sociales, umbrella organizations for Argentine worker's unions.  There are over 300 Obras Sociales in Argentina, each chapter being organized according to the occupation of the beneficiary. These organizations vary greatly in quality and effectiveness. The top 30 chapters hold 73% of the beneficiaries and 75% of resources for all Obras Sociales schemes and the monthly average a beneficiary receives varies from $5–80 per month.&lt;ref name="idrc"&gt;IDRC ''Reshaping Health Care in Latin America''http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-35159-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609013649/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-35159-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html# |date=9 June 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  MSAS has established a Solidarity Redistribution Fund (FSR) to try to address these beneficiary inequities.  Only workers employed in the formal sector are covered under Obras Sociales insurance schemes and after [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)|Argentina’s economic crisis of 2001]], the number of those covered under these schemes fell slightly (as unemployment increased and employment in the [[informal sector]] rose).  In 1999, there were 8.9 million beneficiaries covered by Obras Sociales.&lt;ref name="Barrientos"&gt;Armando Barrientos "Reforming Health Insurance in Argentina and Chile" ''Health Policy and Planning'' 15(4): 420&lt;/ref&gt; The private health care sector in Argentina is characterized by great heterogeneity and is made up of a great number of fragmented facilities and small networks; it consists of over 200 organizations and covers approximately 2 million Argentines.&lt;ref name="idrc"/&gt; 

Private insurance often overlaps with other forms of health care coverage, thus it is difficult to estimate the degree to which beneficiaries are dependent on the public and private sectors.  According to a 2000 report by the IRBC, foreign [[Competition (economics)|competition]] has increased in Argentina’s private sector, with [[Switzerland|Swiss]], American and other [[Latin America]]n [[health care provider]]s entering the [[Market (economics)|market]] in recent years.  This has been accompanied by little formal regulation.&lt;ref name="idrc"/&gt; The public system serves those not covered by Obras Sociales or private insurance schemes. It also provides [[emergency department|emergency services]].  According to above-mentioned IRBC report, Argentina’s public system exhibits serious structural deterioration and managerial inefficiency; a high degree of administrative centralization at the [[Provinces of Argentina|provincial level]]; rigidity in its staffing structure and labour relationships; no adequate system of incentives; inadequate information systems on which to base decision-making and control; serious deficits in facilities and equipment maintenance; and a system of management ill-suited to its size. The public system is highly decentralized to the provincial level; often [[primary care]] is even under the purview of local townships.  Since 2001, the number of Argentines relying on public services has seen an increase.  According to 2000 figures, 37.4% of Argentines had no health insurance, 48.8 were covered under Obras Sociales, 8.6% had private insurance, and 3.8% were covered by both Obras Sociales and private insurance schemes.&lt;ref name="Barrientos"/&gt;

===Brazil===
{{Main article|Health in Brazil}}

The Brazilian health system is composed of a large, public, government managed system, the SUS ([[Sistema Único de Saúde]]), which serves the majority of the population completely free of charge or any form of fee, and a private sector, managed by health insurance funds and private entrepreneurs.

The public health system, SUS, was established in 1988 by the Brazilian Constitution, and sits on 3 basic principles of universality, comprehensiveness and equity. Universality states that all citizens must have access to health care services, without any form of discrimination, regarding skin color, income, social status, gender or any other variable. There is no form of charging or payment in any public hospitals or clinics, either for Brazilian nationals or foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/brazil/healthcare/health-system|title=Healthcare System in Brazil|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government standards state that citizen's health is the result of multiple variables, including employment, income, access to land, sanitation services, access and quality of health services, education, psychic, social and family conditions, and are entitled to full and complete health care, comprising prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. Equity states that health policies should be oriented towards the reduction of inequalities between population groups and individuals, being the most needed the ones for whom policies should be first directed.

SUS also has guidelines for its implementation, the most peculiar being popular participation, which defines that all policies are to be planned and supervised directly by the population, through local, city, state and national health councils and conferences.

The level of public spending is particularly high in relation to GDP for a country of Brazil’s income level and in comparison with its emerging-market peers. Government outlays on health care alone account for nearly 9% of GDP, the second largest item of spending following social protection. In health care, a number of conventional output indicators are not out of step with OECD averages. Following the decentralization of service delivery in the early 1990s, increasing emphasis has appropriately been placed on enhancing preventive care. But, in a decentralized setting, cost-effectiveness depends a great deal on the ability of service deliverers to exploit economies of scale and scope. Experience with inter-municipal initiatives for procurement, as well as flexible arrangements for hospital administration and human-resource management, is by and large positive.

Private Health Insurance is widely available in Brazil and may be purchased on an individual-basis or obtained as a work benefit (major employers usually offer private health insurance benefits). Public health care is still accessible for those who choose to obtain private health insurance. As of March 2007, more than 37 million Brazilians had some sort of private health insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ans.gov.br/portal/site/informacoesss/informacoesss.asp |title=Agência Nacional de Saúde Suplementar  |publisher=ANS TABNET|date=23 February 2007 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810061941/http://www.ans.gov.br/portal/site/informacoesss/informacoesss.asp |archivedate=10 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
{{main article|Healthcare in Chile}}

[[Chile]] has maintained a dual health care system in which its citizens can voluntarily opt for coverage by either the public National Health Insurance Fund or any of the country's private health insurance companies. 68% of the population is covered by the public fund and 18% by private companies. The remaining 14% is covered by other not-for-profit agencies or has no specific coverage. The system's duality has led to increasing inequalities prompting the Chilean government to introduce major reforms in health care provision. Chile's health care system is funded by a universal income tax deduction equal to 7% of every worker's wage. Many private health insurance companies encourage people to pay a variable extra on top of the 7% premium to upgrade their basic health plans. Because of this arrangement, the public and private health subsystems have existed almost completely separate from each other rather than coordinating to achieve common health objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/reprint/179/12/1289.pdf|title=untitled&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colombia===
{{main article|Healthcare in Colombia}}

===Paraguay===
{{Main article|Health in Paraguay}}

In terms of major indicators, [[health in Paraguay]] ranks near the median among [[South America]]n countries. In 2003 [[Paraguay]] had a [[child mortality]] rate of 1.5 deaths per 1,000 children, ranking it behind [[Argentina]], [[Colombia]], and [[Uruguay]] but ahead of [[Brazil]] and [[Bolivia]]. The health of Paraguayans living outside urban areas is generally worse than those residing in cities. Many preventable diseases, such as [[Chagas' disease]], run rampant in rural regions. Parasitic and respiratory diseases, which could be controlled with proper medical treatment, drag down Paraguay's overall health. In general, [[malnutrition]], lack of proper health care, and poor [[sanitation]] are the root of many health problems in Paraguay.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Paraguay.pdf Paraguay country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (October 2005). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

Health care funding from the national government increased gradually throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Spending on health care rose to 1.7 percent of the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 2000, nearly triple the 0.6 percent of GDP spent in 1989. But during the past decade, improvement in health care has slowed. Paraguay spends less per capita (US$13−20 per year) than most other Latin American countries. A 2001 survey indicated that 27 percent of the population still had no access to medical care, public or private. Private health insurance is very limited, with pre-paid plans making up only 11 percent of private expenditures on health care. Thus, most of the money spent on private health care (about 88 percent) is on a fee-for-service basis, effectively preventing the poor population from seeing private doctors. According to recent estimates, Paraguay has about 117 [[physician]]s and 20 [[nurse]]s per 100,000 population.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

===Peru===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Peru}}

Peruvian citizens can opt between a state-owned healthcare system and various private insurance companies. The country has a life expectancy higher than the global average but it also has a high risk of infection, especially near the jungle and other isolated areas, due to the warm climate that favours the reproduction of various insects and bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pe.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mortality rate of the population has been decreasing steadily since 1990 and now stands at 19 deaths per 1000 live births.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

===Venezuela===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Venezuela}}

The right to health care is guaranteed in the Venezuelan Constitution. Government campaigns for the prevention, elimination, and control of major health hazards have been generally successful. Immunization campaigns have systematically improved children's health, and regular campaigns to destroy disease-bearing insects and to improve water and sanitary facilities have all boosted Venezuela's health indicators to some of the highest levels in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/venezuela/20.htm|title=Health and Social Security|accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of low- or no-cost health care provided by the Venezuelan Institute of Social Security has also made Venezuela's health care infrastructure one of the more advanced in the region. However, despite being the most comprehensive and well funded in the region, the health care system has deteriorated sharply since the 1980s. Government expenditures on health care constituted an estimated 4.1 percent of gross domestic product in 2002. Total health expenditures per capita in 2001 totaled US$386. Per capita government expenditures on health in 2001 totaled US$240.

In April 2017 Venezuela’s health ministry reported that maternal mortality jumped by 65% in 2016 and that the number of infant deaths rose by 30%.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/world-week/21721971-politics-week|title=Politics this week|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also said that the number of cases of malaria was up by 76%.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt; The ministry had not reported health data in two years. Venezuela is suffering from acute shortages of food and medicines.

Though termed "immigrants," this group includes a large body of noncitizens, such as foreign students, migrant workers, permanent legal residents, and those without legal documentation.&lt;ref name=Footracer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Footracer|first=Katherine|title=Immigrant health care in the United States: What ails our system?|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Physician Assistants|date=13 April 2009|volume=22|issue=4|pages=33–37|url=http://www.jaapa.com/immigrant-health-care-in-the-united-states-what-ails-our-system/article/130524/|doi=10.1097/01720610-200904000-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data indicates that the United States’ immigrant population was 28.4 million in 2000, although the Population Reference Bureau has since reported an increase to roughly 40 million in 2010.&lt;ref name="Mohanty2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=PRB&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Philip|author2=Elizabeth Midgley|title=Population Bulletin Update: Immigration in America 2010|date=June 2010|url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/PopulationBulletins/2010/immigrationupdate1.aspx|publisher=Population Reference Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the influx of immigrants into the States has been 1.7 million in 2014, indicating a constant flow of immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Eleanor|date=|title=Immigrant Health in the United States|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1043659616672534|journal=Journal of Transcultural Nursing|volume=27|pages=611–626|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Census Bureau projects that this number will continue to increase in the next decade, with the country’s Southeastern and Mountain regions' immigrant populations growing especially fast.&lt;ref name=FC&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fremstad|first=Shawn|author2=Laura Cox|title=Covering New Americans: A Review of Federal and State Policies Related to Immigrants' Eligibility and Access to Publicly Funded Health Insurance|journal=Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured|date=November 2004|url=http://www.kff.org/medicaid/upload/Covering-New-Americans-A-Review-of-Federal-and-State-Policies-Related-to-Immigrants-Eligibility-and-Access-to-Publicly-Funded-Health-Insurance-Report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its impact on the country’s demographics and labor market, this rise in the immigrant population has had a disparate impact on the United States' health care system and its surrounding dialogue.

=== Health care providers ===

The health care system in the United States is made up of both public and private insurers, with the private sphere generally dominating in providing coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chua|first=Kao-Ping|title=Overview of the U.S. Health Care System|date=10 February 2006|url=http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Libraries/Committee_Docs/HealthCareSystemOverview.sflb.ashx|publisher=American Medical Student Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the federal government remains important given its role in determining public health benefits—for instance, [[Medicaid]], the United States health program for families and individuals of low income. Although Medicaid previously serviced immigrants, welfare reform policies such as the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act]] (PRWORA) in 1996 implemented stricter conditions for eligibility. This legislative move largely shifted responsibility for immigrant health care from the federal government to the state and local levels; as such, its impact varies across states. Generally, the provisions of PRWORA prevent immigrants from accessing federal benefits like the [[State Children’s Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP) until after they have held lawful permanent residency for five years (except in cases of emergency).&lt;ref name="Footracer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gold"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gold|first=Rachel|title=Immigrants and Medicaid After Welfare Reform|journal=The Guttmacher Report on Public Policy|date=May 2003|volume=6|issue=2|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/tgr/06/2/gr060206.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, some states have implemented their own programs expanding health coverage to immigrants and other low-income groups; among these include states of [[Illinois]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[District of Columbia]], and some counties in  [[California]]. These services differ accordingly, with some providing the same coverage as Medicaid or SCHIP, while others limit coverage to specific categories of immigrants.&lt;ref name=FC/&gt; Conversely, other states like [[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Virginia]], have implemented laws that further restrict noncitizens' access to health care.&lt;ref name=Okie/&gt; Legislation of similar nature include the [[Deficit Reduction Act of 2005]], which requires proof of identity and U.S. citizenship from all those applying for/renewing Medicaid coverage.&lt;ref name=Okie&gt;{{cite journal|last=Okie|first=Susan|title=Immigrants and Health Care—At the Intersection of Two broken Systems|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=9 August 2007|pages=525–529|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp078113|doi=10.1056/NEJMp078113|volume=357|pmid=17687126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to PRWORA, the [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act]] (EMTALA) of 1985 provides emergency medical care to all, without any requirements of proof of citizenship or residency.&lt;ref name=Footracer/&gt; It declares that hospitals must screen and treat individuals until they are fit for release or stabilized for transfer.&lt;ref name=Cosman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cosman|first=Madeleine Pelner|title=Illegal Aliens and American Medicine|journal=Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons|year=2005|volume=10|issue=1|pages=6–10|url=http://www.jpands.org/vol10no1/cosman.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas like Washington D.C., uninsured immigrants receive [[outpatient care]] from public clinics and community health centers. However, the services offered by this type of health care tends to be uneven; for example, specialty services like Pap smears may be offered but not blood pressure tests or follow-up treatments.&lt;ref name=Okie/&gt;

Several municipalities in the United States offer [[Healthcare availability for undocumented immigrants in the United States|health care coverage for undocumented immigrants]], including [[Los Angeles County]]'s [[My Health LA]] program, and [[San Francisco]]'s [[Healthy San Francisco]].

== Findings and statistics ==
Since the enactment of PRWORA in 1996, the gap in health coverage between immigrants and citizens has grown considerably.&lt;ref name=FC /&gt; In addition to the context of welfare policy, however, immigrant access to health care is also governed by several other factors: socioeconomic background (e.g. educational attainment and occupation), language skills, immigration status, geographic location, and stigma.&lt;ref name="DEL"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Derose|first=Kathryn Pitkin|author2=Jose J. Escarce |author3=Nicole Lurie |title=Immigrants and Health Care: Sources of Vulnerability|journal=Health Affairs|date=September–October 2007|volume=26|issue=5|pages=1258–1268|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.26.5.1258}}&lt;/ref&gt; With two or more of these factors compounded together, health outcomes can vary substantially across individual families but regardless, they are considerably disadvantaged compared to U.S.-born citizens.

Immigrants, on average, use less than half the dollar amount of health care services that American-born citizens use, receiving about $1,797 per capita compared to their U.S.-born counterparts' $3,702.&lt;ref name=NILC&gt;{{cite journal|title=Facts About Immigrants' Low Use of Health Services and Public Benefits|journal=Immigrants' Rights Update|date=29 September 2006|volume=20|issue=5|url=http://www.nilc.org/research002.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IPC&gt;{{cite web|title=Sharing the Costs, Sharing the Benefits: Inclusion is the Best Medicine|url=http://immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/sharing-costs-sharing-benefits-inclusion-best-medicine|publisher=Immigration Policy Center|date=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, low-income immigrants are over two times more likely to lack health insurance than low-income citizens.&lt;ref name="Kaiser"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ku|first=Leighton|author2=Timothy Waidmann|title=How Race/Ethnicity, Immigration Status and Language Affect Health Insurance Coverage, Access to Care and Quality of Care Among the Low-Income Population|date=August 2003|publisher=Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, they have less interaction with the health care system, though incidences in which they do tend more likely to be through emergency departments.&lt;ref name=Footracer/&gt; Collected data indicates lower levels of heart disease, arthritis, depression, hypertension, asthma, and cancer among immigrants than U.S.-born citizens. Speculation behind this phenomenon looks towards the fact that the immigrant population is generally younger than the native-born population as a whole; others believe that these medical conditions simply have not yet been detected given the immigrants' lower rates of health coverage.&lt;ref name=Footracer/&gt;

Overall, analyses indicate that after factors such as health status, income, and race/ethnicity are controlled for, citizenship status plays a significant role in determining one's medical care access.&lt;ref name=KuMatani&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ku|first=Leighton|author2=Sheetal Matani|title=Left Out: Immigrants’ Access to Health Care and Insurance|journal=Immigrants' Access|date=January–February 2001|volume=20|issue=1|pages=247–256|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.20.1.247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noncitizen immigrants and their children are less likely to be insured, and the lack of insurance consequently reduces their ability to receive care. Naturalized citizens, on the other hand, generally receive the same level of health care access as U.S.-born citizens, implying that health care usage becomes more available with acculturation.&lt;ref name=KuMatani/&gt;

=== Children ===
Studies on the disparities between immigrants and citizens’ health care show an especially pronounced impact on children. Even if born in the United States, children of noncitizens tend to have poorer health. Not only are they more likely to be uninsured, but they also have less access to both medical and dental care.&lt;ref name=Huang/&gt; Children of immigrants are also less likely to have received proper immunizations than U.S.-born children.&lt;ref name=FC/&gt;

Furthermore, data collected from the [[National Health Interview Survey]] in a 1999 study indicates that foreign-born children are five times more likely than American-born children to lack a constant source of health care. Additional findings show that foreign-born children make less ambulatory and emergency visits to hospitals; however, they have considerably higher costs on average when they do, suggesting that immigrant children are sicker or more severely affected during emergencies.&lt;ref name="Mohanty2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Okie/&gt; This inference is drawn from their lower rates of outpatient/office-based visits.&lt;ref name="Mohanty2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohanty|first=Sarita|author2=Steffie Woolhandler |author3=David Himmelstein |author4=Sumita Pati |author5=Olveen Carrasquillo |author6=David Bor |title=Health Care Expenditures of Immigrants in the United States: A Nationally Representative Analysis|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=August 2005|volume=95|issue=8|pages=1431–1438|pmc=1449377|pmid=16043671|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.044602}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mohanty1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mohanty|first=Sarita|title=Unequal Access: Immigrants And US Health Care|url=http://www.ilw.com/articles/2006,0719-mohanty.shtm|publisher=Immigration Daily|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study done in Los Angeles County in 2000 shows how children's immigration status is associated with access to insurance as well as their health status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gelatt|first=Julia|date=2016-09-01|title=Immigration Status and the Healthcare Access and health of Children of Immigrants|url=|journal=Social Science Quarterly|volume=97|pages=540–554|doi=10.1111/ssqu.12261|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that children under undocumented parents had many obstacles when trying to access and utilize healthcare.

In US, there are two ways to get insurance, either from the government aid or from private insurance. Since they are undocumented, they cannot get the aid from the state government nor can they access private insurance companies due to its high price or because it is not offered by their employer. Therefore, their offspring also do not have access to private insurance.

=== Hispanics and Latinos ===
Though no precise data on the undocumented immigrant population is available, estimates in 2009 suggest that 70% are from either Mexico or Central America.&lt;ref name=Blewett /&gt; Because [[Hispanic]]s comprise a major proportion of the U.S.'s immigrant and noncitizen population, a more extensive body of research has been collected about their status in obtaining and receiving health care services. In order to receive effective healthcare, it is important for individuals to understand the US healthcare system.

A study was conducted by Pew Hispanic Center in 2007 in order to further bring attention to this issue of health literacy among Latino immigrant communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calvo|first=Rocío|date=Feb 2016|title=Health Literacy and Quality of Care among Latino Immigrants in the United States|url=|journal=Health &amp; Social Work|volume=41|pages=|doi=10.1093/hsw/hlv076|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2996 participants were randomly selected by looking at phone lists within areas that were predominantly Latino. During phone surveys, participants were asked about their general background information such as age, gender, and ethnicities and about their experiences in healthcare settings. The results showed that factors determining quality of care were the years they've been in the States, income level, education status, health insurance status, and health literacy. Among many immigrant groups, Latino communities tend to undergo challenges in healthcare settings and receive lower quality of care than other ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Derose|first=Kathryn|date=2009|title=Review: Immigrants and health care access, quality, and cost|url=|journal=Health Affairs|volume=66|pages=355–408|doi=10.1177/1077558708330425|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is crucial to raise awareness of the importance of health literacy, in order to bring up the quality of care in healthcare settings among Latinos. It will result in overall better health system among immigrants in the United States, since Latinos make up a large percentage, about 70%, of immigrants.&lt;ref name="Blewett" /&gt;

Another data indicates that they have the highest rate of uninsurance among all ethnic groups—33% compared to the national average of 15%.&lt;ref name="FamUSA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Coverage in Latino Communities: What’s the problem and what can you do about it?|url=http://familiesusa2.org/assets/pdfs/Hispanic2783.pdf|publisher=Families USA|date=December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to citizens with similar wages, hours, or occupations, Hispanic non-citizens were half to two-thirds less likely to be offered health coverage in the workplace.&lt;ref name="FC" /&gt; Moreover, further studies even show that regardless of immigration status, Hispanics have less access to health care services than white citizens overall.&lt;ref name="KuMatani" /&gt; Findings indicate that a large body of Hispanic and Latino Americans have similar or better outcomes than the average population—a phenomenon that has been labeled the “[[Hispanic paradox]]”.&lt;ref name="TRPI"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taningo|first=Maria Teresa|title=Revisiting the Latino Health Paradox|date=August 2007|url=http://www.trpi.org/PDFs/Latino%20Paradox%20Aug%202007%20PDF.pdf|publisher=Tomas Rivera Policy Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research indicates that this paradox exists only on some health measures; for example, Hispanic immigrants are healthier in terms of blood pressure and heart disease than non-immigrant non-Hispanic whites, but are more likely to be overweight or obese and have diabetes.&lt;ref name="TRPI" /&gt;

=== Asians ===

The Asian immigrant population encompasses many subgroups, though extensive information on any specific one is fairly limited. Contrary to findings on Hispanic immigrants, they generally tend to have household incomes similar to or higher than European immigrants. Their coverage rates vary, however, some Asian subgroups match European immigrants but others like Vietnamese and Koreans had rates of over 30% of uninsurance.&lt;ref name=Carrasquillo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carrasquillo|first=Olveen|author2=Angeles Carrasquillo |author3=Steven Shea |title=Health Insurance Coverage of Immigrants Living in the United States: Differences by Citizenship Status and Country of Origin|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=June 2000|volume=90|issue=6|pages=917–923|pmc=1446276|pmid=10846509|doi=10.2105/ajph.90.6.917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional research indicates that compared to other ethnic groups, Asian children receive the poorest quality of primary care.&lt;ref name="Yu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yu|first=Stella M.|author2=Zhihuan Huang |author3=Gopal Singh |title=Health Status and Health Services Utilization Among US Chinese, Asian Indian, Filipino, and Other Asian/Pacific Islander Children|journal=Pediatrics|date=January 2004|volume=113|issue=1|pages=101–107|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/1/101.full.html|doi=10.1542/peds.113.1.101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the tendency for less health care access than non-Hispanic white citizens, Asian ethnicity and immigrant status are correlated with better health and higher school attendance among children.&lt;ref name="Yu" /&gt; However, this observation of "better health" may be due to less diagnosis as a result of less health care utilization. Others also suggest that the higher rates of school attendance among Asian children may result from cultural values that prioritize education.&lt;ref name="Yu" /&gt;

Because Asian immigrants often continue to practice [[alternative medicine]] after migration, cultural health beliefs contribute to disparities in medical care access. For instance, the practice of [[gua sha]], or coin rubbing, to treat various physical ailments exists in Vietnamese, Chinese, Indonesian, and other cultures. Similarly, other healing techniques like [[fire cupping]] are used.&lt;ref name=Houston&gt;{{cite journal|last=Houston|first=Rika|author2=Alladi Venkatesh|title=The Health Care Consumption Patterns of Asian Immigrants: Grounded Theory Implications for Consumer Acculturation Theory|journal=Advances in Consumer Research|year=1996|volume=23|pages=418–429|url=The Health Care Consumption Patterns of Asian Immigrants: Grounded Theory Implications for Consumer Acculturation Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, Asian immigrants’ perceived need of formal health care services is often lower, as some believe their alternative healing methods are more effective than prescription medicines.

Different expectations of the consumer/provider relationship also derail Asian immigrants from seeking U.S. health care providers’ services. In addition to language barriers, some Asian subgroups emphasize a higher level of trust between health care practitioners and patients, and as a result, may feel alienated using the more formalized American health care system.&lt;ref name=Houston /&gt;

Culture assimilation can also be a factor in how often immigrants use healthcare services. A study was conducted by Huabin Luo and Bei Wu to see if there is a relationship between the usage of dental service and culture assimilation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luo|first=Huabin|date=December 2016|title=Acculturation and Dental Service Use Among Asian Immigrants in the U.S|url=|journal=Journal of Preventive Medicine|volume=51|pages=939–946|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2016.07.041|via=Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results showed that length of stay and English proficiency were the two factors that determined Asian immigrants' visit to dental clinics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Specifics and significance of this study will be further discussed in the Challenges: Social Barriers section below.

Another cross-sectional study among Chinese immigrants has shown that English proficiency as well as print health literacy is crucial in determining immigrants' health status.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsoh|first=Janice|date=January 2016|title=Healthcare Communication Barriers and Self-Rated Health in Older Chinese American Immigrants|url=|journal=Journal of Community Health|volume=1|pages=741–752|doi=10.1007/s10900-015-0148-4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have collected survey from 705 Chinese-American immigrants. Some questions that were included in the survey were, "How do you rate your own English proficiency?," "Have you ever had to get help for medical interpretation?," and "Can you understand medical information or instructions by yourself?"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 96.2% had poor English proficiency and 65.7% had rated themselves having poor health.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Further discussions regarding the association between barriers and healthcare will be discussed in the Challenges section below.

== Challenges ==
Restrictions based on immigration status are not the only obstacles to obtaining health care; the challenges that impede immigrants from accessing services are both structural and social. Even immigrants who are eligible for health benefits are less likely to receive them than U.S. citizens.&lt;ref name="NILC" /&gt;

=== Structural barriers ===
The lack of health insurance is a major reason behind immigrants’ low usage of the United States health care services.&lt;ref name="Mohanty1" /&gt; The [[Survey of Income and Program Participation]] (SIPP) indicated that in 2002, 13.4% of native-born citizens were not insured compared to 43.8% of foreign-born adults.&lt;ref name="Footracer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mohanty1" /&gt; Reasons for uninsurance vary, but the findings of a 2005 study suggest that personal characteristics as well as the types of jobs immigrants have factor largely into the lack of coverage. For instance, there is a high concentration of immigrants in low-paying jobs and other jobs that do not offer health insurance. Personal characteristics that stem from structural obstacles include education; both immigrants and native-born citizens who have lower levels of education tend to be uninsured.&lt;ref name="Mohanty1" /&gt;

Additionally, citizenship status is significant in determining one’s health care access, especially that of children. Health benefits are largely contingent on immigrant parents in that although a child may be born in the U.S., the naturalization process for adults can take between 5 and 10 years.&lt;ref name=Huang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huang|first=Jennifer|author2=Stella Yu |author3=Rebecca Ledsky |title=Health Status and Health Service Access and Use Among Children in U.S. Immigrant Families|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=April 2006|volume=96|issue=4|pages=634–640|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2004.049791|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.049791|pmc=1470552}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since welfare reform initiatives like the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act have been enacted, states have seen an overall decline in the number of children being vaccinated.&lt;ref name=Footracer /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gold /&gt;

Finally, the financial costs of health coverage may also explain uninsurance. Studies have shown a connection between the lack of coverage and higher poverty rates.&lt;ref name=Footracer /&gt;

=== Social barriers ===
Access to and usage of health care depends in part on immigrants’ level of acculturation. Linguistic difficulties can prevent immigrants from accessing health care in two major ways.&lt;ref name="Huang" /&gt; First, English proficiency is necessary to complete health insurance forms and to effectively communicate medical problems with physicians; as such, difficulty in obtaining language assistance or translated private/public health insurance forms makes the process of getting coverage a more intimidating and discouraging ordeal. For instance, a data of 507 Korean immigrants showed that more than 50% of participants have at least experienced one obstacle in terms of utilizing healthcare in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jang|first=Sou Hyun|date=|title=First-generation Korean immigrants' barriers to healthcare and their coping strategies in the US|url=|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=168|pages=93–100|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.09.007|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among many obstacles, language was one of the biggest barrier and uninsurance the second largest factor.  Second, language skills impact one’s available job opportunities. Without an adequate level of English proficiency, immigrants are constrained to certain jobs, often those that are less likely to provide job-based insurance.&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt;

As mentioned, language can be a huge barrier to immigrants when it comes to accessing healthcare, especially because of complex medical terminology. A study (already mentioned in the last paragraph of the Findings and statistics: Asian Section) done among Chinese immigrants have shown significant positive association between language barriers and poor self-rated health.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsoh|first=Janice|date=January 2016|title=Healthcare Communication Barriers and Self-Rated Health in Older Chinese American Immigrants|url=|journal=Journal of Community Health|volume=41|pages=741–752|doi=10.1007/s10900-015-0148-4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, poorly rated their health status was common among immigrants that had limited English proficiency as well as health literacy.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This study emphasizes how language barrier is taking a large bulk of healthcare access among immigrants. Also, it suggests ways in which we, as a community, can collectively improve and get rid of these language barriers so that more immigrants can get proper access to healthcare.

There is also a climate of fear and distrust that prevents immigrants, especially those without documentation, from actively seeking out health services. Fear arises largely from the idea of risking deportation or becoming ineligible for citizenship.&lt;ref name="Huang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mohanty1" /&gt; Although the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] has stated that receiving Medicaid or SCHIP benefits (with the exception of long-term care) does not jeopardize residency status, many immigrants are still unaware and perceive otherwise.&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt; This misunderstanding of policies may also be subsequently compounded with the lack of knowledge about what health services are available.

Finally, some research indicates that barriers may exist according to a group’s cultural beliefs. For example, Southeast Asians tend to be less forthcoming in seeking health care because their cultural norms describe pain and sickness as an inevitable part of life. Additionally, their value of stoicism and differences in etiology (e.g. beliefs in [[yin and yang]], [[Qi|chi]], etc.) may further undermine their perceived practicality of Western health care.&lt;ref name=Uba&gt;{{cite journal|last=Uba|first=Laura|title=Cultural Barriers to Health Care for Southeast Asian Refugees|journal=Public Health Reports |date=September–October 1992|volume=107|issue=5|pages=544–548}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, different immigrant groups vary in whether or not they actively seek out health services.

Immigrant groups' cultural beliefs are different, thus sometimes they have hard time assimilating themselves into a new culture. A study (already mentioned in the second to last paragraph of the Findings and statistics: Asian Section) has shown that the length of stay had the strongest association with Asian immigrants getting their dental check-ups.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luo|first=Huabin|date=December 2016|title=Acculturation and Dental Service Use Among Asian Immigrants in the U.S|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/science/article/pii/S0749379716303774?via%3Dihub|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|volume=51|pages=939–946|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2016.07.041|via=Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the longer immigrants were to stay in the us, the more likely they were to get medical check-ups because they were already familiarized themselves with how healthcare system runs in the United States. Although this study was only confined to dental visits, the results are still significant because not only it showed that acculturation plays a crucial role in immigrants' healthcare access, but also showed potential ways in which how communities and health professionals can approach and eradicate these social barriers. For instance, creating a program among immigrants to learn about US healthcare system in their native languages can make immigrants familiar with complex US healthcare system. Also, immigrants can build social support network through these programs, which can be a great help when it comes to facing health issues.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Public opinion ==
Disparities in health care coverage between immigrants and native-born residents have risen in part from policy changes such as PRWORA in determining eligibility for Medicaid and other public benefits.&lt;ref name="Gold" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt; They have subsequently contributed to much debate over whether reform is necessary to address these inequalities and the state of immigrant health outreach, resulting in immigration’s emergence as a hot-button issue.

=== Debate ===

==== Support for immigrant health care benefits ====
The case for addressing problems in immigrant health care includes a large body of both moral and economic reasoning. Proponents of immigrant health care reform contend that children of immigrant families are like native-born children in their need for security in health and nutrition. Given their role in the nation’s future—e.g. in the workforce, military, etc.—they argue that the current state of health care access does not appropriately reflect national interest.&lt;ref name="NILC" /&gt; Because immigrants will directly impact health care as a part of the health sector’s work force, their inclusion in receiving benefits is necessary in servicing the expanding population.&lt;ref name=Ewing&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ewing|first=Walter A.|title=The Future of a Generation: How New Americans Will Help Support Retiring Baby Boomers.|date=February 2012|publisher=Immigration Policy Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, because general health care is underutilized, emergency medical care becomes the priority. This ultimately results in delays in major diagnoses until the later stages of an affliction, thereby increasing a community’s level of disease.&lt;ref name=Footracer /&gt; Moreover, others argue that it is unfair that immigrants have contributed a number of tax dollars to fund public benefits, yet are not taking advantage of them.

A fact report published by the Immigration Policy Center in 2009 also suggests that increased immigrant participation in the United States’ health care system yields monetary benefits.&lt;ref name=IPC /&gt; Due to the nation’s [[baby boom]] phenomenon, a greater proportion of the population is aging, thus demanding more health care. A change in eligibility requirements to include immigrants and noncitizens in the health care system would spread the costs of sustaining public benefits; more tax dollars would be available to alleviate the financial strain of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].&lt;ref name=Ewing /&gt;

==== Opposition to immigrant health care benefits ====
Conversely, others argue that immigrants to the United States intend to take advantage of public benefits and therefore favor legislation that implements more restrictions.&lt;ref name=Singer&gt;{{cite web|last=Singer|first=Audrey|title=Immigrants, Welfare Reform and the Coming Reauthorization Vote|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/feature/display.cfm?ID=40|publisher=Migration Information Source|date=August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, some believe that health care benefits should be limited given their burden on the federal budget.&lt;ref name=Singer /&gt; There is some concern from this side that legislative acts like EMTALA, in ensuring emergency medical care to all, lack clarity in defining what constitutes an “emergency.” As such, minor health issues such as migraines—as opposed to emergencies like gunshot wounds and cardiac arrest—are included and hurt hospitals due to the lack of additional government compensation.&lt;ref name=Footracer /&gt;

Some opponents also raise caution at increasing immigrant health care benefits due to the conception of immigrants/ noncitizens and their role in criminal violence.&lt;ref name=Cosman /&gt; Though this view generalizes a large body of individuals, reports of cities with large illegal immigrant populations and high crime rates—e.g. Los Angeles—indicate a connection between immigrant gangs and emergency medical care cases. Because EMTALA obligates treatment, these incidents are taken care of but ultimately result in substantial financial loss. Opponents on this basis not only argue against increased immigrant health care benefits but also generally believe that U.S. [[immigration law]] should be more stringent.&lt;ref name=Cosman /&gt;

=== Policy challenges and proposed solutions ===
Efforts at reforming the health care system in regards to immigrants have varied in terms of success in the past decade. In 2003, the federal government proposed funding hospitals over a four-year period to cover emergency treatment for uninsured and undocumented immigrants, but required asking for patients’ citizenship statuses.&lt;ref name=Footracer /&gt; It was ultimately withdrawn due to the belief that such a policy would delay immigrants from actively seeking care unless in extreme need, thereby contributing to overall higher incidences of medical problems in a community. In 2005 and 2006, proposed Senate and House of Representatives bills sought to decrease illegal immigration but additionally made it a felony for health care providers to service undocumented immigrants.&lt;ref name=Footracer /&gt; Though the bills did not pass, much discourse erupted from health care organizations in response to them. The [[American Medical Association]] notably passed a policy called “Opposition to Criminalization of Medical Care Provided to Undocumented Immigrant Patients” in response.&lt;ref name=Footracer /&gt;

Other policy solutions focus on allocating more funds to community health centers and to SCHIP and/or state programs.&lt;ref name=DEL /&gt; Similarly, another proposal specifically targets increased funding for prenatal care, with studies showing that this kind of preventative care acts as a cost-effective solution to overall health care costs.&lt;ref name=Footracer /&gt; Greater public funding for prenatal care of immigrants and noncitizens would decrease low-birth-weight babies, prematurity, and other related costs, thereby lowering health care expenditures. Finally, policies making insurance more affordable for workers could potentially reduce coverage disparities, given that a large proportion of immigrants are less likely to be covered than native-born citizens.&lt;ref name=DEL /&gt;

In addition to proposed reform bills, alternative routes to improving health coverage rates have been sought, namely via the means of direct immigrant outreach initiatives. Studies indicate the overall effectiveness of state-funded coverage programs in reducing the immigrant-citizen health care disparities, but other efforts have been suggested for further results.&lt;ref name=FC /&gt; For instance, states can encourage and promoter greater use of health services by reducing enrollment barriers—e.g. dispersing more information about eligibility, reducing language difficulties, etc.&lt;ref name=FC /&gt; To address specific cultural impediments, others purport that health care providers should receive more education about communication patterns, others’ perceptions of health and fatality, and traditional folk medicines.&lt;ref name=Uba /&gt; Overall, continued outreach efforts are necessary to overcome immigrant skepticism of Western technology and diagnostic methods.

== Recent legislation ==

On March 23, 2010, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA) was signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]. This legislation, joined with the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]], seeks to expand coverage and improve access to the health care system while simultaneously managing its costs.&lt;ref name=KaiserReport&gt;{{cite journal|title=Summary of New Health Reform Law|date=15 April 2011|url=http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/8061.pdf|publisher=Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among PPACA’s provisions are: the requirement that all U.S. citizens and legal residents possess health insurance; the creation of refundable tax credits for households between 100% and 400% of the [[Poverty thresholds (United States Census Bureau)|federal poverty line]]; the expansion of Medicaid eligibility; the provision of free preventative services; the extension of dependent coverage to age 26; new funding to support community health centers; and more.&lt;ref name=KaiserReport /&gt;&lt;ref name=DPC&gt;{{cite web|title=The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act: Detailed Summary|url=http://dpc.senate.gov/healthreformbill/healthbill04.pdf|publisher=Democratic Policy and Communications Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not all of the act’s reforms are slated for immediate implementation, the changes, needless to say, have many implications for the immigrant and noncitizen population.&lt;ref name=HCgov&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Features of the Affordable Care Act, By Year|url=http://www.healthcare.gov/law/timeline/full.html|publisher=HealthCare.gov|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PPACA’s creation of subsidies to make insurance more affordable notably benefits legal immigrants, given that they comprise a large number of the uninsured population. In contrast, undocumented immigrants are denied these subsidies and further prohibited from participating in federal or state health insurance exchanges, though their lawfully present children will be eligible.&lt;ref name=Abascal&gt;{{cite news|last=Abascal|first=Maria|title=Reform's Mixed Impact on Immigrants|url=http://prospect.org/article/reforms-mixed-impact-immigrants-0|newspaper=The American Prospect|date=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blewett&gt;{{cite web|last=Blewett|first=Lynn|title=Left Behind: Undocumented Immigrants under the Affordable Care Act|url=http://www.nashpconference.org/wp-content/uploads/Left-Behind-Undocumented-Immigrants-under-the-Affordable-Care-Act.pdf|publisher=State Health Access Data Assistance Center|date=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of citizenship status, however, PPACA’s funding for the development of new community health centers has the potential to help both legal and undocumented immigrants who lack coverage.

Views on the act’s contributions to the immigrant and noncitizen population vary. Some argue that the reform has immense benefits by addressing coverage gaps and extending more benefits to naturalized citizens. Others argue that substantial disparities still exist, with an estimated 3.7 million adults remaining uninsured due to their undocumented status.&lt;ref name=Blewett /&gt; Furthermore, because the act does not address the five-year waiting period placed by PRWORA, more recent low-income legal immigrants may not seek insurance “for want of resources to pay their share of the costs.”&lt;ref name=Abascal /&gt;

'''Indicator bacteria''' are types of [[bacteria]] used to detect and estimate the level of fecal contamination of water. They are not dangerous to human health but are used to indicate the presence of a health risk.

Each gram of human [[feces]] contains approximately ~100 billion ({{val|1|e=11}}) bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beactiviahealth|title=Intestinal Microflora|url=http://www.beactiviahealth.com/html_cap/1_3.html|work=Activia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231216/http://www.beactiviahealth.com/html_cap/1_3.html|archivedate=2012-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These bacteria may include species of [[pathogenic]] bacteria, such as ''[[Salmonella]]'' or ''[[Campylobacter]]'', associated with [[gastroenteritis]]. In addition, feces may contain pathogenic [[virus]]es, [[protozoa]] and [[parasitism|parasites]]. Fecal material can enter the environment from many sources including [[waste water treatment plants]], livestock or poultry manure, sanitary landfills, [[septic systems]], [[sewage sludge]], pets and wildlife. If sufficient quantities are ingested, fecal pathogens can cause disease. The variety and often low concentrations of pathogens in environmental waters makes them difficult to test for individually. Public agencies therefore use the presence of other more abundant and more easily detected fecal bacteria as indicators of the presence of fecal contamination.

== Criteria for indicator organisms== 
The [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) lists the following criteria for an organism to be an ideal indicator of fecal contamination:{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}
# The organism should be present whenever enteric pathogens are present
# The organism should be useful for all types of water
# The organism should have a longer survival time than the hardiest enteric pathogen
# The organism should not grow in water
# The organism should be found in warm-blooded animals’ intestines.

None of the types of indicator organisms that are currently in use fit all of these criteria perfectly, however, when cost is considered, use of indicators becomes necessary.

== Types of indicator organisms ==
Commonly used indicator bacteria include total coliforms, or a subset of this group, [[fecal coliforms]], which are found in the intestinal tracts of warm blooded animals. Total coliforms were used as fecal indicators by public agencies in the US as early as the 1920s.  These organisms can be identified based on the fact that they all metabolize the sugar lactose, producing both acid and gas as byproducts.  Fecal coliforms are more useful as indicators in recreational waters than total coliforms which include species that are naturally found in plants and soil; however, there are even some species of fecal coliforms that do not have a fecal origin, such as ''Klebsiella pneumoniae''.  Perhaps the biggest drawback to using coliforms as indicators is that they can grow in water under certain conditions.

''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli'') and [[enterococci]] are also used as indicators.

==Current methods of detection==

===Membrane filtration and culture on selective media===
[[File:Enterococci colonies.JPG|right|thumb|Enterococci colonies growing on a selective agar after membrane filtration.]]
Indicator bacteria can be [[Bacterial culture|cultured]] on [[Growth medium|media]] which are specifically formulated to allow the growth of the species of interest and inhibit growth of other organisms.  Typically, environmental water samples are filtered through membranes with small pore sizes and then the membrane is placed onto a selective agar.  It is often necessary to vary the volume of water sample filtered in order to prevent too few or too many colonies from forming on a plate. Bacterial colonies can be counted after 24 to 48 hours depending on the type of bacteria. Counts are reported as colony forming units per 100 mL (cfu/100 mL).

===Fast detections using chromogenic substances===
One technique for detecting indicator organisms is the use of chromogenic compounds, which are added to conventional or newly devised media used for isolation of the indicator bacteria. These chromogenic compounds are modified to change color or fluorescence by the addition of either enzymes or specific bacterial metabolites. This enables for easy detection and avoids the need for isolation of pure cultures and confirmatory tests.&lt;ref name="Ashbolt"&gt;Ashbolt, N., Snozzi, G. and M. (2001). Water Quality: Guidelines, Standards and Health. World Health Organization (WHO). Chapter 13: Indicators of Microbial Water Quality. p. 289-316&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application of antibodies===
Immunological methods using [[monoclonal antibodies]] can be used to detect indicator bacteria in water samples. Precultivation in select medium must preface detection to avoid detection of dead cells. [[ELISA]] antibody technology has been developed to allow for readable detection by the naked eye for rapid identification of coliform [[microcolony|microcolonies]]. Other uses of antibodies in detection use magnetic beads coated with antibodies for the concentration and separation of the [[oocysts]] and [[cysts]] as described below for immunomagnetic separationz (IMS) methods.&lt;ref name="Ashbolt"  /&gt;

===IMS/culture and other rapid culture-based methods===
Immunomagnetic separation involves purified antigens biotinylated and bound to streptoavidin-coated paramagnetic particles. The raw sample is mixed with the beads, then a specific magnet is used to hold the target organisms against the vial wall and the non-bound material is poured off. This method can be used to recover specific indicator bacteria.&lt;ref name="Ashbolt"  /&gt;

===Gene sequence-based methods===
Gene sequence-based methods depend on the recognition of exclusive gene sequences particular to specific strains of organisms. [[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) and [[fluorescence in situ hybridization]] (FISH) are gene sequence-based methods currently being used to detect specific strains of indicator bacteria.&lt;ref name="Ashbolt"  /&gt;

== Water quality standards for bacteria ==

=== Drinking water standards ===
[[World Health Organization]] Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality state that as an indicator organism ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' provides conclusive evidence of recent fecal [[water pollution|pollution]] and should ''not'' be present in water meant for human consumption. In the U.S., the EPA ''Total Coliform Rule'' states that a water system is out of compliance if more than 5 percent of its monthly water samples contain coliforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location= Washington, DC |title=Drinking Water; National Primary Drinking Water Regulations; Total Coliforms |url=http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/tcr/upload/tcr1989.pdf|date=1989-06-29}} {{Federal Register|54|27544}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recreational standards ===
Early studies showed that individuals who swam in waters with geometric mean coliform densities above 2300/100 mL for three days had higher illness rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stevenson |first=A |title=Studies of Bathing Water Quality and Health |journal=American journal of public health and the nation's health |year=1953 |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=529–538 |doi=10.2105/ajph.43.5_pt_1.529|pmc=1620266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, these numbers were converted to fecal coliform concentrations assuming 18 percent of total coliforms were fecal. Consequently, the National Technical Advisory Committee in the US recommended the following standard for recreational waters in 1968: 10 percent of total samples during any 30-day period should not exceed 400 fecal coliforms/100 mL or a log mean of 200/100 mL (based on a minimum of 5 samples taken over not more than a 30-day period).&lt;ref name="water.epa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|author=EPA |title=Ambient Water Quality Criteria for Bacteria - 1986 |year=1986 |url=http://water.epa.gov/scitech/swguidance/standards/upload/2009_04_13_beaches_1986crit.pdf}} Document no. EPA-440/5-84-002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite criticism, EPA recommended this criterion again in 1976, however, the Agency initiated numerous studies in the 1970s and 1980s to overcome the weaknesses of the earlier studies. In 1986, EPA revised its bacteriological ambient water quality criteria recommendations to include ''E. coli'' and enterococci.

Canada’s National Agri-Environmental Standards Initiative’s approach to characterizing risks associated with fecal water pollution bacterial water quality at agricultural sites is to compare these sites with those at reference sites away from human or livestock sources.  This approach generally results in lower levels if ''E. coli'' being used as a standard or “benchmark” based on a study that indicated pathogens were detected in 80% of water samples with less than 100 cfu ''E. coli'' per 100 mL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edge|first1=TA|first2=A. |last2=El-Shaarawi |first3=V. |last3=Gannon |first4=C. |last4=Jokinen |first5=R. |last5=Kent |first6=I.U.H. |last6=Khan |first7=W. |last7=Koning |first8=D. |last8=Lapen |first9=J. |last9=Miller |first10=N. |last10=Neumann |first11=R. |last11=Phillips |first12=W. |last12=Robertson |first13=H. |last13=Schreier |first14=A. |last14=Scott |first15=I. |last15=Shtepani |first16=E. |last16=Topp |first17=G. |last17=Wilkes |first18=E. |last18=van Bochove|title=Investigation of an esherischi coli Environmental Benchmark for Waterborne Pathogens in Agricultural Watersheds in Canada|journal=Journal of Environmental Quality|year=2011|volume=40|pages=x-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risk assessment for exposure to pathogens in recreational waters ==
Most cases of bacterial gastroenteritis are caused by food-borne enteric microorganisms, such as ''[[Salmonella]]'' and ''[[Campylobacter]]''; however, it is also important to understand the risk of exposure to pathogens via recreational waters.  This is especially the case in watersheds where human or animal wastes are discharged to streams and downstream waters are used for swimming or other recreational activities. Other important pathogens other than bacteria include viruses such as [[rotavirus]], [[hepatitis A]] and [[hepatitis E]] and protozoa like [[giardia]], [[cryptosporidium]] and ''[[Naegleria fowleri]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Waterborne Pathogens|url=http://waterbornepathogens.susana.org/|publisher=Montana State|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the difficulties associated with monitoring pathogens in the environment, risk assessments often rely on the use of indicator bacteria.  
[[File:Nrborderborderentrythreecolorsmay05-1-.JPG|right|thumb|The [[New River (Mexico–United States)|New River]] as it enters [[California]] is dark green, white (foam), and milky brown/green. [[Fecal coliforms]] and fecal [[streptococci]] have been consistently detected in the New River at the [[Mexico-US border]].]]

=== Epidemiological studies ===
In the 1950s, a series of epidemiological studies were done in the US to determine the relationship between water quality of natural waters and the health of bathers. The results indicated that swimmers were more likely to have gastrointestinal symptoms, eye infections, skin complaints, ear, nose, and throat infections and respiratory illness than non-swimmers and in some cases, higher coliform levels correlated to higher incidence of gastrointestinal illness, although the sample sizes in these studies were small.  Since then, studies have been done to confirm causative relations between swimming and certain health outcomes.  A review of 22 studies in 1998&lt;ref name="Pruss 1998 1–9"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pruss|first=A|title=Review of epidemiological studies on health effects from exposure to recreational water|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|year=1998|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1093/ije/27.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  confirmed that the health risks for swimmers increased as the number of indicator bacteria increased in recreational waters and that ''E. coli'' and enterococci concentrations correlated best with health outcomes among all the indicators studied.  The relative risk (RR) of illness for swimmers in polluted freshwater versus swimmers in unpolluted water was between 1-2 for the majority of the data sets reviewed.  The same study concluded that bacterial indicators were not well correlated to virus concentrations.&lt;ref name="Pruss 1998 1–9"/&gt;

=== Fate and transport of pathogens ===
Survival of pathogens in waste materials, soil, or water, depends on many environmental factors including temperature, pH, organic matter content, moisture, exposure to light, and the presence of other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guan|first=Tat Yee|author2=R. A. Holley|title=Pathogen Survival in Swine Manure Environments and Transmission of Human Enteric Illness - A Review|journal=Journal of Environmental Quality|year=2003|volume=32|issue=2|pages=383–392|doi=10.2134/jeq2003.0383}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Fecal material can be directly deposited, washed into waters by overland runoff, transported through the ground, or discharged to surface waters via sewer lines, pipes, or drainage tiles. Risk of exposure to humans requires: (1) pathogens to survive and be present; (2) pathogens to recreate in surface waters; and (3) individuals to come in contact with water for sufficient time, or ingest sufficient volumes of water to receive an infectious dose.  Die-off rates of bacteria in the environment are often exponential, therefore, direct deposition of fecal material into waters generally contribute higher concentrations of pathogens than material that must be transported overland or through the subsurface.

=== Human exposure ===
In general, children, the elderly, and [[immunodeficient|immunocompromised]] individuals require a lower dose of a pathogenic organism in order to contract an infection. Presently there are very few studies which are able to quantify the amount of time people are likely to spend in recreational waters and how much water they are likely to ingest.  In general, children swim more often, stay in the water longer, submerge their heads more often, and swallow more water. This makes people more fearful of water in the sea as more bacteria will be growing on and around them.

=== Quantitative microbiological risk assessment ===
[[Quantitative Microbiological Risk Assessment|Quantitative microbiological risk assessments]] (QMRAs) combine pathogen concentrations in water with dose-response relationships and data reflecting potential exposure to estimate the risk of infection.

Data on water exposure are generally collected using questionnaires, but may also be determined from actual measurements of water ingested, or estimated from previously published data.  Respondents are asked to report the frequency and timing and location of exposures, detailed information about the amount of water swallowed and head submersion, and basic demographic characteristics such as age, gender, socioeconomic status and family composition.  Once sufficient data are collected and determined to be representative of the general population, they are usually fit with distributions, and these distribution parameters are then used in the risk assessment equations.  Monitoring data representing occurrence of pathogens, direct measurement of pathogen concentrations, or estimations deriving pathogen concentrations from indicator bacteria concentrations, are also fit with distributions.  Dose is calculated by multiplying the concentration of pathogens per volume by volume.  Dose-responses can also be fit with a distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schets |first1=Franciska M. |first2=Jack F. |last2=Schijven |first3=Ana Maria |last3=de Roda Husman |title=Exposure assessment for swimmers in bathing waters and swimming pools |journal=Water Research |year=2011 |volume=45 |pages=2392–2400 |doi=10.1016/j.watres.2011.01.025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risk management and policy implications ===
The more assumptions that are made, the more uncertain estimates of risk related to pathogens will be.  However, even with considerable uncertainty, QMRAs are a good way to compare different risk scenarios.  In a study comparing estimated health risks from exposures to recreational waters impacted by human and non-human sources of fecal contamination, QMRA determined that the risk of gastrointestinal illness from exposure to waters impacted by cattle were similar to those impacted by human waste, and these were higher than for waters impacted by gull, chicken, or pig faeces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Soller |first=Jeffrey A. |author2=Mary E. Schoen |author3=Timothy Bartrand |author4=John E. Ravenscroft |author5=Nicholas J. Ashbolt |title=Estimated human health risks from exposure to recreational waters impacted by human and non-human sources of faecal contamination |journal=Water Research |year=2010 |volume=44 |pages=4674–4691 | doi = 10.1016/j.watres.2010.06.049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such studies could be useful to risk managers for determining how best to focus their limited resources, however, risk managers must be aware of the limitations of data used in these calculations.  For example, this study used data describing concentrations of ''Salmonella'' in chicken feces published in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kraft |first=D. J. |author2=Carolyn Olechowski-Gerhardt |author3=J. Berkowitz |author4=and M.S. Finstein |title=Salmonella in Wastes Produced at Commercial Poultry Farms |journal=Applied Microbiology |year=1969 |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=703–707}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Methods for quantifying bacteria, changes in animal housing practices and sanitation, and many other factors may have changed the prevalence of ''Salmonella'' since that time.  Also, such an approach often ignores the complicated fate and transport processes that determine bacteria concentrations from the source to the point of exposure.

== Addressing bacterial water quality problems ==
In the US, individual states are allowed to develop their own water quality standards based on EPA’s recommendations under the [[Clean Water Act]] of 1977.  Once water quality standards are approved, states are tasked with monitoring their surface waters to determine where impairments occur, and watershed plans called [[Total Maximum Daily Load]]s (TMDLs) are developed to direct water quality improvement efforts including changes to allowable bacteria loading by [[point source water pollution|point sources]] and recommendations for changes to practices that reduce [[Nonpoint source|nonpoint-source]] contributions to bacteria loads.  Also, many states have beach monitoring programs to warn swimmers when high levels of indicator bacteria are detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.epa.gov/type/oceb/beaches/beaches_index.cfm |title=Beach Monitoring &amp; Notification |author=EPA |website= |accessdate=2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8605">The '''International Sanitary Conferences''' were a series of 14 conferences, the first of them organized by the French Government in 1851 to standardize international quarantine regulations against the spread of cholera, plague, and yellow fever. In total 14 conferences took place from 1851 to 1938; the conferences played a major role in the formation of the [[World Health Organization]] in 1948.

==Background==
The outbreak of the [[Second cholera pandemic (1829–51)|Second cholera pandemic]] in 1829, prompted European Governments to appoint medical missions to investigate the causes of the epidemic. Among others, the [[Académie Nationale de Médecine|Royal Academy of Medicine of Paris]] in June 1831, sent [[Auguste Gérardin]] ([[:fr:Auguste Gérardin|fr]]) and [[Paul Gaimard]] on medical mission to [[Russia]], [[Prussia]], and [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Norman Howard-Jones|1974|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later the [[Minister of Commerce and Industry (France)|Minister of Commerce]] of France, appointed the Secretary of the [[Conseil supérieur de la santé]], [[P. de. Ségur-Dupeyron]] with the task of creating a report on the sanitary regulations
of the [[List of Mediterranean countries|Mediterranean countries]]. The report published in 1834, pointed to the differing quarantine requirements among the countries, and proposed to convene an international conference to standardise quarantine requirements against exotic diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Norman Howard-Jones|1974|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Advertisement for Wilshire's Ionaco.jpg|thumb|An advertisement for the Ionaco.]]
The '''Ionaco''' (often stylized as '''I-on-a-co''' or '''I-ON-A-CO''') was an electric belt developed by [[Gaylord Wilshire]] after his career in politics. It was advertised during the 1920s as a curing device but was dismissed by contemporary medical experts as [[quackery]].&lt;ref name="Holbrook 1959"&gt;{{cite book |last=Holbrook |first=Stewart |date=1959 |chapter=Gaylord Wilshire's I-ON-A-CO |title=The Golden Age of Quackery |publisher=Collier Books |pages=135–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Some historians have offered different theories on Wilshire's decision to work on the Ionaco. Carolyn Thomas de la Peña wrote that it could have been to make up for Wilshire's political failures.&lt;ref name="Technological Fix"/&gt;{{rp|37}} Donald G. Davis noted that Wilshire had severe headaches which doctors in the United States and Europe failed to cure. Davis argued that Wilshire was motivated to enter the medical field to find a cure to his own condition.&lt;ref name=Davis1967/&gt;{{rp|428}}

At the age of 64, Wilshire turned from his work in real estate to focus on the area of public health. He explored radium-infused garments, electric heating pads, and distributed a special kind of health bread called "Ex-cell-o" before working on his electric belt.&lt;ref name="Technological Fix"/&gt;{{rp|36}} This title likely inspired the name for his belt, the "I-on-a-co".&lt;ref name="Technological Fix"/&gt;{{rp|55}} He first recorded his theory for "the radiation cure" in 1924. An early idea for this cure was a magnetic turban for head use.&lt;ref name=Davis1967/&gt;{{rp|429}}

==History==
Wilshire developed the "Life Belt" for 15 years starting in 1910. He tried it on himself in 1925, and it reportedly cured his condition. He started giving the belt to his relatives and friends, who also reported positive results.&lt;ref name=Davis1967/&gt;{{rp|429}} About 50,000 devices were sold between 1925 and 1927.&lt;ref name="Technological Fix"/&gt;{{rp|33}}

Wilshire established the Iona Company with general offices in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=Davis1967/&gt;{{rp|429}}  Agencies for this company spread throughout the Pacific Coast and metropolitan areas of the United States.&lt;ref name=Davis1967/&gt;{{rp|432}}  Sales for the Ionaco reached a peak in the fall of 1926,&lt;ref name=Davis1967/&gt;{{rp|433}} and the company attempted to establish agents in Europe.&lt;ref name=Davis1967/&gt;{{rp|434}} By 1927 the company had 23 regional offices and around 70 demonstrators.&lt;ref name="Technological Fix"/&gt;{{rp|42}}

Several health organizations started to investigate the Ionaco during this time, including the [[Public Health League of Washington]], the [[Better Business Bureau of Seattle]],&lt;ref name=Davis1967/&gt;{{rp|442}} and the [[Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research]].&lt;ref name=Hancock1949/&gt;{{rp|111}}  On 18 November 1926 Wilshire challenged the California medical profession to investigate his device in a full-page advertisement in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref name=Hancock1949/&gt;{{rp|109–111}} Arthur J. Cramp of the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) responded to Wilshire's letter with an article that critically analyzed the claims regarding the Ionaco. This eventually led to a decline in device sales in the summer of 1927.&lt;ref name=Davis1967/&gt;{{rp|442–3}} The Iona Company dissolved following Wilshire's death in 1927, though sellers continued to promote the Ionaco throughout the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name="Pena2005"/&gt;

==Design==
Wilshire's concept for his electric belt and his theory of electromagnetic health was influenced by [[Otto Heinrich Warburg]]'s study of iron in the blood. According to Wilshire, the device's magnetic field was supposed to increase the body's absorption of oxygen to free the body from toxic diseases.&lt;ref name="Technological Fix"/&gt;{{rp|37–38}} The belt was marketed as both a health-improving device and a cure for most diseases; including [[cancer]], [[diabetes]], [[tuberculosis]], [[arthritis]], [[neuritis]], and [[insomnia]].&lt;ref name=Davis1967/&gt;{{rp|435–9}}

The interior had a thick coil of insulated wire that generated a weak magnetic current. It also had a smaller wire coil with a flashlight globe that would light up when placed close to the thick coil.&lt;ref name=Davis1967/&gt;{{rp|431}} The exterior of the belt was covered by a thick layer of leather.&lt;ref name="Technological Fix"/&gt;{{rp|33}} It was roughly {{convert|15|to|18|in|cm}} in diameter, and wide enough to fit over the shoulder of a grown adult.&lt;ref name="Technological Fix"/&gt;{{rp|33}}&lt;ref name=Davis1967/&gt;{{rp|431}} It weighed about {{convert|6.5|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref name="Davis1967"/&gt;{{rp|431}}

==Marketing==
Advertisements for the electric belt relied on testimonials published in newspapers and aired on the radio.&lt;ref name=Davis1967/&gt;{{rp|435–9}} The AMA investigated these claims, some of which were attributed to well-known physicians, and found that many of the quotations had been falsified.&lt;ref name=Hancock1949/&gt;{{rp|109}} Wilshire and his company marketed the electric device to those most likely to use it, including phone subscribers and power plant customers.&lt;ref name="Technological Fix"/&gt;{{rp|50}} Distributors covered certain regions to promote the device by demonstrations and door-to-door sales. In-house sales associates called demonstrators provided both paid and free treatments for potential buyers.&lt;ref name="Technological Fix"/&gt;{{rp|41}}

Each Ionaco belt cost $3.50 ({{Inflation|US|3.50|1926|fmt=eq}}) to manufacture and each belt was sold for $65 ({{Inflation|US|65|1926|fmt=eq}}),&lt;ref name="Technological Fix"/&gt;{{rp|41}} though it could also be purchased on credit for $5 ({{Inflation|US|5|1926|fmt=eq}}) a month.&lt;ref name="Technological Fix"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

==Legacy==
In 1928 Philip Ilsey, the former manager of the Iona Company in Cleveland, started marketing an Ionaco clone called the Theronoid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Van Vleck |first=Richard |url=http://www.americanartifacts.com/smma/thero.htm |title=Theronoid Electromagnetic Solenoid |work=Scientific Medical &amp; Mechanical Antiques |date=1998 |accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar electric belt imitations appeared during this time, and were given names such as the "Ionizer," or the "Restoro".&lt;ref name="Fishbein 1932"/&gt; Such imitations continued to be sold on the market even after promoters stopped marketing the Ionaco in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Pena2005"/&gt;

Contemporary health experts dismissed the Ionaco and its spin-offs as [[quackery]].&lt;ref name="Holbrook 1959"/&gt; In 1932, the physician [[Morris Fishbein]] commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Gaylord Wilshire sold these devices for $55 cash or $65 on time payments, and thousands of them were sold by his methods of promotion. Shortly after the development of the device Wilshire himself died of a disease of the kidney in a New York hospital, no doubt without the benefit of his own invention. He was a remarkable charlatan.&lt;ref name="Fishbein 1932"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fishbein |first=Morris |year=1932 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015029746438;view=2up;seq=170 |title=Fads and Quackery in Healing: An Analysis of the Foibles of the Healing Cults |location=New York |publisher=Covici Friede |pages=153–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Juklavatnet''' is a [[lake]] on the border of the municipalities of [[Kvinnherad]] and [[Jondal]] in [[Hordaland]] county, [[Norway]].  The {{convert|3.61|km2|adj=on}} lake lies just outside [[Folgefonna National Park]] and immediately to the west of the [[Nordre Folgefonna]] [[glacier]].  The only road access comes from the small village of [[Nordrepollen]] in the [[Mauranger]] area of Kvinnherad municipality, about {{convert|10|km}} south of the lake.  There is a [[dam]] on the western end of the lake which regulates the depth of the water so that it can be used for [[hydroelectric power]] generation.  The lake is the largest reservoir that feeds into the Mauranger power station.&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snl.no/Mauranger_kraftverk|title=Mauranger kraftverk|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2014-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Langavatnet''' is a [[lake]] in the municipality of [[Odda]] in [[Hordaland]] county, [[Norway]].  The {{convert|6.19|km2|adj=on}} lake lies about {{convert|10|km}} straight east of the town of [[Odda (town)|Odda]].  The lake has a [[dam]] at the north end to regulate the water level for the purposes of [[hydroelectric power]] generation.  The water of the lake previously flowed north to create the large Ringedalsfossen [[waterfall]] which now only flows when the lake gets too full.  The water flows over the falls into the lake [[Ringedalsvatnet]] (which has a dam at its western end) before flowing through the short river Tysso which empties into the [[Sørfjorden (Hardanger)|Sørfjorden]].&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snl.no/Skjeggedalsfossen|title=Skjeggedalsfossen|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30972">This is a list of [[Hatzolah]] chapters. Hatzolah is an all volunteer [[Emergency medical services]] organization staffed by [[Orthodox Judaism|Jewish Orthodox]] [[Emergency medical technician]]s and [[Paramedic]]s. Locations where chapters are situated are listed alphabetically by geography.

Each neighborhood or city in Hatzalah operates independently.&lt;ref name="Affiliates"&gt;{{cite web |title=Affiliates|url=http://www.hatzalah.org/affiliates.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some exceptions, where there is a tight affiliation with neighboring Hatzolahs, a loose affiliation of neighboring Hatzolahs, or some other basic level of cooperation.

==Israel==
[[File:Ichud Hatzalah scooter.jpg|200px|right|thumb|An [[United Hatzalah|Ichud Hatzalah]] rapid response scooter parked in [[Geula]], [[Jerusalem]].]] Hatzolah in Israel on the national level exists as two different organizations: '''Tzevet Hatzolah''' and '''Ichud Hatzalah''' (rendered in English as '''[[United Hatzalah]]'''). Hatzolah Israel was the original organization under the leadership of David "Duki" Greenwald, in 2006 Ichud Hatzalah was launched as competing organization with Hatzolah Israel, which eventually led Hatzolah Israel to declare bankruptcy. Many Hatzolah Israel volunteers who were dissatisfied with the actions of Ichud Hatzalah's leadership objected to joining the organization and launched their own organization called Tzevet Hatzolah (loosely translated to TEAM Hatzolah).

While Tzevet Hatzolah volunteers provide both emergency first responder care and emergency transport utilizing [[Magen David Adom]] ambulances, Ichud Hatzalah only provides first responder care and rely on [[Magen David Adom]] for emergency transport.
Each of the organizations has many local chapters, and provides coordinated response for larger emergencies or extra coverage across multiple localities.&lt;ref name="Affililates"&gt;{{cite web |title=Links|url=http://www.hatzalah.org/alinks.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitedhatzalah.org/ |title=Home page |accessdate=2008-09-14 |publisher=United Hatzalah of Israel |location=[[Jerusalem]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally there are several smaller Hatzolah organizations which operate on the local level. A partial list can be found below.

==Mexico==
Chevra Hatzalah Mexico was founded in 1997 by Mr. Chaim Silver.  The branch is run by the Syrian-Sephardic community under supervision of Mr. Abraham Levy who is the CEO.  It has 70 full-time volunteers, seven ambulances and six locations (five bases and a headquarters).  It also has access to a helicopter and air transport.  All dispatchers are Volunteer EMS for immediate intervention and instructions, some of them certified in Advanced Critical Care Medicine and Emergency response, actually working for prestigious Mexican Hospitals and National Medical Centers. Volunteers have plenty of experience in Trauma and Internal Medicine emergencies, having training in the Mexican Red Cross´s Ambulance Center. The branch covers the Jewish areas of Tecamachalco, Bosques, Polanco, Interlomas, and the weekend resort city Cuernavaca. It has full-time operating bases in three major Jewish areas, having its Central Base in Tecamachalco, a dense populated Jewish area in Mexico City.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hatzalah.com.mx/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florida===
Since January 2010, Miami-Dade has a chapter that provides [[Basic life support]] response and relies on [[Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department]], and [[Miami Beach Fire Rescue Department]] for [[Advanced life support]] [[paramedic]] care and transport.
*[[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami]]  Covers areas of unincorporated North East [[Miami-Dade County]], as well as select portions of the city of [[North Miami Beach]], the city of [[Aventura, Florida|Aventura]], the city of [[Surfside, Florida|Surfside]], [[Bal Harbour, Florida|Bal Harbour]], [[Bay Harbor, Florida|Bay Harbor]], and central [[Miami Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://miamihatzalah.com/ | title=Hatzalah of Miami-Dade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illinois===
Hatzalah Chicago started by providing first responder coverage for Lincolnwood, Peterson Park, Skokie, and West Rogers Park.&lt;ref name="ChicagoFAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hatzalahchicago.org/ |title=Hatzalah of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Chicago]]&lt;ref name="ChicagoFAQ"/&gt;

Hatzalah of Chicago purchased 2 ambulances and they now transport. 

As of January 2018 Hatzalah Chicago purchased a third ambulance and started providing Advanced Life Support (ALS) service to the Chicago community.

===Maryland===
Baltimore started a Hatzalah in 2007 as a first-responder-only service with transport to be done by Baltimore City ambulance units. Currently, Hatzalah of Baltimore does maintain a fleet of four ambulances, and provides Advanced Life Support (ALS) services to the Northwest Baltimore community provided it is in their response area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hatzalahbaltimore.org/ |title=Hatzalah of Baltimore: When Every Second Counts |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68E7kgLXN?url=http://www.hatzalahbaltimore.org/ |archivedate=2012-06-06 |accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Jersey===
New Jersey has many Hatzolah organizations throughout the State. Each NJ affiliate maintains its own emergency phone number, dispatchers, and radio frequencies. While they are not officially connected, as with NYC Hatzolah, many of them are nevertheless loosely affiliated, sharing classes or working at each other's events.  On occasion, all six state divisions have worked together to provide joint event coverage or to share training classes.

Per New Jersey law, volunteers with proper permits may equip their cars with blue flashing lights and electronic airhorns, but not red flashing lights, nor sirens. Coordinators' ("officers'") personal vehicles, and any vehicle owned by a squad with a 'No Fee' license plate, are permitted the use of red flashing lights and sirens; not all branches make use of these allowances. Paramedic (ALS) units in New Jersey are only run by hospitals, per state law. The limitation to BLS is not just for Hatzolah and other volunteer agencies: all New Jersey "911" municipal-run EMS services are also limited to BLS. However, see '''Lakewood''' below for a special exception.

*'''Jersey Shore'''  This chapter covers the areas of Deal, West Deal, Long Branch, Eatontown, Alenhurst, Ocean Township, and additional Jersey Shore communities during warmer months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hatzalahems.com/ |title=Jersey Shore Hatzalah |publisher=Chevra Hatzalah of The Jersey Shore |location=[[Long Branch, New Jersey]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the only Sephardic-run Hatzalah in the United States. (Mexico City, Mexico also has a Sephardic Hatzalah.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hatzalahems.com/ |title=Home page |accessdate=2008-09-14 |publisher=Chevra Hatzalah Jersey Shore |location=[[Elberon, New Jersey]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Elizabeth/Hillside'''
Hatzalah of Union County, with "U-prefix" unit numbers. Union County is geographically and organizationally separate from Union City. With three active ambulances, "the U" also responds to nearby towns including Linden, Union Township, Roselle and Roselle Park, and even to businesses in Newark where slow EMS response may allow the Hatzalah ambulance to complete the 12-14 minute trip from Elizabeth or Hillside before a Newark city crew arrives. In early 2014, efforts were started to have "in-house" responders answer calls within the confines of the City of Newark but this service has yet to go "live".  Hatzalah of Union County also covers the Jersey Gardens Mall, Newark Liberty Airport, and nearby stretches of the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway. Two ambulances are located in the greater Elizabeth/Hillside area and the third is located in Roselle.

*'''Edison/Highland Park'''
Hatzolah of Middlesex County http://www.hatzolahmc.org/,  with "MC-prefix" unit numbers. Middlesex County is a county located in North-Central New Jersey.  It launched on November 16, 2014.  At this time, their primary areas of response are Edison (including Raritan Center), Highland Park, Piscataway, and portions of East Brunswick.  For events in various hotels, they have responded to Somerset as well.

*'''Lakewood'''
The largest branch in New Jersey, with "L-prefix" unit numbers. Unique to New Jersey, Lakewood has a Paramedic (ALS) unit. The ALS unit is owned and run by [[MONOC]], but the Paramedics are also Lakewood Hatzolah members, and the ambulance was donated by Hatzolah Lakewood to MONOC. This unusual arrangement meets New Jersey's strict hospital-based ALS rules, while giving Hatzolah its own ALS coverage. Also unique, Lakewood has its own Rescue (extrication) unit.
*[[Lakewood Township, New Jersey|Lakewood Township]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lakewoodhatzalah.org/default.aspx |title=Unofficial Home page |accessdate=2008-09-14 |publisher=Chevra Hatzalah of Lakewood |location=[[Lakewood Township, New Jersey]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Newark''' 
Hatzalah of Newark EMS http://hatzalahofnewark.org/ with the "N-prefix" unit numbers went live in 2015 and provides BLS service to the Newark community and surrounding areas including [[Newark Liberty International Airport]]. ALS services when needed are dispatched by the local hospital.
*'''Passaic/Clifton''' 
Hatzolah of Passaic/Clifton EMS. The neighboring cities have a contiguous Orthodox Jewish community, with most of the community and its institutions on the Passaic side. Likewise, Hatzolah of Passaic/Clifton, with "P-prefix" unit numbers, covers both parts of the community, but is primarily based in Passaic, with some members and management in Clifton. This Hatzolah is geographically near Union City, and can provide extra coverage for them. Hatzolah of Passaic/Clifton has 30 active members, 20 dispatchers,  two active ambulances and a third on standby, for a community of about 2,000 households.

*'''Union City'''
Hatzolah of Union City http://www.hatzolahuc.com/, is run out of Mosded Sanz-Zviel, which is the center of the Chasidic community in Union City. It is the only Chasidic Hatzolah in New Jersey. Union City is located in Hudson County, and is not related to Union County. Union City uses VHF radios, while all other New Jersey chapters use UHF radios.

===New York===
'''Canarsie/Mill Basin'''&lt;br&gt;
The Canarsie/Mill Basin chapter was originally just the Canarsie division. As the Canarsie Orthodox neighborhood declined, and the Mill Basin one grew, Canarsie started taking more calls and members from nearby Mill Basin, and is now primarily a Mill Basin operation. Canarsie/Mill Basin also covers nearby Georgetown. There are parts of the Brooklyn neighborhood of Mill Basin that border Madison/Midwood/East Midwood, so there is some overlap in coverage with Flatbush.

'''[[Catskill Mountains]]'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chvac.net/ |title=Home page |accessdate=2008-09-14 |date=2008-07-21 |publisher=Catskills Hatzalah}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This chapter is part of Central Hatzalah of New York City. While the Catskills have a year-round operation, the vast majority of their activity is in July and August, when summer residents arrive.

'''[[Monroe, NY]]'''&lt;br&gt;
The Chasidic community in Kiryas Joel (Monroe), NY has a chapter. Uniquely, it operates separately from all other New York State Hatzolah organizations.

'''New Square'''&lt;br&gt;
This chapter is a breakoff from the Rockland Hatzoloh chapter. Uniquely, the chapter has female Certified First Responders who respond to calls involving [[obstetrics]] related emergencies.

[[File:USA,NewYork,LowerEastSideHatzalah.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A Lower East Side Hatzalah ambulance, New York.]]
This chapter has sixteen local divisions which share rabbinic counsel, [[Radio frequency|radio frequencies]], central dispatch and lobbying, but have separate fundraising and management.&lt;ref name="Madrich"&gt;{{cite book |title=Madrich L'Chevra Hatzalah |last=Handler |first=Mechel |author2=Rabbi Dovid Weinberger  |publisher=Feldheim}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Catskills, the Five Towns, and Yonkers are the only areas outside of New York City covered by NYC chapters.
The chapter has a central dispatching network with teams of 2 volunteer dispatchers working in tandem. Each dispatch team works several hours on a shift.  The chapter also uses a mobile command center for dealing with large events.

===Pennsylvania===
Philadelphia's Hatzolah has limited service, providing first responder aid only in the Northeast area. Hatzolah of Philadelphia transports are provided by calling in either Patriot Ambulance, or, when the situation warrants, 9-1-1. Patriot Ambulance is a local paid ambulance service owned by a community member. Its owner has also provided Philadelphia Hatzolah with financial assistance, training, and medical guidance to ensure excellence and continuity in patient care. Philadelphia has nine responders, all state certified. Some members are full-time professional EMTs or Paramedics.&lt;ref name="PhillyArticle"&gt;{{cite web

The '''March for Women's Lives''' was a demonstration held on April 25, 2004 on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] protesting the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] and other restrictions on [[abortion]].

==Events and participants==
{{moresources|section|date=April 2017}}
A rally on the Mall began at 10 a.m., and was followed by a march through downtown Washington, with a route along [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]]. Celebrities who appeared at the march included [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], [[Indigo Girls]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Ashley Judd]], [[Kathleen Turner]], [[Ted Turner]], [[Ana Gasteyer]], [[Janeane Garofalo]], [[Bonnie Franklin]], [[Julianne Moore]] and former Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]]; also appearing were veteran abortion rights leaders, such as [[Kate Michelman]] of [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] and [[Gloria Steinem]], and many members of Congress.

==Aftermath==
[[George W. Bush]] went on to win a second term, and the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act was not repealed. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] upheld the law in its 2007 [[Gonzales v. Carhart]] decision.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

[[Alcoholism]] is a chronic disease characterized by trouble controlling the consumption of alcohol, [[Alcohol dependence|dependence]] (needing to consume more to achieve the same effects), and [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome|withdrawal]] upon rapid cessation of drinking.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo Clinic Staff. (2014, December). Alcoholism. Available at http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcoholism/basics/definition/con-20020866&lt;/ref&gt; According to ARDI reports approximately 88,000 people had alcohol-related deaths in the United States between the years of 2006 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2013). Alcohol and Public Health: Alcohol Related Disease Impact (ARDI). Available athttp://nccd.cdc.gov/DPH_ARDI/Default.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, chronic alcohol use is consistently the third leading cause of death in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2014, November). Alcohol and Public Health: Data, Trends, and Maps. Available at https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/data-stats.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In consequence, research has sought to determine the factors responsible for the development and persistence of alcoholism. From this research, several molecular and epigenetic mechanisms have been discovered.

== Background ==
Alcoholism is characterized by a wide range of symptoms including compulsive alcohol seeking and consumption, [[Alcohol tolerance|tolerance]] (resistance to the effects of alcohol after repeated consumption), and withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, profuse sweating, and uncontrollable shaking upon rapid cessation of drinking.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo Clinic Staff. (2014, December). Alcoholism: Symptoms. Available at http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcoholism/basics/symptoms/con-20020866&lt;/ref&gt; There is not a specific test for diagnosing alcoholism; however, patient questionnaires and medical screenings for ailments typically associated with alcoholism, such as cirrhosis, heart problems, and pancreatitis, are often used as diagnostic tools.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo Clinic Staff. (2014, December). Alcoholism: Tests and Diagnosis. Available at http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcoholism/basics/tests-diagnosis/con-20020866&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kahan M (April 1996). "Identifying and managing problem drinkers". Can Fam Physician 42,  661–71&lt;/ref&gt; Several factors influence the development of alcoholism including genetic predisposition and environmental stressors such as grief, stress, depression, and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, M. (2010). Alcohol Use and Abuse. In Alcoholism (p. 14). Santa Barbara, Calif.: Greenwood Press/ABC-CLIO.&lt;/ref&gt; In coordination with these factors, molecular and epigenetic mechanisms influence the progression toward alcoholism.

== Mechanisms ==

An increased propensity for alcoholism has been associated with stress-related anxiety and [[dysphoria]], a state of general unease or dissatisfaction. The experience of various types of stress, including severe acute stress and chronic stress, can lead to the onset of dysphoria. Ethanol consumption promotes the release of [[dopamine]] into the [[nucleus accumbens]] (NAc) which is translated as a “reward".&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;Bolanos, C. A. and Nestler, E. J. (2004). Neurotrophic mechanisms in drug addiction. Neuromolecular Medicine, 5(1), 69-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, to cope with negative emotions, individuals often turn to alcohol as a form of temporary self-medication.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, J.M., Robinson, J., Sareen, J. (2009). Self-medication of mood disorders with alcohol and drugs in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Journal of Affective Disorders, 115(3), 367–375.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, repeated ethanol use results in diminishing returns which prompts increased intake and dependence.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; Research has and continues to investigate the molecular and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the downward spiral of alcoholism.

===Molecular Mechanisms===

====Receptors====

Several receptors directly interact with ethanol to promote a cascade of signaling. N-methyl-D-aspartate ([[NMDA receptor|NMDA]]) receptors are glutamate receptors particularly important in [[long-term potentiation]] in neurons. These receptors have been linked to ethanol use. Acute ethanol exposure, a brief period of ethanol use, inhibits Ca2+ flow through NMDA receptors in the [[hippocampus]], the brain structure particularly important in memory formation.&lt;ref&gt;Lovinger, D.M., White, G., Weight, F.F. (1989). Ethanol inhibits NMDA-activated ion current in hippocampal neurons. Science, 243, 1721–1724.&lt;/ref&gt; A specific subunit of NMDA receptors, NR2B, shows particularly high sensitivity to ethanol as exemplified by increased NR2B expression in response to ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;Smothers, C.T., Clayton, R., Blevins, T., Woodward, J.J.

The NR2B subtype of NMDA receptor: a potential target for the treatment of alcohol dependence.

Potential role of cAMP response element-binding protein in ethanol-induced N-methylD-aspartate receptor 2B subunit gene transcription in fetal mouse cortical cells. Mol Pharmacol, 67, 2126–2136.&lt;/ref&gt; Another family of receptors, metabotropic glutamate receptors ([[Metabotropic glutamate receptor|mGluR]]), may also contribute by activating MAPK pathways and increasing intracellular Ca2+. Antagonism of mGluR5 showed a decrease in ethanol consumption suggesting mGluR5’s role in alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;Gass, J.T. and Olive, M.F.

(2005) The mGluR5 antagonist MPEP decreases operant ethanol self-administration during maintenance and after repeated alcohol deprivations in alcohol-preferring (P) rats.

(2005) Effects of a metabotropic, mGlu5, glutamate receptor antagonist on ethanol consumption by genetic drinking rats.

(2006) The mGluR5 antagonist MPEP selectively inhibits the onset and maintenance of ethanol self-administration in C57BL/6J mice. Psychopharmacology (Berl) 183:429–438.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, voltage-gated calcium channels ([[Voltage-dependent calcium channel|VGCCs]]) were shown to be inhibited by ethanol resulting in reduced influx of Ca2+.&lt;ref&gt;Mullikin-Kilpatrick, D., Mehta, N.D., Hildebrandt, J.D., Treistman, S.N. (1995) Gi is involved in ethanol inhibition of L-type calcium channels in undifferentiated but not differentiated PC-12 cells. Mol Pharmacol, 47, 997–1005.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, repeated ethanol intake, or chronic ethanol use, increases expression of the slow-inactivating L-type VGCCs known to sustain Ca2+ influx.&lt;ref&gt;Katsura, M., Shibasaki, M., Hayashida, S., Torigoe, F., Tsujimura, A., Ohkuma, S.

(2000) Ethanol regulates calcium channel subunits by protein kinase C d-dependent and -independent mechanisms. J Biol Chem, 275, 25717–25722.&lt;/ref&gt; When these channels are inhibited with an antagonist, ethanol consumption is reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Gardell, L.R., Reid, L.D., Boedeker, K.L., Liakos, T.M., Hubbell, C.L. (1997) Isradipine and naltrexone in combination with isradipine interact with a period of abstinence to reduce rats’ intakes of an alcoholic beverage.

Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry, 14, 623–631.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Beun, R., Schneider, R., Klein, A., Lohmann, A., De Vry, J. (1996) Effects of nimodipine and other calcium channel antagonists in alcohol-preferring AA rats. Alcohol, 13, 263–271.&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[Adenylate cyclase|Adenylyl Cyclase]]====

Adenylyl cyclase ([[Adenylate cyclase|AC]]) plays a role in ethanol induced signaling pathways. Acute ethanol may increase AC activity resulting in increased levels of [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] and altered activity of cAMP targets.&lt;ref&gt;Hatta, S., Saito, T., Ohshika, H. (1994) Effects of ethanol on the function of G proteins in rat cerebral cortex membranes. Alcohol Alcohol Suppl, 29, 45–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the cAMP targets, protein kinase A (PKA) has been associated with ethanol use. While acute ethanol use increases the activity of AC, chronic use tends to desensitize AC such that more simulation, increased ethanol consumption, is required to elicit the same response.&lt;ref&gt;Mochly-Rosen, D., Chang, F.H., Cheever, L., Kim, M., Diamond, I., Gordon, A.S. (1988) Chronic ethanol causes heterologous desensitization of receptors by reducing as messenger RNA. Nature, 333, 848–850&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tabakoff, B., Whelan, J.P., Ovchinnikova, L., Nhamburo, P., Yoshimura, M., Hoffman, P.L. (1995) Quantitative changes in G proteins do not mediate ethanol-induced downregulation of adenylyl cyclase in mouse cerebral cortex. Alcohol Clin Exp Res, 19, 187–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kinases====

Ethanol transduction pathways involve several protein kinases known to phosphorylate substrates linked to alcoholism, namely cAMP response element-binding protein ([[CREB]]). CREB plays a central role in ethanol responses making its activation an important step in the pathway. Some of the kinase families currently linked to alcoholism are Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs), protein kinase A (PKA), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).&lt;ref name="twenty-seven"&gt;Constantinescu, A., Diamond, I., Gordon, A.S. (1999). Ethanolinduced translocation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase to the nucleus. Mechanism and functional consequences. J Biol Chem, 274, 26985–26991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ron, D., Jurd, R.

''[[Ann N Y Acad Sci]]'', 1141, 22–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

;'''''[[CAMK|CamK]]'''''

:Rapid changes in Ca2+ concentration, influenced by receptors such as those described above, regulate the activity of CaMKs. Withdrawal following chronic ethanol use as well as voluntary ethanol intake, consuming ethanol when both an ethanol solution and water are offered, in rats showed a decrease in CaMKIV and consequently p-CREB.&lt;ref name="thirty"&gt;Pandey, S.C., Roy, A., Zhang, H. (2003). The decreased phosphorylation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding (CREB) protein in the central amygdala acts as a molecular substrate for anxiety related to ethanol withdrawal in rats.

Chronic ethanol intake-induced changes in open-field behavior and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV expression in nucleus accumbens of rats: naloxone reversal. ''Acta Pharmacol Sin'', 29, 646–652.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ethanol activates CaMKII resulting in phosphorylation of CaMKII targets such as BK potassium channels.&lt;ref name="thirty-four"&gt;Mahadev, K., Chetty, C.S., Vemuri, M.C. (2001). Effect of prenatal and postnatal ethanol exposure on Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in rat cerebral cortex.

CaM kinase II phosphorylation of slo Thr107 regulates activity and ethanol responses of BK channels. ''[[Nat Neurosci]]'', 9, 41–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

;'''''[[Protein kinase A|PKA]]'''''

:As discussed above, cAMP levels rise following ethanol-induced activation of AC.  This rise in cAMP activates PKA. In response to acute ethanol exposure, activated PKA is transported to the nucleus where it phosphorylates CREB.&lt;ref name="twenty-seven" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thirty-six"&gt;Dohrman, D.P., Diamond, I., Gordon, A.S. (1996). Ethanol causes translocation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit to the nucleus. ''[[Proc Natl Acad Sci USA]]'', 93, 10217–10221.&lt;/ref&gt; While chronic ethanol use has not been shown to affect the levels of the catalytic domain PKA-Cα, voluntary ethanol intake does increase PKA-Cα in the central nucleus of the amygdala ([[Central nucleus of the amygdala|CeA]]) and medial nucleus of the amygdala (MeA) in P rats.&lt;ref name="thirty" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thirty-one" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thirty-seven"&gt;Pandey, S.C., Zhang, H., Roy, A., Xu, T. (2005). Deficits in amygdaloid cAMP-responsive element-binding protein signaling play a role in genetic predisposition to anxiety and alcoholism. ''[[J Clin Invest]]'', 115, 2762–2773.&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in PKA levels following acute ethanol use may induce negative feedback mechanisms to reduce PKA activity. Chronic ethanol exposure has been shown to reduce PKA activity in the [[nucleus accumbens]] and the amygdala due to increased levels of PKA inhibitor α.&lt;ref name="thirty-eight"&gt;Lai, C.C., Kuo, T.I., Lin, H.H. (2007). The role of protein kinase A in acute ethanol-induced neurobehavioral actions in rats. ''[[Anesth Analg]]'', 105, 89–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

;'''''[[Mitogen-activated protein kinase|MAPK]]'''''

:MAPK proteins, especially [[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|Erk1/2]], have been linked to ethanol use. While there is not a consensus, acute and chronic ethanol exposure may increase p-Erk1/2 levels in the CeA and MeA of rats.&lt;ref name="thirty-nine"&gt;Pandey, S.C., Zhang, H., Ugale, R. et al. (2008). Effector immediate-early gene Arc in the amygdala plays a critical role in alcoholism.

Ethanol enhances growth factor activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases by a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 92, 1891–1895.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ku, B.M., Lee, Y.K., Jeong, J.Y., Mun, J., Han, J.Y., Roh, G.S., et al. (2007). Ethanol-induced oxidative stress is mediated by p38 MAPK pathway in mouse hippocampal cells. Neurosci Lett., 419, 64–7.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a decrease in Erk1/2 is observed during withdrawal.&lt;ref name="thirty-nine" /&gt; These patterns are mirrored in Erk1/2’s downstream target CREB and serve as a link between ethanol exposure and CREB. Erk1/2 is activated in the CeA and ventral tegmental area ([[Ventral tegmental area|VTA]]) by [[BDNF]], a downstream target of CREB, which was shown to decrease ethanol consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Carnicella, S., Kharazia, V., Jeanblanc, J., Janak, P.H., Ron, D. (2008). GDNF is a fast-acting potent inhibitor of alcohol consumption and relapse. ''Proc Natl Acad Sci USA'', 105, 8114–8119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forty-three"&gt;Pandey, S.C., Zhang, H., Roy, A., Misra, K. (2006). Central and medial amygdaloid brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling plays a critical role in alcohol-drinking and anxiety-like behaviors. ''Journal of Neuroscience'', 26(32), 8320–8331.&lt;/ref&gt; This likely serves as a negative-feedback mechanism to prevent excessive ethanol use.

====[[CREB]]====

CREB may play a significant role in alcohol addiction. CREB is a transcription factor known to influence CNS functioning. This protein is activated by phosphorylation via the kinase families CaMK, PKA, and MAPK.&lt;ref name="forty-four"&gt;Koob, G.F., Sanna, P.P., Bloom, F.E. (1998). Neuroscience of addiction.

Ethanol-BDNF interactions: still more questions than answers. Pharmacol Ther, 118, 36–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Levels of CREB and p-CREB (a highly phosphorylated CREB protein) play a dynamic role in the preference for, consumption of, and dependence on ethanol. When comparing alcohol-preferring (P) to –nonpreferring (NP) rats, lower levels of CREB, p-CREB, and CRE-DNA binding activity were observed in the CeA and MeA of P rats.&lt;ref name="thirty-seven" /&gt; In conjunction, anxiety and ethanol consumption was higher in P rats. Acute ethanol exposure increases CREB and p-CREB and decreased anxiety in only P rats.&lt;ref name="thirty-seven" /&gt;&lt;ref name="forty-five" /&gt; Activation of PKA in the CeA increases levels of p-CREB while decreasing anxiety and ethanol consumption in P rats. The opposite occurs in NP rats when exposed to PKA inhibitor.&lt;ref name="thirty-seven" /&gt; When rats are withdrawn from ethanol after chronic exposure they showed decreased levels of p-CREB, but not total CREB, in the CeA and MeA which manifests in anxiety-like behaviors.&lt;ref name="thirty" /&gt; Furthermore, acute ethanol use increases while chronic exposure stabilizes p-CREB levels in rat cerebellum and striatum.&lt;ref name="fifty-two"&gt;Yang, X., Horn, K., Wand, G.S. (1998). Chronic ethanol exposure impairs phosphorylation of CREB and CRE-binding activity in rat striatum.

(1999). Potential role of the gene transcription factor cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein in ethanol withdrawal-related anxiety. J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 288, 866–878.&lt;/ref&gt;

====CREB Targets====

The effects of ethanol on CREB are further manifested in CREB-target genes, namely BDNF, TrkB, Arc, NPY, and CRF.

;'''''[[Brain-derived neurotrophic factor|BDNF]]'''''

(2001). Neurotrophins as synaptic modulators. Nat Rev Neurosci, 2, 24–32 102.&lt;/ref&gt; As described previously, MAPK pathways activate CREB. Thus, a feed-forward mechanism leads to the ramping up of p-CREB, BDNF, and TrkB levels which leads to the creation of new set-point, higher stimulus requirements to elicit a response, and may contribute to the downward spiral of alcoholism.

Taken together, ethanol consumption influences a wide array of molecules. Many of these are involved in feed-forward mechanisms which further promote alcohol relapse and dependence.

===Epigenetic Mechanisms===

In coordination with the molecules and pathways discussed, epigenetic mechanisms play a role in the development of alcoholism. These mechanisms include [[DNA methylation]], [[Histone acetylation and deacetylation|histone acetylation]] and [[Histone methylation|methylation]], and ([[MicroRNA|microRNA miRNA]]) action. Methylation of the DNA typically occurs at [[CpG site]]s, or a cysteine nucleotide followed by a guanine nucleotide in the 5’ to 3’ direction. These sites are common promoter and regulatory elements in mammals and methylation of cysteine residues typically inhibits these functions resulting in the repression of gene expression. DNA methylation is carried out by DNA methyltransferases ([[DNA methyltransferase|DNMTs]]) which are recruited to CpG sites by methyl-DNA binding proteins, such as [[MECP2|MeCP2]]. Next, histones can be modified in several ways to increase or decrease gene expression. [[Histone]]s are protein complexes used to package DNA into structures known as [[nucleosome]]s. The level of coiling of the DNA around histones is variable and influences transcription levels. Tight coiling, or [[heterochromatin]], is associated with low gene expression or even silencing. Loose coiling, or [[euchromatin]], is associated with higher levels of gene expression. Typically, acetylation of histones is associated with euchromatin formation. Acetyl groups are added by histone acetyltransferases ([[Histone acetyltransferase|HATs]]), such as CBP. In opposition, histone deacetylases ([[Histone deacetylase|HDACs]]) remove acetyl groups, typically leading to the formation of heterochromatin. HDACs are recruited by [[Scaffold protein|scaffolding proteins]], such as RACK 1. HDAC inhibitors prevent HDAC functioning which promotes gene expression. Histone methylation, adding a methyl group to specific histone protein amino acids, can both increase or decrease gene expression depending on the histone protein, amino acid, and number of methyl groups used. Gene expression can also be inhibited post-transcriptionally by miRNA, double-stranded RNA, typically formed from hairpin structures, that is used to inhibit translation of proteins. After processing by the RNA interference ([[RNA interference|RNAi]]) molecules [[Drosha]] and [[Dicer]], a single, guide-strand is loaded into the RNA induced silencing complex ([[RNA-induced silencing complex|RISC]]) which is used to bind mRNA. This binding suppresses protein synthesis and sometimes initiates mRNA degradation.

The epigenetic link to several ethanol related molecules has been established. As discussed before, acute ethanol exposure tends to increase CREB and p-CREB levels while withdrawal after chronic ethanol use is associated with decreased CREB and p-CREB. Also, CREB recruits the CBP, a HAT. Increased CREB and CBP activity at the BDNF promoter have been associated with decreased H3 methylation and increased H3 acetylation at lysine 9.&lt;ref name="eighty-five"&gt;Starkman, B. G., Sakharkar, A. J., &amp; Pandey, S. C. (2012). Epigenetics—Beyond the Genome in Alcoholism. Alcohol Research : Current Reviews, 34(3), 293–305.&lt;/ref&gt; In concordance, histone acetylation, particularly at the BDNF promoter II, increases BDNF expression.&lt;ref name="eighty-six"&gt;Kumar, A., Choi, K.H., Renthal, W., et al. (2005). Chromatin remodeling is a key mechanism underlying cocaine-induced plasticity in striatum. Neuron, 48(2), 303–314.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, BDNF exon IV expression following depolarization is increased and is associated with increased histone acetylation, reduced DNA methylation and reduced MeCP2 binding at the BDNF promoter.&lt;ref name="eighty-seven"&gt;Moonat, S., &amp; Pandey, S. C. (2012). Stress, Epigenetics, and Alcoholism. Alcohol Research : Current Reviews, 34(4), 495–505.&lt;/ref&gt; These changes would tend to increase BDNF expression during acute ethanol exposure. Conversely, since CREB levels and subsequent CBP recruitment fall during withdrawal, these types of epigenetic changes would likely reverse upon withdrawal after chronic ethanol use. In particular, lack of CBP likely results in decreased acetylation of the BDNF promoter. Another layer of regulation modulates the activity of MeCP2 via the protein RACK1. RACK1 at H3 and H4 inhibits MeCP2 binding and promotes histone acetylation; thus, resulting in increased BDNF expression.&lt;ref name="eighty-eight"&gt;He, D.Y., Neasta, J., Ron, D. (2010). Epigenetic regulation of BDNF expression via the scaffolding protein RACK1. Journal of Biological Chemistry, 285(25), 19043–19050.&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic stress, often linked with a propensity to alcoholism, increases H3 methylation near BDNF promoters which inhibits transcription. To oppose this process, antidepressants have been shown to reduce histone methylation, increase H3 acetylation at the BDNF promoter, and reduce levels of HDAC5.&lt;ref name="eighty-seven" /&gt; Recall that HDACs remove acetyl groups and are associated with heterochromatin formation. NR2B is also influenced by epigenetic mechanisms. Recall that this NDMA receptor subunit shows increased expression after ethanol exposure. Decreased CpG methylation of the NR2B gene is associated with chronic, but not acute, ethanol exposure.&lt;ref name="eighty-nine"&gt;Marutha Ravindran, C.R. and Ticku, M.K. (2005). Role of CpG islands in the up-regulation of NMDA receptor NR2B gene expression following chronic ethanol treatment of cultured cortical neurons of mice. Neurochem Int, 46, 313–327&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the increase in NR2B expression in chronic ethanol exposed rats may be mediated by a more open chromatin structure. BK potassium channels are another target: miRNA-9 has been shown to target BK channel transcripts and may influence ethanol tolerance. This will be discussed in more detail in the tolerance section.

Finally, a link has been found between ethanol use and histone acetylation during development. After ethanol exposure, adolescent rats showed increased H3 and H4 acetylation in reward centers of the brain, such as the frontal cortex and nucleus accumbens.&lt;ref name="ninty"&gt;Pascual, M., Boix, J., Felipo, V., Guerri, C. (2009). Repeated alcohol administration during adolescence causes changes in the mesolimbic dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems and promotes alcohol intake in the adult rat. J. Neurochem. 108, 920–931.&lt;/ref&gt; This effect was not seen in adult rats. Thus, brain chromatin remodeling that increases gene expression in reward centers of developing brains may contribute to an increased propensity toward alcoholism upon and after ethanol exposure.

== Tolerance ==

[[Alcohol tolerance|Tolerance]] is a lessened response to ethanol after repeated or prolonged ethanol exposure or consumption. In mammals, tolerance can form within minutes or over longer periods of time.&lt;ref name="ninety-one"&gt;Pietrzykowski, A. Z., &amp; Treistman, S. N. (2008, Winter). The molecular basis of Tolerance. Alcohol Research &amp; Health, 31(4), 298&lt;/ref&gt; Ghezzi et al. (2014) speculated that tolerance occurs due to a [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] mechanism that resists environmental changes. However, homeostatis does not explain how tolerance influences alcohol addiction in many cases. Epigenetic alterations, including [[phosphorylation]], methylation, acetylation, miRNA, and chromatin remodeling, may help explain the cases not explained by homeostatic mechanisms.

These epigenetic mechanisms have been studied in rodents. Acute tolerance was shown to be controlled by changes in the BK channel's phosphorylation state.&lt;ref name="ninety-one" /&gt; Acute tolerance is defined as ethanol tolerance that appears ''during'' an ethanol experience. Phosphorylation of BK channels by PKA is needed for ethanol potentiation of the channel.&lt;ref name="ninety-two"&gt;Ghezzi, A., Y. Al-Hasan, L. Larios, R. Bohm, and N. Atkinson. (2004). Slo K Channel Gene Regulation Mediates Rapid Drug Tolerance. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: 17276-7281.&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol can change the phosphorylation patterns to characterize alcohol-tolerant BK channels.&lt;ref name="ninety-three"&gt;Pietrzykowski, Andrzej Z., Ryan M. Friesen, Gilles E. Martin, Sylvie I. Puig, Cheryl L. Nowak, Patricia M. Wynne, Hava T. Siegelmann, and Steven N. Treistman. (2008). Posttranscriptional Regulation of BK Channel Splice Variant Stability by miR-9 Underlies Neuroadaptation to Alcohol. Neuron, 274-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, in rat magnocellular neurons it was shown that miRNA contributes to rapid and chronic ethanol tolerance by altering the expression of many proteins.&lt;ref name="ninety-one" /&gt; Rapid tolerance is defined as tolerance produced ''following'' a single ethanol exposure. Chronic tolerance is tolerance resulting from repeated exposure. Ethanol exposure upregulates miR-9, a miRNA that binds to some BK channel mRNA transcripts in their 3'-UTR. The binding of miR-9 causes the degradation of the mRNA. The BK channel mRNAs targeted by mir-9 are those that contain an alternatively-spliced exon that has been called ALCOREX. mRNAs that contain this exon produce BK channels that respond strongly to ethanol (high potentiation channels). On the other hand, BK channel mRNA that contains the alternative exon that has been named STREX is used to produce channels that are relatively ethanol insensitive (low potentiation channels). MiR-9 specifically degrades the transcripts encoding high [[Long-term potentiation|potentiation]]channels, leaving behind mostly alcohol-resistant channels.&lt;ref name="ninety-three" /&gt; The reason this mechanism is not used for acute tolerance is because tolerance depends on the modified protein synthesis, which takes time.

The effect histone acetylation on BK channel expression and alcohol tolerance has been studied by Ghezzi et al. (2014) using the [[Drosophila]]. The Drosophila gene that encodes BK channels is called ''slowpoke'' (''slo'').  After ethanol sedation of the flies occurs, acetyl groups are added to histones within the ''slo'' promoter region. Acetylation exposes the ''slo'' promoter to CREB, which enhances slo protein expression. When the flies are exposed to alcohol again, it takes a shorter period of time to recover from sedation and net neural excitability is enhanced. This shows that a tolerance has been built due to increased ''slo'' product. This can also be accomplished by histone deacetylase inhibition that also causes increased ''slo'' gene expression. If the ethanol does not sedate the flies, or ''slo'' expression is not induced, tolerance does not occur.&lt;ref name="ninety-two" /&gt;

The effect the ''slo'' gene has on tolerance appears to differ between species. For example, when ''slo'' expression increases in [[Caenorhabditis elegans|''C. elegans'']], the worms become more sensitive to ethanol as opposed to in Drosophilia where a tolerance is built. While the response to increased ''slo'' expression differs, the ''slo'' gene is involved with tolerance in every species.&lt;ref name="ninety-two" /&gt;

Whether or not tolerance and alcoholism are related is still under debate. Further work must be done in order to find a connection. The closest link between the two is that miRNA is able to regulate expression of multiple genes, and alcoholism is influenced by multiple genes.&lt;ref name="ninety-four"&gt;Pietrzykowski, A., R. Miranda, Y. Tang, P. Sathyan, D. Mayfield, A. Keshavarzian, W. Sampson, and D. Hereld.(2010). MicroRNAs: Master Regulators of Ethanol Abuse and Toxicity? Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, 575-587.&lt;/ref&gt; If a relationship is found, studying predisposition to alcoholism will become a possibility, which could lead to therapeutic targets for alcoholism.

== Treatment ==

===Current Treatments===
Treatments for alcoholism aim to end ethanol consumption and provide social support to prevent relapse. In some cases, sedating medications ([[benzodiazepine]]s) may be necessary to prevent and/or reduce withdrawal symptoms. These benzodiazepines are only prescribed for a short period time to aid with withdrawal symptoms, for they too can become addictive.&lt;ref name="ninety-five"&gt;Blondell R.D. (February 2005). "Ambulatory detoxification of patients with alcohol dependence". Am Fam Physician 71 (3): 495–502.&lt;/ref&gt; Some other commonly used drugs on the market include:

;'''''[[Disulfiram]]'''''
:Disulfiram (trade name Antabuse) creates a sudden acute response to ethanol consumption by inhibiting an enzyme that metabolizes ethanol. In the liver, ethanol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenease to produce acetaladehye which is then metabolized by acetaldehyde dehydrogenease to produce acetic acid. Disulfiram interferes with the acetaldehyde dehydrogenease preventing acetaldehyde metabolism. This buildup of acetaldehyde is responsible for immediate “hangover” effects such as vomiting, nausea, and headaches.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, C.; Moore, R. D. (1990). "Disulfiram treatment of alcoholism". The American Journal of Medicine 88 (6): 647–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''[[Naltrexone]]'''''
:Naltrexone (trade name Revia) is an opioid antagonist that is thought to work by interfering with the dopaminergic [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic]] (or reward) pathway associated with risk-reward evaluation in the brain. This pathway starts at the ventral tegmental area and makes its way to the nucleus accumbens. Addictions of many drugs, including ethanol is commonly linked to this pathway. Naltrexone is thought to block or attenuate opioid stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;Latt N.C., Jurd S., Houseman J. and Wutzke S.E. (2002). "Naltrexone in alcohol dependence: a randomised controlled trial of effectiveness in a standard clinical setting." Med J Aust 2002; 176 (11): 530-534.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''[[Acamprosate]]'''''
:Acamprosate (trade name Campral) is believed to stabilize chemical balances in the brain that ethanol withdrawal would normally induce. In chronic ethanol users, ethanol binds to GABA receptors causing the down-regulation of GABA receptors; which are now less sensitive to the inhibitory GABA neurotransmitter. Acamprosate is thought to act as a GABA agonist that relieves anxiety associated with ethanol withdrawal, thereby promoting the discontinue use of ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, K., Kiefer, F., Spanagel, R. and Littleton, J. (2008), Acamprosate: Recent Findings and Future Research Directions. Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, 32: 1105–1110. doi: 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2008.00690.x&lt;/ref&gt;

These drug treatments are often coupled with social support through counseling, rehabilitation centers, and support groups. These social systems aid in dealing with the underlying social and psychological issues related to ethanol addiction.

===Future Epigenetic-Based Treatments===

====HDAC Inhibitors====
Chronic ethanol abuse up-regulates HDACs through oxidative stress in the brain; this leads to decreased histone acetylation and decreased NPY expression, especially in the amygdala. The lower levels of NPY are associated with increased ethanol consumption and increased anxiety in periods of ethanol withdrawal. Trichostatin A (TSA) is an HDAC inhibitor which has been shown to reverse these histone acetylation and NPY deficits by preventing and reversing HDAC up-regulation. TSA acted as an anxiolytic as it was able to reduce anxiety associated with ethanol withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;Agudelo M, Gandhi N, Saiyed Z, et al. Effects of Alcohol on Histone Deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and the Neuroprotective Role of Trichostatin A (TSA). Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research. 2011;35(8):1550-1556. doi:10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01492.x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suberanilohydroxamic Acid or SAHA is an HDAC inhibitor that reduces the motivation of rats to consume and/or seek ethanol, SAHA reduced binge drinking in rats by ending ethanol consumption periods sooner than in non-SAHA rats. SAHA was selective for reducing ethanol seeking but not sucrose seeking.&lt;ref name="hundred"&gt;Warnault V, Darcq E, Levine A, Barak S, Ron D. Chromatin remodeling — a novel strategy to control excessive alcohol drinking. Translational Psychiatry. 2013;3(2):e231-. doi:10.1038/tp.2013.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====DNMT Inhibitors====

In alcoholics, certain regions of the amygdala are associated with higher levels of DNA methyltransferases. 5-azacitidine (5-AzaC) in mice reduced excessive ethanol consumption. 5-AzaC decreases DNA methylation by inhibiting the activity of DNA methyltransferases. These results suggest ethanol consumption increases DNMT activity and that this histone modification can be reversed by DNMT inhibitors.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;

The '''National Institute for Biological Standards and Control''' ('''NIBSC''') is a global leader in the field of biological standardisation. It is a centre of the UK [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)]]. It is responsible for developing and producing over 90% of the biological international standards in use around the world.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} The Institute is the UK's [[Official Medicines Control Laboratory]] (OMCL), responsible for independent regulatory testing of biological medicines within the framework of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nibsc.org/about_us.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; It is also host to the UK Stem Cell Bank and a key UK research centre in the field of pandemic flu. It is situated just west of junction 23 of the [[M25 motorway|M25]]. Half of the building is in Ridge and the eastern half is in the parish of [[South Mimms]].

==History==
The NIBSC began work in May 1972. The National Biological Standards Board was formed in 1975 at the NIMR in [[Mill Hill]]. A site was selected and the new £25m building opened in 1987, although it was officially opened in 1988. It has 4,500 square metres of laboratories. NIBSC employs around 300 staff, 200 of whom are scientists.

In February 2008, it featured in a thirty-minute programme on [[BBC Radio 4]] in the ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/secretscience/ Secret Science]'' two-part series (the other programme was about the [[Health Protection Agency]]'s [[Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response]] at [[Porton Down]]).

In April 2009, NIBSC became centre of the UK [[Health Protection Agency|Health Protection Agency (HPA)]]. In April 2013, the NIBSC left the HPA and was merged with the UK’s [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency|Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)]].

==Function==
It produces over 90% of the [[World Health Organization|WHO]]'s International Standards for substances such as antibiotics, enzymes, [[Antibody|antibodies]] and hormones, and methods such as [[blood transfusion]]s. These standards form a vital part of global health efforts and pharmaceutical research, and over 10,000 standards a month are shipped worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9679">The '''[http://www.ohiopmp.gov Ohio Automated Rx Reporting System]''' (OARRS) is Ohio's state [[Prescription Monitoring Program]] (PMP) and is controlled by the Ohio State Board of Pharmacy.&lt;ref&gt;OARRS 2009 Handbook "[http://www.ohiopmp.gov/Documents/OH_PMP_Handbook-FINAL.pdf]"&lt;/ref&gt;  The law permitting the Board of Pharmacy to create the PMP was signed on March 18, 2005, and became effective January 1, 2006. The OARRS program began operation on October 2, 2006. The law is available to read in the Drug Laws of Ohio pages C-50 through C-54. The Ohio State Board of Pharmacy (The Board) is responsible for collecting and verifying data for prescriptions that the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) classifies Schedule II-V as well as [[carisoprodol]] and [[tramadol]] prescriptions.

== The law ==
The law establishing a database for keeping records of prescriptions is [[Ohio Revised Code]] 4729.75&lt;ref&gt;ORC 4729.75 "[http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/4729.75]"&lt;/ref&gt; and states:
:The state board of pharmacy may establish and maintain a drug database. The board shall use the drug database to monitor the misuse and diversion of controlled substances, as defined in section [http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3719.01 3719.01] of the Revised Code, and other dangerous drugs the board includes in the database pursuant to rules adopted under section [http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/4729.83 4729.83] of the Revised Code. In establishing and maintaining the database, the board shall electronically collect information pursuant to sections [http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/4729.77 4729.77] and [http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/4729.78 4729.78] of the Revised Code and shall disseminate information as authorized or required by sections [http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/4729.79 4729.79] and [http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/4729.80 4729.80] of the Revised Code. The board's collection and dissemination of information shall be conducted in accordance with rules adopted under section [http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/4729.83 4729.83] of the Revised Code.

== The purpose ==
OARRS was put into place, just like any other PMP, to be used as a tool for Ohio to address prescription drug abuse, addiction and diversion.&lt;ref&gt;DEA Drug Diversion FAQ "[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/faq/rx_monitor.htm]"&lt;/ref&gt;  It may serve several purposes such as:

*Support access to legitimate medical use of controlled substances
*Identify and deter or prevent drug abuse and diversion
*Facilitate and encourage the identification, intervention with and treatment of persons addicted to prescription drugs
*Inform public health initiatives through outlining of use and abuse trends
*Educate individuals about PMPs and the use, abuse and diversion of and addiction to prescription drugs

== Registration ==
In Ohio, registration for the OARRS program is limited to health care professionals and law enforcement. There are five different account types to choose from when registering.

'''Prescriber Master:''' an individual who is authorized to write prescriptions without the presence and/or authorization of another prescriber. Prescriber Master accounts can request OARRS reports as well as review ones requested by his/her delegates. Nurse Practitioners and Physician's Assistants with prescriptive authority are eligible for a Master Prescriber account. Residents and Interns who do not have a permanent medical license must register as a delegate.

'''Prescriber Delegate:''' In order to qualify for a Prescriber Delegate account, a user must be a licensed health care professional. This includes, but is not limited to, physicians assistants, nurses and pharmacists. The job duties of the delegate must be within the scope of his/her license in order to qualify for a delegate account. All Prescriber Delegate accounts must be linked with a Prescriber Master account.

'''Pharmacist:''' Only practicing pharmacists can register for this account. This means that the pharmacist in question must be practicing pharmacy as defined by the Ohio Revised Code.

'''Law Enforcement Supervisor:''' For a Law Enforcement Supervisor account, you must be a sworn officer of the law, working for a Law Enforcement Agency responsible for enforcing drug laws. Law Enforcement accounts are unique because two accounts are required to make a request. A Law Enforcement Supervisor is not capable of making a request. He or she can only approve requests made by a related Law Enforcement Officer account.

'''Law Enforcement Officer:''' For a Law Enforcement Officer account, you must be a sworn officer of the law, working for a Law Enforcement Agency responsible for enforcing drug laws. Law Enforcement accounts are unique in the aspect that two accounts are required to make a request. A Law Enforcement Officer can request both patient and prescriber history reports.  Every request made by a Law Enforcement Officer must be approved by a related Law Enforcement Supervisor. Therefore, there must be at least one Law Enforcement Supervisor related to a Law Enforcement Officer account. There may be more than one Supervisor for a single Officer and vice versa.

== Data submission ==
The format in which data is submitted to The Board is highly regulated as well. All data submitted to the OARRS system must be submitted according to the 2005 [http://www.asapnet.org American Society for Automation in Pharmacy] standards (ASAP). The following information is required for all record submissions to the Board:

* Patient's name, address, date of birth, telephone number and gender
* Prescription number
* [[National Drug Code]] (NDC) of dispensed medication
* Quantity of drug
* Days' supply
* Date of dispensing
* Date prescription was written or authorized
* Number of refills
* Refill number
* Prescriber's [[DEA number]] and DEA suffix if applicable
* Pharmacy's DEA number
* Pharmacy's name and telephone number
* Method of payment

=== Accepted mediums ===

The following information shows the accepted mediums that the State Board of Pharmacy accepts for data submission as well as the requirements for each medium.

'''SFTP:''' Secure File Transfer Protocol is the preferred method for data submission. The file format must be the pharmacy's DEA number, the file creation time in HHMMSS, and formatted with .TXT (ex. AB1234567.123441.TXT).

'''HTTPS:''' Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) is the method used to enter data on the OARRS website. ASAP formatted text files may also be uploaded via HTTPS.

'''CD:''' Compact Discs can be submitted to the State Board as long as the files are in the ASCII format. When submitting a CD, the pharmacy must:
* include the file name on the disc which must be the pharmacy's DEA number followed by .TXT
* label the front of the disc with the Pharmacy and/or Submitter's name, DEA number, and number of prescriptions on the disc
* include a Transmittal Form

'''Diskette:''' Diskettes are still accepted by the State Board but are not recommended as they can become corrupted during transit. Occasionally the State Board may request the data be resent in another format. If submitting a diskette, the pharmacy must:
* use a 3.5" floppy disk in ASAP 2005 format as ASCII files
* create a file name with the pharmacy's DEA number followed by .TXT
* label the front of the disc with the Pharmacy's name, DEA number, and number of prescriptions on the disc
* include a Transmittal Form

'''Paper:''' OARRS will accept written reports only if the State Board has granted a waiver in writing to the pharmacy. OARRS has to provide the pharmacy with a form to complete for written submissions. Again, all non-electronic submissions must be accompanied with a Transmittal Form.

== Data reception ==
After a data submission is received and updated, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the pharmacy contact which will confirm the date processed, the number of records received, the number of records with errors and the name of the submitted file. If there were errors in the data submission, a Microsoft Excel document will be attached to the e-mail and will not contain any Protected Health Information (PHI).

Receipt of paper forms will be provided via fax.

== Data rejection ==
Data may be rejected if it does not meet the requirements laid out by the ASAP 2005 standards. The entity submitting the data will be notified via e-mail.  Only the records containing errors will be rejected, not the entire file. For example, if Johnson's Pharmacy submits a CD with 75 records on it and 12 do not follow the ASAP 2005 standards, OARRS will reject those 12 records, not all 75 on the CD.

== Exceptions ==
If a pharmacy never dispenses any controlled substances, carisoprodol or tramadol prescriptions, that pharmacy can notify the State Board via a signed letter.  The State Board will then remove that pharmacy from a list of pharmacies that are expected to report to the OARRS system.

If no controlled substances, carisoprodol or tramadol are dispensed within a 7-day period, a pharmacy must submit a "Zero Report"

The pharmaceutical industry is one of the leading industries in the [[People's Republic of China]], covering synthetic chemicals and drugs, prepared Chinese medicines, medical devices, apparatus and instruments, hygiene materials, packing materials, and [[Pharmaceutics|pharmaceutical machinery]].

China accounts for 20% of the world's population but only 1.5% of the global [[drug]] market. China's [[healthcare system reform in the People's Republic of China|changing health-care environment]] is designed to extend basic [[health insurance]] to a larger portion of the population and give individuals greater access to products and services. Following the period of change, the pharmaceutical industry is expected to continue its expansion.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}
 
China, as of 2007, has around 3,000 to 6,000 domestic pharmaceutical manufacturers and around 14,000 domestic pharmaceutical distributors. The most often-cited adverse factors in the marketplace include a lack of protection of [[intellectual property rights]], a lack of visibility for drug approval procedures, a lack of effective governmental oversight, poor corporate support for drug research, and differences in the [[therapeutics|treatment]] in China that are accorded to local and foreign firms.&lt;ref name=unknownworldwatch&gt;{{Citation |author=unknown |publication-date=unknown date

Research and development are increasing, with Shanghai becoming one of the most important global drug research centers. Most notably, [[Novartis]] is expected to establish a large Research and development base in [[Shanghai]] that will be a pillar of its drug development.&lt;ref name=dyerft2006&gt;{{Citation |last=Dyer |first=Geoff |publication-date=Nov 5, 2006 |title=Novartis to open Shanghai research arm

China's thousands of domestic companies account for 70% of the market, the top 10 companies about 20%, according to Business China. In contrast, the top 10 companies in most developed countries control about half the market. Since June 30, 2004, the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) has been closing down manufacturers that do not meet the new GMP standards. Foreign players account for 10% to 20% of overall sales, depending on the types of medicines and ventures included in the count. However, sales at the top-tier Chinese companies are growing faster than at Western ones.

== Future growth ==
China is the world's second-largest [[prescription drug]] market, according to a report released by pharmaceutical market research firm [[IMS Health]]. The report said that China's pharmaceutical revenue is growing fast and that the market there may double by 2013. Sales of prescription drugs in China will grow by US$40 billion through 2013, the report said. The value-added output of China's pharmaceutical industry increased 14.9% year on year in 2009, according to statistics released by the [[Ministry of Industry and Information Technology]]. In the first 11 months of last year, the medicine sector's combined net profit was RMB 89.6 billion, up 25.9% year on year. Growth in the period was only 16.2% in the period from January to August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=[[Associated Press]] |publication-date=Mar 16, 2010 |title=IMS: China to be 3rd largest pharma market in 2011

== Overview ==
China has established a [[pharmaceutical industry]] structure, and has become one of the largest pharmaceutical producers in the world. The Chinese pharmaceutical industry has been growing at an average annual rate of 16.72% over the last few decades. However, the industry is still small-scale with a scattered geographical layout, duplicated production processes, and outdated manufacturing technology and management structures. The Chinese pharmaceutical industry also has a low market concentration and weak international trading competitiveness, coupled with a lack of patented domestically-developed pharmaceuticals. (Barnet Siu; 2010)

Investment conditions in China have improved due to the vast [[consumer demand]] for [[pharmaceuticals]], the lower [[Labour (economics)|labor]] costs and the changes resulting from [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|economic reform]]. Changes to the [[patent]]ing laws in full compliance with the requirement of the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (or "TRIPS Agreement") and the lack of Chinese pharmaceutical R&amp;D have also left gaps in the market.

The domestic pharmaceutical industry has been a key contributor to the country's impressive economic growth. As one of the world's major producers of pharmaceuticals, the sector achieved an annual compound growth rate of 16.7% between 1978 and 2003. Both far outpaced other economies in the world, making China the world's fastest growing pharmaceutical market. Although China has enjoyed the benefits of an expansive market for pharmaceutical production and distribution, the industry is suffering from minimal innovation and investment in R&amp;D and new product development. The sector's economies of scale have yet to be achieved. Most domestic manufacturers in the pharmaceutical industry lack the autonomic intellectual property and financial resources to develop their own brand products. Most manufacturers rely on the repetitive production of low value added bulk pharmaceuticals and imitation drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=staff |publication-date=unknown date |script-title=zh:中国药学会 &gt;&gt; 中国药学会联系方式 |work=cpa.org.cn

==Quality==
The Quality of drugs and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) made by Chinese pharmaceutical companies is often poor.
Quality is often poor, for example has Europe banned some APIs from Chinese drugmaker Zhuhai United where they found issues with aseptic manufacturing facilities and Huzhou Sunflower Pharmaceutical's plant in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, where French regulators turned up contamination issues in its manufacturing processes, see Europe bans some APIs from Chinese drugmaker Zhuhai United
June 22, 2015 By Eric Palmer http://www.fiercepharmamanufacturing.com/story/europe-bans-some-apis-chinese-drugmaker-zhuhai-united/2015-06-22

In the past three years 2015-2017, there were 35 FDA warning letters to Chinese pharmaceutical companies citing serious Data Integrity issues, including data deletion or manipulation or fabrication of test results, see “An Analysis Of 2017 FDA Warning Letters On Data Integrity” By Barbara Unger, Unger Consulting Inc.
https://www.pharmaceuticalonline.com/doc/an-analysis-of-fda-warning-letters-on-data-integrity-0003

See the long list of Chinese pharmaceutical companies which have been placed on Import Alert by the FDA due to serious noncompliance with Good Manufacturing Procedures  http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_189.html

See the European Medicines Agency EudaGMDP Noncompliance Reports based on Inspections of companies that revealed serious noncompliance with Good Manufacturing Procedures: 	http://eudragmdp.ema.europa.eu/inspections/gmpc/searchGMPNonCompliance.do

See FDA Warning Letters detailing serious noncompliance with Good Manufacturing Procedures:  http://www.fda.gov/iceci/enforcementactions/WarningLetters/default.htm


== Structure and trends ==
Currently China has about 3,500 drug companies, falling from more than 5,000 in 2004, according to government figures.{{Citation needed|reason=I'd love to see the date for "currently", and the document may have other useful information.|date=October 2013}} The number is expected to drop further. The domestic companies compete in the $10 billion market without a dominant leader. As of 2007, China is the world's ninth drug market, and in 2008 it will become the eighth largest market.

China's thousands of domestic companies account for 70 percent of the market, and the top 10 companies about 20 percent, according to Business China. In contrast, the top 10 companies in most developed countries control about half the market. Since June 30, 2004, the [[State Food and Drug Administration]] (SFDA) has been closing down manufacturers that do not meet the new [[Good Manufacturing Practice|GMP]] standards. Foreign players account for 10% to 20% of overall sales, depending on the types of medicines and ventures included in the count. But sales at the top-tier [[Chinese companies]] are growing faster than at Western ones, according to IMS Health Inc.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Even the top selling companies just barely exceed sales of $100 million ([[hospital]] market). Most of the Chinese drug-makers fall below the 20th ranking, but 30 of the top 50 companies are local.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

In addition, China's [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] market is growing fast and has become the fourth largest OTC market in the world. Foreign enterprises have been closely monitoring the expanding OTC market. [[Merck KGaA|Merck]] announced the launch of OTC program in China in September 2003. [[Roche Holding AG|Roche]] listed China as one of its 10 core OTC markets, with the aim of growing its OTC drug sales by 50% in the next five years and reaching 1.3 billion in 2008. [[Novartis]] is expanding its OTC market share in China, and [[Wyeth]] has also entered OTC market.

The pharmaceutical market in China is dominated by its non-branded [[Generic drug|generic]] industry that operates with basic technology and simple production methods. Domestic pharmaceuticals are not as technologically advanced as western products, but nonetheless occupy approximately 70% of the market in China. Domestic companies are mainly government owned and fraught with overproduction and losses. The Chinese government has begun consolidating and upgrading the industry in an effort to compete with foreign corporations.

It is estimated that most [[hospital]]s derive 25-60% of their revenue from prescription sales, hospitals remain the main outlets for distributing pharmaceuticals in China. This will change with the separation of [[hospital pharmacy|hospital pharmacies]] from healthcare services and with the growing numbers of retail pharmacy outlets. [[Retail]] pharmacy outlets are expected to grow in number once the government finally introduces its system to classify drugs as OTC. The government is now encouraging development of chain drug stores, but the full effect might not be seen for several years.

The price of pharmaceutical products will continue to decrease steadily.  In June 2004, the price of 400 [[antibiotics]] in 24 categories, including [[penicillin]], was reduced by, on average, 35%. The total value affected by this reduction was US$42 million. The central government has been playing a significant role in pharmaceutical price readjustment. The government compelled and continually 32 times reduced the price of most of the drugs in last 20 years since 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Caijun|last2=Wu|first2=Lina|last3=Cai|first3=Wenfang|last4=Zhu|first4=Wenwen|last5=Shen|first5=Qian|last6=Li|first6=Zongjie|last7=Fang|first7=Yu|date=2016-10-25|title=Current Situation, Determinants, and Solutions to Drug Shortages in Shaanxi Province, China: A Qualitative Study|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165183|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=11|issue=10|pages=e0165183|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0165183|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future price reductions will originate from hospital pharmaceutical retail shops.

The rural pharmaceutical market will shift significantly.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} 80% of [[counterfeit]] products are consumed in [[rural]] areas.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} This provides a huge opportunity for [[pharmaceutical companies]] to develop the market in rural areas. In 2005, Huanan Pharmaceutical Group, Guangzhou Ruobei Huale, Baiyunshan Pharmaceutical Group, and others, have stepped up efforts in targeting the rural market.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The China Pharmaceutical Equipment Industry 2015 Market Research Report is a professional and in-depth study on the current state of the Pharmaceutical Equipment industry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qyresearchreports.com/report/china-pharmaceutical-equipment-industry-2015-market-research-report.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historic foreign involvement ===
[[Bayer]] of Germany, the inventor of [[aspirin]], began trade with China in as early as 1882. [[Hoechst AG]], known as [[Aventis]], sold its products through 128 distribution agents across China in 1887, becoming China's no. 1 Western medicine and dyeing provider. [[Eli Lilly and Company]] opened its first overseas representative office in [[Shanghai]] in 1918. ICI, the predecessor of the world's no. 3 pharmaceutical enterprise [[AstraZeneca]], began trade with China in 1898.

=== Production levels ===
In the 9 months from January to September 2004, the total output of the country's pharmaceutical industry reached $40 billion, 15.8% higher than the same period of 2003. In the same period, 23 major [[state-owned]] pharmaceutical companies had sales of $10 billion. A survey of 16 typical city hospitals, the usage of drugs increased by 32.23% in the first half of 2004 as compared with that of 2003.

Around 36% of all China's pharmaceutical enterprises are state-owned. Another 35% are privately owned domestic enterprises and the remaining 29%, foreign-funded. Synthetic drug manufacturing remains the pharmaceutical industry's largest business in China, constituting 65% of industry sales. Another 21% of industry sales come from [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. [[Biotech]]-related medical products and [[medical equipment]] make up the rest.

====Regional distribution====
China's huge and gradually aging population and strong biopharmaceutical sector have almost guaranteed a large but varied pharmaceutical market profile. [[Zhejiang]], [[Guangdong]], [[Shanghai]], [[Jiangsu]] and [[Hebei]] provinces have always been among the top five most productive provinces in China. Each of these provinces has grown steadily by an average of 20 per cent per annum from 1998 to 2003 (with the exception of Jiangsu in 1998 and 1999) and reflects an increasingly healthy developing trend in the Chinese pharmaceutical industry.

Most pharmaceutical firms are located in the southeastern zone that includes two well-developed areas and three under-developed areas. The two most popular areas of well-developed pharmaceutical industry, called the growth poles, are the [[East China|Eastern China]] zone of which [[Zhejiang]] province is located in the centre and the [[Northern and southern China|South China]] zone represented by the [[Guangdong]] province. The total output value of these two provinces accounted for 21 per cent of the total output value of pharmaceutical industry of China in 2003.

The three sub-developed areas of pharmaceutical industry, called the potential points, are also identified as the Middle China Zone, the Northeastern Zone and the Southwestern Zone, centralised in [[Hebei]] Province, [[Heilongjiang]] province and [[Sichuan]] province, respectively.

The development of the pharmaceutical industry in China was found to be predominantly driven by economic factors. The nature of an industrial region can roughly fall into one of the following three types: [[natural resource]]-driven region, economy-driven region and science and technology-driven region. The pharmaceutical industry in China grows well only in areas with a strong macroeconomic background rather than in regions with rich natural resources or advanced science and technology. Moreover, it is shown that the stronger the macro-economy, the faster the pharmaceutical industry grows. Therefore, the decision-making policy on pharmaceutical development in a region should be largely based on its macroeconomic situation.

Broadly speaking, it appears that the dynamic features of the pharmaceutical industry in China remain steady. According to the reform plan, China will conduct a regime of vertical management in drug supervision and management departments, intensify supervision and control over medicines, and gradually set up a drug management system featuring legal management, unified law enforcement, standard codes of conduct, honest practice and high efficiency. To meet the objective requirements of drug administration and the needs of the development of medical services, a drug supervision and management body was formed in 1998.

The pharmaceutical industry in China was found to be extensively fragmented. Excessive repetitive establishment of provincial pharmaceutical industries was found to be serious in comparison to other industries in China. It also demonstrates a low-level, repetitive development situation of the pharmaceutical industry in different regions of China.

Currently in China, the pharmaceutical industry is undoubtedly still developing. The most desirable strategy has been, therefore, to concentrate on the regional pharmaceutical industries. There are three main reasons for this strategy: high profitability and growth of the pharmaceutical industry, unnecessary political competition among regions, and excessive exploitation of regional administrative power. (Hu Yuanjia; 2007)

The pharmaceutical industry is always known as a high-return and rapidly growing industry. After the Chinese market was reformed, China gradually makes space for a healthy, steady and rapidly developing pharmaceutical industry, where profit rate and growth rate are much higher than in other industries. In the view of high profit returns, regional governments often allow excessive development of regional medicine industries without careful analysis of regional competitiveness, actual advantages and development strategies to [[incentive|incentivise]] the regional development of the entire economy.

In China, drug administration departments are established at both central and regional governmental level. Every region has a regional drug administration department with some authority and power. Without good communication and cooperation between administration department, unnecessary competition between regions might occur. The number of drug companies under each administrative department is often wrongly recorded resulting in an inaccurate evaluation index of the regional economic development and governmental performance.

Complex regulatory processes induce excessive exploitation of regional administrative power. Before the revision of Chinese Pharmaceutical Law in 2001, the province drug administration was assigned with authority to streamline the process of registering a [[generic drug]]. Consequently, this regional authority power was exploited resulting in excessive duplication of the same drugs. For example, a [[fluoroquinolone]] type medicine was registered and manufactured by more than 1,000 enterprises. Fortunately, the Chinese government immediately realised the serious problem and withdrew the regional authority power to prevent overlapping of authorities. Duplication of drug is, however, not the only example. After the allocation of authority of approval right of opening drug companies was taken down to provincial level several years ago, a sharp increase in the number of drug companies was noted. It was reported that 70 new drug production enterprises were approved to open during the first half of 2003, while only 45 similar enterprises were approved to open during the three years from 1998 to 2001.

=== Research and development ===
With their low budget for [[research and development]], China's pharmaceutical makers are in a different league from the [[multinational corporation|multinationals]], but they do enjoy certain advantages. Many Chinese companies not only produce the [[dosage form]]s (such as tablets) but also own the [[pharmacy|pharmacies]] where they are [[Dispensing chemist|dispensed]], as well as the distribution networks that deliver them to the hospitals, where nearly 80% of drugs are sold. In addition, Chinese companies can produce [[Generic drug|generic]] versions of branded drugs for a fraction of their price.

Of the 3,000 pharmaceuticals - not including traditional medicines - manufactured in China since the 1950s, 99 percent are copies of foreign products, as are almost 90 percent of China's [[biotech]] products. Most Chinese companies - even [[joint venture]]s - compete with each other for the same generics. Many are struggling for survival; more than 32 percent recorded losses in 1999, according to the Pharmaceutical Department of [[National Development and Reform Commission]].

Moreover, compared with international pharma giants, Chinese companies are not only small, but are weak in [[technology]] and often lack [[capital (economics)|capital]]. The total R&amp;D expenditures for Chinese-owned [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharma]] businesses amounted to less than that spent by a single major Western pharma company.

There are presently more than 5,000 research and development (R&amp;D) institutions in China, but only a handful of them are able to compete internationally in certain areas.

The R&amp;D system consists of specialized research institutes, major universities, biotechnology companies, and R&amp;D divisions of large pharmaceutical enterprises. In recent years, mid- and small-size [[biotechnology]] companies are developing at a rapid pace. There are more than 1,000 such entities nationwide at present, and more than 30% of them are privately owned. Special governmental funds are available to promote this type of [[entrepreneurship]].

During the past several years, some Chinese pharmaceutical companies began to establish R&amp;D infrastructures largely due to internal growth needs, but their primary focus is directed toward improving existing technologies or developing [[generic drug|generic version of new drugs]].

Companies to expand research efforts in China include GlaxoSmithKline,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GSK betting on China's healthcare growth|url=http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/glaxosmithkline_chinese_healthcare_growth_391080|publisher=PMLiVE|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bayer expands research deal with university in China|url=http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/bayer_expands_research_deal_university_china_396196|publisher=PMLiVE|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bristol-Myers Squibb,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BMS signs cardiovascular research deal with China's Simcere|url=http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/bms_cvd_partnership_china_simcere_353886|publisher=PMLiVE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merck &amp; Co&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merck pledges $1.5bn for China expansion|url=http://www.pmlive.com/find_an_article/allarticles/categories/General/2011/december_2011/news/merck_china_research_development_beijing_facility|publisher=PMLiVE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Eli Lilly &amp; Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lilly extends contract with Chinese CRO ShangPharma|url=http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/lilly_extends_contract_china_cro_shangpharma_356860|publisher=PMLiVE|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison of Chinese and Western pharmaceutical companies ===
Like its U.S. and European counterparts, the Chinese pharma business is regulated by government agencies, and competition is fierce in the business. The biggest differences include following: 
* most Chinese pharma companies are [[generic drug]] manufacturers;
* a large number are [[traditional Chinese medicine]] manufacturers;
* [[hospital]]s are still the major drug market;
* [[patent]] issues are the greatest weakness of Chinese producers.

When the Chinese are developing an [[Active ingredient|API]] they try patent searches via the [[internet]], but are limited by the scope of the available services. Few factories yet have patent attorneys on staff, but for the larger pharma groups who are seeking partnerships with large Western firms, this may come soon.&lt;ref name="Dow Jones, IMS, 2004"&gt;Dow Jones, IMS, China Pharmaceutical Industry Research Report 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese business environment is mainly relationship-based, and this is reflected in the pharmaceutical business.  Establishing relationship with a pharma companies through personal connections is a common way to contact Chinese pharma companies. Attending pharmaceutical exhibitions, pharmaceutical conferences or seminars is another approach, as is holding a press conference attended by officials of related government agencies or associations and senior pharmaceutical executives.&lt;ref name="Dow Jones, IMS, 2004"/&gt;

=== Domestic companies ===

{{See also category|Pharmaceutical companies of China}}

From 2003 to 2004, the number of pharmacies climbed to 200,000 from 180,000, and the number of retailers owning chain stores rose from 1200 to 1349.

Before the 1980s, the distribution channel for China's [[pharmacy]] products was [[vertically integrated]], as there were few [[Reseller|middlemen]] for [[medicine]] sales and the only [[wholesalers]] were the [[traditional Chinese medicine|traditional]] pharmacy stores. However, after the 1980s, with the deepening of China's reforms, the distribution of China's pharmacy products have undergone profound changes that have to some extent changed this.

At present, there are three main distribution channels for China's pharmacy enterprises:
*Pharmacy enterprises - national general agent - sub wholesaler - retailers – patients
Under this distribution form, there is a sole authorized organization in the country that is responsible for the sale of one or more products of a pharmacy company. Such kind of distribution also can be called "the national agent mode." The pharmacy company is responsible for the manufacturing, research and development of the products, and the general agent for the nationwide sale of the products of the company.  There are mainly three national distribution agencies in mainland before 2010: Sinopharm Group, Shanghai Pharma and CR Pharmaceutical. In most cases, the agents buy the pharmacy products with cash after weighing the costs and profits, and the market risks lie with the wholesalers.

*Pharmacy enterprises - regional general agents (sub wholesalers) — retailers - patients
Under this mode, the pharmacy enterprise search for its national or regional general agent and use the agent's market network to sell its products. Such kind of distribution mode can be called "the regional general agent mode."  The pharmacy enterprise usually entrusts its general agent with the sale of its products through a bidding process or forming alliance with the agent, providing it products at a bottom price. The agent, after buying a certain amount of products, win the authorization from the pharmacy company to sell in a specific region and becomes its sole authorized agent in the region. The regional general agent can be the general wholesaler in a big region, provincial wholesaler, district wholesaler or municipal wholesaler, etc. In a big region or in a province, regional general agents provide patients with their products through sub-wholesalers and retailers. In a small place such as a county, products can go directly from the regional general agent to retailers and then to patients, without the involvement of sub wholesalers. 
*Marketing companies of pharmacy enterprises - local offices of pharmacy companies — retailers - patients
Before taking such a distribution channel, the pharmacy enterprise should first register an independent licensed marketing company, and then set up offices in major cities which are responsible for monitoring sales and distribution of its products in their respective regions. Such a distribution mode, which requires large amount of capital and high-level management for the pharmacy enterprise, is mostly used by large-sized pharmacy enterprises.

In the above-mentioned modes, pharmacy enterprises, middlemen and patients are three basic components. Middlemen can also be classified under the categories of wholesalers and retailers. Retailers include those with shops, without shops and retail groups. What needs to be pointed out is that in China, the biggest pharmacy retailer is the hospital, due to the country's medicare and social security mechanisms. In the retail market, 85% of pharmacy products go to patient through hospitals.

Hence, the major distribution channels in China can also be described as the following:
*pharmacy enterprises—hospitals-patients; pharmacy enterprises—wholesalers—hospitals—patients;
*pharmacy enterprises—agents—wholesalers—retailers—patients;
*pharmacy enterprises—retailers—patients.

The first two modes are the leading ones in China.

In recent years, China's pharmacy enterprises have entered two new fields: [[e-business]] and the setting up of [[pharmacy]] retailing chain stores. At present, the development of the B to C mode of pharmacy business in China is limited.

[[Business-to-business|B2B]] is the main development trend of China's e-pharmacy commerce. Though the trade volume of B2B e-pharmacy business only makes up a percentage of the total pharmacy sales, it still has large development potential.  In China's case, the B2B e-pharmacy commerce has grown by 300 percent yearly. In 2003, the trade volume of internet pharmacy sales was estimated to be 10 percent of the total.

In addition, more and more IT and other industry lead companies have been shifting their investments into the pharmaceutical industry.  One example is Fang Zheng Group, an IT company that had invested a total of US$363 million into pharmaceuticals and healthcare. Guangzhou Bai Yun Shan Pharmaceutical Manufactory earmarked US$12 million to start an external-use medicine project, which was in addition to its US$48 million antibiotics project.

=== Domestic companies doing R&amp;D ===
To date, the Chinese domestic pharmaceutical industry has invested very little in the [[research and development]] of new drugs, though the [[central government]] is encouraging R&amp;D through [[investment]] and other [[incentive]]s in an effort to build a world-class pharmaceutical industry.

*[[C &amp; O Pharmaceutical Technology Holdings]] Ltd. (SIN:COPT) is an integrated pharmaceutical group in China which boasts an extensive distribution network covering over 3,000 distributors and 300,000 clinics, pharmacies and hospitals across all parts of China. To expand its portfolio of proprietary drugs, the company is developing a range of drugs that address acute medical areas such as anti-infection, anti-HBV, anti-cancer, anti-tuberculosis, anti-aging and anti-obesity. Three potential Category 1 drugs are also under development: an anti-Hepatitis B drug, a new immuno-enhancer drug and alternative drug to cancer treatment, and an antibiotics drug which is more effective against a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens, especially Gram-positive drug-resistant bacteria.  With 80 in-house researchers who have been handpicked for their specialties in different fields, ranging from chemical synthesis, drug formulation and preparation methods to clinical research, product registration, manufacturing techniques and pharmaceutical analysis, C&amp;O is one of the few qualified pharmaceutical companies in China with the expertise to provide contract research services to the growing number of international pharmaceutical companies seeking to outsource their R&amp;D activities to China. C&amp;O has been providing contract research and contract manufacturing services to pharmaceutical companies both in China and outside of China.
*[[Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co. Ltd.]] (SHA: 600276), headquartered in Lianyungang, Jiangsu Province, is one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in China.

*[[Shijiazhuang Pharma Group]]: Based in [[Shijiazhuang]], the capital city of [[Hebei]] Province in northeast China, the pharma group is one of the largest pharma industries of China. In November 2004, the group announced the official launch of its investigative drug [[butylphthalide]] (NBP). The group acquired [[patents]] of the drug from Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences for less than $4 million, and spent only $6.3 million on [[clinical trial]]s. [[Shijiazhuang Pharma Group]] is very typical in the new drug development. The company uses three ways: first, develop new drugs in collaboration with universities and research institutes; second, apply for generic drugs rights before patented drugs’ patents expire; and third, modernize the traditional Chinese medicines (TCM), that is, develop TCMs in the same quantitative way as is used in developing chemical drugs. The third way was used in the development of butylphthalide, a traditional Chinese medicine extracted from celery seeds.
*[[Wuxi Pharmatech]]: WuXi PharmaTech (Cayman), Inc., through its subsidiaries, operates as a pharmaceutical and [[biotechnology]] research and development [[outsourcing]] company in the People's Republic of China. It provides a portfolio of [[laboratory]] and [[manufacturing]] services in the [[drug discovery]] and [[drug development|development]] process to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In addition, WuXi PharmaTech's services include process development, such as process research and [[process optimization]] services to assist customers to manufacture their drug candidates; and manufacturing of advanced intermediates, which are drug materials prior to refinement into [[active pharmaceutical ingredient]]s. Listed on the New York Stock Exchange: Stock symbol ADR (NYSE) WX.
*[[Harbin Pharmaceutical Group]] Co. is about to become more competitive, with a planned $250 million capital infusion from two foreign investors, [[Warburg Pincus]] of New York and Citic Capital of Hong Kong. That money will allow Harbin to expand its R&amp;D efforts—the company spends about 5% of revenue on R&amp;D, exceptional for a Chinese drug maker yet just a third of what most multinationals spend—and help it become predator rather than prey as the consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry gets more ferocious.
*[[Sinovac Biotech]] Ltd. (AMEX:SVA) has recently launched marketing of Bilive and expects to record its first sales in May 2005 a combined [[Hepatitis]] A&amp;B vaccine. This is the first combined inactivated Hepatitis A&amp;B vaccine developed by Chinese scientists, and the vaccine has only one directly competing combined Hepatitis A&amp;B vaccine in the world, GSK ‘s Twinrix, which is not available in China and sells for a much higher price than Bilive in countries where it is for sale. In 2004, the company had sales about $6.5 million sales, more than two times 2003 sales. Sinovac now has two vaccines fully approved for sale in China. It is currently the world leader in the development of a [[SARS]] vaccine.
*[[Zensun (Shanghai) Sci &amp; Tech Co., Ltd]] is a bio-tech pharmaceutical company well-versed in the demands of the international market with a high profit potential based on innovation. It is devoted to the research and development of new drugs through self-owned intellectual properties.  With adherence to the tenet of "healing for life", Zensun has long been focusing on the research of anti-tumor drugs and anti-heart failure drugs. Based on the innovative theory, Zensun has successfully developed two drugs:  Recombinant Human Neuregulin-1 injection, an anti-heart failure drug, and Recombinant Human ErbB3 fragment injection, a therapeutic vaccine against tumors, both of which have undergone clinical trials. In 2006, Zensun (Shanghai) set up a subsidiary company, Zensun (USA), Inc., in San Diego, CA to manage FDA filing, clinical trials and commercialization process of Recombinant Human Neuregulin-1 (Neucardin), an exciting and novel treatment for chronic heart failure, as well as other compounds developed by Zensun (Shanghai). In 2009, Zensun (USA) was approved by the US FDA to conduct a Phase 2a US-based trial of Neucardin administration to subjects with NYHA Class II and III Chronic Heart Failure.
*Tonghua Dongbao Pharmaceuticals Ltd., founded in 1985, is a bio-tech pharmaceutical with headquarters, research and manufacturing facilities situated in China's Northern city of [[Tonghua]]. In 1998 Tonghua Dongbao became the 3rd company worldwide to successfully develop and manufacture its own recombinant human insulin line, Gansulin, for the treatment of Diabetes Mellitus. Its recombinant human insulin production base is the largest of its kind in Asia, producing both vials of insulin and insulin cartridges for the Gansulin Insulin Pen. The company is accelerating expansion into markets outside of China, currently exporting insulin and a variety of other medicines to over 10 countries.

=== Foreign expansion ===
Most Chinese pharma companies with foreign distribution export [[traditional Chinese medicine]] mainly to [[Asia]]n countries or regions. Their foreign distribution, therefore, is not as significant as their western counterparts.

The Chinese government legalized foreign ownership of retail pharmacies in 2003. On March 14, 2005, AXM Pharma Inc. (AMEX: AXJ) entered into a distribution agreement with Sinopharm Holding Guangzhou Co., Ltd. for an expected purchase amount through December 2005 of RMB 54 million ($6.56 million) for the Company's line of Elegance products, formerly known as Whisper.

Additional products, including Anti-Fatigue and Asarone, are expected to be sold in upcoming quarters. The sales territory includes [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Yunnan]], [[Guizhou]], [[Fujian]], [[Sichuan]], [[Chongqing]], [[Hainan]], [[Hubei]] and [[Hunan]].

[[Sinopharm]] Holding Guangzhou Co., Ltd., an affiliate of [[China National Pharmaceutical Group]] Corp. is actively engaged in the research and development, capital investment, manufacture and trade of pharmaceuticals and medical instruments. Sinopharm has achieved an annual sales volume of 10 billion RMB (over 1.2 billion U.S. Dollars) and a total import and export volume of 200 million U.S. Dollars.

=== Foreign companies ===
In recent years, more and more western pharmaceutical corporations, such as [[GlaxoSmithKline|GSK]], [[Hoffmann–La Roche|Roche]], [[Novo Nordisk]], and others, have come to China and set up R&amp;D centers. Many world leading pharmaceutical companies have established [[joint venture]] manufactories in China. Some have even set up sole propriety manufactories. As of 2004, amongst the largest 500 overseas enterprises, 14 of them are pharmaceutical companies.

As of 2004 (three years after China's WTO entry), nearly all global pharmaceutical companies have already completed their accession into the Chinese market and will gradually shift their focus to research development. The main reasons for overseas companies coming to China have been to save costs by using the extensive [[Science, technology and society|science and technology]] research bases currently in place in China, the abundant [[human resources]], and less expensive medical and [[clinical trial]]s.

=== Foreign production ===
The involvement of many foreign pharmacy enterprises operating in China can be dated back to a century ago. [[Bayer]] of Germany, the inventor of [[aspirin]], began trade with China in as early as 1882. [[Hoechst AG]], known as [[Aventis]], sold its products through 128 distribution agents across China in 1887, becoming China's No.1 Western medicine and dyeing provider.  The US [[Eli Lilly]] &amp; Co. opened its first overseas representative office in China's Shanghai in 1918. ICI, the predecessor of the world's No 3 pharmacy enterprise [[AstraZeneca]], began trade with China in 1898, and still maintained its old-time office by the Huangpu River in Shanghai.

As of 2007, there were already 1,800 foreign-funded pharmaceutical enterprises in China [Reference: https://web.archive.org/web/20080513032052/http://www.pacificbridgemedical.com/publications/html/ChinaDec1998.htm]. Currently, all the top 20 pharmaceutical companies in the world have set up [[joint venture]]s or wholly owned facilities in China. This suggests that market conditions have never been more challenging, with competition at an all-time high.

*[[Pfizer]] produces and markets more than 40 innovative drugs in China, and the quality of its products all met the [[Chinese Pharmacopeia]]. Pfizer has [[Good manufacturing practice|GMP]] manufacturing facilities in [[Dalian]], [[Suzhou]] and [[Wuxi]]. Its Dalian facility, built in 1989 jointly with Dalian Pharmaceuticals was the first to get GMP certification in China. Pfizer has invested more than $500 million in China. Lastly, in 2012 Pfizer established a joint venture with Hisun Pharmaceuticals (Hisun 51% - Pfizer 49%) to market branded generics under the label Hisun-Pfizer.
*[[GlaxoSmithKline]] has more than 2000 employees in China, and its drugs are sold in 60 cities. The company mainly sells drugs treating HBV, asthmas and infections.
*[[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]] sells [[antibiotics]], [[prostate]] drugs, [[cardiovascular]] drugs, [[pain relief|pain relievers]], [[osteoporosis]] and [[vaccines]]. It set up its first joint venture in China in 1994.
*[[Novartis]] has invested about 100 million{{Clarify|date=March 2017}} in China, with four manufacturing facilities in Beijing and Shanghai (Changsu). Its core businesses involve patented drugs, generic drugs, eye protection drugs and health products. Novartis Beijing was founded by Novartis AG and Beijing Pharmaceutical group and Beijing Zizhu Pharmaceuticals in 1987, the first foreign pharmaceutical company in China.
*[[Sanofi-Aventis]] The German-French company sells several drugs in China. Sanofi Aventis runs three facilities in Beijing,  Shenzhen and Hangzhou; currently, they're in the process of building a brand new Vaccine Plant outside Shenzhen.
*[[AstraZeneca]] Pharmaceutical Co. has its headquarters in Shanghai, with 25 branch offices in major cities across China's mainland. In 2001, the company established its largest manufacturing site in Asia with a total investment of $170 million in [[Wuxi]]. It sells several products, including [[Seroquel]] and [[Nexium]]. It has nearly 3,000 employees working in manufacturing, sales, clinical research and new product development. It has a presence in more than 110 targeted cities, with around 800 representatives.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.astrazeneca.com.cn/article/502748.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219172911/http://en.astrazeneca.com.cn/article/502748.aspx |date=19 December 2007 }}
*[[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] is one of the earliest to enter Chinese market.
*[[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] sells Tynoline and other drugs in China.
*[[Wyeth]]’s best-seller in China includes Calcium-D.
*[[Roche Applied Science|Roche]] launched a medical education campaign targeting 3,500 doctors in 20 Chinese cities in 2004.
*[[Schering-Plough]] is a worldwide pharmaceutical company committed to discovering, developing and marketing of new medicines that can improve people's health and extend life. The company is the recognized leader in biotechnology, genomics and gene therapy. [[Shanghai Schering-Plough]] Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, with a total investment of US 37 million, was founded on August 5, 1994 as a joint-venture, with Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry (Group) Corporation and Shanghai Corporation of Pharmaceutical Economic and Technical International Cooperation.
*Bayer Greater China is [[Bayer]]'s second largest single market in Asia, accounting for approximately one quarter of regional sales. Its interests in this region have grown steadily over the years, from step-by-step investment in the early 1990s to large-scale, world-class facilities today. Bayer's investment in our integrated production site in the Shanghai Chemical Industry Park makes it evident that Bayer regards Greater China as one of its most important markets worldwide. Bayer's Greater China Group operates in the market encompassing Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China. The Bayer Group in Greater China is led by management holding companies, with the subgroups and production joint ventures operating independently under their strategic direction.  The Country Group Speaker, Dr. Elmar Stachels, leads the Group in Greater China. The Greater China Group employs ca. 2,800 people across a wide range of functions. Companies and Locations: Bayer currently operates 18 companies in Greater China.  Eight of them now have production facilities on stream in all business segments in which the company is active. Local production accounts for an increasing proportion of sales. Bayer China is engaged in a number of cooperation projects with some of the foremost research institutes and universities in China, to conduct research in the field of innovative materials, health care and crop science. It strongly cooperates with the Chinese Academy of Science and affiliated institutes such as the Institute of Materia Medica and the [[Kunming Institute of Botany]] in [[Yunnan]] with the aim to identify new compounds in the healthcare and crop science field.  There are also a number of projects currently being started in polymers research. In addition, Bayer also supports a number of chairs and programmes for research and teaching at Chinese universities.  These include the Tsinghua-Bayer Public Health and HIV/AIDS Media Studies Program, a national platform designed to play a key role in China's public health system. Furthermore, Bayer HealthCare supports a chair for Healthcare Management at the China European International Business School (CEIBS) in Shanghai.
*[[Boehringer Ingelheim]] entered Chinese market in 1995 and invested $25 million in a new facility in Shanghai in 2002. Its drugs treating respiratory diseases and cardiovascular diseases have established well in Chinese pharmaceutical markets.
*[[Hoechst Marion Russel]] established its China head offices in Beijing in 1995 to manage operations in mainland China and Hong Kong. HMR has two joint ventures in China, Hoechst Huabei Pharmaceuticals Ltd in Shijiazhuang, a heartland of the Chinese pharmaceutical industry, and Hoechst Shanghai International Pharmaceuticals Ltd.
*[[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] set up its first overseas office in Shanghai in 1918 and returned to Shanghai, China in 1993. Its main facility is in Suzhou, Jiangsu province and main products include Ceclor, insulin, and erectile dysfunction drug ED.
*[[Abbott Laboratories]] Ltd sells a series of products including baby food in China.
*[[Xian-Janssen]]: Among foreign-invested ventures in China, [[Janssen Pharmaceutica|Xian-Janssen Pharmaceutical]], located in [[Xi'an]] is regarded as a model. It has ranked among the top 10 joint ventures in terms of revenue since 1991, thrice landing in the number one spot. The company's success is due partly to its product line, which includes a range of high-volume sellers: medicines to treat gastronintestinal problems, fungi, allergies and pain, as well as psychosis and epilepsy. But it was Dr. [[Paul Janssen]]’s decision to enter China early, to invest inland, and to keep investment plans moving along in the wake of 1989 Tiananmen Square event that have helped build its good relations with the Chinese government. [[Paul Appermont]] and [[Joos Horsten]] lead the Xian-Janssen Pharmaceutical project.
*[[Degussa]] is shifting a large proportion of its pharmaceutical chemicals production from Europe to China in order to take advantage of low-cost manufacturing and improved production efficiencies in the country. At the same time, the company will restructure some of its large production facilities, the vast majority of them in Germany, which could result in the transfer of the manufacture of other products to China.
*[[Rhodia (company)|Rhodia]] is improving its competitive position in analgesics by reinforcing its more cost-effective manufacturing operations. The company is making a major investment in its Wuxi, China, paracetamol (acetaminophen or APAP) production facility and consolidating its North American and European operations. Rhodia shuttered its Luling, La., paracetamol operations in 2004 and consolidated production in Roussillon, France, and Wuxi, China. Following these changes, paracetamol production capacity will be adjusted to match current levels.

Japanese companies:
*[[Sankyo Co.|Sankyo]]: Having previously generated revenues from exports to local agencies allied with its own marketing, Sankyo completed a plant for manufacturing its drugs in October 2003, and plans to expand its own marketing. It expects to double the number of marketing representatives (MRs) to 130 in 2004, and increase sales in China from ¥3.0 billion currently (company estimate for 2003) to ¥5.0 billion within a few years. Sankyo already markets hyperlipemic Mevalotin, anti-inflammatory Loxonin, and antibiotic Banan in China, and plans to market hypertensive Olmesartan (currently under development) there in future.
*[[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]]: The company basically does its own marketing (sales value estimated to be ¥1-2 billion). It also has a manufacturing plant. In 2004 Takeda planned to launch diabetes drug Actos in China, and then it will be marketing all four global products (Actos, anti-ulcer Takepron, cancer drug Leuplin, and hypertensive Blopress). However, the US has priority in its overseas strategy, followed by Europe and then Asia.
*[[Yamanouchi]]: The firm moved into China in 1994 and does most of its own marketing, covering anti-ulcer Gaster and urinary impediment treatment Harnal among its leading products. Sales are gradually expanding, and operating profitability was achieved in 2001. Accumulated losses have been wiped out during F2003. The company owns a manufacturing plant. In 2004, there are plans to launch Dolner for peripheral circulation, anti-emetic Nazea OD, and hypertensive Hypoca. Yamanouchi does not have plans to increase its 110 MRs significantly at this point.
*[[Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co.|Daiichi]]: Shifted to in-house marketing after establishing a sales subsidiary in 1998, mainly selling synthetic antibacterials Cravit (oral and injectable) and Tarivid. It originally planned to launch neurotransmission enhancer Translon too, but after development was halted in Japan, development in China also ended. In 1998, it forecast sales of ¥12.0 billion in 2002, but only actually recorded ¥1.6 billion. Sales are behind plan chiefly due to the suspension of Translon's development and the proliferation of generic and copycat versions of Cravit. On the earnings side, Daiichi expects to move into operating profit in F2004 as Cravit sales expand. It does not currently plan to expand its force of MRs much from 140-150, but expects to do so when urinary impediment treatment KMD-3213 (Phase 1 under preparation) is launched, which will be 2007 at the earliest.
*[[Tanabe]]: Markets in-house products such as hypertensive Herbesser and Tanatril. Tanabe does not disclose mediumterm targets, but plans to double the number of MRs to 200 by the end of 2005. No products are currently in clinical trials, but there are a number of development candidates.
*[[Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma]]: The China subsidiary Kuangchou Green Cross has been extending transfusion business (manufacturing, sales) since the days of the former [[Green Cross (Japan)|Green Cross]], but both sales and profits have been flat for the past several years. The firm has already sold off its transfusion business in Japan to Otsuka Pharmaceutical as part of its restructuring, and the strategic importance of this is diminishing. Anti-coagulant Novastan, which was approved and launched in China in December 2002, is being sold not via Kuangchou Green Cross but by a local agent.
*[[Astellas]]: Immunosuppressant Prograf is being marketed in China by an 80%-owned subsidiary An application has been filed to sell a second product, atopic dermatitis treatment Protopic. It has a relatively large number of MRs at 30-40 (the subsidiary has 60 employees); by comparison, Prograf has 40 MRs in the US. China business is less of a priority for Astellas than the US or Europe, but sees its potential as significant due to the large number of organ transplants. In 2000, there were 5,501 kidney transplants performed in China, second only to the number in the US (13,372). Sales of immunosuppressant drugs are relatively high. The top 30 drugs by sales in China (hospital market base) included two such drugs: Novartis’ Neoral at number 22 ($16.1 million), and Roche's CellCept at 23 ($15.8 million).
*[[Chugai]]: China is not positioned as a priority market for Chugai, which has focused on Europe since coming under the Roche group. Exports of white blood cell production stimulant Neutrogin account for most of its business in China, with marketing consigned to agents. Kirin's Gran, another GCSF drug, is marketed in China by Kirin itself and recorded 2002 sales of $11.1 million, ranking it 45th in the hospital market.
*[[Eisai]]: The firm expanded its own manufacturing and marketing operations into China and Asia earlier than in the European and US markets. Its sales and profits in F2002 and own projections for F2003 place Eisai as number one among Japanese firms in China. Eisai was the first manufacturer among the US, European and Japanese pharmaceutical firms to manufacture in China via a 100% owned subsidiary from the very beginning (founded in 1994). The sales target for 2006 is an ambitious ¥20 billion. By 2006, Eisai plans to increase the number of MRs from 150 to 250, and extend its coverage from 1,000 hospitals in 53 cities to 3,000 hospitals in 100 cities. It already sells two global products, anti-ulcer drug Pariet and Alzheimer's treatment Aricept, and plans to add osteoporosis drug Glakay in 2006.
*[[Kyowa Hakko]]: Having previously only exported cancer drugs (a few hundred million yen's worth), Kyowa Hakko plans to get approval and then start marketing itself thehypertensive Coniel at the end of 2004. Ant-allergy Allelock should also go on sale in 2007, with peak sales for the two combined projected by the firm at over ¥2 billion.
*[[Taisho (company)|Taisho]]: The company makes and sells health drinks (tonics) in China, but has no specific plans for prescription drugs. The rights to antibiotic Clarith/Biaxin outside Japan are licensed to Abbott.
*[[Terumo]]: Unlike the drug makers, Terumo is using China as a manufacturing base (almost all of its 1,362 employees there are in manufacturing). Its manufacturing subsidiary when set up in 1995 specialized in making products for the Japanese market, but more recently this has been producing and shipping products for the US and Europe as well. Terumo is still in the process of exploring China as a market, however. For more than 20 years, it has sold products using agents in China via its Hong Kong subsidiary, but F2002 sales amounted to only ¥1.3 billion (low-margin products are not handled, so there are profits). It plans to consider the possibility of in-house marketing, going forward.

=== Foreign companies doing R&amp;D in China ===
After China's entry into the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], many leading pharmaceutical companies are transferring their research and development centers to China. For instance, [[Roche Holding AG|Roche]] of Switzerland opened its R&amp;D center in Shanghai recently, [[GlaxoSmithKline|GSK]] has established its OTC research and development center in [[Tianjin]], China, and [[Pfizer]] and [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] ([[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]) will carry out similar plans in the near future. [[AstraZeneca]], [[Bayer]], [[Eli Lilly and Company]], and [[Hoffman-La Roche]], have also set up R&amp;D or [[clinical trial]] centers in China.

A poll on 33 foreign pharmaceutical enterprises in China shows that seven out of the 33 companies have R&amp;D centers in China, accounting for 22% of the surveyed. The remaining 26 pharmaceutical enterprises have no R&amp;D centers in China, accounting for 78% of the surveyed.  All the R&amp;D centers were founded after 1999, mainly in 2000 and 2001.

In January 2004, Roche of Switzerland opened its research and development center, the fifth R&amp;D center of the pharmaceutical giant, and the first to be established in China. Roche planned to hire 40 to 50 scientists in the first year and focus their research on [[pharmaceutical chemistry]] study. The center aims to step into [[traditional Chinese medicine]] research.

*[[Novo Nordisk]] has a $10 million research-and-development center at the Shangdi High-Technology Park in Beijing.
*[[Lonza Group|Lonza]] (Basel, Switzerland, www.lonza.com) has opened a facility in Guangzhou, China;
*[[Discovery Partners International]] (San Diego, CA, www.dpi, com) has affiliates in China.
*[[Chiral Quest]] has a research and development facility at a biotechnology R&amp;D park at Jiashan, China near Shanghai.
*[[Affymetrix]], Inc. and [[CapitalBio]] Corporation, a leading life science company based in Beijing, China formed a strategic relationship to jointly develop and co-market a proprietary, advanced GeneChip.

Foreign companies doing drug testing or clinical trials in China:
*[[SiniWest Holdings]]; Headquarters: San Diego; Product Tested in China: Drugs to treat breast cancer and peptic ulcers; Current Status: Did preliminary studies in China; plans U.S. research trial.
*[[Cancer Therapeutics]]; Headquarters: Los Angeles; Product Tested in China: Treatment involving antibodies that deliver radiation to kill cancer cells; Current Status: Expects approval in China this summer; approval in U.S. still three to four years away.
*[[FeRx]]; Headquarters: San Diego; Product Tested in China: Drug to treat liver cancer; Current Status: In research trials in both U.S. and China.
*[[Frontage Laboratories]]; Headquarters: Pennsylvania; Products Tested in China: Helping domestic firms to conduct IND enabling studies for new CNS, Cancer and Cardiovascular drugs with GLP operations in Shanghai, GMP operations in Beijing, and Clinical operations in Beijing and Zhengzhou (currently established 150 research beds in two centers); Current Status: In drug development experiments, preclinical and clinical trials in both US and China.

== Governmental policies ==
China's pharmaceutical industry has been a major industry that was completely directed by the state and subject to [[central planning]], upon which transition-era reforms since the 1980s to this day have had a major impact. The pharmaceutical industry has been shaken up following the implementation of several government-initiated structural reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reportinfo.asp?report_id=305197&amp;t=o&amp;cat_id=|title=Asian Animation, VFX &amp; Games Industry: Strategies, Trends &amp; Opportunities, 2018|first=Research and Markets|last=ltd|date=|website=www.researchandmarkets.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main reforms included:

1. Requiring all pharmaceutical manufacturers to meet GMP standards by 2004,

2. Diminishing drug sales through hospitals,

3. Bidding publicly for drug purchase,

4. Implementing a national healthcare insurance system, and

5. Strengthening intellectual property protection and SFDA supervision.

The overall goal has been to improve manufacturing and distribution efficiencies, strengthen drug safety supervision, and separate hospitals from the drug retailing business.

== Regulation ==
With the increasing growth of the Chinese pharmaceutical market, the government realised the importance of supervision of pharmaceutical market. They put forward several regulations and reform measures over the past couple of years, especially in the recent period of healthcare reform. The most influential issues for foreign companies are the decree of Administration Method of Import Pharmaceuticals recently promulgated by the State Drug Administration, and the launch of a new version of registration certificate for import pharmaceuticals. Despite these advances China is still the leading manufacturer of counterfeit drugs, which claim the lives of people worldwide every year. June 2009, Nigeria has seized a large consignment of fake anti-malarial drugs with the label of 'made in India' but found that the medicines were in fact produced in China and were imported into the African countries.[4] The authorities have maintained that the incident is not isolated, indicating that it was just the tip of the iceberg.

=== Regulatory agencies ===
*[[State Food and Drug Administration]]: As part of the government restructuring announced in March 1998, the Ministry of Health's Department of Drug Administration merged with the State Pharmaceutical Administration of China (SPAC) to become the State Drug Administration (SDA). As a result, SDA oversees all drug manufacturing, trade, and registration. In 2003, the SDA was restructured to become the State Food and Drug Administration.
Other former functions of the ministry have been assigned to different government bodies. The most important of these was the transfer of medical insurance responsibilities to the new Ministry of Labor and Social Security. Nonetheless, the Ministry of Health retains its other main functions-regulatory development and oversight, healthcare resource allocation, and medical research and education. 
The Chinese government's establishment of a single drug regulatory authority was an important step toward foreign access, because it eliminated the conflicting standards that prevailed among provincial government agencies, centralized the Chinese healthcare regulatory system, and made it more transparent. SFDA now oversees all medications-both Western and TCM-as well as advertising. Its new regulations follow FDA's model. 
Depending on the product and circumstance companies seeking to receive pharmaceutical approval might additionally have to register their product with the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine [[AQSIQ]].
In July 1999, as part of medical insurance reform, SFDA released its first list of over-the-counter (OTC) medications, and in 2000, the state began to regulate OTC and prescription drugs separately. SFDA did so to encourage patients to purchase OTC medicines for less serious diseases, thereby reducing government medication expenditures and hospital visits. 
The SFDA plans to cut the number of manufacturers down to around 2,000 over the next two years by attrition and by requiring remaining firms to meet the new GMP standards. In fact, SFDA required all pharmaceutical companies in China to obtain GMP certificates from SFDA by June 30, 2004 to be licensed to sell their drug products in China. About 3000 of the companies met the deadline; companies in the process of obtaining certification may subcontract secondary production to a certified company until June 30, 2005.

In 2005, SFDA launched a regulation on drug research and supervision management aimed at enforcing GLP to investigative drugs, traditional Chinese medicine injections and biotechnology products. The regulation aims to help China's drug research and development gain international recognition.

*[[National Development and Reform Commission]]: The function of the agency includes making strategic planning and mid to long term planning for the Chinese pharmaceutical industry,  regulating the prices of drugs, managing disaster relief funds and carrying out the pharmaceutical development projects sponsored by the government.
*Ministry of Commerce: The government organization regulates the import and export of medical devices and equipment, collects and analyzes import and export data, and carries out anti-dumping investigations.
*Ministry of Labor and Social Security: The agency is responsible for the management of state medical insurance systems.
*Ministry of Health: The agency guides the reform of the medical service industry, is responsible for clinical trials and clinical applications of drugs, joins with other agencies in monitoring the severe side effects of drugs, and makes the basic insurance drug list.
*State Traditional Chinese Medicine Administration: The agency focuses on policies and regulations related to traditional Chinese MEDICINES.
*State Population and Family Planning Commission: The agency writes the regulations on the use of birth control tools and pills.
*Ministry of Science and Technology: The agency determines new product development projects, evaluates and registers new research and development achievements; issues grants and funds for small to mid business innovative investment.
*State Quality Control Administration: It enacts and implements national standards.
*Industrial Associations: Include China OTC Association, China Pharmaceutical Quality Management Association, China Pharmaceutical Commerce Association, and others.

=== Regulatory requirements ===
China quickly advanced its pharmaceutical-related regulations around the time of its December 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO). China has strengthened [[patent]] protection: In conformity with the WTO/TRIPS agreement, the patent protection structure adopted by China approaches that of Japan, Europe, and the US. Since the end of the 1990s, the government has been striving to develop a healthcare insurance system that covers 200 million Chinese. Already, 90% of the population in major cities like Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou are covered, for a total of over 80 million. The Pharmaceutical Management Law was overhauled in December 2001, and various regulations were enacted from 2002-2003. Transparency in the approval process is gradually improving.

Following WTO regulations, China has committed itself to cutting [[tariff]]s, liberalizing its domestic distribution practices, and restructuring its regulatory environment. China has allowed foreign enterprises to import products and engage in distribution services. Furthermore, China has also implemented new drug administration laws designed to [[wikt:streamline|streamline]] product registration and protect [[Intellectual Property Rights]] (IPR). China has agreed to six years of "data exclusivity" and has committed itself to implementing a patent linkage system. The SFDA has worked to crack down on [[counterfeit]]ers but without greater resources and stricter legal consequences, these actions alone have yet to be enough to curb this rampant problem.

Since 1998, the government has raised the bar for entering the pharmaceutical business by passing laws including Drug Management Law and Regulations on Pharmaceutical Manufacturing. They involve following aspects of pharmaceutical manufacturing, drug distribution and selling, drug registration, requirements for manufacturing traditional Chinese medicines, medical packaging manufacturing requirements, and medical device manufacturing requirement.

The new laws will likely have an adverse effect on market growth and profitability during the transitional period, but over the next 5–10 years this market should be able to provide the returns.

=== Government drug pricing policy ===
In order to alleviate the burden of medical expenses on the society and ensure the implementation of the medical insurance scheme, retail prices of pharmaceutical products qualified for the program and included in the National Basic Medical Insurance Scheme Drug Catalogue will be regulated. The pricing mechanism is based upon three considerations when setting the maximum retail price - production cost, a wholesaler spread set by the government and the prices of comparable products in the market. Any products priced above this level will be cut.

=== Centralized tendering drug procurement program ===
The centralized tendering procurement system operates in two ways. First, several hospitals and medical institutions join together to invite tenders. Then, they appoint qualified agents to handle tenders. These agents are prohibited from having ties with the industry regulatory or administrative bodies.

In 2002, 70% of public hospitals at county or above level implemented this tendering system. This system has successfully passed the pilot phase and proven effective. Both the number of participating hospitals and variety of drugs expanded substantially.

More power to hospitals and medical institutions. In a market economy, hospitals and medical institutions do their own drug procurement. They source drugs from manufacturers at market prices and dispense them to patients. The centralized tendering drug procurement system, however, gives more power to hospitals in drug procurement. As a result, some unfair, unjustified and unreasonable practices surface as decision makers of some hospitals abused their power in order to get economic benefits.

=== GMP compliance certification ===
GMP is a system to ensure products are consistently produced and controlled according to quality standards. It is designed to minimize the risks involved in any pharmaceutical production that cannot be eliminated through testing the final product. A directive circular issued by the Ministry of Health in Jul 95 marked the official launch of GMP certification in China. The China Certification Committee for Drugs (CCCD) was established in the same year. A subsidiary organization was also set up to manage the certification program.

Currently nine government agencies are the key agencies responsible for regulation. They are the State Food and Pharmaceutical Administration (SFDA), the State Development and Reform Committee, the Commerce Ministry, the State Traditional Chinese Medicine Administration, the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, the Ministry of Health, the State Population and Family Planning Committee, the Ministry of Science and Technology, and the State Quality and Technology Supervision Administration.

In addition, more than 10 industrial associations also regulate the industry.

===Comparison of regulatory requirements with other countries===

The enforcement of Good Manufacturing Practices has not been adequate in China and the U.S. FDA and EMA (European Medicines Agency) have inspected Chinese pharmaceutical plants that export to their countries and found many to be seriously non compliant with GMP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/iceci/enforcementactions/WarningLetters/default.htm|title=Warning Letters|website=www.fda.gov|accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/industrygroup_6.html|title=Import Alert Industry Group Human Drug|website=www.accessdata.fda.gov|accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There should be no big differences between rules of China and those of the U.S. Pharmaceutical, partly because China is following and copying U.S. rules. Chinese regulations affect nearly every aspect of drug manufacturing, from the design and construction of manufacturing facilities to the development of procedures and the training of operations personnel performing them.

There is only federal regulation on new drug application, but there are both local regulation and national regulation regarding pharma expenditures of hospitals, reimbursable drug lists, and other issues. National regulation is implemented by SFDA and other state agencies, while local regulation is implemented by provincial agencies.

Through related laws, China has established a physician licensing system, which requires physicians to pass a national exam to be eligible for applying for licenses. After passing the exam, physicians will be eligible for applying for certificates for the practice of medicine. Licensed physicians can open their own clinics five years after getting licenses, during which they must work as physicians.

There is a mechanism for approving new drugs (from NDA filing to approval). A full three-phase research trial takes three to five years, similar to the U.S., while requirements to start a trial are onerous by foreign standards, according to Western drug-company executives.

Although the approval time is being shortened, there still remain many aspects where transparency is lacking.

=== Patents ===
Western pharmaceutical companies have applied for numerous [[patents]] in China. About 10,000 patents for traditional Chinese medicines belong to Western companies. However, some Western observers say China lacks administrative protection for patents.
 
In 1992, the United States and China signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to allow administrative protection (AP) in China for US pharmaceutical patents granted between 1986 and 1992. The MOU provided seven-and-a-half years of market exclusivity, or AP rights, in China for pharma patents that were: not protected by exclusive rights before the amendment of current Chinese laws; patent protected after 1 January 1986 and before 1 January 1993 in an MOU signatory country; not previously marketed in China. Several Chinese government policies have prevented US industry from realizing the intended MOU benefits. According to Article 42 of the Patent Law, the duration of patent right for inventions is twenty years, and the duration for utility models and patent right for designs is ten years, counted from the date of filing.

The [[State Intellectual Property Office]] is responsible for enforcing patents. The intellectual property system in China was originated from and developed as a result of the policy of reform and opening-up. The State Council, the Patent Office of China, the predecessor of SIPO, was founded in 1980 to protect intellectual property, encourage invention and creation, help popularize inventions and their exploitation, and promote the progress and innovation in science and technology.

In 1998, with the restructuring of the government agencies, the Patent Office of China was renamed SIPO and became a government institution under the direct under control of the State Council. The office is in charge of patent affairs and deals with foreign-related intellectual property issues.

=== United States and China ===
As a member of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], China is active in protecting international patents. The SIPO has signed intellectual property protection memorandums with countries including Russia and Thailand on the protection of intellectual properties. Such agreements are necessary to protect international patents in China.

On July 14, 2005, China and the United States reached an agreement on intellectual property protection.  According to western pharmaceutical business journals, most discouraging to US pharmaceutical companies has been the rampant theft of their intellectual property through patent infringement and counterfeiting. All those factors undermined the competitive advantage that innovative pharmaceutical companies stood to gain from marketing investments. As a result, US companies accounted for less than 10 percent of China's total pharmaceutical imports between 1998 and 2000.

China has more recently agreed to implement the Trade Related Intellectual Property Agreement of the Uruguay Round. To comply, Chinese companies will have to change their long-time practice of relying on counterfeit products. According to China's Securities Times, foreign companies will be able to file compensation claims ranging from $400 million to $1 billion against companies that copy patented medicines.

=== Articles 18 and 19 ===
Chinese patent law addresses foreign companies in articles 18 and 19.  Under Article 18, where any foreigner, foreign enterprise or other foreign organization having no habitual residence or business office in China files an application for a patent in China, the application is treated in accordance with any agreement between the organization's host country and China, or any international treaty to which both countries are party, or on the basis of the principle of reciprocity.

Under Article 19, where such an organization applies for a patent, or has other patent matters to attend to in China, it must appoint a patent agency designated by the patent administration department under the State Council to act as his or its agent.

The patent agency is mandated to comply with the laws and administrative regulations, and to handle patent applications and other patent matters according to the instructions of its clients. The agency bears the responsibility of keeping the contents of its clients' inventions-creations confidential. The administrative regulations governing the patent agency are formulated by the State Council.&lt;ref&gt;Sources: SFDA, China Pharmaceutical Industry Report 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution ==
The Chinese pharmaceutical distribution sector is very fragmented with about 10,000+ state-owned pharmaceutical wholesalers. Direct marketing to doctors (detailing), which is the basic marketing activity in developed countries, complemented by advertising, is not developed in China. Chinese hospitals generate 60 percent of their revenues from the sale of [[prescription drug]]s. Hospital pharmacies are still the main retail outlets for pharmaceuticals, accounting for 80 percent of total drug sales. This situation is changing because the government is encouraging the establishment of retail pharmacies that are not associated with hospitals.

Drugs are distributed in China through the Chinese-style channels. China has a three tiered distribution system. At the top of the ladder are national ''level-1'' stations in [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Shenyang]], [[Guangzhou]], and [[Tianjin]]. These allocate products to provincial ''level-2'' distributors, who in turn sell to county and city ''level-3'' wholesaler-drug stores. At the bottom of the distribution chain are China's vast numbers of small retail stores are difficult to reach individually.

==Pharmaceutical Logistics==
At present, China's [[pharmaceutical logistics]] industry is featured as small-scale, scattered investment and fierce [[competition]]. China's pharmaceutical logistics industry is mainly composed of pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceutical distributors. China has 16,500 wholesalers, 120,000 retailers and more than 6,300 producers. In terms of sales, China's top three companies: [[Sinopharm Group]], [[Shanghai Pharmaceutical Co.]] and [[Jiuzhoutong Group Corp.]], are all shared less than 5% of the national market.

Since 2002, China's pharmaceutical logistics industry has been expanding constantly. A great amount of capital is being poured into the industry. In 2007, China had three pharmaceutical logistics centers put into operation, namely, [[Jiangsu Yabang Medicine Logistics Center]], [[Quanzhou Medicine &amp; Food Logistics Port]] and [[Chongqing Medicine Heping Logistics Center]].

Large pharmaceutical logistics projects that initiated the construction in 2007 include the China-ASEAN (Tongji) Medicine Logistics Center invested by Guangxi Tongji Medicine Group with CNY145 million, the Nantong Suzhong Pharmaceutical Logistics Center with a total investment of CNY280 million, and the Chongqing Modern Medicine Logistics Center Project jointly invested by Shenzhen Neptunus Bioengineering Co., Jinguan Group and Chongqing Huabo Medicine Co.

Based on the statistics from the [[China Association of Pharmaceutical Commerce]] and [[China's Medicine and Healthcare Product Import and Export Association]], in view of the features of China's pharmaceutical logistics industry, China demands urgently to create a group of large trans-region, trans-industry and trans-ownership Pharmaceutical logistics conglomerates through restructuring the industry and forming an alliance. As for the construction of logistics centers, it is better to build them jointly. In this way, it will help carry out management on the entire logistics operation to speed up the flow of drugs, improve circulation efficiency and reduce logistics cost.

== End users ==
There are two types of end users for in China: [[hospital]]s and [[retail]] pharmaceutical [[franchising]] stores. According to a 2004 sample investigation of hospitals in 16 cities, it was estimated that Chinese hospitals purchased a combined total of U$2.5 billion in drugs, an increase of 27% over 2003. The total revenue from pharmaceutical franchising stores was US$5.6 billion in 2004, an increase of 36% over 2003.

== Retail operations ==
Due to China's former planned economy system, hospitals are still the main distributors of pharmaceuticals. In 2003, only 15.1% of total drug expeditures were incurred at [[pharmacy]] stores.(Meng 2005) The Chinese government legalized foreign ownership of retail pharmacies in 2003. Corporations such as [[Alliance Boots]] have formed retail and distribution joint ventures in China, mainly focused on [[Guangdong]] province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allianceboots.com/main.asp?nid=400&amp;pid=1494 Alliance Boots to enter Chinese pharmaceutical market through joint venture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012052957/http://www.allianceboots.com/main.asp?nid=400&amp;pid=1494 |date=12 October 2007 }} 29 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Many companies have said that the drug distribution system in China is inefficient and adds considerably to the retail costs of medicine. Also there have been complaints of unclear regulations, low profitability, complex licensing procedure, hospital bidding, and reimbursement schemes.

== Dietary supplements ==
The [[dietary supplement]]s sub-sector has doubled from $3 billion in 1998 to a total sales volume of $6 billion in 2001. Experts estimate that the industry will reach $10 billion in annual sales by 2010, and will continue as consumers seek products with curative weight loss and other health enhancing effects. Over 3,000 domestic manufacturers of dietary supplements produce more than 4,000 different types of products. Domestic manufacturers fail to develop product branding and credibility and rely heavily on advertising to generate sales. As such, most domestic products, due to loss of credibility amongst consumers, tend to have short [[Product lifecycle (marketing)|life cycle]]s. High quality imported products only account for 10% of total sales. Companies say that complicated product registration, expensive and time-consuming certification requirements, and inexperienced and inefficient distributors are common obstacles.

The '''phases of clinical research''' are the steps in which scientists do experiments with a [[health intervention]] in an attempt to find enough evidence for a process which would be useful as a [[medical treatment]]. In the case of pharmaceutical study, the phases start with [[drug design]] and [[drug discovery]] then proceed on to [[animal testing]]. If this is successful, they begin the clinical phase of development by testing for safety in a few [[Human subject research|human subjects]] and expand to test in many study participants to determine if the treatment is effective.

==Summary==
Clinical trials involving new drugs are commonly classified into four phases. Individual trials may encompass more than one phase. A common example of this is combined phase I/II or phase II/III trials. Therefore, it may be easier to think of early phase studies and late phase studies.&lt;ref name="DeMets" /&gt;  The drug-development process will normally proceed through all four phases over many years. If the drug successfully passes through Phases I, II, and III, it will usually be approved by the national regulatory authority for use in the general population. Phase IV are 'post-approval' studies.

==Pre-clinical studies==
Before pharmaceutical companies start clinical trials on a drug, they conduct extensive [[pre-clinical development|pre-clinical studies]]. These involve [[in vitro]] (test tube or cell culture) and [[in vivo]] (animal) experiments using wide-ranging doses of the study drug to obtain preliminary [[efficacy]], [[toxicity]] and [[pharmacokinetic]] information. Such tests assist pharmaceutical companies to decide whether a drug candidate has scientific merit for further development as an [[investigational new drug]].

==Phase 0==
Phase 0 is a recent designation for optional exploratory trials conducted in accordance with the United States [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration's]] (FDA) 2006 Guidance on Exploratory [[Investigational New Drug]] (IND) Studies.&lt;ref name=cder2006&gt;{{cite web
 |author=[[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research|CDER]] |date=January 2006 |title=Exploratory IND Studies |series=Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and Reviewers |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |doi= |pmid= |pmc= |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm078933.pdf |accessdate=2010-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase 0 trials are also known as human [[microdosing]] studies and are designed to speed up the development of promising drugs or [[Contrast medium|imaging agent]]s by establishing very early on whether the drug or agent behaves in human subjects as was expected from preclinical studies. Distinctive features of Phase 0 trials include the administration of single subtherapeutic doses of the study drug to a small number of subjects (10 to 15) to gather preliminary data on the agent's  [[pharmacokinetics]] (what the body does to the drugs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Phase 0 trials: a platform for drug development?|journal=Lancet|volume=374|issue=9685|page=176|year=2009|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61309-X|last1=The Lancet|pmid=19616703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Phase 0 study gives no data on safety or efficacy, being by definition a dose too low to cause any therapeutic effect. Drug development companies carry out Phase 0 studies to rank drug candidates in order to decide which has the best [[pharmacokinetic]] parameters in humans to take forward into further development. They enable go/no-go decisions to be based on relevant human models instead of relying on sometimes inconsistent animal data.

==Phase I==
Phase I trials were formerly referred to as “first-in-man studies” but the field generally moved to the [[gender-neutral language]] phrase "first-in-humans" in the 1990s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fisher|first1=JA|title=Feeding and Bleeding: The Institutional Banalization of Risk to Healthy Volunteers in Phase I Pharmaceutical Clinical Trials.|journal=Science, technology &amp; human values|date=1 March 2015|volume=40|issue=2|pages=199–226|doi=10.1177/0162243914554838|pmid=25914430|pmc=4405793}}&lt;/ref&gt; these trials are the first stage of testing in human subjects.&lt;ref name="ccs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/diagnosis-and-treatment/clinical-trials/phases-of-clinical-trials/?region=on|title=Phases of clinical trials|publisher=Canadian Cancer Society|date=2017|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are designed to test the safety, side effects, best dose, and formulation method for the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/phase-i-clinical-trial | title = NCI Dictionary | publisher = National Cancer Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally, a small group of 2–100 healthy volunteers will be recruited.&lt;ref name=fda/&gt;&lt;ref name=ccs/&gt; These trials are often conducted in a clinical trial clinic, where the subject can be observed by full-time staff. These clinical trial clinics are often run by [[contract research organization]] (CROs) who conduct these studies on behalf of [[pharmaceutical companies]] or other research investigators. The subject who receives the drug is usually observed until several [[Biological half-life|half-lives]] of the drug have passed. This phase is designed to assess the safety ([[pharmacovigilance]]), tolerability, [[pharmacokinetics]], and [[pharmacodynamics]] of a drug. Phase I trials normally include [[dose-ranging]], also called dose escalation studies, so that the best and safest dose can be found and to discover the point at which a compound is too poisonous to administer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/582554_2 | title = The Myth of Equipoise in Phase 1 Clinical Trials | journal = Medscape J Med | year = 2008 | volume = 10 | issue = 11 | pages = 254 | author = Adil E. Shamoo | pmid = 19099004 | pmc = 2605120 }}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tested range of doses will usually be a fraction{{quantify|date=November 2011}} of the dose that caused harm in [[animal testing]]. Phase I trials most often include healthy volunteers. However, there are some circumstances when clinical patients are used, such as patients who have [[terminal illness|terminal]] cancer or [[HIV]] and the treatment is likely to make healthy individuals ill. These studies are usually conducted in tightly controlled clinics called CPUs (Central Pharmacological Units), where participants receive 24-hour medical attention and oversight. In addition to the previously mentioned unhealthy individuals, “patients who have typically already tried and failed to improve on the existing standard therapies"&lt;ref name="DeMets"&gt;{{Cite book | author = DeMets, D., Friedman, L., and Furberg, C. | year = 2010 | title = Fundamentals of Clinical Trials | publisher = Springer | edition = 4th | isbn = 978-1-4419-1585-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; may also participate in phase I trials.  Volunteers are paid a variable inconvenience fee for their time spent in the volunteer center.

Before beginning a phase I trial, the sponsor must submit an [[Investigational New Drug]] application to the FDA detailing the preliminary data on the drug gathered from cellular models and animal studies.

Phase I trials can be further divided:

;Single ascending dose (Phase Ia): In single ascending dose studies, small groups of subjects are given a single dose of the drug while they are observed and tested for a period of time to confirm safety.&lt;ref name=ccs/&gt;&lt;ref name="p1ct"&gt;Elizabeth Norfleet, Shayne Cox Gad, "Phase I Clinical Trials", in Shayne Cox Gad, ''Clinical Trials Handbook'', {{ISBN|978-0-470-46635-3}}, 2009, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, a small number of participants, usually three, are entered sequentially at a particular dose.&lt;ref name="DeMets" /&gt;  If they do not exhibit any [[adverse event|adverse]] side effects, and the pharmacokinetic data are roughly in line with predicted safe values, the dose is escalated, and a new group of subjects is then given a higher dose.  If unacceptable toxicity is observed in any of the three participants, an additional number of participants, usually three, are treated at the same dose.&lt;ref name="DeMets" /&gt;  This is continued until pre-calculated pharmacokinetic safety levels are reached, or intolerable side effects start showing up (at which point the drug is said to have reached the [[maximum tolerated dose]] (MTD)).  If an additional unacceptable toxicity is observed, then the dose escalation is terminated and that dose, or perhaps the previous dose, is declared to be the maximally tolerated dose.  This particular design assumes that the maximally tolerated dose occurs when approximately one-third of the participants experience unacceptable toxicity.  Variations of this design exist, but most are similar.&lt;ref name="DeMets" /&gt;

;Multiple ascending dose (Phase Ib): Multiple ascending dose studies investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of multiple doses of the drug, looking at safety and tolerability. In these studies, a group of patients receives multiple low doses of the drug, while samples (of blood, and other fluids) are collected at various time points and analyzed to acquire information on how the drug is processed within the body. The dose is subsequently escalated for further groups, up to a predetermined level.&lt;ref name=ccs/&gt;&lt;ref name="p1ct"/&gt;

;Food effect: A short trial designed to investigate any differences in absorption of the drug by the body, caused by eating before the drug is given. These studies are usually run as a [[crossover study]], with volunteers being given two identical doses of the drug while [[Fasting|fasted]], and after being fed.

==Phase II==
Once a dose or range of doses is determined, the next goal is to evaluate whether the drug has any biological activity or effect.&lt;ref name="DeMets" /&gt;  Phase II trials are performed on larger groups (100–300) and are designed to assess how well the drug works, as well as to continue Phase I safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers and patients.  Genetic testing is common, particularly when there is evidence of variation in metabolic rate.&lt;ref name="DeMets" /&gt;  When the development process for a new drug fails, this usually occurs during Phase II trials when the drug is discovered not to work as planned, or to have toxic effects.

Phase II studies are sometimes divided into Phase IIA and Phase IIB. There is no formal definition for these 2 sub-categories, but generally:
* Phase IIA studies are usually pilot studies designed to demonstrate clinical efficacy or biological activity ('proof of concept' studies);
* Phase IIB studies look to find the optimum dose at which the drug shows biological activity with minimal side-effects (‘definite dose-finding’ studies).

Some trials combine Phase I and Phase II, and test both efficacy and toxicity.

;Trial design: Some Phase II trials are designed as [[case series]], demonstrating a drug's safety and activity in a selected group of patients. Other Phase II trials are designed as [[randomized controlled trial]]s, where some patients receive the drug/device and others receive placebo/standard treatment. Randomized Phase II trials have far fewer patients than randomized Phase III trials.

;Example Cancer Design: In the first stage, the investigator attempts to rule out drugs which have no or little biologic activity.  For example, the researcher may specify that a drug must have some minimal level of activity, say, in 20% of participants.  If the estimated activity level is less than 20%, the researcher chooses not to consider this drug further, at least not at that maximally tolerated dose.  If the estimated activity level exceeds 20%, the researcher will add more participants to get a better estimate of the response rate.  A typical study for ruling out a 20% or lower response rate enters 14 participants.  If no response is observed in the first 14 participants, the drug is considered not likely to have a 20% or higher activity level.  The number of additional participants added depends on the degree of precision desired, but ranges from 10 to 20.  Thus, a typical cancer phase II study might include fewer than 30 people to estimate the response rate.&lt;ref name="DeMets" /&gt;

;Efficacy vs Effectiveness: When a study assesses efficacy, it is looking at whether the drug given in the specific manner described in the study is able to influence an outcome of interest (e.g. tumor size) in the chosen population (e.g. cancer patients with no other ongoing diseases). When a study is assessing effectiveness, it is determining whether a treatment will influence the disease. In an effectiveness study it is essential that patients are treated as they would be when the treatment is prescribed in actual practice. That would mean that there should be no aspects of the study designed to increase patient compliance above those that would occur in routine clinical practice. The outcomes in effectiveness studies are also more generally applicable than in most efficacy studies (for example does the patient feel better, come to the hospital less or live longer in effectiveness studies as opposed to better test scores or lower cell counts in efficacy studies). There is usually less rigid control of the type of patient to be included in effectiveness studies than in efficacy studies, as the researchers are interested in whether the drug will have a broad effect in the population of patients with the disease.

Some researchers argue that phase II studies are generally smaller than they ought to be.&lt;ref name="DeMets" /&gt;

===Success rate===

Phase II clinical programs historically have experienced the lowest success rate of the four development phases.  In 2010, the percentage of phase II trials that proceeded to phase III was 18%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medcitynews.com/2011/06/new-drug-failure-rates-rising-in-phase-ii-and-iii-clinical-trials/|title=New drugs failing Phase II and III clinical trials|publisher=MedCity News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and only 30.7% of developmental candidates advanced from Phase II to Phase III in a large study of trials from 2006-2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bio.org/sites/default/files/Clinical%20Development%20Success%20Rates%202006-2015%20-%20BIO,%20Biomedtracker,%20Amplion%202016.pdf|title=Clinical Development Success Rates 2006-2015|last=|first=|date=|website=bio.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phase III==
This phase is designed to assess the effectiveness of the new intervention and, thereby, its value in clinical practice.&lt;ref name="DeMets" /&gt;  Phase III studies are randomized controlled [[multicenter trial]]s on large patient groups (300–3,000 or more depending upon the disease/medical condition studied) and are aimed at being the definitive assessment of how effective the drug is, in comparison with current 'gold standard' treatment. Because of their size and comparatively long duration, Phase III trials are the most expensive, time-consuming and difficult trials to design and run, especially in therapies for [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] medical conditions. Phase III trials of chronic conditions or diseases often have a short follow-up period for evaluation, relative to the period of time the intervention might be used in practice.&lt;ref name="DeMets" /&gt;  This is sometimes called the "pre-marketing phase" because it actually measures consumer response to the drug.

It is common practice that certain Phase III trials will continue while the regulatory submission is pending at the appropriate regulatory agency. This allows patients to continue to receive possibly lifesaving drugs until the drug can be obtained by purchase. Other reasons for performing trials at this stage include attempts by the sponsor at "label expansion" (to show the drug works for additional types of patients/diseases beyond the original use for which the drug was approved for marketing), to obtain additional safety data, or to support marketing claims for the drug. Studies in this phase are by some companies categorized as "Phase IIIB studies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/drugsbiologics.html|title=Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators|accessdate=2007-03-27|date=1999-03-16|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not required in all cases, it is typically expected that there be at least two successful Phase III trials, demonstrating a drug's safety and efficacy, in order to obtain approval from the appropriate regulatory agencies such as [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] (USA), or the [[European Medicines Agency|EMA]] (European Union).

Once a drug has proved satisfactory after Phase III trials, the trial results are usually combined into a large document containing a comprehensive description of the methods and results of human and animal studies, manufacturing procedures, formulation details, and shelf life. This collection of information makes up the "regulatory submission" that is provided for review to the appropriate regulatory authorities&lt;ref name="reg-auth"&gt;The regulatory authority in the USA is the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]]; in Canada, [[Health Canada]]; in the [[European Union]], the [[European Medicines Agency]]; and in Japan, the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]]&lt;/ref&gt; in different countries. They will review the submission, and, it is hoped, give the sponsor approval to market the drug.

Most drugs undergoing Phase III clinical trials can be marketed under FDA norms with proper recommendations and guidelines through a [[New Drug Application]] (NDA) containing all manufacturing, pre-clinical, and clinical data. In case of any adverse effects being reported anywhere, the drugs need to be recalled immediately from the market.  While most pharmaceutical companies refrain from this practice, it is not abnormal to see many drugs undergoing Phase III clinical trials in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pharmacotherapeutics for Advanced Practice: A Practical Approach |last=Arcangelo |first=Virginia Poole |author2=Andrew M. Peterson |year=2005 |publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]] |isbn=0-7817-5784-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Success rate===

As of 2010, about 50% of drug candidates either fail during the Phase III trial or are rejected by the national regulatory agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v10/n2/full/nrd3375.html|title=Trial watch: Phase III and submission failures: 2007–2010|first=John|last=Arrowsmith|date=1 February 2011|publisher=|journal=Nat Rev Drug Discov|volume=10|issue=2|pages=87–87|via=www.nature.com|doi=10.1038/nrd3375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phase II/III cost'''

The amount of money spent on Phase II/III trials depends on numerous factors, with therapeutic area being studied and types of clinical procedures as key drivers; Phase II studies may cost as much as $20 million, and Phase III as much as $53 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=26908540|year=2016|author1=Sertkaya|first1=A|title=Key cost drivers of pharmaceutical clinical trials in the United States|journal=Clinical Trials|volume=13|issue=2|pages=117–26|last2=Wong|first2=H.

==Phase IV==
A Phase IV trial is also known as [[postmarketing surveillance]] trial, or informally as a [[confirmatory trial]]. Phase IV trials involve the safety surveillance ([[pharmacovigilance]]) and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives permission to be sold (e.g. after approval under the [[FDA Accelerated Approval Program]]).&lt;ref name="acs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/clinical-trials/what-you-need-to-know/phases-of-clinical-trials.html|title=What Are the Phases of Clinical Trials?|publisher=American Cancer Society|date=2017|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase IV studies may be required by regulatory authorities or may be undertaken by the sponsoring company for competitive (finding a new market for the drug) or other reasons (for example, the drug may not have been tested for interactions with other drugs, or on certain population groups such as pregnant women, who are unlikely to subject themselves to trials).&lt;ref name=fda/&gt;&lt;ref name=ccs/&gt; The safety surveillance is designed to detect any rare or long-term adverse effects over a much larger patient population and longer time period than was possible during the Phase I-III clinical trials.&lt;ref name=ccs/&gt;&lt;ref name=acs/&gt; Harmful effects discovered by Phase IV trials may result in a drug being no longer sold, or restricted to certain uses; recent examples involve [[cerivastatin]] (brand names Baycol and Lipobay), [[troglitazone]] (Rezulin) and [[rofecoxib]] (Vioxx). The minimum time period mandatory for Phase IV clinical trials is 2 years.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Overall cost==
The entire process of developing a drug from preclinical research to marketing can take approximately 12 to 18 years and often costs well over $1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.5912/jcb588 | title = Fixing a broken drug development process | year = 2013 | last1 = Holland | first1 = John | journal = Journal of Commercial Biotechnology | volume = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.25.2.420 | title = Estimating the Cost of New Drug Development: Is It Really $802 Million? | year = 2006 | last1 = Adams | first1 = C.

'''Purpura fulminans''' is an acute, often fatal, thrombotic disorder which manifests as blood spots, bruising and discolouration of the skin resulting from [[coagulation]] in small blood vessels within the [[skin]] and rapidly leads to [[necrosis|skin necrosis]] and [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]].&lt;ref name="Chalmers2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chalmers E, Cooper P, Forman K, Grimley C, Khair K, Minford A, Morgan M, Mumford AD |title=Purpura fulminans: recognition, diagnosis and management |journal=Arch Dis Child |volume=96 |issue=11 |pages=1066–1071 |year=2011 |pmid=21233082 |doi=10.1136/adc.2010.199919}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghosh2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ghosh SK, Bandyopadhyay D, Dutta A |title=Purpura fulminans: a cutaneous marker of disseminated intravascular coagulation |journal=West J Emerg Med |volume=10 |issue=1|pages=41 |year=2009 |pmid=19561767 |pmc=2672288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
{{Main|Protein C deficiency}}
Purpura fulminans is caused by defects in the [[protein C]] anticoagulant pathway. Identification of the cause of purpura fulminans often depends on the patient’s age and circumstances of presentation.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2011/&gt;

===Congenital protein C deficiency===
[[Congenital]] (inherited) defects in protein C activity are autosomal dominant and may be partial or severe loss of function.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="Estelles1984"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Estelles A, Garcia-Plaza I, Dasi A, Aznar J, Duart M, Sanz G, Perez-Requejo JL, Espana F, Jimenez C, Abeledo G |title=Severe inherited "homozygous" protein C deficiency in a newborn infant |journal=Thromb Haemost |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=53–56 |year=1984 |pmid=6548587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of natural [[mutations]] of the protein C gene (PROC) have been identified.&lt;ref name="D’Ursi2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=D'Ursi P, Marino F, Caprera A, Milanesi L, Faioni EM, Rovida E |title=ProCMD: a database and 3D web resource for protein C mutants |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=8 |issue=Suppl 1|pages=S11 |year=2007 |pmid=17430555 |pmc=1885840 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-8-s1-s11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ursitti"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ursitti JA, Petrich BG, Lee PC, Resneck WG, Ye X, Yang J, Randall WR, Bloch RJ, Wang Y |title=Role of an alternatively spliced form of alphaII-spectrin in localization of connexin 43 in cardiomyocytes and regulation by stress-activated protein kinase |journal=J Mol Cell Cardiol |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=572–581 |year=2007 |pmid=17276456 |pmc=1983066 |doi=10.1016/j.yjmcc.2006.11.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquired protein C deficiency===
Acquired protein C deficiency is caused by either depletion of available protein C in plasma or decreased protein C synthesis (caused by administration of [[vitamin K antagonist]]s, severe [[liver failure]] or complications of prematurity).&lt;ref name="Goldenberg2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goldenberg NA, Manco-Johnson MJ |title=Protein C deficiency |journal=Haemophilia |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=1214–1221 |year=2008 |pmid=19141162 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2516.2008.01838.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Severe acute sepsis===
Purpura fulminans is a presenting feature of severe acute sepsis, such as [[Neisseria meningitidis]], [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]], Group A and B [[Streptococci]], and less commonly with [[Haemophilus influenzae]], [[Staphylococcus aureus]], or [[Plasmodium falciparum]] (malaria) infections, particularly in individuals with [[asplenia]].&lt;ref name=Chalmers2011/&gt;

===Combination of sepsis and partial congenital defect===
In some cases, a combination of sepsis and a partial congenital defect in the protein C anticoagulant pathway initiates purpura fluminans.&lt;ref name="Gurgey"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gurgey A. |title=Clinical manifestations in thrombotic children with factor V Leiden mutation |journal=Pediatr Hematol Oncol |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=233–237 |year=1999 |pmid=10326221 |doi=10.1080/088800199277281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unknown===
In rare instances, purpura fulminans is an autoimmune manifestation against protein C or [[protein S]] after normally benign infections, such as [[chicken pox]].&lt;ref name=Chalmers2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levin1995"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Levin M, Eley BS, Louis J, Cohen H, Young L, Heyderman RS |title= Postinfectious purpura fulminans caused by an autoantibody directed against protein S |journal=J Pediatr |volume=127 |issue=3 |pages=355–63|year=1995 |pmid=7658262 |doi=10.1016/s0022-3476(95)70063-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes purpura fulminans has unknown cause.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2011/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
Regardless of the underlying cause of purpura fulminans, the mechanism of disease is similar with deficiency in protein C concentration or decrease in protein C activity which promotes blood clotting ([[thrombosis]]).&lt;ref name="Adcock1990"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Adcock DM, Brozna J, Marlar RA |title=Proposed classification and pathologic mechanisms of purpura fulminans and skin necrosis|journal=Semin Thromb Hemost |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=333–340 |year=1990 |pmid=2281322 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-1002686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of severe sepsis, there is widespread activation of the acute systemic [[inflammatory response]], including activation of the [[coagulation]] and [[Complement system|complement]] pathways, as well as [[endothelial dysfunction]]. Activated protein C helps regulate the systemic inflammatory response. During sepsis, signalling by the inflammatory [[cytokines]], [[interleukin-1]] and [[tumour necrosis factor]], mediate altered [[protein transcription]] in the systemic inflammatory response, resulting in decreased synthesis of the regulatory proteins [[antithrombin]], protein C and protein S, with increased synthesis of prothrombotic proteins [[Factor VIII]], [[von Willebrand factor]], and [[fibrinogen]]. Activated protein C binds to endothelial protein C receptor and subsequently cleaves the endothelial cell protease activated receptor-1, not only altering coagulation profiles but down-regulating pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic mediators, up-regulation of anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic pathways and stabilization of the endothelial cell barrier functions.&lt;ref name="Mosnier2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mosnier LO, Zlokovic BV, Griffin JH |title=The cytoprotective protein C pathway |journal=Blood |volume=109 |issue=8 |pages=3161–3172 |year=2007 |pmid=17110453 |doi=10.1182/blood-2006-09-003004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systemic coagulation activation may lead to depletion of circulating coagulation factors and [[platelets]], which subsequently lead to bleeding.&lt;ref name="Kondaveeti1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kondaveeti S, Hibberd ML, Booy R, Nadel S, Levin M |title=Effect of the Factor V Leiden mutation on the severity of meningococcal disease |journal=Pediatr Infect Dis J |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=893–896 |year=1999 |pmid=10530586 |doi=10.1097/00006454-199910000-00011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early purpura fulminans, lesion progression correlates with the histological appearance of blockage of small skin blood vessels with blood clots causing [[capillary]] dilation and congestion with red blood cells. In later stage lesions, there is irreversible endothelial [[ischaemic]] injury with [[extravasation]] of blood cells into the dermis and gangrenous necrosis, sometimes with secondary infection.&lt;ref name="Adcock1990a"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Adcock DM, Hicks MJ |title=Dermatopathology of skin necrosis associated with purpura fulminans |journal=Semin Thromb Hemost |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=283–292 |year=1990 |pmid=2281318 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-1002681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The depletion of anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory proteins, in particular, protein C and its co-factor, [[protein S]], may also promote [[thrombus]] formation, inhibit fibrinolysis and lead to further activation of the inflammatory pathways.&lt;ref name="Fourrier1990"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fourrier F, Lestavel P, Chopin C, Marey A, Goudemand J, Rime A, Mangalaboyi J |title=Meningococcemia and purpura fulminans in adults: acute deficiencies of proteins C and S and early treatment with antithrombin III concentrates |journal=Intensive Care Med |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=121–124 |year=1990 |pmid=2139671 |doi=10.1007/bf01699858}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paramo1990"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paramo JA, Perez JL, Serrano M, Rocha E |title=Types 1 and 2 plasminogen activator inhibitor and tumor necrosis factor alpha in patients with sepsis |journal=Thromb Haemost |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=3–6 |year=1990 |pmid=2274926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Early purpura fulminans lesions look similar to traumatic skin bleeds or [[purpuric]] rashes, such as immune [[thrombocytopenic]] purpura or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; however, purpura fulminans will rapidly progress to necrosis whereas other purpuric rashes do not.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2011/&gt; In most cases, differential diagnoses may be distinguished from purpura fulminans by other clinical and laboratory findings.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2011/&gt;

The initial appearance of purpura fulminans lesions is of well-demarcated erythematous [[lesions]] which progress rapidly to develop irregular central areas of blue-black haemorrhagic necrosis.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2011/&gt; Advancing areas of necrosis are often surrounded by a thin border of [[erythema]] that fades into adjacent unaffected skin. [[Haemorrhage]] into the necrotic skin causes purpura fulminans lesions to become painful, dark and raised, sometimes with [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]] or blister (bulla) formation.&lt;ref name="Francis1990"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Francis RB |title=Acquired purpura fulminans |journal=Semin Thromb Hemost |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=310–325 |year=1990 |pmid=2281320 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-1002684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of purpura fulminans lesions may be different according to the underlying pathogenesis.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2011/&gt; Purpura fulminans in severe sepsis typically develops in the distal extremities and progresses proximally or appears as a generalised or diffuse rash affecting the whole body surface.&lt;ref name=Francis1990/&gt; In cases of severe inheritable protein C deficiency, purpura fulminans with disseminated intravascular coagulation manifests within a few hours or days after birth.&lt;ref name=Goldenberg2008/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marlar1989"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marlar RA, Montgomery RR, Broekmans AW |title= Diagnosis and treatment of homozygous protein C deficiency. Report of the Working Party on Homozygous Protein C Deficiency of the Subcommittee on Protein C and Protein S, International Committee on Thrombosis and Haemostasis |journal=J Pediatr |volume=114 |issue=4 |pages=528–534 |year=1989 |pmid=2647943 |doi=10.1016/s0022-3476(89)80688-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laboratory investigations===                        
The cardinal features of purpura investigations are the same as those of disseminated intravascular coagulation: prolonged plasma clotting times, [[thrombocytopenia]], reduced plasma fibrinogen concentration, increased plasma fibrin-degradation products and occasionally microangiopathic haemolysis.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2011/&gt;

==Prevention==
For people who have severe congenital protein C deficiency, protein C replacement therapies are available, which is indicated and approved for use in the United States and Europe for the prevention of purpura fulminans. Protein C replacement is often in combination with anticoagulation therapy of injectable low molecular weight [[heparin]] or oral [[warfarin]].&lt;ref name="Dreyfus1991"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dreyfus M, Magny JF, Bridey F, Schwarz HP, Planche C, Dehan M, Tchernia G |title=Treatment of homozygous protein C deficiency and neonatal purpura fulminans with a purified protein C concentrate |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=325 |issue=22 |pages=1565–1568 |year=1991 |pmid=1944440 |doi=10.1056/nejm199111283252207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dreyfus1995"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Dreyfus M, Masterson M, David M, Rivard GE, Muller FM, Kreuz W, Beeg T, Minford A, Allgrove J, Cohen JD, etal |title=Replacement therapy with a monoclonal antibody purified protein C concentrate in newborns with severe congenital protein C deficiency |journal=Semin Thromb Hemost |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=371–381 |year=1995 |pmid=8747700 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-1000658}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12602374"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Human protein C: new preparations. Effective replacement therapy for some clotting disorders.  |journal=Prescrire Int |volume=12 |issue=63 |pages=11–13 |year=2003 |pmid=12602374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartman1989"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hartman KR, Manco-Johnson M, Rawlings JS, Bower DJ, Marlar RA |title=Homozygous protein C deficiency: early treatment with warfarin |journal=Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=395–401 |year=1989 |pmid=2618972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Monagle1998"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Monagle P, Andrew M, Halton J, Marlar R, Jardine L, Vegh P, Johnston M, Webber C, Massicotte MP |title=Homozygous protein C deficiency: description of a new mutation and successful treatment with low molecular weight heparin |journal=Thromb Haemost |volume=79 |issue=4 |pages=756–761 |year=1998 |pmid=9569188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before initiating warfarin therapy, a few days of therapeutic heparin may be administered to prevent [[warfarin skin necrosis]] and other progressive or recurrent thrombotic complications.&lt;ref name=Goldenberg2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Monagle1998/&gt;

===Complications of prevention===
The amount of fresh frozen plasma required to reverse disseminated intravascular coagulation associated with purpura fulminans may lead to complications of fluid overload and death, especially in neonates,&lt;ref name=Goldenberg2008/&gt; such as [[transfusion-related acute lung injury]]. Exposure to multiple plasma donors over time increases the cumulative risk for transfusion-associated viral infection and allergic reaction to donor proteins found in fresh frozen plasma.&lt;ref name=Goldenberg2008/&gt;

Allergic reactions and [[alloantibody]] formation are also potential complications, as with any protein replacement therapy.&lt;ref name=Goldenberg2008/&gt;
                             
Concomitant warfarin therapy in subjects with congenital protein C deficiency is associated with an increased risk of [[warfarin skin necrosis]].&lt;ref name=Goldenberg2008/&gt;

== Treatment==
Early stage sepsis-associated purpura fulminans may be reversible with quick therapeutic intervention.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldenberg2008"/&gt; Treatment is mainly removing the underlying cause and degree of clotting abnormalities and with supportive treatment (antibiotics, volume expansion, tissue oxygenation, etc.). Thus, treatment includes aggressive management of the septic state.

Purpura fulminans with disseminated intravascular coagulation should be urgently treated with [[fresh frozen plasma]] (10–20 mL/kg every 8–12 hours) and/or protein C concentrate to replace pro-coagulant and anticoagulant plasma proteins that have been depleted by the disseminated intravascular coagulation process.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ghosh2009/&gt;&lt;ref name="Estelles1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldenberg2008/&gt;

Protein C in plasma in the steady state has a half life of 6- to 10-hour, therefore, patients with severe protein C deficiency and presenting with purpura fulminans can be treated acutely with an initial bolus of protein C concentrate 100 IU/kg followed by 50 IU /kg  every 6 hours.&lt;ref name=Goldenberg2008/&gt; A total of 1 IU/kg of protein C concentrate or 1 mL/kg of fresh frozen plasma will increase the plasma concentration of protein C by 1 IU/dL.&lt;ref name=Goldenberg2008/&gt; Cases with [[comorbid]] pathological bleeding may require additional transfusions with [[platelet]] concentrate (10–15 mL/kg) or [[cryoprecipitate]] (5 mL/kg).&lt;ref name=Chalmers2011/&gt;

Established soft tissue necrosis may require surgical removal of the dead tissue, [[fasciotomy]], [[amputation]] or reconstructive surgery.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2011/&gt;

==Prognosis==
Purpura fulminans lesions, once established, often progress within 24 to 48 hours to full-thickness skin necrosis or soft-tissue necrosis. Once purpura fulminans lesions progress to full-thickness skin necrosis, healing takes between 4–8 weeks and leaves large scars.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2011/&gt;

Without treatment, necrotic soft tissue may become gangrenous, leading to loss of limbs.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2011/&gt; Purpura fulminans is often accompanied by micro-vascular [[thrombosis]] and [[haemorrhagic infarction]] in other tissues, such as the [[lungs]], [[kidneys]], [[central nervous system]] and [[adrenal glands]], leading to multiple organ failure, and causes initial high mortality and long-term morbidity in survivors.Purpura fulminans may also lead to severe large vessel [[venous thrombosis]] if untreated in its early stages.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2011/&gt;

Purpura fulminans secondary to severe infection is self-limiting.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2011/&gt; In cases of homozygous protein C deficiency, episodes of purpura fulminans and other thrombotic events are recurrent.&lt;ref name=Estelles1984/&gt; Moreover, infant survival due to maintenance replacement therapy is often associated with mental retardation and/or visual impairment.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gladson1987"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gladson CL, Groncy P, Griffin JH |title=Coumarin necrosis, neonatal purpura fulminans, and protein C deficiency |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=123 |issue=12 |pages=1701a-1706a |year=1987 |pmid=2961308 |doi=10.1001/archderm.1987.01660360157029}}&lt;/ref&gt; For post-infection purpura fulminans, new lesions will occur while neutralising autoantibodies are present (1–2 weeks after presentation).&lt;ref name=Levin1995/&gt;

A multi-disciplinary care team is usually required for rehabilitation after purpura fulminans.&lt;ref name=Chalmers2011/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Purpura fulminans is rare and most commonly occurs in babies and small children&lt;ref name="Tuddenham1989"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tuddenham, EG, Takase T, Thomas, AE, Awidi AS, Madanat FF, Abu Hajir MM, Kernoff PB Hoffbrand AV |title=Homozygous protein C deficiency with delayed onset of symptoms at 7 to 10 months |journal=Thromb Res |volume=53 |issue=5 |pages=475–84 |year=1989 |pmid=2660320 |doi=10.1016/0049-3848(89)90202-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but can also be a rare manifestation in adults when it is associated with severe infections.&lt;ref name="Lerolle2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lerolle N, Carlotti A, Melican K, Aubey F, Pierrot M, Diehl JL, Caille V, Hekimian G, Gandrille S, Mandet C, Bruneval P, Dumenil G, Borgel D |title=Assessment of the interplay between blood and skin vascular abnormalities in adult purpura fulminans |journal=Am J Respir Crit Care Med |volume=188 |issue=6|pages=684–692 |year=2013 |pmid=23924269 |doi=10.1164/rccm.201302-0228oc}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Meningococcal septicaemia]] is complicated by purpura fulminans in 10–20% of cases among children.&lt;ref name="Wong1989"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wong VK, Hitchcock W, Mason WH |title=Meningococcal infections in children: a review of 100 cases |journal=Pediatr Infect Dis J |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=224–227 |year=1989 |pmid=2654860}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purpura fulminans associated with [[congenital]] (inherited) protein C deficiency occurs in 1:500,000–1,000,000 live births.&lt;ref name="Manco-Johnson1991"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Manco-Johnson MJ, Abshire TC, Jacobson LJ, Marlar RA |title=Severe neonatal protein C deficiency: prevalence and thrombotic risk |journal=J Pediatr |volume=119 |issue=5 |pages=793–798 |year=1991 |pmid=1834822 |doi=10.1016/s0022-3476(05)80305-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Due to the rarity of Purpura fulminans and its occurrence in vulnerable patient groups like children research on the condition is very limited and evidence based knowledge is scarce. Currently, there is only one Purpura fulminans related clinical research project, http://www.sapfire-registry.org/, which is registered with [[ClinicalTrials.gov|clinicaltrials.gov]].[http://www.sapfire-registry.org/]

== History ==
Purpura fulminans was first described by Guelliot in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Guelliot A|year=1884|title=Note sur trois cas de purpusa infectieux foudroyant|journal=Un Med Sci Nord-Est|volume=8|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Safety Pharmacology Society''' ('''SPS''') is a global scientific society fostering best practice around the discipline of [[safety pharmacology]]. The society has a mission statement which declares it is a nonprofit organization that promotes knowledge, development, application, and training in safety pharmacology—a distinct scientific discipline that integrates the best practices of pharmacology, physiology and toxicology. The objective of safety pharmacology studies is to further the discovery, development and safe use of biologically active chemical entities and large molecules by the identification, monitoring and characterization of potentially undesirable pharmacodynamic activities in nonclinical studies. The Safety Pharmacology Society also supports the human safety of drugs and biologicals by fostering scientific research, education, and dissemination of scientific information through meetings and other scientific interactions.

The Safety Pharmacology Society was incorporated in 2001, at the time when the [[International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use]] was issuing ICH S7A,&lt;ref&gt;ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Safety Pharmacology Studies for Human Use. ICH S7A.&lt;/ref&gt; a regulatory guidance covering safety pharmacology and drafting ICH S7B&lt;ref&gt;ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Safety Pharmacology Studies for Human Use. ICH S7B. The nonclinical evaluation of the potential for delayed ventricular repolarisation (QT interval prolongation) by human pharmaceuticals.&lt;/ref&gt; which is more specific to potential effects of new drugs on cardiac repolarization. Prior to 2001 many of the same scientific experts met once a year in Philadelphia. The historical birth of safety pharmacology is described by Alan Bass, Lewis Kinter, Patricia Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Bass, Lewis Kinter, Patricia Williams (2004) Origins, practices and future of safety pharmacology. Journal of Pharmacological and Toxicological Methods, Volume 49, Issue 3, Pages 145-151.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the authors Alan Bass and Lewis Kinter are past presidents of the Safety Pharmacology Society.

The Safety Pharmacology Society, known by members as SPS, is composed of members from across the globe and reaches out internationally through meetings, [[webinar]]s and publications. The society provides a number of resources which are available to members and nonmembers; members clearly enjoy the widest benefits. The Safety Pharmacology Society also offers certification as Diplomate in Safety Pharmacology (DSP).&lt;ref&gt;Authier S, Curtis MJ, Soloviev M, Redfern WS, Kallman MJ, Hamlin RL, Leishman DJ, Valentin JP, Koerner JE, Vargas HM, Botchway A, Correll K, Pugsley MK. The Diplomate in Safety Pharmacology (DSP) certification scheme. J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods. 2015 Sep-Oct;75:1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The certification examination is offered at the annual society meeting.

As such the key values of the SPS embrace scientific excellence, knowledge, improving human and animal life, collaboration and cooperation, integrity, quality, and respect for individual diversity, initiative, education and personal development.

The Safety Pharmacology Society organizes an annual meeting in fall, comprising invited speakers, posters,&lt;ref&gt;Redfern WS, Valentin J-P (2011) Trends in safety pharmacology: Posters presented at the annual meetings of the Safety Pharmacology Society 2001–2010.  J Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods 64: 102–110.&lt;/ref&gt; continuing education courses and exhibits. This meeting has alternated between the United States and Europe. Recent meetings have been held in:

The '''striae of Retzius''' are incremental growth lines or bands seen in [[tooth enamel]]. They represent the incremental pattern of enamel, the successive apposition of different layers of enamel during crown formation.
 
==Appearance==
[[File:Frontzahn Oberkiefer 20090930 02.JPG|thumb|The terminations of Striae of Retzius in a canine, called perikymata. (Visible in the picture´s high resolution)]]
When viewed microscopically in cross-section, they appear as concentric rings.  In a longitudinal section, they appear as a series of dark bands.  The presence of the dark lines is similar to the annual rings on a tree.  They are named after Swedish anatomist [[Anders Retzius]].

In the longitudinal section of a tooth. these lines appear near the [[dentin]]. They bend obliquely near the cervical region. They curve occlusally near the cuspal regions or the incisal regions.

Produced during the second stage of enamel calcification, also known as the maturation stage, [[ameloblast]]s produce matrix and enamel at the rate of 4 micrometers per day; however every fourth day there is a change in development. Brownish lines, the striae of Retzius, develop as a result of a change in the growth process. Macroscopically, these lines can be seen on the [[Lip|labial]] surface or lip side of anterior or front teeth as  horizontal lines on the [[Crown (tooth)|tooth crown]], also known as [[Perikyma|perikymata]] or "imbrication lines" .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | isbn = 978-0-323-01954-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evenly spaced Retzius lines indicate a 6- to 11-day cycle of enamel formation.

==Causes==
Occasional darker striae or grooves of Retzius result from systemic disturbances in the human body.  For example, a [[fever]] can cause some lines to appear darker than those surrounding them. Normally, [[amelogenesis]] involves a period of enamel matrix formation and a rest period. In case of any disturbance, the rest periods are prolonged and occur close to one another. Consequently, the line of Retzius appears broader and much more prominent, often presenting a brownish colour under the microscope. The [[neonatal line]] is the darkest band, which represents the disrupted enamel formation due to the stress of being born.

It is also said to occur due to periodic bending of [[enamel rods]].

The formation of the striae of Retzius results from a constriction of [[Tomes' process]]es when the activity of [[ameloblast]]s – cells only present in laying down enamel – is narrowed in conjunction with an increasing process of [[interrod enamel]] development.  The striae of Retzius often extends from the [[Dental-enamel junction]] to the outer surface, ending in shallow pits known as [[perikymata]].

==Qualities==
Lines of Retzius (think age bands like tree growth rings) – Stria (A)
* artifacts in enamel (not found in [[dentin]]) created by incremental steps of ameloblasts
* comparable to the contour "lines of Owen" in dentin
* have increased organic content and show the variations in rhythm as the tooth enamel matrix calcifies
* follow an appositional or side-by-side growth pattern

==Illustrations==
Several diagrams and photographs of these lines (and others) appears in a document published by the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]] on their website:

[[File:SwissTPH-Reisemedizin.JPG|thumbnail|The entrance to the travel medicine of the Swiss TPH. The main building, with offices, research labs and the lecture hall, is located behind.]]
The '''Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute''' or '''Swiss TPH''', (formerly known as the Swiss Tropical Institute) was founded in 1943  as through the initiative of Professor [[Rudolf Geigy]]. He recognised the need to combine sound interdisciplinary research within the context of the social and cultural conditions of an endemic area with training and service provision. He felt that this approach would generate new evidence as well as contribute to health development. Since then, this goal remains the mandate of the Swiss TPH - to contribute to the improvement of the health of populations internationally and nationally through excellence in research, services, and teaching and training with a special focus on developing countries.

The Swiss TPH consists of five departments working in various disciplines of International Public Health. In June 2009, the Institute for Social and Preventive Medicine of the University of Basel was integrated into the Swiss Tropical Institute, and in January 2010 the Swiss Tropical Institute changed its name to the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute.

The Swiss TPH is an Associated Institute of the [[University of Basel]], and as a public organization, is partially supported by the [[Swiss Federal Council]] and the [[Canton of Basel-Stadt]]. The greater part of its funding comes from competitively acquired project funds and the earnings of its service departments: Medical Services, Medicines Research and the Swiss Centre for International Health.

==Research==

The Institute has research programs in [[epidemiology]] and [[public health]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swisstph.ch/?id=396 Swiss TPH - Epidemiology and Public Health]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[medical parasitology]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swisstph.ch/?id=398 Swiss TPH - Medical Parasitology &amp; Infection Biology]&lt;/ref&gt; covering the fields of molecular [[parasitology]] and molecular [[epidemiology]], molecular [[diagnostics]], molecular [[immunology]], parasite [[chemotherapy]], [[biostatistics]] and [[epidemiology]], [[health systems]] research, human &amp; animal health, [[ecosystem health]] and [[social sciences]]. One particular research focus of the institute is the biology of the [[malaria]] parasite ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]''.

==Services==

The service departments of the Swiss TPH address travel medicine and drug research, as well as health system development. The '''Medical Services''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swisstph.ch/?id=54 Swiss TPH - Medical Services]&lt;/ref&gt; department offers clinical and diagnostic services for tropical medicine, travel advice, and vaccinations for travelers to tropical countries. The '''Swiss Centre for International Health'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swisstph.ch/?id=53 Swiss Centre for International Health]&lt;/ref&gt; offers expertise in the field of international health system development both within Switzerland and globally. The '''Medicines Research''' department&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swisstph.ch/?id=1096 Swiss TPH - Medicines Research]&lt;/ref&gt; contributes to bridging the 'translational gaps' in the R&amp;D-process for drugs, vaccines and public health interventions between promising research outcomes and their validation and implementation for impact in resource limited economies.

==Teaching and Training==

All departments of the Swiss TPH take part in teaching and training in various forms. As an associated institute of the University of Basel, numerous Swiss TPH staff have teaching obligations at the University. The Institute is involved in the BSc studies in biology and also responsible for the newly established PhD programmes. The Institute additionally offers an MSc in Infection Biology and Epidemiology.

In postgraduate teaching and training, and continuous education the Swiss TPH offers several short courses for health specialists from Europe and countries with resource constraints. These courses are accredited by the University of Basel. In cooperation with partner institutes in Europe and overseas the institute offers a Master of Advanced Studies in International Health, accredited by the OAQ (Center of Accreditation and Quality Assurance of the Swiss Universities).

The Swiss TPH also offers several tailored courses for participants with specific backgrounds (medical doctors, pharmacists, lab technicians), the “General Tropical Course“ (in German language), as well as courses within the curriculum of the [http://www.ssphplus.ch/ Swiss School of Public Health] (SSPH+).

[[File:Take Back The Night march Alamogordo 2010.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Take Back the Night march in [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]].]]

'''Take Back the Night''' is an international event and non-profit organization with the mission of ending sexual, relationship, and domestic violence in all forms.  Hundreds of events are held in over 30 countries annually.  Events often include marches, rallies and vigils intended as a protest and [[direct action]] against [[rape]] and other forms of [[sexual violence|sexual]], [[relationship violence|relationship]] and [[domestic violence]].  In 2001, a group of women who had participated in the earliest Take Back the Night marches, came together to form the '''Take Back the Night Foundation''' in support of the events throughout the United States and the world.

==History==
Take Back the Night Foundation's Board members have participated in Take Back the Night marches and events from the 1970s to present day.  Early Take Back the Night events include a protest in San Francisco against pornography in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Bronstein, Carolyn (2011). Battling Pornography: The American Anti-Pornography
Feminist Movement, 1976-1986. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p 165-166.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first "Take Back the Night" marches was held in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] in October 1975, after the murder of a microbiologist, Susan Alexander Speeth, who was stabbed to death while walking home alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themaneater.com/stories/2010/9/22/students-take-back-night/|title=Students 'Take Back the Night' on Columbia streets|work=themaneater.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Take Back the Night" was used as the title of a 1977 memorial read by [[Anne Pride]] at an anti-violence rally in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://research.umbc.edu/~korenman/wmst/takenite2.html|title=Take Back the Night|publisher=[[UMBC]]| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830094900/http://research.umbc.edu/~korenman/wmst/takenite2.html | archivedate=August 30, 2006|accessdate=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
Events typically consist of a rally followed by a march and often a speak-out or candlelight vigil on violence against women.  Early marches were often deliberately women-only in order to symbolize women's individual walk through darkness and to demonstrate that women united can resist fear and violence. (Most marches in the present day include men; the organization differs as each event is organized locally.) The women-only policies caused controversy on some campuses; activists argued that male allies and sexual assault survivors should be allowed to march in support of women and male victims of sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2008/04/17/first-time-men-will-join-full-take-back-night-march |title=For First Time, Men Will Join Full Take Back the Night March |work=[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]|first=Joy|last=Resmovits|date=2008-04-17|accessdate=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In current practice, Take Back the Night events are not only inclusive of men, but include men as victims, bystanders, and supporters. Wesleyan University in Connecticut allows men to participate in speaking on their own experiences with sexual assault. The march at Wesleyan University includes performances by a cappella groups. Until 2012, when an all-male group was also invited to perform, these performances were done by two of the university's all women groups. Bowdoin College in Maine organizes a similar candlelight vigil and walk that encourages students of all genders to show solidarity for survivors on campus and in this nation. Michigan State University's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theear.org/TBTN/Demands.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025225407/http://theear.org/TBTN/Demands.htm |archivedate=2014-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Take Back the Night event includes a list of demands to the university community to end sexual violence.

While the march began as a way to protest the [[violence]] that women experienced while walking in public at night, the purpose of these marches was to speak out against this violence and raise community awareness as a preventive measure against future violence.  The mission of Take Back the Night has since grown to encompass all forms of violence against all persons, though sexual violence against women is still the top focus.  The word ''night'' was originally meant to be taken literally to express the fear that many women feel during the night but has since changed to symbolize a fear of violence in general.  This helps the movement incorporate other feminist concerns such as [[domestic violence]] and [[sexual abuse]] within the home.  Take Back the Night events occur on college campuses, in major metropolitan areas, in small towns, on military bases, and even in high schools.  International events have been documented in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Bermuda, Canada, Italy, Poland, Germany, Hungary, India, England and many other countries.  The common purpose is to advocate for the right of everyone to feel safe from sexual violence.

{{quote|Women are often told to be extra careful and take precautions when going out at night.   In some parts of the world, even today, women are not allowed out at night.   So when women struggle for freedom, we must start at the beginning by fighting for freedom of movement, which we have not had and do not now have.  We must recognize that freedom of movement is a precondition for anything else.  It comes before freedom of speech in importance because without it freedom of speech cannot in fact exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/WarZoneChaptIb.html Source&lt;/ref&gt;]|The Night and Danger by [[Andrea Dworkin]]}}

On November 7, 2009 the first Take the Back the Night annual conference took place at Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avoncompany.com/women/news/press20090709.html |title=Avon Foundation Newsroom |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109024249/http://www.avoncompany.com/women/news/press20090709.html| archivedate=2010-01-09|publisher=Avoncompany.com |date=2009-07-09 |accessdate=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and debate==
While some Take Back the Night marches encourage men to participate, others still have refused to allow men (even male victims of sexual assault) to be involved under the claim of creating a "safe space" for women. Several critics have argued that this ignores the struggles of male victims and fails to provide them male role models, as well as implying the need to "take back the night" from all men, not just the minority who are perpetrators of sexual violence. Advocacy for having a broad coalition of participants including men, women, and [[Transgenderism|transgender individuals]] alike has come from many different commentators in a variety of publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/05/27/robyn-urback-theo-fleurys-victor-walk-brings-the-silent-suffering-of-male-abuse-victims-into-the-open/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629234923/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/05/27/robyn-urback-theo-fleurys-victor-walk-brings-the-silent-suffering-of-male-abuse-victims-into-the-open/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-06-29|title=Theo Fleury's 'Victor Walk' brings the silent suffering of male abuse victims into the open|first=Robyn|last=Urback|work=[[National Post]]|date=2013-05-27|accessdate=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/09/23/urban-scrawl-toronto-march-ignores-male-sex-abuse-victims/|title=Urban Scrawl: Toronto march ignores male sex abuse victims|first=Robyn|last=Urback|work=[[National Post]]|date=2011-09-23|accessdate=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=good/&gt;

The specific focus of some Take Back the Night events on sexual assaults from strangers and the lack of focus on [[date rape]], [[child sexual abuse]], [[parental incest]], and other such forms of victimization has attracted criticism from a broad group of commentators such as Megan Greenwell of ''Good Magazine''. Greenwell has remarked that the use of the "righteous rape" trope by Take Back the Night participants, to refer to sexual assault in the open by strangers as being somehow inherently morally different to other types of assault, is belittling and wrong.&lt;ref name=good&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.good.is/articles/how-take-back-the-night-keeps-some-victims-silent|title=How 'Take Back the Night' Keeps Some Victims Silent|work=GOOD Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the higher-education context, the policy of some institutions to make Take Back the Night events mandatory for students, compelling them to attend regardless of whether they want to or not, has come under criticism by some women's rights activists as being [[Hypocrisy|hypocritical]] and inherently self-defeating. After a 2015 controversy at [[Virginia Tech]] emerged in which a mandatory event had some football players in the audience laugh at accounts of sexual assault, try to leave early, and otherwise disrupt the process, 'Womanspace' Co-President Malavika Sahai remarked, "Requiring people to go to an event encroaches on that safe space... [i]f you don't want to be there, you really shouldn't be there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/education/higher_education/virginia_tech/virginia-tech-football-players-accused-of-hindering-safe-space-at/article_9881792c-44d5-5707-b361-377a95782186.html |title=Virginia Tech football players accused of hindering 'safe space' at Take Back the Night event|work=www.roanoke.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VAWD logo.png|thumb|right|Seal of VAWD-approved faculties]]
The '''Verified-Accredited Wholesale Distributors''' ('''VAWD''') program was established in 2004 to help protect the public from the
threat of counterfeit drugs.&lt;ref name=VAWD&gt;[http://www.nabp.net/programs/accreditation/vawd/ VAWD], National Association of Boards of Pharmacy
 {{retrieved|access-date= February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The VAWD program was developed and is administered by the [[National Association of Boards of Pharmacy]] (NABP).&lt;ref name=VAWD/&gt;  The program offers an accreditation to wholesale distribution facilities by offering an objective, third-party
audit system.

The criteria to earn VAWD accreditation program includes a compliance review, criteria including: licensure verification, on-site survey and examination, screening through NABP's Clearinghouse, Criminal background checks for responsible persons.  The facility must employ security and best practices for safe distribution.  Resurveys of accredited sites will be performed by trained NABP surveyors before accreditation may be renewed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1055">The term '''vertical resistance''', used commonly in context of plant selection, was first used by J.E. Vanderplank&lt;ref name=Vanderplank1963&gt;Vanderplank, J.E. (1963) Plant Diseases: Epidemics and Control. Academic Press, New York and London, 349pp.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe single-gene resistance. This contrasted the term [[Horizontal Resistance|horizontal resistance]] which was used to describe many-gene resistance. [[Raoul A Robinson|Raoul A. Robinson]] &lt;ref name=Robinson1976&gt;[[Raoul A Robinson|Robinson, Raoul A.]] (1976) Plant Pathosystems. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, 184pp.&lt;/ref&gt; further refined the definition of vertical resistance, emphasizing that in vertical resistance there are single genes for resistance in the host plant, and there are also single genes for parasitic ability in the parasite. This phenomenon is known as the [[gene-for-gene relationship]], and it is the defining character of vertical resistance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4403">The '''Virtual Soldier Research program''' (VSR) is a research group within the [[University of Iowa]]  [[Center for Computer-Aided Design]] (CCAD). VSR was founded by Professor Karim Abdel-Malek in 2003 through external funding from the US Army Tank Automotive Command (TACOM) to put the Warfighter at the center of US Army product designs.&lt;ref&gt;Abdel-Malek, K., Yang, J., Kim, J.H., Beck, S., Swan, C., Frey-Law, L., Mathai, A., Murphy, C., Rahmatalla, S., and Arora, J. (2007). Development of the Virtual-Human Santos™. In V.G. Duffy (Ed.): Digital Human Modeling, HCII 2007, LNCS-4561, pp. 490-499.
&lt;/ref&gt; Using this initial research and funding as a foundation, VSR continues to develop new technologies in digital human modeling and simulation.

VSR's digital human model, Santos (R), stands at the center of its digital human modeling and simulation research.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ccad.uiowa.edu/vsr/about&lt;/ref&gt; The high-fidelity, biomechanically accurate musculoskeletal model incorporates 215 [[degrees of freedom]], including the hand,&lt;ref&gt;Pena-Pitarch, E., Yang, J., and Abdel-Malek, K. (2005). Santos™ Hand: A 25-Degree-of-Freedom Model, SAE Technical Paper 2005-01-2727, doi: 10.4271/2005-01-2727.&lt;/ref&gt; feet, and eyes. The dimensions of the skeleton are mutable, able to represent any anthropometric cross section. In addition, Santos includes a muscular system with the ability to predict muscle activation and muscle forces in real time, using a novel optimization-based methodology.

The mathematical model for the Santos skeleton was developed based on the [[Denavit–Hartenberg parameters|Denavit-Hartenberg]] method for kinematic and dynamic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Denavit, J., &amp; Hartenberg, R. S. (1955). A kinematic notation for lower-pair mechanisms based on matrices. Journal of Applied Mechanics,
77, 215–221.&lt;/ref&gt; Optimization is used to determine postures and motions that are governed by various human performance measures (objective functions) and constrained by the restrictions imposed by the skeleton, the laws of physics, and the environment. 

VSR research has led to the spin-off of a private company, Santos Human Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.santoshumaninc.com/&lt;/ref&gt; specifically focused on product development.

'''Who is Santos™?'''

Santos is the virtual human who stands at the center of our digital human modeling and simulation research. Our high-fidelity, biomechanically accurate musculoskeletal model was developed from the inside out by our team of biomedical engineers, and incorporates 215 degrees of freedom, including the hand, feet, and eyes. The dimensions of the skeleton are mutable, able to represent any anthropometric cross section. In addition, Santos includes a muscular system with the ability to predict muscle activation and muscle forces in real time, using a novel optimization-based methodology.

Over time, the Santos family has grown to incorporate a variety of different body scans to provide a range of models that include our female version, Sophia, and a broad array of different body shapes, types, and sizes. Our research is currently being extended to allow multiple digital human models to interact with each other to complete tasks cooperatively.

Santos was built using state-of-the-art technologies adapted from robotics, Hollywood, and the game industry. Our research continues to grow in its dynamic capabilities, physiology, and intelligent behaviors through integration of Artifical Intelligence, design optimization, physics-based modeling, and advanced, multi-scale physiological models.

The mathematical model for the Santos skeleton was developed based on the Denavit-Hartenberg method for kinematic and dynamic analysis. Optimization is used to determine postures and motions that are governed by various human performance measures (objective functions) and constrained by the restrictions imposed by the skeleton, the laws of physics, and the environment. The software must be as fast and efficient as possible in an effort to provide real-time simulations.
