The guests of honor were [[Harlan Ellison]] (pro) and Bill Bowers (fan). [[Josef Nesvadba]] had been announced as the [[Europe]]an guest of honor for IguanaCon, but he could not get travel papers and did not attend. The toastmaster was [[F. M. Busby]]. Total attendance was approximately 4,700.

The film stars [[Britt Robertson]], [[KJ Apa]], [[Juliet Rylance]], [[John Ortiz]], [[Kirby Howell-Baptiste]], [[Peggy Lipton]], [[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Josh Gad]].

The film is a co-production between [[Amblin Entertainment]], [[Reliance Entertainment]], [[Walden Media]] and [[Pariah Entertainment Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scheck|first1=Frank|title='A Dog's Purpose': Film Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/a-dogs-purpose-review-968085|accessdate=February 3, 2017|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=January 24, 2017|quote=Production companies: Amblin Entertainment, Reliance Entertainment, Walden Media, Pariah Entertainment Group Distributor: Universal Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barker|first1=Andrew|title=Film Review: 'A Dog's Purpose'|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/a-dogs-purpose-film-review-1201969033/|accessdate=March 7, 2017|work=Variety|date=January 24, 2016|quote=A Universal Pictures release of an Amblin Entertainment and Reliance Entertainment presentation in association with Walden Media of a Pariah production}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released by [[Universal Pictures]] on January 27, 2017, and grossed over $204 million worldwide.

A week prior to the film's release, a video surfaced on [[TMZ]] showing footage taken from the set of the film, which showed a [[German Shepherd]] dragged and dipped into rushing water while visibly resisting. After initial backlash, it was determined the video had been deliberately edited to mislead viewers.&lt;ref name=investigation/&gt;

A sequel, titled ''A Dog's Journey'', is scheduled for release on May 17, 2019.&lt;ref name="sequel" /&gt;

==Plot==
{{long plot|date=January 2018}}
In the 1950s, a feral puppy is born, wondering what life's true purpose is. Two weeks later, he is whisked away to the [[dog pound]] and quickly [[euthanized]], wondering if "fun" truly is life's purpose.

His strong [[reincarnation|spirit is reborn and reincarnated]] as a newborn [[Retriever]] puppy in 1961. He leaves his cage at a [[puppy mill]] and is found by two garbage men who plan to sell him. They leave to drink, and the dog is spotted locked inside their pick-up truck by a young boy named Ethan and his mother, who rescue him from heatstroke. After they convince Ethan's father, the dog is allowed to stay and is renamed Bailey.

Bailey and Ethan bond quickly, especially over the summer when the family visits Ethan's maternal grandparents' farm, and Bailey now believes Ethan alone is his purpose. Years pass, and after several attempts at advancing in his job fail, Ethan's father has become a deadbeat alcoholic.

Over the summer, Ethan goes to a fair with Bailey and meets Hannah, whom he quickly begins dating. Ethan and Hannah spend their summer happy together though their senior years are upcoming, but they plan to go to the same school; Ethan getting a football scholarship and Hannah following him on an academic one. When he goes home one night, Ethan's father is drunk and shouting at Ethan's mother. He turns on Ethan then and when his mother tries to keep them separated, he shoves her to the ground. Ethan orders his father to leave and never come back.

Later, at a football game watched by scouts, Ethan is offered a full scholarship to Michigan State, but that night a vindictive classmate named Todd throws a lit firecracker into Ethan's house as a prank, which unintentionally results in a house fire. Bailey alerts Ethan, who goes to save his mother. Unable to get out of the door, they head out through his mother's bedroom window upstairs. Ethan first lowers her with her sheets to the neighbors below, then saves Bailey. However, he drops his rope and must jump, badly fracturing his leg and ending his athletic scholarship. Bailey attacks Todd, who is arrested by the police when firecrackers fall out of his pocket. Now, Ethan must go to an [[agricultural school]] where he will learn to take over his grandparents' farm. Falling into depression, Ethan breaks off his romance with Hannah before leaving for college, while Bailey stays with Ethan's grandparents. Sometime afterward, an aged Bailey is put to sleep at the veterinarian's office.

Bailey reincarnates into another dog life, a female [[German Shepherd]] [[police dog]] named Ellie, sometime in the late 1970s/early 1980s, while possessing full memories of his past lives. Ellie is partnered with a widowed officer named Carlos from the [[Chicago Police Department]] and works hard at "seeking" and "finding", now seeing the job as life's purpose. The two form a close relationship which ends after Ellie saves a kidnapped girl from drowning and is then fatally shot by the kidnapper.

Reborn again in the mid-1980s as a [[Pembroke Welsh Corgi]], he forms a bond with an Atlanta college student named Maya who names him Tino. Maya is lonely, and Tino makes it his purpose to find her some happiness. She starts a relationship with a classmate named Al whom she begins seeing after Tino falls for Al's dog, a black and white [[Landseer (dog)|Landseer]] named Roxie. Maya and Al marry and have 3 children. In love with Roxie, Tino is heartbroken when one day she does not return from the vet. As he lies sleeping, Tino thanks Maya for giving him one of his best lives.

Tino is again reborn and reincarnated, this time as a [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]]-[[Australian Shepherd]] mix, only to be taken in by a neglectful urban couple who name him Waffles. Waffles is dumped in an abandoned lot and sets off in search of a new life. He gradually makes his way to the country area where he spent summers as Bailey and joyfully reunites with his old master Ethan, who is now in his 50s, living a lonely life at his grandparents' old farm, which he now owns and runs. Ethan hands him over to the local animal shelter but soon has a change of heart and reclaims him, naming him Buddy. Buddy, sensing that he has finally found the true purpose of life, reunites Ethan with a widowed Hannah, and they get married.

Buddy convinces Ethan that he is his beloved childhood pet by performing some tricks and responding to key phrases that were known only to the two of them many years ago. The dog in voiceover tells the viewer that life is about having fun; saving others; not getting caught in the past or regrets; finding someone to be with; and living for today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22105">The '''Ames Moot Court Competition''' is the annual upper level [[moot court]] competition at [[Harvard Law School]]. It is designed and administered by the '''HLS Board of Student Advisers''' and has been in existence since 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~hlsbsa/?q=ames BSA Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format and history==

As currently structured, the official competition begins in the fall (usually October or November) of students' 2L year with a round-robin qualifying round. Each team at this stage consists of four participants, who each argue twice in teams of two. The four teams with the highest scores advance to the semi-finals in the spring. Each team is then allowed to add two participants, for a total of six people per team; two members of each team present oral argument in this round, typically before a panel of one federal appellate judge, one district judge, and one state court judge. In the competition's final round, held in the fall of the 3L year, the two remaining teams argue a case before a panel that usually consists of one [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] justice and two judges from the [[United States courts of appeal]]. Prizes are awarded for the best [[Legal brief|brief]], best oralist, and best overall team.

The competition originally was organized around the school's now-defunct law clubs. The competition occurs primarily in students' 2L year because the faculty found that, for students who did not finish at the very top of their first clear class, "it [was hard] for them to take the same interest in their work, particularly in the work within the law clubs, participation in which depends entirely upon their own volition." Thus, to encourage students to continue working hard, the Ames finalists received prizes of $200 for first place and $100 for second place. After several years of a single-elimination tournament, the format changed to a round-robin that more closely resembles the current qualifying round structure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xccnAAAAYAAJ A Centennial History of Harvard Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

The final round competition is one of the most popular events at the Law School each year, especially because a justice from the U.S. Supreme Court usually presides. The Ames Final Round has occasionally been televised on C-SPAN; for instance, the 1995 finals, featuring Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] as the presiding judge, is available online [http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/68421-1 here].

Many have found the Ames competition to be a demanding but rewarding experience. [http://www.courts.state.co.us/Bio.cfm/Employee_ID/61 Chief Justice Mary Mullarkey] of the Colorado Supreme Court, an Ames semi-finalist in her time at Harvard, wrote that "what was most rewarding was the opportunity to work as a team with other students. We could debate, argue, and challenge each other as we analyzed the case and prepared the briefs. The process was much more satisfying than the routine of classroom lectures and solitary examinations. The Ames competition provided a realistic view of what practicing law could be like."&lt;ref&gt;27 Harv. Women's L.J. 367 (2004), available [http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlg/vol27/mullarkey.php here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605070922/http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlg/vol27/mullarkey.php |date=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Antony and Cleopatra''''' ([[First Folio]] title: '''''The Tragedie of Anthonie, and Cleopatra''''') is a [[Shakespearean tragedy|tragedy]] by [[William Shakespeare]]. The play was performed first circa 1607 at the [[Blackfriars Theatre]] or the [[Globe Theatre]] by the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]].&lt;ref name="barroll_dating"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Barroll

Its first appearance in print was in the [[First Folio|Folio]] of 1623.

The plot is based on [[Thomas North]]'s translation of [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives]]'' and follows the relationship between [[Cleopatra]] and [[Mark Antony]] from the time of the [[Sicilian revolt]] to [[Death of Cleopatra|Cleopatra's suicide]] during the [[Final War of the Roman Republic]]. The major antagonist is [[Augustus|Octavius Caesar]], one of Antony's fellow [[triumviri|triumvirs]] of the [[Second Triumvirate]] and the first emperor of the [[Roman Empire]]. The tragedy is mainly set in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Egypt]] and is characterized by swift shifts in geographical location and linguistic register as it alternates between sensual, imaginative [[Alexandria]] and a more pragmatic, austere Rome.

Many consider Shakespeare's Cleopatra, whom Enobarbus describes as having "infinite variety", as one of the most complex and fully developed female characters in the playwright's body of work.&lt;ref name=Neill /&gt;{{rp|p.45}} She is frequently vain and histrionic enough to provoke an audience almost to scorn; at the same time, Shakespeare invests her and Antony with tragic grandeur. These contradictory features have led to famously divided critical responses.&lt;ref&gt;Bevington, David, ed. ''Antony and Cleopatra''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990: 12–14 {{ISBN|0521848334}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to classify ''Antony and Cleopatra'' as belonging to a single genre. It can be described as a [[Shakespearean history|history play]] (though it does not completely adhere to historical accounts), as a [[Shakespearean tragedy|tragedy]] (though not completely in [[Tragedy#Aristotle|Aristotelian]] terms), as a [[Shakespearean comedy|comedy]], as a [[Romance (love)|romance]], and according to some critics, such as McCarter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccarter.org/antonyandcleopatra/3-explore/classifying.html|title=Antony &amp; Cleopatra – McCarter Theatre Center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Shakespearean_problem_play|problem play]]. All that can be said with certainty is that it is a Roman play, and perhaps even a sequel to another of Shakespeare's tragedies, ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''.

== Synopsis ==
[[File:Cleopatra - John William Waterhouse.jpg|thumb|left|''Cleopatra'' by [[John William Waterhouse]] (1888)]]

Mark Antony – one of the triumvirs of the Roman Republic, along with Octavius and Lepidus – has neglected his soldierly duties after being beguiled by Egypt's Queen, Cleopatra. He ignores Rome's domestic problems, including the fact that his third wife [[Fulvia]] [[Perusine War|rebelled against Octavius]] and then died.

Octavius calls Antony back to Rome from Alexandria to help him fight against Sextus Pompey, Menecrates, and Menas, three notorious pirates of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. At Alexandria, Cleopatra begs Antony not to go, and though he repeatedly affirms his deep passionate love for her, he eventually leaves.

The triumvirs meet in Rome, where Antony and Octavius put to rest, for now, their disagreements. Octavius' general, Agrippa, suggests that Antony should marry Octavius's sister, Octavia, in order to cement the friendly bond between the two men. Antony accepts. Antony's lieutenant Enobarbus, though, knows that Octavia can never satisfy him after Cleopatra. In a famous passage, he describes Cleopatra's charms: "Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale / Her infinite variety: other women cloy / The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry / Where most she satisfies."

A soothsayer warns Antony that he is sure to lose if he ever tries to fight Octavius.

In Egypt, Cleopatra learns of Antony's marriage to Octavia and takes furious revenge upon the messenger who brings her the news. She grows content only when her courtiers assure her that Octavia is homely: short, low-browed, round-faced and with bad hair.

Before battle, the triumvirs parley with Sextus Pompey, and offer him a truce. He can retain [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]], but he must help them "rid the sea of pirates" and send them tributes. After some hesitation Sextus agrees. They engage in a drunken celebration on Sextus' galley, though the austere Octavius leaves early and sober from the party. Menas suggests to Sextus that he kill the three triumvirs and make himself ruler of the Roman Republic, but he refuses, finding it dishonourable. After Antony departs Rome for Athens, Octavius and Lepidus break their truce with Sextus and war against him. This is unapproved by Antony, and he is furious.

Antony returns to Alexandria and crowns Cleopatra and himself as rulers of Egypt and the eastern third of the Roman Republic (which was Antony's share as one of the triumvirs). He accuses Octavius of not giving him his fair share of Sextus' lands, and is angry that Lepidus, whom Octavius has imprisoned, is out of the triumvirate. Octavius agrees to the former demand, but otherwise is very displeased with what Antony has done.

[[File:Castro Battle of Actium.jpg|thumb|left|In this [[Baroque]] vision, ''Battle of Actium'' by [[Laureys a Castro]] (1672), Cleopatra flees, lower left, in a barge with a figurehead of [[Fortuna]].]]

Antony prepares to battle Octavius. Enobarbus urges Antony to fight on land, where he has the advantage, instead of by sea, where the navy of Octavius is lighter, more mobile and better manned. Antony refuses, since Octavius has dared him to fight at sea. Cleopatra pledges her fleet to aid Antony. However, during the [[Battle of Actium]] off the western coast of Greece, Cleopatra flees with her sixty ships, and Antony follows her, leaving his forces to ruin. Ashamed of what he has done for the love of Cleopatra, Antony reproaches her for making him a coward, but also sets this true and deep love above all else, saying "Give me a kiss; even this repays me."

Octavius sends a messenger to ask Cleopatra to give up Antony and come over to his side. She hesitates, and flirts with the messenger, when Antony walks in and angrily denounces her behavior. He sends the messenger to be whipped. Eventually, he forgives Cleopatra and pledges to fight another battle for her, this time on land.

On the eve of the battle, Antony's soldiers hear strange portents, which they interpret as the god [[Hercules]] abandoning his protection of Antony. Furthermore, Enobarbus, Antony's long-serving lieutenant, deserts him and goes over to Octavius' side. Rather than confiscating Enobarbus' goods, which Enobarbus did not take with him when he fled, Antony orders them to be sent to Enobarbus. Enobarbus is so overwhelmed by Antony's generosity, and so ashamed of his own disloyalty, that he dies from a broken heart.

Antony loses the battle as his troops desert en masse and he denounces Cleopatra: "This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me."  He resolves to kill her for the treachery. Cleopatra decides that the only way to win back Antony's love is to send him word that she killed herself, dying with his name on her lips. She locks herself in her monument, and awaits Antony's return.

[[File:The Death of Cleopatra arthur.jpg|thumb|''The Death of Cleopatra'' by {{Interlanguage link multi|Reginald Arthur|fr}} (1892)]]
Her plan backfires: rather than rushing back in remorse to see the "dead" Cleopatra, Antony decides that his own life is no longer worth living. He begs one of his aides, Eros, to run him through with a sword, but Eros cannot bear to do it and kills himself. Antony admires Eros' courage and attempts to do the same, but only succeeds in wounding himself. In great pain, he learns that Cleopatra is indeed alive. He is hoisted up to her in her monument and dies in her arms.

Octavius goes to Cleopatra trying to persuade her to surrender. She angrily refuses since she can imagine nothing worse than being led in chains through the streets of Rome, proclaimed a villain for the ages. She imagines that "the quick comedians / Extemporally will stage us, and present / Our Alexandrian revels: Antony / Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see / Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness / I' th' posture of a whore."  This speech is full of [[irony|dramatic irony]], because in Shakespeare's time Cleopatra really was played by a "squeaking boy" and Shakespeare's play does depict Antony's drunken revels.

Cleopatra is betrayed and taken into custody by the Romans. She gives Octavius what she claims is a complete account of her wealth but is betrayed by her treasurer, who claims she is holding treasure back. Octavius reassures her that he is not interested in her wealth, but Dolabella warns her that he intends to parade her at his [[Roman triumph|triumph]].

[[Death of Cleopatra|Cleopatra kills herself]] using the [[Venomous snake|venomous]] [[Snakebite|bite]] of an [[asp (reptile)|asp]], imagining how she will meet Antony again in the afterlife. Her serving maids Iras and Charmian also die, Iras from heartbreak and Charmian from another asp. Octavius discovers the dead bodies and experiences conflicting emotions. Antony's and Cleopatra's deaths leave him free to become the first [[Roman emperor|Roman Emperor]], but he also feels some sympathy for them. He orders a public military funeral.

The principal source for the story is an English translation of Plutarch's "Life of Mark Antony," from the ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans Compared Together]]''. This [https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/norths-translation-of-plutarchs-lives translation], by [[Sir Thomas North]], was first published in 1579. Many phrases in Shakespeare's play are taken directly from North, including Enobarbus' famous description of Cleopatra and her barge:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
I will tell you.
The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;
Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
The water which they beat to follow faster,
As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
It beggar'd all description: she did lie
In her pavilion—cloth-of-gold of tissue—
O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
The fancy outwork nature: on each side her
Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
And what they undid did.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

This may be compared with North's text:

{{quote|"Therefore when she was sent unto by diverse letters, both from Antonius himselfe, and also from his friends, she made so light of it and mocked Antonius so much, that she disdained so set forward otherwise, but to take her barge in the [[Berdan River|river of Cydnus]], the poope whereof was of gold, the sailes of purple, and the oares of silver, which kept stroke in rowing after the sound of musicke of flutes, [[hautbois|howboyes]] [[cittern|cithernes]], vials and such other instruments as they played upon the barge. And now for the person of her selfe: she was layed under a pavilion of cloth of gold of tissue, apparelled and attired like the goddesse Venus, commonly drawn in picture: and hard by her, on either hand of her, pretie fair boys apparelled as painters do set foorth god Cupid, with little fans in their hands, with which they fanned wind upon her."|The Life of Marcus Antonius&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, editor: F.

However, Shakespeare also adds scenes, including many portraying Cleopatra's domestic life, and the role of Enobarbus is greatly developed. Historical facts are also changed: in Plutarch, Antony's final defeat was many weeks after the Battle of Actium, and Octavia lived with Antony for several years and bore him two children: [[Antonia Major]], paternal grandmother of the Emperor [[Nero]] and maternal grandmother of the Empress [[Valeria Messalina]], and [[Antonia Minor]], the sister-in-law of the Emperor [[Tiberius]], mother of the Emperor [[Claudius]], and paternal grandmother of the Emperor [[Caligula]] and Empress [[Agrippina the Younger]].

[[File:First Folio, Shakespeare - 0847.jpg|165px|right|thumb|The first page of ''Antony and Cleopatra'' from the [[First Folio]] of Shakespeare's plays, published in 1623.]]Many scholars believe it was written in 1606–07,{{efn|E. g., Wilders,&lt;ref name=Wilders /&gt;{{rp|p.69–75}} Miola,&lt;ref name=Miola /&gt;{{rp|p.209}} Bloom,&lt;ref name=Bloom /&gt;{{rp|p.577}} Kermode,&lt;ref name=Kermode /&gt;{{rp|p.217}} Hunter,&lt;ref name=Hunter /&gt;{{rp|p.129}} Braunmuller,&lt;ref name=Braunmuller /&gt;{{rp|p.433}} and Kennedy.&lt;ref name=Kennedy /&gt;{{rp|p.258}}}} although some researchers have argued for an earlier dating, around 1603–04.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Harbage Pelican/Viking editions of Shakespeare 1969/1977, preface.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Antony and Cleopatra'' was entered in the [[Stationers' Register]] (an early form of [[copyright]] for printed works) in May 1608, but it does not seem to have been actually printed until the publication of the First Folio in 1623. The Folio is therefore the only authoritative text we have today. Some scholars speculate that it derives from Shakespeare's own draft, or "foul papers", since it contains minor errors in speech labels and stage directions that are thought to be characteristic of the author in the process of composition.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Stanley, and Gary Taylor. ''William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987: 549 {{ISBN|039331667X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern editions divide the play into a conventional five-act structure but, as in most of his earlier plays, Shakespeare did not create these act divisions. His play is articulated in forty separate "scenes", more than he used for any other play. Even the word "scenes" may be inappropriate as a description, as the scene changes are often very fluid, almost [[Montage sequence|montage]]-like. The large number of scenes is necessary because the action frequently switches between Alexandria, Italy, [[Messina]] in Sicily, Syria, [[Athens]], and other parts of Egypt and the Roman Republic. The play contains thirty-four speaking characters, fairly typical for a Shakespeare play on such an epic scale.

== Analysis and criticism ==

=== Classical allusions and analogues: Dido and Aeneas from Virgil's ''Aeneid'' ===

Many critics have noted the strong influence of [[Virgil]]'s first-century Roman epic poem, the ''[[Aeneid]]'', on Shakespeare's ''Antony and Cleopatra''. Such influence should be expected, given the prevalence of allusions to Virgil in the Renaissance culture in which Shakespeare was educated. Moreover, as is well-known, the historical Antony and Cleopatra were the prototypes and antitypes for Virgil's Dido and Aeneas: [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]], ruler of the north African city of [[Carthage]], tempts [[Aeneas]], the legendary exemplar of Roman ''[[pietas]]'', to forego his task of founding Rome after the fall of [[Troy]]. The fictional Aeneas dutifully resists Dido's temptation and abandons her to forge on to Italy, placing political destiny before romantic love, in stark contrast to Antony, who puts passionate love of his own Egyptian queen, Cleopatra, before duty to Rome.{{efn|On the historical political context of the Aeneid and its larger influence on the Western literary tradition through the seventeenth century, see {{cite book |first=David |last=Quint |title=Epic and Empire: Politics and Generic Form from Virgil to Milton |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0691069425 }} }} Given the well-established traditional connections between the fictional Dido and Aeneas and the historical Antony and Cleopatra, it is no surprise that Shakespeare includes numerous allusions to Virgil's epic in his historical tragedy. As Janet Adelman observes, "almost all the central elements in ''Antony and Cleopatra'' are to be found in the ''Aeneid'': the opposing values of Rome and a foreign passion; the political necessity of a passionless Roman marriage; the concept of an afterlife in which the passionate lovers meet."&lt;ref&gt;Janet Adelman, "Tradition as Source in ''Antony and Cleopatra''", from ''The Common Liar: an Essay on'' Antony and Cleopatra (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1973), reprinted in ''Antony and Cleopatra: A Norton Critical Edition'', ed. Ania Loomba (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 2011): 183.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Heather James argues, Shakespeare's allusions to Virgil's Dido and Aeneas are far from slavish imitations. James emphasizes the various ways in which Shakespeare's play subverts the ideology of the Virgilian tradition; one such instance of this subversion is Cleopatra's dream of Antony in Act 5 ("I dreamt there was an Emperor Antony" [5.2.75]). James argues that in her extended description of this dream, Cleopatra "reconstructs the heroic masculinity of an Antony whose identity has been fragmented and scattered by Roman opinion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Heather |last=James |title=Shakespeare's Troy: Drama, Politics and the Translation of Empire |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |page=145 |isbn=0521033780 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This politically charged dream vision is just one example of the way that Shakespeare's story destabilises and potentially critiques the Roman ideology inherited from Virgil's epic and embodied in the mythic Roman ancestor Aeneas.

Cleopatra, being the complex figure that she is, has faced a variety of interpretations of character throughout history. Perhaps the most famous dichotomy is that of the manipulative seductress versus the skilled leader. Examining the critical history of the character of Cleopatra reveals that intellectuals of the 19th century and the early 20th century viewed her as merely an object of sexuality that could be understood and diminished rather than an imposing force with great poise and capacity for leadership.

This phenomenon is illustrated by the famous poet [[T.S. Eliot]]'s take on Cleopatra. He saw her as "no wielder of power," but rather that her "devouring sexuality...diminishes her power".&lt;ref name=McC /&gt; His language and writings use images of darkness, desire, beauty, sensuality, and carnality to portray not a strong, powerful woman, but a temptress. Throughout his writing on Antony and Cleopatra, Eliot refers to Cleopatra as material rather than person. He frequently calls her "thing". T.S. Eliot conveys the view of early critical history on the character of Cleopatra.

Other scholars also discuss early critics' views of Cleopatra in relation to a serpent signifying "[[original sin]]".&lt;ref name=Jim /&gt;{{rp|p.12}} The symbol of the serpent "functions, at the symbolic level, as a means of her submission, the phallic appropriation of the queen's body (and the land it embodies) by Octavius and the empire".&lt;ref name=Jim /&gt;{{rp|p.13}} The serpent, because it represents temptation, sin, and feminine weakness, is used by 19th and early 20th century critics to undermine Cleopatra's political authority and to emphasise the image of Cleopatra as manipulative seductress.

The [[postmodern]] view of Cleopatra is complex. Doris Adler suggests that, in a postmodern philosophical sense, we cannot begin to grasp the character of Cleopatra because, "In a sense it is a distortion to consider Cleopatra at any moment apart from the entire cultural milieu that creates and consumes Antony and Cleopatra on stage. However the isolation and microscopic examination of a single aspect apart from its host environment is an effort to improve the understanding of the broader context. In similar fashion, the isolation and examination of the stage image of Cleopatra becomes an attempt to improve the understanding of the theatrical power of her infinite variety and the cultural treatment of that power."&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; So, as a microcosm, Cleopatra can be understood within a postmodern context, as long as one understands that the purpose for the examination of this microcosm is to further one's own interpretation of the work as a whole. Author L.T. Fitz believes that it is not possible to derive a clear, postmodern view of Cleopatra due to the sexism that all critics bring with them when they review her intricate character. He states specifically, "Almost all critical approaches to this play have been coloured by the sexist assumptions the critics have brought with them to their reading."&lt;ref name=Fitz /&gt;  One seemingly anti-sexist viewpoint comes from Donald C. Freeman's articulations of the meaning and significance of the deaths of both Antony and Cleopatra at the end of the play. Freeman states, "We understand Antony as a grand failure because the container of his Romanness "dislimns": it can no longer outline and define him even to himself. Conversely, we understand Cleopatra at her death as the transcendent queen of "immortal longings" because the container of her mortality can no longer restrain her: unlike Antony, she never melts, but sublimates from her very earthly flesh to ethereal fire and air."&lt;ref name=Freeman /&gt;

Some postmodern critics also believe that the view of Cleopatra is constantly shifting and can be interpreted in many new and sometimes exciting ways. Francesca T. Royster suggests that contemporary interpretations of Cleopatra consider her African-American traits: "Cleopatra has 'soul'—she provides the proof that there is a locatable black aesthetic transcendent of time and place."&lt;ref&gt;Royster, Francesca T. ''Becoming Cleopatra: The Shifting Image of an Icon''. New York City: Palgrave MacMillan, 2003. {{ISBN|1403961093}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These constant shifts in the perception of Cleopatra are well represented in a review of [[Estelle Parsons]]' adaptation of Shakespeare's ''Antony and Cleopatra'' at the Interart Theatre in New York City. Arthur Holmberg surmises, "What had at first seemed like a desperate attempt to be chic in a trendy New York manner was, in fact, an ingenious way to characterise the differences between Antony's Rome and Cleopatra's Egypt. Most productions rely on rather predictable contrasts in costuming to imply the rigid discipline of the former and the languid self-indulgence of the latter. By exploiting ethnic differences in speech, gesture, and movement, Parsons rendered the clash between two opposing cultures not only contemporary but also poignant. In this setting, the white Egyptians represented a graceful and ancient aristocracy—well groomed, elegantly poised, and doomed. The Romans, upstarts from the West, lacked finesse and polish. But by sheer brute strength they would hold dominion over principalities and kingdoms."&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; This assessment of the changing way in which Cleopatra is represented in modern adaptations of Shakespeare's play is yet another example of how the modern and postmodern view of Cleopatra is constantly evolving.

Cleopatra is a difficult character to pin down because there are multiple aspects of her personality that we occasionally get a glimpse of. However, the most dominant parts of her character seem to oscillate between a powerful ruler, a seductress, and a heroine of sorts. Power is one of Cleopatra's most dominant character traits and she uses it as a means of control. This thirst for control manifested itself through Cleopatra's initial seduction of Antony in which she was dressed as Aphrodite, the goddess of love, and made quite a calculated entrance in order to capture his attention.&lt;ref&gt;"Cleopatra: The Woman Behind the Name". Tour Egypt. Web. 28 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This sexualised act extends itself into Cleopatra's role as a seductress because it was her courage and unapologetic manner that leaves people remembering her as a "grasping, licentious harlot".&lt;ref name="Lustful Seductress. Wfu. Web"&gt;"Lustful Seductress". Wfu. Web&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite her "insatiable sexual passion" she was still using these relationships as part of a grander political scheme, once again revealing how dominant Cleopatra's desire was for power.&lt;ref name="Lustful Seductress. Wfu. Web"/&gt; Due to Cleopatra's close relationship with power, she seems to take on the role of a heroine because there is something in her passion and intelligence that intrigues others.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Dolora. "The Characterization of Shakespeare's Cleopatra." Shakespeare Quarterly. 6.1 (1955). 9–17. Web&lt;/ref&gt; She was an autonomous and confident ruler, sending a powerful message about the independence and strength of women. Cleopatra had quite a wide influence, and still continues to inspire, making her a heroine to many.

=== Structure: Egypt and Rome ===

[[File:Cleopatra greets Antony.jpg|thumb|A drawing by Faulkner of Cleopatra greeting Antony]]
The relationship between Egypt and Rome in ''Antony and Cleopatra'' is central to understanding the plot, as the dichotomy allows the reader to gain more insight into the characters, their relationships, and the ongoing events that occur throughout the play. Shakespeare emphasises the differences between the two nations with his use of language and literary devices, which also highlight the different characterizations of the two countries by their own inhabitants and visitors. Literary critics have also spent many years developing arguments concerning the "masculinity" of Rome and the Romans and the "femininity" of Egypt and the Egyptians. In traditional criticism of ''Antony and Cleopatra'', "Rome has been characterised as a male world, presided over by the austere Caesar, and Egypt as a female domain, embodied by a Cleopatra who is seen to be as abundant, leaky, and changeable as the Nile".&lt;ref name=Harris /&gt; In such a reading, male and female, Rome and Egypt, reason and emotion, and austerity and leisure are treated as mutually exclusive binaries that all interrelate with one another. The straightforwardness of the binary between male Rome and female Egypt has been challenged in later 20th-century criticism of the play: "In the wake of feminist, poststructuralist, and cultural-materialist critiques of gender essentialism, most modern Shakespeare scholars are inclined to be far more skeptical about claims that Shakespeare possessed a unique insight into a timeless 'femininity'."&lt;ref name=Harris /&gt; As a result, critics have been much more likely in recent years to describe Cleopatra as a character that confuses or deconstructs gender than as a character that embodies the feminine.&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt;

==== Literary devices used to convey the differences between Rome and Egypt ====

In ''Antony and Cleopatra'', Shakespeare uses several literary techniques to convey a deeper meaning about the differences between Rome and Egypt. One example of this is his schema of the container as suggested by critic Donald Freeman in his article, "The rack dislimns." In his article, Freeman suggests that the container is representative of the body and the overall theme of the play that "knowing is seeing."&lt;ref name=Freeman /&gt; In literary terms a schema refers to a plan throughout the work, which means that Shakespeare had a set path for unveiling the meaning of the "container" to the audience within the play. An example of the body in reference to the container can be seen in the following passage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Nay, but this dotage of our general's
O'erflows the measure . . .
His captain's heart,
Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper
And is become the bellows and the fan
To cool a gypsy's lust. (1.1.1–2, 6–10)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The lack of tolerance exerted by the hard-edged Roman military code allots to a general's dalliance is metaphorised as a container, a measuring cup that cannot hold the liquid of Antony's grand passion.&lt;ref name=Freeman /&gt; Later we also see Antony's heart-container swells again because it "o'erflows the measure." For Antony, the container of the Rome-world is confining and a "measure," while the container of the Egypt-world is liberating, an ample domain where he can explore.&lt;ref name=Freeman /&gt; The contrast between the two is expressed in two of the play's famous speeches:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space!
Kingdoms are clay!
(1.1.34–36)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Rome to "melt is for it to lose its defining shape, the boundary that contains its civic and military codes.&lt;ref name=Freeman /&gt; This schema is important in understanding Antony's grand failure because the Roman container can no longer outline or define him—even to himself. Conversely we come to understand Cleopatra in that the container of her mortality can no longer restrain her. Unlike Antony whose container melts, she gains a sublimity being released into the air.&lt;ref name=Freeman /&gt;

In her article "Roman World, Egyptian Earth", critic Mary Thomas Crane introduces another symbol throughout the play: The [[classical element#Classical elements in Greece|four elements]]. In general, characters associated with Egypt perceive their world composed of the Aristotelian elements, which are earth, wind, fire and water. For [[Aristotle]] these physical elements were the centre of the universe and appropriately Cleopatra heralds her coming death when she proclaims, "I am fire and air; my other elements/I give to baser life," (5.2.289-90).&lt;ref name=Crane /&gt;  Romans, on the other hand, seem to have left behind that system, replacing it with a subjectivity separated from and overlooking the natural world and imagining itself as able to control it. These differing systems of thought and perception result in very different versions of nation and empire. Shakespeare's relatively positive representation of Egypt has sometimes been read as nostalgia for an heroic past. Because the [[Aristotle#Physics|Aristotelian elements]] were a declining theory in Shakespeare's time, it can also be read as nostalgia for a waning theory of the material world, the pre-seventeenth-century cosmos of elements and [[Humorism|humours]] that rendered subject and world deeply interconnected and saturated with meaning.&lt;ref name=Crane /&gt; Thus this reflects the difference between the Egyptians who are interconnected with the elemental earth and the Romans in their dominating the hard-surfaced, impervious world.

Critics also suggest that the political attitudes of the main characters are an [[allegory]] for the political atmosphere of Shakespeare's time. According to Paul Lawrence Rose in his article "The Politics of ''Antony and Cleopatra''", the views expressed in the play of "national solidarity, social order and strong rule"&lt;ref name=Politics /&gt; were familiar after the [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]] of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and the political disaster involving [[Mary Queen of Scots]]. Essentially the political themes throughout the play are reflective of the different models of rule during Shakespeare's time. The political attitudes of Antony, Caesar, and Cleopatra are all basic archetypes for the conflicting sixteenth-century views of kingship.&lt;ref name=Politics /&gt; Caesar is representative of the ideal king, who brings about the [[Pax Romana]] similar to the political peace established under [[Tudor dynasty|the Tudors]]. His cold demeanour is representative of what the sixteenth century thought to be a side-effect of political genius&lt;ref name=Politics /&gt; Conversely, Antony's focus is on valour and [[chivalry]], and Antony views the political power of victory as a by-product of both. Cleopatra's power has been described as "naked, hereditary, and despotic,"&lt;ref name=Politics /&gt; and it is argued that she is reminiscent of [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor's]] reign—implying it is not coincidence that she brings about the "doom of Egypt." This is in part due to an emotional comparison in their rule. Cleopatra, who was emotionally invested in Antony, brought about the downfall of Egypt in her commitment to love, whereas Mary Tudor's emotional attachment to [[Catholicism]] fates her rule. The political implications within the play reflect on Shakespeare's England in its message that Impact is not a match for Reason.&lt;ref name=Politics /&gt;

==== The characterization of Rome and Egypt ====

Critics have often used the opposition between Rome and Egypt in ''Antony and Cleopatra'' to set forth defining characteristics of the various characters. While some characters are distinctly Egyptian, others are distinctly Roman, some are torn between the two, and still others attempt to remain neutral.&lt;ref name=Hirsh /&gt; Critic James Hirsh has stated that, "as a result, the play dramatises not two but four main figurative locales: Rome as it is perceived from a Roman point of view; Rome as it is perceived from an Egyptian point of view; Egypt as it is perceived form a Roman point of view; and Egypt as it is perceived from an Egyptian point of view."&lt;ref name=Hirsh /&gt;{{rp|p.175}}

'''Rome from the Roman perspective:''' According to Hirsh, Rome largely defines itself by its opposition to Egypt.&lt;ref name=Hirsh/&gt;{{rp|p.167–77}} Where Rome is viewed as structured, moral, mature, and essentially masculine, Egypt is the polar opposite; chaotic, immoral, immature, and feminine. In fact, even the distinction between masculine and feminine is a purely Roman idea which the Egyptians largely ignore. The Romans view the "world" as nothing more than something for them to conquer and control. They believe they are "impervious to environmental influence"&lt;ref name=Crane/&gt; and that they are not to be influenced and controlled by the world but vice versa.

'''Rome from the Egyptian perspective:''' The Egyptians view the Romans as boring, oppressive, strict and lacking in passion and creativity, preferring strict rules and regulations.&lt;ref name=Hirsh/&gt;{{rp|p.177}}

'''Egypt from the Egyptian perspective:''' The Egyptian World view reflects what Mary Floyd-Wilson has called geo-humoralism, or the belief that climate and other environmental factors shapes racial character.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd-Wilson, Mary. ''English Ethnicity and Race in Early Modern Drama''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003. 1–2. {{ISBN|0521810566}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptians view themselves as deeply entwined with the natural "earth". Egypt is not a location for them to rule over, but an inextricable part of them. Cleopatra envisions herself as the embodiment of Egypt because she has been nurtured and moulded by the environment&lt;ref name=Crane/&gt; fed by "the dung, / the beggar's nurse and Caesar's" (5.2.7–8). They view life as more fluid and less structured allowing for creativity and passionate pursuits.

'''Egypt from the Roman perspective:''' The Romans view the Egyptians essentially as improper. Their passion for life is continuously viewed as irresponsible, indulgent, over-sexualised and disorderly.&lt;ref name=Hirsh/&gt;{{rp|p.176–77}} The Romans view Egypt as a distraction that can send even the best men off course. This is demonstrated in the following passage describing Antony.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Boys who, being mature in knowledge,
Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
And so rebel judgment.
(1.4.31–33)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ultimately the dichotomy between Rome and Egypt is used to distinguish two sets of conflicting values between two different locales. Yet, it goes beyond this division to show the conflicting sets of values not only between two cultures but within cultures, even within individuals.&lt;ref name=Hirsh /&gt;{{rp|p.180}} As John Gillies has argued "the 'orientalism' of Cleopatra's court—with its luxury, decadence, splendour, sensuality, appetite, effeminacy and eunuchs—seems a systematic inversion of the legendary Roman values of temperance, manliness, courage".&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, John. Shakespeare and the Geography of Difference. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994. 118. {{ISBN|0521458536}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While some characters fall completely into the category of Roman or Egyptian (Octavius as Roman, Cleopatra Egyptian) others, such as Antony, cannot chose between the two conflicting locales and cultures. Instead he oscillates between the two. In the beginning of the play Cleopatra calls attention to this saying

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
He was dispos'd to mirth, but on the sudden
A Roman thought hath strook him.
(1.2.82–83)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This shows Antony's willingness to embrace the pleasures of Egyptian life, yet his tendency to still be drawn back into Roman thoughts and ideas.

Orientalism plays a very specific, and yet, nuanced role in the story of Antony and Cleopatra. A more specific term comes to mind, from Richmond Barbour, that of proto-orientalism, that is orientalism before the age of imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Richmond. Before Orientalism: London's Theatre of the East 1576–1626. Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge UP, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This puts Antony and Cleopatra in an interesting period of time, one that existed before the West knew much about what would eventually be called the Orient, but still a time where it was known that there were lands beyond Europe. This allowed Shakespeare to use widespread assumptions about the "exotic" east with little academic recourse. It could be said that Antony and Cleopatra and their relationship represent the first meeting of the two cultures in a literary sense, and that this relationship would lay the foundation for the idea of Western superiority vs. Eastern inferiority.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Dabbagh, Abdulla. Literary Orientalism, Postcolonialism, and Universalism. New York: Peter Lang, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The case could also be made that at least in a literary sense, the relationship between Antony and Cleopatra was some people's first exposure to an inter-racial relationship, and in a major way. This plays into the idea that Cleopatra has been made out to be an "other", with terms used to describe her like "gypsy".&lt;ref&gt;Crane, Mary Thomas. "Roman World, Egyptian Earth: Cognitive Difference and Empire in Shakespeare's ''Antony and Cleopatra''". Comparative Drama 43.1 (2009): 1–17. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; And it is this otherization that is at the heart of the piece itself, the idea that Antony, a man of Western origin and upbringing has coupled himself with the Eastern women, the stereotypical "other".&lt;ref&gt;Gajowski, Evelyn. The Art of Loving: Female Subjectivity and Male Discursive Traditions in Shakespeare's Tragedies. Newark: University of Delaware, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The changing views of critics regarding gender characterization of Egypt and Rome ====
[[File:011-Mark Antony, with Cleopatra VII -3.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[denarius]] minted in 32 BC; on the [[obverse]] is a [[diadem]]ed portrait of Cleopatra, with the [[Latin]] inscription "CLEOPATRA[E REGINAE REGVM]FILIORVM REGVM", and on the reverse a portrait of [[Mark Antony]] with the inscription reading "ANTONI ARMENIA DEVICTA".]]

Feminist criticism of ''Antony and Cleopatra'' has provided a more in-depth reading of the play, has challenged previous norms for criticism, and has opened a larger discussion of the characterization of Egypt and Rome. However, as Gayle Greene so aptly recognises, it must be addressed that "feminist criticism [of Shakespeare] is nearly as concerned with the biases of Shakespeare's interpretors {{sic}} – critics, directors, editors – as with Shakespeare himself."&lt;ref name=Green /&gt;

Feminist scholars, in respect to ''Antony and Cleopatra'', often examine Shakespeare's use of language when describing Rome and Egypt. Through his language, such scholars argue, he tends to characterise Rome as "masculine" and Egypt as "feminine." According to Gayle Greene, "the 'feminine' world of love and personal relationships is secondary to the 'masculine' world of war and politics, [and] has kept us from realizing that Cleopatra is the play's protagonist, and so skewed our perceptions of character, theme, and structure."&lt;ref name=Green /&gt; The highlighting of these starkly contrasting qualities of the two backdrops of ''Antony and Cleopatra'', in both Shakespeare's language and the words of critics, brings attention to the characterization of the title characters, since their respective countries are meant to represent and emphasise their attributes.

The feminine categorization of Egypt, and subsequently Cleopatra, was negatively portrayed throughout early criticism. The story of ''Antony and Cleopatra'' was often summarised as either "the fall of a great general, betrayed in his dotage by a treacherous strumpet, or else it can be viewed as a celebration of transcendental love."&lt;ref name=Fitz /&gt;{{rp|p.297}} In both reduced summaries, Egypt and Cleopatra are presented as either the destruction of Antony's masculinity and greatness or as agents in a love story. Once the Women's Liberation Movement grew between the 1960s and 1980s, however, critics began to take a closer look at both Shakespeare's characterization of Egypt and Cleopatra and the work and opinions of other critics on the same matter.

Jonathan Gil Harris claims that the Egypt vs. Rome dichotomy many critics often adopt does not only represent a "gender polarity" but also a "gender hierarchy".&lt;ref name=Harris /&gt;{{rp|p.409}} Critical approaches to ''Antony and Cleopatra'' from the beginning of the 20th century mostly adopt a reading that places Rome as higher in the hierarchy than Egypt. Early critics like Georg Brandes presented Egypt as a lesser nation because of its lack of rigidity and structure and presented Cleopatra, negatively, as "the woman of women, quintessentiated Eve."&lt;ref&gt;Georg Brandes, ''William Shakespeare. A Critical Study'', trans. William Archer and Diana White (New York: F. Unger, 1963): 144&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt and Cleopatra are both represented by Brandes as uncontrollable because of their connection with the Nile River and Cleopatra's "infinite variety" (2.2.236).

In more recent years, critics have taken a closer look at previous readings of ''Antony and Cleopatra'' and have found several aspects overlooked. Egypt was previously characterised as the nation of the feminine attributes of lust and desire while Rome was more controlled. However, Harris points out that Caesar and Antony both possess an uncontrollable desire for Egypt and Cleopatra: Caesar's is political while Antony's is personal. Harris further implies that Romans have an uncontrollable lust and desire for "what they do not or cannot have."&lt;ref name=Harris /&gt;{{rp|p.415}} For example, Antony only desires his wife Fulvia after she is dead:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:
What our contempt doth often hurl from us,
We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
By revolution lowering, does become
The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone:
The hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on.
(1.2.119-24)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this way, Harris is suggesting that Rome is no higher on any "gender hierarchy" than Egypt.

L. T. Fitz outwardly claims that early criticism of ''Antony and Cleopatra'' is "colored by the sexist assumptions the critics have brought with them to their reading."&lt;ref name=Fitz /&gt;{{rp|p.297}} Fitz argues that previous criticisms place a heavy emphasis on Cleopatra's "wicked and manipulative" ways, which are further emphasised by her association with Egypt and her contrast to the "chaste and submissive" Roman Octavia.&lt;ref name=Fitz /&gt;{{rp|p.301}} Finally, Fitz emphasises the tendency of early critics to assert that Antony is the sole protagonist of the play. This claim is apparent in Brandes argument: "when [Antony] perishes, a prey to the voluptuousness of the East, it seems as though Roman greatness and the Roman Republic expires with him."&lt;ref&gt;Georg Brandes, ''William Shakespeare. A Critical Study'', trans. William Archer and Diana White (New York: F. Unger, 1963): 158&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Fitz points out that Antony dies in Act IV while Cleopatra (and therefore Egypt) is present throughout Act V until she commits suicide at the end and "would seem to fulfill at least the formal requirements of the tragic hero."&lt;ref name=Fitz /&gt;{{rp|p.310}}

These criticisms are only a few examples of how the critical views of Egypt's "femininity" and Rome's "masculinity" have changed over time and how the development of feminist theory has helped in widening the discussion.

=== Themes and motifs ===

==== Ambiguity and opposition ====

Relativity and ambiguity are prominent ideas in the play, and the audience is challenged to come to conclusions about the ambivalent nature of many of the characters. The relationship between Antony and Cleopatra can easily be read as one of love or lust; their passion can be construed as being wholly destructive but also showing elements of transcendence. Cleopatra might be said to kill herself out of love for Antony, or because she has lost political power.&lt;ref name=Neill /&gt;{{rp|p.127}} Octavius can be seen as either a noble and good ruler, only wanting what is right for Rome, or as a cruel and ruthless politician.

A major theme running through the play is opposition. Throughout the play, oppositions between Rome and Egypt, love and lust, and masculinity and femininity are emphasised, subverted, and commented on. One of Shakespeare's most famous speeches, drawn almost verbatim from [[Sir Thomas North|North]]'s translation of Plutarch's ''Lives'', Enobarbus' description of Cleopatra on her barge, is full of opposites resolved into a single meaning, corresponding with these wider oppositions that characterise the rest of the play:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
'''Burn'd on the water'''...
...she did lie
In her pavilion—cloth-of-gold of tissue—
O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
The ''' fancy outwork nature''': on each side her
Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
With divers-colour'd fans, '''whose wind did seem'''
'''To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,'''
'''And what they undid did'''. (Act 2, Scene 2)&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cleopatra herself sees Antony as both the [[Gorgon]] and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] (Act 2 Scene 5, lines 118-19).

=====Theme of ambivalence=====

The play is accurately structured with paradox and ambivalence in order to convey the antitheses that make Shakespeare's work remarkable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Bevington |first= David|title=Antony and Cleopatra (The New Cambridge Shakespeare)|publisher=Cambridge UP}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ambivalence in this play is the contrasting response of one's own character. It may be perceived as opposition between word and deed but not  to be confused with "duality." For example, after Antony abandons his army during the sea battle to follow Cleopatra, he expresses his remorse and pain in his famous speech: 
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
All is lost;  
This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me:  
My fleet hath yielded to the foe; and yonder
They cast their caps up and carouse together  
Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore!  'tis thou  
Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart  
Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
For when I am revenged upon my charm, 
I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone. [Exit SCARUS]  
O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more:  
Fortune and Antony part here; even here
Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts  
That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave  
Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets  
On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd, 
That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am:
O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,—  
Whose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home;  
Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,—  
Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose, 
Beguiled me to the very heart of loss.
What, Eros, Eros!  [Enter CLEOPATRA]  Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!&lt;ref name="Shakespeare"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shakespeare|first=William|title=Antony and Cleopatra}}&lt;/ref&gt; (IV.12.2913–2938)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, he then strangely says to Cleopatra: "All that is won and lost. Give me a kiss. Even this repays me"&lt;ref name="Shakespeare"/&gt;(3.12.69–70). Antony's speech conveys pain and anger, but he acts in opposition to his emotions and words, all for the love of Cleopatra. Literary critic Joyce Carol Oates explains: "Antony's agony is curiously muted for someone who has achieved and lost so much." This irony gap between word and deed of the characters results in a theme of ambivalence. Moreover, due to the flow of constant changing emotions throughout the play: "the characters do not know each other, nor can we know them, any more clearly than we know ourselves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Bloom|first=Harold|title=William Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra|publisher=Chelsea House}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is believed by critics that opposition is what makes good fiction. Another example of ambivalence in ''Antony and Cleopatra'' is in the opening act of the play when Cleopatra asks Anthony: "Tell me how much you love." Prominent professor at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Tzachi Zamir, points out: "The persistence of doubt is in perpetual tension with the opposing need for certainty" and he refers to the persistence of doubt that derives from the contradiction of word and deed in the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Shapiro|first=S. A|title=The Varying Shore of The World Ambivalence in Antony and Cleopatra|publisher=Modern Language Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Betrayal ====

Betrayal is a recurring theme throughout the play. At one time or another, almost every character betrays their country, ethics, or a companion. However, certain characters waver between betrayal and loyalty. This struggle is most apparent among the actions of Cleopatra, Enobarbus, and most importantly Antony. Antony mends ties with his Roman roots and alliance with Caesar by entering into a marriage with Octavia, however he returns to Cleopatra. Historian Diana E. E. Kleiner points out "Anthony's perceived betrayal of Rome was greeted with public calls for war with Egypt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Diana E.E|title=Cleopatra and Rome|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he vows to remain loyal in his marriage, his impulses and unfaithfulness with his Roman roots is what ultimately leads to war. It is twice Cleopatra abandons Antony during battle and whether out of fear or political motives, she deceived Antony. When Thidias, Caesar's messenger, tells Cleopatra Caesar will show her mercy if she will relinquish Antony, she is quick to respond:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
"Most kind messenger,
Say to great Caesar this in deputation:
I kiss his conqu'ring hand. Tell him I am prompt
To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel."&lt;ref name="Shakespeare"/&gt; (III.13.75–79)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shakespeare critic Sara Deats says Cleopatras betrayal fell "on the successful fencing with Octavius that leaves her to be "noble to [herself]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deats|first=Sara|title=Shakespeare Criticism: Antony and Cleopatra: New Critical Essays|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she quickly reconciles with Antony, reaffirming her loyalty towards him and never truly submitting to Caesar. 
Enobarbus, Antony's most devoted friend, betrays Antony when he deserts him in favour for Caesar. He exclaims, "I fight against thee! / No: I will go seek some ditch wherein to die"&lt;ref name="Shakespeare"/&gt; (IV. 6. 38–39). Although he abandoned Antony, critic Kent Cartwright claims Enobarbus' death "uncovers his greater love" for him considering it was caused by the guilt of what he had done to his friend thus adding to the confusion of the characters' loyalty and betrayal that previous critics have also discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cartwright|first=Kent|title=Shakespearean Tragedy and Its Double: The Rhythms of Audience   Response|year=2010|publisher=Penn State Press|location=University Park}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though loyalty is central to secure alliances, Shakespeare is making a point with the theme of betrayal by exposing how people in power cannot be trusted, no matter how honest their word may seem. The characters' loyalty and validity of promises are constantly called into question. The perpetual swaying between alliances strengthens the ambiguity and uncertainty amid the characters loyalty and disloyalty.

==== Power dynamics ====
[[File:M Antonius.jpg|thumb|A [[Roman sculpture|Roman bust]] of the [[Roman consul|consul]] and [[triumvir]] [[Mark Antony]], [[Vatican Museums]]]]

As a play concerning the relationship between two empires, the presence of a power dynamic is apparent and becomes a recurring theme. Antony and Cleopatra battle over this dynamic as heads of state, yet the theme of power also resonates in their romantic relationship. The Roman ideal of power lies in a political nature taking a base in economical control.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt; As an imperialist power, Rome takes its power in the ability to change the world.&lt;ref name=Crane /&gt; As a Roman man, Antony is expected to fulfill certain qualities pertaining to his Roman masculine power, especially in the war arena and in his duty as a soldier:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Those his goodly eyes,
That o'er the files and musters of the war
Have glowed like plated mars, now bend, now turn
The office and devotion of their view
Upon a tawny front. His captain's heart,
Which in the scuffles of greatness hath burst
The buckles on his breast, reneges all tempers,
And is becomes the bellows and the fan
To cool a gipsy's lust.&lt;ref&gt;''Antony and Cleopatra'', I.1.2–10&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cleopatra's character is slightly unpin-able, as her character identity retains a certain aspect of mystery. She embodies the mystical, exotic, and dangerous nature of Egypt as the "serpent of old Nile".&lt;ref name=Crane /&gt; Critic Lisa Starks says that "Cleopatra [comes] to signify the double-image of the "temptress/goddess".&lt;ref name=Starks /&gt; She is continually described in an unearthly nature which extends to her description as the goddess Venus.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
...For her own person,
It beggared all description. She did lie
In her pavilion—cloth of gold, of tissue—
O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
The fancy outwork nature.&lt;ref&gt;''Antony and Cleopatra'' II.2.203-7&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This mysteriousness attached with the supernatural not only captures the audience and Antony, but also, draws all other characters' focus. As a center of conversation when not present in the scene, Cleopatra is continually a central point, therefore demanding the control of the stage.&lt;ref name=Pal /&gt;{{rp|p.605}} As an object of sexual desire, she is attached to the Roman need to conquer.&lt;ref name=Starks /&gt; Her mix of sexual prowess with the political power is a threat to Roman politics. She retains her heavy involvement in the military aspect of her rule, especially when she asserts herself as "the president of [her] kingdom will/ Appear there for a man."&lt;ref&gt;''Antony and Cleopatra'' III.7.37–38&lt;/ref&gt; Where the dominating power lies is up for interpretation, yet there are several mentions of the power exchange in their relationship in the text. Antony remarks on Cleopatra's power over him multiple times throughout the play, the most obvious being attached to sexual innuendo: "You did know / How much you were my conqueror, and that / My sword, made weak by my affection, would / Obey it on all cause."&lt;ref&gt;''Antony and Cleopatra'' III.11.65-8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Use of language in power dynamics'''

Manipulation and the quest for power are very prominent themes not only in the play but specifically in the relationship between Antony and Cleopatra. Both utilise language to undermine the power of the other and to heighten their own sense of power.

Cleopatra uses language to undermine Antony's assumed authority over her. Cleopatra's "'Roman' language of command works to undermine Antony's authority."&lt;ref name=r3/&gt; By using a Romanesque rhetoric, Cleopatra commands Antony and others in Antony's own style. In their first exchange in Act I, scene 1, Cleopatra says to Antony, "I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved."&lt;ref&gt;''Antony and Cleopatra'' I.1.16&lt;/ref&gt; In this case Cleopatra speaks in an authoritative and affirming sense to her lover, which to Shakespeare's audience would be uncharacteristic for a female lover.

Antony's language suggests his struggle for power against Cleopatra's dominion. Antony's "obsessive language concerned with structure, organization, and maintenance for the self and empire in repeated references to 'measure,' 'property,' and 'rule' express unconscious anxieties about boundary integrity and violation." (Hooks 38)&lt;ref name=r10/&gt; Furthermore, Antony struggles with his infatuation with Cleopatra and this paired with Cleopatra's desire for power over him causes his eventual downfall. He states in Act I, scene 2, "These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,/Or lose myself in dotage."&lt;ref&gt;''Antony and Cleopatra'' I.2.105–106&lt;/ref&gt; Antony feels restrained by "Egyptian fetters" indicating that he recognises Cleopatra's control over him. He also mentions losing himself in dotage – "himself" referring to Antony as Roman ruler and authority over people including Cleopatra.

Cleopatra also succeeds in causing Antony to speak in a more theatrical sense and therefore undermine his own true authority. In Act I, scene 1, Antony not only speaks again of his empire but constructs a theatrical image: "Let Rome and Tiber melt, and the wide arch/Of the ranged empire fall... The nobleness of life/Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair/And such a twain can do't – in which I bind/On pain of punishment the world to weet/We stand up peerless."&lt;ref&gt;''Antony and Cleopatra'' I.1.35–42&lt;/ref&gt; Cleopatra immediately says, "Excellent falsehood!" in an [[aside]], indicating to the audience that she intends for Antony to adopt this rhetoric.

Yachnin's article focuses on Cleopatra's usurping of Antony's authority through her own and his language, while Hooks' article gives weight to Antony's attempts to assert his authority through rhetoric. Both articles indicate the lovers' awareness of each other's quests for power. Despite awareness and the political power struggle existent in the play, Antony and Cleopatra both fail to achieve their goals by the play's conclusion.

==== Performing gender and crossdressing ====

'''The performance of gender'''

''Antony and Cleopatra'' is essentially a male-dominated play in which the character of Cleopatra takes significance as one of few female figures and definitely the only strong female character. As Oriana Palusci says in her article "When Boys or Women Tell Their Dreams: Cleopatra and the Boy Actor", "Cleopatra constantly occupies the centre, if not of the stage, certainly of the discourse, often charged with sexual innuendos and disparaging tirades, of the male Roman world".&lt;ref name=Pal /&gt; We see the significance of this figure by the constant mention of her, even when she is not on stage.

What is said about Cleopatra is not always what one would normally say about a ruler; the image that is created makes the audience expect "to see on stage not a noble Sovereign, but a dark, dangerous, evil, sensual and lewd creature who has harnessed the 'captain's heart".&lt;ref name=Pal /&gt;{{rp|p.605}} This dangerously beautiful woman is difficult for Shakespeare to create because all characters, male or female, were played by men. Phyllis Rackin points out that one of the most descriptive scenes of Cleopatra is spoken by Enobarbus: "in his famous set speech, Enobarbus evokes Cleopatra's arrival on the Cynus".&lt;ref name=Rackin /&gt; It is an elaborate description that could never possibly be portrayed by a young boy actor. It is in this way that "before the boy [playing Cleopatra] can evoke Cleopatra's greatness, he must remind us that he cannot truly represent it".&lt;ref name=Rackin /&gt;{{rp|p.210}} The images of Cleopatra must be described rather than seen on stage. Rackin points out that "it is a commonplace of the older criticism that Shakespeare had to rely upon his poetry and his audience's imagination to evoke Cleopatra's greatness because he knew the boy actor could not depict it convincingly".&lt;ref name=Rackin /&gt;{{rp|p.210}}

The constant comments of the Romans about Cleopatra often undermine her, representing the Roman thought on the foreign and particularly of Egyptians. From the perspective of the reason-driven Romans, Shakespeare's "Egyptian queen repeatedly violates the rules of decorum".&lt;ref name=Rackin /&gt;{{rp|p.202}}  It is because of this distaste that Cleopatra "embodies political power, a power which is continuously underscored, denied, nullified by the Roman counterpart".&lt;ref name=Pal /&gt;{{rp|p.610}} To many of Antony's crew, his actions appeared extravagant and over the top: "Antony's devotion is inordinate and therefore irrational".&lt;ref name=Rackin /&gt;{{rp|p.210}} It is no wonder, then, that she is such a subordinated queen.

And yet she is also shown as having real power in the play. When threatened to be made a fool and fully overpowered by Octavius, she takes her own life: "She is not to be silenced by the new master, she is the one who will silence herself: 'My resolution and my hands I'll trust/ None about Caesar' (IV. 15.51–52)".&lt;ref name=Pal /&gt;{{rp|p.606–607}} From this, connections can be made between power and the performance of the female role as portrayed by Cleopatra.

'''Interpretations of crossdressing within the play'''

Scholars have speculated that Shakespeare's original intention was to have Antony appear in Cleopatra's clothes and vice versa in the beginning of the play. This possible interpretation seems to perpetuate the connections being made between gender and power. Gordon P. Jones elaborates on the importance of this detail:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Such a saturnalian exchange of costumes in the opening scene would have opened up a number of important perspectives for the play's original audience. It would immediately have established the sportiveness of the lovers. It would have provided a specific theatrical context for Cleopatra's later reminiscence about another occasion on which she "put my tires and mantles on him, whilst / I wore his sword Philippan" (II.v.22–23). It would have prepared the ground for Cleopatra's subsequent insistence on appearing "for a man" (III.vii.18) to bear a charge in the war; in doing so, it would also have prepared the audience for Antony's demeaning acquiescence in her usurpation of the male role.&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The evidence that such a costume change was intended includes Enobarbus' false identification of Cleopatra as Antony:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS: Hush! here comes Antony.
CHARMIAN: Not he; the queen.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Enobarbus could have made this error because he was used to seeing Antony in the queen's garments. It can also be speculated that Philo was referring to Antony cross-dressing in Act 1, scene 1:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
PHILO: Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,
He comes too short of that great property
Which still should go with Antony.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the context of cross-dressing, "not Antony" could mean "when Antony is dressed as Cleopatra."

If Shakespeare had indeed intended for Antony to crossdress, it would have drawn even more similarities between Antony and Hercules, a comparison that many scholars have noted many times before.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt;&lt;ref name=r6/&gt;&lt;ref name=r7/&gt; Hercules (who is said to be an ancestor of Antony) was forced to wear [[Omphale|Queen Omphale]]'s clothing while he was her indentured servant. The Omphale myth is an exploration of gender roles in Greek society. Shakespeare might have paid homage to this myth as a way of exploring gender roles in his own.&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt;{{rp|p.65}}

However, it has been noted that, while women dressing as men (i.e., a boy actor acting a female character who dresses as a man) are common in Shakespeare, the reverse (i.e., a male adult actor dressing as a woman) is all but non-existent, leaving aside Antony's debated case.

'''Critics' interpretations of boys portraying female characters'''

''Antony and Cleopatra'' also contains self-references to the crossdressing as it would have been performed historically on the London stage. For instance, in Act Five, Scene Two, Cleopatra exclaims, "Antony/ Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see/ Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness/ I'th' posture of a whore" (ll. 214–217). Many scholars interpret these lines as a [[metatheatrical]] reference to Shakespeare's own production, and by doing so comments on his own stage. Shakespeare critics such as Tracey Sedinger interpret this as Shakespeare's critique of the London stage, which, by the perpetuation of boy actors playing the part of the woman, serves to establish the superiority of the male spectator's sexuality.&lt;ref name=Sed /&gt; The male-male relationship, some critics have offered, between the male audience and the boy actor performing the female sexuality of the play would have been less threatening than had the part been played by a woman. It is in this manner that the London stage cultivated in its audience a chaste and obedient female subject, while positioning male sexuality as dominant. Shakespeare critics argue that the metatheatrical references in ''Antony and Cleopatra'' seem to critique this trend and the presentation of Cleopatra as a sexually empowered individual supports their argument that Shakespeare seems to be questioning the oppression of female sexuality in London society.&lt;ref name=Sed /&gt;{{rp|p.63}} The crossdresser, then, is not a visible object but rather a structure "enacting the failure of a dominant [[epistemology]] in which knowledge is equated with visibility".&lt;ref name=Sed /&gt;{{rp|p.64}} What is being argued here is that the [[cross-dressing]] on the London stage challenges the dominant epistemology of Elizabethan society that associated sight with knowledge. The boy actors portraying female sexuality on the London stage contradicted such a simple [[ontology]].

Critics such as Rackin interpret Shakespeare's metatheatrical references to the crossdressing on stage with less concern for societal elements and more of a focus on the dramatic ramifications. Rackin argues in her article on "Shakespeare's Boy Cleopatra" that Shakespeare manipulates the crossdressing to highlight a motif of the play—recklessness—which is discussed in the article as the recurring elements of acting without properly considering the consequences. Rackin cites the same quote, "Antony/ Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see/ Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness/ I'th' posture of a whore" to make the argument that here the audience is reminded of the very same treatment Cleopatra is receiving on Shakespeare's stage (since she is being portrayed by a boy actor) (V.ii.214–217). Shakespeare, utilizing the metatheatrical reference to his own stage, perpetuates his motif of recklessness by purposefully shattering "the audience's acceptance of the dramatic illusion".&lt;ref name=Rackin /&gt;{{rp|p.201}}

Other critics argue that the crossdressing as it occurs in the play is less of a mere convention, and more of an embodiment of dominant power structures. Critics such as Charles Forker argue that the boy actors were a result of what "we may call androgyny".&lt;ref name=Forker /&gt; His article argues that "women were barred from the stage for their own sexual protection" and because "patriarchally acculturated audiences presumably found it intolerable to see English women—those who would represent mothers, wives, and daughters—in sexually compromising situations".&lt;ref name=Forker /&gt;{{rp|p.10}}  Essentially, the crossdressing occurs as a result of the patriarchally structured society.

==== Empire ====

===== Sexuality and empire =====

The textual motif of empire within ''Antony and Cleopatra'' has strong gendered and erotic undercurrents. Antony, the Roman soldier characterised by a certain effeminacy, is the main article of conquest, falling first to Cleopatra and then to Caesar (Octavius). Cleopatra's triumph over her lover is attested to by Caesar himself, who gibes that Antony "is not more manlike/ Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy/ More womanly than he" (1.4.5–7). That Cleopatra takes on the role of male aggressor in her relationship with Antony should not be surprising; after all, "a culture attempting to dominate another culture will [often] endow itself with masculine qualities and the culture it seeks to dominate with feminine ones"&lt;ref name=Little /&gt;—appropriately, the queen's romantic assault is frequently imparted in a political, even militaristic fashion. Antony's subsequent loss of manhood seemingly "signifies his lost Romanness, and Act 3, Scene 10, is a virtual litany of his lost and feminised self, his "wounder chance".&lt;ref name=Little /&gt; Throughout the play, Antony is gradually bereaved of that Roman quality so coveted in his nostalgic interludes—by the centremost scenes, his sword (a plainly phallic image), he tells Cleopatra, has been "made weak by his affection" (3.11.67). In Act 4, Scene 14, "an un-Romaned Antony" laments, "O, thy vile lady!/ She has robb'd me of my sword," (22–23)—critic Arthur L. Little Jr. writes that here "he seems to echo closely the victim of [[raptus]], of bride theft, who has lost the sword she wishes to turn against herself. By the time Antony tries to use his sword to kill himself, it amounts to little more than a stage prop".&lt;ref name=Little /&gt; Antony is reduced to a political object, "the pawn in a power game between Caesar and Cleopatra".&lt;ref name=Moore /&gt;

Having failed to perform Roman masculinity and virtue, Antony's only means with which he might "write himself into Rome's imperial narrative and position himself at the birth of empire" is to cast himself in the feminine archetype of the sacrificial virgin; "once [he] understands his failed [[virtus (virtue)|virtus]], his failure to be Aeneas, he then tries to emulate [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]]".&lt;ref name=Little /&gt; ''Antony and Cleopatra'' can be read as a rewrite of Virgil's epic, with the sexual roles reversed and sometimes inverted. James J Greene writes on the subject: "If one of the seminally powerful myths in the cultural memory of our past is Aeneas' rejection of his African queen in order to go on and found the [[Roman Empire]], than it is surely significant that Shakespeare's {{sic}}... depicts precisely and quite deliberately the opposite course of action from that celebrated by Virgil. For Antony... turned his back for the sake of his African queen on that same Roman state established by Aeneas".&lt;ref name=Little /&gt; Antony even attempts to commit suicide for his love, falling short in the end. He is incapable of "occupying the... politically empowering place" of the female sacrificial victim.&lt;ref name=Little /&gt; The abundant imagery concerning his person—"of penetration, wounds, blood, marriage, orgasm, and shame"—informs the view of some critics that the Roman "figures Antony's body as queer, that is, as an open male body... [he] not only 'bends' in devotion' but... bends over".&lt;ref name=Little /&gt; In reciprocal contrast, "in both Caesar and Cleopatra we see very active wills and energetic pursuit of goals".&lt;ref name=r4/&gt; While Caesar's empirical objective can be considered strictly political, however, Cleopatra's is explicitly erotic; she conquers carnally—indeed, "she made great Caesar lay his sword to bed;/ He plough'd her, and she cropp'd" (2.2.232–233). Her mastery is unparalleled when it comes to the seduction of certain powerful individuals, but popular criticism supports the notion that "as far as Cleopatra is concerned, the main thrust of the play's action might be described as a machine especially devised to bend her to the Roman will... and no doubt Roman order is sovereign at the end of the play. But instead of driving her down to ignominy, the Roman power forces her upward to nobility".&lt;ref name=Moore /&gt; Caesar says of her final deed, "Bravest at the last,/ She levelled at our purposes, and, being royal,/ Took her own way" (5.2.325–327).

Arthur L. Little, in agitative fashion, suggests that the desire to overcome the queen has a corporeal connotation: "If a black—read foreign—man raping a white woman encapsulates an iconographic truth... of the dominant society's sexual, racial, national, and imperial fears, a white man raping a black woman becomes the evidentiary playing out of its self-assured and cool stranglehold over these representative foreign bodies".&lt;ref name=Little /&gt; Furthermore, he writes, "Rome shapes its Egyptian imperial struggle most visually around the contours of Cleopatra's sexualised and racialised black body—most explicitly her "tawny front", her "gipsy's lust", and her licentious climactic genealogy, "with Phoebus' amorous pinches black".&lt;ref name=Little /&gt; In a similar vein, essayist David Quint contends that "with Cleopatra the opposition between East and West is characterised in terms of gender: the otherness of the Easterner becomes the otherness of the opposite sex".&lt;ref name=Quint /&gt; Quint argues that Cleopatra (not Antony) fulfils Virgil's Dido archetype; "woman is subordinated as is generally the case in ''[[The Aeneid]]'', excluded from power and the process of Empire-building: this exclusion is evident in the poem's fiction where [[Creusa]] disappears and Dido is abandoned... woman's place or displacement is therefore in the East, and epic features a series of oriental heroines whose seductions are potentially more perilous than Eastern arms",&lt;ref name=Quint /&gt; i.e., Cleopatra.

===== Politics of empire =====

''Antony and Cleopatra'' deals ambiguously with the politics of imperialism and colonization. Critics have long been invested in untangling the web of political implications that characterise the play. Interpretations of the work often rely on an understanding of Egypt and Rome as they respectively signify Elizabethan ideals of East and West, contributing to a long-standing conversation about the play's representation of the relationship between imperializing western countries and colonised eastern cultures.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt; Despite Octavius Caesar's concluding victory and the absorption of Egypt into Rome, ''Antony and Cleopatra'' resists clear-cut alignment with Western values. Indeed, Cleopatra's suicide has been interpreted as suggesting an indomitable quality in Egypt, and reaffirming Eastern culture as a timeless contender to the West.&lt;ref name=Freeman /&gt; However, particularly in earlier criticism, the narrative trajectory of Rome's triumph and Cleopatra's perceived weakness as a ruler have allowed readings that privilege Shakespeare's representation of a Roman worldview. Octavius Caesar is seen as Shakespeare's portrayal of an ideal governor, though perhaps an unfavourable friend or lover, and Rome is emblematic of reason and political excellence.&lt;ref name=Politics /&gt; According to this reading, Egypt is viewed as destructive and vulgar; the critic Paul Lawrence Rose writes: "Shakespeare clearly envisages Egypt as a political hell for the subject, where natural rights count for nothing."&lt;ref name=Politics /&gt; Through the lens of such a reading, the ascendancy of Rome over Egypt does not speak to the practice of empire-building as much as it suggests the inevitable advantage of reason over sensuality.

More contemporary scholarship on the play, however, has typically recognised the allure of Egypt for ''Antony and Cleopatra''{{'}}s audiences. Egypt's magnetism and seeming cultural primacy over Rome have been explained by efforts to contextualise the political implications of the play within its period of production. The various protagonists' ruling styles have been identified with rulers contemporary to Shakespeare. For example, there appears to be continuity between the character of Cleopatra and the historical figure of [[Queen Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]],&lt;ref name=r13/&gt; and the unfavourable light cast on Caesar has been explained as deriving from the claims of various 16th-century historians.&lt;ref name=r11/&gt;

The more recent influence of [[New Historicism]] and [[Post-colonial theory|post-colonial]] studies have yielded readings of Shakespeare that typify the play as subversive, or challenging the status quo of Western imperialism. The critic Abigail Scherer's claim that "Shakespeare's Egypt is a holiday world"&lt;ref name=r14/&gt; recalls the criticisms of Egypt put forth by earlier scholarship and disputes them. Scherer and critics who recognise the wide appeal of Egypt have connected the spectacle and glory of Cleopatra's greatness with the spectacle and glory of the theatre itself. Plays, as breeding grounds of idleness, were subject to attack by all levels of authority in the 1600s;&lt;ref&gt;Greenblatt, Stephen. "General Introduction: The Enemies of the Stage." ''The Norton Shakespeare, Vol. 2: Later Plays''. New York and London: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the play's celebration of pleasure and idleness in a subjugated Egypt makes it plausible to draw parallels between Egypt and the heavily censored theatre culture in England. In the context of England's political atmosphere, Shakespeare's representation of Egypt, as the greater source of poetry and imagination, resists support for 16th century colonial practices.&lt;ref name=Crane /&gt; Importantly, [[King James I of England|King James]]' sanction of the founding of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] occurred within months of ''Antony and Cleopatra''{{'}}s debut on stage. England during the Renaissance found itself in an analogous position to the early Roman Republic. Shakespeare's audience may have made the connection between England's westward expansion and ''Antony and Cleopatra''{{'}}s convoluted picture of Roman imperialism. In support of the reading of Shakespeare's play as subversive, it has also been argued that 16th century audiences would have interpreted ''Antony and Cleopatra''{{'}}s depiction of different models of government as exposing inherent weaknesses in an absolutist, imperial, and by extension monarchical, political state.&lt;ref name=r12/&gt;

===== Empire and intertextuality =====

One of the ways to read the imperialist themes of the play is through a historical, political context with an eye for intertextuality. Many scholars suggest that Shakespeare possessed an extensive knowledge of the story of Antony and Cleopatra through the historian Plutarch, and used Plutarch's account as a blueprint for his own play. A closer look at this intertextual link reveals that Shakespeare used, for instance, Plutarch's assertion that Antony claimed a genealogy that led back to Hercules, and constructed a parallel to Cleopatra by often associating her with [[Dionysus]] in his play.&lt;ref name=r9/&gt; The implication of this historical mutability is that Shakespeare is transposing non-Romans upon his Roman characters, and thus his play assumes a political agenda rather than merely committing itself to a historical recreation. Shakespeare deviates from a strictly obedient observation of Plutarch, though, by complicating a simple dominant/dominated dichotomy with formal choices. For instance, the quick exchange of dialogue might suggest a more dynamic political conflict. Furthermore, certain characteristics of the characters, like Antony whose "legs bestrid the ocean" (5.2.82) point to constant change and mutability.&lt;ref name=Wolf /&gt; Plutarch, on the other hand, was given to "tendencies to stereotype, to polarise, and to exaggerate that are inherent in the propaganda surrounding his subjects."&lt;ref name=Miles /&gt;

Furthermore, because of the unlikelihood that Shakespeare would have had direct access to the Greek text of Plutarch's ''[[Parallel Lives]]'' and probably read it through a French translation from a Latin translation, his play constructs Romans with an anachronistic Christian sensibility that might have been influenced by [[St. Augustine]]'s ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'' among others. As Miles writes, the ancient world would not have been aware of interiority and the contingence of salvation upon conscience until Augustine.&lt;ref name=Miles /&gt; For the Christian world, salvation relied on and belonged to the individual, while the Roman world viewed salvation as political. So, Shakespeare's characters in ''Antony and Cleopatra'', particularly Cleopatra in her belief that her own suicide is an exercise of agency, exhibit a Christian understanding of [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]].

Another example of deviance from the source material is how Shakespeare characterises the rule of Antony and Cleopatra. While Plutarch singles out the "order of exclusive society" that the lovers surrounded themselves with – a society with a specifically defined and clear understanding of the hierarchies of power as determined by birth and status – Shakespeare's play seems more preoccupied with the power dynamics of pleasure as a main theme throughout the play.&lt;ref name=r8/&gt; Once pleasure has become a dynamic of power, then it permeates society and politics. Pleasure serves as a differentiating factor between Cleopatra and Antony, between Egypt and Rome, and can be read as the fatal flaw of the heroes if ''Antony and Cleopatra'' is a tragedy. For Shakespeare's ''Antony and Cleopatra'', the exclusivity and superiority supplied by pleasure created the disconnect between the ruler and the subjects. Critics suggest that Shakespeare did similar work with these sources in ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', and ''[[Coriolanus]]''.

==== The happy ending of ''Antony and Cleopatra'' ====
[[File:Cleopatra holds the dead Antony.jpg|thumb|A late 19th-century painting of Act IV, Scene 15: Cleopatra holds Antony as he dies.]]
''Antony and Cleopatra'' was never intended to be a tragedy; instead, Shakespeare gave the illusion of the tragedy as the two protagonists set out to become the heroes of the play and neither succeeded. Antony and Cleopatra are seen to have a passionate love for each other up till their demise as both are seen ending their lives for the other. Although the couple was seen as a pair that could not live without the other, it does not take much to be able to point out that the basis of their relationship lies on manipulation and lust. Enobarbus was able to see this as he never believed their love was true but instead a contradiction. Cleopatra always wanted Antony to be in the palm of her hands, to always be in control of his emotions and would thus manipulate him by dancing whenever he was sad or fake a sickness if he were to be happy. This makes Antony only chase after Cleopatra even more in a never-ending cycle. They both try to be much more than they are and show their enemies and the world that they are invincible. Rather than them sacrificing themselves for the other, the two protagonists set out to become the hero of the play and to show that being the last one standing, no hand will bring them down but their own. They did not die for love but for the fame that would come behind that sacrifice and in the end are seen as being noble and self-sacrificing. It does not end in a tragedy but in a bittersweet and almost happy ending.

Both of the lovers' fates are interwoven yet they deceive the other in a fight for dominance that Cleopatra wins for a while as the audience and other characters throughout the play know completely what is going on in the play filled with dramatic irony. Enobarbus once again knows of Antony's unrelenting attachment to Cleopatra and Cleopatra's mind games while the audience knows Cleopatra isn't dead as Antony kills himself over her. They both spent their whole lives trying to achieve higher fame than the other and became notorious for their lust. They are their own Gods and live separate from those that they call normal and watch. The play progresses into the protagonists decline in fame, leaving them to pursue a sure way into that immortality they coveted. They become immortals in death along with even more fame and has as well achieved their goal from the beginning. They die in the name of their love when they really die in the name of fame. A status of nobility higher than us and pity for the tragedy that is their relationship. The tragedy is Antony and Cleopatra's own happy ending as death was a small price to pay to become real gods. They proved that the only death that could touch them were by their own hand, further increasing that godly power they received from the people. Now they are apart from those they watched, now they are above them, and now they will be worshipped as gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oates|first= Joyce Carol|title=The Tragedy of Imagination: Shakespeare's ''Antony and Cleopatra''|publisher= University of San Francisco (USF).

====Fortune and chance: politics and nature====
The concept of luck, or Fortune, is frequently referenced throughout ''Antony and Cleopatra'', portrayed as an elaborate "game" that the characters participate in. An element of Fate lies within the play's concept of Chance, as the subject of Fortune/Chance's favour at any particular moment becomes the most successful character. Shakespeare represents Fortune through elemental and astronomical imagery that recalls the characters' awareness of the "unreliability of the natural world".&lt;ref name="Hallet"&gt;Hallet&lt;/ref&gt; This calls into question the extent to which the characters' actions influence the resulting consequences, and whether the characters are subject to the preferences of Fortune or Chance. Antony eventually realises that he, like other characters, is merely "Fortune's knave," a mere card in the game of Chance rather than a player.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"&gt;Lloyd&lt;/ref&gt; This realization suggests that Antony realises that he is powerless in relation to the forces of Chance, or Fortune. The manner in which the characters deal with their luck is of great importance, therefore, as they may destroy their chances of luck by taking advantage of their fortune to excessive lengths without censoring their actions, Antony did.&lt;ref name="Williamson"&gt;Williamson&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Marilyn Williamson notes that the characters may spoil their Fortune by, "riding too high" on it, as Antony did by ignoring his duties in Rome and spending time in Egypt with Cleopatra. While Fortune does play a large role in the characters' lives, they do have ability to exercise free will, however; as Fortune is not as restrictive as Fate. Antony's actions suggest this, as he is able to use his free will to take advantage of his luck by choosing his own actions. 
Like the natural imagery used to describe Fortune, scholar Michael Lloyd characterises it as an element itself, which causes natural occasional upheaval. This implies that fortune is a force of nature that is greater than mankind, and cannot be manipulated. The 'game of chance' that Fortune puts into play can be related to that of politics, expressing the fact that the characters must play their luck in both fortune and politics to identify a victor.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt; The play culminates, however, in Antony's realization that he is merely a card, not a player in this game.

The motif of "card playing" has a political undertone, as it relates to the nature of political dealings.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;Thomas&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar and Antony take action against each other as if playing a card game; playing by the rules of Chance,&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt; which sways in its preference from time to time. Although Caesar and Antony may play political cards with each other, their successes rely somewhat on Chance, which hints at a certain limit to the control they have over political affairs. Furthermore, the constant references to astronomical bodies and "sublunar" imagery&lt;ref name="Williamson"/&gt; connote a Fate-like quality to the character of Fortune, implying a lack of control on behalf of the characters. Although the characters do exercise free will to a certain extent, their success in regard to their actions ultimately depends on the luck that Fortune bestows upon them. The movement of the "moon" and the "tides" is frequently mentioned throughout the play, such as when Cleopatra states that, upon Antony's death, there is nothing of importance left "beneath the moon." The elemental and astronomical "sublunar"&lt;ref name="Hallet"/&gt; imagery frequently referred to throughout the play is thus intertwined with the political manipulation that each character incites, yet the resulting winner of the political "game" relies in part on Chance, which has a supreme quality that the characters cannot maintain control over, and therefore must submit to.

[[File:Recep Tayyip Erdoğan June 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (2015)]]
The '''Böhmermann affair''' (also known as '''Erdogate'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://diepresse.com/home/kultur/medien/4968876/Nach-Erdogate_Bohmermann-macht-mal-Pause|title=Nach "Erdogate": Böhmermann macht mal Pause|newspaper=DiePresse.com|access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a political affair following an experimental poem on [[Germans|German]] [[satirist]] [[Jan Böhmermann]]'s satire show ''[[Neo Magazin Royale]]'' in late March 2016 that deliberately insulted Turkish president [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] using profane language.

Days after a music video titled ''[[Erdowie, Erdowo, Erdoğan]]'' in another German satire show had infuriated Erdoğan, prompting Ankara to summon the German ambassador, Böhmermann went on to find the line between satire, which is protected by [[freedom of speech]] legislation, and "abusive criticism" ({{lang-de|Schmähkritik}}) of a foreign state leader ([[Lèse-majesté]]), which still was a punishable offense in Germany at that time. Explicitly acknowledging this experiment to be deliberately offensive and "forbidden", Böhmermann went on to present a poem that not only harshly criticized Erdoğan for his [[Human rights in Turkey|human rights]] record, but was also liberally seasoned with profanity.

After the show was aired on German public television channel [[ZDFneo]], the Turkish government released a [[verbal note]] demanding that the German government begin criminal prosecution of Böhmermann. German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] further escalated the situation by apologizing for Böhmermann's "intentionally hurtful" poem – later she called this "a mistake".&lt;ref name="ds3"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/jan-boehmermann-angela-merkel-raeumt-fehler-ein-a-1088861.html Gedicht über Erdogan: Merkel räumt Fehler in Böhmermann-Affäre ein], [[Der Spiegel]], in German&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 April Merkel announced in a press conference that the German government had approved Böhmermann's criminal prosecution, but would abolish the respective paragraph 103 of the German penal code before 2018. Intense criticism followed the Chancellor's decision, with speculation that she decided to allow the prosecution in order to protect Germany's refugee deal with Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/16/opinion/erdogan-and-merkels-comic-comeuppance.html|title=Erdogan and Merkel’s Comic Comeuppance|first=Anna|last=Sauerbrey|date=15 April 2016|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was dropped in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=German comedian escapes prosecution|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37554167|accessdate=4 October 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{see also|Erdowie, Erdowo, Erdoğan}}
Earlier in March, the satirical music video ''[[Erdowie, Erdowo, Erdoğan]]'' by German satire show ''[[extra 3]]'' had infuriated Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|Erdoğan]], prompting Ankara to summon the German ambassador.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news |author=Alison Smale |title=Comedian’s Takedown of Turkish President Tests Free Speech in Germany |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/12/world/europe/jan-bohmermann-erdogan-neo-magazin-royale.html |date=11 April 2016 |accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Schmähkritik''==
In his show, Böhmermann announced he would try to illustrate what is the line between legitimate criticism such as the ''extra 3'' video, which is protected by [[freedom of speech]] legislation, and "abusive criticism" ({{lang-de|Schmähkritik}}) of a foreign state leader, which at that time in Germany was a punishable offense.&lt;ref name=WPost&gt;{{cite news |title=Will Ms. Merkel defend free expression? |author=Washington Post Editorial board |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/will-ms-merkel-defend-free-expression/2016/04/13/7f4ab7d8-0199-11e6-b823-707c79ce3504_story.html |date=April 13, 2016 |accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Openly acknowledging that his experiment would be deliberately offensive, and standing in front of a Turkish flag and a portrait of Erdoğan, Böhmermann presented an experimental poem that not only harshly criticized Erdoğan for his [[Human rights in Turkey|human rights]] record, but also contained profanity.&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt;

Böhmermann, among other things, called Erdoğan "the man who beats girls", and said that he loved to "fuck goats and suppress minorities, kick Kurds, hit Christians, and watch child pornography."&lt;ref name="Schmähkritik FAZ"&gt;{{cite web | last=GmbH | first=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung | title=Erdogan-Satire: Staatsanwaltschaft ermittelt gegen Böhmermann | website=FAZ.NET | date=2016-04-06 |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/medien/ermittlungen-gegen-jan-boehmermann-wegen-erdogan-gedicht-14163940.html | language=de | accessdate=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiegel Schmähkritik"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nach Erdogan-Schmähkritik: Staatsanwalt ermittelt gegen Jan Böhmermann | website={{Interlanguage link multi|HORIZONT|2=de|3=Horizont (Zeitschrift)|preserve=1}} | url=http://www.horizont.net/medien/nachrichten/Nach-Erdogan-Schmaehkritik-Staatsanwalt-ermittelt-gegen-Jan-Boehmermann-139640 | language=de | accessdate=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RT Deutsch: Schmähkritik"&gt;{{cite web | title=Wegen "Schmähkritik" an Erdogan – Satiriker Böhmermann droht mehrjährige Haftstrafe | website=RT Deutsch | url=https://deutsch.rt.com/gesellschaft/37657-wegen-schmahkritik-an-erdogan-/ | language=de | accessdate=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the rest of the poem is devoted to associating Erdoğan with various less accepted forms of sexuality. Böhmermann deliberately played with the limits of satire and said several times that this form of abusive criticism was not allowed in Germany.&lt;ref name="waz"&gt;[https://www.derwesten.de/kultur/fernsehen/erdogan-gedicht-staatsanwalt-ermittelt-gegen-jan-boehmermann-id11709593.html Erdogan-Gedicht: Staatsanwalt ermittelt gegen Jan Böhmermann], [[Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung]], in German&lt;/ref&gt;

This edition of Böhmermann's show ''[[Neo Magazin Royale]]'' was aired on 31 March 2016 on public television channel [[ZDF neo]].

==Reactions to the show==

===Public broadcaster ZDF ===
The ZDF channel distanced itself from the poem and deleted it from the program which can be seen in its internet archives "Mediathek".&lt;ref name="welt"&gt;[https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article154185645/Tuerkei-fordert-Strafverfahren-gegen-Boehmermann.html Türkei fordert Strafverfahren gegen Böhmermann], [[Die Welt]], in German&lt;/ref&gt; Few days later, ZDF director [[Thomas Bellut]] announced the support for ''Neo Magazin Royale'' and the presenter. On 16 April, the channel assured the "full legal protection" for Böhmermann throughout the judicial procedures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.n-tv.de/politik/ZDF-sichert-Boehmermann-rechtlich-ab-article17482506.html ZDF sichert Böhmermann rechtlich ab], [[n-tv]], in German&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkish government===
The Turkish government released a verbal note in which it demands the criminal prosecution of Böhmermann.&lt;ref name="welt"/&gt; According to the law, the government has to approve the demand for criminal prosecution by the foreign government, before criminal proceedings can be started because of §103/104 [[StGB]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heute.de/boehmermann-und-schmaehkritik-gegen-erdogan-bundesregierung-prueft-anliegen-der-tuerkei-43048968.html Fall Böhmermann: Regierung prüft Türkei-Forderung], [[heute]], in German&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/boehmermann-rechtliche-grundlagen-moeglicher-ermittlungen-a-1086555.html Schmähgedicht über Erdogan: Der Moderator und der Schah-Paragraf], [[Der Spiegel]], in German&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Erdogan himself made a complaint against Böhmermann as a private person because of the alleged insulting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/erdogan-stellt-strafantrag-gegen-jan-boehmermann-a-1086637.html Wegen Beleidigung: Erdogan stellt Strafantrag gegen Böhmermann], [[Der Spiegel]], in German&lt;/ref&gt; The Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey, [[Numan Kurtulmuş]], called the poem a "serious crime against humanity".&lt;ref name="welt2"/&gt;

=== Legal complaints ===
20 people lodged a complaint because of his poem named "{{Interlanguage link multi|Schmähkritik|de|3=Schmähkritik (Gedicht)}}" (abusive criticism). The instituted proceedings by the prosecutor's office for "insulting of organs and representatives of foreign states" are based on principle §103&lt;ref name="GCC §103"&gt;{{cite web | title=GERMAN CRIMINAL CODE | website=Startseite | date=1998-11-13 | url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1035 | accessdate=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and §104&lt;ref name="GCC §104"&gt;{{cite web | title=GERMAN CRIMINAL CODE | website=Startseite | date=1998-11-13 | url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1038 | accessdate=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the German penal code.

==Reactions to the Turkish government's complaint==

===German government===
After a phone call with the Turkish Prime Minister, [[Ahmet Davutoglu]], Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] criticised the poem as "intentionally hurtful" ("bewusst verletzend"),&lt;ref name="waz"/&gt; and prosecutors in [[Mainz]] planned to consult the federal Justice Ministry on whether to launch criminal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dw.com/en/german-prosecutors-open-case-against-comedian-jan-böhmermann/a-19170468 | title= German prosecutors open case against comedian Jan Böhmermann | publisher= [[Deutsche Welle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 April, Merkel announced in a press conference that the German government approves a criminal prosecution of Böhmermann, though confirming reports of disagreement between a number of her [[coalition government]]'s ministries and her office. Merkel said, it was "not the business of the government" to make a decision in this case, but of the justice. Considering the particular paragraph of the German criminal code "unnecessary," she however announced legal steps would be taken towards scrapping it by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Philip Oltermann |title=Angela Merkel agrees to prosecution of comedian over Erdoğan poem |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/15/angela-merkel-agrees-prosecution-comedian-erdogan-poem |date=15 April 2016 |accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Oppermann]], leader of coalition partner [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]'s [[Bundestag]] faction, criticised the decision: "I think this decision is wrong", he said.&lt;ref name="ds2"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/jan-boehmermann-bundesregierung-laesst-strafverfahren-zu-a-1087400.html Schmähgedicht auf Erdogan: Bundesregierung lässt Strafverfahren gegen Böhmermann zu], [[Der Spiegel]], in German&lt;/ref&gt; In the past days, there had been dissent in this question between the SPD-led [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Office]] and the [[Bundeskanzleramt]].&lt;ref name="ds2"/&gt; It was also reported that Merkel herself had changed her mind several times.&lt;ref name="diewelt"/&gt;

All SPD ministers voted against the decision in the federal government. Nevertheless, Merkel's vote for the prosecution of Böhmermann was decisive. The opposition parties in the Bundestag, [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] and [[The Left (Germany)|Die Linke]], as well as the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] party sharply criticised the decision.&lt;ref name="diewelt"&gt;[https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article154412485/Merkel-laesst-Boehmermann-fuer-ihren-Fehler-buessen.html Merkel lässt Böhmermann für ihren Fehler büßen], [[Die Welt]], in German&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 April Merkel herself called her criticism of the poem as "intentionally hurtful" a "mistake" about which she was "annoyed", while defending the decision to allow criminal proceedings against Böhmermann.&lt;ref name="ds3"/&gt;

===Parliament===
During a [[Bundestag]] debate on 12 May 2016, the CDU MP [[Detlef Seif]] read the whole poem to demonstrate that it is an insult of the Turkish president, causing the outrage of several other MPs. "Put yourself in Erdogan's position and think about how you would feel", Seif added in support of Angela Merkel. Böhmermann reacted with a [[Twitter]] post demanding the lifting of immunity of Seif.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focus.de/politik/videos/redebeitrag-sorgt-fuer-empoerung-eklat-im-bundestag-cdu-politiker-verliest-das-schmaehgedicht-von-boehmermann_id_5526409.html CDU-Politiker Seif verliest das Schmähgedicht von Böhmermann], [[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]], in German&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
On 10 April the CEO of publishing house [[Axel Springer SE]], [[Mathias Döpfner]], made a plea for "solidarity with Jan Böhmermann". He compared Böhmermann's poem to the works of [[Martin Kippenberger]]. Also he referred to [[Michel Houellebecq]]'s ''[[Submission (novel)|Submission]]'' and accused the German government of [[kowtowing]] to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/debatte/kommentare/article154171281/Solidaritaet-mit-Jan-Boehmermann.html Solidarität mit Jan Böhmermann!], [[Die Welt]], in German&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 May it was reported by [[Deutsche Presseagentur]], that Erdoğan had sued also Döpfner. He applied for a preliminary injunction. It was reported that the court did not approve it, but Erdoğans lawyer {{Interlanguage link multi|Ralf Höcker|de}} wanted to turn to the next instance.&lt;ref name="dw"&gt;[https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article155197942/Erdogan-beantragt-einstweilige-Verfuegung-gegen-Mathias-Doepfner.html Erdogan beantragt einstweilige Verfügung gegen Mathias Döpfner], [[Die Welt]], in German&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Erdoğan had applied for a preliminary injunction against film director [[Uwe Boll]], which was granted. Now Boll isn't allowed to call Erdoğan a "moronic little wimp" anymore.&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt; Höcker compared the criticism of Erdoğan with a "mass rape".&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt;

The ''[[Washington Post]]'' editorial board harshly criticized the German government's reaction in a featured commentary titled ''"Will Ms. Merkel defend free expression?"'' The editors hold both the ''"anachronistic law"'' and the ''"morally dubious"'' refugee deal with Turkey, accountable for what they consider Merkel's countenancing Turkish president ''"Erdoğan's bullying inside Germany"''. They fear Merkel's ''"waffling"'' would encourage regimes around the world trying to suppress free speech both outside their borders and within.&lt;ref name=WPost /&gt;

[[Douglas Murray (author)|Douglas Murray]] of ''[[The Spectator]]'' ran a competition for offensive poems about Erdoğan, promising £1,000 as first prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Insult Turkey's Erdogan' contest set up by Spectator magazine|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36086563|accessdate=19 April 2016|date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner was [[Boris Johnson]], Conservative MP and former [[Mayor of London]], who is one-eighth Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elgot|first1=Jessica|title=Boris Johnson wins 'most offensive Erdoğan poem' competition|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/19/boris-johnson-wins-most-offensive-erdogan-poem-competition|accessdate=20 May 2016|work=The Guardian|date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public===
Former [[Greece|Greek]] [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|finance minister]] [[Yanis Varoufakis]] wrote on [[Twitter]]: "Europe first lost its soul (agreement with Turkey on refugees), now it is losing its humour. Hands off @janboehm!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/yanisvaroufakis/status/719438182878691328|title=Yanis Varoufakis on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a satirical letter to president Erdoğan, the mayor of [[Tübingen]], [[Boris Palmer]] ([[Alliance '90/The Greens]]), assured the president of his "solidarity" and demanded the extradition of Böhmermann to Turkey. "Cut off Böhmermann's testicles, so he never makes fun of presidents with a short dick again", he wrote. The letter is signed "most respectfully, Boris Palmer".&lt;ref name="welt2"&gt;[https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article154260216/Palmer-macht-sich-fuer-Auslieferung-Boehmermanns-stark.html Palmer macht sich für Auslieferung Böhmermanns stark], [[Die Welt]], in German&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[YouGov]] poll revealed on 12 April, that a majority of the Germans supported Böhmermann's position. 48 percent of the pollees found the poem appropriate, 29 percent view it as undue. A great majority (66 percent) opposed the deletion of the poem on the ZDF website as well as Merkel's criticism of the poem as "intentionally hurtful" (68 percent). Only 15 percent support a criminal investigation, 77 percent objected it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://yougov.de/news/2016/04/12/erdogan-gedicht-knappe-mehrheit-auf-bohmermanns-se/ Erdogan-Gedicht: Mehrheit auf Böhmermanns Seite], [[YouGov]].de, in German&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, more than 240,000 people signed a petition for Böhmermann at [[Change.org]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/boehmermann-vs-erdogan-schimpf-oder-schande/13432076.html Schimpf oder Schande], [[Der Tagesspiegel]], in German&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeboehmi – Change.org&lt;/ref&gt; A further poll by [[Infratest dimap]] for the German [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] broadcaster published on 17 April showed that 65 percent of the Germans considered Merkel's decision to allow criminal proceedings against Böhmermann as "wrong", 28 percent supported it. Also Merkel's personal popularity fell, 45 percent were satisfied with her work, while 56 percent were dissatisfied, an all-time low for her in this legislative period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article154449455/Merkel-verliert-wegen-Boehmermann-deutlich-an-Zuspruch.html Merkel verliert wegen Böhmermann deutlich an Zuspruch], [[Die Welt]], in German&lt;/ref&gt;

In an open letter several artists and actors expressed solidarity with Böhmermann on 13 April. Among them were the actors [[Matthias Brandt]], [[Katja Riemann]], [[Jan Josef Liefers]], [[Peter Lohmeyer]], the TV presenter [[Klaas Heufer-Umlauf]], writer [[Thea Dorn]] and pianist [[Igor Levit]]. "Discussions about and criticism of Jan Böhmermann's Erdoğan poem belong in the newspaper arts sections of the country and not in a courtroom in Mainz", they wrote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bild.de/politik/inland/jan-boehmermann/soli-brief-boehmermann-45353666.bild.html "Liebe Regierung, jetzt mal ruhig bleiben!"], [[Bild]], in German&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 April 2016, [[Bruno Kramm]], leader of Berlin's branch of the [[Pirate Party Germany|German Pirate Party]], was arrested by the German police for reading the poem written by Jan Boehmermann in front of the Turkish embassy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://boingboing.net/2016/04/23/german-political-leader-arrest.html | title=German politician arrested in Berlin for insulting Turkish president | publisher=boingboing.net | accessdate=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International legislative reactions==
A 20 April 2016 ''[[Dagbladet]]'' editorial said that "People in Norway have been appalled that the German chancellor Angela Merkel has brought to life a dormant law to help Turkey's president (...) Therefore we support the initiative from [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|SV]]-politicians [[Audun Lysbakken]], [[Bård Vegar Solhjell]] and [[Heikki Holmås]] to remove a similar dormant law from the Norwegian [[penal code]]. Next week in parliament the SV-trio will  propose a change in the penal code's paragraph 184a".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/a/60154330|title=Satiren må beskyttes|date=19 April 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Netherlands]] announced to abolish the punishment for "insulting of foreign heads of state" as a reaction to the affair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diepresse.com/home/politik/aussenpolitik/4973523/Niederlande_Verbot-der-Beleidigung-von-Staatschefs-faellt Niederlande: Verbot der Beleidigung von Staatschefs fällt], Diepresse.com, in German&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satire of the satire==
In 2016 [[NRK]]'s website uploaded a video by NRK Satiriks; the video was linked from the website's home page, by the title of the video, "Erdogan admits to following a goat home: – But nothing happened".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/satiriks/erdogan-innrommer-at-han-ble-med-hjem-til-geit_---men-ingenting-skjedde-1.12913501|title=Erdogan innrømmer at han ble med hjem til geit: - Men ingenting skjedde|first=|last=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police protection==
On 12 April it was reported that Böhmermann is under police protection, because he was threatened by supporters of Erdoğan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focus.de/kultur/kino_tv/akut-durch-anhaenger-erdogans-gefaehrdet-jan-boehmermann-steht-unter-polizeischutz_id_5431142.html Jan Böhmermann steht unter Polizeischutz], [[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]], in German&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ds"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/tv/jan-boehmermann-sagt-naechste-neo-magazin-royale-sendung-a-1086800.html  Wirbel um Erdogan-Gedicht: Jan Böhmermann sagt nächste Sendung ab], [[Der Spiegel]], in German&lt;/ref&gt; The filming of upcoming editions of ''Neo Magazin Royale'' has been suspended until May 2016 due to "massive media reporting and the focus on the programme and the presenter".&lt;ref name="ds"/&gt; Böhmermann had also temporarily suspended his radio show ''Sanft &amp; Sorgfältig'' on Sundays and was not present at the [[Grimme-Preis]] (Grimme Awards), where he was awarded for his Varoufakis video.&lt;ref name="ds"/&gt;

==Böhmermann's reaction==
On 8 April Böhmermann asked [[Peter Altmaier]], Federal Minister of the [[German Chancellery]], for succor. "I would like to live in a country where the exploration of the limits of satire is allowed, desired and the subject of a civil society debate", he wrote on [[Twitter]]. He wouldn't ask for help, but desired to plead for "considering my artistic approach and my position, even if it is contentious", Böhmermann added. Altmaier wrote back, that he wanted to answer, when he was back in [[Berlin]], but didn't respond anymore since then.&lt;ref name="ds4"/&gt; Furthermore, Böhmermann engaged the well known media lawyer [[Christian Schertz]], who criticized Merkel and the German federal government among others for not respecting the [[separation of powers]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="ds4"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/jan-boehmermann-bat-kanzleramtschef-peter-altmaier-um-beistand-a-1086128.html Nach Erdogan-Kritik: Böhmermann bat Kanzleramtschef Altmaier um Beistand], [[Der Spiegel]], in German&lt;/ref&gt; Böhmermann himself on 16 April announced a 4-week pause of his TV and radio activities, which was confirmed by his channel ZDF. The next edition of ''Neo Magazin Royale'' is to be filmed on 12 May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/tv/jan-boehmermann-zdf-moderator-verkuendet-tv-pause-via-facebook-a-1087591.html Satirestreit mit Erdogan: Böhmermann verkündet Fernsehpause via Facebook], [[Der Spiegel]], in German&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Die Zeit]]'' on 3 May, Böhmermann sharply criticized Angela Merkel. "The chancellor must not waver when it comes to freedom and human rights", he said. "But instead she filleted me, served me to a neurotic despot for tea and made me become a German [[Ai Weiwei]]." His "belief" was shaken, "that every person in Germany has a non-negotiable, inalienable right to exercise certain basic rights: the freedom of art and the freedom of expression." Merkel did "obviously not think for a moment" about the poem, which he said was only an illustration of an insult: "It was much too dumb for me to insult Erdogan. I think, anyone can see this from the stupid smear poem." Böhmermann claimed that he had not even written it himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/kultur/2016-05/jan-boehmermann-interview "Präsident Erdoğan zu beleidigen, ist mir zu doof"], [[Die Zeit]], in German&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/kultur/film/2016-05/jan-boehmermann-interview-hermeneutik Proseminar Schmähkritik – nicht bestanden], [[Die Zeit]], in German&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/erdogan-gedicht-boehmermann-kritisiert-merkel-1.2979332 Böhmermann kritisiert Merkel], [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]], in German&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Syria]] is [[Administrative subdivision|subdivided]] in a [[hierarchical]] manner into:
*14 [[Governorates of Syria|Governorates]] (or G.)
**65 [[Districts of Syria|Districts]]
For each governorate, the first city in the table is the governorate capital (and capital city of its district at the same time). The following towns are the regional capitals (administrative centers) of the districts. The last item is the [[rural area]] outside the listed towns in each governorate.  Each section details a brief summary of that city or town's history during the [[Syrian Civil War]]. The population figures are given according to the 2004 official census. The table is [[Sorting|sortable]]. Click on the arrows next to the column headings to sort alphabetically, based on population, District, or control status.

== International governing organizations ==

=== World Dance Council ===
{{Main|World Dance Council}}

The World Dance Council (WDC) is a registered limited company, and the legal successor to the [[International Council of Ballroom Dancing]] (ICBD), which was formed in 1950 in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Lyndon Wainwright|Wainwright, Lyndon]] [1997]. ''The story of British popular dance''. International Dance Publications, Brighton.&lt;/ref&gt; The WDC operates through a general council and two committees:
* The World Dance Sport Committee regulates professional dancesport at the international level. 
* The World Social Dance Committee "deals with all matters of the dance profession that relate to the activities of Dance Schools and Dance Teachers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dancewdc.org/index.php?set_ActivMenu=95 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725220028/http://www.dancewdc.org/index.php?set_ActivMenu=95 |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not regulate social dance directly &amp;ndash; that is the business of individual organisers, the dance teacher organisations, such as the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]], and the chains of dance teaching schools in the United States.

In 2007 the WDC Amateur League was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=To All Competitors, Coaches/Trainers |publisher=World Dance Council - Amateur League |url=http://www.wdcamateurleague.com/news_detail.php?news_id=68 |accessdate=2010-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219033602/http://www.wdcamateurleague.com/news_detail.php?news_id=68 |archivedate=2010-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This organisation runs a number of competitions and has its own world ranking system for amateur dancers.

Each member country in the WDC has its own national organisation, such as the [[British Dance Council]], which acts as a forum for the many interested parties in that country. The national bodies decide on their delegates to the WDC.

=== World DanceSport Federation ===
{{Main|World DanceSport Federation}}

The '''World DanceSport Federation''' (WDSF), formerly the International DanceSport Federation (IDSF), is the international [[Sport governing body|governing body]] of dancesport, as recognised by the ''[[International Olympic Committee]]'' (IOC).

Founded in 1957 as the ''International Council of Amateur Dancers'' (ICAD), it took up the name IDSF in 1990. In 2011 it was renamed to WDSF to emphasise the global character of the organization.

In the past, the focus of the IDSF was on administering amateur dancers and competitions. However, in 2010 the IDSF Professional Division was created (formerly known as the IPDSC), which extended this focus to professional dancesport.&lt;ref name="wdsf-history"/&gt;

WDSF members are not permitted to dance in competitions unless they are granted by the WDSF, or one of its member federations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ''Code of Conduct and Standards of Ethics'' | url = http://www.worlddancesport.org/Rule/Athlete/Operating%20Policies | accessdate = 2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*This policy was revoked in 2012 at the Annual General Meeting by vote of the members.  The WDSF now supports an athlete's "right to dance".

== Competitions ==
[[File:Ballroom dance competition cha cha 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Junior [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha-cha]] competition in [[Czech Republic]]]]

There are a wide variety of dance competitions. They range from the well known [[Blackpool Dance Festival]], an event open to all, to competitions conducted exclusively for university students, such as those hosted by the [[Inter Varsity Dance Association]] in the UK.

Amateur competitions commonly include events that group dancers by age, experience, or both. For example, events might group young dancers by age, such as: juvenile (&lt;12yrs), junior (12-16yrs), and youth (16-19yrs). Events may sometimes cover a wide range of ages, with groupings such as: under 21yrs, adult, senior I (Over 35yrs), senior II (Over 45yrs), senior III (Over 55yrs, and senior IV (Over 65yrs).

Competitors may also be grouped by experience level, with categories such as Beginner, Novice, Intermediate, Pre-Amateur and Amateur. These generally correspond to the number of the dances to be performed in the competition, with Beginners performing one dance, and those at Amateur level performing five. In some competitions these are categorized into grades from A to E, with "A" the equivalent of the Amateur level, and "E" corresponding to the "Beginner" level.

=== WDSF minimum competition dance area size standard ===
WDSF governing bodies in different countries have the flexibility to decide on the dance area size for competitions held in the country.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Location !! Official Standard !! Compare Square Meter !! Compare Square Feet
|-
| Europe || 26m x 16m || 416 || 4478
|-
| China || 23m x 15m || 345 || 3714
|-
| USA || 60' x 36' || 201 || 2160
|-
| Canada || 60' x 35' || 195 || 2100
|}

In December 2011, the WDSF Open and the Australian Nationals were held at the Hisense Arena located within the Olympic park in Melbourne. The floor was at 84 by 37.7 meters which was 7.61 times the size of what WDSF requires.

=== Rules ===
The [[World Dance Council]] (WDC) rules for international competitions are lengthy and detailed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dancewdc.org/download/7eTsDviYCPXgCx6LN7itu9WLM/WDC%20Competition%20Rules%20current%20-%20June%202009.pdf World Dance Council]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The music for competitions is kept confidential until the event. The music always follows a strict tempo and, for a couples competition, it will have a duration of no less than 90 seconds, and no more than two minutes.

Some elementary competitions are restricted to "basic" steps, but international competitions are open as to [[choreography]], within the limits of the traditional style of the individual dances. Only the [[Viennese waltz]] has defined choreography: it is limited to seven well-specified figures. Lifts are not permitted, except for Show Dance titles. The tempo for each dance is defined. In the finals, couples are marked under the [[skating system]] and judged by timing, footwork, rise and fall, alignment, direction and floor craft. Competitors must meet [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] rules.

===Dancesport as an Olympic event===
After a long campaign, the [[World DanceSport Federation]] (WDSF), formerly IDSF, was recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]] as the sole representative body for dancesport, on September 5, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Daniel 1999. ''Qualifying for Olympic status: the process and implications for competitive ballroom dance''. Master's thesis, Brigham Young University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idsf.net/ ISDF]&lt;/ref&gt; At that point, many dance organisations changed their titles to incorporate the word ''sport''. This recognition gives the IDSF, potentially, a unique status. The WDSF website shows letters and certificates from the IOC that recognise dancesport as an eligible sport for inclusion pursuant to rule 29 of the Olympic Charter.&lt;ref name="ioc-letter"&gt;{{cite web |title=''Official Letter from Mr. Juan Antonio Samaranch'' |url=http://www.idsf.net/index.tpl?id=29 |accessdate=2010-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013040944/http://www.idsf.net/index.tpl?id=29 |archivedate=2010-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="ioc-certificate"&gt;{{cite web | title = ''Official IOC Certificate'' | url = http://www.idsf.net/index.tpl?id=30 | accessdate = 2010-09-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100626010044/http://www.idsf.net/index.tpl?id=30 | archivedate = 2010-06-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On its website, the IDSF gives an upbeat appraisal of the chances of dancesport being included in a future summer Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041017132959/http://www.idsf.net/press02/idsf0213.pdf |url=http://www.idsf.net/press02/idsf0213.pdf |title=IOC: Green Light for DanceSport|publisher=International DanceSport Federation|archivedate=2004-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, dancesport has not been included as an official event at the Olympics since its recognition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Olympic.org - Official website of the Olympic Movement |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/if/fi_uk.asp?id_federation=43 |title=International DanceSport Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are many who doubt that it ever will.&lt;ref&gt;McMain, Julie 2006.

===Physical demands===

Ballroom dancing is a partnered activity with a male and female counterpart. Over the years, competitive ballroom dancing has evolved so much in its choreography, requiring a higher level of athleticism. Many individuals that spectate or dance socially often underestimate the physical attributes and demands of ballroom dancing. In order to compete at a world level, elite competitive dancers undergo rigorous training to help and enhance their competition performance. These dancers seem to perform at such a high level of [[energy expenditure]] that a deeper understanding of these energy demands may help build specific training programs used to sustain a high quality dance performance consistent over a few rounds of a competition.

In 1988, an Australian study was conducted to determine the [[heart rate]] and estimated energy expended during ballroom dancing.&lt;ref name="Blanksby, B. A. and Reidy, P. W. June 22, 1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blanksby|first=B. A.|author2=Reidy, P. W.|title=Heart rate and estimated energy expenditure during ballroom dancing|journal=[[British Journal of Sports Medicine]]|date=June 1988|volume=22|issue=2|pages=57–60|pmid=3167503|pmc=1478556}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professors Blanksby and Reidy of the Department of Human Movement and Recreation Studies at the University of Western had ten competitive ballroom dance couples simulate a dancesport competition, dancing their competitive routines in either the Latin American or Standard division.&lt;ref name="Blanksby, B. A. and Reidy, P. W. June 22, 1988"/&gt; After administrating all required laboratory tests (in order to record their height, weight, body fat percentage, fat free mass and the resting/maximal heart rate and [[VO2 max|VO2]] values), the couples danced a five-dance final, given a 15 to 20 second break between each dance.&lt;ref name="Blanksby, B. A. and Reidy, P. W. June 22, 1988"/&gt; Throughout the final their heart rates were telemetered and recorded. The purpose of this study was to estimate the energy requirements from heart rates acquired during competition simulation and previously recorded measures of VO2 and HR.

The average heart rate for male dancers in Standard was 170 beats min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 168 beats min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in the Latin American.&lt;ref name="Blanksby, B. A. and Reidy, P. W. June 22, 1988"/&gt; Females elicited 179 beats min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 177 beats min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; respectively.&lt;ref name="Blanksby, B. A. and Reidy, P. W. June 22, 1988"/&gt; Astrand and Rodahl (1977) classify any exercise being extremely heavy if it results in a heart rate above 150 beats min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Textbook of Work Physiology. McGraw-HilBookCo.|author=Astrand, P.-O. and Rodahl, K.  (1977)|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also classify an exercise as extremely heavy if [[oxygen consumption]] is higher than 2.0L min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Textbook of Work Physiology. McGraw-HilBookCo.|author=Astrand, P.-O. and Rodahl, K.

A. and Reidy, P. W. June 22, 1988"/&gt; Finally, the energy expenditure for male athletes was estimated to be 54.1 ± 8.1 kJ min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for Standard and 54.0± 9.6kJ min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in the Latin American dances.&lt;ref name="Blanksby, B. A. and Reidy, P. W. June 22, 1988"/&gt; For females it was 34.7 ± 3.8 kJ min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 36.1 ± 4.1 kJ min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; respectively.&lt;ref name="Blanksby, B. A. and Reidy, P. W. June 22, 1988"/&gt;

Two other similar experiments were conducted exhibiting very similar results and analyses.&lt;ref name="Massidda, M. M., Cugusi L. C., Ibba M.

J., Johansen, L.J. (2001)| accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all three of the experiments, significant differences in the energy expenditure between the male and female athletes were noticed. Generally males had a higher energy expenditure than their female counterparts. This is evident due to the anthropometric differences between the two sexes and the oxygen transport capacity.&lt;ref name="Massidda, M. M., Cugusi L. C., Ibba M. I., Tradori l. t., Calò C, M,, December 11, 2011 206&amp;rft_id=info:pmid/22211197&amp;rft.externalDocID=22211197"/&gt;

Comparing the mean gross energy expenditures (in kJ min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) between ballroom dancing and other sports, it is evident that competitive dancing is equally as demanding in comparison to other sporting activities such as basketball (35.83 kJ min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) or cross-country running (44.37kJ min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) (Consolazioetal,1963),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Physiological Measurement of Metabolic Functions in Man. McGraw-Hill BookCo.|author=Consolazio, C.,Johnson, R. and Pecora, L., (1963)|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that ballroom dancing requires a [[cardiovascular system]] to be able to work at a high energy level in order to match the given physiological strain.

[[File:Doggerbank.jpg|thumb|right|Location of the [[Dogger Bank]] in the [[North Sea]].]]

The '''Dogger Bank incident''' (also known as the '''North Sea Incident''', the '''Russian Outrage''' or the '''Incident of Hull''') occurred on the night of 21/22 October 1904, when the [[Baltic Fleet]] of [[Imperial Russian Navy]] mistook a British [[Commercial trawler|trawler]] fleet from [[Kingston upon Hull]] in the [[Dogger Bank]] area of the [[North Sea]] for an [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] force and fired on them. Russian warships also fired on each other in the chaos of the melée.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|1911|p=275-286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three British fishermen died and a number were wounded. One sailor and a priest aboard a Russian cruiser caught in the crossfire were also killed. The incident almost led to war between Britain and Russia.&lt;ref name="WAROFRISINGSUN"&gt;{{harvnb|Connaughton|1988|p=247, 250 &amp; 259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==

The [[Battle of Tsushima#The Second Pacific Squadron|Russian warships]] involved in the incident were en route to the Far East, to reinforce the 1st Pacific Squadron stationed at [[Port Arthur naval base|Port Arthur]], and later [[Vladivostok]], during the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. Because of the fleet's alleged sightings of balloons and four enemy cruisers the day previously, coupled with "the possibility that the Japanese might surreptitiously have sent ships around the world to attack"&lt;ref name="Busch p. 90, 91"&gt;{{harvnb|Busch|1969|p=90, 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; them, the Russian admiral, [[Zinovy Rozhestvensky]], called for increased vigilance, issuing an order that "no vessel of any sort must be allowed to get in among the fleet".&lt;ref name="Busch p. 90, 91"/&gt;
[[File:Aurora 1903.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Aurora (cruiser)|Aurora]]'', a Russian cruiser attacked by other Russian ships during the incident.]]
[[File:Dogger Bank Russian Outrage incident 1904 St Andrews Dock, Hull postcard.jpg|thumb|Damaged trawlers after return to St Andrews Dock, Hull]]
It was known that enemy intelligence had been heavily active in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Busch|1969|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torpedo boats, a recent development of the major navies, had the potential to damage and sink large warships, and were very difficult to detect, causing psychological stress on sailors at war.

Similar accidents and rumours affected the Russian fleet: there was a general fear of attack, with widespread rumours that a fleet of Japanese torpedo boats were stationed off the Danish coast, talk of the Japanese having mined the seas, and alleged sightings of Japanese submarines. Before the Dogger Bank incident, the nervous Russian fleet fired on fishermen carrying consular dispatches from Russia  to them, near the Danish coast, without causing any damage due to their poor gunnery.&lt;ref name="HULL" /&gt;

After navigating a non-existent minefield, the Russian fleet sailed into the North Sea. The disaster of 21 October began in the evening, when the captain of the supply ship ''Kamchatka'' (Камчатка), which was last in the Russian line, took a passing [[Sweden|Swedish]] ship for a Japanese torpedo boat and radioed that he was being attacked. Later that night, during fog, the officers on duty sighted the British trawlers, interpreted their signals incorrectly and classified them as Japanese torpedo boats, despite being more than {{convert|20,000|mi|km||sigfig=1}} from Japan. The Russian warships illuminated the trawlers with their searchlights and opened fire. The British trawler ''Crane'' was sunk, and its captain and first mate were killed. Four other trawlers were damaged, and six other fishermen were wounded, one of whom died a few months later. As the trawlers had their nets down, they were unable to flee and, in the general chaos, Russian ships shot at each other: the cruisers [[Russian cruiser Aurora|''Aurora'']] and [[Russian armoured cruiser Dmitrii Donskoi|''Dmitrii Donskoi'']] were taken for Japanese warships and bombarded by seven battleships sailing in formation, damaging both ships and killing a chaplain and at least one sailor and severely wounding another. During the pandemonium, several Russian ships signalled torpedoes had hit them, and on board the battleship [[Russian battleship Borodino|''Borodino'']] rumours spread that the ship was being boarded by the Japanese, with some crews donning life vests and lying prone on the deck, and others drawing cutlasses. More serious losses to both sides were only avoided by the extremely low quality of Russian gunnery, with the battleship [[Russian battleship Oryol|''Oryol'']] reportedly firing more than 500 shells without hitting anything.&lt;ref name="HULL" /&gt; After twenty minutes' firing the fishermen saw a blue light signal on one of the warships, the order to cease firing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scarboroughsmaritimeheritage.org.uk/adoggerbank.php The dogger bank incident in 1904 – The Russian fleet attacks Hull trawlers] – [[Scarborough Maritime Heritage Centre]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The incident led to a serious diplomatic conflict between Russia and Britain, which was particularly dangerous due to the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]]. In the aftermath some British newspapers called the Russian fleet '[[pirates]]' and Admiral Rozhestvensky was heavily criticised for not leaving the British sailors lifeboats. The editorial of the morning's ''[[The Times|Times]]'' was particularly scathing: 
:''"It is almost inconceivable that any men calling themselves seamen, however frightened they might be, could spend twenty minutes bombarding a fleet of fishing boats without discovering the nature of their target."&lt;ref name="WAROFRISINGSUN"/&gt;''
[[File:Dogger Bank Proceedings.png|thumb|left|Session of the International Commission of Inquiry]]
[[File:Dogger Bank fishermen.png|thumb|left|British fishermen in Paris to testify before the Commission]]
The [[Royal Navy]] prepared for war, with 28 battleships of the [[Home Fleet]] being ordered to raise steam and prepare for action, while British cruiser squadrons shadowed the Russian fleet as it made its way through the [[Bay of Biscay]] and down the coast of [[Portugal]]. Under diplomatic pressure, the Russian government agreed to investigate the incident, and Rozhestvensky was ordered to dock in [[Vigo]], Spain, where he left behind those officers considered responsible (as well as at least one officer who had been critical of him).&lt;ref name="HULL"&gt;[http://www.hullwebs.co.uk/content/l-20c/disaster/dogger-bank/voyage-of-dammed.htm Dogger Bank – Voyage of the Damned] ('Hullwebs – History of Hull' website. Retrieved 8 September 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt; From Vigo, the main Russian fleet then approached [[Tangiers]], [[Morocco]], and lost contact with the ''Kamchatka'' for several days. The ''Kamchatka'' eventually rejoined the fleet and claimed that she had engaged three Japanese warships and fired over 300 shells: the ships she had actually fired at were a Swedish merchantman, a German trawler, and a French schooner. As the fleet left Tangiers, one ship accidentally severed the city's underwater telegraph cable with her anchor, preventing communications with Europe for four days.&lt;ref name="HULL"/&gt;

Due to concerns that the draught of the newer battleships (which had proven to be considerably greater than designed)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/officialhistoryn03grea|title=Official history, naval and military, of the Russo-Japanese War. Prepared by the Historical section of the Committee of Imperial Defence|last=Great Britain Committee of Imperial Defence|first=|publisher=His Majesty's Stationery Office|year=1920|isbn=|volume=III|location=|publication-place=London|pages=27-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; would prevent their passage through the Suez Canal, the fleet separated after leaving Tangiers on November 3, 1904.  The newer battleships and a few cruisers proceeded around the Cape of Good Hope under command of Admiral Rozhestvensky while the older battleships and lighter cruisers made their way through the Suez Canal under the command of Admiral von Felkerzam.  They planned to rendezvous in Madagascar and both sections of the fleet successfully completed this part of the journey&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  The fleet then proceeded to the [[Sea of Japan]] where it was soundly defeated in the [[Battle of Tsushima]].

On 25 November 1904, the British and the Russian governments signed a joint agreement in which they agreed to submit the issue to an international commission of inquiry whose proceedings were to be based on the Hague Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcourts.com/ici/eng/decisions/1904.11.25_doggerbank/index.htm Joint British-Russian declaration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013053249/http://www.worldcourts.com/ici/eng/decisions/1904.11.25_doggerbank/index.htm |date=13 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Commission met in Paris from 9 January to 25 February 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1974|p=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report produced by the International Commission concluded that: "the commissioners declare that their findings, which are therein formulated, are not, in their opinion, of a nature to cast any discredit upon the military qualities or the humanity of Admiral Rojdestvensky, or of the personnel of his squadron".  It also concluded as follows: "the commissioners take pleasure in recognising, unanimously, that Admiral Rozhestvensky personally did everything he could, from beginning to end of the incident, to prevent trawlers, recognised as such, from being fired upon by the squadron".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcourts.com/ici/eng/decisions/1905.02.26_doggerbank.htm Dogger Bank Incident Final Report]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:North Sea Incident 1904 - Memorial - geograph.org.uk - 264822.jpg|thumb|Fisherman's Memorial]]
Russia voluntarily paid a compensation of £66,000 to the fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Merills|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906 the Fisherman's Memorial was unveiled in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] to commemorate the deaths of the three British sailors. The approx. 18 feet high statue shows the dead fisherman George Henry Smith and carries the following inscription:

:''Erected by public subscription to the memory of George Henry Smith (skipper) and William Richard Legget (third hand), of the steam-trawler CRANE, who lost their lives through the action of the Russian Baltic Fleet in the North Sea, 22 October 1904, and Walter Whelpton, skipper of the trawler MINO, who died through shock, May 1905.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4106">'''Europe-Iran Forum''' is a series of events originally hosted by the Development Institute [[Paris]], [[BHB Emissary]] and [[European Voice]] magazine in 2014. The event's main goal is to act as a non-partisan meeting ground for European and Iranian businesses to discuss future cooperation post [[sanctions against Iran|sanctions]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europeiranforum2.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the historic [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|Joint Action Plan]] agreement reached by [[Iran]] and the Group [[P5+1]] in November 2013, a series of economic sanctions were lifted, rekindling commercial interest in Iran throughout Europe.&lt;ref name=9191**1424&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irna.ir/en/News/2771192/|accessdate=17 April 2015|agency=IRNA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event, a first of its kind to offer Iran as a potential investment destination garnered attention in the press including the [[BBC]]. The Europe-Iran forum is the first event created by the private sector to have the moral support from the government of President [[Hassan Rouhani]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BBC|title=Iran Forum Raises Eyebrows|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-29646763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scheduled speakers included Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising group WPP, as well as [[Jack Straw]] and Hubert Vedrine, former British and French foreign ministers respectively. The Forum also has the blessing of Rouhani, whose chief of staff has written a letter of support to the organizers, media company European Voice.

The first post-sanctions conference was held in [[Vienna]], Austria and second event has been slated for fall 2015 in the Swiss city of [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU Iran Forum 2|url=http://www.europeiranforum2.com/location/|website=EU Iran Forum 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event's stated goal is to provide a platform for both Iranian and [[international banking]] and finance groups to discuss future cooperation post-sanctions. 

The second forum was dubbed the Europe-Iran Forum, considering it was being held in the [[Swiss]] city of [[Geneva]], and not in a [[European Union]] country. 

==Notable speakers==

*'''[[Jack Straw]], former [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] British Foreign Secretary 
*'''[[Sir Martin Sorrell]], CEO of advertising agency [[WPP plc]]
*'''[[Rouzbeh Pirouz]], founder of the [[Iranian Business School]] and [[Turquoise Partners]]
*'''[[Neda Amidi]], associate of the [[Plug &amp; Play Tech Center]] in California
*'''[[Parviz Aghili]], CEO of [[Middle East Bank]]
*'''[[Dominique de Villepin]], former French foreign minister

==Criticism==

The event has come under heavy pressure from supporters of [[Israel]] for its pro-Iran stance. Israeli newspapers in 2014 slammed the event calling it a "travesty of the gravest proportions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Times of Israel|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-fumes-at-post-sanctions-iran-conference-in-london/|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gatestone Interview]] reviewed the first event stating "The Europe-Iran Forum marks Iran's preparations for a nuclear-capable Iran in a comfortable post-sanctions world, for which the regime is advocating in spite of its continued sponsorship of terror abroad and the oppression of its citizens at home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Westrop|first1=Samuel|title=UK: Iran Lobbies against Sanctions|url=http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4802/europe-iran-forum|website=Gatestone Institute|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leave this to Us Sonny Art.IWMPST13854.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The UK [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Health]] advertised the evacuation programme through posters, among other means. The poster depicted here was used in the [[London Underground]].]]

The '''evacuation of civilians in Britain during the Second World War''' was designed to protect people, especially children, from the risks associated with [[aerial bombing of cities]] by moving them to areas thought to be less at risk. '''Operation Pied Piper''', which began on 1 September 1939, officially relocated more than 3.5 million people. There were further waves of official evacuation and re-evacuation from the south and east coasts in June 1940, when a [[Operation Sealion|seaborne invasion]] was expected, and from affected cities after [[the Blitz]] began in September 1940. There were also official evacuations from the UK to other parts of the [[British Empire]], and many non-official evacuations within and from the UK. Other mass movements of civilians included British citizens [[Evacuation of civilians from the Channel Islands in 1940|arriving from the Channel Islands]], and [[displaced person|displaced people]] arriving from continental Europe.

The '''Government Evacuation Scheme'''  was developed during summer 1938 by the Anderson Committee and implemented by the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Health]]. The country was divided into zones, classified as either "evacuation", "neutral", or "reception", with priority evacuees being moved from the major urban centres and [[billet]]ed on the available private housing in more rural areas. Each zone covered roughly a third of the population, although several urban areas later bombed had not been classified for evacuation. In early 1939, the reception areas compiled lists of available housing. Space was found for about 2000 people, and the government also constructed camps which provided a few thousand additional spaces.

In summer 1939, the government began to publicise its plan through the local authorities. They had overestimated demand: only half of all school-aged children were moved from the urban areas instead of the expected 80%. There was enormous regional variation: as few as 15% of the children were evacuated from some urban areas, while over 60% of children were evacuated from [[Manchester]], [[Belfast]] and [[Liverpool]]. The refusal of the central government to spend large sums on preparation also reduced the effectiveness of the plan. In the event over 3,000,000 people were evacuated.

==Evacuation==

Almost 3.75 million people were displaced, with around a third of the entire population experiencing some effects of the evacuation. In the first three days of official evacuation, 1.5 million people were moved: 827,000 children of school age; 524,000 mothers and young children (under 5); 13,000 pregnant women; 70,000 disabled people and over 103,000 teachers and other 'helpers'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWevacuation.htm |title=Evacuation |publisher=Spartacus Educational |date= |accessdate=2010-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417080610/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWevacuation.htm |archivedate=17 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children were parted from their parents.

Goods as well as people were evacuated; organisations or departments departed the cities. Art treasures were sent to distant storage: The [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] collection spent the war at the [[Manod]] Quarry near [[Ffestiniog]], [[North Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hidden treasures |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northwest/sites/blaenau/pages/manodquarry.shtml |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bank of England]] moved to the small town of [[Overton, Hampshire]] and in 1939–40 moved 2,154 [[ton]]s of [[gold]] to the vaults of the [[Bank of Canada]] in [[Ottawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bank-banque-canada.ca/en/press/1997/pr97-3.html |title=Bank of Canada Releases Interim Report 1997 – Press Releases – Publications and Research – Bank of Canada |publisher=[[Bank of Canada]] |date= |accessdate=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/assets/documents/united_kingdom/boe.htm |title=Bank Of England Archive: Records On Wartime Gold Transactions |publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] |date=1997-11-17 |accessdate=2009-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508115900/http://www.ushmm.org/assets/documents/united_kingdom/boe.htm |archivedate=8 May 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]] moved variety production to Bristol and [[Bedford]] and moved senior staff to [[Wood Norton, Worcestershire|Wood Norton]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/sites/w/woodnorton/ Subterranea Britannica: Wood Norton Hall]&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Evesham, Worcestershire]]. Many senior [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|Post Office]] staff were relocated to [[Harrogate]]. Some private companies moved head offices or their most vital records to comparative safety away from major cities.

Government functions were also evacuated. Under "Plan Yellow",&lt;ref name="Cox1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cox |first=Noel |authorlink= |year=1998 |month= |title=The Continuity of Government in the face of enemy – the British experience, part 1 |journal=Forts and Works |volume=6 |issue= |pages=17–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cox |first=Noel |authorlink= |year=1999 |month= |title=The Continuity of Government in the face of enemy attack – the British experience, part 2 |journal=Forts and Works |volume=7 |issue= |pages=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; some 23,000 civil servants and their paperwork were dispatched to available hotels in the better coastal resorts and spa towns. Other hotels were requisitioned and emptied for a possible last-ditch "Black Move"&lt;ref name="Cox1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox1999"/&gt; should London be destroyed or threatened by invasion. Under this plan, the nucleus of government would relocate to the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]]—the [[War Cabinet]] and ministers would move to [[Hindlip Hall]], Bevere House and [[Malvern College]] near [[Worcester]] and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Where did the government go? |url=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/features/government/ |accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winston Churchill]] was to relocate to [[Spetchley Park]] whilst King [[George VI]] and other members of the royal family would take up residence at [[Madresfield Court]] near [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Madresfield Court: The King's redoubt if Hitler called |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8270238/Madresfield-Court-The-Kings-redoubt-if-Hitler-called.html |accessdate=2012-08-12 |location=London |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |first=Neil |last=Tweedie |date=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some strained areas took the children into local schools by adopting the [[First World War]] expedient of "double shift education"—taking twice as long but also doubling the number taught. The movement of teachers also meant that almost a million children staying home had no source of education.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

===Evacuation Centres===
[[File:Evacuees in the dining hall of Marchant's Hill School, Hindhead, Surrey, 1944. D21631.jpg|thumb|upright|Marchant's Hill School was an evacuation camp of wooden buildings built at [[Hindhead]] in Surrey. This is the dining hall in use in 1944.]]
In 1939 the British Government passed the Camps Act 1939&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=National Archives |title=Camps Act |url= http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/2-3/22 |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which established the [[National Camps Corporation]] as a body to design and build residential camps for young people, which could provide opportunities for outdoor learning and also act as evacuation centres in the event of war. The architect [[T. S. Tait]] was responsible for the design of the buildings, which included accommodation for over 200 children and staff, recreational halls, wash blocks and a dining hall/kitchen complex. These camps were replicated in over thirty different rural locations around the country. During the war years, they acted as safe refuges for city children. After the war the ownership of the sites was transferred to the local authorities. Over the years most of these sites have been lost, but the best preserved example today is [[Sayers Croft]] at [[Ewhurst, Surrey]]. The dining hall and kitchen complex is protected as a [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade II listed building]] because of the importance of Tait's work, and because of the painted murals depicting the life of the many evacuees. Evacuation Centres were also set up by the Foster Parent Plan (FPP) for Children Affected by War, later renamed [[Plan international]]. One evacuated school was sponsored by the FPP in Knutsford, Cheshire, with each child being financially supported by an American citizen. One female pupil was sponsored by Mrs [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mawson |first1=Gillian |title=Britain's Wartime Evacuees |date=2016 |publisher=Frontline Books |isbn=1-84832-441-3 |pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overseas Evacuation===
The [[Children's Overseas Reception Board]] (CORB) approved 24,000 children for evacuation overseas. Between June and September 1940, 1,532 children were evacuated to Canada, mainly through the [[Pier 21]] immigration terminal; 577 to Australia; 353 to South Africa and 202 to New Zealand. The scheme was cancelled after the {{SS|City of Benares||2}} was torpedoed on 17 September 1940, killing 77 of the 90 CORB children aboard. However, in 1940 and 1941 about 14,000 children were evacuated privately to overseas relatives or foster families, including 6,000 to Canada and 5,000 to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Calder |first=Angus |year=1969 |title=The People’s War: Britain 1939–45 |place=London |publisher=[[Jonathan Cape]] |page=139 |isbn=0-7126-5284-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other evacuations==
[[File:Don't do it Mother Art.IWMPST3095.jpg|thumb|upright|Some parents who missed their children were tempted to bring them back from evacuation. This [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Health]] poster was published to discourage them.]]
A second evacuation effort started during and after the fall of France. From 13 to 18 June 1940, around 100,000 children were evacuated (in many cases re-evacuated). Efforts were made to remove the vulnerable from coastal towns in southern and eastern England facing German-controlled areas. By July, over 200,000 children had been moved; some towns in [[Kent]] and East Anglia evacuated over 40% of the population. Also, some 30,000 people arrived from continental Europe and from 20 to 24 June 25,000 people arrived from the [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|Channel Islands]]. As thousands of Guernsey school children arrived in northern England with their teachers, some were allowed to re establish their schools in empty buildings. Guernsey's Forest School reopened in a church hall in Cheadle Hulme, Cheshire where it operated until August 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mawson |first1=Gillian |title=Guernsey Evacuees |date=2012 |publisher=History Press |isbn=978-0-7524-7019-1 |pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the speediest moves was accomplished by the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] when it transferred its headquarters out of London. The company took over [[The Grove, Watford|The Grove]], on the estate of the [[George Villiers, 6th Earl of Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon]] in Hertfordshire. This was made ready as offices and a number of huts built in the surrounding park. On 1 September 1939, it was decided to move in and the transfer was completed before war was declared two days later. Within three days some 3,000 of the staff were based at the new headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Michael |year=2013 |title=Steaming to Victory: How Britain's Railways Won the War |place=New York and London |publisher=[[Random House|Preface Publishing]] |isbn=1-84809-314-4 |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men of German (and later Italian) origin were interned from 12 May 1940. Many interned were refugees from Nazi Germany. By July, almost all of these men under 70 were held in military camps, mainly on the [[Isle of Man]]. At first, unnecessary mistreatment was common, but conditions soon improved. For many interned persons, conditions in the camps were not especially unpleasant.

Note the wartime [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]] mount in the background.]]
When [[the Blitz]] began in September ,1940, there were clear grounds for evacuation. Free travel and billeting allowance were offered to those who made private arrangements. They were also given to children, the elderly, the disabled, pregnant women, the ill and those who had lost their homes (some 250,000 in the first six weeks in London). By the combination of all the state and private efforts, London's population was reduced by almost 25%. As bombing affected more towns, "assisted private evacuation" was extended. However, not all evacuated children, mothers and teachers were safe in the areas to which they had been evacuated. Air raids, unexploded bombs, military vehicles and military minefields posed risks to the evacuees wherever they were posted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mawson |first1=Gillian |title=Britain's Wartime Evacuees |date=2016 |publisher=Frontline Books |isbn=1-84832-441-3 |pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;


London proved resilient to bombing despite the heavy bombardment. The destruction in the smaller towns was more likely to provoke panic and spontaneous evacuations. The number of official evacuees rose to a peak of 1.37 million by February 1941. By September, it stood at just over one million. By the end of 1943, there were just 350,000 people officially billeted. Still, the [[V-1 flying bomb]] attacks from June 1944 provoked another significant exodus from London. Up to 1.5 million people left by September — only 20% were "official" evacuees.

From September 1944, the evacuation process was officially halted and reversed for most areas except for London and the East coast. Returning to London was not officially approved until June 1945. In March 1946, the billeting scheme was ended, with 38,000 people still without homes.

==Cultural impact==
[[File:A group of young evacuees sit on a hay cart outside Chapel Cleeve Nursery in Washford, Somerset, 1942. D9209.jpg|thumb|upright|Evacuee children on a haycart at [[Old Cleeve|Chapel Cleeve]], Somerset in 1942]]
[[File:All Saints church, Sudbury - evacuees' gratitude stained glass window by Michael Stokes.jpg|thumb|upright|This stained glass window by Michael Stokes, in [[Sudbury, Derbyshire|All Saints church, Sudbury, Derbyshire]], was a gift from former Manchester evacuees to the community where they were looked after during the war]]
The movement of urban children of all [[class system|classes]] to unfamiliar rural locations, without their parents, had a major impact. The [[Evacuees Reunion Association]] was formed with the support of the [[Imperial War Museum]]. It provides opportunities for former evacuees to contribute and share evacuation experiences and for researchers to request information such as the long-term effects of evacuation upon children.

The evacuation spawned a whole literature of children's and young adult fiction. The convenience of the setting for the writer is clear, allowing the child heroes to have adventures in a strange, new world. Some of the authors, like [[Nina Bawden]], had themselves experienced evacuation.
 
*[[Kitty Barne]]'s [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]]-winning ''[[Visitors from London]]'' (1940) is an early novel about evacuees, set in [[Sussex]].
*In [[Richmal Crompton]]'s ''William and the Evacuees'' (1940), [[William Brown (fictional boy)|William Brown]] is envious of the special treats the evacuees receive and organizes an 'evacuation' of the village children.
*In [[C. S. Lewis]]'s novel, ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' (1950), the Pevensie children are evacuated from London to the stately manor that contains the wardrobe portal to [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]]. It is never stated in which part of England the house was situated.
*[[William Golding]]'s novel, ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' (1954), is about a planeful of evacuating children who are shot down over a tropical island.
*[[Michael Bond]]'s beloved children's book character, ''[[Paddington Bear]]'' (1958), is an anthropomorphised orphan bear, who —having stowed away from "Darkest Peru"— is found by a family at [[London Paddington station|Paddington railway station in London]], sitting on his suitcase with a note attached to his coat that reads, "Please look after this bear. Thank you." Bond has said that his memories of [[newsreel]]s showing trainloads of child evacuees leaving London during WWII, with labels around their necks and their possessions in small suitcases, prompted him to do the same for Paddington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-berkshire-16964890 |last=Midgley |first=Emma |title=Paddington Bear 'inspired by evacuees' says author Bond |publisher=[[BBC Online]] |date=13 February 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nina Bawden]]'s novel, ''[[Carrie's War]]'' (1973), is about Carrie and Nick, who encounter different religions when they are evacuated to [[Wales]].
*[[Noel Streatfeild]]'s novel, ''When the Sirens Wailed'' (1974), is about three evacuees and covers issues like rations for evacuees, relationship between evacuees and townspeople, and the problems encountered by those who stayed behind.
*[[Michael Morpurgo]]'s novel, ''Friend or Foe'' (1977), is about two evacuees who befriend the crew of a crashed German bomber hiding on [[Dartmoor]].
* [[Diana Wynne Jones]]'s novel, ''[[A Tale of Time City]]'' (1987) begins with the main character, Vivian, being evacuated from London. Jones herself was evacuated to Wales in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.suberic.net/dwj/bio.html |title=Chrestomanci Castle: Something About the author |publisher=Diana Wynne Jones |date= |accessdate=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Michelle Magorian]]'s novel, ''[[Goodnight Mister Tom]]'' (1981), tells the story of the evacuee Willie Beech and elderly Thomas Oakley with whom he is billeted. It was made into a TV film starring [[John Thaw]] as Mr Tom.
*In the Disney sequel to ''[[Peter Pan]]'', ''[[Return to Neverland]]'', Wendy Darling's children Jane and Daniel are to prepare for evacuation before Jane is kidnapped by Captain Hook. The introduction to the movie details about the evacuation order and how children need Peter Pan now more than ever.
*[[Kit Pearson]]'s Guests of War trilogy, beginning with ''[[The Sky Is Falling (Pearson novel)|The Sky Is Falling]]'' (1989), chronicles the story of ten-year-old Norah Stoakes and her younger brother Gavin, who are evacuated to Toronto.

[[File:London Evacuees in Carmarthenshire, Wales, 1940 D1050.jpg|thumb|Boys from [[Rotherhithe Nautical School]] in [[Bermondsey]] doing boat drill at [[Ferryside]] in [[Carmarthenshire]] in 1940]]
Novels for adults featuring evacuation and evacuees are:

*''[[Put Out More Flags]]'' by [[Evelyn Waugh]], in which Waugh's anti-hero Basil Seal uses his position as Billeting Officer to extort bribes (for moving disruptive children elsewhere) from hapless and reluctant hosts.
*[[Noel Streatfeild]]'s adult novel ''Saplings'' (1945) 
*[[Connie Willis]]'s two-volume novel, ''[[Blackout/All Clear]]'' (2010) has extensive chapters about a [[time travel]]ling character from the future, a historian named Merope (she takes on the persona of Eileen O'Reilly, an Irish maid), who intends to study the impact of evacuation on the children. When she becomes stranded in the past, she eventually adopts two bratty children to raise herself.

Non-fiction:

*''Out of Harm's Way'' by [[Jessica Mann]] (Headline Publishers 2005) tells the story of the overseas evacuation of children from Britain in the Second World War.
*In [[Pam Hobbs]]'s memoir ''Don't Forget to Write: the true story of an evacuee and her family'' (2009), a 10-year-old is evacuated in 1940 from Leigh-on-Sea, Essex to Derbyshire, where she lives with a number of families and encounters a range of receptions from love to outright hostility – and enormous cultural differences.
*Alan Derek Clifton published his memories of being evacuated to Northern Rhodesia in 1940 in the book entitled, ''From Cockney to Colonial (And Back Again)'' (2010).
*[[Ben Wicks]]'s ''No Time to Wave Goodbye'' and ''The Day They Took the Children''
*''Britain's Wartime Evacuees'' by [[Gillian Mawson]] (Pen and Sword, 2016) shares the personal testimony of child and adult evacuees in Britain during the Second World War

Other:

*In the [[20th Century Fox]] movie, ''[[On the Sunny Side (1942 film)|On the Sunny Side]]'' (1942), [[Roddy McDowall]] portrays an evacuated English boy who comes to live with an American family in Ohio.
*[[Stephen Poliakoff]]'s television drama, ''[[Perfect Strangers (BBC TV series)|Perfect Strangers]]'' (2001), includes a lengthy flashback of two evacuated sisters who leave the family they are sent to and live as wild children in the woods for the remainder of the war.
*In the movie, ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' (1971), the evacuated children are taken in by a good witch-in-training.
*In the movie, ''[[The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death]]'' (2014), the major plot of the film involves a headmistress and a teacher evacuating a group of children out of London.  One of the children lost his parents in a Blitz.

[[File:Filmový festival Fakulty informatiky - Vítězové 2015.jpg|thumb|Award ceremony (2015)]]
A short films no longer than eight minutes can take part in the festival. The films have to be produced by students of Masaryk University in the last three years. Most of the films are made in the current academic year, in the courses ''Základy filmové řeči'' (Basics of film discourse) and ''Produkce audiovizuálního díla'' (Production of audiovisual artefacts) lectured by [[Petr Sojka]], [[Robert Král]] and [[Radovan Hakl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.online.muni.cz/student/3527-mate-v-supliku-kratky-film-prihlaste-ho-na-festival Máte v šuplíku krátký film? Přihlaste ho na festival]&lt;/ref&gt; In these courses students learn basic filmmaking knowledge, starting with ideas and story for the film, creating [[screenplays]], filming, production and [[postproduction]]. Students also handle acting, sounds, costumes and makeup by themselves.

Every year about twenty films are presented. The best of them are awarded in two categories: Professional jury's choice and Visitor's choice awards. The winners are awarded the [[Filmobolos]] trophy and win prizes from sponsors of the festival.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The festival is organized by students themselves. Every year a new [[motto]] and visual style is presented in the form of [[posters]], [[pamphlets]] and DVDs. Students have to raise money from various sponsors, they handle [[public relations]], create a [[trailer (promotion)|trailer]] and propagation materials, and take care of the official website and social media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
Organization of the first film festival in 2001 was motivated by the faculty's new possibility of [[digital media|digital]] video processing and students' interest in making their own films.

The fourth year of festival (2004) was promoted and sponsored for the first time. The beginning of festival was connected with the release of 10th anniversary of [[Faculty of Informatics]] DVD.

The fifth year (2005) was attended by more than 500 visitors.

In 2006 the festival offered various film genres such as documentary films, sci-fi, [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] and comedy. The absolute winner was ''Relace'' (Broadcast), a film by Stanislav Hrabí.

Year after, in 2007, a film called ''Krajina za duhou'' (The Land Over the Rainbow) by Lukáš Horáček was chosen as the winner of the Visitor's choice award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amper.ped.muni.cz/~jonas/bujobrothers/krajina_ct1.wmv Krajina za duhou], Dobré ráno s Českou televizí, 5. dubna 2007, 06:22–06:30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bujobrothers.wz.cz/krajina.htm Bujo Brothers: ''Krajina za duhou'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Jury chose a romantic film ''Neznámý'' (Stranger) by Martina Mičovičová and Michal Oravec as the best.

In 2008 the festival took place during [[Dies Academicus]], in the light of Masaryk University's anniversary. Actors from [[JAMU]] also took part this year and thus cooperation with other faculties had begun.

The winner of 9th year was Martin Kacvinský with his film ''Vir CRT-2116 a jeho přemožitel'' (CRT-2116 Virus and His Defeater). In the bonus section, lecturer Robert Král introduced his film ''Doprdelesvěta!'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 9.

In the 10th year the festival was visited by over 700 people. The first prize was awarded to a comedy by Michaela Miovská and Martin Bakeš named ''Nebylo nebylo – Jak by asi vypadaly pohádky, kdyby zmizeli kladní hrdinové'' (Not Once Upon a Time – How Would It Look Like If There Were No Heroes). The jury chose [[Stop motion|stop-motion]] film ''(L)egoist'' by Miroslav Kolárik as their film of choice. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 10.

In 2011 films were presented with [[English subtitles]] for the first time. The winners were ''Mrkvička'' (A Carrot) — an animation by Jiří Starý, and a stop-motion film ''Don't Stay Outside'' by Tomáš Kněžek.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.online.muni.cz/student/2200-na-filmovem-festivalu-fakulty-informatiky-bodovaly-animace Na filmovém festivalu fakulty informatiky bodovaly animace]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Motto]] of the 12th festival was ''Film máme v krvi'' (Film Is in Our Blood).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moviescreen.cz/filmove-novinky/brno-hosti-prehlidku-studentskych-filmu Brno hostí přehlídku studentských filmů]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.online.muni.cz/student/2955-informatici-maji-film-v-krvi Informatici mají film v krvi]&lt;/ref&gt; This year's winner was Radek Gomola with his 90's [[Role-playing game|RPG]]-stylized [[Stop motion|stop-motion]] film ''Epic Quest I''. The jury chose fake [[Wikipedia]] documentary ''Lež.org'' (Lie.org) by Radim Urbášek and Tomáš Hůsek as the best one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentpoint.cz/291-festivaly-akce/7022-film-mame-v-krvi-aneb-xii.-filmovy-festival-fakulty-informatiky-mu "Film máme v krvi" aneb XII. filmový festival fakulty informatiky MU]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 13th festival was stylized in the like of Hollywood [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = XIII. ročník Filmového festivalu Fakulty informatiky|url = http://www.kult.cz/divadlo-kino-hudba/detail/267070/|website = Kult.cz|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black (brown) comedy ''Shit Happened'' by Jan Kutil won the Visitor's choice award. ''Jana,'' a documentary drama based on real events which happened during the [[Prague Spring]], by Zdeňka Sitová was awarded Jury's choice award. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Výsledky hlasování z Filmového festivalu Fakulty informatiky MU|url = http://festival.fi.muni.cz/archiv/13/vysledky.html|website = festival.fi.muni.cz|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''...a přece se točí!'' (...and yet it's being shot!) was the motto of the 14th festival held on May 15, 2014 during the 95th anniversary of [[Masaryk University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = XIV.

The 15th festival was held on May 15, 2015. This year's motto was ''Střih!'' (Cut!) as a homage to all [[Film editing|film editors]]. Modern interpration of a classic Greek myth [[Pygmalion (mythology)|''Pygmalion'']], a comedy of the same name directed by Tomáš Schmidl, was awarded the Jury's choice award. The visitor's choice award went to ''Shitman: A New Hero Is Born'' — a parody of Hollywood blockbuster trailers, directed by Samuel Briškár. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Antické drama a superhrdinský akčňák ovládly festival FI|url = http://www.online.muni.cz/student/6122-anticke-drama-a-superhrdinsky-akcnak-ovladly-festival-fi#.Vmfmb3qLe1F|website = online.muni.cz|accessdate = 2015-12-09|language = cs-CZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 15.

The 16th festival was held on May 20, 2015. For the first time ever, the screenings took place at the Faculty of Informatics and simultaneously at the University cinema Scala in Brno. The motto was slightly provocational, asking people whether they would want to experience the films themselves — ''Chceš to taky?'' (Do you want it too?). The visitor's choice award went to ''Vysněná Domácnost'' (Dreamed Household) — a comedy by M. Humaj. The Jury's choice award was given to ''cute_cats.avi'', an experimental piece by J. Szlauer and J. Špiřík.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 16. Filmový festival FI MU|url = http://festival.fi.muni.cz/page/show/13|website = festival.fi.muni.cz|accessdate = 2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 2017, the 17th festival - the second one, which was screened at both Faculty of Informatics and University cinema Scala, took place. The number of people attending this year was speculated to be the highest among festivals so far&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Návštevníci filmového festivalu študentov informatiky zaplnili sály fakulty aj kina Scala|url = http://www.munimedia.cz/prispevek/navstevnici-filmoveho-festivalu-studentov-informatiky-zaplnili-saly-fakulty-aj-kina-scala-12564/|website = www.munimedia.cz|accessdate = 2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
, as people came to "Move the Picture" (this year's motto). The winner of the visitor's choice award was ''Gin'', a short philosophically-comedic sketch by František Kovařík. The Jury's choice award went to ''Co se dělo ve škole?'' (What happened in school?), a multi-genred sketch directed by Lýdie Palečková.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 17.

18th festival took place on 18th May, 2018. Like every year, there were screening of short films from students of Masaryk University as well as graduates. The festival screening took place at two locations simultaneously - at Faculty of Informatics and University cinema Scala. The winner of the visitor's price was Pavel Čadek's "Nelajkla mi status" and the Jury's choice award won film "Šelma". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 18?|url = http://lemma.fi.muni.cz/blog-post/show/41|website = lemma.fi.muni.cz|accessdate = 2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Garden Party'''" is a [[1972 in music|1972]] hit song written by [[Ricky Nelson|Rick Nelson]] and recorded by him and the Stone Canyon Band on the album ''[[Garden Party (album)|Garden Party]]''. The song tells the story of Nelson being booed off the stage at a concert at [[Madison Square Garden]].

== The concert ==
On October 15, 1971, Richard Nader's Rock 'n Roll Revival concert was given at Madison Square Garden in [[New York City]]. The playbill included many greats of the early rock era, including [[Chuck Berry]], [[Bo Diddley]], and [[Bobby Rydell]].

Nelson came on stage dressed in the then-current fashion, wearing [[bell-bottoms]] and a purple velvet shirt, with his hair hanging down to his shoulders. He started playing his older songs like "[[Hello Mary Lou]]", but then he played [[the Rolling Stones]]' "[[Honky Tonk Women#Country Honk|Country Honk]]" (a country version of their hit song "[[Honky Tonk Women]]") and the crowd began to boo. While some reports say that the booing was caused by police action in the back of the audience, Nelson took it personally and left the stage. He watched the rest of the concert backstage and did not reappear on stage for the finale.

== The song ==
"Garden Party" tells of various people who were present, frequently in an oblique manner ("[[Yoko Ono|Yoko]] brought her [[I Am the Walrus|Walrus]]", referring to Yoko Ono and [[John Lennon]]), with a chorus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
But it's all right now, I've learned my lesson well&lt;br&gt;
You see, you can't please everyone, so you've got to please yourself
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One more reference in the lyrics pertains to a particularly mysterious and legendary audience member: "Mr. Hughes hid in Dylan's shoes, wearing his disguise". The Mr. Hughes in question was ex-Beatle [[George Harrison]], who was a next-door neighbor and good friend of Nelson's. Harrison used "Hughes" as his traveling alias, and "hid in Dylan's shoes" most likely refers to an album of [[Bob Dylan]] covers that Harrison was planning but never recorded. "Wearing his disguise" also suggests that Harrison traveled incognito.

The phrases "Out stepped Johnny B. Goode / Playing guitar, like a-ringing a bell" refer to Chuck Berry and his song, "[[Johnny B. Goode]]".

== Charts ==
"Garden Party" reached number six on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in the fall of 1972; it was Nelson's last top 40 hit on the pop charts. The song also topped the ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|easy listening chart]] for two weeks&lt;ref&gt;[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (1996). ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits'', 6th Edition (Billboard Publications)&lt;/ref&gt; and reached number 44 on Billboard's Country Singles chart.

==Covers==
Country singer [[Johnny Lee (singer)|Johnny Lee]] recorded a [[cover version]] of the song in the late 1970s, entitled "Country Party", with slightly altered lyrics. [[Dwight Yoakam]] has also performed it live in concert. In 2000 [[Tarsha Vega]] sampled "Garden Party" in her song "Be Ya Self" for the soundtrack for [[The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle]]. 

The UK band, [[Smokie_(band)|Smokie]], recorded a cover of the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smokie Garden Party|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwnvIqkrYzg|website=YouTube|publisher=Smokie|accessdate=26 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[John Fogerty]] recorded the song with the Eagles' [[Don Henley]] and [[Timothy B. Schmit]], for his ''[[The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again]]'' album.

In 2012, Adam Young of [[Owl City]] covered the song and released it to his SoundCloud and personal blog followers. The song was pulled off of SoundCloud in late 2015, but can still be found on YouTube.

On December 31, 2012, [[Phish]] opened their New Year's Eve concert with the song at Madison Square Garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phish.net/setlists/?d=2012-12-31 |title=Setlists |publisher=Phish.net |date= |accessdate=2014-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phish bassist and singer Mike Gordon, who sang lead on the tune, wore a shirt very reminiscent of the one George Harrison wore on the cover of ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.

[[Gary Pig Gold]] recorded his own personal take on the song, which reflected an encounter with Rick himself and appeared, in 2013, on Pop Garden Radio's [https://web.archive.org/web/20140812204730/http://popgardenradio.com/legacy-a-tribute-to-rick-nelson Legacy: A Tribute to Rick Nelson Volume 1] CD.

'''''Germany's Aims in the First World War''''' (German title: Griff nach der Weltmacht: Die Kriegzielpolitik des kaiserlichen Deutschland 1914–1918) is a book by German Historian [[Fritz Fischer]]. It is one of the leading contributions to historical analysis of the [[causes of World War I]], and along with this work ''[[War of Illusions]]'' ''(Krieg der Illusionen)'' gave rise to the "Fischer Thesis" on the causes of the war. The title translates as "Grab for World Power".&lt;ref&gt;Trachtenberg, Marc, History and strategy, 1st ed, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-02343-3}}, p49&lt;/ref&gt; or "Bid for World Power".&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-professor-fritz-fischer-1132151.html |title=Obituary: Professor Fritz Fischer - Arts &amp; Entertainment |publisher=The Independent |date= 1999-12-13|accessdate=2009-11-15 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially Fischer attempts to link together a continuum of German belligerence in their "grab for power" weaving it all together into a cohesive theme of German ''Weltpolitik''.&lt;ref&gt;''Weltpolitik'' appeared previous to the First World War, shortly following unification and industrialization. It was employed by various groups and its true meaning has never be explicated at length or solely defined by anyone. Taken literally, the term Weltpolitik translates to ‘world politic” or ‘world policy.’ In this regard, it signified German foreign policy on the global stage. Often quoted by historians, Weltpolitik generally refers to German diplomatic efforts starting around 1890 up until the First World War, which were characterized by German political assertiveness and aggression. More accurately perhaps, Weltpolitik encompassed the outward expansion and securing of German industrial markets for which colonialism/imperialism were a part. It is frequently attributed to Admiral Tipitz’s naval policies, subsumed of course by the naval war race. For more on the manifestation and implementation of the term Weltpolitik during the years 1890 through 1902, see: Konrad Canis, ''Von Bismarck zur Weltpolitik: Deutsche Aussenpolitik 1890 bis 1902'' (Oldenbourg: Akademie Verlag, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
''Griff nach der Weltmacht'' was published in October 1961. It was published in Britain under the title ''Germany's Aims in the First World War'' in 1967, translated by C.A. Macartney with an introduction by James Joll.&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt;
The book included a memorandum by the then German Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg dated 9 September 1914 which set out a plan for Germany to dominate Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Paul, Themes in modern European history, 1890-1945, p115&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Fischer argued that Germany had a policy of deliberately provoking war during July 1914 and that during the war Germany developed a set of annexationist war aims similar to those of [[Adolf Hitler]] during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Stibbe, Matthew, The Fischer Constrovery over German War aims in the First World War and  its reception by East German Historians 1961-1989, The Historical Journal, 46, 3 (2003), pp. 649–668&lt;/ref&gt; On publication, the book caused controversy in [[West Germany]] as it challenged the view that Hitler was an aberration by emphasising the continuity in German foreign policy in 1914 and 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacksacademy.net/content/3496.html |title=The Causes of the First World War: The Fritz Fischer thesis |publisher=Blacksacademy.net |date=1912-12-08 |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was also controversial for challenging the established view that Germany did not bear the primary responsibility for outbreak of the war, the so-called "war guilt lie". Fischer also claimed that German elites had wanted war since as early as 1902.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uweb.ucsb.edu/~zeppelin/originsww1.htm |title=WWI Origins |publisher=Uweb.ucsb.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014055359/http://www.uweb.ucsb.edu/~zeppelin/originsww1.htm |archivedate=2009-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic reaction==
The historian John Moses stated in his 1975 work ''The Politics of Illusion'' that "No serious German historian today can venture to pit himself against the evidence compiled by the Fischer school."&lt;ref&gt;Moses, John, The Politics of Illusion, (London, 1975) p127&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer inspired several disciples, including the historian [[Imanuel Geiss]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; However, Fischer was ridiculed by conservative German historians who created a backlash against his ideas.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The most notable critic was conservative historian and patriot [[Gerhard Ritter]], who is said to have broken down in tears when lecturing on Fischer's line of argument in ''Griff nach der Weltmacht''.&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt; Fischer's ideas were welcomed by historians in communist [[East Germany]]; [[Fritz Klein (historian)|Fritz Klein]] considered Fischer's views to be uncontroversial.&lt;ref&gt;Joll James, Martel, Gordon, The Origins of the First World War, Longman, 3rd ed, p6&lt;/ref&gt;

Mombauer argues that Fischer's work led to greater discussion of the Holocaust by German history professors.&lt;ref&gt;Annika Mombauer, The origins of the First World War: controversies and consensus (London, 2002), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of German and British historians find the assertions of Fischer a glaring oversimplification of how the First World War developed, arguing that is decidedly disingenuous given the complexity of the situation as a whole - especially since parts of the evidence for German war aims (i.e. belligerence) from before the Great War were collected amid the fringe writings of Pan-Germans or were parceled together from Kaiser Wilhelm's rantings; none of which constituted official state policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Niall|title=The Pity of War: Explaining World War I|year=1998|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-465-05712-8|pages=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen A. Schuker]], writing in 2015, notes that although Fischer's book aroused great controversy when it was published, "Fischer's work made its way. Refinements by Immanuel Geiss, [[John C. G. Röhl|John Röhl]], [[Holger Afflerbach]], [[Annika Mombauer]], and others have confirmed the essentials".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen A. Schuker, '[https://collab.its.virginia.edu/access/content/group/856958a4-f453-4a35-b759-ae92fbab1e7f/Online%20Materials/Old%20Wine%20in%20New%20Bottles.%20Review%20of%20Christopher%20Clark_s%20Sleepwalkers.%20The%20New%20Criterion%2C%20Jan%202015.pdf Old wine in new bottles]', ''The New Criterion'' (January 2015), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35840">In July 2010, the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC) Guangzhou Committee, in a written proposal to mayor of [[Guangzhou]] [[Wan Qingliang]], suggested increasing [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] programming on [[Guangzhou Television]]'s main and news channels.&lt;ref name="nddaily10-07-06a"&gt;{{cite news

==Background==

===Mandarin as the official language===
Beijing made Mandarin the nation's sole official language in 1982, leading to bans on other languages at many radio and television stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2010/08/02/2003479394 Taipei Times]: ''Protesters rally in China, Hong Kong over local dialect'' Retrieved on 2010-08-02.&lt;/ref&gt; This status was confirmed by  the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Standard Spoken and Written Chinese Language, which went into effect on January 1, 2001. This law implements the provision in the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] that the state promotes nationwide use of the language.&lt;ref name="law-on-lang"&gt;{{cite web|title=Law of the People's Republic of China on the Standard Spoken and Written Chinese Language (Order of the President No.37)

===Use of Cantonese on television===
Due to Mandarin's status as the official language, use of the country's other languages in television as well as radio and film is rigorously restricted by the [[State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television]] (SARFT).&lt;ref name="sarft-1"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permission from national or local authorities is required for using a dialect as the primary programming language at radio and television stations.&lt;ref name="sarft-2"/&gt;

In 1988, the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, predecessor of the SARFT, approved the use of Cantonese by [[Guangdong TV]] in GDTV Pearl River Channel and Guangzhou TV as a countermeasure against the influence of [[Hong Kong]] television in the [[Pearl River Delta]] region.&lt;ref name="nddaily10-07-06a"/&gt; [[Southern Television Guangdong|TVS-*]] (TVS2 in Guangdong) is another major channel in China offering Cantonese programming and is the only Cantonese channel permitted to be broadcast worldwide via satellite.

===Decline of Cantonese in younger generations===
Despite having been approved for use in local television, Cantonese still faces restrictions and challenges in other aspects of social activities, which contributes to the decline of the language, particularly in the younger generations.

In elementary and secondary schools, the [[medium of instruction]] is mandated by law to be Mandarin.&lt;ref name="law-on-lang"/&gt; Use of Mandarin is also ubiquitously promoted in schools. In contrast, few, if any, local schools offer classes on Cantonese, although this is not explicitly forbidden by law.

In the past few years, there have been a number of newspaper reports about students in Guangzhou being punished for speaking Cantonese in school and even outside the classroom.&lt;ref name="montrealgazette10-07-26"&gt;{{cite news

Also contributing to the decline is the influx of [[Migrant worker|migrant population]] into Guangzhou as a result of the city's economic and developmental advantages in the country. The migrant worker population in China is estimated to be a huge 250 million, with most of them in big cities like Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rapoza|first1=Kenneth|title=Chinese Migrant Workers Enticed To Stay Home|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2013/02/19/china-migrant-workers-enticed-to-stay-home/|website=Forbes|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guangdong is the major destination of migrant workers in China, there is estimated to be over 20 million migrant workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lei|first1=Wu|title=China attempts to deal with large number of migrant workers|url=http://english.cntv.cn/2014/07/11/VIDE1405057803437679.shtml|website=CCTV|publisher=CCTV|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to authorities, a big part of the migrant workers in Guangdong province come from Hunan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Qiu|first1=Quanlin|title=Guangzhou helps migrant workers from Hunan|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2013-04/26/content_16453994.htm|website=China Daily|publisher=China Daily|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Increase of non-Cantonese-speaking population in the city leads to an increased number of non-Cantonese-speaking teachers in schools, forcing students to speak Mandarin on more occasions than Cantonese.&lt;ref name="nddaily10-07-09b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian10-07-25"&gt;{{cite news

[[Guangxi]], the neighbor province, used to be a Cantonese-speaking area, especially in the capital [[Nanning]]. Since the promotion of Putonghua from the 1990s, the number of Cantonese speakers has been dropped to less than 30% according to an unofficial statistic years later, most of who are the elder generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ycwb.com/epaper/ycwb/html/2010-07/13/content_874187.htm 《推普的"南宁现象"》] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430171111/http://www.ycwb.com/epaper/ycwb/html/2010-07/13/content_874187.htm |date=2011-04-30 }}，《羊城晚报》，2010年7月13日。&lt;/ref&gt;
Besides the decline of Cantonese in Guangzhou, there is also fear of Cantonese declining in Hong Kong. Stephen Matthews, an associate professor of linguistics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong commented that "It is difficult to calculate the timing but in the medium- to long run, Cantonese is an endangered language". He added "It might survive for 50 years or so but after 50 years it may well be on its way out". Thomas Lee, professor of linguistics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong doesn't believe the situation is as stark, but maintains that Cantonese needs to stay in the mainstream education or it will end up like Shanghainese, now spoken by less than 50% of the Shanghainese people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parry|first1=Simon|title=Decline of Cantonese|url=http://www.chinadailyasia.com/news/2012-05/16/content_113852.html|website=China Daily|publisher=China Daily|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even as far away as overseas, the Chinatowns have seen Cantonese being pushed out by Mandarin, reflecting different immigration patterns. Peter Kwong, professor of Asian American studies at Hunter College in New York City commented that "Mandarin's ascent comes with the realignment of power in Chinese-American communities, where the recent (non-Cantonese) immigrants are gaining economic and political clout".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Semple|first1=Kirk|title=In Chinatown, Sound of the Future Is Mandarin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/22/nyregion/22chinese.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|website=NYTimes|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earlier moves by Guangzhou TV in adopting Mandarin===
In 2009, Guangzhou TV shifted its Financial Channel from Cantonese to Mandarin at a cost of 30 million [[Renminbi|yuan]].&lt;ref name="guardian10-07-25"/&gt; Following the transition, viewership of the channel plummeted from 0.34 to 0.09.&lt;ref name="xinhua10-07-09a"&gt;{{cite news

==CPPCC Guangzhou Committee proposal==

===Survey===
Prior to submission of the proposal to the local government, in June 2010, the CPPCC Guangzhou Committee conducted an online survey on GZTV's broadcasting on its website. In response to a question concerning increasing Mandarin programming, of the 30,000 respondents, among whom two thirds were Guangzhou natives, a dominating 79.5% opposed the increase in favor of maintaining the current Cantonese-to-Mandarin ratio, while only a meager 19.5% were in support.&lt;ref name="xinhua10-07-09b"&gt;{{cite news

===Proposal===
In spite of opposition expressed through the survey, in July 2010, the CPPCC Guangzhou Committee officially submitted a proposal titled ''Suggestions on Further Enhancing Construction of [[2010 Asian Games|Asian Games]] Soft Environment'' to Guangzhou mayor Wan Qingliang, which explicitly voiced that Guangzhou TV should increase Mandarin programming by either adopting Mandarin as its primary programming language or converting all prime-time programs into using Mandarin and serving reruns in Cantonese.&lt;ref name="nddaily10-07-06a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="timeweekly10-07-14"/&gt;

&lt;div style="width: 80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
{{cquote|We suggest converting the Guangzhou TV's Main and news channels into a channel with Mandarin as the primary programming language, or changing prime-time programming of these channels into using Mandarin.|author=CPPCC Guangzhou Committee|source=at a conference on about Further Planning of Asian Games Soft Environment}}
&lt;/div&gt;

===Proposal rationale===
{{rquote|right|For Guangzhou to reach out nationwide, Guangzhou TV must use Mandarin.|Ji Keguang, vice-chair of proposal committee of CPPCC Guangzhou Committee|in words to mayor Wan Qingliang}}

In explaining the rationale for the proposal, the CPPCC Guangzhou Committee cited allowing satellite broadcasting of Guangzhou TV programs, an idea supported by 82.1% of the respondents in the online survey, as the main reason. Among municipal television stations of the five [[National central city|Major Cities]] named by the Chinese [[Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development]], Guangzhou TV is the only one whose main channel is not broadcast nationwide via satellite, because the majority of its programs are in Cantonese, while Mandarin programming is one of the requirements of SARFT approval for nationwide broadcasting. The CPPCC Guangzhou Committee also asserted that only if Guangzhou TV achieved nationwide broadcasting would Guangzhou live up to its status as a Chinese Major City, and it would also facilitate more people to know about Guangzhou.&lt;ref name="timeweekly10-07-14"/&gt;

==Reactions==

===Reactions of local citizens and netizens===
Responses to the CPPCC Guangzhou Committee's proposal were generally negative, especially those from local citizens and [[netizen]]s; only a minority of reactions were positive.&lt;ref name="nddaily10-07-06a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="xinhua10-07-09b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nddaily10-07-06b"&gt;{{cite news

===Reactions of notable personalities===
Han Zhipeng, a member of the CPPCC Guangzhou Committee, expressed his opposition after release of the proposal, saying, "Cantonese is the carrier of [[Lingnan culture]], and the [[mother tongue]] of Guangdong people; it is also a bond connecting [[overseas Chinese]], for most of them speak only Cantonese." He further suggested introducing a new Mandarin channel instead of reducing Cantonese programming.&lt;ref name="nddaily10-07-06a"/&gt;

Zeng Zhi, director of GZTV's General Editor Office, questioned satellite broadcasting as a motivation for GZTV shifting to Mandarin, saying that nationwide broadcasting was a complicated and difficult issue, and might not be attained even if Cantonese was ditched.&lt;ref name="nddaily10-07-06a"/&gt;

[[Chen Yang (TV Host)|Chen Yang]], who is celebrated by local television audience for his blunt criticism of government policies and behaviors when hosting ''News Eyes'' for GZTV since the show's inception in February 2004 until being forced to leave in December 2008, sighed, "Cantonese is in degeneracy... Behind a dialect forced into extinction there must be a weakened culture."&lt;ref name="nddaily10-07-06a"/&gt;

Zhan Bohui, honorary director of [[Jinan University]]'s Chinese Dialect Research Centre, defended the proposal, declaring that increasing Mandarin was to cater to the migrant population in Guangzhou, to whom Cantonese was unintelligible.&lt;ref name="nddaily10-07-06a"/&gt;

Ji Keguang, the most prominent proponent of the proposal, when requested for comment on the 90% agreement to Cantonese programming in the online survey, responded with "They need guidance", which eventually put him at the center of criticism from local citizens and netizens. Ji also downplayed the feasibility of introducing a new Mandarin channel as he believed that a new channel would be very costly and lack time to mature before the 2010 Asian Games.&lt;ref name="nddaily10-07-06b"/&gt;

===Reactions of government officials===
[[Wang Yang (politician)|Wang Yang]], secretary of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) [[Guangdong]] Committee, noted in a session of the committee on July 16, 2010 that the important upcoming work was "education, to enlighten and culture the people with education".&lt;ref name="nddaily10-07-17"&gt;{{cite news

Meanwhile, he still encouraged local citizens to master Mandarin and use the language on formal occasions and in public places, reflecting the government's policy of promoting it.&lt;ref name="nddaily10-07-20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian10-07-25"/&gt;

===Reactions of Guangzhou TV===
In a formal response, Guangzhou TV rejected the proposal, citing "historic causes and present demands" as reasons for Cantonese-Mandarin [[bilingualism]].&lt;ref name="nddaily10-07-20"/&gt;

==Official response==

{{Death of Jesus}}
The instrument of [[crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus' crucifixion]] (known in Latin as ''[[cross|crux]]'', in Greek as ''[[stauros]]'') is generally taken to have been composed of an upright wooden beam to which was added a [[transom (architectural)|transom]], thus forming a "cruciform" or [[T]]-shaped structure.

Most [[Christian denomination]]s present the [[Christian cross]] in this form, and the tradition of the T-shape can be traced to [[early Christianity]] and the [[Church fathers]].  However, some scholars of the late 19th century have maintained that it was in reality a simple stake (''[[crux simplex]]'').

==Presence or absence of crossbar==

===Ambiguity of terms used===
The [[Koine Greek]] terms used in the [[New Testament]] of the structure on which Jesus died are ''[[stauros]]'' (σταυρός) and ''xylon'' (ξύλον). Those words, which can refer to many different things, do not indicate the precise shape of the structure. Scholars have long known that the Greek word ''stauros'' and the Latin word ''crux'' did not uniquely mean a cross. They have known too that the words had that meaning also, and so have not considered necessarily incorrect the traditional picture of a cross with transom.

The ambiguity of the terms was noted by [[Justus Lipsius]] in his ''De Cruce'' (1594),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7yVKAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Justus+Lipsius+%22de+cruce%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=otC2U8mhIPGv7AaeyoDwAw&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Justus%20Lipsius%20%22de%20cruce%22&amp;f=false Justus Lipsius, ''De Cruce'' (Ex officina Plantiniana, apud viduam &amp; Joannem Moretum, 1594)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob Gretser]] in his ''De Cruce Christi'' (1598)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3XU8AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Jacob+Gretser+De+Cruce+Christi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ecG2U5VijNvsBub1gdgM&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=simplex&amp;f=false Jacob Gretser, ''De cruce Christi, rebusque ad eam pertinentibus'' (Sartorius 1598)]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Godwyn]] in his ''Moses and Aaron'' (1662).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=li1Efx3tKSsC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=Godwyn+%22crux+simplex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-ca2U9g1kqHsBtbEgNAF&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Godwyn%20%22crux%20simplex%22&amp;f=false Thomas Godwyn, ''Moses and Aaron: Civile and Ecclesiastical Rites, Used by the Ancient Hebrews'' (S. Griffin 1662), p. 208]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Pearson (bishop)|John Pearson, Bishop of Chester]] (c. 1660) wrote in his commentary on the [[Apostles' Creed]] that the Greek word ''stauros'' originally signified "a straight standing Stake, Pale, or Palisador", but that, "when other transverse or prominent parts were added in a perfect Cross, it retained still the Original Name", and he declared: "The Form then of the Cross on which our Saviour suffered was not a simple, but a compounded, Figure, according to the Custom of the ''Romans'', by whose Procurator he was condemned to die. In which there was not only a straight and erected piece of Wood fixed in the Earth, but also a transverse Beam fastned unto that towards the top thereof".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xigOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=Pearson+stake+procurator&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hd22U_LaE5Pe7Ab3o4CABQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Pearson%20stake%20procurator&amp;f=false John Pearson, ''An Exposition of the Creed'' (London 1715, 5th edition), p. 203]&lt;/ref&gt;

Justus Lipsius invented a specific terminology to distinguish different forms of what could be called a cross or ''crux''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B7OEmYnFChkC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=simplex+compacta+invented&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=simplex%20compacta%20invented&amp;f=false Gunnar Samuelsson, ''Crucifixion in Antiquity'' (Mohr Siebeck 2013] {{ISBN|978-3-16-152508-7}}), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; His basic twofold distinction was between the ''crux simplex'' (a simple stake) and the ''crux compacta'' (a composite of two pieces of wood).&lt;ref&gt;Lipsius 1594, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The victim could be affixed to the ''crux simplex''&lt;ref&gt;Lipsius 1594, pp. 8−10&lt;/ref&gt; or could be impaled on it.&lt;ref&gt;Lipsius 1594, pp. 10−12&lt;/ref&gt; Lipsius then subdivided the ''crux compacta'' into three types: the ''crux decussata'' (X-shaped),&lt;ref&gt;Lipsius 1594, pp. 13−14&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[crux commissa]]'' (T-shaped)&lt;ref&gt;Lipsius 1594, pp. 15−17&lt;/ref&gt; and ''crux immissa'' (†-shaped).&lt;ref&gt;Lipsius 1594, pp. 17−21&lt;/ref&gt;

Lipsius himself, as also Gretser and Godwyn, held that Jesus was nailed not to a ''crux simplex'', but to a ''crux immissa''.&lt;ref&gt;Lipsius 1594, pp. 22–24; Gretser 1598,  pp. 3–7; Godwyn 1662, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[William Edwy Vine|W. E. Vine]] and [[E. W. Bullinger]], as well as Henry Dana Ward, considered that the "cross" (Greek ''stauros'', in its original sense literally an upright pale or stake) had no crossbar, and that the traditional picture of Jesus on a cross with a crossbar was incorrect.

[[File:De Cruci Libres Tres 47.jpg|thumb|right|189px|Crucifixion of Jesus, by [[Justus Lipsius]]: ''De cruce'' (1595), p. 47]]
Anglican theologian [[E. W. Bullinger]], in ''The Companion Bible'' (which was completed and published in 1922,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Bullinger+%22originally+published+in+1922%22&amp;btnG= |title=Companion Bible, p. iv |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; nine years after his 1913 death), was emphatic in his belief that ''stauros'' never meant two pieces of timber placed across one another at any angle, "but always of one piece alone ... There is nothing [of the word ''stauros''] in the Greek of the N.T. even to imply two pieces of timber." Bullinger wrote that in the [[catacombs of Rome]] Christ was never represented there as "hanging on a cross" and that the cross was a pagan symbol of life (the [[ankh]]) in Egyptian churches that was borrowed by the Christians. He cited a letter from English Dean [[John William Burgon]], who questioned whether a cross occurred on any Christian monument of the first four centuries and wrote: "The 'invention' of it in pre-Christian times, and the 'invention' of its use in later times, are truths of which we need to be reminded in the present day. The evidence is thus complete, that the Lord was put to death upon an upright stake, and not on two pieces of timber placed in any manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Bullinger+%22word+xulon%22+%22generally+denotes%22&amp;btnG= |title=E. W. Bullinger '&amp;#39;The Companion Bible'&amp;#39; Appendix 162 |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the "primary" or "original" meaning of the Greek word σταυρός, [[William Edwy Vine]] (1873–1949) wrote in his ''[[Vine's Expository Dictionary|Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words]]'', published in 1940: "''stauros'' denotes, primarily, 'an upright pale or stake'. On such malefactors were nailed for execution. Both the noun and the verb stauroo, 'to fasten to a stake or pale', are originally to be distinguished from the ecclesiastical form of a two beamed cross". He said the shape of the ecclesiastical form of a two-beamed cross "had its origin in ancient [[Chaldea]], and was used as the symbol of the god [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]] (being the shape of the mystic Tau, the initial of his name) in Chaldea and nearby lands, including [[Egypt]]". He added that third-century churches, which by then had departed from certain doctrines of the Christian faith, accepted pagans into the faith in order to increase their prestige and allowed them to retain their pagan signs and symbols. "Hence the Tau or T, in its most frequent form, with the cross-piece lowered, was adopted to stand for the 'cross' of Christ."&lt;ref&gt;[https://studybible.info/vines/Cross,%20Crucify Cross, Crucify - Vine's Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words]&lt;/ref&gt; This association of the cross symbol with Tammuz had already been made by Abram Herbert Lewis in his 1892 book ''Paganism Surviving in Christianity''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/paganismsurvivin00lewi#page/238/search/Tammuz Abram Herbert Lewis, ''Paganism Surviving in Christianity'' (G.P. Putnam's Sons 1892), p. 238]&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Stauros" interpreted as patibulum===
Andreas J. Köstenberger (2004) notes that traditional academic reconstruction of the cross has first Jesus, then Simon of Cyrene bear the "stauros," i.e. only the horizontal crossbar, Latin ''[[patibulum]]''. Yet when Simon carries the patibulum to Golgotha, the crossbar is then hoisted to the stake to make the traditional crucifix shape.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas J. Köstenberger ''John'' 2004 Page 542-  "Traditional reconstruction has Jesus bear the cross, that is, the horizontal crossbar called a patibulum, until he collapses on the way, at which time Simon of Cyrene is pressed into service (Matt. 27:32 pars.). 6."&lt;/ref&gt; Schröter (1997) notes that the lack of references in ancient sources, aside from [[Plautus]] (''The Charcoal Woman'' 2&lt;ref&gt;The Charcoal Woman ''Carbonaria'' 2 "Patibulum ferat per urbem, deinde affigatur cruci."&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''The Braggart Warrior'' 2.4.6-7&lt;ref&gt;The Braggart Warrior ''Miles gloriosus'' 2.4.6-7 "Credo ego istoc exemplo tibi esse eundum actutum extra portam, Dispessis manibus patibulum quom habebis"&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Plutarch]] (''Moralia'' 554AB&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch: “Every wrongdoer who goes to execution carries out his own cross [ekferei ton autou stauron] (Moralia 554A-B: “Concerning Things Avenged Slowly by the Deity” §9).&lt;/ref&gt;), to "bearing the cross" implies that a criminal carrying his own patibulum was not very common.&lt;ref&gt;Sverre Böe ''Cross-Bearing in Luke'' 2010 Page 72 "the criminal could be forced to carry the patibulum of the stauros from his prison, from the court or his home to the ... of references in ancient sources concerning the expression "carry the cross" implies that it was not very common." citing Jens Schröter, ''Erinnerung an Jesu Worte.

Torrance in the article "Cross" in the ''New Bible Dictionary'' writes that the Greek word for "cross" (stauros; verb stauroō; Lat. crux, crucifigo, "I fasten to a cross") means primarily an upright stake or beam, but also allows the construction that Jesus and Simon of Cyrene carried a patibulum to Golgotha.&lt;ref&gt;Knowing Christ S. Craig Glickman - 1980 "It was this patibulum, not the whole cross, which Jesus was too weak to carry, and which was borne by Simon the Cyrenian." J. B. Torrance, "Cross," New Bible Dictionary (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1962), p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ed. Wood, D. R. W., &amp; Marshall, I. H, "Cross, Crucifixion," ''New Bible Dictionary'', InterVarsity Press: Downers Grove 1996, c1982, c1962, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

In applying the word ''stauros'' to the crossbeam, these writers indicate that the complete structure on which Jesus died was not a single upright post but formed what is normally called a cross.

[[Raymond Edward Brown]] remarks that in the canonical gospels "not a word is reported about the form of the cross, about how he was affixed, about the amount of the pain",&lt;ref&gt;Raymond E. Brown, ''The Death of the Messiah'', vol. 2 (Doubleday/Chapman 1994 {{ISBN|0-225-66746-0}}), p. 945&lt;/ref&gt; but excludes the use for Jesus of a ''crux simplex'', "since he carried a cross[beam] to the place of execution".&lt;ref&gt;Raymond E. Brown, ''The Death of the Messiah'', vol. 2 (Doubleday/Chapman 1994 {{ISBN|0-225-66746-0}}), p. 948&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Stauros" interpreted as ambiguous in meaning===
''[[A Greek-English Lexicon|The Greek-English Lexicon]]'' of Liddell and Scott reports that the meaning of the word "σταυρός" in the early [[Homeric]] form of Greek, possibly of the eighth to sixth century BC, and also in the writings of the fifth-century BC writers [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]] and the early-4th century BC [[Xenophon]], is "an upright pale or stake" used to build a palisade&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3aabo%3atlg%2c0012%2c002%3a14%3a11&amp;vers=original&amp;word=stauro%2fs#word1 Odyssey 14:11] ([http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0218:book=14:card=1 translation),] [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3aabo%3atlg%2c0012%2c001%3a24%3a453&amp;vers=original&amp;word=stauro%2fs#word1 Iliad 24: 453] ([http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0217:book=24:card=440 translation),] [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3aabo%3atlg%2c0003%2c001%3a4%3a90&amp;vers=original&amp;word=stauro%2fs#word1 Peloponnesian War 4:90:2] [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0200:book=4:chapter=90:section=1 translation),] [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3aabo%3atlg%2c0032%2c006%3a5%3a2%3a21&amp;vers=original&amp;word=stauro%2fs#word1 Anabasis, 5:2:21] ([http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0202:book=5:chapter=2:section=1 translation)]&lt;/ref&gt; or "a pile driven in to serve as a foundation"&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3aabo%3atlg%2c0016%2c001%3a5%3a16&amp;vers=original&amp;word=stauro%2fs#word1 Herodotus 5:16] ([http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0126:book=5:chapter=16:section=1 translation),] [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3aabo%3atlg%2c0003%2c001%3a7%3a25&amp;vers=original&amp;word=stauro%2fs#word1 Peloponnesian War 7:25] ([http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0200:book=7:chapter=25:section=1 translation).]&lt;/ref&gt; It reports that in the writings of the first-century BC [[Diodorus Siculus]], first-century AD [[Plutarch]] and early second-century [[Lucian]]—as well as in {{bibleverse||Matthew|27:40}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|9:23}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|14:27}}—the word "σταυρός" is used to refer to a cross, either as the instrument of crucifixion or metaphorically of voluntary suffering; "its form was indicated by the [[Tau|Greek letter T]]".

"----------" "but will you nail him to a cross or impale him on a stake ...An vitiositas ad infelicitatem sufficiat 499E "&lt;/ref&gt;

Joel B. Green, in ''The Cambridge Companion to Jesus'', says the evidence of the manner of Jesus' death is far more ambiguous than is generally realised. Literary sensibilities in Roman antiquity did not promote graphic descriptions of the act of crucifixion, and even the Gospels report simply, "They crucified him," adding no further detail. According to Green, the Romans were slaves to no standard technique of crucifixion: "In describing the siege of Jerusalem by the Roman army, for example, Josephus reports that ‘the soldiers out of rage and hatred amused themselves by nailing their prisoners in different positions’ (J.W. 5.449–51). Elsewhere we learn that victims of crucifixion might be fixed to the stake in order to die, or impaled after death as a public display. They might be fixed to the cross with nails or with ropes. That Jesus was nailed to the cross is intimated in several texts (John 20.25; Acts 2.23; Col 2.14; Gos. Pet. 6.21; Justin Dial. 97). Nor can we turn to archaeological evidence for assistance."&lt;ref&gt;Joel B. Green, ''The Cambridge Companion to Jesus'', Cambridge University Press, 2001, pg. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Robin M. Jensen, in her book entitled ''The Cross: History, Art, and Controversy,'' says that ‘''stauros'' (Latin = ''crux'') did not necessarily imply [a cross]. Historically both Greek and Latin words simply referred to an upright stake to which those condemned to death might be bound or tied until they suffocated to death. The conventional picture of a Latin cross (''crux immissa'') has been challenged over the centuries as some scholars and even Christian communities have argued instead that Christ died on a T-shaped cross (''crux comissa'') or even upon a simple stake (''crux simplex'').’&lt;ref&gt;Robin M. Jensen, ''The Cross: History, Art, and Controversy,'' Harvard University Press, 2017, p. 9. {{ISBN|9780674088801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Stauros" interpreted as a cross in the case of Jesus===

In his book ''Crucifixion in Antiquity'', Gunnar Samuelsson declares that, while the New Testament terminology is in itself not conclusive one way or another for the meaning of the word, "[t]here is a good possibility that σταυρός, when used by the evangelists, already had been charged with a distinct denotation − from Calvary. When, e.g., Mark used the noun it could have meant 'cross' in the sense in which the Church later perceived it. [...] The Gospel accounts probably show that σταυρός ''could'' signify "cross" in the mentioned sense, but they do not show that it always did so."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://khazarzar.skeptik.net/books/crux002.pdf |title=Crucifixion in Antiquity |author=Gunnar Samuelsson |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |date=2011 |pages=259−260|accessdate=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his Q and A page he adds: "(The Gospels) do not describe the event in length [...] The non-detailed accounts of the Gospels do not, however, contradict the traditional understanding. So the traditional understanding of the death of Jesus is correct, but we could acknowledge that it is more based on the eyewitness accounts than the actual passion narratives."&lt;ref name=Samuelson&gt;[http://www.exegetics.org/Q_and_A.html Gunnar Samuelson's website devoted to the book, ''Crucifixion in Antiquity''|retrieved November 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology'', dealing specifically with the crucifixion of Jesus, says it is most likely that the ''stauros'' had a transverse in the form of a crossbeam. "Secular sources do not permit any conclusion to be drawn as to the precise form of the cross, as to whether it was the ''crux immissa'' (&lt;span style="font-size:125%;"&gt;†&lt;/span&gt;) or ''crux commissa'' (T). As it was not very common to affix a ''titlos'' (superscription, loanword from the Lat. ''titulus''), it does not necessarily follow that the cross had the form of a ''crux immissa''."

The authors say there were two possible ways of erecting the ''stauros'', which would probably have been not much higher than the height of a man. The condemned man could be fastened to the cross lying on the ground at the place of execution, then lifted up on it. Alternatively, it was probably usual to have the stake implanted in the ground before the execution. The victim was tied to the crosspiece and was hoisted up with the horizontal beam and made fast to the vertical stake. They say that as this was the simpler form of erection, and the carrying of the crossbeam (''patibulum'') was probably a form of punishment for slaves, the ''crux commissa'' may be taken as the normal practice.&lt;ref&gt;The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology, p. 392 ([http://www.bible.ca/d-history-archeology-crucifixion-cross.htm quoted here])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other technical details==

===Foundation in the ground===
The question of the nature of the foundation for the cross used to crucify Jesus, is related to whether Jesus carried only the patibulum or the full cross (patibulum and stipes) to Golgotha - as to whether the upright stipes was a permanent fixture on Golgotha, or whether there was a permanent, or specially prepared reinforced hole for the base of the stipes.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Raaf. (2010). ''Conspiracy with Malicious Intent'': "On the north and western side of the Jerusalem, the condemned made their way to Golgotha, known as the Place of the Skull ... was raised into position so it could be dropped into the hole in the ground which had been dug the day before." (p. 396)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Cassanelli. ''The Holy Shroud'': "At the time of the execution, the cross was prepared by fixing the vertical shaft or 'stipes' in the ground and making the condemned prisoner carry the horizontal." (p. 29)&lt;/ref&gt; This also relates to the height of the cross, where estimates vary from {{convert|8|ft|m}}&lt;ref&gt;M. D. Geoffrey L. Phelan. (2009). ''Crucifixion and the Death Cry of Jesus Christ'': "When the victim reached the crucifixion grounds, an upright stake was usually already in the ground. This stake was called stipes by the Romans. The usual height of the stipes was six to eight feet." (p. 35)&lt;/ref&gt; to {{convert|15|ft|m}} in height.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery Donley. (2006). ''The Everything History of the Bible Book'': "The cross was in two pieces, the long (stipes) piece was about fifteen feet in height and the small crossbeam (pantibulum) ... " (p. 138)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Method of fastening victim===
{{expand section|date=March 2012}}
Some theories suggest 3 nails were used to fasten victims while others suggest 4 nails.&lt;ref&gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1988 {{ISBN|0-8028-3785-9}} page 826&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout history, larger numbers of nails have been hypothesized, at times as high as 14 nails.&lt;ref name=Kitto &gt;''Encyclopedia of Biblical Literature, Part 2'' by John Kitto 2003 {{ISBN|0-7661-5980-9}} page 591&lt;/ref&gt; The placing of the nails in the hands, or the wrists is also uncertain.&lt;ref name=Ball82 &gt;''The Crucifixion and Death of a Man Called Jesus'' by David A Ball 2010 {{ISBN|1-61507-128-8}} pages 82-84&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory suggests that the Greek word  for hand also includes the forearm and that the nails were placed near the [[Radius (bone)|radius]] and [[ulna]] of the [[forearm]].&lt;ref name=Moore639 &gt;''The Chronological Life of Christ'' by Mark E. Moore 2007 {{ISBN|0-89900-955-7}} page 639-643&lt;/ref&gt; Ropes may have also been used to fasten the hands in addition to the use of nails.&lt;ref&gt;''Holman Concise Bible Dictionary'' Holman, 2011 {{ISBN|0-8054-9548-7}} page 148&lt;/ref&gt;

===Footrest===
Another issue has been the use of a ''hypopodium'' as a standing platform to support the feet, given that the hands may not have been able to support the weight.&lt;ref name=Kitto /&gt; In the 20th century, forensic pathologist [[Frederick Zugibe]] performed a number of crucifixion experiments by using ropes to hang human subjects at various angles and hand positions.&lt;ref name=Moore639 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Crucifixion and the Death Cry of Jesus Christ'' by Geoffrey L Phelan MD, 2009 ISBN pages 106-111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
{{further information|Cross#Name}}

===Greek ''xylon'' ("timber, tree")===
In the Hebrew Bible Deuteronomy 21:23 states that "cursed of God is everyone who hangs on a tree". In the Septuagint this became ἐπὶ ξύλου (''epi xylou''). The word ξύλον (''xylon'') can mean anything made of wood, even something as complex as the [[Trojan horse]],&lt;ref name=L&amp;S&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=cu/lon1 Liddell&amp;Scott, ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]'': ξύλον]&lt;/ref&gt; and applies also to a tree, even a living one, such as that described in the [[Book of Revelation]] 22:2 as the tree of life bearing fruit every month and whose leaves serve for healing. This word is used in the New Testament to refer to that on which Jesus died: Peter's 3 uses of ''xylon'' (in English Bibles "tree") compared to Paul who only uses ''xylon'' "piece of wood" once.&lt;ref&gt;1 Peter: a new translation with introduction and commentary: Volume 37, Part 2 John Hall Elliott - 2000 "... the light of this Deuteronomic passage ("cursed of Cod is everyone who hangs on a tree [epi xylon])," Deut 21:23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Acts of the Apostles - Page 98 Luke Timothy Johnson, Daniel J. Harrington - 1992 ".. which derives from the LXX usage for "hanging" (Josh 8:29; 10:24), and above all from the curse passage of Deut 21:23"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1 Peter: a new translation with introduction and commentary John Hall Elliott - 2000 "The use of "tree" also distinguishes 1 Peter from Paul who, apart from Gal 3:13, employs stauros, never xylon, for the cross of Christ (cf. 1 Cor 1:17, 18; Gal 5:1 1; 6:12, 14; Phil 2:8; 3:18). By contrast, the Petrine author employs ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1 and 2 Peter, Jude Norman Hillyer - 2011 "Peter's description of the cross of Christ as a tree (xylon) is a favorite expression of his, for it recurs in his addresses in Acts (5:30; 10:39). According to Deuteronomy 21:22–23LXX, one who broke the Mosaic law was to be hanged on a tree"&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greek texts the word ''xylon'' could be used for any object made of wood, including in varying contexts, gallows, stocks, pales and stakes. Therefore, the traditional Christian cross with a horizontal crossbeam would also be called ''xylon''. In Liddell and Scott, the meanings of the word "ξύλον" are classified under five headings: :I. wood cut and ready for use, firewood, timber (in these senses the word is usually in the plural); :II. piece of wood, log, beam, post or an object made of wood, such as a spoon, the Trojan horse, a cudgel or club, an instrument of punishment (a collar for someone's neck, stocks to confine his feet or to confine his neck, arms and legs, a gallows to hang him, or a stake to [[impalement|impale]] him), a table, a bench as in the theatre; :III. a tree :IV. a blockhead or a stubborn person; :V. a measure of length.&lt;ref name=L&amp;S/&gt;

===English===
In English also, the words "tree" and "timber" are applied to Christ's cross envisaged as with transom: a hymn sung at the [[Good Friday]] veneration of the cross has the refrain: "Faithful ''Cross'' the Saints rely on, Noble ''tree'' beyond compare! [...] Sweet the ''timber'', sweet the iron, Sweet the burden that they bear!"&lt;ref&gt;[[Roman Missal]], Friday of Holy Week&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncpd.org/sites/default/files/Roman%20Missal%207%20Proper%20of%20Time%20----------Size%2024.pdf Roman Missal, Proper of Time] pp. 692-697&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology used by ancient writers===

Apart from meaning a stake, the word ''stauros'' was also used by writers of the early Christian period to refer to a construction with transom.

Using the Greek word σταυρός in its verbal form, the Jewish historian [[Josephus]] too, writing of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|siege of Jerusalem]] in AD 70, recounted that the Jews caught outside the city walls "were first whipped, and then tormented with all sorts of tortures, before they died, and were then crucified before the wall of the city … the soldiers, out of the wrath and hatred they bore the Jews, nailed those they caught, ''one after one way, and another after another'', to the crosses, by way of jest."&lt;ref&gt;προβασανιζόμενοι τοῦ θανάτου πᾶσαν αἰκίαν ἀνεσταυρούντο του τείχους αντικρύ [...] προσήλουν δὲ οἱ στρατιῶται δι' ὀργήν καὶ μίσος τοὺς ἁλόντας ἄλλον ἄλλῳ σχήματι πρὸς χλεύην ([http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/war-5.htm The War of the Jews], 5:11 [449-451])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], who lived at the time of the birth of Jesus, described how those condemned to crucifixion were led to the place of execution:
{{quotation|"A Roman citizen of no obscure station, having ordered one of his slaves to be put to death, delivered him to his fellow-slaves to be led away, and in order that his punishment might be witnessed by all, directed them to drag him through the Forum and every other conspicuous part of the city as they whipped him, and that he should go ahead of the procession which the Romans were at that time conducting in honour of the god. The men ordered to lead the slave to his punishment, having stretched out both his arms and fastened them to ''a piece of wood'' which extended across his breast and shoulders as far as his wrists, followed him, tearing his naked body with whips."&lt;ref&gt;Ρωμαῖος οὐκ ἀφανής θεράποντα ἴδιον ἐπὶ τιμωρίᾳ θανάτου παραδοὺς τοῖς ὁμοδούλοις ἄγειν, ἵνα δὴ περιφανὴς ἡ τιμωρία τοῦ ἀνθρώπου γένηται, δι' ἀγορᾶς αὐτὸν ἐκέλευσε μαστιγούμενον ἕλκειν καὶ εἴ τις ἄλλος ἦν τῆς πόλεως τόπος ἐπιφανής ἡγούμενον τῆς πομπῆς, ἣν ἔστελλε τῷ θεῷ κατ' ἐκεῖνον τὸν καιρὸν ἡ πόλις. Οἱ δ' ἄγοντες τὸν θεράποντα ἐπὶ τὴν τιμωρίαν τὰς χεῖρας ἀποτείναντες ἀμφοτέρας καὶ ξύλῳ προσδήσαντες παρὰ τὰ στέρνα τε καὶ τοὺς ὤμους καὶ μέχρι τῶν καρπῶν διήκοντι παρηκολούθουν ξαίνοντες μάστιξι γυμνὸν ὄντα.

Dionysius here uses the Greek word ''xylon'' (ξύλον) for the horizontal crossbeam (the "patibulum") used in Roman crucifixions; he describes how the hands of the condemned man were tied to it (''χεῖρας ἀποτείναντες ἀμφοτέρας [...] προσδήσαντες'') for him to be whipped while being led to the place of execution.&lt;ref&gt;Since Greek did not have a specific word for what in Latin was called the patibulum, it seems possible that the crossbeam is what is meant by the word "σταυρός" applied in {{bibleverse||Matthew||27:32}}, {{bibleverse||Mark||15:21}}, {{bibleverse||Luke||23:26}} and {{bibleverse||John||19:17}} to what Jesus himself or [[Simon of Cyrene]] carried to his place of execution. "If we can accept the certainty of Jesus' crucifixion as an historical datum, what can we say about the manner of his death? ... In spite of the paucity and ambiguity of the evidence, [[Martin Hengel]] suggests a summary sketch of the Roman procedure of crucifixion. Crucifixion included a flogging beforehand, with victims generally made to carry their own crossbeams to the location of their execution, where they were bound or nailed to the cross with arms extended, raised up, and, perhaps seated on a small wooden peg (Hengel 1977: 22–32)" (Markus Bockmuehl, The Cambridge Companion to Jesus. Cambridge University Press, 2001, pages 90-91).&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid-2nd-century diviner [[Artemidorus]] spoke of crucifixion as something that occurred on a cross that had breadth as well as height: "Since he is a criminal, he will be crucified ''in his height and in the extension of his hands''" (Oneirocritica 1:76).&lt;ref&gt;"κακούργος δὲ ὦν σταυρωθήσεται διὰ τὸ ὕψος καὶ τὴν τῶν χειρῶν ἔκτασιν" (Oneirocritica 1:76)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucian]] of Samosata (121-180) describes the crucifixion of the mythical [[Prometheus]] by nailing him to a precipice on the [[Caucasus]] "with his hands outstretched (ἐκπετασθεὶς τὼ χεῖρε) from crag to crag."&lt;ref&gt;"ἐκπετασθεὶς τὼ χεῖρε ἀπὸ τούτου τοῦ κρημνοῦ πρὸς τὸν ἐναντίον" ([http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl1/wl112.htm Prometheus on Caucasus, 1-2])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Christian descriptions==
{{Main article|Early Christian descriptions of the execution cross}}
Although there is discussion about the meaning or meanings that the words σταυρός and ''crux'' had at that time, and about the shape or shapes that such gibbets had, Christians of the first centuries are unanimous in describing the particular structure on which Jesus died as having a transom, not as a simple upright.

The pseudepigraphic [[Epistle of Barnabas]], which scholars suggest may have been before the end of the 1st century,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Dominic Crossan]], The Cross that Spoke, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; and certainly earlier than 135,&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the date of the work, see [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/barnabas.html Information on Epistle of Barnabas] and Andrew C. Clark, "Apostleship: Evidence from the New Testament and Early Christian Literature," ''Evangelical Review of Theology,'' 1989, Vol. 13, p. 380&lt;/ref&gt; whether the writer was an orthodox Christian or not, described the shape people at the time attributed to the device on which Jesus died: the comparisons it draws with Old Testament figures would have had no validity for its readers if they pictured Jesus as dying on a simple stake. Referring to what he saw as Old Testament intimations of Jesus and his cross, he likened the cross to the letter T (the Greek letter tau, which had the [[Greek numerals|numeric]] value of 300),&lt;ref name=Barnabas&gt;[[s:Epistle of Barnabas#Chapter 9|Epistle of Barnabas, 9:7-8]]&lt;/ref&gt; thus describing it as having a crossbeam. He also wrote, with regard to {{bibleverse||Exodus|17:11-12|KJV}}: "The Spirit saith to the heart of Moses, that he should ''make a type of the cross and of Him that was to suffer'', that unless, saith He, they shall set their hope on Him, war shall be waged against them for ever. Moses therefore pileth arms one upon another in the midst of the encounter, and standing on higher ground than any ''he stretched out his hands'', and so Israel was again victorious."&lt;ref name=Barnabas/&gt;

[[Celsus]] (as quoted by [[Origen]] Contra Celsum, II:36) &lt;ref&gt;Εἶτα φησὶν ὁ Κέλσος: Τί φησὶ καὶ ἀνασκολοπιζομένου τοῦ σώματος; ([http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04162.htm ''Contra Celsum, II:36])&lt;/ref&gt; and Origen himself&lt;ref name=III32/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mercure.fltr.ucl.ac.be/Hodoi/concordances/origene_contre_celse_03/ligne05.cfm?numligne=33&amp;mot=6857 ''Contra Celsum, III, 32]&lt;/ref&gt; uses the verb "ἀνασκολοπίζω", which originally meant "to impale", of the crucifixion of Jesus. It was considered synonymous&lt;ref name=III32&gt;"καὶ "Κράξας φωνῇ μεγάλῃ ἀφῆκε τὸ πνεῦμα", προλαβὼν τοὺς ἐπὶ τῶν ''ἀνασκολοπιζομένων'' δήμιους, ὑποτέμνοντας τὰ σκέλη τῶν ''σταυρουμένων''" ([http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04163.htm ''Contra Celsum, III, 32]).&lt;/ref&gt; with "σταυρῶ", which also seems to have originally meant "to impale", and was applied also to the gibbet of Jesus' execution; but the shape of the gibbet is compared by Origen to that of the letter '''Τ'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Selecta in Ezechiel'', 9:4; cf. [https://books.google.com/books?id=wRIUBKoyOzEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA114&amp;lpg=RA1-PA114&amp;dq=origen+ezekiel+9&amp;source=web&amp;ots=LuddOfs8X_&amp;sig=Gk-abWec1bf1Vo3jR5Vk6133GbQ Arche: A Collection of Patristic Studies By Jacobus Cornelis Maria van Winden]&lt;/ref&gt; The final words of the ''Trials in the Court of Vowels'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl1/wl110.htm&lt;/ref&gt;''Δίκη Φωνηέντων'', 12.4-13 found among the works of [[Lucian]], also identify the shape of the σταυρός with that of the letter '''Τ'''. And, as already mentioned, in '' Prometheus on Caucasus'' Lucian describes Prometheus as crucified "with his hands outstretched".

The 2nd-century [[Odes of Solomon]], probably by a heterodox Christian, includes the following: "I extended my hands and hallowed my Lord, /For the expansion of my hands is His sign. /And my extension is the upright cross (σταυρός)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9qc2DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=%22%22I+extended+my+hands+and+hallowed+my+Lord%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=efJNlfTNzF&amp;sig=9WseUqJCg6s8ql4dFQAGWstuMLg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjClZfoxb7XAhUIJMAKHeNFA7AQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%22I%20extended%20my%20hands%20and%20hallowed%20my%20Lord%22&amp;f=false |title=Justification in the Second Century |publisher=Walter de Gruyter  |date=2017 |accessdate=2017-11-14 |author=Brian J.

[[Justin Martyr]] (100–165) explicitly says the cross of Christ was of two-beam shape: "That lamb which was commanded to be wholly roasted was a symbol of the suffering of the cross which Christ would undergo. For the lamb, which is roasted, is roasted and dressed up in the form of the cross. For one spit is transfixed right through from the lower parts up to the head, and one across the back, to which are attached the legs of the lamb."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.xl.html |title=Dialogue with Trypho, chapter XL |publisher=Ccel.org |date=2005-07-13 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the Epistle of Barnabas, Justin saw the stretched-out hands of Moses in the battle against Amalek as foreshadowing the cross of Jesus: "If he gave up any part of this sign, which was an imitation of the cross (σταυρός), the people were beaten, as is recorded in the writings of Moses; but if he remained in this form, Amalek was proportionally defeated, and he who prevailed prevailed by the cross (σταυρός). For it was not because Moses so prayed that the people were stronger, but because, while one who bore the name of Jesus (Joshua) was in the forefront of the battle, he himself made the sign of the cross (σταυρός)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-dialoguetrypho.html |title=Dialogue with Tryphon, 90:4 |publisher=Earlychristianwritings.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Justus Lipsius De cruce istio.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Drawing in [[Justus Lipsius]], ''De cruce''. Justin Martyr: "that trophy which is called a sail abide safe in the ship"]]

In his [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.ii.lv.html First Apology, 55] Justin refers to various objects as shaped like the cross of Christ: "The sea is not traversed except that trophy which is called a sail abide safe in the ship … And the human form differs from that of the irrational animals in nothing else than in its being erect and having the hands extended, and having on the face extending from the forehead what is called the nose, through which there is respiration for the living creature; and this shows no other form than that of the cross (σταυρός)."
[[Image:Justus Lipsius De cruce man.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Drawing in [[Justus Lipsius]], ''De cruce''. Justin Martyr: "…being erect and having the hands extended…shows no other form than that of the cross"]]

The apocryphal [[Acts of Peter]], of the second half of the 2nd century, attaches symbolic significance to the upright and the crossbeam of the cross of Jesus: "What else is Christ, but the word, the sound of God? So that the word is the upright beam (''to orthon xulon''&lt;ref&gt;Gerardus Q. Reijners ''The terminology of the Holy Cross in early Christian literature'' 1965 "And the Sound is that which crosseth it (to plagion), the nature of man'.1 Here too the Cross is a symbol of Christ : the upright beam represents the Word, the transverse beam human nature.2&lt;/ref&gt;) whereon I am crucified. And the sound is that which crosseth it (''to plagion''), the nature of man. And the nail which holdeth the cross-tree unto the upright in the midst thereof is the conversion and repentance of man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/actspeter.html |title=Acts of Peter, 38 |publisher=Earlychristianwritings.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Irenaeus]], who died around the end of the 2nd century, speaks of the cross as having "five extremities, two in length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on which [last] the person rests who is fixed by the nails."&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus Haereses]]'', [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103224.htm II, xxiv, 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hippolytus of Rome]] (170 – 235 AD), writing about the blessing Jacob obtained from his father Isaac ({{bibleverse||Genesis|27:1-29}}), said: "The skins which were put upon his arms are the sins of both peoples, which Christ, when ''His hands were stretched forth on the cross'', fastened to it along with Himself."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0502.htm Hippolytus as quoted in [[Jerome]]'s, Epist. 36, Ad Damasum, Num. XVIII]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:De Cruci Libres Tres ship.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Justus Lipsius]], ''De cruce''. Minucius Felix: "ships…with swelling sails…with expanded oars"]]

[[Image:Justus Lipsius yoke.jpg|thumb|50px|left|[[Justus Lipsius]], ''De cruce'': military standard (cf. Minucius Felix)]]
In his Octavius, [[Marcus Minucius Felix]] (? — c. 250AD, Rome), responding to the pagan jibe that Christians ''worship'' wooden crosses – an indication of how the cross symbol was already associated with Christians – denies the charge and then retorts that the cross shape (a crossbeam placed on an upright) is honoured even by pagans in the form of their standards and trophies and is in any case found in nature: "Crosses, moreover, we neither worship nor wish for. You, indeed, who consecrate gods of wood, adore wooden crosses perhaps as parts of your gods. For your very standards,&lt;ref&gt;"The cross as it appears on the sarcophagi has often a close likeness to the standards which were carried before the Roman armies, on which the transverse bar supported the banner bearing the images of the reigning emperors, the ''sacri vultus''. Thus the standards had the form of the letter tau (T), which was in fact the most realistic form of the cross, as Tertullian (Apol. 16) and Justin Martyr remark" (Walter Lowrie, ''Art in the Early Church''. Pantheon Books, 1947, p. 98).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as your banners; and flags of your camp, what else are they but crosses gilded and adorned? Your victorious trophies not only imitate the appearance of a simple cross, but also that of a man affixed to it. We assuredly see the sign of a cross, naturally, in the ship when it is carried along with swelling sails, when it glides forward with expanded oars; and when the military yoke is lifted up, it is the sign of a cross; and when a man adores God with a pure mind, with hands outstretched. Thus the sign of the cross either is sustained by a natural reason, or your own religion is formed with respect to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/octavius.html |title=Octavius, 29 |publisher=Earlychristianwritings.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In language very similar to that of Minucius Felix, [[Tertullian]], too, who distinguished between ''stipes'' (stake) and ''crux'' (cross),&lt;ref&gt;He wrote, for instance, in [http://www.grtbooks.com/exitfram.asp?idx=3&amp;yr=200&amp;aa=AA&amp;at=AA&amp;ref=tertullian&amp;URL=http://www.tertullian.org/latin/apologeticus.htm ''Apology'', chapter 12], "Crucibus et stipitibus inponitis Christianos" (You put Christians on crosses and stakes)&lt;/ref&gt; noted that it was the cross that people associated with Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.iv.iii.xvi.html |title='&amp;#39;Apology'&amp;#39;, 16 |publisher=Ccel.org |date=2005-06-01 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; And he indicated that the shape of the cross is that of the letter T: "The Greek letter Tau and our own letter T is the very form of the cross, which (God) predicted would be the sign on our foreheads",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/03123.htm |title=Against Marcion, Book III, 22 |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compared it to the shape of a bird with outstretched wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alexander Souter |url=http://www.tertullian.org/articles/souter_orat_bapt/souter_orat_bapt_03prayer.htm |title=On Prayer, chapter 29 |publisher=Tertullian.org |date=2002-12-16 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-Christian arguments thus cited in the [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-04/anf04-34.htm ''Octavius''] of Minucius Felix, chapters IX and XXIX, and Tertullian's ''Apology'', 16 show that the cross symbol was already associated with Christians in the 2nd century. Tertullian could designate the body of Christian believers as ''crucis religiosi'', ''i.e.'' "devotees of the Cross".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0301.htm |title='&amp;#39;Apology'&amp;#39;., chapter xvi |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''De Corona'', written in 204, Tertullian tells how it was already a tradition for Christians to trace repeatedly on their foreheads the sign of the cross.&lt;ref&gt;"At every forward step and movement, at every going in and out, when we put on our clothes and shoes, when we bathe, when we sit at table, when we light the lamps, on couch, on seat, in all the ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the sign" ([http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.iv.vi.iii.html ''De Corona'', chapter 3])&lt;/ref&gt;

So closely associated with Christ was the cross that [[Clement of Alexandria]], who died between 211 and 216, could without fear of ambiguity use the phrase ''τὸ κυριακὸν σημεῖον'' (the Lord's sign) to mean the cross, when he repeated the idea, current as early as the Epistle of Barnabas, that the number 318 (in [[Greek numerals]], ΤΙΗ) in {{bibleverse||Genesis|14:14}} was a foreshadowing (a "type") of the cross (T, an upright with crossbar, standing for 300) and of Jesus (ΙΗ, the first two letter of his name ΙΗΣΟΥΣ, standing for 18).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/clement-stromata-book6.html |title=Stromata, book VI, chapter XI |publisher=Earlychristianwritings.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For other 2nd-century instances of the use of the cross, in its familiar form, as a Christian symbol, see the references in the [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=899&amp;letter=C Jewish Encyclopedia article on the cross:]
:The cross as a Christian symbol or "seal" came into use at least as early as the 2nd century (see "Apost. Const." iii. 17; Epistle of Barnabas, xi.-xii.; Justin, "Apologia," i. 55-60; "Dial. cum Tryph." 85-97); and the marking of a cross upon the forehead and the chest was regarded as a talisman against the powers of demons (Tertullian, "De Corona," iii.; Cyprian, "Testimonies," xi. 21-22; Lactantius, "Divinæ Institutiones," iv. 27, and elsewhere). Accordingly, the Christian Fathers had to defend themselves, as early as the 2nd century, against the charge of being worshipers of the cross, as may be learned from Tertullian, "Apologia," xii., xvii., and Minucius Felix, "Octavius," xxix. Christians used to swear by the power of the cross (see Apocalypse of Mary, viii., in James, "Texts and Studies,"  iii. 118).

==Archaeology==

The [[Alexamenos graffito]], which was once thought to be the earliest surviving pictorial representation of a crucifixion and has been interpreted as mockery of a Christian, shows a cross as an instrument of execution. Its date is uncertain: some have posited for it a date as early as 85, but it may be as late as the 3rd century, and even thus prior to AD 300.

What now appears to be the most ancient surviving image of a Roman crucifixion is a graffito found in a taberna (an inn for wayfarers) in Puteoli, dating from the time of [[Trajan]] (98–117) or [[Hadrian]] (117–138). The cross has the T shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=John Granger|title=Crucifixion as Spectacle in Roman Campania|journal=Novum Testamentum|year=2012|volume=54|issue=1|pages=60–100, esp. 92–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann "Jack" Unterweger''' (16 August 1950{{spaced ndash}}29 June 1994) was an [[Austria]]n [[serial killer]] who committed [[murder]] in several countries. First convicted of a 1974 murder, he was released in 1990 as an example of [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]]. He became a journalist and minor celebrity, but within months started killing again. After being convicted of an additional nine murders, he committed [[suicide]] by hanging himself in prison.

== Early life ==
Unterweger was born in 1950 to Theresia Unterweger, a Viennese barmaid and waitress, and an unknown [[United States|American]] soldier whom she met in [[Trieste]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=EnteringHades/&gt;  Some sources describe his mother as a prostitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Genetic Suspects: Global Governance of Forensic DNA Profiling and Databasing |publisher=Cambridge University Press |author=Hindmarsh, Richard |year=2010 |isbn=9780521519434 |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was jailed for fraud while pregnant but was released and travelled to [[Graz]], where he was born. After his mother was arrested again in 1953, Unterweger was sent to [[Carinthia]] to live with his grandfather and his wife.&lt;ref name=EnteringHades/&gt;

Unterweger was in and out of [[prison]] during his youth for petty crimes, and for [[assault]]ing a local prostitute. Between 1966 and 1975 he was convicted sixteen times, mostly for [[sexual assault]]; he spent most of those nine years in jail.&lt;ref name="crime"&gt;{{cite book |title=Crime: Computer Viruses to Twin Towers |publisher=Universal-Publishers |author=Milhorn, Thomas H. |year=2004 |pages=464 |isbn=9781581124897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First murder conviction, imprisonment, and release==
In 1974, Unterweger murdered 18-year-old [[Germany|German]] citizen Margaret Schäfer by [[strangulation|strangling]] her with her own [[Brassiere|bra]], and in 1976 he was arrested and sentenced to life in prison. While in prison, Unterweger wrote [[short stories]], [[poem]]s, [[Play (theatre)|plays]], and an [[autobiography]], ''Purgatory or The Trip to Prison – Report of a Guilty Man'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/murderers-final-freedom-the-bizarre-life-of-jack-unterweger-poet-and-killer-of-prostitutes-ends-at-1417861.html|title=Murderer's 'final freedom': The bizarre life of Jack Unterweger, poet|date=1994-07-03|newspaper=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; that later served as the basis for a documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/locarno-film-review-jack-1201569201/|title=Locarno Film Review: 'Jack'|last=Debruge|first=Peter|date=2015-08-13|newspaper=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, a campaign to pardon and release Unterweger from prison began. Austrian President [[Rudolf Kirchschläger]] refused the petition when presented to him, citing the court-mandated minimum of fifteen years in prison.&lt;ref name=EnteringHades/&gt; Writers, artists, journalists and politicians{{snd}} mostly Socialists{{snd}} agitated for a pardon,&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/books/review/Macfarlane-t.html|publisher=New York Times|author=Robert MacFarlane|title=A Murderous Talent|date=13 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the author and 2004 [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Elfriede Jelinek]], [[Günter Grass]],&lt;ref name="vienna"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/30/malkovich-jack-unterweger-vienna-austria|title=John Malkovich brings serial killer Jack Unterweger back to life on Vienna stage|author=Kate Connolly|date=30 June 2009|publisher=''The Guardian''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Huemer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oe1.orf.at/artikel/213918|publisher=Österreichischer Rundfunk, ORF, ("Austrian Broadcasting") |author=Gerhard Moser|title=Der Mann aus dem Fegefeuer (The man from purgatory) |date=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the editor of the magazine [[Austrian literature#21st century|''Manuskripte'']], Alfred Kolleritsch.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Unterweger was released on 23 May 1990, after the required minimum fifteen years of his life term. Upon his release, his autobiography was taught in schools and his stories for children were performed on the radio. Unterweger himself hosted television programs which discussed criminal rehabilitation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ypfCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT243&amp;ots=fmTNU2o3Ly&amp;dq=unterweger%20taught%20in%20schools&amp;pg=PT243#v=onepage&amp;q=unterweger%20taught%20in%20schools&amp;f=false|title=When Things Seem Odd: Polly and the Internal Guardian|last=Legare|first=Michael Joseph|date=2016-01-13|publisher=FriesenPress|isbn=9781460277539|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked as a reporter for the public broadcaster [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]], where he reported on stories concerning the very murders for which he was later found guilty.&lt;ref name=vienna/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

== Later murders ==
Law enforcement later found that Unterweger killed a sex worker named Blanka Bockova in Czechoslovakia,&lt;ref name="atkinson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://praha.idnes.cz/vyroci-vrazdy-v-praze-pred-25-lety-dqq-/praha-zpravy.aspx?c=A150915_2191839_praha-zpravy_bur Czech language article about the victim from Prague]&lt;/ref&gt; and seven more in Austria in 1990 (Brunhilde Masser, 39; Heidi Hammerer, 31; Elfriede Schrempf, 35; Silvia Zagler, 23; Sabine Moitzl, 25; Karin Eroglu-Sladky, 25; Regina Prem, 32) in the first year after his release, all garroted with their bras.&lt;ref name="atkinson"/&gt; In 1991, Unterweger was hired by an Austrian magazine to write about crime in [[Los Angeles, California]], and the differences between [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Europe]]an attitudes to prostitution. Unterweger met with local police, even going so far as to participate in a [[ride-along]] of the city's [[red light district]]s.&lt;ref name="atkinson"/&gt; During Unterweger's time in Los Angeles, three sex workers{{snd}} Shannon Exley, Irene Rodriguez, and Peggy Booth{{snd}} were beaten, [[rape|sexually assaulted]] with tree branches, and strangled with their own brassieres.&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-06-30/local/me-10223_1_los-angeles|title=Austrian Slayer of L.A. Prostitutes Kills Self|last=Malnic|first=Eric|date=June 30, 1994|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Austria, Unterweger was suggested as a suspect for the sex worker murders. In the absence of other suspects, the police took a serious look at Unterweger and kept him under [[surveillance]] until he went to the U.S.{{snd}} ostensibly as a [[journalism|reporter]]{{snd}} observing nothing to connect him with the murders.

== Arrest and death ==
Police in Graz eventually had enough evidence to issue a warrant for his arrest, but Unterweger had left by the time they entered his home.&lt;ref name="atkinson"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Atkinson |first1=Rick |title=Killer Prose |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1994/08/03/killer-prose/796b8f84-0ee1-437e-9cd6-6496cbecbbe6/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.b04f20f84984 |accessdate=6 August 2018 |work=The Washington Post |date=3 August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; After law enforcement agencies chased him and his girlfriend, Bianca Mrak, through Switzerland, France, and the United States, he was finally arrested by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] in Miami, Florida, on 27 February 1992.&lt;ref name="atkinson"/&gt; While a fugitive, he had called the Austrian media to try to convince them of his innocence. He was extradited to Austria on 27 May 1992, and charged with 11 homicides, including one which had occurred in Prague and three in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="atkinson"/&gt; The jury found him guilty of nine murders by a 6:2 majority (sufficient for a conviction under Austrian law at the time).&lt;ref name="atkinson"/&gt; On 29 June 1994, Unterweger was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.

That night, he committed suicide at [[Graz-Karlau Prison]] by hanging himself with a rope made from shoelaces and a cord from the trousers of a track suit, using the same knot that was found on all the strangled prostitutes.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;&lt;ref name="atkinson"/&gt;

Based on psychiatric examination, Austrian psychiatrist Dr. Reinhard Haller diagnosed him with [[narcissistic personality disorder]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Haller |first1=Reinhard |title=Malignant Narcissism and Sexual Homicide - exemplified by the Jack Unterweger case |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/%5BMalignant-narcissism-and-sexual-by-the-Jack-case%5D.-Haller/2e333eac26086d3a565ec82c93a645c4e5fdeb39 |website=Semantic Scholar |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EnteringHades&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gfu1Mx9If6wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=entering%20hades&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=entering%20hades&amp;f=false|title=Entering Hades: The Double Life of a Serial Killer|last=Leake|first=John|date=2007-11-13|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=9781429996334|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to his death, Unterweger asserted his intention to seek an appeal, therefore, under Austrian law, his guilty verdict was not considered legally binding after his death.&lt;ref name=EnteringHades/&gt;

== In popular culture ==
In a 2008 performance, actor [[John Malkovich]] portrayed Unterweger's life in a performance for one actor, two sopranos, and period orchestra entitled ''Seduction and Despair,'' which premiered at Barnum Hall in Santa Monica, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2008-05-01/stage/hearing-john-malkovich/ |title=Los Angeles Stage - Seduction and Despair: Hearing John Malkovich - page 1 |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fully staged version of the production, entitled ''The Infernal Comedy'' premiered in [[Vienna]] in July 2009.  The show has since been performed throughout [[Europe]], [[North America]] and [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theinfernalcomedy.org/jart/prj3/wak/projekt.jart?rel=en&amp;content-id=1266692789095&amp;reserve-mode=active | title=Infernal Comedy Official Web Page | accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Elisabeth Scharang directed a film called ''[[Jack (2015 film)|Jack]]'' about Unterweger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/locarno-film-review-jack-1201569201/ |title=Locarno Film Review: 'Jack' |accessdate=28 August 2015 |work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Broad Green Pictures]] is also developing a film ''Entering Hades'' starring [[Michael Fassbender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=Michael Fassbender to Play Serial Killer in True Crime Story 'Entering Hades' (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/michael-fassbender-starring-entering-hades-1201764933/|accessdate=May 4, 2016|work=Variety|date=May 3, 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of the police investigation, pursuit and prosecution of Unterweger is the subject of an episode of ''[[The FBI Files]]'' titled "Killer Abroad" [[List of The FBI Files episodes|(Season 2, Episode 14)]]. He is also the subject of an episode of [[Biography (TV series)|Biography]] titled "Poet of Death".

[[Austrians|Austrian]] musician [[Falco (musician)|Falco]]'s controversial song "[[Jeanny (song)|Jeanny (Part-I)]]" depicts a murder and rapist's thoughts, and its promotional video contains a number of references to crime scenes both real and fictional; while the "news break" in it (which is also heard in the song) refers in an oblique way to Unterweger, who was still in jail at the time of the single's release.

The ID Channel's true crime series Horror at the Cecil Hotel's premiere episode 1402 told Unterweger's story.  The episode aired on Monday October 16, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Horror at the Cecil Hotel|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7529610/?ref_=ttfc_fc_tt|accessdate=May 2, 2018|date=October 16, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[:de:Bloodsucking Zombies from Outer Space|Bloodsucking Zombies from Outer Space]] song "The Legendary Jack", is based in the strangler's life.

"'''Kill Rock 'n Roll'''" is a [[Promotional recording|promotional single]] by [[Armenian American]] [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[System of a Down]], released on July 2006. It is the third track of their fifth album ''[[Hypnotize (album)|Hypnotize]]'' and it was one of the few songs from Hypnotize that was performed at live shows before the release of the album.

The lyrics, written by [[Daron Malakian]], supposedly refer to a [[rabbit]] that Malakian ran over in his car one night (the "Rock 'N Roll" of the title).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=6236 Kill Rock N' Roll by System Of A Down Songfacts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Malpa landslide''' was one of the worst landslides in [[India]]. On 18 August 1998 at 3.00 a.m., massive landslides wiped away the entire village of Malpa in the [[Pithoragarh district]] of [[Uttarakhand]], then in [[Uttar Pradesh]] in Kali Valley of Higher [[Kumaon division]] of the [[Himalayas]]. The rockfall started on 16 August bringing down huge rocks which initially killed three mules. A total of 221 people died, including 60 Hindu pilgrims traveling to Tibet as part of "Kailash Manas Sarovar Yatra". One noted death was that of the Indian dancer [[Protima Bedi]]. The rockfall continued till 21 August. As the area lies in a [[seismic zone]], the earthquakes of 1979 and 1980 may have been the underlying cause, as was attributed by a report of the [[Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology]][http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/feb25/articles13.htm][http://www.wihg.res.in/]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pithoragarh Panorama.jpg|thumb|800px|center|Pithoragarh valley Panoramic view]]

== Causes of landslide ==
The landslide generated around one million cubic meters of rock fall and debris flow. This debris partially blocked the [[Sharda River]]. The landslide prevailed mostly due to steep, almost vertical, slopes of rock above the valley. In addition to the slopes, the proximity of the rock mass to major tectonic plates, major rainfall into the porous rock, and stress on the rock formations all contributed to the landslide. Natural disasters in the area have been attributed to ″unplanned construction and urbanization on the ﬂuvial and un-consolidated materials produced by [[active fault]]s/thrusts in various sectors.″&lt;ref&gt;Neotectonically triggered instability around the palaeolake regime in Central Kumaun Himalaya, India [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273521968_Neotectonically_triggered_instability_around_the_palaeolake_regime_in_Central_Kumaun_Himalaya_India][https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275999558_Neotectonically_triggered_instability_around_the_palaeolake_regime_in_Central_Kumaun_Himalaya_India]&lt;/ref&gt;

The slide demonstrated the distressed state of rock in the Himalayan region because of the drift of the Indian plate northward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Catastrophic mass movement of 1998 monsoons at Malpa in Kali Valley, Kumaun Himalaya (India)|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X00000325|journal = Geomorphology|date = 2000-11-01|pages = 169–180|volume = 35|issue = 3–4|doi = 10.1016/S0169-555X(00)00032-5|first = S.

The '''Malta International Airshow''' is an annual [[air show]] held at the [[Malta International Airport]] organized by the Malta Aviation Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thank you for visiting our website|url=http://www.mas.org.mt/|website=Malta Aviation Society|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first held in September 1993 over [[Marsamxett Harbour]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.maltairshow.com/Information/|website=Malta International Airshow|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then moved to Malta International Airport with the exception of the years 2007 and 2009. During these years, the event was held at St. Paul's Bay due to the construction of new hangars at the airport, where cranes would have been a hazard for the low flying aircraft.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

'''New York Fashion Week''', held in February and September of each year, is a semi-annual series of events (generally lasting 7–9 days) when international [[Fashion design|fashion collections]] are shown to buyers, the press, and the general public. It is one of four major [[fashion week]]s in the world, collectively known as the "Big 4," along with those in [[Paris Fashion Week|Paris]], [[London Fashion Week|London]] and [[Milan Fashion Week|Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bradford |first1=Julie |title=Fashion Journalism |publisher=Routledge |year=2014 |page=129 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2xeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Susan |last=Dillon |title=The Fundamentals of Fashion Management |publisher=A&amp;C Black |year=2011 |page=115 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XFMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Council of Fashion Designers of America]] (CFDA) created the modern notion of a centralized “New York Fashion Week” in 1993, although cities like London were already using their city’s name in conjunction with the words “fashion week” in the 1980s. NYFW is based on a much older series of events called “Press Week,” founded in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newyorkfashionweeklive.com/history-of-new-york-fashion-week |title=History of New York Fashion Week – New York Fashion Week |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has consisted of numerous branded events, such as Olympus Fashion Week New York&lt;ref name="olympusamerica.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/cpg_pressDetails.asp?pressNo=286 |title=OLYMPUS NAMED TITLE SPONSOR OF NEW YORK FASHION WEEK |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025095552/http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/cpg_pressDetails.asp%3FpressNo%3D286 |archivedate=October 25, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and MADE Fashion Week,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madefashionweek.com/ |title=MADE Fashion Week |publisher=MADE  Fashion Week |work=madefashionweek.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many independent fashion productions around town.&lt;ref name="nymag.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/fashion/fashioncalendar/fashionweek/ |title=New York Fashion Week Schedule – Shows by Day and Designer |work=Nymag.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producers of New York Fashion Week include [[IMG (company)|IMG]], The SOCIETY Fashion Week, [[FTL Moda]] in conjunction with [[Fashion Week Online]], Style 360, Art Hearts Fashion, Style Fashion Week, and ASC Fashion week among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NEW YORK FASHION WEEK PRODUCERS |url=http://fashionweekonline.com/new-york/producers |website=FWO |accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/madeline-stuart-down-syndrome-fashion-show_us_56c321b7e4b0b40245c7cc60 |title=Inspiring Model With Down Syndrome Returns To Fashion Week |work=The Huffington Post |date=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://mbfashionweek.com/designers/ftl-moda |title=Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week |website=mbfashionweek.com |access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fashionweekonline.com/new-york/producers|title=New York Fashion Week Producers {{!}} Fashion Week Online®|work=Fashion Week Online®|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A centralized calendar of citywide events (including those affiliated with WME/IMG) is kept by the CFDA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cfda.com/the-latest/cfda-fashion-calendar |title=CFDA + Fashion Calendar |first= |last=CFDA |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was acquired from calendar founder [[Ruth Finley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fashionweekdaily.com/the-cfda-acquires-ruth-finleys-fashion-calendar |title=The CFDA Purchases The Fashion Calendar With The Promise To Streamline Fashion Week |date=July 25, 2014 |work=fashionweekdaily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another calendar is kept by Fashion Week Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fashionweekonline.com/new-york/schedule|title=Official NYFW Schedule {{!}} Fashion Week Online®|work=Fashion Week Online®|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic impact of New York Fashion Week is estimated at $887 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cfda.com/blog/nyfw-memo-from-the-cfda |title=NYFW Memo from the CFDA |work=cfda.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin ==
The first New York Fashion Week was created in 1943 by [[Eleanor Lambert]], press director of the American fashion industry’s first promotional organization, the New York Dress Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cfda.com/about/history |title=History |work=cfda.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event, the world's first organized [[fashion week]], was called "Press Week", and was created to attract attention away from French fashion during [[World War II]], when fashion industry insiders were unable to travel to Paris to see French fashion shows.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fortini |first=Amanda |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2135561 |title=A brief history of the fashion show |work=Slate.com |date=2006-02-08 |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also meant to showcase American designers for [[fashion journalism|fashion journalists]], who had neglected U.S. fashion innovations.

Press Week was a success, and fashion magazines like ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', which were normally filled with French designs, increasingly featured American fashion.&lt;ref name="slate" /&gt;

By the mid-1950s, the event was known as "Press Week of New York". Spring 1951 (held February 1951) was the 16th Annual Press Week of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inv.stparchive.com/Archive/INV/INV02011951P10.php |title=Indian Valley Record  February 1, 1951 Page   10 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consolidation as "7th on Sixth"==
In 1993, the CFDA, led by president [[Stan Herman]] and executive director [[Fern Mallis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://loewsmagazine.com/stan-herman/ |title=The People's Designer – Stan Herman |work=Loews Magazine |first=Louis |last=Chunovic |date=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://fashionista.com/2015/06/stan-herman-father-of-fashion-week |title=How Stan Herman, Father of Fashion Week, Changed the U.S. Fashion Industry |work=Fashionista |first=Chantal |last=Fernandez |date=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; consolidated the citywide events known as "New York Fashion Week" by staging them in a cluster of white tents in [[Bryant Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mell |first=Eila |date=2011 |title=New York Fashion Week: The Designers, the Models, the Fashions of the Bryant Park Era |url=https://www.amazon.com/New-York-Fashion-Week-Designers/dp/0762441917 |publisher=Running Press |page=10 |isbn=0762441917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/09/fashion/fern-mallis-pitching-a-few-new-tents-of-her-own.html |title=Pitching a Few New Tents of Her Own |date=February 9, 2012 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Spindler |first=Amy |title=Designers Turn New York Into a Fashion Big Top |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/nyregion/designers-turn-new-york-into-a-fashion-big-top.html |work=The New York Times |date=October 31, 1993 |accessdate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was branded with the trademark "7th on Sixth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.racked.com/2015/1/22/7560555/new-york-fashion-week-changes |title=The Glamorous Past, Troubled Present, and Uncertain Future of NYFW |first=Chavie |last=Lieber |date=January 22, 2015 |work=racked.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
In 2001, "7th on Sixth" was sold to [[IMG (company)|IMG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Horyn |first=Cathy |title=Front Row: Designers council sells sponsorship of New York Fashion Week to IMG, the sports management and marketing company |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/06/style/front-row-designers-council-sells-sponsorship-new-york-fashion-week-img-sports.html |work=The New York Times |date=February 6, 2001 |accessdate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the camera company Olympus became a sponsor of IMG's events, which were then renamed "Olympus Fashion Week."&lt;ref name="olympusamerica.com" /&gt;

In 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/events/fashion |title=EventsPartnerships |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercedes-Benz became title sponsor of the IMG-produced events, adding New York to its roster of international "Mercedes-Benz fashion weeks,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mbfashionweek.com/ |title=Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week |work=mbfashionweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dubbing it "MB Fashion Week New York."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mercedes-threatens-bail-new-york-748286 |title=Mercedes Threatens to Bail on New York Fashion Week |work=hollywoodreporter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, IMG/Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week New York left the Bryant Park tents, relocating to the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]].&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/new-york-fashion-week-is-759258 |title=It's Official: New York Fashion Week Is Leaving Lincoln Center |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/fashion/03TENTS.html |title=A New Home for New York Fashion Week |date=February 3, 2009 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, New York designers began live-streaming runway shows, following London, who began in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/london-fashion-week-to-be-streamed-live-1904888.html |title=London Fashion Week to be streamed live |date=February 19, 2010 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/fashion/live-streaming-of-runway-shows-new-york-fashion-week.html |title=Way Off the Runway: Live Streaming of Fashion Week |date=September 8, 2011 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streams were originally offered on YouTube, and later on other sites.

In 2013, IMG and its New York Fashion Week events were sold to [[William Morris Endeavor]] (WME) and Silver Lake Partners for $2.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/02/wme-img-merger-ari-emanuel |title=Ari Emanuel’s Risky and Possibly Catastrophic WME-IMG Merger |first=William D. |last=Cohan |work=vanityfair.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://img.com/news/news/2013/decembmer/img-worldwide-to-be-acquired-by-silver-lake-partne.aspx |title=IMG WORLDWIDE TO BE ACQUIRED BY SILVER LAKE PARTNERS AND WILLIAM MORRIS ENDEAVOR |work=IMG |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704065440/http://img.com/news/news/2013/decembmer/img-worldwide-to-be-acquired-by-silver-lake-partne.aspx |archivedate=July 4, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the CFDA acquired FashionCalendar.com from [[Ruth Finley]], who had managed it (originally in paper, then digital format) for more than 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://fashionista.com/2014/07/cfda-acquires-fashion-calendar&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fashioncalendar.com/about-us/ |title=Fashion Calendar |work=fashioncalendar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Mercedes-Benz announced its departure as title sponsor from WME/IMG's events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/img-loses-mercedes-as-fashion-761135 |title=IMG Loses Mercedes as New York Fashion Week Sponsor |work=hollywoodreporter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer Kanye West announced he would gladly take over sponsorship of the event.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In March 2015, WME/IMG announced that it had acquired MADE Fashion Week, which takes place during WME/IMG's events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/wme-img-acquires-made-fashion-week-1201458187/ |title=IMG Acquires MADE Fashion Week |first=Marianne |last=Zumberge |date=March 23, 2015 |work=IMG}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://img.com/news/news/2015/march/wme---img-acquires-made-fashion-week.aspx |title=IIMG ACQUIRES MADE FASHION WEEK |work=IMG |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704131015/http://img.com/news/news/2015/march/wme---img-acquires-made-fashion-week.aspx |archivedate=July 4, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, IMG's events were moved from Lincoln Center to Spring Studios.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/fashion/for-fashion-week-this-fall-location-location-location.html |title=For Fashion Week This Fall: Location, Location, Location |date=January 8, 2015 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/new-york-fashion-week-lincoln-center-10108237/ |title=New York Fashion Week Leaves Lincoln Center |first=Lisa |last=Lockwood |date=April 13, 2015 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current location==
Following the loss of Bryant Park and later Lincoln Center as hosting site for New York Fashion Week, the event is no longer held in one central location. Locations have included a waterfront carnival, converted railway terminals and a former post office.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amny.com/lifestyle/fashion-week/new-york-fashion-week-when-where-what-to-wear-1.10833995&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, Dr. Danielle Sheypuk became the first wheelchair-using model to appear in a show for New York Fashion Week; she modeled for designer Carrie Hammer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lankston |first=Charlie |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2988789/Woman-history-wheelchair-bound-model-appear-New-York-Fashion-Week-lands-debut-clothing-campaign.html |title=Dr. Danielle Sheypuk the first wheelchair-bound model in NYFW lands her debut clothing campaign |work=Daily Mail |date= |accessdate=2015-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, Karen Crespo became the first quadruple-amputee to walk at New York Fashion Week, also for Carrie Hammer.

On December 12, 2014, a New York state court approved a settlement in a lawsuit by community activists over whether allowing the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week tents in [[Damrosch Park]] was a violation of the [[public trust doctrine]]. In accordance with the settlement, the City of New York, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, and [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] agreed not to renew their contract with IMG. As a result, the February 2015 Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week was the last one staged in Damrosch Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New York Fashion Week Booted Out of Lincoln Center |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/12/18/business/ap-us-fashion-week-booted.html |work=The New York Times |date=December 18, 2014 |accessdate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, the CFDA announced that it had hired the Boston Consulting Group to study revising the format of New York Fashion Week to adapt to changes brought about by social media. One option being explored is to bifurcate the event, with private showroom appointments of next season's designs for buyers and public fashion shows displaying in-season merchandise for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lockwood |first=Lisa |title=NYFW Going Consumer?

The season ended with a number of designers either experimenting with, or planning to adopt, a "see now, buy now model," with items available from the runway immediately after (or even during) the show, rather than six months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/fashion-week-fall-2016/news/a14169/fashion-week-changes/ |title=Is This The Last Traditional New York Fashion Week? |date=February 14, 2016 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charge was led by brands such as [[Burberry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/fashion/burberry-announces-a-see-now-buy-now-system-for-new-collections.html |title=Burberry Announces a See Now/Buy Now System for New Collections |date=February 6, 2016 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; although experiments in the format can be traced back to earlier shows by designers such as [[Diane von Furstenberg]].

Spring/summer 2017 events will be held September 8–15, 2016. (Fashion weeks are traditionally named for the season the clothes will appear at retail, six months after the events, although the trend may be changing due to fundamental shifts in the retail cycle.)&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

The advent of "see now, buy now" shopping is expected to further transform fashion week, as collections become "in season" and select items are offered from the runway in real time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/fashion-week-fall-2016/news/a14169/fashion-week-changes/ |title=Is This The Last Traditional New York Fashion Week? |date=2016-02-14 |website=Harper's BAZAAR |access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2018 ===
Fall/winter took place February 5-8, 2018, and spring/summer 2019 will take place September 6-14, 2018. In February, major venues were Spring Studios, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nyfw.com/schedule-february-8-2018|title=Schedule: February 8, 2018|work=NYFW: The Shows|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attendance==
Admission to shows at New York Fashion Week is typically in the form of [[accreditation]], with specific events by invitation only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chan |first=Sewell |title=Fashion Week: Not Open to the Public |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/06/fashion-week-not-open-to-the-public |work=The New York Times |date=September 6, 2007 |accessdate=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==No "Official" New York Fashion Week==
In spite of CFDA's claim to run the "official" New York Fashion Week calendar,&lt;ref&gt;https://cfda.com/fashion-calendar/official-schedules&lt;/ref&gt; and as further purported by publications such as ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/the-tentative-official-nyfw-calendar-is-here-10953303/&lt;/ref&gt; it has been pointed out in publications such as ''The Fashion Law'' that CFDA has "little, in any, legal rights in the NYFW name".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefashionlaw.com/home/the-cfda-has-little-if-any-rights-in-the-nyfw-name&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, trademark rights remain unclear, at best.

==Trademark litigation==
In 2013 Fashion Week Inc., founded by Trisha Paravas, registered the [[trademark]]s “New York Fashion Week,” “NYFW”, and “NYFW The Runway Shows” to use in conjunction with the production of its consumer-based fashion shows. On June 28, 2016 Fashion Week Inc. filed a lawsuit for $10 million against [[Council of Fashion Designers of America|CFDA]] and [[WME-IMG]] for trademark counterfeiting, [[trademark infringement]], [[false designation of origin]], dilution, and [[unfair competition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cullins |first1=A |title=WME-IMG and CFDA Facing $10M Lawsuit for "Usurping" New York Fashion Week Trademark. |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/wme-img-cfda-facing-10m-908838 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hoshikawa |first1=K |title=The CFDA is being sued over 'NYFW' trademark |url=http://fashionista.com/2016/07/cfda-nyfw-trademark-lawsuit |website=Fashionista |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Drain |first1=K |title=New York Fashion Week Logo Lawsuit: CFDA, WME-IMG Sued |url=http://www.fashiontimes.com/articles/26917/20160706/new-york-fashion-week-logo-lawsuit-cfda-wme-img-sued.htm |website=Fashion Times |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The CFDA Has Little – If Any – Legal Rights in the NYFW Name |url=http://www.thefashionlaw.com/home/the-cfda-has-little-if-any-rights-in-the-nyfw-name |website=The Fashion Law |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UPDATED: CFDA, WME-IMG Sued for Using New York Fashion Week Trademark |url=http://www.thefashionlaw.com/home/the-cfda-wme-img-sued-over-new-york-fashion-week-trademark |website=The Fashion Law |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 12, 2016, the court denied Fashion Week Inc.'s motion for a [[preliminary injunction]].&lt;ref name=hballp&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://hballp.com/wp-content/uploads/PI-decision.pdf |title=Memorandum Opinion and Order |last= |first= |date=August 12, 2016 |website= |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Koeltl held that CFDA and WME-IMG made "a persuasive argument that the terms 'New York Fashion Week' and NYFW have been associated with them and not with [Fashion Week Inc.] who has attempted to cash in on the decades of publicity for New York Fashion Week that [Fashion Week Inc.] had nothing to do with."&lt;ref name=hballp /&gt;{{rp|22}}  The court also noted that "the evidence shows that [Fashion Week Inc.] produced at most two shows while using the trademark 'New York Fashion Week', and has produced no shows since registering NYFW in December 2015. "&lt;ref name=hballp /&gt;{{rp|24}}

'''"New York Mining Disaster 1941"''' is the debut American single by the British pop group the [[Bee Gees]], released on 14 April 1967. It was written by [[Barry Gibb|Barry]] and [[Robin Gibb]]. Barring a moderately successful reissue of their Australian single "[[Spicks and Specks (song)|Spicks and Specks]]," it was the first single release of the group's international career and their first song to hit the charts in both the UK and the US. It was produced by [[Ossie Byrne]] with their manager [[Robert Stigwood]] as executive producer. The song was the first track of side two on the group's international debut album, ''[[Bee Gees' 1st]].'' This was the first single with Australian drummer [[Colin Petersen]] as an official member of the band.

==Background and writing==
On 3 January 1967, the Gibb brothers, with their parents and Byrne, set sail from Australia to England on the ship [[Fairsky]], reaching Southampton on 6 February. The brothers performed on board in exchange for passage. Later, the Gibb brothers auditioned for Stigwood; they passed, and they signed to [[RSO Records|Robert Stigwood Organisation]] on 24 February. "New York Mining Disaster 1941" was their first song that was written in 1967.&lt;ref name="own"/&gt;

The first recording session of the Bee Gees after returning to England was a second version of "[[Town of Tuxley Toymaker, Part 1]]," a song recorded by [[Billy J. Kramer|Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas]], but was first recorded by Jon Blanchfield in Australia. Kramer's version was recorded on 4 March 1967 in [[IBC Studios]], London, with the Gibb brothers on background vocals.&lt;ref name="own"/&gt;

Barry and Robin Gibb wrote the song while sitting on a darkened staircase at [[Polydor Records]] following a power cut. The echo of the passing lift inspired them to imagine that they were trapped in a mine.&lt;ref name="accident"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7494 |title=New York Mining Disaster 1941 (Songfacts) |publisher=Songfacts |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song recounts the story of a miner trapped in a cave-in. He is sharing a photo of his wife with a colleague ("Mr. Jones") while they hopelessly wait to be rescued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/song/new-york-mining-disaster-1941-mt0030257568 |title=Bee Gees - New York Mining Disaster 1941 |last=Elias |first=Jason |work=[[Allmusic]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the liner notes for their box-set ''[[Tales from the Brothers Gibb]]'' (1990), this song was inspired by the 1966 [[Aberfan disaster|Aberfan mining disaster]] in [[Wales]]. According to Robin, there actually had also been a mining disaster in New York in 1939, but not in 1941.&lt;ref name="also"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brothersgibb.org/history-part-4.html |title=History Part 4 - The story about the Bee Gees |last=Adriaensen |first=Marion |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second and third verses, the lyrical lines get slower and slower, as if to indicate that life is about to end for the miners. On the second chorus, the drums get louder. On the second verse, when Robin sings the line "I keep straining my ears to hear a sound," a violin was featured in response on Robin's line.

==Recording and composition==
[[File:NYMiningdisaster68sheet.png|thumb|left|1967 sheet music cover, Abigail Music, Ltd., London. "Recorded by the Bee Gees on Polydor".]]
On 7 March, the Bee Gees recorded "New York Mining Disaster 1941" in six takes, along with three other songs: "[[I Can't See Nobody]]," "Red Chair, Fade Away," and "Turn of the Century." The orchestra and some other parts were added on 13 March.&lt;ref name="own"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/67.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1967 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "New York Mining Disaster 1941" was done first, and it may have already been nominated as the first single on the strength of the Polydor demo.&lt;ref name="accident"/&gt;

The song begins in the chord of A minor; as Maurice explained: "There's a lot of weird sounds on this song like the Jew's harp, the string quartet, and of course the special way that Barry plays that guitar chord. Because of his tuning when he plays the minor at the beginning of the song which is different from a conventional A minor, it's a nice mixture when I play my conventional tuning together with Barry's tuning because his [[Open D tuning|open D]] and mine are different." Barry said, "It's Hawaiian tuning, there they play the same way I do. I got a guitar for my ninth birthday and the guy who lived across the road from us just came back from Hawaii and he was the one who taught me that tuning, that's how it started and I never changed."&lt;ref name="also"/&gt;

Robin Gibb took both leading and backing vocals, singing the high harmony while Barry sang the low harmony on the first and second verse:

[[Maurice Gibb]] recalled in a June 2001 interview with ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine: "The opening chord doesn't sound like a conventional A minor. Barry was using the open D tuning he'd been taught when he was nine, and I was playing it in conventional tuning. It gives an unusual blend. People went crazy trying to figure out why they couldn't copy it."&lt;ref name="accident"/&gt;

Robin Gibb recalled to ''The Mail on Sunday'' on November 1, 2009: "We recorded this at London's IBC studio because it was dark and emulated a mining shaft. The result was a very lonely sound."&lt;ref name="accident"/&gt;

==Release and reception==
At the time, rumours circulated that the Bee Gees were [[The Beatles]] recording under a pseudonym (the Bee Gees' name was alleged to be code for "Beatles Group"), in part because the record referenced NEMS Enterprises ([[Brian Epstein]]'s management agency, which had just been joined by Bee Gees' manager [[Robert Stigwood]]). The song is unusual in that the lyrics do not contain the song's title, though the originally planned title, "Have You Seen My Wife, Mr. Jones," does appear in the chorus.&lt;ref name=pc49&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19826/m1/ |title=Show 49 - The British are Coming! The British are Coming!: With an emphasis on Donovan, the Bee Gees and the Who. (Part 6) |publisher=Unt Digital Library |accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Atco Records|Atco]] distributed promos with a blank label and the suggestion that it was an English group whose name started with B. Many [[Disc jockey|DJ]]s thought it was a new Beatles song and played the song heavily. Atco also retitled the song "New York Mining Disaster 1941 (Have You Seen My Wife, Mr. Jones?)" to make sure people could find it in the shops.&lt;ref name="own"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://britishinvasionbands.com/the-bands/the-bee-gees/?doing_wp_cron=1363251960.7064080238342285156250 |title=The Bee Gees on British Invasion Bands |publisher=British Invasion |accessdate=14 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022175804/http://britishinvasionbands.com/the-bands/the-bee-gees/?doing_wp_cron=1363251960.7064080238342285156250 |archivedate=22 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Beatles|Beatles]] lead guitarist [[George Harrison]] met Maurice Gibb at a party several years later, and told him that he had bought a copy of "New York Mining Disaster 1941" because he thought it sounded so much like The Beatles. Maurice's response to Harrison was that the resemblance "was unintentional" and Harrison said, "I knew that, I admire your work."&lt;ref name="work"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KugbDQHX0R8C&amp;pg=PT258&amp;dq=new+york+mining+disaster+1941+they+can+tell+the+beatles&amp;hl=fil&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nuvTULrrGaeiigeQrYCAAg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ |title=The Bee Gees - Tales Of The Brothers Gibb |last=Hughes |first=Andrew |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barry Gibb explained about this song:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If you sounded like the Beatles and also could write a hit single, then the hype of the machine would go into action, and your company would make sure people thought you sounded like the Beatles or thought you were the Beatles. And that sold you, attracted attention to you. It was good for us because everyone thought it was the Beatles under a different name."&lt;ref name="work"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robin Gibb explained about this track:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...all the DJs on radio stations in the US picked it up immediately thinking it was the Beatles, and it was a hit on that basis. It established us in those early years. It helped our following record which was nothing like the Beatles."&lt;ref name="work"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The success of this song owes a lot more to the perseverance of Robert Stigwood than he has previously been given credit for. "We had quite a hard time at getting the Bee Gees played. We weren't all totally convinced that Stigwood was picking the right song to plug, but at the end of the day, he was a forceful character. All of these guys were... [[Chas Chandler]] (manager of [[Jimi Hendrix]]) was the same, [[Kit Lambert]] (manager of [[The Who]]) was the same. They all argued their case with passion, you know, they lived it, they were like that," conceded [[Polydor Records|Polydor]]'s [[Alan Bates]]. When the ''Disc &amp; Music Echo'' reported "widespread rumours" that this song had been written by [[Lennon-McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]], Robin countered with, "Rubbish! We've always written our own songs. I've been writing since I was ten, before Lennon and McCartney were even on stage. People can say what they like. If they don't believe us, they can ask The Beatles."

Bassist Maurice Gibb, though, had previously said that "New York Mining Disaster 1941" was in fact influenced by the Beatles:&lt;ref name="work"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"New York Mining Disaster 1941" was a total rip-off of The Beatles, we were so influenced by them. In fact it started a mystery [in the USA] about us, because they started playing [it] and saying, 'They're this new group from England that begins with a B and finished with an s' so they all said, 'Ah, it's The Beatles, not naming it, they're doing that trick again.' The disc jockey would play it and play it and play it and, 'Guess who it is?' and people would guess, and they wouldn't get the answer. I heard [the idea] came actually from [[Ahmet Ertegun]] and [[Jerry Wexler]]. To us it was an honour, to actually think we were as good as The Beatles."&lt;ref name="work"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Music video and live performances==
On the video, the band only features four members (but [[Vince Melouney]] later joined the band), Barry playing his guitar, Maurice playing his [[Rickenbacker 4001]], Robin Gibb on vocals and drummer [[Colin Petersen]] wears a hat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps-Qq7ucMA0 |title=Bee Gees - New York Mining Disaster 1941 (1967) |publisher=You Tube |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group found time to record their first BBC session at Playhouse Theatre, Northumberland Avenue, London, with producer Bill Bebb, on which they performed this song, with the songs "In My Own Time," "One Minute Woman," and "Cucumber Castle." When the BBC Light Programme's ''Saturday Club'' presented by Brian Matthew was broadcast on April 22, it was noted that there were "rave reviews from the audition panel."&lt;ref name="work"/&gt; On the song's promotional clip, the band only feature four members (the three Gibb brothers and drummer [[Colin Petersen]]) The group (Barry, Robin, Maurice, Colin and Vince) made their first British TV appearance on ''Top of the Pops'' performing this song on May 11 and were rather awe-struck at the company they were keeping.&lt;ref name="work"/&gt; On 20 May 1967, the group performed this song on ''[[Beat-Club]],'' a German TV program.

The Bee Gees performed this song on 21 July 1967 at the Stockholm Palladium, Stockholm, Sweden., 12 August 1967 at The Civic Hall, Wolverhampton, England and Christ the King College at Newport, England on 27 September 1967. Since 1967, the song has been part of every Bee Gees concert, eventually becoming part of their acoustic medley performed during the middle of the concert. It was also performed on the show ''[[Beat-Club]]'' in [[Germany]], on that performance Robin wears a hat and plays [[violin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSLDUGKWEc |title=Bee Gees - New York Mining Disaster 1941 Live in Beat Club |publisher=You Tube |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was performed by the group in 1973 on ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' with Barry and Maurice on rhythm guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ5tSc3tqOE |title=Bee Gees - New York Mining Disaster - live, 1973 |publisher=You Tube |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The 1969 [[David Bowie]] song "[[Space Oddity]]" owes a debt to the style, arrangement and lyrics of "New York Mining Disaster 1941." Like "New York Mining Disaster 1941," "Space Oddity" is about a trapped man who is doomed to die, and the song is similarly structured as a series of statements addressed to another person. "'Space Oddity' was a Bee Gees type song," Bowie’s colleague John "Hutch" Hutchinson has said. "David knew it, and he said so at the time, the way he sang it, it’s a Bee Gees thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://davidbowie.com/users/lunamagic/space1.html |title=David Bowie - Space Oddity |accessdate=13 March 2013 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Marc Bolan]] explained: "I remember David playing me 'Space Oddity' in his room and I loved it and he said he needed a sound like the Bee Gees, who were very big then."

[[Paul McCartney]] said: "It was the 'Mining Disaster' song that [Robert Stigwood] played me. I said 'sign them, they're great!' And they went on to be even greater."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www14.brinkster.com/corteza/bg/citas.htm |title=Bee Gees |publisher=14.brinkster.com |accessdate=2014-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235737/http://www14.brinkster.com/corteza/bg/citas.htm |archivedate=2013-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese Novelist [[Haruki Murakami]] made "New York Mining Disaster" the title of one of his short stories. The piece was included in his collection "[[Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Umrigar |first=Thrity |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2006/10/01/murakami_pulls_mind_bending_stories_from_the_ruins_of_broken_rules/ |title=Murakami pulls mind-bending stories from the ruins of broken rules - The Boston Globe |website=Boston.com |date=2006-10-01 |accessdate=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cover versions==

'''''Odigitis'' festival''' (named after the central publication of [[KNE]] and the poem of [[Kostas Varnalis]] "Odigitis"), is a series of annual festivals organized in most of the major towns and cities of [[Greece]] by the [[Communist Youth of Greece]] (KNE).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8002">'''Operation Anti Sexual Harassment''', (Arabic: قوة ضد التحرش, transliterated: Quwwa did al-taharrush, also known as OpAntiSH) is an activist group in Cairo, Egypt, whose goal is to prevent [[sexual harassment]] and assault, and in particular the [[Mass sexual assault in Egypt|mass sexual assaults]] that occur during protests and religious festivals. The group is known for intervening in assaults by mobs in Cairo's [[Tahrir Square]] and is one of several that have begun to organize against sexual harassment of women in Tahrir since the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]].&lt;ref name=DailyNews&gt;{{cite web|last=Hegab|first=Salma|date=27 January 2013|title=19 Sexual Harassment cases in Tahrir, Sky News reporter assaulted in Alexandria|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/01/27/19-sexual-harassment-cases-in-tahrir-sky-news-reporter-assaulted-in-alexandria/|publisher=Daily News Egypt|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|last=Kingsley|first=Patrick|date=27 January 2013|title=Tahrir Square sexual assaults reported during anniversary clashes|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/27/tahrir-square-sexual-assaults-reported|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{further|Mass sexual assault in Egypt}}
Although sexual harassment in the streets of Egypt predates the 2011 revolution, and is thought to have been a tactic of the Mubarak-era state used against female activists since 2005, reported cases of group sexual assaults during demonstrations in Tahrir square have been on the rise since 2011.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=Monitor /&gt; The first to gain international attention was South African reporter [[Lara Logan]], who was sexually assaulted by a gang of men on 11 February 2011, the night of Mubarak's resignation.&lt;ref name=WeN /&gt; It has been reported that at least 25 women were sexually assaulted in Tahrir during [[Timeline of the 2011 Egyptian revolution under Mohamed Morsi (from November 2012)#January|protests in January 2013]] on the occasion of the revolution's two-year anniversary.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt; In accounts collected by OpAntiSh and other groups and some published in social media, women describe being stripped, beaten, molested and raped.&lt;ref name=DailyNews /&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=WeN /&gt;

While some attacks appear to be spontaneous and stem from [[mob mentality]], OpAntiSH activists believe that at least some of the sexual assaults are planned and carried out by organized gangs, to keep women from participating in the revolution's protests in Tahrir square.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=Monitor /&gt;&lt;ref name=WeN /&gt;&lt;ref name=EgyptInd1 /&gt; They point to the timing and patterns of the attacks and persistence of the harassers when confronted.  Dalia Abdel Hameed, of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) has said, “The easiest way to punish women in this country is through sexuality. In a culture that blames the victim, women start to believe that they shouldn’t go to the square.”&lt;ref name=Monitor /&gt;

==Organization==
OpAntiSH was established in November 2012 by volunteers, including those affiliated with [[Tamer El Said#Mosireen|Mosireen]], an Egyptian revolutionary media group.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=EgyptInd1&gt;{{cite web|last=Charbel|first=Jano |date=8 December 2012|title=Hands off: Initiatives grow fighting sexual harassment in Tahrir and elsewhere|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/hands-initiatives-grow-fighting-sexual-harassment-tahrir-and-elsewhere|publisher=Egypt Independent|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  OpAntiSH first appeared in Tahrir Square on 30 November 2012, during [[2012 Egyptian protests|protests]] against President [[Mohamed Morsi]]'s [[Mohamed Morsi#November 2012 declaration|constitutional declaration]], alongside groups like [[Banat Misr Khatt Ahmar]] (Egypt’s Girls Are a Red Line), which was founded earlier in 2012.&lt;ref name=EgyptInd1 /&gt; OpAntiSH's campaigns against sexual harassment are supported by a coalition of organizations like [[Harassmap]], which collects and maps crowd-sourced data about sexual harassment in Egypt, and [[Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights]], a human rights organization founded in 2002.&lt;ref name=DailyNews /&gt;&lt;ref name=WeN&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Jessica|date=25 January 2013|title=Egyptians Patrol Tahrir Square for Mob Sex Assaults|url=http://womensenews.org/story/sexual-harassment/130124/egyptians-patrol-tahrir-square-mob-sex-assaults#.UQW-JqFQBjY|publisher=Women's eNews Inc|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EgyptInd2&gt;{{cite web|last=Dale|first=Tom |date=27 January 2013|title=Sexual assault in Tahrir: What it means, and how to stop it|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/opinion/sexual-assault-tahrir-what-it-means-and-how-stop-it|publisher=Egypt Independent|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; OpAntiSH's slogan is "A safe square for all."&lt;ref name=EgyptInd1 /&gt; The group continues to gather new volunteers, some joining to help protect others after being rescued from [[sexual assault]] themselves.&lt;ref name=EgyptInd2 /&gt;

==Methods==
OpAntiSH uses a variety of methods to combat sexual harassment, in attempts to remove barriers to women's participation in street protests by keeping them physically and emotionally safe.&lt;ref name=Monitor&gt;{{cite web|last=El Sirgany|first=Sarah|date=7 December 2012|title=In Egypt, Women Lead Fight Against Mob Sexual Assaults|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2012/al-monitor/egypt-sexual-harrassment.html|publisher=Al Monitor|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteers in the group conduct outreach and publicity to raise awareness of sexual harassment, and provide legal, medical, and psychological support as well as safe houses that can be used for recovery by women who have been assaulted.&lt;ref name=DailyNews /&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=EgyptInd2 /&gt; Hotline numbers are passed out on days of major protests. When assaults are reported, requests for help are routed using social media to teams of men and women carrying flares and spare clothing.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=WeN /&gt;  These teams spread out across the square to rescue women as assaults are taking place, particularly during major demonstrations such as the one marking the two-year anniversary of the 2011 revolution on 25 January 2013. Because activists rescuing others are also in danger of assault, OpAntiSH estimates it needs at least 6 groups of 15 volunteers to spread protection across the square.&lt;ref name=EgyptInd2 /&gt;

Volunteers in the rescue squads are trained in an approach that has been developed based on the experience of mob assaults in Tahrir and past rescue efforts led by other individuals and groups in the square. OpAntiSH instructs rescuers to keep calm and avoid the use of force if possible, in order to diffuse mobs involved in the attack and minimize trauma to victims. The teams form a human chain around the woman being attacked, a female volunteer moves in to help clothe the victim, and group works together to bring her to safety.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=Monitor /&gt;&lt;ref name=WeN /&gt;

OpAntiSH believes that women's participation is important in rescue efforts both to engage with harassers and offer support to victims.  “The solution is not just for men to defend us. We, too, have to participate. I believe it’s a women’s fight,” Reem Labib, one of the group's female activists, has said.&lt;ref name=Monitor /&gt;

'''Ottawa Chamberfest''' is a [[music festival]] held by the Ottawa Chamber Music Society in [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]]. It will be held between July 26th and August 9th, 2018 marking the start of its 25th anniversary celebration.

==Artists==
In 1994, the idea of a chamber music festival in Ottawa came to life to remedy the meager availability of live classical music during the summer months and fill the city’s churches with splendid sounds. Ottawa Chamberfest started life as the Ottawa International Chamber Music Festival with 22 concerts in two churches and was an immediate hit. Growing steadily over the years, the 2011 edition of Ottawa Chamberfest presented almost 100 concerts, attracting over 80,000 listeners and is the largest chamber music festival of its kind in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spotlight on Ottawa Chamberfest|url=http://app01.ottawa.ca/ArtsCalendar/feature.jsf;jsessionid=41617FBC70D973F2DC49AB16D391BF87?lang=&amp;eventId=4201|work=Spotlight - Your Guide to What's Happening|publisher=City of Ottawa|accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the Juno award-winning [[Gryphon Trio]] (cellist Roman Borys, violinist Annalee Patipatanakoon and pianist Jamie Parker) are the Artistic Programming Directors for Ottawa Chamberfest.

Among those who performed in the 2011 edition of the festival were [[Jan Lisiecki]], [[Isabel Bayrakdarian]], [[Simone Dinnerstein]], [[Marc-André Hamelin]], Julie Nesrallah, [[Yehonatan Berick]], [[National Arts Centre Orchestra]], [[The Swingle Singers]], [[Nexus (ensemble)]], [[Trio con Brio Copenhagen]], [[New Zealand String Quartet]], TorQ Percussion Quartet and more.

Past performers include Paul Merkelo, Patrick Wedd, Guy Fouquet, Musica Camerata, Stéphane Lemelin, the [[Borodin String Quartet]], the [[Beaux Arts Trio]], the [[Tokyo String Quartet]], [[Martin Beaver]], Penderecki Quartet, [[Paul Stewart (concert pianist)|Paul Stewart]], Martin Chalifour, Monica Whicher,  Jennifer Swartz, and [[Gino Quilico]],Quartango, Neil Gripp, Richard Raymond, the [[St. Lawrence Quartet]], Mayumi Seiler, Keller Quartet, and Adaskin String Trio.

==Music==
Although the concerts are primarily traditional classical music, the scope has evolved to include music by pop and [[jazz]] [[composers]] and also music from non-European countries. The concerts of a typical day would have several different types of music. For Ottawa Chamberfest 2011, performances are divided into several Concert Series.
* Chamber Chat - Lecture series.
* Music at Noon - Music at lunch.
* New Music Now - Show casing new and emerging artists.
* Meet the Artist - Meet several performers up close and personal.
* Bring the Kids - Free shows for children. Interactive and fun.
* 3PM Series - Afternoon shows
* The Siskind Concerts - Nightly shows dedicated to [[Jacob Siskind]], music critic and arts patron.
* Market Soirées - Evening Shows with a focus on an intimate musical experience.
* Alfresco Concerts and Guerilla Gigs - Free outdoor concerts at Rideau Hall and other undisclosed locations.
* Late Night at the Kildare - Hosted by [[Saint Brigid's Church (Ottawa)]], a nightly series featuring a diverse set of performers.
* Festival Gala Series - 3 high profile performances at [[Dominion-Chalmers United Church]].

==Venues==
The concert venues are generally churches or cultural facilities in the heart of downtown [[Ottawa]]. The confirmed venues for Ottawa Chamberfest 2011 are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ottawa Chamberfest Venues|url=http://www.ottawachamberfest.com/visitor-info/venues|work=Ottawa Chamberfest|publisher=Ottawa Chamberfest|accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dominion-Chalmers United Church]]
* [[Rideau Hall]]
* [[Beechwood Cemetery]]
* [[Saint Brigid's Church (Ottawa)]]
* [[Anglican Church of St. John the Evangelist (Ottawa)]]

In previous years the [[University of Ottawa]] was also a regular venue. The Festival has also used, on occasion, Southam Hall in the [[National Arts Centre]] for special gala concerts.

==Other activities==
Apart from the annual summer festival, which is the Ottawa Chamber Music Society's major event, the Society also organizes activities throughout the year. The Concert Series takes place from fall to spring offering approximately six concerts per season. There is also the Family Music Fair - a free day of musical activities for all to enjoy. An annual online auction raises money for the Society's operations.

A '''paper organization''' is any group which exists more in theory than reality.  The term "paper organization" is used in two different contexts, that of the [[military]] and that of the [[labor movement]].

==Military==
For the military, a unit which is not combat-ready due to a planned or unplanned lack of men or basic equipment, but which remains in existence on the books, is called a "paper organization." Such a rating of an organization is a regular part of the planning process and the term is not pejorative.

==Political==
In the [[trade union]] and [[Political radicalism|radical]] political movements, a "paper organization" is a group ostensibly in existence for a specific purpose, but which remains a phantom. For example, a single individual might claim to represent a non-existing local unit of a national organization in attempt to gain admission as a delegate and thus help "pack" a national convention in favor of a particular [[Political faction|faction]]. Such a phantom unit would be called a "paper organization." Alternatively, the term can be used with regards to a [[single-interest group]] with an impressive name but no greater existence than a [[letterhead]] and a mailing address, and no concrete existence in fact. Some so-called Communist [[front group]]s were an example of this latter form of "paper organization."

{{Barack Obama sidebar}}
The '''second inauguration of Barack Obama''' as [[President of the United States]], marked the commencement of the second term of [[Barack Obama]] as President and [[Joe Biden]] as [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. A private swearing-in ceremony took place on Sunday, January 20, 2013 in the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]] of the [[White House]]. A public [[United States presidential inauguration|inauguration ceremony]] took place on Monday, January 21, 2013, at the [[United States Capitol]] building.

The inauguration theme was "Faith in America's Future", a phrase that draws upon the 150th anniversary of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and the completion of the [[United States Capitol dome|Capitol dome]] in 1863. The theme also stressed the "perseverance and unity" of the United States and echoed the "Forward" theme used in the closing months of [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2012|Obama's reelection campaign]]. The inaugural events held in Washington,&amp;nbsp;D.C. from January 19 to 21, 2013 included concerts, a national day of community service on [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day|Martin&amp;nbsp;Luther King,&amp;nbsp;Jr. Day]], the swearing-in ceremony, luncheon and parade, inaugural balls, and the interfaith [[Prayers at United States presidential inaugurations|inaugural prayer service]]. The [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|presidential oath]] was administered to Obama during his swearing-in ceremony on January 20 and 21, 2013 by [[Chief Justice of the United States]] [[John Roberts|John G. Roberts]].

In his second inauguration address, Obama proclaimed that "while freedom is a gift from God, it must be secured by His people here on Earth". He called for laws to [[Climate change mitigation|combat]] [[Climate change in the United States|climate change]], [[History of laws concerning immigration and naturalization in the United States|enactment]] of [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]] [[immigration reform|reform]] and [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]]. Obama stated that more progress was needed on human rights and civil rights (including [[Minority rights|racial minority rights]], [[women's rights]], and [[LGBT rights]]). He vowed to promote democracy abroad and stated that the United States must "be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice" around the world. Additionally, the president vowed to keep existing alliances strong, emphasized the economic recovery and the end of wars, and stated that "no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation". During the speech, Obama linked the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] and [[Stonewall riots]].

Approximately one million people attended the inauguration, and millions more watched from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/01/22/by-the-numbers-more-than-1-million-attend-obamas-second-inauguration/|title=By the numbers: More than 1 million attend Obama's second inauguration|date=22 January 2013|accessdate=22 February 2013|newspaper=MSNBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning==

[[File:Barack Obama before 2013 inauguration.jpg|thumb|left|Obama arriving at his second inauguration]]
The inauguration was planned primarily by two committees: the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies]] and the 2013&amp;nbsp;Presidential Inaugural Committee. The committee began construction of the inaugural platform on September 20, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://leanforward.msnbc.com/_news/2012/09/20/13991501-construction-begins-on-2013-presidential-inauguration-platform?lite |title=Construction begins on 2013 presidential inauguration platform |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=January 21, 2013 |date=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joint Congressional committee===
The swearing-in ceremony and the inaugural luncheon for [[President of the United States|President]] Obama and Vice President Biden were planned by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, a committee composed of [[United States Senator]]s [[Chuck Schumer|Charles Schumer]] of New York, committee chair, [[Lamar Alexander]] of [[Tennessee]] and [[Harry Reid]] of [[Nevada]], and [[United States Representative]]s [[John Boehner]] of [[Ohio]], [[Eric Cantor]] of [[Virginia]] and [[Nancy Pelosi]] of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inaugural.senate.gov/about/committee|title=Membership of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|accessdate=January 21, 2013|publisher=[[United States Senate]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116025523/http://www.inaugural.senate.gov/about/committee|archivedate=November 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee is overseen by the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration|U.S.&amp;nbsp;Senate Committee on Rules and Administration]].

On January 7, 2013, [[Louie Giglio]] was selected to deliver the benediction at the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Boorstein |first=Michelle |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/inauguration/medgar-evers-widow-to-deliver-invocation-at-obama-inauguration/2013/01/07/293904e2-592e-11e2-88d0-c4cf65c3ad15_print.html |title=Widow of Medgar Evers to deliver invocation at Obama inauguration |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=January 7, 2013 |accessdate=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giglio at first accepted, but then withdrew in response to a controversy over a mid-1990s sermon "in which he called on Christians to fight the "aggressive agenda" of the [[gay-rights]] movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stolberg |first=Sheryl Gay |title=Minister Pulls Out of Inauguration After Outcry |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/us/politics/minister-withdraws-from-inaugural-program-after-controversy-over-comments-on-gay-rights.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The substitution of Rev. Luis Leon, pastor of [[St. John's Episcopal Church, Lafayette Square (Washington, D.C.)|Saint John's Church]] near the White House, was announced on January 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Grossman |first=Cathy Lynn |title=Episcopal pastor named to bless Obama inauguration |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/01/15/obama-inauguration-prayer-gays/1837949/ |accessdate=January 16, 2013 |newspaper=USA Today |date=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Myrlie Evers-Williams]], widow of civil rights activist [[Medgar Evers]] delivered the invocation.

On January 8, 2013, [[Richard Blanco]] was named the inaugural poet for [[Barack Obama]]'s second inauguration, the fifth person to play that role. He is the first immigrant, first Latino, first gay person, and the youngest to be inaugural poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Richard Blanco Will Be First Latino Inaugural Poet |url=https://www.npr.org/2013/01/09/168899347/richard-blanco-will-be-first-latino-inaugural-poet |accessdate=January 9, 2013 |newspaper=NPR |date=January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential Inaugural Committee===
The 2013&amp;nbsp;Presidential Inaugural Committee organized several other inauguration-related events at the direction of the President and Vice President of the United States, such as the concerts, parade, balls and prayer service. The co-chairs of the committee were former Presidents [[Jimmy Carter]], [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Bill Clinton]], and [[George W. Bush]], along with Ambassador [[Matthew Barzun]], [[Eva Longoria]], [[Jane Stetson]] and Frank White.&lt;ref name="cochairs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.2013pic.org/about/co-chairs |title=Inaugural Co-Chairs |publisher=2013 Presidential Inaugural Committee |accessdate=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other positions were held by [[Jim Messina (political staffer)|Jim Messina]], who oversaw the Inaugural parade, [[Stephanie Cutter]], Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, [[Julianna Smoot]], Rufus Gifford and [[Patrick Gaspard]].&lt;ref name="cochairs"/&gt;

===Official swearing-in ceremonies===
[[File:President Obama takes the Oath of Office (HD).ogv|thumb|President Barack Obama being sworn in by the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court John Roberts, and accompanied by his family in an official, private ceremony at the White House.]]
Since 1937, the 4-year term of the President and Vice President have ended and begun at noon on January 20, as prescribed by the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. Because January 20, 2013, fell on a Sunday, both Obama and Biden were officially sworn in privately, and then again the following day in a public ceremony. This was the seventh time since the start of [[James Monroe]]'s second term in office, in 1821, that the oath of office was officially administered in a Sunday private ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why is the 2013 Inaugural Ceremonies on January 21?|url=http://www.inaugural.senate.gov/docs/doc-011713-press-guide.pdf|work=The 57th Presidential Inaugural Ceremonies: Guide for producers and correspondents to the inaugural ceremonies and Capitol Hill events|publisher=Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.|pages=22–23 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] administered the oath of office to the President on January 20 in the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]] at the White House.

Obama, who "largely eschewed foreign policy except to recommend engagement over war, and instead focused on addressing poverty and injustice at home",&lt;ref name="NYTBaker20130121" /&gt; delved in broad strokes into the United States past and its future as he called on ordinary Americans to "shape the debates of our time."&lt;ref name="WPSSullivan20120121" /&gt; Rejecting the belief that in America "freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few"&lt;ref name="NYTStevenson20130121"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stevenson|first=Richard W.|title=Speech Reveals an Evolved and Unapologetic President|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/us/politics/obamas-speech-is-urgent-call-for-progressive-values.html?_r=0|accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arguing that "preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action"&lt;ref name="NYTBaker20130121"&gt;{{cite news|last=Baker|first=Peter|title=Obama Offers Liberal Vision: 'We Must Act'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/us/politics/obama-inauguration-draws-hundreds-of-thousands.html?ref=politics&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama said "now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay.

We must act."&lt;ref name="NYTBaker20130121" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTStevenson20130121"/&gt;

Barack Obama used the opening words of the [[U.S. Constitution]]'s preamble "[[Preamble to the United States Constitution|We, the people]]" to suggest how to reconcile America's founding truths and the current discord and dysfunction of its embittered political system.&lt;ref name="APTA20130122" /&gt; He also referenced America's Declaration of Independence stating that our inalienable rights, such as [[Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness]], may be self-evident, but never have been self-executing.&lt;ref name="WPSWilson20130121" /&gt; Obama again invoked the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] by telling his audience: "What makes us exceptional, what makes us America, is our allegiance to an idea articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."&lt;ref name="WPFahrenthold20130122"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fahrenthold|first=David A.|title=President Obama takes second oath of office at inauguration|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/president-obama-takes-second-oath-of-office-at-inauguration/2013/01/21/062d9d54-63d4-11e2-85f5-a8a9228e55e7_story.html|accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama went on, saying "[[All men are created equal|all of us are created equal]]" and that the shared equality of the American people guided the United States "through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall"—linking the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] and [[Stonewall riots]] as key moments in [[women's rights|women's rights activism]], the [[civil rights movement]], and the  [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights movement]] in the United States together.&lt;ref name="NYTBaker20130121" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WPSWilson20130121" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Obama Sketches a Firmly Progressive Agenda"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/us/politics/obama-inauguration-draws-hundreds-of-thousands.html?_r=0|title=Obama Sketches a Firmly Progressive Agenda|last=Shear|first=Michael D.|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 22, 2013|date=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WPKTumulty20130121" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNBasu20130121"&gt;{{cite news|last=Basu|first=Monica|title=Obama embraces key social justice movements in inaugural address|url=http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2013/01/21/obama-embraces-key-social-justice-movements-in-inaugural-address/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=January 24, 2013|date=January 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional words indicated a commitment to [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]]: "Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law—for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well." These words made Obama the first president to use the word ''gay'' as a reference to sexual orientation in an inaugural address.&lt;ref name="NYTBaker20130121" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WPKTumulty20130121"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tumulty|first=Karen|title=Obama invokes gay rights in inaugural address|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-invokes-gay-rights-in-inaugural-address/2013/01/21/78bbc410-6409-11e2-b84d-21c7b65985ee_story.html|accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes20130121"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lauter|first=David|title=Inauguration 2013: Obama addresses gays, compromise, climate change|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-obama-inauguration-2013-20130121,0,2839915,full.story|accessdate=January 23, 2013|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts interpreted his statement as a reaffirmation of President Obama's previously stated support for [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pilkington|first=Ed|title=Obama namechecks Stonewall in historic inaugural address for gay right|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/21/obama-stonewall-inaugural-address-gay-rights |accessdate=January 23, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=January 21, 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others noted that all nine justices of the Supreme Court were seated nearby when Obama linked gay and lesbian rights to two other groups whom the court [[Protected class|treats with special consideration]]: women and racial minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eleveld|first=Kerry|title=Obama Pitched Gay Marriage to the Justices—Without Setting Foot in Court|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/01/obama-pitched-gay-marriage-to-the-justices-without-setting-foot-in-court/267438/|accessdate=January 24, 2013|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Obama also spoke firmly about [[climate change]], [[immigration reform]], and [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]], and argued that they represented important issues for this generation to solve.&lt;ref name="WPSWilson20130121"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Scott|title=Obama brings more optimism, partisanship and populism to second inaugural speech|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-brings-more-optimism-partisanship-and-populism-to-second-inaugural-speech/2013/01/21/ad3a04ec-4d0f-11e2-950a-7863a013264b_story.html|accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that "none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms"&lt;ref name="WP20130121DAFDV" /&gt; Obama stated that his administration "will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations."&lt;ref name="WPSSullivan20120121" /&gt; He also argued that America must lead in this area: "The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult. But America cannot resist this transition; we must lead it. We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries - we must claim its promise."&lt;ref name="APMS20130122"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama inaugural speech defends liberal goals|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130122p2g00m0in008000c.html|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Mainichi Shimbun|accessdate=January 23, 2013|date=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "That is how we will preserve our planet, commanded to our care by God."&lt;ref name="LATimes20130121" /&gt;

Obama commented on the role of government that "Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time — but it does require us to act in our time."&lt;ref name="WPLRein20130121" /&gt; And he added while the American people never gave up their skepticism of a strong federal government, they also never believed that the government can fix all ills.&lt;ref name="WPLRein20130121"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rein|first=Lisa|title=The inaugural speech and the role of government|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/01/21/the-inaugural-speech-and-the-role-of-government/|accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prepare America for a rapidly changing world U.S. President Barack Obama stressed the need for the political leaders of America to act in common cause. The president argued that "now decisions are upon us and we cannot afford delay."&lt;ref name="WPSWilson20130121" /&gt; Obama also made what appeared to be an oblique reference to the partisan battles between himself, the Republican-controlled House and the Senate - where Democrats have control but do not have a [[filibuster]]-proof majority. In reference to the unalienable rights of [[Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness]] Obama declared in the context of the partisan battles that "[b]eing true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life; it does not mean we will all define liberty in exactly the same way, or follow the same precise path to happiness."&lt;ref name="CNNBashStewart20130122" /&gt; Obama said that the politically gridlocked capital — and, implicitly, the Republicans who have fought his ideas during the [[2012 U.S. Presidential election]]&lt;ref name="CNNBashStewart20130122" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cillizza|first=Chris|title=The President liberals were waiting for is (finally) here|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/01/21/the-president-liberals-were-waiting-for-is-finally-here/|accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Balz|first=Dan|title=Obama speech reveals a different leader|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-speech-reveals-a-different-leader/2013/01/21/273bb698-63d4-11e2-85f5-a8a9228e55e7_story.html|accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; — was moving too slowly at a critical moment. "We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate," Obama said. "We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect."&lt;ref name="WP20130121DAFDV"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama calls for greater equality for all|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/inauguration/2013-inauguration-waiting-watching-bearing-witness/2013/01/21/7bc849ce-63b6-11e2-b84d-21c7b65985ee_story.html|accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 21, 2012|author=David A.

The president also addressed the issue of [[wealth inequality in the United States]] noting that America "cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well, and a growing many barely make it."&lt;ref name="WPSWilson20130121" /&gt; "We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else, because she is an American, she is free, and she is equal, not just in the eyes of God but also in our own," he declared.&lt;ref name="LATimes20130121" /&gt; Obama spoke of the need to reduce [[Health care in the United States|America's health care costs]] and [[United States public debt|America's deficit]], but he repudiated that America must choose between "caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crowds celebrate second Obama inauguration|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2013/01/2013121233739127569.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=January 23, 2013|date=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The commitments we make to each other — through [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] — these things do not sap our initiative; they strengthen us," Obama said. "They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great."&lt;ref name="NYTStevenson20130121" /&gt;

While praising U.S. Armed Forces members for their bravery and strength, Obama asserted that "enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war."&lt;ref name="NYTStevenson20130121" /&gt; This statement was made in the foreign policy section of his inaugural address in which Obama promised diplomacy of engagement backed with military steel, but he did not dwell on specific crises like [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran]].&lt;ref name="APTA20130122"&gt;{{cite news|title=Barack Obama sworn in as President in public inauguration|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/barack-obama-to-be-sworn-in-as-president-in-public-inauguration-speech/story-e6frg6n6-1226558549986|agency=Associated Press|publisher=The Australian|accessdate=January 23, 2013|date=January 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully - not because we are naive about the dangers we face, but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear."&lt;ref name="APTA20130122" /&gt; He also declared the United States "must be a source of hope for the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice..." and stand for "human dignity and justice."&lt;ref name="CNNGhitis20130122"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ghitis|first=Frida|title=World to Obama: You can't ignore us|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/22/opinion/ghitis-obama-world/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=January 24, 2013|date=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barack Obama also challenged those who favor aggressive use of the powerful U.S. military, calling them to remember the policies of presidents past. "We are also heirs to those who won the peace and not just the war, who turned sworn enemies into the surest of friends, and we must carry those lessons into this time as well," said Obama.&lt;ref name="APMS20130122" /&gt; Obama vowed America "will remain the anchor of strong alliances" and it will support democracy around the world.&lt;ref name="CNNGhitis20130122" /&gt;

The inaugural address made at several points references to famous speeches of America's former leaders. Barack Obama referenced Martin Luther King's [[I Have a Dream]] speech by noting that "we cannot walk alone."&lt;ref name="Schlesinger20130123"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schlesinger|first=Robert|title=Obama's Second Inaugural Was a Shot Across the Tea Party Bow|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/robert-schlesinger/2013/01/21/obamas-second-inaugural-was-a-shot-across-the-tea-party-bow|accessdate=January 23, 2013|newspaper=US News and World Report|date=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama also made several references to past presidential inaugurations. He referenced the country's [[American Civil War|civil war]] experience and [[Slavery in the United States|its slavery history]] with allusions to phrases used by Abraham Lincoln: "Through blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword, we learned that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|half-slave and half-free]]."&lt;ref name="Schlesinger20130123"/&gt; This was an allusion to "until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword" from Abraham Lincoln's [[Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inauguration address]].&lt;ref name="Schlesinger20130123" /&gt; The [[Inaugural address of John F. Kennedy]] was also referenced. Obama's "this generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience" and later description of "brave men and women in uniform, tempered by the flames of battle" was an allusion to Kennedy's line of a "new generation of Americans—born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace."&lt;ref name="Schlesinger20130123" /&gt; Obama's assertion that America is willing to negotiate with its adversaries "not because we are naïve about the dangers we face, but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear" was reminiscent of Kennedy's words that "civility is not a sign of weakness … Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate."&lt;ref name="Schlesinger20130123" /&gt;

Barack Obama described the American state of affairs with references to the wars in [[w:War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[w:Iraq War|Iraq]] as well as the [[2007–2009 recession in the United States]] as follows: "This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience. A decade of war is now ending. An economic recovery has begun. America's possibilities are limitless."&lt;ref name="BBC20130122" /&gt; Obama then added a collective call to action: "My fellow Americans, we are made for this moment, and we will seize it - so long as we seize it together."&lt;ref name="BBC20130122" /&gt; Noting that "Decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay" Obama stressed the need of shielding the weak, the poor and those lacking health care and demanded equality for all races and gay rights, and [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|security from gun crime for children]].&lt;ref name="APTA20130122" /&gt; In the ''[[Washington Post]]'', [[Chris Cillizza]] stated in this context that Obama's overall inaugural message was "That we are all in this together and that we will ultimately be judged by how we treat the lowest among us." Cillizza pointed to five sentences of Obama's speech which contained not only Obama's agenda for his second term but also "outlined what he wanted his second term to be—and to mean":&lt;ref name="WPCillizza20130121"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cillizza|first=Chris|title=The most important paragraph of President Obama's second inaugural address |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/01/21/the-most-important-paragraph-of-president-obamas-second-inaugural-address/ |accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-ceremony traditions===
At the conclusion of his inaugural address, Obama walked back into the Capitol building, then turned for a moment to look out at the [[National Mall]], filled with hundreds of thousands of flag-waving Americans. He said to those close to him: "I want to take a look one more time. I'm not going to see this again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith |first1=Matt |last2=Cohen |first2=Tom |title=Sworn in again, Obama lingers for last look|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/21/politics/obama-inauguration/index.html|accessdate=January 24, 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, he signed the Capitol's guest book.

Then, in the President's Room of the U.S. Capitol, with the bipartisan congressional leadership looking on, Obama signed documents submitting the nominations of his nominees for several Cabinet posts, the secretaries of State, Defense and Treasury and the head of the CIA.&lt;ref name="LATimes20130121" /&gt;

====Luncheon====
Obama then dined on bison and lobster with select members of Congress and guests in the Capitol's [[National Statuary Hall]] before returning to the White House in the inaugural parade.&lt;ref name="APTA20130122" /&gt;

In a departure from the number of evening balls for the first Obama inauguration, only two official inaugural balls were held to on January 21 celebrate the second inauguration. President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama attended the Commander-In-Chief's Ball held for members of the U.S. military and attended the Inaugural Ball, an invitation-only public gala held as a unified celebration for all Americans.

On January 22, a private staff-only inaugural ball was held for White House aides and administration staff, [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2012|Obama for America]] campaign staff, and the Inaugural Committee staff, was held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, a tradition started by the President and First Lady during the 2009 inauguration to express thanks for the work of the staff. [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Tony Bennett]] provided entertainment for the group.&lt;ref name=staffball&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama Honors Aides, Campaign Staff at Final Inaugural Ball|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/22/obama-staff-ball_n_2530480.html|work=The Huffington Post|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=16 August 2013|date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Obama and the First Lady Michelle Obama led the group in the chant, "fired up, ready to go" that was carried over from the 2008 and 2012 election campaigns. President Obama expressed gratitude and honored the aides and campaign staff for their work, telling the group that "'it makes [him] know that America's future is in good hands' ... 'as long as all of you understand the immense and incredible power that you possess when you work together, when you join voices.'"&lt;ref name=staffball/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Estes|first=Adam Clark|title=Obama's staff-only inaugural ball sounds like the best inaugural ball|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/01/obamas-staff-only-inaugural-ball-sounds-best-inaugural-ball/61301/|work=[[The Atlantic#The Atlantic Wire|The Atlantic Wire]]|publisher=22 January 2013|accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NBC5Chicago&gt;{{cite web|last=Lutz|first=B.J.|title=Inaugural Ball Benefits Staffer Who Died During Campaign|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/obama-inauguration-2013-staff-ball-alex-okrent--187985291.html|publisher=[[WMAQ-TV]] ([[Chicago, Illinois]])|accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the staff inaugural ball, President Obama also paid tribute to Alex Okrent, a 29-year-old campaign staffer who died after collapsing at the 2012 Obama campaign headquarters in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]. Proceeds from ticket sales for the staff inaugural ball, where tickets  sold at $10.00 apiece, were used to support a memorial fund for Okrent.&lt;ref name=staffball/&gt;&lt;ref name=NBC5Chicago/&gt;

====National prayer service====
[[File:2013 National Prayer Service.JPG|right|thumb|President Obama and Vice President Biden and their wives in the front pew at the Washington National Cathedral on January 22, 2013]]

President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, gathered at the Washington National Cathedral on January 22, 2013, for a national day of prayer.&lt;ref name=washcathdl&gt;{{cite web|title=The 57th Presidential Inaugural Prayer Service|url=http://www.nationalcathedral.org/events/PresPrayer20130122.shtml#.Ug2pJ9LVBkk|publisher=[[Washington National Cathedral]]|accessdate=16 August 2013|date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prayer service was attended by dignitaries and guests of diverse faiths for a day of prayers, readings, and musical performances. As in the case of the prayer service for the 2009 inauguration, the theme of the interfaith worship service reflected inclusiveness and religious diversity, ranging from a mix of Protestant pastors, female Rabbi, Hindu, and Muslim religious leaders to Catholic and Episcopal bishops. Featured speakers at the prayer service included religious leaders from the National African American Clergy Network, Islamic Society of North America, in addition to the Metropolitan Community Churches that served as a spiritual refuge and place of worship for gay Christians.&lt;ref name=washcathdl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kerr|first=Jennifer C.|title=Obamas, Bidens Attend Washington National Cathedral Prayer Service|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/22/obamas-bidens-attend-wash_n_2526099.html|work=The Huffington Post|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=16 August 2013|date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Banks|first=Adelle M.|title=Preachers pray for unity at National Cathedral inaugural service|url=http://www.religionnews.com/2013/01/22/preachers-pray-for-unity-at-national-cathedral-inaugural-service/|publisher=Religious News Service|accessdate=16 August 2013|date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction to inaugural address==
{{see also|International reactions to the United States presidential election, 2012}}
The loudest response from the audience at the National Mall coincided with Obama's remarks supporting [[Male–female income disparity in the United States|equal pay for women]] and [[LGBT social movements|equal treatment for sexual minorities]], when he stated that America's journey to equality is incomplete "until our wives, our mothers, and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts," and "until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law."&lt;ref name="CNNBasu20130121" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sworn in again, Obama lingers for last look|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/21/politics/obama-inauguration/index.html?hpt=po_c2|publisher=CNN|accessdate=24 January 2013|author=Matt Smith and Tom Cohen|date=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Obama "made history" said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin when Obama connected the struggle of gay couple to the equal rights movement writ large. "By lifting up the lives of LGBT families for the very first time in an inaugural address, President Obama sent a clear message to LGBT young people from the Gulf Coast to the Rocky Mountains that this country's leaders will fight for them until equality is the law of the land," Griffin said in a release.&lt;ref name="USNMetzler20130122"&gt;{{cite news|last=Metzler|first=Rebekah|title=Gay-Marriage Supporters See President Obama's Inaugural Address as 'Clarion Call'|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/01/22/gay-marriage-supporters-see-president-obamas-inaugural-address-as-clarion-call?s_cid=related-links:TOP|accessdate=25 January 2013|newspaper=US News and World Report|date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was however rejected by Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, which has led campaigns against legalizing same-sex marriage. Brown said gay couples are "already treated equally under the law."&lt;ref name="USNMetzler20130122" /&gt; "They have the same civil rights as anyone else; they have the right to live as they wish and love whom they choose," he said in a release. "What they don't have is the right to redefine marriage for all of society."&lt;ref name="USNMetzler20130122" /&gt;

Obama's second inaugural speech was regarded as laying out a broad liberal or progressive agenda, supporting gay rights and climate change reform.&lt;ref&gt;

Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] and the [[Great Society]].&lt;ref name="Gergen20130122" /&gt; And Brian Balogh, a professor of history at the [[University of Virginia]]'s Miller Center, added that Obama's second inaugural address mattered in comparison to previous second inaugural speeches "because future historians will mark it as the moment that Obama explained why he is a progressive. The programs that Obama called for were characteristically liberal: reaffirming the social safety net, equal pay for women, etc. Nothing new here -- just the Obama classic. What differed this time, and what this moment was made for (to twist the president's own words) was articulating the progressive rationale for these programmatic ends. "Preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action," Obama proudly told the nation."&lt;ref name="CNNOBLiberalDefense20130121" /&gt; The ''Washington Post'''s Zachary A. Goldfarb, who covers economic policy and the White House for the Post, rejected the notion that Obama's speech was liberal. He wrote: "Obama did not advance a liberal agenda. A consequential one, certainly, but one that reflects centrist views or center-left ones at most. The agenda seems liberal only when judged against the liberal-conservative divide we're used to in Washington. [...] Obama's inaugural speech sounded liberal because he offered the kind of robust defense of government's role in the nation's life that has seldom been heard from Democratic politicians after President [[Bill Clinton]] declared in 1996 that "the era of big government is over.""&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldfarb|first=Zachary A.|title=Obama's daring liberal agenda is neither daring nor liberal.

Republican congressional leaders had a muted, bipartisan response to Obama's second inaugural address and expressed their hope for cooperation between their party and Obama. "There are plenty of areas of disagreement but there are also some things that, fundamentally, we agree on -- and that is this country is one of opportunity," House Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] said.&lt;ref name="CNNBashStewart20130122" /&gt; He added that there were partisan differences over "the way we get there to help everybody. ... Hopefully, we can bridge those differences."&lt;ref name="CNNBashStewart20130122"&gt;{{cite news|title=Republicans pause on partisanship: 'A day we can all come together'|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/21/politics/obama-inauguration-gop-reacts/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=27 January 2013|author=Dana Bash and Martina Stewart|date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor however warned, that, if Obama follows what Cantor called a liberal agenda, then that agenda  it's not designed to bring Republicans and the president together.&lt;ref name="WPSonmezKeefe20130122" /&gt; Senate Minority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]] stated in a written statement that every four years on Inaugural Day America shows the world that its major political parties can disagree with civility and mutual respect. McConnell wrote that Obama's speech was a "fresh start" to address the issue of federal spending and debt: "Republicans are eager to work with the president on achieving this common goal and we firmly believe that divided government provides the perfect opportunity to do so. Together, there is much we can achieve."&lt;ref name="CNNBashStewart20130122" /&gt; He also praised Obama's speech as "a really good speech. People can criticize President Obama about a lot of things. But not his ability to communicate. I think he communicated to the American people a message of hope, a message of action and I liked it very much."&lt;ref name="WPSonmezKeefe20130122" /&gt;

Other Republicans were critical of Obama. House Budget Committee Chairman [[Paul Ryan]] said Obama mischaracterized Republicans' position on federal entitlement programs. "No one is suggesting that what we call our earned entitlements – entitlements you pay for, like payroll taxes for Medicare and Social Security – are putting you in a 'taker' category."&lt;ref name="WPSonmezKeefe20130122"&gt;{{cite news|title=Paul Ryan, congressional Republicans slam Obama's second inaugural address|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/01/22/paul-ryan-congressional-republicans-slam-obamas-second-inaugural-address/|accessdate=27 January 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=22 January 2013|author=Felicia Sonmez and Ed O'Keefe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan contended that Obama made a "switcheroo" in his speech by suggesting that Republicans have referred to beneficiaries of those programs as "takers." In reality, he said, that term refers to recipients of welfare and other non-"earned" entitlements.&lt;ref name="WPSonmezKeefe20130122" /&gt; U.S. Senator Mike Lee, a frequent Obama critic, expressed his opinion that Obama chose not to unite the country, but to divide the American people. "This is not the approach of a leader attempting to find solutions to problems but rather the tactics of a partisan trying to pick political fights. His vision for the next four years is clear: defend a broken system, ignore the fiscal crisis, and drive future generations further into debt."&lt;ref name="WPSonmezKeefe20130122" /&gt; Other Republicans like John McCain ("I didn't hear any conciliatory remarks")&lt;ref name="Benen20130122" /&gt; and "pundits from the D.C. establishment"&lt;ref name="Benen20130122"&gt;{{cite web|last=Benen|first=Steve|title=I didn't hear any conciliatory remarks|url=http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/01/22/16643164-the-discomfort-with-an-unapologetic-president?lite|work=The Maddow Blog|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=27 January 2013|date=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; also complained about Obama's speech.&lt;ref name="Benen20130122" /&gt; ''The Washington Post''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Dana Milbank, for example, wrote that Obama's address "was less an inaugural address for the ages than a leftover campaign speech combined with an early draft of the State of the Union address."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Milbank|first=Dana|title=Preaching to the choir|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-preaching-to-the-choir/2013/01/21/f37223a8-6421-11e2-85f5-a8a9228e55e7_story.html|accessdate=27 January 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Professor of history and public affairs at [[Princeton University]] Julian Zelizer called the speech a "powerful oration for a contentious moment in national politics",&lt;ref name="CNNOBLiberalDefense20130121"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama's ringing defense of liberalism|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/21/opinion/opinion-inauguration-roundup/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=24 January 2013|date=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgetown University]] professor Donna Brazile called it "a deeply moving and patriotic speech" and "one of the most effective usages of the founding documents' principles as a supporting narrative -- drawing us from the past to the present to the future" by "a president sharing with the nation his values most personal and vision most spiritual."&lt;ref name="CNNOBLiberalDefense20130121" /&gt; [[Oxford University]] historian Timothy Stanley wrote that Obama, compared to "one of those "bring us together", delivered "a more policy specific speech that reflected the difficult, partisan reality of 2013."&lt;ref name="CNNOBLiberalDefense20130121" /&gt; Obama's moral commitment to gay rights - expressed in the words "for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well" was "controversial but admirably courageous."&lt;ref name="CNNOBLiberalDefense20130121" /&gt; For Maria Cardona, a former senior adviser to [[Hillary Clinton]], "Obama's message is still one of hope and change. [...] He gave his supporters hope he will continue to fight for them. He gave all Americans the assurance the country will continue to change for the better."&lt;ref name="CNNOBLiberalDefense20130121" /&gt;

Senior political columnist for ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' John Avlon lauded Obama for "an audacious speech to the extent that Obama sought to reclaim politicized concepts like [[American exceptionalism]] from their conservative contexts, making the case that the combination of diversity and opportunity makes the American Dream possible for each new generation."&lt;ref name="CNNOBLiberalDefense20130121" /&gt; But Avlon also criticed Obama writing that "the scope of the speech was sprawling and dotted with policy references more suited to a State of the Union address. It was not tightly framed or focused on a single concept, nor was there a single clear phrase that summed up the speech, at least at first listen."&lt;ref name="CNNOBLiberalDefense20130121" /&gt;

President [[Jimmy Carter]] former deputy chief speechwriter Gordon Stewart wrote that Obama's "magnificent" second inaugural  address was far better than his [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|first inaugural address]]. Stewart lauded that Obama for emerging "as a leader who has stopped splitting differences and is prepared to make choices and fight for them."&lt;ref name="CNNStewart20130122"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stewart|first=Gordon|title=Obama finally meets Machiavelli|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/21/opinion/stewart-obama-inaugural-speech/index.html?iid=article_sidebar|publisher=CNN|accessdate=24 January 2013|date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stewart both Obama's supporters and opponents have a clearer idea what Obama will do in his second term.&lt;ref name="CNNStewart20130122" /&gt; Former CNN producer and correspondent Frida Ghitis complained that Obama devoted nearly all his inaugural speech to domestic issues and said that international disengagement isn't an option for American. According to Ghitis the aspirations Obama "expressed for America are the ones he should express for our tumultuous planet."&lt;ref name="CNNGhitis20130122" /&gt; She expressed her hopes that Obama "can remember America's leadership position and devote more attention to those around the world who see it as a source of inspiration and encouragement."&lt;ref name="CNNGhitis20130122" /&gt; After neglecting to mention a single foreign country by name during his address, [[The Economist]] concluded that Obama's "second term will have little emphasis on foreign affairs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The re-inauguration of Barack Obama: Gloves off|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21570712-uncompromising-words-president-who-will-never-have-face-voters-again-gloves|accessdate=28 January 2013|newspaper=The Economist|date=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gergen noticed that Obama stressed equality in the tradition of Abraham Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] and Martin Luther King's "[[I Have a Dream]]". According to Gergen the speech Obama's was "firmest attempt to build upon Lincoln and King - and in effect, his address made him their modern heir."&lt;ref name="Gergen20130122"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gergen|first=David|title=Obama's historic speech deepens divisions|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/23/opinion/gergen-obama-history/index.html?iid=article_sidebar|publisher=CNN|accessdate=24 January 2013|date=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  President Obama's green jobs adviser in 2009, Van Jones, called Obama's speech "offered the best rebuttal to date" since "President [[Ronald Reagan]] launched an era of anti-government politics with his [[First inauguration of Ronald Reagan|first inaugural address]].".&lt;ref name="CNNVanJones20130123"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Van|title=Obama speech: Anti-government era is over |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/22/opinion/jones-obama-speech/index.html?iid=article_sidebar|publisher=CNN|accessdate=24 January 2013|date=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing Reagan and Obama, Van Jones wrote: "Instead of "government is the problem," the president reminded us that we could all fall victim to sudden misfortune. Instead of pinning blame for every social problem on the size of government, the president recognized both individual responsibility and the role of community in giving each child the opportunity to succeed."&lt;ref name="CNNVanJones20130123" /&gt; Van Jones noted both presidents invoked famous places of American history in their inaugural addresses but differed substantially in these places. While Reagan chose places of battles, Obama "tied [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] in with [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma]] and cemented his declaration that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights are civil rights."&lt;ref name="CNNVanJones20130123" /&gt; David Rothkopf, CEO and editor-at-large of the FP Group (publishers of [[Foreign Policy magazine]]), wrote that Obama rightly demanded equal rights for gays and equal pay for women. According to Rothkopf Obama's words sketched an America better than what the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] imagined. Rothkopf wrote: "The great beauty of the speech was not in any particular phrase, but in that the man in question and the country he leads were in so many ways far beyond what the Founders could have imagined. And that, despite our natural tendency to glorify our origins, that this America was in virtually every way better than the one they offered up to us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rothkopf|first=David|title=Obama's America, better than what Founders imagined|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/21/opinion/rothkopf-better-america/index.html |publisher=CNN|accessdate=24 January 2013|date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Shadowlands''''' is a play by [[William Nicholson (writer)|William Nicholson]]. It was first shown as a [[television film]] in 1985, directed by Norman Stone and produced by [[David M. Thompson]] for [[BBC Wales]]. It was later adapted for the stage, premiering on Broadway in 1990 and was nominated for the [[Tony Award for Best Play]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/12/theater/review-theater-shadowlands-cs-lewis-and-his-life-s-love.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shadowlands (1993 film)|A third version]] was released in 1993 as a feature film directed by [[Richard Attenborough]].

The play is about the relationship between [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] [[University don|don]] and author, [[C. S. Lewis]] and the American writer [[Joy Davidman|Joy Gresham]]. It began life as a script entitled ''I Call it Joy'' written for [[Thames Television]] by [[Brian Sibley]] and Norman Stone. Sibley was credited on the BBC film as "consultant" and went on to write the book ''Shadowlands: The True Story of C.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Lewis and Joy Davidman''.

== Synopsis ==
The story follows Lewis as he meets an American fan, [[Joy Davidman|Joy Gresham]], whom he befriends and eventually marries. The story also deals with his struggle with personal pain and grief: Lewis preaches that one should endure suffering with patience, but finds that the simple answers he had preached no longer apply when Joy becomes afflicted with [[cancer]] and eventually dies.

== Production history ==

*'''Television'''
The original television film starred [[Joss Ackland]] as Lewis, with [[Claire Bloom]] as his wife [[Joy Davidman|Joy Gresham]]. It won BAFTA Awards in 1986 for Best Play and Best Actress (Bloom).

*'''Stage'''
It was subsequently adapted for the stage, opening at the Theatre Royal in Plymouth on 5 October 1989 before transferring to the [[Queen's Theatre]] in London on 23 October 1989, running until 8 September 1990. The stage version and subsequent movie gave Joy Davidman only one stepson instead of two. The production was directed by [[Elijah Moshinsky]] and starred [[Nigel Hawthorne]] as Lewis with [[Jane Lapotaire]] as Joy. It won Best Play in the [[Evening Standard Awards]] for 1990. Lapotaire was nominated for the [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress]] for her stage performance.

Hawthorne successfully took the role of Lewis to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], playing at the [[Brooks Atkinson Theatre]] from November 1990 to April 1991 and again directed by Moshinsky. Hawthorne co-starred in New York, with [[Jane Alexander]] as Joy, who was now given her maiden name of [[Joy Davidman]]. Hawthorne won a 1991 Tony award for Best Actor, while Nicholson picked up a nomination for Best Play.

The first major revival of the play, starring [[Charles Dance]] as Lewis and [[Janie Dee]] as Joy, premiered at [[Cambridge Arts Theatre]] on 5 September 2007 before touring the UK. The production, directed by Michael Barker-Carven, transferred to the [[Wyndham's Theatre]] on 3 October 2007 for an eleven-week season before transferring to the [[Novello Theatre]] where it ran from 21 December 2007 to 23 February 2008.

*'''Film'''
In 1993, the play was adapted into a [[Shadowlands (1993 film)|film of the same name]] directed by [[Richard Attenborough]] with a screenplay by Nicholson, co-starring [[Anthony Hopkins]] and [[Debra Winger]], winning Oscar nominations for both Nicholson and Winger.

Quotes
C. S. Lewis as the film concludes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Why love if losing hurts so much? I have no answers any more. Only the life I have lived. Twice in that life I've been given the choice: as a boy and as a man. The boy chose safety, the man chooses suffering. The pain now is part of the happiness then. That's the deal."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Joy in the stage version:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"See yourself in the mirror, you're separate from yourself. See the world in the mirror, you're separate from the world. I don't want that separation anymore."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''shape of the universe''' is the [[#Local geometry (spatial curvature)|local]] and [[#Global Universe Structure|global geometry]] of the [[universe]]. The local features of the geometry of the universe are primarily described by its [[curvature of Riemannian manifolds|curvature]], whereas the [[spacetime topology|topology]] of the universe describes general global properties of its shape as of a continuous object. The shape of the universe is related to [[general relativity]], which describes how [[spacetime]] is curved and bent by mass and energy.

Cosmologists distinguish between the [[observable universe]] and the global universe. The observable universe consists of the part of the universe that can, in principle, be observed by light reaching Earth within the age of the universe. It encompasses a region of space that [[comoving distance|currently]] forms a ball centered at Earth of estimated radius {{convert|46|e9ly|m}}. This does not mean the universe is 46 billion years old; in fact, the universe [[age of the universe|is believed to be 13.8 billion years old]], but [[metric expansion of space|space itself has also expanded]], causing the [[size of the universe|size of the observable universe]] to be as stated. (However, it is possible to observe these distant areas only in their very distant past, when the distance light had to travel was much less). Assuming an [[isotropy#Physics|isotropic]] nature, the observable universe is similar for all contemporary vantage points.

The global shape of the universe can be described with three attributes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tegmark|first1=Max|title=Our Mathematical Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality|date=2014|publisher=Knopf|isbn=978-0307599803|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Finite or infinite
# Flat (no [[curvature]]), open (negative curvature), or closed (positive curvature)
# [[Connected space|Connectivity]], how the universe is put together, i.e., [[simply connected space]] or multiply connected.
There are certain logical connections among these properties. For example, a universe with positive curvature is necessarily finite.&lt;ref name="Ellis98"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=G. F. R.

The exact shape is still a matter of debate in [[physical cosmology]], but experimental data from various independent sources ([[WMAP]], [[BOOMERanG]], and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] for example) confirm that the observable universe is flat with only a 0.4% margin of error.&lt;ref name="NASA_Shape"&gt;{{cite web |title=Will the Universe expand forever? |url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=24 January 2014 |accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fermi_Flat"&gt;{{cite web |title=Our universe is Flat|

In formal terms, this is a [[3-manifold]] model corresponding to the spatial section (in [[comoving coordinates]]) of the 4-dimensional [[spacetime]] of the universe. The model most theorists currently use is the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker]] (FLRW) model. Arguments have been put forward that the observational data best fit with the conclusion that the shape of the global universe is infinite and flat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Shape of the observable universe==
{{Main|Observable universe}}
{{See also|Distance measures (cosmology)}}

As stated in the introduction, there are two aspects to consider:
# its ''local'' geometry, which predominantly concerns the curvature of the universe, particularly the [[observable universe]], and
# its ''global'' geometry, which concerns the topology of the universe as a whole.
The observable universe can be thought of as a sphere that extends outwards from any observation point for 46.5 billion light years, going farther back in time and more [[redshift]]ed the more distant away one looks. Ideally, one can continue to look back all the way to the [[Big Bang]]; in practice, however, the farthest away one can look using light and other [[electromagnetic radiation]] is the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB), as anything past that was opaque. Experimental investigations show that the observable universe is very close to [[isotropic]] and [[homogeneous]].

If the observable universe encompasses the entire universe, we may be able to determine the structure of the entire universe by observation. However, if the observable universe is smaller than the entire universe, our observations will be limited to only a part of the whole, and we may not be able to determine its global geometry through measurement. From experiments, it is possible to construct different mathematical models of the global geometry of the entire universe all of which are consistent with current observational data and so it is currently unknown whether the observable universe is identical to the global universe or it is instead many orders of magnitude smaller than it. The universe may be small in some dimensions and not in others (analogous to the way a [[cuboid]] is longer in the dimension of length than it is in the dimensions of width and depth). To test whether a given mathematical model describes the universe accurately, scientists look for the model's novel implications—what are some phenomena in the universe that we have not yet observed, but that must exist if the model is correct—and they devise experiments to test whether those phenomena occur or not. For example, if the universe is a small closed loop, one would expect to see multiple images of an object in the sky, although not necessarily images of the same age.

Cosmologists normally work with a given [[space-like]] slice of spacetime called the [[comoving distance|comoving coordinates]], the existence of a preferred set of which is possible and widely accepted in present-day physical cosmology. The section of spacetime that can be observed is the backward [[light cone]] (all points within the [[cosmic light horizon]], given time to reach a given observer), while the related term [[Hubble volume]] can be used to describe either the past light cone or comoving space up to the surface of last scattering. To speak of "the shape of the universe (at a point in time)" is [[ontological]]ly naive from the point of view of [[special relativity]] alone: due to the [[relativity of simultaneity]] we cannot speak of different points in space as being "at the same point in time" nor, therefore, of "the shape of the universe at a point in time". However, the comoving coordinates (if well-defined) provide a strict sense to those by using the time since the Big Bang (measured in the reference of CMB) as a distinguished universal time.

==Curvature of the universe==
{{Main|Curvature#Space}}

The [[curvature of Riemannian manifolds|curvature]] is a quantity describing how the geometry of a space differs locally from the one of the [[Euclidean space|flat space]]. The curvature of any locally [[isotropic space]] (and hence of a locally isotropic universe) falls into one of the three following cases:
# Zero curvature (flat); a drawn triangle's angles add up to 180° and the [[Pythagorean theorem]] holds; such 3-dimensional space is locally modeled by [[Euclidean space]] {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''3''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.
# Positive curvature; a drawn triangle's angles add up to more than 180°; such 3-dimensional space is locally modeled by a region of a [[N-sphere|3-sphere]] {{math|'''S'''&lt;sup&gt;''3''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.
# Negative curvature; a drawn triangle's angles add up to less than 180°; such 3-dimensional space is locally modeled by a region of a [[hyperbolic space]] {{math|'''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''3''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

Curved geometries are in the domain of [[Non-Euclidean geometry]]. An example of a positively curved space would be the surface of a sphere such as the Earth. A triangle drawn from the equator to a pole will have at least two angles equal 90°, which makes the sum of the 3 angles greater than 180°. An example of a negatively curved surface would be the shape of a [[saddle]] or mountain pass. A triangle drawn on a saddle surface will have the sum of the angles adding up to less than 180°.

[[File:End of universe.jpg|thumb|275px|The local geometry of the universe is determined by whether the [[density parameter#Density parameter|density parameter {{math|Ω}}]] is greater than, less than, or equal to 1.&lt;br&gt;
From top to bottom: a [[spherical geometry|spherical universe]] with {{math|Ω &gt; 1}}, a [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic universe]] with {{math|Ω &lt; 1}}, and a [[Euclidean geometry|flat universe]] with {{math|Ω {{=}} 1}}. These depictions of two-dimensional surfaces are merely easily visualizable analogs to the 3-dimensional structure of (local) space.]]

[[General relativity]] explains that mass and energy bend the curvature of spacetime and is used to determine what curvature the universe has by using a value called the [[density parameter]], represented with Omega ({{math|Ω}}). The density parameter is the average density of the universe divided by the critical energy density, that is, the mass energy needed for a universe to be flat. Put another way,
*If {{math|Ω {{=}} 1}}, the universe is flat
*If {{math|Ω &gt; 1}}, there is positive curvature
*if {{math|Ω &lt; 1}} there is negative curvature

One can experimentally calculate this {{math|Ω}} to determine the curvature two ways. One is to count up all the mass-energy in the universe and take its average density then divide that average by the critical energy density. Data from [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) as well as the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck spacecraft]] give values for the three constituents of all the mass-energy in the universe – normal mass ([[baryonic matter]] and [[dark matter]]), relativistic particles ([[photon]]s and [[neutrino]]s), and [[dark energy]] or the [[cosmological constant]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Density Parameter, Omega|url= http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/denpar.html|website= hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu|accessdate= 2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1303.5076 |doi= 10.1051/0004-6361/201321591 |title= Planck2013 results.

Ω&lt;sub&gt;mass&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 0.315±0.018

Ω&lt;sub&gt;relativistic&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 9.24×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;

Another way to measure Ω is to do so geometrically by measuring an angle across the observable universe. We can do this by using the [[CMB]] and measuring the power spectrum and temperature anisotropy. For an intuition, one can imagine finding a gas cloud that is not in thermal equilibrium due to being so large that light speed cannot propagate the thermal information. Knowing this propagation speed, we then know the size of the gas cloud as well as the distance to the gas cloud, we then have two sides of a triangle and can then determine the angles. Using a method similar to this, the [[BOOMERanG experiment]] has determined that the sum of the angles to 180° within experimental error, corresponding to an Ω&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 1.00±0.12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=astro-ph/0004404|bibcode= 2000Natur.404..955D |title= A flat Universe from high-resolution maps of the cosmic microwave background radiation |journal= Nature |volume= 404 |issue= 6781 |pages= 955–9 |author1= De Bernardis |first1= P. |last2= Ade |first2= P.

These and other astronomical measurements constrain the spatial curvature to be very close to zero, although they do not constrain its sign. This means that although the local geometries of spacetime are generated by the theory of relativity based on [[spacetime interval]]s, we can approximate ''3-space'' by the familiar [[Euclidean geometry]].

The [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) model]] using [[Friedmann equations]] is commonly used to model the universe. The FLRW model provides a curvature of the universe based on the mathematics of [[fluid dynamics]], that is, modeling the matter within the universe as a perfect fluid. Although stars and structures of mass can be introduced into an "almost FLRW" model, a strictly FLRW model is used to approximate the local geometry of the observable universe. Another way of saying this is that if all forms of [[dark energy]] are ignored, then the curvature of the universe can be determined by measuring the average density of matter within it, assuming that all matter is evenly distributed (rather than the distortions caused by 'dense' objects such as galaxies). This assumption is justified by the observations that, while the universe is "weakly" [[homogeneity (physics)|inhomogeneous]] and [[anisotropic]] (see the [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]]), it is on average homogeneous and [[isotropic]].

==Global universe structure==
Global structure covers the [[geometry]] and the [[topology]] of the whole universe—both the observable universe and beyond. While the local geometry does not determine the global geometry completely, it does limit the possibilities, particularly a geometry of a constant curvature. The universe is often taken to be a [[geodesic manifold]], free of [[topological defect#Cosmological defects|topological defects]]; relaxing either of these complicates the analysis considerably. A global geometry is a local geometry plus a topology. It follows that a topology alone does not give a global geometry: for instance, Euclidean 3-space and [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic 3-space]] have the same topology but different global geometries.

As stated in the introduction, investigations within the study of the global structure of the universe include:
*Whether the universe is [[infinity|infinite]] or finite in extent
*Whether the geometry of the global universe is flat, positively curved, or negatively curved
*Whether the topology is [[simply connected space|simply connected]] like a sphere or multiply connected, like a torus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Space and time in the modern universe|author= P.C.W.Davies|date= 1977|publisher= cambridge university press|ISBN= 0-521-29151-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infinite or finite===
One of the presently unanswered questions about the universe is whether it is infinite or finite in extent. For intuition, it can be understood that a finite universe has a finite volume that, for example, could be in theory filled up with a finite amount of material, while an infinite universe is unbounded and no numerical volume could possibly fill it. Mathematically, the question of whether the universe is infinite or finite is referred to as [[bounded metric space|boundedness]]. An infinite universe (unbounded metric space) means that there are points ''arbitrarily'' far apart: for any distance {{mvar|d}}, there are points that are of a distance at least {{mvar|d}} apart. A finite universe is a bounded metric space, where there is some distance {{mvar|d}} such that all points are within distance {{mvar|d}} of each other. The smallest such {{mvar|d}} is called the diameter of the universe, in which case the universe has a well-defined "volume" or "scale."

====With or without boundary====
Assuming a finite universe, the universe can either have an edge or no edge. Many finite mathematical spaces, e.g., a [[disk (mathematics)|disc]], have an edge or boundary. Spaces that have an edge are difficult to treat, both conceptually and mathematically. Namely, it is very difficult to state what would happen at the edge of such a universe. For this reason, spaces that have an edge are typically excluded from consideration.

However, there exist many finite spaces, such as the [[3-sphere]] and [[three-torus|3-torus]], which have no edges. Mathematically, these spaces are referred to as being [[compact space|compact]] without boundary. The term compact basically means that it is finite in extent ("bounded") and [[complete metric space|complete]]. The term "without boundary" means that the space has no edges. Moreover, so that calculus can be applied, the universe is typically assumed to be a [[differentiable manifold]]. A mathematical object that possesses all these properties, compact without boundary and differentiable, is termed a [[closed manifold]]. The 3-sphere and 3-torus are both closed manifolds.

===Curvature===
The curvature of the universe places constraints on the topology. If the spatial geometry is [[spherical 3-manifold|spherical]], i.e., possess positive curvature, the topology is compact. For a flat (zero curvature) or a hyperbolic (negative curvature) spatial geometry, the topology can be either compact or infinite.&lt;ref name="Luminet1995"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many textbooks erroneously state that a flat universe implies an infinite universe; however, the correct statement is that a flat universe that is also [[simply connected]] implies an infinite universe.&lt;ref name="Luminet1995"/&gt; For example, Euclidean space is flat, simply connected, and infinite, but the [[torus#Flat torus|torus]] is flat, multiply connected, finite, and compact.

In general, [[Riemannian geometry#Local to global theorems|local to global theorems]] in [[Riemannian geometry]] relate the local geometry to the global geometry. If the local geometry has constant curvature, the global geometry is very constrained, as described in [[geometrization conjecture|Thurston geometries]].

The latest research shows that even the most powerful future experiments (like SKA, Planck..) will not be able to distinguish between flat, open and closed universe if the true value of cosmological curvature parameter is smaller than 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;. If the true value of the cosmological curvature parameter is larger than 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; we will be able to distinguish between these three models even now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=0901.3354|bibcode= 2009MNRAS.397..431V |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14938.x |title= How flat can you get?

===={{anchor|Flat universe}} Universe with zero curvature====
In a universe with zero curvature, the local geometry is [[geometrization conjecture#Euclidean geometry E3|flat]]. The most obvious global structure is that of [[Euclidean space]], which is infinite in extent. Flat universes that are finite in extent include the [[torus]] and [[Klein bottle]]. Moreover, in three dimensions, there are 10 finite closed flat 3-manifolds, of which 6 are orientable and 4 are non-orientable. These are the [[flat manifold|Bieberbach manifolds]]. The most familiar is the aforementioned [[three-torus model of the universe|3-torus universe]].

In the absence of dark energy, a flat universe expands forever but at a continually decelerating rate, with expansion asymptotically approaching zero. With dark energy, the expansion rate of the universe initially slows down, due to the effect of gravity, but eventually increases. The [[ultimate fate of the universe]] is the same as that of an open universe.

A flat universe can have [[zero-energy universe|zero total energy]].

====Universe with positive curvature====
[[File:universecolor.jpg|thumb|right|''Universe in an expanding sphere.'' The galaxies farthest away are moving fastest and hence experience length contraction and so become smaller to an [[History of the Center of the Universe|observer in the centre]].]]
A positively curved universe is described by [[elliptic geometry]], and can be thought of as a three-dimensional [[hypersphere]], or some other [[spherical 3-manifold]] (such as the [[Poincaré dodecahedral space]]), all of which are quotients of the 3-sphere.

[[Homology sphere#Cosmology|Poincaré dodecahedral space]], a positively curved space, colloquially described as "soccerball-shaped", as it is the quotient of the 3-sphere by the [[binary icosahedral group]], which is very close to [[icosahedral symmetry]], the symmetry of a soccer ball. This was proposed by [[Jean-Pierre Luminet]] and colleagues in 2003&lt;ref name="Nat03"&gt;{{cite journal

====Universe with negative curvature====
A hyperbolic universe, one of a negative spatial curvature, is described by [[hyperbolic geometry]], and can be thought of locally as a three-dimensional analog of an infinitely extended saddle shape. There are a great variety of [[hyperbolic 3-manifold]]s, and their classification is not completely understood. Those of finite volume can be understood via the [[Mostow rigidity theorem]]. For hyperbolic local geometry, many of the possible three-dimensional spaces are informally called "horn topologies", so called because of the shape of the [[pseudosphere]], a canonical model of hyperbolic geometry. An example is the [[Picard horn]], a negatively curved space, colloquially described as "funnel-shaped".&lt;ref name="Aurich0403597"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Aurich |first= Ralf|author2=Lustig, S. |author3=Steiner, F. |author4=Then, H. |title= Hyperbolic Universes with a Horned Topology and the CMB Anisotropy |journal= [[Classical and Quantum Gravity]] |volume= 21 |issue= 21 |pages= 4901–4926 |date= 2004 |doi= 10.1088/0264-9381/21/21/010 |bibcode= 2004CQGra..21.4901A |arxiv= astro-ph/0403597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Curvature: open or closed====
When cosmologists speak of the universe as being "open" or "closed", they most commonly are referring to whether the curvature is negative or positive. These meanings of open and closed are different from the mathematical meaning of open and closed used for sets in topological spaces and for the mathematical meaning of open and closed manifolds, which gives rise to ambiguity and confusion. In mathematics, there are definitions for a [[closed manifold]] (i.e., compact without boundary) and [[open manifold]] (i.e., one that is not compact and without boundary). A "closed universe" is necessarily a closed manifold. An "open universe" can be either a closed or open manifold. For example, in the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker]] (FLRW) model the universe is considered to be without boundaries, in which case "compact universe" could describe a universe that is a closed manifold.

====Milne model ("spherical" expanding)====
{{Main|Milne model}}
If one applies [[Minkowski space]]-based [[special relativity]] to expansion of the universe, without resorting to the concept of a [[curved spacetime]], then one obtains the Milne model. Any spatial section of the universe of a constant age (the [[proper time]] elapsed from the Big Bang) will have a negative curvature; this is merely a [[pseudo-Euclidean space|pseudo-Euclidean]] geometric fact analogous to one that [[concentric]] spheres in the ''flat'' [[Euclidean space]] are nevertheless curved.
Spatial geometry of this model is an unbounded [[hyperbolic space]].
The entire universe is contained within a [[light cone]], namely the future cone of the Big Bang. For any given moment {{math|''t''&gt; 0}} of [[coordinate time]] (assuming the Big Bang has {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}), the entire universe is bounded by a [[sphere]] of radius exactly {{math|''[[speed of light|c]] t''}}.
The apparent paradox of an infinite universe contained within a sphere is explained with [[length contraction]]: the galaxies farther away, which are travelling away from the observer the fastest, will appear thinner.

This model is essentially a [[degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate]] FLRW for {{math|Ω {{=}} 0}}. It is incompatible with observations that definitely rule out such a large negative spatial curvature. However, as a background in which gravitational fields (or gravitons) can operate, due to diffeomorphism invariance, the space on the macroscopic scale, is equivalent to any other (open) solution of Einstein's field equations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7102">'''Simulated phishing''' or a '''phishing test''' is where deceptive emails, similar to malicious emails, are sent by an organisation to their own staff to gauge their response to [[phishing]] and similar email attacks. The emails themselves are often a form of training, but such testing is normally done in conjunction with prior training; and often followed up with more training elements. This is especially the case for those who "fail" by opening any email attachments, or clicking on any included weblinks - or if they were tricked into entering any credentials.

==Rationale==
There is wide acceptance within the IT security field that technical measures alone cannot stop all malicious email attacks, and that good training of staff is necessary.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Simulated phishing allows the direct measurement of staff compliance, and when run regularly, can measure progress in user behavior. Phishing simulation is recommended by various official agencies, who often provide guidelines for designing such policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Designing Phishing Simulations |url=https://www.cpni.gov.uk/system/files/documents/51/d7/phishing_simulations_guide.pdf |website=Center for the Protection of National Infrastructure |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phishing simulations are sometime compared to [[fire drill]]s in giving staff regular practice in correct behaviour.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==Ethics==
Such campaigns need to be authorised at an appropriate level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kovacs |first1=Eduard |title=Attack on DNC Part of Simulated Phishing Test |url=https://www.securityweek.com/attack-dnc-part-simulated-phishing-test |accessdate=12 September 2018 |work=Security Week |date=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and carried out professionally.&lt;ref name=army&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cheng |first1=Joey |title=Out-of-control Army phishing test results in new guidelines |url=https://defensesystems.com/articles/2014/03/18/army-phishing-email-test.aspx |accessdate=12 September 2018 |work=DefenseSystems |date=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If such a technique is used carelessly it may breach laws, attract law suits and antagonise or traumatise staff. 

However, if employees are advised of a change to policy such that: "the company reserves the right to send deceptive "simulated phishing" email to staff from time to time to gauge staff security awareness and compliance", and training and guidance has been given in advance then such problems should not occur. Some organisations may choose to require users to give their consent by opting-in,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Simulated Phishing |url=https://commons.lbl.gov/display/cpp/Simulated+Phishing |website=Berkeley Lab |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others may allow staff the option to opt-out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Simulated Phishing Email Campaign |url=https://its.ucsc.edu/news/fake-phishing.html |publisher=UC Santa Cruz |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard advice is that "failing' staff not be shamed in any way, but it is appropriate and reasonable to provide supportive followup training.&lt;ref name=fair&gt;{{cite web |last1=Prendergast |first1=Tom |title=Is all fair in simulated phishing? |url=https://www.csoonline.com/article/3237650/phishing/is-all-fair-in-simulated-phishing.html |website=www.csoonline.com |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Meijdam |first1=Katrien |title=Phishing as a Service: Designing an ethical way of mimicking targeted phishing attacks to train employees |url=https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:3134a851-2b40-4af1-896a-41a6ce7a5816/datastream/OBJ1/download |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCHQ&gt;{{cite web |last1=R |first1=Kate |title=The Trouble with Phishing |url=https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/trouble-phishing |website=National Cyber Security Centre |publisher=GCHQ |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some techniques, which might be effective and in use by malicious actors, will be normally be avoided in simulated phishing for ethical or legal reasons. These would include emails with content likely to cause distress to the recipient,&lt;ref name=army/&gt;&lt;ref name=fair/&gt;
or the use of third party trademarks;&lt;ref name=army/&gt;&lt;ref name=fair/&gt; although it is also sometimes argued that this is covered by "[[fair use]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Calarco |first1=Daniel |title=Stop Phishing with Bad Fake Bait |url=https://er.educause.edu/blogs/2017/6/stop-phishing-with-bad-fake-bait |publisher=EDUCAUSEreview |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
Such testing can be done in a number of ways. 
* Many vendors offer web-hosted platforms to do this, and some provide limited free "test" campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Korolov |first1=Maria |title=10 companies that can help you fight phishing |url=https://www.csoonline.com/article/3066532/phishing/10-companies-that-can-help-you-fight-phishing.html |publisher=CSO Online |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A wide range of freely-available open-source tools allow more technical organisations to host and run their own testing.&lt;ref&gt;e.g GoPhish, King Phisher, The SocialEngineer Toolkit&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pauli |first1=Darren |title=Go phish your own staff: Dev builds open-source fool-testing tool |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/02/04/no_more_excuses_dev_builds_dead_easy_open_source_antiphishing_app/ |accessdate=12 September 2018 |work=The Register |date=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Phishing campaign simulators |url=http://www.phishingcountermeasures.com/tools/22-phishing-campaign-simulators |website=Phishing Countermeasures |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some email service now have such testing as a built-in option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ghosh |first1=Debraj |title=GA of Attack Simulator For Office 365 Threat Intelligence |url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Security-Privacy-and-Compliance/GA-of-Attack-Simulator-For-Office-365-Threat-Intelligence/ba-p/183954 |website=Microsoft Tech Community |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lardinois |first1=Frederic |title=Microsoft launches a phishing attack simulator and other security tools |url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/16/microsoft-launches-a-phishing-attack-simulator-and-other-security-tools/ |website=TechCrunch |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because organisations generally have a set of multi-layered defences in place to prevent actual malicious phishing, simulations will often require some [[whitelisting]] to be put in place at email gateways, anti-virus software and web proxies to allow email to reach user desktops and devices and to be acted upon.

==Frequency==
Most advice is that testing should be at done several times per year, to give staff practice in responding correctly, and to provide management feedback on the progress in staff identifying and reporting potentially dangerous email.

The '''SnoCore Tour''', occasionally typeset as '''Sno-Core''', is an annual festival tour of the United States. It features performances by some of the most popular groups largely of the [[alternative rock]] and [[alternative metal|metal]] spectrum. Other than 2008 and 2016, the event has taken place every year since its 1996 inception. SnoCore is marketed towards the [[winter sports]] culture.

==History==
John Boyle and [[Rick Bonde]] established SnoCore as an entertainment opportunity for fans during the year's slow point in live music, the winter season. It would also serve as an excuse for bands to perform for [[Western United States|Western]] mountain resort towns and go snowboarding. SnoCore originally focused predominately on [[punk rock|punk]] and [[ska]] groups and routed through ski communities.&lt;ref&gt; Lounges, Tom [http://www.nwitimes.com/uncategorized/snocore-s-twin-tours-hit-with-a-blizzard-of-modern/article_a5096dea-39a9-56c5-82bb-96ceb60b1082.html  SnoCore's twin tours hit with a blizzard of modern rock] nwitimes.com (January 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; But as it became a national tour, SnoCore aimed toward hard rock and heavy metal and engaged larger, more traditional concert venues.&lt;ref&gt;Barrera, Sandra [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/UNIVERSAL+APPEAL+GALACTIC+PROVIDES+COOL+JAZZ+WITH+A+FUNKY+KICK-a083494613  SnoCore Icicle Ball with Galactic, Les Claypool's Frog Brigade, Lake Trout] TheFreeLibrary.com (January 2001). Retrieved on 1-13-08.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1997, [[ARTISTdirect]] principals Marc Geiger and Don Muller, the former having also co-founded [[Lollapalooza]], purchased the tour from Boyle. They still make a point to schedule dates in a number of resort towns despite having strayed somewhat from its original concept.

Corresponding with its name, SnoCore features large video screens playing footage of freestyle snowboarding and skiing between performances. Local shops have set up at concerts and local resorts have tied in with them. However, SnoCore does not feature [[sideshow]]s as showcased at the [[Warped Tour]] and remains strictly a musical festival. The tour commonly hosts a sponsor; examples include [[Airwalk]] in 1997, [[Levi's]] in 1999, and [[Winterfresh]] in 2005.

On March 10, 1998, Foil Records released the ''[[Sno-Core Compilation]]'' which features various bands that have partaken in the festival. In 2001, SnoCore split into two tours: the [[funk]]/[[jam]] based '''SnoCore Icicle Ball''' and the hard rock/heavy metal based '''SnoCore Rock'''. This carried on once more the following year.

During the 2006 tour, [[stomach flu]] ran its course through all participating bands. Most severely affected was [[Seether]] frontman [[Shaun Morgan]] who, rather than cancel altogether, opted to perform [[acoustic music|acoustic]] sets for their last few shows. This alternative met with high approval from fans and influenced the group to release their first acoustic album, ''[[One Cold Night]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Chris [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1534375/20060615/seether.jhtml Seether Lose Guitarist; Frontman Credits Stomach With Acoustic ''Night''] MTV.com (June 16, 2006). Retrieved on 1-13-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saliva (band)|Saliva]] was scheduled to co-headline the 2009 tour but frontman [[Josey Scott]] needed more time to recover from a recent [[ulcer]] surgery. As a result, the band intended to cancel the first two weeks and substitute Scott with Walt Lafty of [[Silvertide]] beginning April 17.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120910055620/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=117255 SALIVA Frontman JOSEY SCOTT Recovering From Emergency Ulcer Surgery] Blabbermouth.net (March 21. 2009).

[[Image:Teatro Carlo Felice - Genoa, Italy.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Interior]]
[[File:CarloFeliceGe.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Back]]
The '''Teatro Carlo Felice''' is the principal [[opera house]] of [[Genoa]], [[Italy]], used for performances of [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[orchestral music]], and [[recital]]s. It is located on the [[Piazza De Ferrari (Genoa)|Piazza De Ferrari]].

The hall is named for Duke [[Charles Felix of Sardinia|Carlo Felice]], and dates from 24 December 1824, when the Most Excellent Department of Theatres was established. On 31 January 1825, local architect [[Carlo Barabino]] submitted his design for the opera house which was to be built on the site of the church of San Domenico. The [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monks were moved elsewhere without delay or ceremony, and the first stone of the new building was laid on 19 March 1826.

The inaugural performance of [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini's]] ''[[Bianca e Fernando]]'' took place on 7 April 1828, even though the structure and decoration were not quite finished. The [[auditorium]] accommodated an audience of about 2,500 in five tiers (each with 33 boxes), a gallery above, and standing room in the orchestra pit. The acoustics were considered among the best of the time.

For nearly forty years from 1853, [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] spent the winter in Genoa, but he had few strong professional ties with the Teatro Carlo Felice. In 1892, Genoa commemorated the 400th anniversary of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus']] discovery of America and to celebrate the occasion the Carlo Felice was renovated and redecorated at a cost of 420,000 lire (nearly £17,000). Verdi was approached to compose a suitable opera, but he declined the honour, making the excuse that he was too old. [[Alberto Franchetti]]'s opera ''[[Cristoforo Colombo (opera)|Cristoforo Colombo]]'' premiered at the Carlo Felice on 6 October 1892.

The hall was altered many times in the years 1859-1934, and remained remarkably unscathed by war until 9 February 1941 when a shell fired by a [[United Kingdom|British]] warship hit the roof, leaving a large hole open to the sky and destroying the ceiling of the auditorium which had been a unique example of 19th-century [[rococo]] extravagance, its main feature being a wide circle of angels, cherubs and other winged creatures in brightly painted high relief.

Further damage was sustained on 5 August 1943 when incendiary bombs started a backstage fire which destroyed all scenery and wooden fittings, but did not reach the main auditorium. Unfortunately additional damage was caused by looters who stripped the back of the theatre of every possible scrap of metal they could find. Finally, an air raid in September 1944 caused the destruction of the front of the theatre leaving virtually only the outside walls and the corridors behind the tiers of boxes standing. What had been the most richly beautiful of opera houses had become a skeleton of bare walls and roofless porticos.

Reconstruction plans began immediately after the war's close. The first design by [[Paolo Antonio Chessa]] (1951) was rejected; the second by [[Carlo Scarpa]] was approved in 1977 but brought to a halt by his untimely death. [[Aldo Rossi]] ultimately provided today's design, in which portions of the original facade have been recreated but the interior is entirely modern. The hall officially reopened in June 1991, with a main hall holding up to 2,000 seats and a smaller auditorium holding up to 200 seats.

The theatre is the main location of the concert seasons of [[Giovine Orchestra Genovese]], a concert society founded in Genoa in 1912.

'''''The Death of Pompey''''' (''La Mort de Pompée'') is a tragedy by the French playwright [[Pierre Corneille]] on the death of [[Pompey|Pompey the Great]]. It was first performed in 1642, with [[Julius Caesar]] played by [[Molière]].  Like many of Corneille's plays, it is noted for the high tones of its heroine, [[Cornelia Metella|Cornelia]], who admits that her enemy is noble and generous but warns him when he releases her that she will continue to seek his death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Auchincloss]], ''False Dawn'' p 4 {{ISBN|0-385-18021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Turk''', also known as the '''Mechanical Turk''' or '''Automaton Chess Player''' ({{lang-de|Schachtürke}}, "chess Turk"; {{lang-hu|A Török}}), was a fake chess-playing [[artificial intelligence|machine]] constructed in the late 18th century. From 1770 until its destruction by fire in 1854 it was exhibited by various owners as an [[automaton]], though it was eventually revealed to be an elaborate [[hoax]].&lt;ref name="WIllis"&gt;See SCHAFFER, Simon (1999), "Enlightened Automata", in Clark et al. (Eds), ''The Sciences in Enlightened Europe'', Chicago and London, The University of Chicago Press, pp. 126-165.&lt;/ref&gt; Constructed and unveiled in 1770 by [[Wolfgang von Kempelen]] (Hungarian: Kempelen Farkas; 1734–1804) to impress the Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], the mechanism appeared to be able to play a strong game of chess against a human opponent, as well as perform the [[knight's tour]], a puzzle that requires the player to move a [[knight (chess)|knight]] to occupy every square of a chessboard exactly once.

The Turk was in fact a mechanical [[Magic (illusion)|illusion]] that allowed a human chess master hiding inside to operate the machine. With a skilled operator, the Turk won most of the games played during its demonstrations around [[Europe]] and the Americas for nearly 84 years, playing and defeating many challengers including statesmen such as [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. The device was later purchased in 1804 and exhibited by [[Johann Nepomuk Mälzel]]. The chess masters who secretly operated it included [[Johann Baptist Allgaier|Johann Allgaier]], [[Hyacinthe Henri Boncourt|Boncourt]], [[Aaron Alexandre]], [[William Lewis (chess player)|William Lewis]], [[Jacques François Mouret|Jacques Mouret]], and [[William Schlumberger]], but the operators within the mechanism during Kempelen's original tour remain a mystery.

==Construction of the Turk==
[[File:kempelen-charcoal.jpg|right|thumb|A signed [[charcoal]] [[self-portrait]] of [[Wolfgang von Kempelen|Kempelen]], who constructed the Turk]]

Kempelen was inspired to build the Turk following his attendance at the court of Maria Theresa of Austria at [[Schönbrunn Palace]], where [[François Pelletier]] was performing an illusion act. An exchange afterward resulted in Kempelen promising to return to the Palace with an invention that would top the illusions.&lt;ref name="Anomalies"&gt;[[Ricky Jay]], "The Automaton Chess Player, the Invisible Girl, and the Telephone", ''[[Jay's Journal of Anomalies]]'', vol.&amp;nbsp;4 no.&amp;nbsp;4, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tuerkischer schachspieler windisch4.jpg|left|thumb|A copper engraving of the Turk, showing the open cabinets and working parts. A ruler at bottom right provides scale. Kempelen was a skilled engraver and may have produced this image himself.]]
The result of the challenge was the Automaton Chess-player,&lt;ref name="Poe"&gt;Edgar Allan Poe, "Maelzel's Chess-Player", ''Southern Literary Journal'', April 1836; available on the internet via the [http://www.eapoe.org/works/essays/maelzel.htm Edgar Allan Poe Society] of Baltimore, Maryland, URL accessed 19 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Windisch"&gt;Karl Gottlieb von Windisch, ''Briefe über den Schachspieler von Kempelen nebst drey Kupferstichen die diese berühmte Maschine vorstellen'', or ''Inanimate Reason; or, A Circumstantial Account of that Astonishing Piece of Mechanism, M. de Kempelen's Chess-Player, Now Exhibiting at No. 9 Savile-Row, Burlington Gardens'' (London, 1784); translation taken from Levitt.&lt;/ref&gt; known in modern times as the Turk. The machine consisted of a life-sized [[mannequin|model]] of a human head and torso, with a black beard and grey eyes,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Patrick Rice, ''Minding the Machine: Languages of Class in Early Industrial America'' (Berkeley, University of California Press, 2004), 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and dressed in [[Ottoman clothing|Ottoman robes]] and a [[turban]] – "the traditional costume", according to journalist and author [[Tom Standage]], "of an [[The Orient|oriental]] [[magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]]". Its left arm held a long Ottoman smoking pipe while at rest, while its right lay on the top of a large cabinet&lt;ref&gt;Tom Standage, ''The Turk: The Life and Times of the Famous Eighteenth-Century Chess-Playing Machine'' (New York: Walker, 2002), 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; that measured about three-and-a-half [[foot (length)|feet]] (110&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;ref&gt;The dimensions from ''Jay's Journal,'' which expresses them to the nearest half-foot. Metric versions thus can only be precise to the nearest multiple of ''fifteen'' [[centimetre]]s. If we conventionally round to the closest multiple of ''five'' centimetres, the cabinet was very roughly 110×60×75&amp;nbsp;cm and the chessboard very roughly 50&amp;nbsp;cm square.&lt;/ref&gt;) long, two feet (60&amp;nbsp;cm) wide, and two-and-a-half feet (75&amp;nbsp;cm) high. Placed on the top of the cabinet was a chessboard, which measured eighteen inches square. The front of the cabinet consisted of three doors, an opening, and a drawer, which could be opened to reveal a red and white [[ivory]] chess set.&lt;ref&gt;Standage, 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Turk-engraving-figure.jpg|right|thumb|An illustration of the workings of the model. The various parts were directed by a human via interior levers and machinery. This is a distorted measurement based on Racknitz's calculations, showing an impossible design in relation to the actual dimensions of the machine.&lt;ref name="Standage, 88"&gt;Standage, 88&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The interior of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it.&lt;ref name=Anomalies/&gt; When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to [[clockwork]]. The section was designed so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open at the same time one could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as [[brass]] structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.&lt;ref&gt;Standage, 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither the clockwork visible to the left side of the machine nor the drawer that housed the chess set extended fully to the rear of the cabinet; they instead went only one third of the way. A sliding seat was also installed, allowing the operator inside to slide from place to place and thus evade observation as the presenter opened various doors. The sliding of the seat caused dummy machinery to slide into its place to further conceal the person inside the cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Standage, 195–199.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chessboard on the top of the cabinet was thin enough to allow for a magnetic linkage. Each piece in the chess set had a small, strong magnet attached to its base, and when they were placed on the board the pieces would attract a magnet attached to a string under their specific places on the board. This allowed the operator inside the machine to see which pieces moved where on the chess board.&lt;ref&gt;Standage, 202.&lt;/ref&gt; The bottom of the chessboard had corresponding numbers, 1–64, allowing the operator to see which places on the board were affected by a player's move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country| url = https://books.google.com/?id=3VrPAAAAMAAJ| year = 1839| publisher = James Fraser }}&lt;/ref&gt; The internal magnets were positioned in a way that outside magnetic forces did not influence them, and Kempelen would often allow a large magnet to sit at the side of the board in an attempt to show that the machine was not influenced by magnetism.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Leroy Hankins and Robert J. Silverman, ''Instruments and the Imagination'' (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1995), 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a further means of misdirection, the Turk came with a small wooden coffin-like box that the presenter would place on the top of the cabinet.&lt;ref name=Anomalies/&gt; While [[Johann Nepomuk Mälzel]], a later owner of the machine, did not use the box,&lt;ref&gt;Gerald M. Levitt, ''The Turk, Chess Automaton'' (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2000), 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Kempelen often peered into the box during play, suggesting that the box controlled some aspect of the machine.&lt;ref name=Anomalies/&gt; The box was believed by some to have supernatural power; [[Karl Gottlieb von Windisch]] wrote in his 1784 book ''Inanimate Reason'' that "[o]ne old lady, in particular, who had not forgotten the tales she had been told in her youth&amp;nbsp;… went and hid herself in a window seat, as distant as she could from the ''evil spirit,'' which she firmly believed [[spiritual possession|possessed]] the machine".&lt;ref name=Windisch/&gt;

[[File:Tuerkischer schachspieler racknitz3.jpg|left|thumb|A cross-section of the Turk from Racknitz, showing how he thought the operator sat inside as he played his opponent. Racknitz was wrong both about the position of the operator and the dimensions of the automaton.&lt;ref name="Standage, 88"/&gt;]]

The interior also contained a [[perforated hardboard|pegboard]] chess board connected to a [[pantograph]]-style series of levers that controlled the model's left arm. The metal pointer on the pantograph moved over the interior chessboard, and would simultaneously move the arm of the Turk over the chessboard on the cabinet. The range of motion allowed the operator to move the Turk's arm up and down, and turning the lever would open and close the Turk's hand, allowing it to grasp the pieces on the board. All of this was made visible to the operator by using a simple candle, which had a ventilation system through the model.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 147–150.&lt;/ref&gt; Other parts of the machinery allowed for a clockwork-type sound to be played when the Turk made a move, further adding to the machinery illusion, and for the Turk to make various facial expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Sound: Standage, 27–9. Facial expressions: George Atkinson, ''Chess and Machine Intuition'' (Exeter: Intellect, 1998), 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Speech synthesis#History|voice box]] was added following the Turk's acquisition by Mälzel, allowing the machine to say "Échec!" (French for "[[check (chess)|check]]") during matches.&lt;ref name=Poe/&gt;

An operator inside the machine also had tools to assist in communicating with the presenter outside. Two brass discs equipped with numbers were positioned opposite each other on the inside and outside of the cabinet. A rod could rotate the discs to the desired number, which acted as a code between the two.&lt;ref&gt;Standage, 203–204.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition==
The Turk made its debut in 1770 at [[Schönbrunn Palace]], about six months after Pelletier's act. Kempelen addressed the court, presenting what he had built, and began the demonstration of the machine and its parts. With every showing of the Turk, Kempelen began by opening the doors and drawers of the cabinet, allowing members of the audience to inspect the machine. Following this display, Kempelen would announce that the machine was ready for a challenger.&lt;ref&gt;Standage, 24–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kempelen would inform the player that the Turk would use the [[Rules of chess#Initial setup|white pieces]] and have the first move. Between moves the Turk kept its left arm on the cushion. The Turk could nod twice if it threatened its opponent's [[queen (chess)|queen]], and three times upon placing the [[king (chess)|king]] in check. If an opponent made an illegal move, the Turk would shake its head, move the piece back and make its own move, thus forcing a forfeit of its opponent's move.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Dutens]], a traveller who observed a showing of the Turk, attempted to trick the machine "by giving the Queen the move of a Knight, but my mechanic opponent was not to be so imposed upon; he took up my Queen and replaced her in the square from which I had moved her".&lt;ref name="Dutens"&gt;Louis Dutens, from a letter published in ''Le Mercure du France'' ([[Paris]], circa October 1770; later translated into English and reprinted in ''Gentleman's Magazine'' ([[London]]); translation taken from Levitt.&lt;/ref&gt; Kempelen made it a point to traverse the room during the match, and invited observers to bring magnets, irons, and [[lodestone]]s to the cabinet to test whether the machine was run by a form of magnetism or weights. The first person to play against the Turk was [[Count Ludwig von Cobenzl]], an Austrian [[courtier]] at the palace. Along with other challengers that day, he was quickly defeated, with observers of the match stating that the machine played aggressively, and typically beat its opponents within thirty minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Standage, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Turk-knights-tour.svg|left|thumb|The [[knight's tour]], as solved by the Turk. The closed loop that is formed allows the tour to be completed from any starting point on the board.&lt;ref name="Standage, 30–31"&gt;Standage, 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Another part of the machine's exhibition was the completion of the [[knight's tour]], a famed chess puzzle. The puzzle requires the player to move a knight around a chessboard, touching each square once along the way. While most experienced chess players of the time still struggled with the puzzle, the Turk was capable of completing the tour without any difficulty from any starting point via a pegboard used by the operator with a mapping of the puzzle laid out.&lt;ref name="Standage, 30–31"/&gt;

The Turk also had the ability to converse with spectators using a letter board. The operator, whose identity during the period when Kempelen presented the machine at Schönbrunn Palace is unknown,&lt;ref&gt;Standage, 204–205&lt;/ref&gt; was able to do this in English, French, and German. [[Carl Hindenburg|Carl Friedrich Hindenburg]], a university mathematician, kept a record of the conversations during the Turk's time in [[Leipzig]] and published it in 1789 as ''Über den Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen und dessen Nachbildung'' (or ''On the Chessplayer of Mr. von Kempelen And Its Replica''). Topics of questions put to and answered by the Turk included its age, marital status, and its secret workings.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tour of Europe==
Following word of its debut, interest in the machine grew across Europe. Kempelen, however, was more interested in his other projects and avoided exhibiting the Turk, often lying about the machine's repair status to prospective challengers. Von Windisch wrote at one point that Kempelen "refused the entreaties of his friends, and a crowd of curious persons from all countries, the satisfaction of seeing this far-famed machine".&lt;ref&gt;Standage, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In the decade following its debut at Schönbrunn Palace the Turk only played one opponent, Sir [[Robert Murray Keith]], a [[Scotland|Scottish]] noble, and Kempelen went as far as dismantling the Turk entirely following the match.&lt;ref&gt;Standage, 36–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Kempelen was quoted as referring to the invention as a "mere [[:wikt:bagatelle|bagatelle]]", as he was not pleased with its popularity and would rather continue work on [[steam engine]]s and machines that replicated human speech.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Sheryl (2013) "Invented Humans: Kinship and Property in Persons" In: ''Impersonations: Troubling the Person in Law and Culture'', University of Toronto Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4426-6964-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1781, Kempelen was ordered by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] to reconstruct the Turk and deliver it to [[Vienna]] for a state visit from Grand Duke [[Paul I of Russia|Paul of Russia]] and his wife. The appearance was so successful that Grand Duke Paul suggested a tour of Europe for the Turk, a request to which Kempelen reluctantly agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Standage, 40–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:André Philidor.jpg|right|frame|[[François-André Danican Philidor]] won a match against the Turk in [[Paris]] in 1793]]
The Turk began its European tour in 1783, beginning with an appearance in [[France]] in April. A stop at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] preceded an exhibition in Paris, where the Turk lost a match to [[Charles Godefroy de La Tour d'Auvergne]], the [[La Tour d'Auvergne#Later history: Dukes of Bouillon and Albret|Duc de Bouillon]]. Upon arrival in Paris in May 1783, it was displayed to the public and played a variety of opponents, including a lawyer named Mr. Bernard who was a second [[Chess#Titles and rankings|rank]] in chess ability.&lt;ref&gt;Standage, 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the sessions at Versailles, demands increased for a match with [[François-André Danican Philidor]], who was considered the best chess player of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Standage, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Moving to the [[Café de la Régence]], the machine played many of the most skilled players, often losing (e.g. against [[Bernard (chess player)|Bernard]] and [[Verdoni (chess player)|Verdoni]]),&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to Chess'' by David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld (1992),  p. 431&lt;/ref&gt; until securing a match with Philidor at the [[French Academy of Sciences|Académie des Sciences]]. While Philidor won his match with the Turk, Philidor's son noted that his father called it "his most fatiguing game of chess ever!"&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The Turk's final game in Paris was against [[Benjamin Franklin]], who was serving as ambassador to France from the United States. Franklin reportedly enjoyed the game with the Turk and was interested in the machine for the rest of his life, keeping a copy of [[Philip Thicknesse]]'s book ''The Speaking Figure and the Automaton Chess Player, Exposed and Detected'' in his personal library.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 27–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his tour of Paris, Kempelen moved the Turk to [[London]], where it was exhibited daily for five [[shilling]]s. Thicknesse, known in his time as a [[skepticism|skeptic]], sought out the Turk in an attempt to expose the inner workings of the machine.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; While he respected Kempelen as "a very ingenious man",&lt;ref name="Anomalies"/&gt; he asserted that the Turk was an elaborate hoax with a small child inside the machine, describing the machine as "a complicated piece of clockwork&amp;nbsp;... which is nothing more, than one, of many other ingenious devices, to misguide and delude the observers".&lt;ref name="Thicknesse"&gt;Philip Thicknesse, ''The Speaking Figure and the Automaton Chess Player, Exposed and Detected'' (London, 1794), quoted in Levitt's ''The Turk, Chess Automaton.''&lt;/ref&gt;

After a year in London, Kempelen and the Turk travelled to Leipzig, stopping in various European cities along the way. From Leipzig, it went to [[Dresden]], where [[Joseph Friedrich Freiherr von Racknitz]] viewed the Turk and published his findings in ''Über den Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen und dessen Nachbildung'', along with illustrations showing his beliefs about how the machine operated. It then moved to [[Amsterdam]], after which Kempelen is said to have accepted an invitation to the [[Sanssouci]] palace in [[Potsdam]] of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|King of Prussia]]. The story goes that Frederick enjoyed the Turk so much that he paid a large sum of money to Kempelen in exchange for the Turk's secrets. Frederick never gave the secret away, but was reportedly disappointed to learn how the machine worked.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 33–37.&lt;/ref&gt; This story is almost certainly apocryphal; there is no evidence of the Turk's encounter with Frederick, the first mention of which comes in the early 19th century, by which time the Turk was also incorrectly said to have played against [[George III]] of England.&lt;ref&gt;Standage, 90-91&lt;/ref&gt; It seems most likely that the machine stayed dormant at Schönbrunn Palace for over two decades, although Kempelen attempted unsuccessfully to sell it in his final years. Kempelen died at the age of 70 on 26 March 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mälzel and the machine==
Following the death of Kempelen, the Turk remained unexhibited until 1805 when Kempelen's son decided to sell it to Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, a [[Bavaria]]n musician with an interest in various machines and devices. Mälzel, whose successes included patenting a form of [[metronome]], had tried to purchase the Turk once before, before Kempelen's death. The original attempt had failed, owing to Kempelen's asking price of 20,000 [[franc]]s; Kempelen's son sold the machine to Mälzel for half this sum.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon acquiring the Turk, Mälzel had to learn its secrets and make some repairs to get it back in working order. His stated goal was to make explaining the Turk a greater challenge. While the completion of this goal took ten years, the Turk still made appearances, most notably with Napoleon Bonaparte.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1809, [[Napoleon I of France]] arrived at [[Schönbrunn Palace]] to play the Turk. According to an eyewitness report, Mälzel took responsibility for the construction of the machine while preparing the game, and the Turk ([[Johann Baptist Allgaier]]) saluted Napoleon before the start of the match. The details of the match have been published over the years in numerous accounts, many of them contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Standage, 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bradley Ewart, it is believed that the Turk sat at its cabinet, and Napoleon sat at a separate chess table. Napoleon's table was in a roped-off area and he was not allowed to cross into the Turk's area, with Mälzel crossing back and forth to make each player's move and allowing a clear view for the spectators. In a surprise move, Napoleon took the first turn instead of allowing the Turk to make the first move, as was usual; but Mälzel allowed the game to continue. Shortly thereafter, Napoleon attempted an illegal move. Upon noticing the move, the Turk returned the piece to its original spot and continued the game. Napoleon attempted the illegal move a second time, and the Turk responded by removing the piece from the board entirely and taking its turn. Napoleon then attempted the move a third time, the Turk responding with a sweep of its arm, knocking all the pieces off the board. Napoleon was reportedly amused, and then played a real game with the machine, completing nineteen moves before tipping over his king in surrender.&lt;ref name="Ewart"&gt;Bradley Ewart, ''Chess: Man vs. Machine'' (London: Tantivy, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; Alternate versions of the story include Napoleon being unhappy about losing to the machine, playing the machine at a later time, playing one match with a magnet on the board, and playing a match with a [[shawl]] around the head and body of the Turk in an attempt to obscure its vision.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 39–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1811, Mälzel brought the Turk to [[Milan]] for a performance with [[Eugène de Beauharnais]], the Prince of Venice and Viceroy of Italy. Beauharnais enjoyed the machine so much that he offered to purchase it from Mälzel. After some serious bargaining, Beauharnais acquired the Turk for 30,000 francs – three times what Mälzel had paid – and kept it for four years. In 1815, Mälzel returned to Beauharnais in [[Munich]] and asked to buy the Turk back. Two versions of how much he had to pay exist, eventually working out an agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 42–23&lt;/ref&gt; One version appeared in the France Letter ''Palamede''.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;"The writer in the ''Palamede'' makes the result a kind of partnership in an exhibitiontour – the title of the Automaton was to remain in the princely owner, and Maelzel was to pay the interest of the original cost as his partner's fair proportion of the profits. But another account – current, I believe, at Munich – makes the transaction to have been a sale: Maelzel bought back the Automaton for the same thirty thousand francs, and was to pay for it out of the profits of his exhibitions – " Provided, nevertheless", that Maelzel was not to leave the Continent to give such exhibitions. The latter account I believe to be the more correct one".
The Book of the first American Chess Congress, page 427,[https://books.google.com/books?id=HrBAAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=Mr.%20Maelzel%20often&amp;pg=PA427&amp;ci=99%2C753%2C778%2C337&amp;source=bookclip Online]&lt;/ref&gt; The complete story does not make a lot of sense since Mälzel visited Paris again, and he also could import his "Conflagration of Moscow".&lt;ref group=Note&gt;"Mr. Maelzel, who had already experienced some regret at parting with his protegi, requested the favour to be again reinstated in the charge, promising to pay Eugene the interest of the thirty thousand francs Mr. M. hod pocketed. This proposition was graciously conceded by the gallant Beauharnois, and Maelzel thus had the satisfaction of finding he had made a tolerably good bargain, '''getting literally the money for nothing at all!'''
Leaving Bavaria with the Automaton, Maelzel was once more en ramie, as travelling showman of the wooden genius. Other automata were adopted into the family, and a handsome income was realised by their ingenious proprietor. Himself an inferior player, he called the assistance of first-rale talent to the field as his ally. On limits compel us to skip over some interval of time here, during which M. Boncourt (we believe) was Slaelzel's chef in Paris, where the machine was received with all its former favour; and we take up the subject in 1819, when Maelzel again appeared with the Chess Automaton in London". Fraser's magazine for town and country, Band 19, James Fraser, 1839 [https://books.google.com/books?id=3VrPAAAAMAAJ&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA726&amp;ci=547%2C118%2C404%2C299&amp;source=bookclip Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henkin12.jpg|right|thumb|An advertisement for [[Johann Nepomuk Mälzel|Mälzel's]] appearance with the Turk in [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;]]Following the repurchase, Mälzel brought the Turk back to Paris where he made acquaintances of many of the leading chess players at Café de la Régence. Mälzel stayed in France with the machine until 1818, when he moved to London and held a number of performances with the Turk and many of his other machines. In London, Mälzel and his act received a large amount of press, and he continued improving the machine,&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 45–48.&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately installing a voice box so the machine could say "Échec!" when placing a player in check.&lt;ref&gt;Standage, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1819, Mälzel took the Turk on a tour of the United Kingdom. There were several new developments in the act, such as allowing the opponent the first move and eliminating the king's bishop's [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] from the Turk's pieces. This [[Chess handicap#Other forms of handicap|pawn handicap]] created further interest in the Turk, and spawned a book by W. J. Hunneman chronicling the matches played with this handicap.&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Hunneman, ''Chess. A Selection of Fifty Games, from Those Played by the Automaton Chess-Player, During Its Exhibition in London, in 1820'' (1820); quotation taken from Levitt.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the handicap, the Turk (operated by [[Jacques François Mouret|Mouret]] at the time&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Companion to Chess – David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld (1992) p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;) ended up with forty-five victories, three losses, and two [[stalemate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mälzel in America==
The appearances of the Turk were profitable for Mälzel, and he continued by taking it and his other machines to the United States. In 1826, he opened an exhibition in [[New York City]] that slowly grew in popularity, giving rise to many newspaper stories and anonymous threats of exposure of the secret. Mälzel's problem was finding a proper operator for the machine,&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; having trained an unknown woman in France before coming to the United States. He ended up recalling a former operator, [[William Schlumberger]], from [[Alsace]] in Europe to come to America and work for him again once Mälzel was able to provide the money for Schlumberger's transport.

Upon Schlumberger's arrival, the Turk debuted in [[Boston]], Mälzel spinning a story that the New York chess players could not handle full games and that the Boston players were much better opponents.&lt;ref&gt;In Boston in 1826 the automaton chess player appeared at [[Julien Hall (Boston)|Julien Hall]]. (cf. Boston Commercial Gazette, Sept. 14, 1826)&lt;/ref&gt; This was a success for many weeks, and the tour moved to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] for three months. Following Philadelphia, the Turk moved to [[Baltimore]], where it played for a number of months, including losing a match against [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton|Charles Carroll]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. The exhibition in Baltimore brought news that two brothers had constructed their own machine, the [[Walker Chess-player]]. Mälzel viewed the competing machine and attempted to buy it, but the offer was declined and the duplicate machine toured for a number of years, never receiving the fame that Mälzel's machine did and eventually falling into obscurity.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 71–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mälzel continued with exhibitions around the United States until 1828, when he took some time off and visited Europe, returning in 1829. Throughout the 1830s, he continued to tour the United States, exhibiting the machine as far west as the [[Mississippi River]] and visiting [[Canada]]. In [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia]], the Turk was observed by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], who was writing for the ''[[Southern Literary Messenger]]''. Poe's essay "[[Maelzel's Chess Player]]" was published in April 1836 and is the most famous essay on the Turk, even though many of Poe's hypotheses were incorrect (such as that a chess-playing machine must always win).&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 83–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mälzel eventually took the Turk on his second tour to [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. In Cuba, Schlumberger died of [[yellow fever]], leaving Mälzel without a operator for his machine. Dejected, Mälzel died at sea in 1838 at the age of 66 during his return trip, leaving his machinery with the ship captain.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 87–91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Willard Fiske 1859 420–483"&gt;{{cite book| author = Daniel Willard Fiske| title = The Book of the first American Chess Congress: Containing the Proceedings of that celebrated Assemblage, held in New York, in the Year 1857| url = https://books.google.com/?id=HrBAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA420| year = 1859| publisher = Rudd &amp; Carleton| pages = 420–483 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years and beyond==
[[File:TurkSColes.jpg|thumb|150px|[[John Gaughan]]'s reconstructed Turk]]
Upon the return of the ship on which Mälzel died, his various machines, including the Turk, fell into the hands of a friend of Mälzel's, the businessman John Ohl. He attempted to auction off the Turk, but owing to low bidding ultimately bought it himself for $400.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Only when [[John Kearsley Mitchell]] from Philadelphia, Edgar Allan Poe's personal physician and an admirer of the Turk, approached Ohl did the Turk change hands again.&lt;ref name=Anomalies/&gt; Mitchell formed a restoration club and went about the business of repairing the Turk for public appearances, completing the restoration in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

As interest in the Turk outgrew its location, Mitchell and his club chose to donate the machine to the [[Peale Museum|Chinese Museum]] of [[Charles Willson Peale]]. While the Turk still occasionally gave performances, it was eventually relegated to the corners of the museum and forgotten about until 5 July 1854, when a fire that started at the National Theater in Philadelphia reached the Museum and destroyed the Turk.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell believed he had heard "through the struggling flames&amp;nbsp;... the last words of our departed friend, the sternly whispered, oft repeated syllables, 'echec! echec!!&lt;!--The double exclamation points are direct from the text, please do not adjust -bdj --&gt;{{' "}}&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;Silas Weir Mitchell, "The Last of a Veteran Chess Player", ''The Chess Monthly,'' January 1857; reprinted in Levitt's ''The Turk, Chess Automaton.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Gaughan]], an American manufacturer of equipment for magicians based in [[Los Angeles]], spent $120,000 building his own version of Kempelen's machine over a five-year period from 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 243.&lt;/ref&gt; The machine uses the original chessboard, which was stored separately from the original Turk and was not destroyed in the fire. The first public display of Gaughan's Turk was in November 1989 at a history of [[magic (illusion)|magic]] conference. The machine was presented much as Kempelen presented the original, except that the opponent was replaced by a [[computer chess|computer running a chess program]].&lt;ref&gt;Standage, 216–217.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revealing the secrets==
While many books and articles were written during the Turk's life about how it worked, most were inaccurate, drawing incorrect inferences from external observation.

It was not until Dr. Silas Mitchell's series of articles for ''[[The Chess Monthly]]'' that the secret was fully revealed. Mitchell, son of the final private owner of the Turk,&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 236.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that "no secret was ever kept as the Turk's has been. Guessed at, in part, many times, no one of the several explanations&amp;nbsp;... ever solved this amusing puzzle". As the Turk was lost to fire at the time of this publication, Silas Mitchell felt that there were "no longer any reasons for concealing from the amateurs of chess, the solution to this ancient enigma".&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;

The most important biographical history about the Chess-player and Mälzel was presented in ''The Book of the First American Chess Congress'', published by [[Daniel Willard Fiske]] in 1857.&lt;ref name="Daniel Willard Fiske 1859 420–483"/&gt;  The account, "The Automaton Chess-Player in America," was written by Professor George Allen of Philadelphia, in the form of a letter to William Lewis, one of the former operators of the chess automaton.

In 1859, a letter published in the ''[[Philadelphia Sunday Dispatch]]'' by William F. Kummer, who worked as a operator under John Mitchell, revealed another piece of the secret: a candle inside the cabinet. A series of tubes led from the lamp to the turban of the Turk for ventilation. The smoke rising from the turban would be disguised by the smoke coming from the other [[candelabra]] in the area where the game was played.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1859, an uncredited article appeared in ''[[Littell's Living Age]]'' that purported to be the story of the Turk from French magician [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]]. This was rife with errors ranging from dates of events to a story of a Polish officer whose legs were amputated, but ended up being rescued by Kempelen and smuggled back to [[Russia]] inside the machine.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new article about the Turk did not turn up until 1899, when ''[[The American Chess Magazine]]'' published an account of the Turk's match with Napoleon Bonaparte. The story was basically a review of previous accounts, and a substantive published account would not appear until 1947, when ''[[Chess Review]]'' published articles by Kenneth Harkness and Jack Straley Battell that amounted to a comprehensive history and description of the Turk, complete with new diagrams that synthesized information from previous publications. Another article written in 1960 for ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'' by Ernest Wittenberg provided new diagrams describing how the operator sat inside the cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Henry A. Davidson's 1945 publication ''A Short History of Chess'', significant weight is given to Poe's essay which erroneously suggested that the player sat inside the Turk figure, rather than on a moving seat inside the cabinet. A similar error would occur in Alex G. Bell's 1978 book ''The Machine Plays Chess'', which falsely asserted that "the operator was a trained boy (or very small adult) who followed the directions of the chess player who was hidden elsewhere on stage or in the theater…"&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

More books were published about the Turk toward the end of the 20th century. Along with Bell's book, Charles Michael Carroll's ''The Great Chess Automaton'' (1975) focused more on the studies of the Turk. Bradley Ewart's ''Chess: Man vs. Machine'' (1980) discussed the Turk as well as other purported chess-playing automatons.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 154–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the creation of [[IBM Deep Blue|Deep Blue]], [[IBM]]'s attempt at a computer that could challenge the world's best players, that interest increased again, and two more books were published: Gerald M. Levitt's ''The Turk, Chess Automaton'' (2000), and Tom Standage's ''The Turk: The Life and Times of the Famous Eighteenth-Century Chess-Playing Machine'', published in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Deep Blue: Feng-hsiung Hsu, ''Behind Deep Blue: Building the Computer that Defeated the World Chess Champion'' (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2002).

==Legacy and popular culture==
[[File:Ajeeb.jpg|right|thumb|An advertisement for an exhibition of [[Ajeeb]], an imitation of the Turk]]
Owing to the Turk's popularity and mystery, its construction inspired a number of inventions and imitations,&lt;ref name=Anomalies/&gt; including [[Ajeeb]], or "The Egyptian", an American imitation built by Charles Hopper that [[President of the United States|President]] [[Grover Cleveland]] played in 1885, and [[Mephisto (automaton)|Mephisto]], the self-described "most famous" machine, of which little is known.&lt;ref&gt;Imitations: Jay, "The Automaton Chess Player, the Invisible Girl, and the Telephone. Ajeeb or the Egyptian: Ramón Jiménez, "[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=1799 The Rook Endgame Machine of Torres y Quevedo]". ChessBase, 20 July 2004. URL accessed 15 January 2006. Played by Grover Cleveland: ''International Chess Magazine'' September 1885. Mephisto: Levitt, 154.&lt;/ref&gt; The first imitation was made while Mälzel was in [[Baltimore]]. Created by the Brothers Walker, the "American Chess Player" made its debut in May 1827 in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Daniel Willard Fiske| title = The Book of the first American Chess Congress: Containing the Proceedings of that celebrated Assemblage, held in New York, in the Year 1857| url = https://books.google.com/?id=HrBAAAAAcAAJ| year = 1859| publisher = Rudd &amp; Carleton| page = 456 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[El Ajedrecista]] was built in 1912 by [[Leonardo Torres y Quevedo]] as a chess-playing automaton and made its public debut during the Paris World Fair of 1914. Capable of playing rook and king versus king endgames using electromagnets, it was the first true chess-playing automaton, and a precursor of sorts to [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramón Jiménez, "[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=1799 The Rook Endgame Machine of Torres y Quevedo]".&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turk was visited in London by Rev. [[Edmund Cartwright]] in 1784. He was so intrigued by the Turk that he would later question whether "it is more difficult to construct a machine that shall weave than one which shall make all the variety of moves required in that complicated game". Cartwright would patent the [[prototype]] for a [[power loom]] within the year.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Wheatstone|Sir Charles Wheatstone]], an inventor, saw a later appearance of the Turk while it was owned by Mälzel. He also saw some of Mälzel's speaking machines, and Mälzel later presented a demonstration of the speaking machines to the researcher and his teenage son. [[Alexander Graham Bell]] obtained a copy of a book by [[Wolfgang von Kempelen]] on speaking machines after being inspired by seeing a similar machine built by Wheatstone; Bell went on to [[Invention of the telephone|file the first successful patent for the telephone]].&lt;ref name=Anomalies/&gt;

A play, ''The Automaton Chess Player'', was presented in New York City in 1845. The advertising, as well as an article that appeared in ''The Illustrated London News'', claimed that the play featured Kempelen's Turk, but it was in fact a copy of the Turk created by J. Walker, who had earlier presented the Walker Chess-player.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 241–242.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raymond Bernard|Raymond Bernard's]] silent feature film ''[[The Chess Player]]'' (''The Chess Player'', France 1927) weaves elements from the real story of the Turk into an adventure tale set in the aftermath of the first of the [[Partitions of Poland]] in 1772. The film's "Baron von Kempelen" helps a dashing young Polish nationalist on the run from the occupying Russians, who also happens to be an expert chess player, by hiding him inside a chess playing automaton called the Turk, closely based on the real Kempelen model. Just as they are about to escape over the border, the Baron is summoned to [[Saint Petersburg]] to present the Turk to the empress [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]].

The Turk has also inspired works of literary fiction. In 1849, just a few years before the Turk was destroyed, [[Edgar Allan Poe]] published a tale "Von Kempelen and His Discovery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Sova| first = Dawn B.| title = Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z| year = 2001| publisher = Checkmark Books| location = New York| isbn = 0-8160-4161-X }}, the tale is available at [[s:Von Kempelen and His Discovery|Wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ambrose Bierce]]'s short story "[[Moxon's Master]]", published in 1909, is a morbid tale about a chess-playing automaton that resembles the Turk. In 1938, [[John Dickson Carr]] published ''[[The Crooked Hinge]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Time'', "[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,883155,00.html Mystery of the Month]". 31 October 1938, URL accessed 14 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[locked-room mystery]] in his line of [[Gideon Fell|Dr. Gideon Fell]] detective novels. Among the puzzles presented included an automaton that operates in a way that is unexplainable to the characters.&lt;ref&gt;S. T. Joshi, ''John Dickson Carr: A Critical Study''. [[Bowling Green State University|Bowling Green Press]], 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Wolfe]]'s 1977 [[science fiction]] short story "The Marvellous Brass Chessplaying Automaton" also features a device very similar to the Turk.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terry Carr]] (Editor), ''Universe 7''. Doubleday, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Löhr|Robert Loehr's]] 2007 novel "The Chess Machine" (published in the UK as "The Secrets of the Chess Machine") focuses on the man inside the machine. [[F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre]]'s 2007 story "The Clockwork Horror" reconstructs Edgar Allan Poe's original encounter with Mälzel's chess-player, and also establishes (from contemporary advertisements in a Richmond newspaper) precisely when and where this encounter took place.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Robert Smith (author)|James Robert Smith]] &amp; [[Stephen Mark Rainey]] (editors), ''[[Evermore (book)|Evermore]]'', Arkham House, 2007; reprinted in [[Stephen Jones (author)|Stephen Jones]] (editor), ''[[The Mammoth Book of Best New Horror]]'', Carroll &amp; Graf, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Benjamin]] alludes to the Mechanical Turk in the first thesis of his ''[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]'' (''Über den Begriff der Geschichte''), written in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Walter Benjamin| title = Illuminations| year = 1968| publisher = Schocken| isbn = 978-0-8052-0241-0| page = 253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wembley Central rail crash''' was a fatal [[Train wreck|railway accident]] that occurred on 11 October 1984 just outside [[Wembley Central railway station]], [[Greater London]].

The 17:54 passenger train from [[London Euston|Euston]] to [[Bletchley]], formed by two [[British Rail Class 310|Class 310]] [[electric multiple unit]]s, collided with a Freightliner train which was leaving [[Willesden]] yard. The first two coaches of the passenger train overturned onto their sides and three passengers were killed; 17 passengers and the driver were injured.

The passenger train had [[Signal passed at danger|passed a signal at 'danger']] after the driver had suffered a transient episode of [[amnesia]], brought about by a rare medical condition. As a result, he had cancelled the [[Automatic Warning System|AWS]] warnings at the signals approaching Wembley without realising.

==Incident==
Shortly after 18:00 a Freighter train, 4D62, the 16:00 from [[Willesden railway station|Willesden]] to [[Holyhead railway station|Holyhead]] consisting of electric locomotive 86006, locomotive 85035 and 20 loaded Freighter vehicles was signalled from a goods line on to the Down Slow line just to the south of Wembley Central Station. The train attempted to negotiate the crossovers that led from the goods line to the Down Slow line when its eleventh wagon was struck by an eight-car electric multiple-unit passenger train, 2A85, the 17:54 from [[Euston railway station|Euston]] to [[Bletchley railway station|Bletchley]], consisting of two 4-car Class 310 electric multiple-units. The resulting impact led to the deflection of the passenger train to its left towards the adjacent Fast lines with the remaining coaches derailed and overturned onto their sides apart from the rearmost coach.{{sfn|Rose|1986|pp=1–2}}

Emergency services were quickly called to the scene and arrived within twelve minutes. The resulting collision caused damage to track, signalling and overhead line equipment with the debris blocking all main lines into and out of Euston. Three passengers died, with a further seventeen passengers, including the driver of the passenger train, taken to a nearby hospital, with two detained. One detained passenger was released on 15 October and the other on 1 November.{{sfn|Rose|1986|pp=1–2}}

==Aftermath==
The Down Fast line was restored at 18:22 on 12 October and later closed to traffic on 14 October to enable repairs to be completed. The Up Slow line was restored at 18:54 on 13 October and the Down Slow Line was restored on 06:00 on 15 October.{{sfn|Rose|1986|pp=1–2}}

==Investigation and report==
A formal inquiry was ordered under the [[Regulation of Railways Act 1871]] and was conducted by the Chief Inspecting Officer of Railways who opened the inquiry. Evidence was heard in public in [[London]] on 9 November and addressed the question of whether the freight train was moving or stationary at the moment of impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Train Crash (Wembley) (Hansard, 26 October 1984)|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1984/oct/26/train-crash-wembley|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical board===
The investigation turned its attention to the medical board when it was discovered that the driver Ronald Armstrong (born 25 July 1921) was found to have an unusual medical history. Armstrong regularly informed the board about suffering episodes of irregular disturbed vision that occurred three to four times a year without warning. Armstrong said he did not have such an episode when driving a train although he did suffer disturbed vision while driving his car.{{sfn|Rose|1986|pp=11–12}}

Armstrong had also suffered from morning headaches which dated back many years which often occurred when getting up. Although the symptoms were dull, never severe and frontal in situation, he slept well but tended to wake in the early hours. He also suffered from bouts of [[indigestion]], which was treated with bicarbonate of soda. Armstrong also suffered from [[panic attacks]] with an episode occurring before the accident. One medical condition he no longer suffered from was breathlessness and he also lost his sense of smell 18 months before the accident occurred.{{sfn|Rose|1986|pp=11–12}}

The '''''White Ship'''''  (real name: {{lang-fr|la Blanche-Nef}}, Latin documents {{lang-la|Candida navis}}) was a vessel that sank in the [[English Channel]] near the [[Normandy]] coast off [[Barfleur]], on 25 November 1120. Only one of those aboard survived.&lt;ref&gt;There are seven accounts of the disaster: [[Orderic Vitalis]], ''Historia ecclesiastica'' 12.26 (ed. and trans. Chibnall, 1978, pp. 294–307); [[William of Malmesbury]], ''Gesta regum Anglorum'' 5.419 (ed. and trans. Mynors, Thomson, and Winterbottom, 1998, pp. 758–763); [[Simeon of Durham]], ''Historia regum'' 100.199 (ed. T. Arnold, 1885, vol. 2, pp. 258–9); [[Eadmer]], ''Historia nouorum in Anglia'' (ed. M. Rule, 1884, pp. 288–9), [[Henry of Huntingdon]], ''Historia Anglorum'' 7.32 (ed. and trans. Greenway, 1996, pp. 466–7), [[Hugh the Chanter]], ''History of the Church at York'' (ed. and trans. Johnson, 1990, pp. 164–5), [[Robert of Torigni]], ''Gesta Normannorum ducum'' (ed. and trans. E. van Houts, 1995, vol. 2, pp. 216–19, 246–51, 274–7), and [[Wace]], ''Roman de Rou'', pt. iii, lines 10173–262 (ed. A. Holden, 1973, vol. 2, pp. 262–6).&lt;/ref&gt; Those who drowned included [[William Adelin]], the only legitimate son and heir of King [[Henry I of England]], his half-sister [[Matilda FitzRoy, Countess of Perche|Matilda]], his half-brother [[Richard of Lincoln, Norman Prince|Richard]] and also Richard d'Avranches, 2nd Earl of Chester. William Adelin's death led to a succession crisis and a period of civil war in England known as [[the Anarchy]].

==Shipwreck==
The ''White Ship'' was a newly refitted vessel captained by [[Thomas FitzStephen]] (''Thomas filz Estienne''), whose father Stephen FitzAirard (''Estienne filz Airard'') had been captain of the ship [[Mora (ship)|''Mora'']] for [[William the Conqueror]] when he [[Norman conquest of England|invaded England in 1066]].&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth M.C, van Houts, 'The Ship List of William the Conqueror', ''Anglo-Norman Studies X: Proceedings of the Battle Conference 1987'', ed. R. Allen Brown (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 1988), pp. 172–73&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas offered his ship to [[Henry I of England]] to use it to return to England from [[Barfleur]] in [[Normandy]].&lt;ref name="HIKE165"&gt;Judith A. Green, ''Henry I: King of England and Duke of Normandy'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Henry had already made other arrangements, but allowed many in his retinue to take the ''White Ship,'' including his heir, [[William Adelin]]; his illegitimate son [[Richard of Lincoln (illegitimate son of Henry I of England)|Richard of Lincoln]]; his illegitimate daughter [[Matilda FitzRoy, Countess of Perche]]; and many other nobles.&lt;ref name="HIKE165"/&gt; According to chronicler [[Orderic Vitalis]], the crew asked William Adelin for wine and he supplied it to them in great abundance.&lt;ref name="HIKE165"/&gt; By the time the ship was ready to leave there were about 300 people on board although some had disembarked due to the excessive drinking before the ship sailed.&lt;ref name="RCDN269"&gt;William M. Aird, ''Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy c. 1050–1134'' (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2008), p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship's captain, Thomas FitzStephen, was ordered by the revellers to overtake the king's ship, which had already sailed.&lt;ref name="RCDN269"/&gt; The ''White Ship'' was fast, of the best construction and had recently been fitted with new materials, which made the captain and crew confident they could reach England first. But when it set off in the dark, its port side struck a submerged rock called ''Quillebœuf'', and the ship quickly capsized.&lt;ref name="RCDN269"/&gt; William Adelin got into a small boat and could have escaped but turned back to try to rescue his half-sister, Matilda, when he heard her cries for help. His boat was swamped by others trying to save themselves, and William drowned along with them.&lt;ref name="RCDN269"/&gt; According to Orderic Vitalis, only two survived by clinging to the rock that night. One was Berold (Beroldus or Berout), a butcher from [[Rouen]]; the second, Godfrey, the son of Gilbert of Laigle (''Godefroi de l'Aigle''), eventually drowned. The chronicler further wrote that when Thomas FitzStephen came to the surface after the sinking and learned that William Adelin had not survived, he let himself drown rather than face the King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| publisher = Clarendon Press| isbn = 978-0-19-822243-9| others = Marjorie Chibnall (ed. and trans.)| title = The Ecclesiastical History of Orderic Vitalis| location = Oxford| date = 1978| volume = 6| pages = 298–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One legend holds that the ship was doomed because priests were not allowed to board it in the customary manner.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;[[William of Nangis]] wrote that the ''White Ship'' sank because all the men aboard were [[sodomy|sodomites]]. See: ’’Chron.’’ in Rolls series, ed. W. Stubbs (London, 1879), vol. 2, under A.D. 1120. which reflects the medieval belief that sin caused pestilence and disaster. See also: ''Codex Justinian'', nov. 141. Another theory is expounded by Victoria Chandler, "The Wreck of the ''White Ship''", in ''The final argument : the imprint of violence on society in medieval and early modern Europe'', edited by Donald J. Kagay and L.J. Andrew Villalon (1998). Her theory discusses the possibility of it being a mass murder.&lt;/ref&gt; For a complete list of those who did or did not travel on the ''White Ship'', see [[Victims of the White Ship disaster|Victims of the ''White Ship'' disaster]].

==Repercussions==

[[File:BL Royal 20 A. ii, f. 6v. Henry I &amp; White Ship.jpg|thumb|Henry I and the sinking ''White Ship''.]]

{{main|The Anarchy}}
A direct result of William Adelin's death was the period known as [[the Anarchy]].  The ''White Ship'' disaster had left Henry I with only one legitimate child, a second daughter named [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]].  Although Henry I had forced his barons to swear an oath to support Matilda as his heir on several occasions, a woman had never ruled in England in her own right.  Matilda was also unpopular because she was married to [[Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou]], a traditional enemy of England's Norman nobles.  Upon Henry's death in 1135, the English [[English feudal barony|barons]] were reluctant to accept Matilda as [[queen regnant]].

One of Henry I's male relatives, [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen of Blois]], the king's nephew by his sister Adela, usurped Matilda as well as his older brothers [[William, Count of Sully|William]] and [[Theobald II, Count of Champagne|Theobald]] to become king.  Stephen had allegedly planned to travel on the ''White Ship'' but had disembarked just before it sailed;&lt;ref name="HIKE165"/&gt; Orderic Vitalis attributes this to a sudden bout of [[diarrhoea|diarrhea]] 

After Henry I's death, Matilda and her husband Geoffrey of Anjou, the founder of the Plantagenet dynasty, launched a long and devastating war against Stephen and his allies for control of the English throne. [[The Anarchy]] dragged from 1135 to 1153 with devastating effect, especially in southern England.

Contemporary historian [[William of Malmesbury]] wrote: 
{{quote|No ship that ever sailed brought England such disaster, none was so well known the wide world over. There perished then with William the king's other son Richard, born to him before his accession by a woman of the country, a high-spirited youth, whose devotion had earned his father's love; [[Richard d'Avranches, second Earl of Chester|Richard earl of Chester]] and his brother Othuel, the guardian and tutor of the king's son; the king's daughter the countess of Perche, and his niece, Theobald's sister, the countess of Chester; besides all the choicest knights and chaplains of the court, and the nobles' sons who were candidates for knighthood, for they had hastened to from all sides to join him, as I have said, expecting no small gain in reputation if they could show the king's son some sport or do him some service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Clarendon Press| isbn = 0-19-820678-X| others = R.A.B.

==Historical fiction==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
* Reference to the sinking of the ''White Ship'' is made in [[Ken Follett]]'s novel ''[[The Pillars of the Earth]]'' (1989) and its later [[Ken Follett's The Pillars of the Earth|game adaptation]]. The ship's sinking sets the stage for the entire background of the story, which is based on the subsequent [[civil war]] between Matilda (referred to as Maud in the novel) and Stephen. In Follett's novel, it is implied that the ship may have been sabotaged; this implication is seen in the [[The Pillars of the Earth (miniseries)|TV adaptation]] (even going so far as to show William Adelin assassinated whilst on a lifeboat) and the [[Ken Follett's The Pillars of the Earth|video game adaptation]].
* It is also described in detail by [[Sharon Kay Penman]] in the historical novel ''When Christ and His Saints Slept'' (1994).
* The sinking of the ''White Ship'' is briefly referenced in [[Glenn Cooper]]'s novel ''The Tenth Chamber'' (2010).
* The ''White Ship'' also sets the stage for the 2009 novel ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Hiobs Brüder|de}}'' (The Brothers of Job) by the German author Rebecca Gablé, which details the rise of [[Henry II of England]], son of Empress Matilda.
* The long conflict between Stephen and Matilda is important in the ''[[Cadfael|Brother Cadfael]]'' series. This 20-book set of mysteries, by [[Edith Pargeter|Ellis Peters]], has a 12th-century Benedictine monk as its protagonist. Depending on the book, the conflict is either very important or just serves as a backdrop to the plots. The sinking directly affects the outcome of the short story [[A Rare Benedictine: The Advent of Brother Cadfael#A Light on the Road to Woodstock|"A Light on the Road to Woodstock"]].
* In the [[GURPS]] [[role-playing game]] [[GURPS Infinite Worlds|''Infinite Worlds'']] setting, the Infinity Patrol that travels between parallel universes is opposed by another world with parachronic travel, Centrum.  The point of historical divergence on Centrum is the survival of the ''White Ship'', where William Adelin survives and his descendents lead an Anglo-French Empire that conquers the world.  That empire is later decimated by a nuclear attack on the palace in 1902, leading to civil war and worldwide collapse, which brings about the rise there of the [[socialist]] [[technocratic]] [[meritocracy]] Centrum.

'''''Wrestling Jerusalem''''' is a [[One-person show|one-person play]] exploring the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] as well as wider themes about identity and social division. Devised and performed by actor Aaron Davidman, it features seventeen characters of widely different backgrounds and [[Ideology|ideological]] viewpoints. A fundamental emotional theme of the [[drama]] is the connected nature of sudden life experiences, with the performer describing the influence of events such as the construction of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|West Bank barrier wall]] and American [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] demonstrations. Multiple comparisons take place beyond social divisions; an example of such a blurred moment being the move from performing a [[Jewish]] song in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] to the saying of an [[Islamic]] [[prayer]].&lt;ref name=Laura/&gt;&lt;ref name=Robert/&gt; The drama [[premier]]ed in 2014 at the [[Intersection for the Arts]] complex in [[San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref name=Robert/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vimeo/&gt;

==Background and performances==
Aaron Davidman is a [[American Jews|Jewish-American]] actor who identifies as a socio-political "[[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]]", and he drew upon the occurrences during the many trips that he'd personally taken to [[Israel]] over the years. ''Wrestling Jerusalem'' takes inspiration from his attempt to emotionally comprehend the multiple perspectives that he's encountered, many of them filled with [[anxiety]] and sorrow about traumatic experiences. The [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] weighs heavily on the contents of the [[drama]].&lt;ref name=Laura/&gt;&lt;ref name=Robert/&gt;

The [[one-person show]] features Davidman performing as a wide variety of individuals that vary in not just nationality but also age, occupation, religion, and other such classes, displaying highly contrasting viewpoints. The uncomfortable nature of Israeli security efforts, compared directly to features found in [[Internment|concentration camps]], is explored as well as the horror of witnessing protesters yelling "Death to the Jews" in American [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] demonstrations. Life experiences between characters become blurred in several instances, such as when Davidman switches from performing a [[Jewish]] song in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] to the saying of an [[Islamic]] [[prayer]].&lt;ref name=Laura/&gt;&lt;ref name=Robert/&gt;

In one particular moment, the performer takes the role of an [[Health care in Israel|Israeli doctor]] commenting on the various sufferings that the character has witnessed. The doctor displays a disinterest in weighing what particular group of people has endured more, remarking that "I do not compare levels of trauma". Davidman declares, "It is irrelevant. Trauma is trauma."&lt;ref name=Laura/&gt;

The play had an '[[Off Broadway]]' run in 2016. It was directed by [[Michael John Garcés]],&lt;ref name=Laura&gt;{{citenews|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/theater/review-wrestling-jerusalem-a-solo-show-and-act-of-faith.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|title=Review: ‘Wrestling Jerusalem,’ a Solo Show and Act of Faith|accessdate=April 3, 2017|date=April 4, 2016|first=Laura|last=Collins-Hughes}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had also overseen the drama's 2014 [[premier]] at the [[Intersection for the Arts]] complex in [[San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref name=Robert/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vimeo/&gt; Its production team released a trailer for ''Wrestling Jerusalem'' on the [[Video hosting service|video sharing]] website [[Vimeo.com]] that year as well, highlighting the play's [[Stage lighting|lighting]] and use of music.&lt;ref name=Vimeo&gt;{{citeweb|title=WRESTLING JERUSALEM - Stage Trailer|url=https://vimeo.com/103364996|accessdate=April 16, 2017|publisher=[[Vimeo.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
''Wrestling Jerusalem'' has received a mixed yet supportive review from Laura Collins-Hughes of ''[[The New York Times]]''. She labelled the production a "smartly written solo show" that "trusts in the power of the human voice and the capacity of the human heart." While stating that the characterization becomes "intensely frustrating", with the individuals profiled needing "far more room to breathe than they're allowed", she cited how the drama "believes that listening to one another's stories can change the way we move through the world."&lt;ref name=Laura/&gt;

''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'' has published a laudatory review by Robert Hurwitt, who wrote:
{{Quote|"No answers are forthcoming. We could hardly expect any. Davidman's quest is rooted in the importance of listening to each other to seek understanding. His portraits are riveting, and the varieties of intransigence revealed are disturbing. But for anyone who's been paying attention, they're also painfully familiar."&lt;ref name=Robert&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.sfgate.com/performance/article/Wrestling-Jerusalem-review-Solo-show-goes-to-5325202.php|title='Wrestling Jerusalem' review: Solo show goes to the mat|publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''|date=March 18, 2014|accessdate=April 3, 2017|first=Robert|last=Hurwitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
