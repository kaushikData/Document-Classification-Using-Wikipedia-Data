===Diplomatic career===

Kennedy]], [[United States Department of State|State Department]][[Chief of Protocol]] Angier Biddle Duke (standing), and interpreter James J. Wickel. [[Oval Office]], [[White House]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C]].]]
In 1949, Duke joined the [[United States Foreign Service]] as an assistant in [[Buenos Aires]] and subsequently [[Madrid]]. From 1952 to 1953,&lt;ref name="1952Appointment"&gt;{{cite news|title=New Yorker Is Appointed U.S. Envoy to El Salvador|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1952/03/25/archives/new-yorker-is-appointed-us-envoy-to-el-salvador.html|accessdate=27 November 2017|work=The New York Times|date=25 March 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; he served as the [[United States Ambassador to El Salvador|U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador]] during the Truman administration and was, aged 36, the youngest ever U.S. Ambassador up to that time.&lt;ref name="1953Return"&gt;{{cite news|title=A.

&lt;blockquote&gt;People thought Angie was just a rich playboy when President Truman appointed him Ambassador to El Salvador. He was 32 or 33 years old, the youngest ambassador in United States history, and the Duke name represented entrenched, giant capitalists.&lt;ref name="1981Award"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] out of power in 1953–1961, he left the foreign service and returned to private life.

Kennedy|funeral of John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name="ABDObit1995"/&gt;

In the early 1970s, he was appointed by Mayor [[Abraham Beame]] to serve as Commissioner of the New York City Department of Civic Affairs and Public Events with a staff of 17 until he resigned in 1976 to work for [[Jimmy Carter]]'s campaign for the presidency.&lt;ref name="1974Wedding"&gt;{{cite news|title=Maria‐Luisa Duke Wed To F.

===Later years===

'''{{lang|da|Anpartsselskab}}''' ('''ApS''') is the [[Denmark|Danish]] term for a [[private limited company]]. ApS, when appended to the end of a Danish company name, is similar to [[Ltd.]] after the name of a British company. An ApS is required to have capital of at least 50,000 [[Danish krone|DKK]] (8,220 [[Euro]]s).

'''Aris Alexanian''' (1901 &amp;ndash; June 27, 1961) was a noted world traveller, prominent Armenian Canadian and business man. Also referred to in articles and publications as A. L. Alexanian and Aris L. Alexanian.

==Early life==
Little is known of Aris's early life. He was born in [[Ağın]], [[Turkey]] in 1901. His exact date of birth is unknown.  He was orphaned at an early age with the untimely death of both his parents. He went into hiding for 6 months, in the Anatolia area of Turkey, to escape from the [[Armenian Genocide]]. He was shot and wounded during this period.&lt;ref name="HS"&gt;''Hamilton Spectator'', March 4, 1953, "City merchant Ends 47,000-mile trip"&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually he was able to escape the country. He arrived in [[New York City]] in 1920 then moved to Canada in 1921.

==Georgetown, Ontario Orphanage==
In 1923 Aris moved to [[Georgetown, Ontario]] to become a teacher and assistant superintendent&lt;ref name="JA1"&gt;Apramian, Jack (1976). "The Georgetown Boys". Winona: Georgetown Boy's Association.&lt;/ref&gt; at a school and farm for Armenian orphans.&lt;ref name="HR"&gt;''Hamilton Review'', May 14, 1955, "Taught Orphans in 1922 Still Keeps in Touch Proud of their Success"&lt;/ref&gt; The boys were victims of the [[Armenian Genocide]]. Between 1900 and 1914 Canada took in some 1500 Armenian refugees.&lt;ref name="AEC"&gt;Armenian Embassy of Canada [http://www.armembassycanada.ca/diaspora_history.html "Armenian's in Canada: History"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901184828/http://www.armembassycanada.ca/diaspora_history.html |date=September 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in the early 1920s thousands more came to Canada, including a group that came to be called [[The Georgetown Boys]].&lt;ref name="AEC"/&gt; The Georgetown school took in 109 boys&lt;ref name="JA1"/&gt; who were educated and trained for farming.&lt;ref name="AEC"/&gt; During this period Aris founded and organized the publishing of a monthly newsletter called "Ararat",&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Multicultural Encyclopedia [http://www.multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/a23/7 "Culture"] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20120915072512/http://www.multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/a23/7 |date=September 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured the art and writing of the orphan boys. The newsletter helped develop the English language skills of the boys.&lt;ref name="JA1"/&gt; Aris was included as a character in a play set around the Georgetown orphanage. The play "The Georgetown Boys" was premiered at the John Elliot Theatre in Georgetown in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;KW Record [http://marsha-s.livejournal.com/50343.html?thread=226727 "Georgetown Boys Play"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611152107/http://marsha-s.livejournal.com/50343.html?thread=226727 |date=2011-06-11 }} April 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Aris is also featured as a character in a children's book titled "Call Me Aram", which is also about [[The Georgetown Boys]].&lt;ref&gt;KW Record [http://record.ca/Life/Books/article/496003 "Childrens Books"] February 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; More recently Aris was portrayed as a character in a musical entitled "The Georgetown Boys: A Musical" performed at The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts In April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy Center [http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showEvent&amp;event=RJXDN "The Georgetown Boys: A Musical"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414124408/http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showEvent&amp;event=RJXDN |date=2009-04-14 }} February 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and Family==
In January 1927 in Georgetown, Aris Alexanian married Mary Boghosian, who had recently arrived in Canada from Egypt.&lt;ref name="JA1"/&gt; They lived for a time at the orphanage, before moving to Hamilton.  They eventually had three sons together, Aram, Armen and Albert.

==Move to Hamilton, Ontario==
Aris moved to [[Hamilton, Ontario]] in 1927&lt;ref name="JA1"/&gt; where he opened an oriental rug store, called Oriental Art Galleries.&lt;ref name="JA1"/&gt;  His first year sales were 64 dollars. He imported handmade carpets from around the world, and eventually travelled extensively in the Middle East to buy carpets for his business.&lt;ref name="HS2"&gt;''Hamilton Spectator'',  June 28, 1961, "City Carpet Importer, Aris Alexanian, 60, Dies"&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he also started a rug cleaning operation.

==World Traveller==
During the late 1940s and early 1950s  Aris travelled extensively to the Middle East to buy carpets.&lt;ref name="HS3"&gt;''Hamilton Spectator'', Dec 10, 1954, Beryl Brown, "Arab Robe Tells of Middle East Hospitality"&lt;/ref&gt; Few people in the Hamilton area at the time travelled to these exotic lands, so his trips were a source of local interest.&lt;ref&gt;''Hamilton Spectator'', August 4, 1948,  "Local Man Visits Bazaars of Near East"&lt;/ref&gt; His travels were often chronicled&lt;ref&gt;''Hamilton Spectator'', July 5, 1957, Aris Alexanian, "Circles Earth On Magic Carpet Ride; Finds Big Changes Everywhere", Page 35&lt;/ref&gt; in [[The Hamilton Spectator]]. A map in the window of his downtown Hamilton store was used to trace his journeys. Upon his return from these travels he would often lecture to local community and church groups and show photographs and films from his trips.&lt;ref name="HS3"/&gt; By 1958 he claimed to have travelled 304,000 miles outside the country since the war.&lt;ref&gt;''Hamilton Spectator'',  June 26, 1958, "A. L. Alexanian off Tomorrow on World Tour"&lt;/ref&gt; Aris was also an accomplished linguist and could speak six languages, which he used to his advantage for business negotiations in the more that 15 countries he  typically visited during his travels.&lt;ref name="HS"/&gt;

==Expanding the Carpet Business==
Aris began to expand his carpet business in 1950, and opened a second store in [[Ottawa]] Ontario. He also expanded the rug cleaning operation in Hamilton.&lt;ref name="HS4"&gt;''Hamilton Spectator'',  April 28, 1955, "Alexanian's Forms Limited Company For Rug Business"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 the company was incorporated under the name of Alexanian and Sons Limited.&lt;ref name="HS4"/&gt;

==Community involvement==
Aris Alexanian was involved in numerous community groups. He was a supporter of the Armenian Apostolic Church, The Ancient Landmarks of Hamilton group, and the [[Kiwanis]] Club.&lt;ref name="HS2"/&gt; Aris, through his travels developed many friendships and connections around the world. He was a personal friend of Mirza Osman Ali Baig, the Pakistani High Commissioner to Canada, who visited Hamilton in May 1955, and was a guest speaker at the Hamilton Kiwanis Club.&lt;ref name="HR"/&gt;

==Death of Aris Alexanian==
Aris Alexanian died on June 27, 1961. The biography and obituary printed in the Hamilton Spectator announcing his death described Aris as "one of Canada's leading rug importers and probably Hamilton's most widely travelled merchant".&lt;ref name="HS2"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Aris through his commitment to public service has inspired a long  tradition of community involvement within his family and business. Alexanian Carpet and Flooring has been a long time patron of the arts, in particular, theatre, music and opera.&lt;ref name="OAC"&gt;Ontario Arts Council [http://arts.on.ca/Page2812.aspx "Ontario Arts Council Bio"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706191522/http://arts.on.ca/Page2812.aspx |date=July 6, 2011 }} 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Albert is a member of the Ontario Arts Council, a volunteer executive with the Council for Business and the Arts in Canada and with the Canadian Association of Family Enterprises.&lt;ref name="OAC"/&gt; Armen has been honoured for nearly 50 years of service with the Kiwanis Club, and has held numerous position in the organization, including President. He is also special advisor to the University of Waterloo Circle K Club.&lt;ref&gt;Kiwania Club Bulletin [http://www.kiwanisecc.org/documents/September302009.pdf "Kiwanis Newsletter"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726225445/http://www.kiwanisecc.org/documents/September302009.pdf |date=July 26, 2011 }} 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Aram was a supporter of the Armenian Church of Canada, and a founding member of St. Mary Armenian Church in Hamilton.

'''''Asia Market Wrap''''' is a [[business]] [[news]] programme aired on [[CNBC Asia]] between
1600-1800 ([[Hong Kong]]/[[Singapore]]/[[Taiwan]] time, until December 2005. The show also aired on [[CNBC US]] on 5:30 to 6AM ET until 2000, then it was moved to [[CNBC World]]. Anchored by [[Christine Tan]], ''Asia Market Wrap'' examined the day's headlines and numbers, with in-depth analysis of the day's financial news, interviewing key money managers, market experts and corporate chiefs.

The programme, comes from its original edition on CNBC US, '''''[[Market Wrap]]''''', included several segments, such as ''Australia Market Wrap'', ''China Business Briefing'' and ''Eye on India''. '''''[[Asia Market Week]]''''' - a weekly wrap-up of the market action in Asia - aired between 17:30-18:00 on Fridays.

Prior to [[Martin Soong]]'s original departure from CNBC Asia, he was the programme's regular presenter (the programme was billed as ''Asia Market Wrap with Martin Soong''). When he returned to present '''''[[Asia Squawk Box]]''''', Tan was moved to present ''Asia Market Wrap'' instead.

The programme was not aired on CNBC Asia's [[CNBC Australia]], local opt-out - it was replaced by [[CNBC Europe|CNBC Europe's]] ''[[Morning Exchange (CNBC Europe)|Morning Exchange]]'' (1600 - 1700 HK/SG Time) and [[CNBC|CNBC's]] '''''[[Wake Up Call (CNBC)|Wake Up Call]]''''' (1700 - 1800 HK/SG/TWN Time).

'''''Asia Squawk Box''''' is a television business news program on [[CNBC Asia]], aired Monday through Friday from 6:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.-9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. ([[Hong Kong]]/[[Singapore]]/[[Taiwan]] time). This programme is also aired on [[CNBC World]] in the United States at the respective time (5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. - 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Sunday through Thursday without [[daylight saving time]], 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. - 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. with DST), and on [[CNBC Europe]] from 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.-2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.

==Format==
''Asia Squawk Box'' (''ASB'') covers the opening of the Asian markets and is anchored by [[Akiko Fujita]] and [[Bernard Lo]] in Hong Kong. There is occasionally a guest host. The show has also let its guest hosts join in on the second and third hour just like its [[Squawk Box|US]] and [[Squawk Box Europe|European]] counterparts. Regular contributors include [[Sri Jegarajah]], Eunice Yoon (China), [[Emily Tan]] ([[Hong Kong]]) and Matthew Taylor ([[Sydney]]). Interviews with other analysts and C-level executives are also an essential part of the show.

==History==
''Asia Squawk Box'' debuted in February 1998 at 8.00 Singapore time in February 1998 when CNBC Asia merged with Asia Business News and it was presented by former CNBC Asia Morning Call personalities Rico Hizon (now with BBC World) and [[Geoff Cutmore]] (currently the main presenter of the show's counterpart in Europe, ''Squawk Box Europe'').  Bernard Lo and Cecilia Zecha came in to eventually replace Cutmore and Hizon respectively.  In October 1998, ''Asia Squawk Box'' was extended to 90 minutes and in late 1999, the show started at 7.30 SIN time.  In April 2000, ''Asia Squawk Box'' moved to 7.00 SIN time.  [[Christine Tan]] assumed anchoring duties in July 2000 and on 30 October 2000, the show was extended to two hours with the last half-hour being named Squawk Plus.

In July 2001, ''Asia Squawk Box'' aired for a full three hours like its [[Squawk Box|US counterpart]] from 7am to 10am SIN time.  Around this time, Steven Engel was added to the team as a stockwatcher.  In late 2002, Bettina Chua took over as anchor as Christine Tan was reassigned to the evening hours.  As a result of the cancellation of ''[[Asia Wake Up Call]]'', ''ASB'' moved to the 6 to 9am SIN time timeslot.

In April 2005, [[Martin Soong]] assumed the anchoring duties for the program after Chua's departure from the network.

Since 2006, the Asian version of ''Squawk Box'' has been guided editorially by Senior Producer Derrick McElheron, who also helped launch CNBC's ''[[Worldwide Exchange]]''. As of 2006-10-30 (the same day the Asia network debuted a new graphics package similar to its US and European siblings), the show began using the titles in use by its US counterpart since late 2005, replacing the previous one that was used from 2004-2006.

===2007 relaunch===
On 2007-03-26, with McElheron at the helm, ''Asia Squawk Box'' was relaunched with a new live set, replacing the virtual set it had used since its creation, and a new co-presenter in Amanda Drury.  On that day, the show started using the then-current US music package and returned to the 7 to 10am timeslot and being preceded to give way to a then-new programme, ''[[Squawk Australia]]''.

===2009-2014===
In 2009, Karen Tso took over anchoring duties from Amanda Drury, who moved back to Sydney and later to the US after the cancellation of ''Squawk Australia'' on June 11, 2010.  Former Bloomberg anchor Bernard Lo re-joined the network in early 2010, based out of Hong Kong.  He can now be seen regularly co-anchoring Squawk Box.  Additionally, ''Asia Squawk Box'' moved back to its new/old time slot (6am-9am Singapore/Hong Kong Time) on June 14, 2010.

In late-2011, it was announced that Tso was moving to CNBC Europe in London.  Lisa Oake re-joined the network as co-anchor of ''Asia Squawk Box'' in January 2012.

In early 2014, former Bloomberg anchor Susan Li joined CNBC Asia and replaced Lisa Oake (who left CNBC Asia at the end of 2013) as co-anchor of ''Asia Squawk Box.''

===2014-present===
On 31 March 2014, the show launched with a new live set in Hong Kong and moved back to the 7-10am SIN/HK timeslot.  Susan Li and Bernard Lo became the new co-anchors of ''Asia Squawk Box,'' which is now based in Hong Kong.  Martin Soong, who had been co-anchor from 2005–14, moved to a new program, ''Street Signs'' (which also shares the same name as its now-defunct US counterpart).  That program is co-anchored by Soong and [[Oriel Morrison]] (the latter who herself had previously been anchor of ''Cash Flow'', which was cancelled 28 March 2014).

On 9 February 2015, ''Asia Squawk Box'' debuted a new logo that is used by its US counterpart since 13 October 2014, but the theme music was originally not the same as its US and Europe versions.  That changed 27 April 2015, when the Asia version started using the same theme music as its US and Europe versions.

In mid-August 2015, the show briefly launched again in the Singapore Exchange studio after Susan Li left CNBC Asia to join its sister network in Europe as co-anchor of ''[[Worldwide Exchange]]''.  On 26 October 2015, Lo became the sole anchor of ''Asia Squawk Box'', which is once again based in Hong Kong.

On 8 February 2016, both the Asian and European versions started using the remastered ''Squawk Box'' logo that has been used by their US counterpart since 4 January 2016.

On 3 July 2017, Singapore-based anchor Oriel Morrison joined ''Asia Squawk Box'' as co-anchor of the show's third hour.

In February 2018, Akiko Fujita (formerly of ''[[The Rundown (CNBC Asia)|The Rundown]]'', which was based in Singapore) joined Lo in Hong Kong as co-anchor.

On 29 October 2018, ''Asia Squawk Box'' once again moved back to the previous 6-9am SIN/HK timeslot following the cancellation of ''The Rundown'' three days prior.

==Facts==
*Maria Bartiromo, who was part of the original [[Squawk Box|''US Squawk Box'']] team until the mid-2000s, was a guest co-anchor on ''ASB'' in 2006.  She was also a regular on ''ASB'' from late 2000 to early 2002 when the U.S. reverts to standard time from daylight saving time (late-October to March of the following year) to recap the US trading day.  At other times of the year, she appeared on the now canceled ''CNBC Today'' and ''Asia Wake Up Call''.  Bartiromo left CNBC at the end of November 2013.

'''Bjørn Erlend Dæhlie''' (born 19 June 1967) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[businessman]] and retired [[cross-country skiing|cross-country skier]]. In the years from 1992 to 1999, Dæhlie won the Nordic World Cup six times, finishing second in 1994 and 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/08/sports/plus-winter-sports-cross-country-norway-s-daehlie-clinches-world-cup.html |title= WINTER SPORTS -- CROSS-COUNTRY; Norway's Daehlie Clinches World Cup |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= 8 March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dæhlie won a total of 29 medals in the Olympics and World Championships in the period between 1991 and 1999, making Dæhlie the most successful male cross-country skier in history.

During his career, Dæhlie measured a [[Vo2 max|VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max]] of 96 ml/kg/min.&lt;ref&gt;http://sport.aftenbladet.no/sport/sykkel/article250793.ece {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dæhlie's result was achieved out of season, and physiologist Erlend Hem who was responsible for the testing stated that he would not discount the possibility of the skier passing 100 ml/kg/min at his absolute peak.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In addition to being an athletic figurehead, Dæhlie is a cultural icon in Norway. Since retiring, Dæhlie has become a successful businessman in real estate and fashion. His real estate investments have produced a fortune of more than half a billion&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dn.no/dnaktiv/2018/08/09/1042/Langrenn/bjorn-daehlie-har-doblet-formuen-pa-fem-ar&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norwegian kroner|kroner]]. Dæhlie has been featured in [[advertising]] campaigns, he started a brand of signature ski apparel, and he co-hosted a [[television]] show called ''[[Gutta på tur]]''. Dæhlie also invented the [[Ski bindings#Cross country|Salomon Nordic System Pilot Bindings]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Early life and career==
Born in [[Elverum]], [[Norway]], Dæhlie later moved to [[Nannestad]], where he settled down. Dæhlie attributes much of his success in sports to his upbringing where he was active in [[hunting]], [[fishing]], [[hiking]], [[kayaking]], [[association football|football]] and of course, [[skiing]] from a very early age. For much of his childhood Dæhlie wanted to be a football player, but after being prompted by a coach, he tried Nordic skiing. Dæhlie did not have immediate success as a junior racer, but he consistently improved and eventually qualified for the [[International Ski Federation|FIS]] World Cup competitions.

==Athletic career==
Bjørn Dæhlie was first on the Norwegian skiing team for the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in Calgary, Canada. However, he did not participate in any races and was there to learn from more senior skiers. He later claimed these Olympics were the turning point for Norwegian skiing before their following period of success.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aftenposten.no/fakta/Det-har-gatt-helt-som-smurt-6534883.html {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in the world cup in January 1989, finishing 11th on 15&amp;nbsp;km freestyle in Kavgolovo. In December the same year, he won his first world cup race. He finished first on the 15&amp;nbsp;km freestyle, the first world cup race of the season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrk.no/sport/bjorn-daehlie-1.4759992 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1991]] in Val di Fiemme, Dæhlie won his first World Championship gold medal. He beat skiing legend [[Gunde Svan]] on the 15&amp;nbsp;km freestyle. The medal was unexpected, since Dæhlie was young and still unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Aftenposten, 10 February 1991 (Norwegian newspaper)&lt;/ref&gt; It was Norway's first individual gold medal in the World Championships since [[Oddvar Brå]] won gold in the same race in Oslo in 1982. Dæhlie also skied the last leg on the winning 4x10 km relay team.

In 1992, Dæhlie's period of dominance started. He won the world cup overall for the first time, a feat he would accomplish five more times in the next seven years. In [[1992 Winter Olympics|Albertville]] Dæhlie won his first Olympic medals. He won gold in 10/15&amp;nbsp;km freestyle pursuit, 50&amp;nbsp;km freestyle and was on the winning team for the 4x10 km relay. He won a silver in 30&amp;nbsp;km classical style. Dæhlie also finished fourth on the 10&amp;nbsp;km freestyle, where his teammate [[Vegard Ulvang]] won the gold. Dæhlie completed the 4th leg of the relay, and crossed the finishing line backwards, having won by a margin of over one and a half minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/23/sports/winter-olympics-italians-silence-norsemen-in-relay.html |title= WINTER OLYMPICS; Italians Silence Norsemen In Relay |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= 23 February 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dæhlie and Ulvang completed a clean sweep of the cross-country skiing gold medals, each winning three golds and a silver. Dæhlie was awarded Fearnley's Olympic Prize for his performance, a prize given to the best performing Norwegian athlete in the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idrett.no/tema/utmerkelser/Sider/Fearnleysolympiske.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216162922/http://www.idrett.no/tema/utmerkelser/Sider/Fearnleysolympiske.aspx |archivedate=2014-12-16 |df= }} {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1994 Winter Olympics]] in Lillehammer, Norway, Dæhlie won gold in the 10&amp;nbsp;km classical style and the 15&amp;nbsp;km freestyle pursuit. He won silver in the 30&amp;nbsp;km freestyle, where he was beaten by [[Thomas Alsgaard]]. The 4x10 km relay was a very tight race between Norway and Italy. The Italians won the gold after [[Silvio Fauner]] beat Dæhlie on the sprint on the last leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-23/sports/sp-26005_1_cross-country-ski-racing |title= '94 Winter Lillehammer Olympics : Italians Sneak a Victory : Nordic skiing: The strong Norwegian team is overcome near the finish in the men's 40k cross-country relay |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |date= 23 February 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, Thomas Alsgaard took over the 4th leg on the Norwegian relay team with Dæhlie skiing the 3rd leg, since Alsgaard was the better sprinter.

The [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1997|1997 Skiing World Championships]] were Dæhlie's most successful World Championships. In front of the home crowd in Trondheim he won a medal in every race, taking gold in the 10&amp;nbsp;km classical race, the 10+15&amp;nbsp;km combined pursuit and the 4x10 km relay. In addition he won a silver in the 30&amp;nbsp;km freestyle and bronze in the 50&amp;nbsp;km classical. Dæhlie said the championships were like "Lillehammer all over again" and that "For me, it's very special to compete in Norway".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/events/1998/nagano/athletes/159.htm |title= Athlete profile: Bjorn Daehlie |publisher= [[CNN Sports Illustrated]] |date= 3 February 1998 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060505080646/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/events/1998/nagano/athletes/159.htm |archivedate= 5 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dæhlie won three golds and one silver in his last Olympics in [[1998 Winter Olympics|Nagano]]. He won the 10&amp;nbsp;km classical style, the 50&amp;nbsp;km freestyle and the 4x10 km skiing relay. In the 15&amp;nbsp;km freestyle pursuit, he got a silver medal having been beaten by Thomas Alsgaard on the sprint. Dæhlie won the 50&amp;nbsp;km freestyle ahead of [[Niklas Jonsson]] by only eight seconds. Both skiers collapsed on the finishing line, having given everything in pursuit of victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.shinmai.co.jp/oly-eng/19980222/0003.htm |title= Daehlie wins 50-km cross country for 3rd Nagano gold |newspaper= The Shinano Mainichi Shimbun |date= 22 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dæhlie described the race as his hardest race ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/29/sports/olympics-still-burning-to-compete-daehlie-looks-to-2002-games.html |title= OLYMPICS; Still Burning To Compete, Daehlie Looks To 2002 Games |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= 29 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dæhlie also formed a lasting friendship with [[Phillip Boit]], the Kenyan skier. Dæhlie waited for Boit on the finish line for 20 minutes following the 10&amp;nbsp;km race, saying Boit deserved encouragement.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/winter_olympics_98/cross_country_skiing/55856.stm&lt;/ref&gt;  Philip went on to name one of his children Dæhlie Boit.

Dæhlie was planning to compete in the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City, but he was prevented from participating by a career-ending [[roller skiing]] accident in August 1999. The resulting back injury prevented Dæhlie from adding more medals to his collection. He retired from the sport in March 2001, having tried extensive rehabilitation and surgery to come back.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2001/03/29/250122.html {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His decision to retire shocked the nation of Norway, where Dæhlie was idolized for his great winning record.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrk.no/sport/bjorn-daehlie-1.4759992 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dæhlie's eight Olympic titles are a record for the [[Winter Olympics]], as are his total of 12 Olympic medals (he also won four silver medals) which he amassed in three Olympics ([[1992 Winter Olympics|Albertville]], [[1994 Winter Olympics|Lillehammer]] and [[1998 Winter Olympics|Nagano]]). In addition to his achievements at the Olympics he had great success in the [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships|World Championships]] where he won 17 medals of which 9 were gold medals. He was particularly successful in the [[Trondheim]] [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1997|1997 World Championships]], where he earned medals in all five events. Despite his unanticipated early exit from the sport, Dæhlie is considered by many to be one of the greatest Winter Olympic athletes of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Athletes/All-Athletes/Athletes-DA-to-DM/-BJORN-DAEHLIE-/ |title= Björn Dæhlie |website= Olympic.org |publisher= [[International Olympic Committee]] |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101213032540/http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Athletes/All-Athletes/Athletes-DA-to-DM/-BJORN-DAEHLIE-/ |archivedate= 2010-12-13 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his illustrious career, Dæhlie never won a race at the [[Holmenkollen ski festival]], but he was still awarded the [[Holmenkollen medal]] in 1997 (shared with [[Bjarte Engen Vik]] and [[Stefania Belmondo]]).

In 2016, Marshall gained notoriety after WikiLeaks published an email in which he questioned the faith of the [[Jewish]] candidate for the Democratic nomination, [[Bernie Sanders]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He wrote: "It might may [sic] no difference, but for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief.  Does he believe in a God. [sic]  He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage.  I think I read he is an atheist.  This could make several points difference with my peeps.

{{Capitalism}}

In [[economics]], '''capital''' consists of an asset that can enhance one's power to perform economically useful work. For example, in a fundamental sense a stone or an arrow is capital for a caveman who can use it as a hunting instrument, while roads are capital for inhabitants of a city.

[[Adam Smith]] defines capital as "That part of men's stock which he expects to afford him revenue".  The term "stock" is derived from the Old English word for stump or tree trunk. It has been used to refer to all the moveable property of a farm since at least 1510.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=stock | title = Online Etymology Dictionary | publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Capital goods''', '''real capital''', or [[capital asset]]s are already-produced, [[durable good]]s or any non-financial asset that is used in [[Production (economics)|production]] of [[good (economics)|goods]] or [[Service (economics)|services]].&lt;ref name="Boulding"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boulding|first1=Kenneth E.|title=Capital and interest|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/capital-economics|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=July 22, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capital is distinct from land (or [[non-renewable resources]]) in that capital can be increased by human labor.  At any given moment in time, total [[physical capital]] may be referred to as the '''capital stock''' (which is not to be confused with the [[stock|capital stock]] of a business entity).

Capital is an input in the [[production function]].  Homes and personal autos are not usually defined as capital but as durable goods because they are not used in a production of saleable goods and services.

In [[Marxian economics|Marxian political economy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/a.htm#capital | title=Definition of Capital on Marxists.org | author= | date= | work= Encyclopedia of Marxism| publisher=Marxism.org | accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; capital is money used to buy something only in order to sell it again to realize a financial profit. For Marx capital only exists within the process of economic exchange—it is [[wealth]] that grows out of the process of circulation itself, and for Marx it formed the basis of the economic system of [[capitalism]]. In more contemporary schools of economics, this form of capital is generally referred to as "[[financial capital]]" and is distinguished from "[[capital good]]s".

==In narrow and broad uses==
[[Classical economics|Classical]] and [[neoclassical economics]] regard capital as one of the [[factors of production]] (alongside the other factors: [[land (economics)|land]] and [[labour (economics)|labour]]).  All other inputs to production are called [[intangibles (disambiguation)|intangibles]] in classical economics.  This includes organization, [[entrepreneurship]], knowledge, goodwill, or management (which some characterize as [[Aptitude|talent]], [[social capital]] or [[instructional capital]]).

This is what makes it a factor of production:
* The good is not used up immediately in the process of production unlike raw materials or [[intermediate good]]s.  (The significant exception to this is [[depreciation]] allowance, which like intermediate goods, is treated as a business expense.)
* The good can be produced or increased (in contrast to land and [[non-renewable resources]]).

These distinctions of convenience have carried over to contemporary economic theory.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Paul A. Samuelson]] and [[William Nordhaus|William D. Nordhaus]] (2004). ''[[Economics (textbook)|Economics]]'', 18th ed.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Glossary of Terms, "Capital (capital goods, capital equipment)."&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Deardorff's Glossary of International Economics, [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/c.html#capital Capital.]
&lt;/ref&gt;
There was{{when|date=March 2014}} the further clarification that capital is a [[Stock and flow|stock]].  As such, its value can be estimated at a point in time.  By contrast, [[Investment#In economics or macroeconomics|investment]], as production to be added to the capital stock, is described as taking place over time ("per year"), thus a [[Stock and flow|flow]].

[[Marxian economics]] distinguishes between different forms of capital:
* [[constant capital]], which refers to capital goods
* [[variable capital]], which refers to labor-inputs, where the cost is "variable" based on the amount of wages and salaries are paid throughout the duration of an employee's contract/employment,
* [[fictitious capital]], which refers to intangible representations or abstractions of physical capital, such as stocks, bonds and securities (or "tradable [[Paper wealth|paper claims to wealth]]")

Earlier illustrations often described capital as physical items, such as tools, buildings, and vehicles that are used in the production process.  Since at least the 1960s economists have increasingly focused on broader forms of capital.  For example, investment in skills and education can be viewed as building up [[human capital]] or [[knowledge capital]], and investments in [[intellectual property]] can be viewed as building up [[intellectual capital]].  These terms lead to certain questions and controversies discussed in those articles.

== Modern types of capital ==

Detailed classifications of capital that have been used in various theoretical or applied uses generally respect the following division:
* [[Financial capital]], which represents obligations, and is liquidated as money for trade, and owned by legal entities. It is in the form of capital assets, traded in financial markets. Its market value is not based on the historical accumulation of money invested but on the perception by the market of its expected revenues and of the risk entailed.
* [[Natural capital]], which is inherent in ecologies and which increases the supply of human wealth
* [[Social capital]], which in private enterprise is partly captured as [[goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] or [[brand value]], but is a more general concept of inter-relationships between human beings having money-like value that motivates actions in a similar fashion to paid compensation.
* [[Instructional capital]], defined originally in academia as that aspect of teaching and knowledge transfer that is not inherent in individuals or social relationships but transferrable.  ''Various theories use names like [[knowledge]] or [[intellectual capital]] to describe similar concepts but these are not strictly defined as in the academic definition and have no widely agreed accounting treatment.''
* [[Human capital]], a broad term that generally includes social, instructional and individual human [[Aptitude|talent]] in combination.  ''It is used in technical economics to define “balanced growth”, which is the goal of improving human capital as much as economic capital.
* [[Public capital]] is a blanket term that attempts to characterize physical capital that is considered [[infrastructure]] and which supports production in unclear or poorly accounted ways.  This encompasses the aggregate body of all government-owned assets that are used to promote private industry productivity, including highways, railways, airports, water treatment facilities, telecommunications, electric grids, energy utilities, municipal buildings, public hospitals and schools, police, fire protection, courts and still others.  However it is a problematic term insofar as many of these assets can be either publicly or privately owned.

Separate literatures have developed to describe both [[natural capital]] and [[social capital]].  Such terms reflect a wide [[consensus]] that nature and society both function in such a similar manner as traditional industrial infrastructural capital, that it is entirely appropriate to refer to them as different types of capital in themselves.  In particular, they can be used in the production of other goods, are not used up immediately in the process of production, and can be enhanced (if not created) by human effort.

There is also a literature of [[intellectual capital]] and [[intellectual property law]].  However, this increasingly distinguishes means of capital investment, and collection of potential rewards for [[patent]], [[copyright]] (creative or [[individual capital]]), and [[trademark]] (social trust or [[social capital]]) instruments.

==Interpretations==

Economist [[Henry George]] argued that financial instruments like stocks, bonds, mortgages, promissory notes, or other certificates for transferring wealth is not really capital.  Because "Their economic value merely represents the power of one class to appropriate the earnings of another" and "their increase or decrease does not affect the sum of wealth in the community".&lt;ref name="Drake, 2006"&gt;{{cite web|last1=George|first1=Henry|title=Progress and Poverty, Chapter 2|url=http://www.henrygeorge.org/pchp2.htm|website=www.henrygeorge.org|publisher=Bob Drake|accessdate=July 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some thinkers, such as [[Werner Sombart]] and [[Max Weber]], locate the concept of capital as originating in [[double-entry bookkeeping]], which is thus a foundational innovation in [[capitalism]], Sombart writing in "Medieval and Modern Commercial Enterprise" that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}} (quoted in [http://www.dse.unive.it/summerschool/course2007/accounting%20and%20rationality.pdf "Accounting and rationality"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722064638/http://www.dse.unive.it/summerschool/course2007/accounting%20and%20rationality.pdf |date=2011-07-22 }})&lt;/ref&gt;
:The very concept of capital is derived from this way of looking at things; one can say that capital, as a category, did not exist before double-entry bookkeeping. Capital can be defined as that amount of wealth which is used in making profits and which enters into the accounts."

Within classical economics, [[Adam Smith]] (''Wealth of Nations'', Book II, Chapter 1) distinguished [[fixed capital]] from [[circulating capital]]. The former designated physical assets not consumed in the production of a product (e.g. machines and storage facilities), while the latter referred to physical assets consumed in the process of production (e.g. raw materials and intermediate products).  For an enterprise, both were types of capital.

[[Karl Marx]] adds a distinction that is often confused with [[David Ricardo|David Ricardo's]]. In [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] theory, [[constant capital#Variable capital|variable capital]] refers to a capitalist's investment in labor-power, seen as the only source of [[surplus-value]]. It is called "variable" since the amount of [[labor theory of value|value]] it can produce varies from the amount it consumes, ''i.e.'', it creates new value. On the other hand, [[constant capital]] refers to investment in non-human factors of production, such as plant and machinery, which Marx takes to contribute only its own [[replacement value]] to the commodities it is used to produce.

[[Investment]] or [[capital accumulation]], in classical economic theory, is the production of increased capital. Investment requires that some goods be produced that are not immediately consumed, but instead used to produce other goods as [[capital goods]].  Investment is closely related to [[saving]], though it is not the same. As [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]] pointed out, saving involves not spending all of one's income on current goods or services, while investment refers to spending on a specific type of goods, ''i.e.'', capital goods.

[[Austrian School]] economist [[Eugen Boehm von Bawerk]] maintained that [[capital intensity]] was measured by the [[roundaboutness]] of production processes. Since capital is defined by him as being goods of higher-order, or goods used to produce consumer goods, and derived their value from them, being future goods.

[[Human development theory]] describes human capital as being composed of distinct social, imitative and creative elements:
* [[Social capital]] is the value of network trusting relationships between individuals in an economy.
* [[Individual capital]], which is inherent in persons, protected by societies, and trades labour for trust or money. Close parallel concepts are "[[skill|talent]]", "[[ingenuity]]", "[[leadership]]", "trained bodies", or "innate skills" that cannot reliably be reproduced by using any combination of any of the others above.  In traditional economic analysis individual capital is more usually called ''labour''.
* [[Instructional capital]] in the academic sense is clearly separate from either individual persons or social bonds between them.
This theory is the basis of [[triple bottom line]] accounting and is further developed in [[ecological economics]], [[welfare economics]] and the various theories of [[green economics]].  All of which use a particularly abstract notion of capital in which the requirement of capital being produced like durable goods is effectively removed.

The [[Cambridge capital controversy]] was a dispute between economists at Cambridge, Massachusetts based MIT and University of Cambridge in the UK about the measurement of capital. The Cambridge, UK economists, including [[Joan Robinson]] and [[Piero Sraffa]] claimed that there is no basis for aggregating the heterogeneous objects that constitute 'capital goods.'

Political economists [[Jonathan Nitzan]] and [[Shimshon Bichler]] have suggested that capital is not a productive entity, but solely financial and that capital values measure the relative power of owners over the broad social processes that bear on profits.&lt;ref&gt;''Capital as Power: A Study of Order and Creorder'', Routledge, 2009, p, 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Civic Center''' neighborhood of [[Los Angeles, California]], is the administrative core of the [[Los Angeles, California|City of Los Angeles]], County of Los Angeles, and a complex of [[city]], county, [[U.S. state|state]], and [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] government offices, buildings, and courthouses.

==Location==
[[File:View of Los Angeles Civic Center from Dodger Stadium, Los Angeles, California.jpg|thumbnail|left|View of the Civic Center from [[Dodger Stadium]].]]
The Civic Center is located in the northern part of [[Downtown Los Angeles]], bordering [[Bunker Hill, Los Angeles, California|Bunker Hill]], [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, California|Little Tokyo]], [[Chinatown, Los Angeles, California|Chinatown]], and the [[Historic Core, Los Angeles, California|Historic Core]] of the old Downtown. Depending on various district definitions, either the Civic Center or [[Bunker Hill, Los Angeles, California|Bunker Hill]] also contains the [[Los Angeles Music Center|Music Center]] and adjacent [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]]; some maps, for example, place the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] in the Civic Center but the Disney Concert Hall in Bunker Hill.

The Civic Center has the distinction of containing the largest concentration of government employees in the United States outside of [[Washington, DC|Washington, D.C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtownlawalks.com/?f=Civic_Center|title=Civic Center|work=Downtown LA Walks|accessdate=1 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226092055/http://www.downtownlawalks.com/?f=Civic_Center|archivedate=26 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the high concentration is simple: Los Angeles is the most populous county in the United States and its second largest city, and houses several state and federal functions for the region.

==Transportation==
The Civic Center is served by numerous [[LACMTA|Metro]] buses, most of which run to adjacent [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]], the [[Hollywood Freeway|101]] and [[California State Route 110|110]] [[freeways]], and the Metro [[Red Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Red Line]] and [[Purple Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Purple Line]]'s [[Civic Center (LACMTA Station)|Civic Center/Grand Park Station]] are also in the vicinity. [[OCTA]], [[Foothill Transit]], [[Los Angeles Department of Transportation#DASH|DASH shuttles]], [[Los Angeles Department of Transportation#Commuter Express|Commuter Express]] and other municipal bus lines also serve the area. 

The [[Regional Connector Transit Corridor|Regional Connector]], currently under construction, will serve this area with two stations at Second/Flower and Second/Broadway station.

==Development==
The Civic Center area is part of the ongoing [[Grand Avenue Project]], which aims to develop existing parking lots in the area for residential and commercial use as well as create a [[Grand Park]] between the [[Los Angeles Music Center]] and [[Los Angeles City Hall|City Hall]].

In March 2017, the Los Angeles City Council approved a new Civic Center Master Plan. It details a full build out around city hall by the year 2032, specifically the east facing front. The CCMP schedules for a full tear down of [[Parker Center]], L.A. City Hall's "south" building, and the Los Angeles Mall. The CCMP is to connect City Hall with its surrounding neighborhood and [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles|Little Tokyo]]. 

The CCMP calls for active ground-floor uses, to stimulate the pedestrian traffic that the Civic Center currently lacks. Four new government and office towers are described in the plan as well as the planned [[Park 101]] recreational area. A design approach idea to cover U.S. Highway 101 as a trench with green space above. Connecting with [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]] and [[Olvera Street]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urbanize.la/post/look-civic-center-future|title=A Look at the Civic Center of the Future|date=5 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3685">[[File:Assassination attempt on Hendrik Verwoerd 2.jpg|thumb|David Pratt is overpowered after he shoots [[Hendrik Verwoerd]]]]
'''David Beresford Pratt''' (1 October 1908 – 1 October 1961) was a South African businessman who shot [[South Africa|South African]] [[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister]] [[Hendrik Verwoerd]] in 1960. Verwoerd survived, but was killed six years later by [[Dimitri Tsafendas]].

==Life==
Pratt was a wealthy businessman and farmer of British descent. He qualified as a chartered accountant at the [[University of Cambridge]], [[England]]. He suffered from epilepsy from an early age and was a loner at school. Both of Pratt's marriages failed. There is evidence that he suffered from his first serious bout of depression in 1946 after his divorce from Mary Hatrick. His second marriage, to Patty van Heijningen, was not successful either.  

In 1954, shortly after the birth of their first child, Pratt claimed to have received a message which he should convey to South Africa. He was boarded and diagnosed as suffering from “grandiose delusions of the political saviour type”. Pratt was almost constantly in psychiatric treatment. His Dutch wife feared for her safety because he threatened her. In the beginning of 1958 she left him and returned to [[The Hague]], taking their two children with her. He followed her with a gun in his pocket but was apprehended at [[Amsterdam Airport]]. His condition worsened and he became manic. His neurologist, Dr.Chesler, urged his sister to have a ''curator bonis'' (legal guardian) appointed for him because he could no longer manage his affairs properly. He desperately tried to win his wife back. When that failed, he attempted to kidnap his little daughter during a ski holiday. As he became more desperate about his marital problems, Pratt tried to commit suicide on three different occasions.  It appears that Pratt’s paranoid condition was reinforced by the escalation of the political conflict after the [[Sharpeville massacre]].

==Assassination attempt==

On 9 April 1960, Pratt shot South African Prime Minister [[Hendrik Verwoerd]] twice, at point blank range, with a .22 pistol. Verwoerd, who had been opening the Union Exposition in Milner Park, Johannesburg, was rushed to hospital, and within two months had made a complete recovery. Pratt was arrested at the scene and taken to the Marshall Square police station, and then to the Forensic Medical Laboratory. He appeared for a preliminary hearing in the Johannesburg Magistrates' Court on 20 and 21 July 1960, once it was clear that the Verwoerd's injuries were not fatal.

Pratt claimed he had been shooting 'the epitome of [[apartheid]]'. The court accepted the medical reports submitted to it by five different psychiatrists, all of which confirmed that Pratt lacked legal capacity and could not be held criminally liable for having shot the prime minister. On 26 September 1960, he was committed to a mental hospital in [[Bloemfontein]].

==Death==
On the first of October 1961, his fifty-third birthday, and shortly before his parole was to be considered, he committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Loammi (2012).

==History==
EBA Clearing was founded in June 1998 by the [[Euro Banking Association]] (EBA) and is owned by the major payment banks operating in Europe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebaclearing.eu/about-eba-clearing/at-a-glance/the-company/|title=About EBA CLEARING|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ebaclearing.eu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thepaypers.com/payments-general/eba-clearing-irish-payment-services-organisation-launch-step2-irish-service/745492-27 |title=EBA Clearing, Irish Payment Services Organisation launch STEP2 Irish service |date=October 12, 2011 |publisher=ThePaypers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its initial mission was to create and operate the clearing and settlement system for high value euro transactions, [[#EURO1|EURO1]], which the EBA had transferred to EBA Clearing at the launch of the [[Eurosystem]] in 1999. Besides EURO1, EBA Clearing also owns and operates [[#STEP1|STEP1]], a payment system for single euro payments for small and medium-sized banks, and [[#STEP2|STEP2]], a [[Pan-European Automated Clearing House]] (PE-ACH) for Euro-denominated retail payments. In March 2013, EBA CLEARING launched [[#MyBank|MyBank]], an e-authorisation solution for online payments, which is geared at facilitating the growth of e-commerce across Europe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In October 2017, banks from nine countries agreed to join RT1, EBA Clearing’s pan-European infrastructure for [[instant payments]] in Euro, on its go-live date in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://ibsintelligence.com/eba-clearing-joined-coalition-banks-instant-payments/ |title=EBA Clearing joined by coalition of banks for instant payments |date=October 11, 2017 |publisher=IBS Intelligence }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bankingtech.com/1033172/instant-payments-in-europe-moving-from-theory-to-practice/ |date=17 October 2017 |title=Instant payments in Europe: moving from theory to practice |publisher=Banking Technology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Payment systems==

=== EURO1 ===
EURO1 is a [[Real-time gross settlement|RTGS-equivalent]] large-value payment system that settles single Euro transactions of high priority and urgency, and primarily of large amount. EURO1 operates on a multilateral net basis, meaning that it continuously adjusts the accounts of the participant banks as they make payments for each other's customers.  EURO1&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ebaclearing.eu/services/euro1/overview/|title=EURO1|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ebaclearing.eu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; is owned and operated by EBA Clearing. It is open to banks that have a registered address or branch in the [[European Union]] and fulfil a number of additional requirements. EURO1 is subject to German law (current account principle/single obligation structure) and is based on a messaging and IT infrastructure provided by [[SWIFT]].

=== STEP1 ===
Since 2000, EBA Clearing has been offering a payment service named STEP1&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ebaclearing.eu/services/step1/overview/ |title=STEP1|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ebaclearing.eu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; for small and medium-sized banks for single euro payments of high priority and urgency. The technical infrastructure is the same as that of the EURO1 system, both use the messaging and IT infrastructure of SWIFT.

=== STEP2 ===
STEP2 was put into operation in 2003 with Italian [[payment system]] provider [[SIA S.p.A.]] It processes mass payments in [[euro]]. STEP2 is a [[pan-European automated clearing house]] (PE-ACH).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebaclearing.eu/services/step2-t-platform/overview/|title=STEP2-T Platform|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ebaclearing.eu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that it complies with the principles set by the [[European Payments Council]] (EPC) for a PE-ACH Compliant Clearing and Settlement System.

From the beginning of [[Single Euro Payments Area]] (SEPA) on 28 January 2008, STEP2 has been offering SEPA Credit Transfer processing services across all SEPA countries through its SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT) Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebaclearing.eu/services/step2-sct/overview/|title=SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT) Service|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ebaclearing.eu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2 November 2009, the transposition date of the [[Payment Services Directive]], EBA Clearing has been processing SEPA Direct Debits with its STEP2 SDD Core&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebaclearing.eu/services/step2-sdd-core/overview/|title=STEP2 SDD Core Service|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ebaclearing.eu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and STEP2 [[SEPA Direct Debit]] ("[[Business-to-business|Business to Business]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebaclearing.eu/services/step2-sdd-b2b/overview/|title=SEPA Direct Debit ("Business to Business") Service|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ebaclearing.eu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Services.

Through its SEPA Credit Transfer and Direct Debit offerings, STEP2 provides banks across Europe with one channel through which they can send and receive their SEPA Credit Transfers and SEPA Direct Debits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Golden |date=April 23, 2015 |url=https://www.euromoney.com/article/b1321vvm42d0lg/cash-management-debate-sepa-a-new-model-for-europe |title=Cash management debate: SEPA: A new model for Europe?|website=Euromoney}}&lt;/ref&gt; The STEP2 platform reaches nearly 100 percent of all banks that have signed the SCT and SDD Scheme Adherence Agreements of the [[European Payments Council]] (EPC).

=== MyBank ===
MyBank is a pan-European e-authorisation solution for online payments that was launched in March 2013 by EBA Clearing. The solution enables customers across Europe to pay for their online purchases via their regular online or mobile banking environment without having to disclose confidential data to the merchant or other third parties. The solution can be used for authorising SEPA Credit Transfers as well as the creation of SDD mandates. At a later stage, MyBank may also be used for transactions in currencies other than euro or for e-identity services.

Today, MyBank is owned and managed by PRETA S.A.S., a wholly owned subsidiary of EBA Clearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mybank.eu/mybank/preta-sas/|title=PRETA Sas - MyBank|website=www.mybank.eu|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RT1 ===
RT1 is an [[instant payment]] system that will provide the European payments industry with a pan-European infrastructure platform for real-time payments in euro from day one of the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer Scheme. From 21 November 2017, the RT1 fast payment system will begin operations, allowing commercial banks to offer fast payments through this system to their customers throughout the Eurozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Yuri |last=Kantsans |url=http://baltnews.lv/news/20171028/1021274777.html |title=Банк Латвии готовится к введению молниеносных платежей в европейском масштабе |trans-title=The Bank of Latvia is preparing to introduce lightning-fast payments on a European scale |date=28 October 2017 |publisher=[[Baltnews|baltnews.lv]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kemper gained some [[List of Internet phenomena|Internet fame]] in August 2007 for her part in "Blowjob Girl", a humor video on the sketch comedy site [[Derrick Comedy]]. The video, which was circulated on the popular site [[CollegeHumor]], was a two-minute close-up of Kemper offering to perform [[oral sex]] on her boyfriend, but startling him by promising to bite and smash his genitals, which she seems to believe is arousing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=I'm Gonna Make it Sooo Dry For You... |work=AmFmPm |date=May 7, 2007 |url=http://www.amfmpm.org/2007/07/blowjobs-blowjob-right.html |accessdate=June 1, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924031130/http://www.amfmpm.org/2007/07/blowjobs-blowjob-right.html |archive-date=2009-09-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kemper said of the video in an April 2010 interview with ''[[The A.V.

Kemper auditioned for a role in ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', an [[NBC]] comedy series started in 2009 by [[Michael Schur]] and [[Greg Daniels]], creator of the series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]''. She was not cast in the role, but received a call back to audition for a supporting role in ''The Office'' as [[Erin Hannon]], a secretary filling in for the regular secretary [[Pam Beesly]] when she briefly left the job at the end of the [[The Office (US TV series) season 5|fifth season]]. Kemper was cast in the role, and started appearing in the show in April 2009. The character was originally written to be more sarcastic and dry, but the writers changed her to be more perky and optimistic to more closely resemble Kemper herself. Kemper described the character as "an exaggerated version of myself".&lt;ref name="SLPD1213" /&gt; Kemper described herself as a "huge fan" of the show and was thrilled to be on it.&lt;ref name="Princeton" /&gt; Although the character was originally intended for four episodes, the producers were impressed with Kemper and signed her as a regular in the [[The Office (US TV series) season 6|sixth season]].&lt;ref name="SLPD1213" /&gt; [[Jennifer Celotta]], a screenwriter with the series, described Kemper as a "fun addition" to the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title="Company Picnic" Q&amp;A with Jen Celotta |work=OfficeTally |url=http://www.officetally.com/company-picnic-qa-with-jen-celotta |date=May 22, 2009 |accessdate=May 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kemper received positive reviews for her role in ''The Office''. Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', praised the "infectious joy and sweetness" she brought to the show.&lt;ref name="SLPD1213" /&gt; Joshua Ostroff of ''[[Eye Weekly]]'' described Erin as one of the best new television characters of the 2008–2009 season and said, "Erin's high-grade adorability, up-for-anything attitude and sheer niceness is unlike anyone else in the office, adding a welcome new wrinkle for next season."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Ostroff |first=Joshua |title=Leaders of the New School: Great performances in the margins brought a so-so season to life |date=May 20, 2009 |work=[[Eye Weekly]] |url=http://www.eyeweekly.com/film/tv/article/60934--leaders-of-the-new-school |accessdate=May 23, 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Shaw of ''TV Fodder'' said she "adds some freshness to the cast"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Shaw |first=Andy |title=The Office: "Cafe Disco" |work=TV Fodder |date=May 7, 2009 |url=http://www.tvfodder.com/office/archives/2009/05/cafe_disco.shtml |accessdate=May 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Josh McAuliffe of ''[[The Times-Tribune (Scranton)|The Times-Tribune]]'' in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], Pennsylvania, said he liked Erin's "cheerful, appealingly goofy personality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=McAuliffe |first=Josh |title="Cafe Disco" Recap |work=[[The Times-Tribune (Scranton)|The Times-Tribune]] |location=[[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], Pennsylvania |date=May 8, 2009 |url=http://community.thetimes-tribune.com/blogs/theoffice/archive/2009/05/08/quot-cafe-disco-quot-recap.aspx |accessdate=May 8, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics have singled her out as a highlight of the show's [[The Office (U.S. season 8)|eighth season]] following [[Steve Carell]]'s departure.&lt;ref name=avclub&gt;{{cite web |last=Myles |first=McNutt |title=Tallahassee |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/tallahassee,69358/ |work=The A.V.

==Early life==
After [[college]] Kinoti worked as a cashier in a hotel in [[Malindi]] and that's where his entrepreneurial journey truly began. Since he
worked in the night shift,Kinoti spent his day time buying and distributing eggs around [[Malindi]] town. A few years later, he moved to
Nairobi where he distributed milk to hotels in the city.&lt;ref name="entrepreneur"/&gt; Kinoti, grew up in [[Meru, Kenya|Meru]], where he assisted his father in the shop as a cashier after school. Kinoti has conceded that, "I started Shade System Company aged 24 with only five employees and a seed capital of Sh60,000. I saw a business gap because this sector was predominantly controlled by non-Kenyans an attestation to his humble beginnings. However, his father, a shop owner, was determined on giving the young Kinoti the best [[education]] available.

==Education==
Kinoti attended St. Martins Boarding Primary School, Abothogochi Academy, Nkubu High School and earned a Diploma in [[Business Management]] from Tsavo Park Institute.&lt;ref name="entrepreneur"/&gt;

==Business==
Eric Kinoti immersed himself into entrepreneurism completely in 2007. With a capital of just KSh 20,000 (about $200), he started
buying milk from Kinoo and [[Kiambu]] and supplying the city hotels both in [[Nairobi]] and [[Mombasa]].&lt;ref name="companies"&gt;{{cite news| title= Eric Kinoti eLearning:Entrepreneurship – How to start small and how to manage growth | date=1 September 2015| url=http://erickinoti.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With a saving of Ksh 60,000(US$600), he borrowed almost KSh2 million (US$20,000) from a [[Shylock]] in 2009, to set up Shade Systems where he ended up paying back the money with a million shillings (US$10,000) as the [[interest]]. He claims that was the worst decision he has ever made.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Shade Systems entrepreneur Eric Kinoti; I make millions but I'm not a millionaire...yet | date=8 November 2014| url= http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/evewoman/m/article/2000140749/shade-systems-entrepreneur-eric-kinoti-i-make-millions-but-i-m-not-a-millionaire-yet?articleID=2000140749&amp;story_title=shade-systems-entrepreneur-eric-kinoti-i-make-millions-but-i-m-not-a-millionaire-yet&amp;pageNo=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Kinoti sits atop five  powerful companies in Kenya and has been on Kenya's [[government]] [[delegation]] to several international economic meetings.&lt;ref name="man"&gt;{{cite news|title=Think big, start small |date=22 February 2015 |url=http://sunnewsonline.com/new/think-big-start-small |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802003039/http://sunnewsonline.com/new/think-big-start-small/ |archivedate=2015-08-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Apart from Shade systems (EA) ltd,Eric Kinoti is also a founder and director of Alma Tents Ltd, Bag Base Kenya Ltd and SafiSana Home Services Ltd.&lt;ref name="companies"/&gt; With the onset of the 2009 and 2014 came the expansion of Shade Systems to other countries such as [[Rwanda]], [[Somalia]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Southern Sudan]], [[Uganda]] and elsewhere with Kinoti being charged with business affairs in [[East]] and [[Central Africa]] region.

Kinoti has been regarded as the  Warren Buffett of Africa by the sun news &lt;ref name= "man"/&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Having gone through hard times and a lot of challenges, Kinoti's desire and dream is to [[motivate]] and [[mentor]] young entrepreneurs and start-ups to break through. He has been organizing [[workshops]] for young entrepreneurs across Africa named Entrepreneurs' Boot Camp with speakers from all parts of [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="philanthropy"&gt;{{cite news| title=TwendeMara Boot Camp is Finally Here| date=19 December 2014| url=http://www.entrepreneursbootcamp.net| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907173545/http://www.entrepreneursbootcamp.net/| archivedate=7 September 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gordon Bennett Aviation Trophy''' was an international airplane racing trophy awarded by [[James Gordon Bennett Jr.]], the American owner and publisher of the ''[[New York Herald]]'' newspaper. The trophy is one of three Gordon Bennett awards: Bennett was also the sponsor of an [[Gordon Bennett Cup (auto racing)|automobile race]] and a [[Gordon Bennett Cup (ballooning)|ballooning competition]].&lt;ref name='history'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esparacing.com/sport_pilot/air_racing_history.htm |title=Air Racing History |publisher=ESPA Racing |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='cof'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/up%20to%20WW%201/Reims%20Race.htm |title=Reims Air Race |publisher=Century of Flight |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms of the trophy competition were the same as those of the [[Schneider Trophy]]: each race was hosted by the nation which had won the preceding race, and the trophy would be won outright by the nation whose team won the race three times in succession. Accordingly, after [[Joseph Sadi-Lecointe]]'s victory in 1920 the Trophy became the permanent possession of the [[Aéro-Club de France]].&lt;ref name='history'/&gt;

==History==
[[File:James Gordon Bennett jr.jpg|thumbnail|upright|James Gordon Bennett]]
Following the success of the Gordon Bennett balloon competition, which had become the most important competition for the sport, Gordon Bennett announced a competition for powered aircraft in December 1908, commissioning a trophy from [[André Auroc]], the sculptor who had created the trophies for both the balloon and automobile competitions.  Formulation of the competition rules was entrusted to the Aéro-Club de France.&lt;ref&gt;Villard 1987, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  It was decided that each competing nation would be allowed to field a team of three competitors.

The 1909 competition was held as part of the [[Grande Semaine d'Aviation]] held at [[Reims]] in France, and consisted of 2 laps of a {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} circuit.  Like the subsequent competitions, it was not a direct race, but a time trial, with competitors taking off separately.  As aircraft became faster and their engines more reliable, the distance to be covered was increased each year.

The last competition was held in 1920 in the [[Communes of France|French communes]] of Orléans and Étampes. Unlike those held before the [[World War I|First World War]] which were over short courses marked by pylons, the competition was held between two points {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} apart because of the growing speed of aircraft. [[Joseph Sadi-Lecointe]] won in a time of 1 hour, 6 minutes and 17.2 seconds, while fellow French aviator Bernard de Roumanet finished  second in a time of 1 hour, 39 minutes and 6.9 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/212645443/Gordon-Bennett-Trophy-1920 |title=Gordon Bennett Trophy (1920) |publisher=Scribd |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1914 race was to have been held at Reims between 19 September and 28 September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1914/1914%20-%200389.html "The Gordon Bennett Aviation Race"][[Flight International|''Flight'']] 11 April 1914&lt;/ref&gt; but was cancelled due to the outbreak of the First World War. There was no contest in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1919/1919%20-%200720.html "No Gordon Bennett Contests This Year"][[Flight International|''Flight'']] 9 May 1919&lt;/ref&gt;

===1909===
[[File:Curtiss France.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Glenn Curtiss]] in his Curtiss No. 2 aircraft]]
The selection trial for the French team was held on the first day of the Grande Semaine d'Aviation.  Hampered by gusty winds and rain which turned the grass flying-field to glutinous mud, many of the twenty entrants were unable to take off and none managed to complete the necessary two laps. [[Eugène Lefebvre]], flying [[Wright Model A|Wright biplane]] put up the best performance, nearly completing the course; [[Louis Blériot]], who had managed to fly about 2.5&amp;nbsp;km in a [[Blériot XI]]  put up the next-best performance.  It was decided that the third place would be given on the basis of performance in the speed competition to be held that afternoon, and was taken by [[Hubert Latham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200517.html|title=Rheims Aviation Meeting|date=28 August 1909  |page=519  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wrights themselves had passed on an invitation to compete at Reims, though it seemed awkward since the Gordon Bennett Trophy was crowned with a large replica of a Wright Flyer. The [[Aero Club of America]], which had sponsored the Scientific American trophy won by Curtiss a year earlier, turned to him. His aircraft was not as well developed as the Wright machines and while it was more maneuverable than the European aircraft, it was not nearly as fast. Despite this disadvantage, Curtiss won in 15 minutes and 50.4 seconds. Blériot finished second place with a time of 15 minutes and 56.2 seconds, 5.8 seconds more than Curtiss.&lt;ref name='history'/&gt;&lt;ref name='cof'/&gt;

===1910===
The 1910 competition was held at the [[Belmont Park]] racetrack in [[New York (state)|New York]] as the culminating event of a week-long aviation meet.  The 5&amp;nbsp;km course marked out for the competition attracted strong criticism from the competing pilots.  [[Alfred Leblanc]], captain of the French team, described it as a death-trap because of the obstacles which would hinder any pilot trying to make an emergency landing, and a tight turn less than 30&amp;nbsp;m (100&amp;nbsp;ft) from one of the grandstands was christened "Dead Man's Corner" by the press.  However, the race proceeded as planned.&lt;ref&gt;Villard 1987, pp. 58-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Contestants were permitted to start at any time during a seven-hour period on the day of the race.  Claude Grahame-White was first to take off at 8:42, flying a Blériot XI powered by a 100&amp;nbsp;hp [[Gnome Omega|Gnome Double Omega]] and completing his first lap in 3 minutes 15 seconds. He was followed by [[Alec Ogilvie]] flying a [[Wright Model R]] at 9:08 and Alfred Leblanc at 9:20. Leblanc, who was the chief pilot for the Blériot company, was flying a 100&amp;nbsp;hp Blériot XI differing slightly from Grahame-White's, with a different propeller and a reduced wingspan. Leblanc's aircraft was clearly faster: after four laps his time was 1 minute 20 seconds better than Grahame-White's and he completed his nineteenth lap after 52 minutes 49.6 seconds in the air, Grahame -White having completed the 20 lap course in 1 hour 1 minute 4.47 seconds.  However half-way round the last lap Leblanc's engine stopped, either through fuel shortage or the breakage of a fuel line, and he had to make a forced landing, colliding with a telegraph pole but fortunately escaping serious injury.&lt;ref&gt;Villard 1987, pp.84-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Alec Ogilvie had been forced to land by engine problems after 13 laps after a delay of 54 minutes he took off again and eventually completed the course in a total time of 2h 26m 36.6s, good enough to gain him third place.

[[Walter Brookins]], flying the [[Wright Model R|Wright "Baby Grand"]], was about to take off when Leblanc crashed, and decided to fly to the scene of the accident to see if he could help.  However shortly after takeoff a connecting rod broke and his aircraft was wrecked in the subsequent forced landing.  Brooking was unhurt.&lt;ref&gt;Villart 1987, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hubert Latham]] took off at 10:59, but his attempt was plagued by engine failures, and he spent about four hours on the ground making repairs, eventually completing the course in 5h 48m 53s, an average speed of {{convert|17.8|mph|kph|disp=flip|abbr=on}}.

Shortly before the latest permitted takeoff time  [[John Armstrong Drexel|John Drexel]] and [[John Moisant]], both flying Blériot IXs, started their attempts. Drexel was forced to retire after seven laps, while Moisant completed the course in 1h 57s 44.8s after landing more than once with engine problems, securing second place.&lt;ref&gt;Villard 1987, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200919.html The American International Meeting] [[Flight International|''Flight]] 5 November 1910 p. 917&lt;/ref&gt;

===1911===
[[File:Weymann-Gordon Bennett-2.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Charles Weymann standing in front of his Nieuport monoplane]]
The 1911 race was held on 1 July at the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]]'s flying field at [[RAF Eastchurch|Eastchurch]], and attracted a crowd of around 10,000 spectators despite the comparative remoteness to the location.  Both France and Britain entered three pilots with three reserves, the British entries including a [[Bristol Prier monoplane]] to be flown by [[Grahame Gilmour]], but this was not ready in time to compete.  The competition coincided with the [[Circuit of Europe]] air race, as a result of which the British pilot [[James Valentine (aviator)|James Valentine]] withdrew: however [[Charles Weymann]], the sole American representative chose to withdraw from the Circuit of Europe to take part in the Gordon Bennett competition.

The start of the competition was delayed by poor weather, and the first competitor [[Gustav Hamel]], did not take off until 2:50 in the afternoon. Flying a [[Blériot XXIII]] monoplane which had been modified shortly before the race by having its wings cut down by about a metre (39&amp;nbsp;in), he misjudged his first turn and
crashed at high speed, astonishingly escaping without serious injury.&lt;ref&gt;Villard 1987, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;  At 3:00 Louis Chevalier, flying a [[Nieuport II]] powered by a {{convert|28|hp|kW}} Nieuport engine. After five laps his engine began showing signs of trouble and he was eventually forced to land after eleven laps, damaging his undercariage.  He then resumed his attempt flying a replacement aircraft, but this also suffered an engine failure shortly after takeoff and he was forced to withdraw.  Weymann took off at 3:45, impressing spectators by the steepness of his banked turns, shortly followed at 4:47 by Alec Ogilvie, flying the aircraft in which he had finished third the previous year, now powered by a 50&amp;nbsp;hp N.E.C engine.  Last to take off were [[Edouard Nieuport]] and [[Alfred Leblanc]].  Leblanc was recovering from influenza and, probably made cautious by Hamel's crash, did not take the corners as sharply as Weymann, and Nieuport's aircraft, with a less powerful engine that Weyman's, was clearly not in serious competition.

===1912===
The 1912 race was held on 9 September in Clearing, Illinois.  The race was 30 laps around an elliptical {{convert|4.14|miles|km|abbr=on}} course, for a total distance of {{convert|124.8|miles|km|abbr=on}}. As none of the U.S. aircraft available to fly that day could exceed {{convert|78|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and with Védrines practice flights averaging far better, a French win was expected prior to the start of the race.&lt;ref name=Keokuk/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cairo/&gt;

'''Henry "Black-Horse Harry" Lee IV''' (28 May 1787 – 30 January 1837) was a [[biographer]] and [[historian]], born in [[Stratford, Virginia]], the son of Major-General [[Henry Lee III|Henry "Light-Horse Harry" Lee III]] and Matilda Lee. He was a half-brother of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General [[Robert E. Lee]].  In 1808 he graduated from the [[College of William &amp; Mary]].

==Politics==

Henry Lee IV served as a speech writer for the statesman [[John C. Calhoun]] as well as [[Andrew Jackson]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} After Jackson won election to the presidency in [[United States presidential election, 1828|1828]], Lee, along with Jackson and [[William Berkeley Lewis]], helped write the inaugural address.{{sfn|Parton|1860|p=164}} President Jackson rewarded him with a consular appointment to [[Algeria]]; the [[United States Senate|Senate]], however, refused the confirmation.

In his remaining seven years of his life, Henry Lee traveled abroad, dying in [[Paris, France]].

==Family==

On 29 March 1817 he married Anne Robinson McCarty, daughter of Daniel McCarty and Margaret Robinson. Anne and Henry had one child, Margaret.  Margaret was born in autumn of 1818, and died at the age of two in a tragic accident.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee′s nickname of "Black Horse" — a pun on the nickname of his famous father, "Light Horse" Harry Lee — originated in a scandal two years after his daughter′s death. Lee began an illicit affair with his wife′s young sister, Elizabeth, who was his ward at the time.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Louise Littleton |title=Frontier Tales of Tennessee |year=1989|publisher=Pelican Publishing Company|pages=73–75|chapter="Black Horse Harry" Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Storrow"&gt;{{cite web|last=Storrow|first=Samuel Appleton|title=Correspondence of Samuel Appleton Storrow|url=http://leeboyhoodhome.com/1821ltr.html#116|publisher=The Robert E. Lee Boyhood Home Virtual Museum|date=6 Sep 1821}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to at least one version of the story, Elizabeth became pregnant, although there′s no record of the child having survived.&lt;ref name=Davis /&gt; 
The McCarthy family brought suit to remove Lee as trustee of Elizabeth's inheritance and recovery of the money.  Unbeknownst to the McCarthys, Lee had misappropriated a portion of the trust for upkeep of [[Stratford Hall (plantation)|Stratford Hall Plantation]], the Lee family's ancestral home for six generations.  In order to conceal the misappropriation, Lee attempted unsuccessfully  to marry Elizabeth off to an unscrupulous suitor.&lt;ref name="nagel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nagel|first=Paul C.|title=The Lees of Virginia|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=206–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The legal fallout and resulting scandal forced Lee to sell Stratford out of the family.&lt;ref name=Davis /&gt;&lt;ref name=nagel/&gt; Elizabeth McCarty lived at Stratford for 50 years, from 1829 until her death in 1879.

Anne Lee, who had become addicted to morphine in an attempt to recover from grief at the death of her daughter, fled to Tennessee.  She was often a guest of future president Andrew Jackson and his wife. Henry Lee later followed, beseeching his wife for forgiveness.&lt;ref name=Davis /&gt; Andrew Jackson befriended Lee and began to assist in rehabilitating him in political and social life.

[[File:No Heels.jpg |thumb|right |High heels have been restricted by law and policy in various places such as schools, museums, and localities such as [[Mobile, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0LY7AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT338 |title=Fashion and Fetishism |first=David |last=Kunzle |publisher=The History Press |year=2013 |isbn=9780752495453}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case, the sign forbids them on [[Stearns Wharf]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]].]]
[[File:Stilettos-heels-b.JPG|thumb|A pair of [[court shoe|pumps/court shoes]] with {{convert|12|cm|frac=4|abbr=in}} stiletto heels]]
A '''high heel policy''' is a regulation or law about the wearing of [[high heels]], which may be required or forbidden in different places and circumstances.

Historically, high heels were used by aristocratic women for cosmetic reasons, to raise their height or to keep their feet and long dresses clean.  The style was then subject to [[sumptuary law|sumptuary]] laws.  In more modern times, [[stiletto heels]] have been restricted when they might damage the floor surface or cause accidents.

Some [[dress code]]s, however, require women to wear high heels so that they appear to be taller and more attractive.  Such footwear may be painful and damage the feet, and there have been repeated protests by women workers against such policies.  In 2016, a British receptionist was dismissed for not wearing high heels and she then started a petition which attracted sufficient support to be considered by the UK Parliament.

== Regulations preventing the wearing of high heels ==

===In history===
In 1430, ''[[chopine]]s'' were {{convert|30|in|cm|0}} high, at times. [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] law then limited the height to three inches—but this regulation was widely ignored.&lt;ref name="DeMello2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Margo DeMello|title=Feet and Footwear: A Cultural Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5QdKSxajwP0C&amp;pg=PA311|year=2009|publisher=Greenwood Press/ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35714-5|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 17th-century law in [[Massachusetts]] announced that women would be subjected to the same treatment as witches if they lured men into marriage via the use of high-heeled shoes.&lt;ref name=demello323&gt;{{cite book|author=Margo DeMello|title=Feet and Footwear: A Cultural Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LKTACQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA323|date=10 September 2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35715-2|page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1770, an act was introduced into the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British parliament]] which would have applied the same penalties as witchcraft to the use of high heels and other cosmetic devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Manners and Customs of the English Nation |author=John Brookes |pages=261–262 |publisher=James Blackwood |year=1859 |quote=In the year 1770 an act was introduced into Parliament against hoops, false hair, high heels...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floor surface concerns===
The pressure under a stiletto heel is greater (per unit of the very small area) than that under the feet of an elephant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/JackGreen.shtml|title=Pressure Under High Heels|last=Green|first=Jack|year=2003|accessdate= 20 December 2012|publisher= ''The Physics Factbook''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as  the very narrow [[stiletto heel]] became more widespread in the 1950s, the owners of many types of buildings became concerned about the effects of large numbers of such heels on their floors, especially in historic and high-traffic public buildings. Specifically, there was concern that the heels would either damage certain types of floor covering or cause minor accidents through heels getting jammed in floor-grills, the gaps in planking, or uneven surfaces. Soft outdoor ground also caused problems, affecting both the surface and the wearer.   Wood flooring was the most vulnerable, but carpets, [[linoleum]], and mosaic floors were also considered at risk of damage.  Signs were frequently posted attempting to ban stiletto heels, though they were generally ineffective.  A 1963 article in a US building maintenance magazine stated, "Replacement of floors is estimated to have cost at least half a billion dollars throughout the country since the advent of the stiletto heel fashion."&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Sanitation and Building Maintenance'', Volume 15, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

When stiletto heels were first sold in Africa, many of the wearers fell through the floors of their homes, not realizing that the floor timbers had been partly removed by [[termite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut van Emden, ''Handbook of Agricultural Entomology'', 2013, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|1118469593}}, 9781118469590, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=79ELgtB-yQQC&amp;pg=PT101 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  The  [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] claimed in 1963 that "with style changes the stiletto-heel problem has diminished".&lt;ref&gt;''United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service, research note, Forest Products Laboratory'', 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

High heels can represent [[contributory negligence]] by the [[plaintiff]] in American [[personal injury]] cases involving [[slip and fall]] accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Gary M. Bakken, H. Harvey Cohen, Jon R. Abele, ''Slips, Trips, Missteps, and Their Consequences'', p. 170, Lawyers &amp; Judges Publishing Company, 2007, {{ISBN|1933264012}}, 9781933264011, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aWatvfoR7vQC&amp;pg=PA170 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many high heel policies in the US are related to concerns over the potential for legal claims.{{Citation needed|date = June 2016}}

== Regulations requiring the wearing of high heels ==

=== In media and fashion ===
Some women have challenged the expectation that women should wear high heels in formal social situations. In 2015, a group of women were turned away from a film première at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in France for wearing flat shoes, including a woman physically unable to wear heels due to an operation on one of her feet.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/cannes-festival/emily-blunt-cannes-heel-row/|title=Emily Blunt on Cannes heels row: 'everybody should wear flats'|website=The Telegraph|language=en-GB|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women complained that this was a sexist policy which forced women into a stereotyped appearance; festival organisers later responded that there was no official policy on footwear and stated that they would remind red carpet officials of this.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/cannes-denies-high-heel-rule-women-red-carpet-173653799.html?ref=gs|title=Cannes denies high-heel rule for women on red carpet|website=www.yahoo.com|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In workplaces===
Guidelines on acceptable [[dress code]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in the workplace are permitted by Canadian law in order to ensure that employees are able to complete their work safely and effectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millerthomson.com/en/blog/canadian-labour-employment-law-blog/high-heels-in-the-workplace-could-be-high|title=Canadian Labour &amp; Employment Law Blog {{!}} High Heels in the Workplace could be High Risk for Employers {{!}} Miller Thomson|website=www.millerthomson.com|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the inclusion of the wearing of high heels in these guidelines has created controversy. Some workplace studies show that women in the hospitality industry who wear high heels have suffered injuries after tripping, falling or slipping.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, requirements for appearance which differ for male and female employees have the potential to be considered discriminatory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the mid-1990s, several US-based airlines required female [[flight attendants]] to wear shoes with heels. Minimum heel heights ranged from one-half inch to the two inches mandated by [[USAir]].&lt;ref name=marc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=law_pubs |author=Marc Linder |title=Smart Women, Stupid Shoes, and Cynical Employers |publisher=[[University of Iowa]] |date=1 January 1997 |accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flight attendants at times avoided censure by changing into more comfortable shoes during flights, since their supervisors were less likely to be present there.&lt;ref name="Banaszak-HollLevitsky2010"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jane C. Banaszak-Holl |author2=Sandra R. Levitsky |author3=Mayer N. Zald |title=Social Movements and the Transformation of American Health Care |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OePEMr_9l0wC&amp;pg=PA294 |date=24 June 2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-974214-1 |page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the UK [[Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists]] released a report outlining the dangers of wearing high heels for extended periods and approached unions and employers to collaborate on measures to ensure risk assessments would be completed on women's footwear, and to offer alternatives to high heels where these were deemed unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-shoes-heels-idUSTRE58F3WL20090916|title=UK unions spark debate over high heels at work|date=16 September 2009|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policies that force women to wear heels have been challenged in a number of locations. In 2001, [[cocktail waitress]]es in [[Las Vegas]] organised a "Kiss My Foot" campaign which was successful in getting casinos to relax their requirement to wear high heels.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=43 |title=Casino Women: Courage in Unexpected Places |first1=Susan |last1=Chandler |first2=Jill |last2=Jones |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2011 |isbn=9780801450143}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, waitresses at three restaurant chains in [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]], Canada, claimed that they were required to wear high heels at work despite complaining of pain and injury. Management responded that there was no written policy on wearing high heels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2052233/original-joes-boston-pizza-servers-claim-mandatory-high-heel-policies/ |title=Original Joe's, Boston Pizza servers claim mandatory high heel policies |last=Hart |first=Danielle |website=Global News |access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Israeli airline [[El Al]] introduced a requirement that female flight attendants wear high heels until passengers had been seated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2063591/i-dont-think-the-girls-thought-they-could-question-it-high-heels-policy-study-author/|title='I don't think the girls thought they could question it': high heels policy study author |last=Tucker |first=Erika |website=Global News |access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airline's workers' union stated that the requirement would endanger the health and safety of the flight attendants and instructed its members to ignore the rule.

Similar policies were tested again in the UK in 2016 when a [[temporary work|temporary receptionist]], [[Nicola Thorp]], was sent home unpaid after she refused to follow the dress code at the office of accountants [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]. Outsourcing firm Portico stated that Thorp "had signed the appearance guidelines" but after Thorp launched an online petition—"Make it illegal for a company to require women to wear high heels at work"—the firm changed their policy. The new guideline states that all female employees "can wear plain flat shoes or plain court shoes as they prefer."&lt;ref name="Guard-1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnston |first1=Chris |title=Woman's high-heel petition receives 100,000-plus signatures |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/12/nicola-thorp-high-heel-petition-receives-100000-plus-signatures|accessdate=13 May 2016|work=the Guardian|date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition gained widespread support from public figures such as Scotland's First Minister [[Nicola Sturgeon]] and [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] [[Caroline Dinenage]], [[Margot James]] and [[Tulip Siddiq]].&lt;ref name="McIntosh"&gt;{{cite news|last=McIntosh|first=Lindsay|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/heel-loving-sturgeon-steps-into-shoe-debate-vv2nlh825 |title=Heel-loving Sturgeon steps into shoe debate |work=The Times|location=London |date=16 May 2016|accessdate=7 March 2017}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tele-1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yorke|first1=Harry|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/12/firm-accused-of-sexism-in-high-heels-row-forced-to-change-its-dr/ |title=MPs back temp worker’s campaign to end 'sexist' high heel policy |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=12 May 2016 |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two parliamentary committees in January 2017 decided that Portico had broken the law; the company had already changed its terms of employment.&lt;ref name="McIntosh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bilefsky"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bilefsky|first=Dan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/world/europe/uk-parliament-nicola-thorp-heels.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0|title=British Woman’s Revolt Against High Heels Becomes a Cause in Parliament|work=The New York Times|date=6 March 2017|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The petition gained over 130,000 signatures, sufficient for a debate in the British parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Kaur Grewal|first=Herpreet |url=http://www.fm-world.co.uk/news/fm-industry-news/temps-high-heels-petition-heads-for-parliament/ |title=Temp's 'high heels' petition heads for Parliament |date=17 May 2016 |journal=FM World}}&lt;/ref&gt; This took place on 6 March 2017, when MPs decided the UK government should change the law to prevent the demand being made by employers.&lt;ref name="Hansard"&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |title=Workplace Dress Codes (High Heels) |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2017-03-06/debates/58CDA5AC-D655-43F4-BDD8-3D1370BCB076/WorkplaceDressCodes%28HighHeels%29 |house=[[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Westminster Hall]] |date= 6 March 2017 |column_start=198WH |column_end=216WH |speaker=[[Helen Jones]] |position=the [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] for [[Warrington North (UK Parliament constituency)|Warrington North]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bilefsky"/&gt; However, this was rejected by the government in April 2017 as they stated that existing legislation was "adequate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39667912|title=High heels row: Petition for work dress code law rejected|date=21 April 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=21 April 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]] amended workplace legislation to prevent employers from requiring women to wear high heels at work. British Columbia premier [[Christy Clark]] stated that the government was "changing this regulation to stop this unsafe and discriminatory practice."&lt;ref name="guardian-8apr2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Collig|first1=Pádraig|title=Canadian province makes it illegal to require women to wear high heels|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/apr/08/canadian-province-makes-it-illegal-to-require-women-to-wear-high-heels|accessdate=8 April 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2017, [[the Philippines]] forbid companies from mandating that female employees have to wear high heels at work.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/philippines-women/philippines-bans-mandatory-high-heels-at-work-idUSL8N1M637F&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov''' ({{lang-bg|Иван Колчев Калпазанов}}) is an industrialist, ancestor of the modern industry in Gabrovo and Kingdom of Bulgaria (1882).

== Biography ==
Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov was born in 1835 in the village Kalpazani near Gabrovo. His father Kolcho was a merchant who traveled in Bulgaria and Turkey to sell knives. His uncle Ivancho Penchov Kalpazanov was a famous Gabrovian public character.

== Working experience ==
Kolcho Kalpazanov died too young when his elder son Ivan was only 17-year-old. He had to take care for his mother, eight brothers and sisters. Both Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov and his cousin Petko Kalpazanov opened a small shop for different goods as sugar, rice, candles, coffee, textiles, etc. and made a small workshop for clothes there too.

Later Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov studied how to manufacture woollen cords. He became the most skillful manufacturer in Gabrovo.

In 1857 Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov visited the first modern factory in [[Sliven]] (established in 1834) and he decided to build his own textile factory. Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov made his own research for his future factory. On September 21, 1881 Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov met the young [[Vasil Nikolov Karagiosov]] and asked him to find a company for textile machines in [[Germany]], because he was informed that German machines ware of the best technical quality.

[[Vasil Nikolov Karagiosov]] sent a letter signed “To the most famous and celebrated textile company in [[Germany]]”. Accurate German post clerks sent the letter to the town of Chemniz, the factory of Richard Hartman.

Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov realized he could not build the factory all alone because that was an expensive investment. He took for a partner Petko Cokev – a Gabrovian craftsman.

In December 1881 Vasil Karagiosov and Ivan Kalpazanov visited the company of Richard Hartmann, chose suitable machines and signed contracts. Vassil Karagiosov and Ivan Kalpazanov were the men who delivered the first German machines in Gabrovo.

On November 13 and 14, 1882 the first textile factory in Gabrovo was inaugurated.

== Charity ==
Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov donated money for different charity organizations, churches and monasteries.

== Family ==
Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov and his wife Velika Stojanova had 7 children. The first daughter Deshka married [[Vasil Nikolov Karagiosov]]. The daughter Stojanka married the famous d-r [[Petar Conchev]]. Sons Nikola and Dobri developed active charity activities for the Red Cross in Gabrovo. Today their names are signed by the entrance of the building. The youngest son Dimitar was killed during the [[Balkan Wars]] in 1912.

'''Jack M. Greenberg''' (born September 28, 1942 in [[Chicago, Illinois]]) was Chairman and CEO of [[McDonald's]] Corporation from 1999 through 2002, when he was replaced by [[James Richard Cantalupo]].  He was promoted to CEO in 1998, succeeding [[Michael R. Quinlan]] in that role as Quinlan retained the title of Chairman.

A 21-year veteran of the company, Greenberg held the top spot during a tumultuous period, with the company suffering earnings declines in each of the last seven quarters of his tenure.  As Greenberg explained, "We were going through a transition from what I call a founder's company to a modern, global enterprise. There is a cultural shift from what we were to where we want to end up."{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

A graduate of the [[DePaul University]] College of Commerce (renamed the Driehaus College of Business in 2012), Greenberg also earned a juris doctor degree from the [[DePaul University College of Law]]. He is a certified public accountant and a member of the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]], the Illinois CPA Society and the [[Chicago Bar Association]], where he served as former chairman of the federal tax committee, and was president of the board of trustees of the Chicago Bar Foundation. Greenberg is a member of the [[DePaul University]] Board of Trustees. Greenberg is currently Non-Executive Chairman and Presiding Director of The Western Union Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.westernunion.com/Board_of_Directors.html "Our Board of Directors"]. Accessed 11 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

He originated the "Made for You" production system,&lt;ref&gt;Khwaja, Ameen. [https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/58082 "McDonald's CEO to Retire"], ''Entrepreneur'', 16 December 2002. Accessed 11 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; a cooking platform that facilitated a broader variety of menu offerings by allowing stores to precook meat patties and finish them to order.  Previously the McDonald's chain had used a "build to stock" manufacturing process, precooking, dressing and wrapping most food prior to receiving customer orders.  By postponing the finishing process (dressing and wrapping sandwiches), McDonald's could offer a wider variety of sandwich combinations without significantly increasing customer wait time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDC133BF935A35751C1A9649C8B63|title= Chief Executive Of McDonald's Plans to Retire|author=Sherri Day|date=2002-12-06|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cradles to Crayons is a national non-profit organization dedicated to serving children in need of basic necessities. In early 2016, the organization appointed Greenberg to be chairman of Cradles to Crayons Chicago, a location that he was very active in establishing. The organization also tapped Greenberg to be a member of the National Board of Directors.

== Awards ==
Jack M. Greenberg was inducted as a Laureate of [[The Lincoln Academy of Illinois]] and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State’s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 2003 in the area of Business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thelincolnacademyofillinois.org/4632-2/#toggle-id-14|title=Laureates by Year - The Lincoln Academy of Illinois|website=The Lincoln Academy of Illinois|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11359">'''Leaseback,''' short for '''"sale-and-leaseback,"''' is a [[financial transaction]] in which one sells an asset and [[leases]] it back for the long term; therefore, one continues to be able to use the asset but no longer owns it. The transaction is generally done for fixed assets, notably [[real estate]], as well as for durable and capital goods such as airplanes and trains. The concept can also be applied by national governments to territorial assets; prior to the [[Falklands War]], the government of the United Kingdom proposed a leaseback arrangement whereby the [[Falklands Islands]] would be transferred to [[Argentina]], with a 99-year leaseback period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3638438/Another-campaign-for-the-Falklands.html|title=Another campaign for the Falklands|first=By Sophie|last=Arie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar arrangement, also for 99 years, had been in place prior to the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|handover of Hong Kong]] to mainland China. Leaseback arrangements are usually employed because they confer financing, accounting or taxation benefits.

==Leaseback arrangements==
After purchasing an asset, the owner enters a long-term agreement by which the property is leased back to the seller at an agreed rate.  One reason for a leaseback is to transfer ownership to a [[holding company]] while keeping proper track of the ongoing worth and profitability of the asset.  Another reason is for the seller to raise money by offloading a valuable asset to a buyer who is presumably interested in making a long-term secured investment. Leaseback arrangements are common in the [[REIT]] industry.

===Possible solution to toxic banking assets===
According to Robert Peston, one-time Business Editor for the BBC, one option being considered for dealing with the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] is a sale-and-leaseback of [[toxic asset]]s.  Peston says "a sale-and-leaseback between the banks and the state has two supreme advantages: there's no need to value the poisonous assets; and losses on those stinky assets would be absorbed by the banks in manageable chunks over about 10 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/2009/01/first_septic_bank_revisited.html |title=Peston's Picks: First Septic Bank (revisited) |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real estate===
Leaseback arrangements are popular in France, the United States, United Kingdom, and throughout Australia and Asia, including, more recently, in India.

====France====
Leaseback of residential property has been popular in [[France]] for more than 30 years, and there are significant tax advantages. Under the scheme, the purchaser may use the property usually between 1 and 8 weeks per year (with a maximum of 6 months per year). The [[French government]] encourages the development of leaseback schemes in touristic areas to alleviate shortages in rental accommodation. The government rebates the local [[value-added tax|VAT]] (which is 19.6%), when the property is purchased off plan.

The scheme works by purchasing a freehold property. You become the legal owner. The property is then leased back to the developer or a management company. Under the leaseback scheme the government also refunds to you the VAT normally charged on a new build properties (currently 19.6%).

The owner is then guaranteed a rental income throughout the period of the lease. The net return to the owner varies between developments but is typically between 4% to 6%. This compares very favourably with a typical 20 year fixed rate mortgage of around 3.75%, and variable rate mortgages which are lower. It can be seen how the rental income can be used in respect of the mortgage payments. Loans of between 75% and 85% are available depending upon circumstances. The rental yield is also index linked annually to construction costs, which means the rental income currently increases by approximately 2.5%.

As in the UK there are tax allowances in respect of mortgage payments which can be offset against income. The lease typically lasts for between 9 and 11 years, after which the management company has the option to either renew, or the property can be sold, or rented out and held privately by the owner.

The purchaser/owner can also enjoy periods of usage free of charge through the year, depending upon the terms of the lease. These terms normally allows for between 4 and 6 weeks free usage each year. The management company is responsible for the maintenance of the property including the maintenance of furnishings which are often included in the purchase price. The developer is also responsible for insuring the building and its contents. It also pays for some of the property taxes and all the utility costs.

==== United Kingdom ====
In the United Kingdom, a form of leaseback known as [[sale and rent back]] was the subject of a 2014 [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] case that found many such arrangements had been perpetrated fraudulently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Jones |first= Rupert  |date= 7 November 2014 |title= Sick and elderly face pre-Christmas eviction as court backs lenders |url= https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/nov/07/sick-elderly-pre-christmas-eviction-court-backs-lenders |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate= 9 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
A "sale/leaseback" or "sale and leaseback" is a transaction in which the owner of a property sells an [[asset]], typically [[real estate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leaseback.asp |title=Leaseback |publisher=Investopedia.com |date=2013-06-28 |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then [[leases]] it back from the [[buyer]]. In this way the transaction functions as a [[loan]], with payments taking the form of [[renting|rent]]. Due to the lack of financing available in today’s market, many American businesses are increasingly turning to sale-and-leasebacks to provide quick [[capital (economics)|capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://netleaseinsider.blogspot.com/search?q=leaseback|title=Net Lease Insider: Search results for leaseback|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, developers of master-planned communities will often sell the [[model home]] to a buyer before the community is sold out, leasing it back from the buyer for a period of up to two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Lew | last=Sichelman | coauthors= | title=Sale-Leaseback | date=October 15, 2010 | publisher= | url =http://www.privatecommunities.com/second-home-buying/sale-leaseback.htm | pages = | accessdate = 2011-11-07 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some arrangements, the current [[lessee]] will give the option to buy the asset back at the end of the lease. Typically, if the original owner were to buy back the asset, it would take place at the end of the [[tax year]], in case any party were to be [[audited]] by the [[IRS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calkain.com/read-more-irs.php?id=44 |title=Hipp, Jonathan W. "Technical Advice Memorandum No. 2003-46007 - Calkain Companies, Inc." CALKAIN COMPANIES, INC. - Your Source for Investment Real Estate. Web. 20 July 2010 |publisher=Calkain.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other countries====
The leaseback concept has spread to other European countries, including [[Spain]] and [[Switzerland]].  Typical property available are studios, apartments, and villas. They are situated near [[ski]] areas, [[beach resort]]s, or [[golf course]]s.

==Commercial real estate==
A sale-and-leaseback is typically a commercial [[real estate]] transaction in which one party, often a corporation, sells its [[corporate real estate]] assets to another party, such as an [[institutional investor]], or a real estate investment trust ([[REIT]]), and then leases the property back at a [[rental]] rate and lease term that is acceptable to the new [[investor]]/[[landlord]]. The lease term and rental rate are based on the new investor/landlord's [[financing]] costs, the lessee's [[credit rating]], and a market [[rate of return]], based on the initial cash investment by the new investor/landlord. 

The reasons and advantages for a [[seller]]/[[lessee]] are varied, but the most common are:

* Help [[finance]] expansion of the existing business, purchase new plant equipment, or [[invest]] in new business opportunities. A sale leaseback enables a corporation to access more capital than traditional financing methods. When the real estate is sold to an outside investor, the corporation receives 100% of the value of the property. Traditional financing is limited to a loan-to-value ratio or debt-coverage-ratio.
* Help pay down [[debt]] and improve the company's [[balance sheet]].
* Help reduce the seller/lessee's business income tax [[legal liability|liability]] caused by the [[Capital appreciation|appreciation]] in value (land only) of its corporate real estate [[assets]]. In addition, the seller/lessee as a [[leasehold estate|tenant]] can deduct all [[renting|rent]] payments as a legitimate business [[expense]] on its annual tax returns.
* Helps limit risks associated with owning real estate such as cyclical market variations.&lt;ref name="Sale Leaseback"&gt;[http://www.cookcre.com/sale-leaseback-advisory Sale Leaseback], CookCRE | Sale Leaseback Advisory&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantages for an [[investor]]/[[landlord]] are:

* Fair return on the [[investment]] in the form of [[renting|rent]] during the [[lease]] term, and ownership of a depreciable [[asset]] already occupied by a reliable [[leasehold estate|tenant]].
* Long-term, fully leased [[asset]] with a guaranteed [[income]] stream.
* For [[income tax|income-tax]] purposes, the investor/landlord can take an expense deduction for an [[investment]] in a [[depreciation|depreciable]] property to allow for the recovery of the cost of the investment.
* Ability to invest in real estate with a tenant who is already familiar with the property.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

==Aviation==
Leaseback is also commonly used in [[general aviation]], with buyers using the scheme to let flight schools and other [[fixed base operator|FBO]]s use their aircraft.

Leaseback is very often used in commercial aviation to essentially take back the cash invested in assets. [[Airlines]], for example, sell [[aircraft]] and engines to lessors, banks or other financial institutions who, in turn, lease the assets back to them. Tax deductions can also be realized by the airline since the asset is no longer owned but leased. Due to the high price of aircraft and engines, especially new, the cash from such a leaseback is used by airlines to improve their financial performance.

==Industrial equipment==
The leaseback concept has also spread to [[industry]], mostly for industrial equipment. A company sells some of its equipment to a [[Lease|lessor]], such as a [[bank]] or another financial institution, which leases the equipment back to the company. Thus the company is no longer the owner of the equipment but keeps the use of it. This commercial transaction allows two companies to have at their immediate disposal the cash to make [[investments]] in new business opportunities.

==Plot==
An investment bank begins a mass layoff on the trading floor during a normal business day. Among those let go is Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci), head of risk management. Dale tries to speak about his current, unfinished project, first with human resources staff and then with desk head Will Emerson (Paul Bettany), but is told that this is no longer his concern. While being escorted out of the building he meets one of his risk analysts, Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), and gives him a USB stick to look at with a vague instruction to "be careful."

Sullivan works late that night to finish Dale's project, and discovers that current [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] in the firm's portfolio of [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] has exceeded the [[Value at risk|historical volatility levels]] of the positions. Because of excessive [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]], if the firm's assets decrease by 25%, the loss will be greater than the value of the firm itself and the firm will go bankrupt. Sullivan and his colleague, junior analyst Seth Bregman (Badgley), tell Emerson about the situation. Emerson alerts floor head Sam Rogers (Spacey), who also returns to the office. They attempt to contact Dale, but the company shut off his phone and he hadn't yet returned home.

They have emergency meetings in the middle of the night with division head Jared Cohen (Baker), chief risk management officer Sarah Robertson (Moore), and other senior executives to discuss their options.  Finally CEO John Tuld (Jeremy Irons) is called in. Cohen's plan is for the firm to quickly dump all of the [[toxic assets]] in a [[fire sale]] before the market learns of their worthlessness, thereby limiting the firm's exposure, a plan favored by Tuld. Rogers protests that dumping the firm's toxic assets will spread the risk throughout the financial sector and destroy the firm's relationships with its [[counterparties]], as well as cripple the market for the foreseeable future. He also warns Cohen that their customers will quickly learn of the firm's plans once they realize that the firm is only selling the toxic securities, but is not buying any new ones.

They finally locate Dale back at his home in Brooklyn, and Will is able to convince him to return to the office, informing him that the firm will not pay him his severance and other benefits unless he agrees to participate in their plan. Will also tells Seth he'll probably lose his job in the crisis, but will get a large severance, while explaining to him the amoral, cyclical nature of the markets. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Robertson, Cohen, and Tuld were aware of the risks in the weeks leading up to the crisis. Tuld offers Robertson up as the scapegoat, putting the blame of the crisis on her and forcing her resignation. Both Dale and Robertson are instructed to remain in the office all day and do nothing in return for an increase to their severance packages. Robertson expresses regret for not doing more to stop the crisis.

Before morning, Tuld is able to convince Rogers to go along with Cohen's plan. In a speech to his traders in preparation for the fire sale, Rogers warns them that, by participating, they are effectively ruining their reputations and ending their careers in the industry, but offers a $1.4 million dollar bonus to those able to sell 93% of their assigned securities, with further $1.3 million dollar bonuses if the entire sales floor can reach 93% as a whole. As the trading bell sounds and the markets open, Emerson and the traders immediately begin rapidly selling off their securities, and quickly arouse suspicion and anger from their buyers as the hours pass, and by closing bell the firm takes tremendous losses while dumping positions for cents on the dollar, but is able to successfully sell off all the toxic assets. After trading hours end, Cohen tells Rogers there will be another round of layoffs, but Rogers will keep his job. Angry that he was retained, Rogers confronts Tuld in the executive dining room, telling him that he wants to cash in on his options and severance pay and leave the company, but Tuld dismisses his protests, claiming that the current crisis is no different from various [[bear market]]s of the past, and that sharp gains and losses are simply part of the [[economic cycle]]. He persuades Rogers to stay at the firm for another two years, promising that there will be a lot of money to be made from the coming crisis. Cohen is seen bringing Sullivan into the dining room, and Tuld informs Rogers he is promoting Sullivan. Rogers reluctantly accepts Tuld's deal, but says it's only because he needs the money.

Rogers buries his dog in his ex-wife's front yard in the middle of the night, and learns from her that their son's financial firm took a big hit but survived the day's trading.
The screen cuts to black and the credits roll as the sound of Rogers shoveling dirt continues.

===Filming===
[[Principal photography]] began on June&amp;nbsp;21, 2010, in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="Dash"/&gt; More than 80% of the action was shot on the 42nd floor of [[One Penn Plaza]], which had recently been vacated by a trading firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wallace |first=Benjamin |url=http://nymag.com/movies/features/zachary-quinto-2011-10 |title=What’s Up, Spock?: He might be a famous Vulcan, but Zachary Quinto has no problem being fully human |work=New York Magazine |date=October 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jon |last=Chesto |url=http://blogs.wickedlocal.com/massmarkets/2011/10/22/director-of-margin-call-didnt-need-a-big-budget-to-concisely-depict-wall-streets-mortgage-meltdown/ |title=Director of "Margin Call" didn’t need a big budget to depict Wall Street's mortgage meltdown |work=WickedLocal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film received positive reviews from critics, garnering an 89% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 158 reviews with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads: "Smart, tightly wound, and solidly acted, ''Margin Call'' turns the convoluted financial meltdown of '08 into gripping, thought-provoking drama."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/margin_call/ |title=Margin Call (2011) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/margin-call |title=Margin Call Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New Yorker]]'' film critic [[David Denby]] said it was "easily the best Wall Street movie ever made".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2011/10/31/111031crci_cinema_denby?currentPage=1|title=All That Glitters|work=[[The New Yorker]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|last=Denby|first=David|accessdate=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three and half stars out of four, and said: "''Margin Call'' employs an excellent cast who can make financial talk into compelling dialogue."&lt;ref name="rogerebert"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/margin-call-2011 |title=Margin Call |first=Roger |last=Ebert |date=October 19, 2011 |work=RogerEbert.com |publisher=Ebert Digital LLC |accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: "It is hard to believe that ''Margin Call'' is Mr. Chandor’s first feature. His formal command — his ability to imply far more than he shows or says and to orchestrate a large, complex drama out of whispers, glances, and snippets of jargon — is downright awe inspiring."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/movies/margin-call-with-zachary-quinto-review.html?pagewanted=all |title=Margin Call with Zachary Quinto Review |first=A.

===Themes===
Roger Ebert wrote: "I think the movie is about how its characters are concerned only by the welfare of their corporations. There is no larger sense of the public good. Corporations are amoral, and exist to survive and succeed, at whatever human cost. This is what the [[Occupy Wall Street]] protesters are angry about: They are not against [[capitalism]], but about Wall Street dishonesty and greed. [...] [The cast] reflects the enormity of what is happening: Their company and their lives are being rendered meaningless."&lt;ref name="rogerebert"/&gt; A.O. Scott wrote: "''Margin Call'' is a thriller, moving through ambient shadows to the anxious tempo of Nathan Larson’s hushed, anxious score. It is also a [[horror movie]], with disaster lurking like an unseen demon outside the skyscraper windows and behind the computer screens. It is also a [[Sitcom|workplace comedy]] of sorts. The crackling, syncopated dialogue and the plot, full of reversals and double crosses, owe an obvious debt to [[David Mamet]]’s profane fables of deal-making [[machismo]]. Hovering over all of it is the dark romance of capital: the elegance of numbers; the kinkiness of [[money]]; the deep, rotten, erotic allure of power."&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

Although the film does not depict any real Wall Street firm, and the fictional firm is never named, the plot has similarities to some events during the 2008 financial crisis: [[Goldman Sachs]] similarly moved early to hedge and reduce its position in mortgage-backed securities, at the urging of two employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2010/12/10/433571/goldmans-uneasy-subprime-short/ |title=Goldman's uneasy subprime short |first=Tracey |last=Alloway |work=[[The Financial Times]] |date=December 10, 2010 |accessdate=May 24, 2015}} {{failed verification|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which essentially mirrors Tuld's comment about the advantage of moving first. Lehman Brothers moved second and went bankrupt. John Tuld's name is said to be a combination of Merrill Lynch’s ex-CEO John Thain and Lehman Brothers' ex-CEO [[Richard Fuld]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.businessinsider.com.au/margin-calls-director-j-c-chandor-2011-10?r=US&amp;IR=T |title=The Director Of 'Margin Call' Reveals The Event That Inspired The Film |first=Julia |last=La Roche |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=October 26, 2011 |accessdate=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Margin on services (MoS)''' is the financial reporting method developed by the [[Australian Accounting Standards Board]] that relates to [[life insurance]] companies in [[Australia]].

Under MoS, the value of future surpluses expected to emerge under the life contract is first determined, and then spread over the projected life of the policy. The spreading is normally done as a percent of projected claims in each future year, although other measures can be used, such as premium or expenses.

It is this approach to spreading which resulted in the approach being called "Margin on services".

Other characteristics of the MoS framework include:
* realistic projections
* policies can be assets
* a risk-free discount rate is used (unless there is market risk in the projections)
* future surpluses are recalculated at each reporting date, but are not capitalised to/from profit at that date, although loss-recognition events are possible

The method is specified in prudential standard LPS 340 issued by the [[Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority]].[http://www.apra.gov.au/lifs/PrudentialFramework/Documents/LPS-340-Valuation-of-Policy-Liabilities-January-2013.pdf]

'''Metro Center''' is the original colonial settlement of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], located beside a bend in the [[Connecticut River]]. As of 2011, Metro Center features a majority of [[Western Massachusetts]]' most important cultural, business, and civic venues.&lt;ref name=Zimmerman&gt;Zimmerman/Volk Associates, [http://www.mass.gov/Asfcb/docs/downtown_springfield_residential.pdf Residential Market Potential, Downtown Springfield], for City of Springfield, December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Metro Center includes Springfield's Central Business District, its [[Club Quarter]], its [[Springfield Municipal Group|government center]], its convention headquarters, and in recent years, it has become an increasingly popular residential district, especially among young professionals, empty-nesters, and creative types, with a population of approximately 7,000 (2010.)

As of 2011, Metro Center includes approximately 690 acres of land where the city was initially established, aligned north–south, following the Connecticut River, and is bounded by [[Route 291]] to the north, Union and Howard Streets to the south, Federal Street to the east and the Connecticut River to the west, although Metro Center is physically separated from the Connecticut River by [[Interstate 91]] – a 1958 urban renewal project that separated the city from its riverfront.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/I-91_MA/|title=Interstate 91-Massachusetts|website=www.bostonroads.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/neighborhood-metro.0.html City of Springfield, Mass.: Metro Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005014841/http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/neighborhood-metro.0.html |date=2011-10-05 }}. Springfieldcityhall.com (2010-06-02). Retrieved on 2013-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settlement and early history==
Metro Center, founded in 1636 by [[William Pynchon]] and a group of pioneers, was originally called ''Agawam Plantation''. At the time of its founding, Agawam Plantation was the northernmost settlement on the Connecticut River, and belonged to the [[Connecticut Colony]] as opposed to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], to which it would later belong. Within less than a decade after its founding in 1636, differences arose between the leaders of Agawam (Springfield) and Newtown (Hartford) over how to treat the region's Native population. Springfield hoped to pursue peaceful relations with the Natives so as to better facilitate trade and communal farming, whereas Hartford – and many of Connecticut's early settlers – had fought the bloody [[Pequot War]] to claim their territory, and thus took a more skeptical view of the Native population. This difference of opinion led to Agawam (Springfield) annexing itself to Massachusetts in 1640. At that time, William Pynchon was named magistrate of the settlement, and the town's name was changed to Springfield in Pynchon's honor. (Pynchon was from [[Springfield, Essex]].)&lt;ref name=Zimmerman/&gt;

Metro Center Springfield was founded on the Connecticut River, just north of the River's first falls unnavigable by seagoing vessels, (the [[Enfield Falls]].) Thus, in founding Springfield, the business-minded Pynchon assured that all northern river trade and travel ran through Springfield. In early colonial days, Springfield was the dominant trading post on the Connecticut River.

In 1675, during King Philip's War. the Metacomet-led [[Attack on Springfield]] burned over 75% of Springfield, which was only Metro Center, including the saw and grist mills. Following King Philip's War, thought was given to abandoning the settlement at Springfield; however, luckily, cooler heads prevailed and the settlement remained.

In 1777, noting Springfield's location on a major U.S. river, fertile farmland, and close proximity to Boston, Albany, New York City, and Montreal, [[George Washington]] and [[Henry Knox]] founded the U.S. National [[Arsenal at Springfield]] on a tall bluff overlooking Metro Center. Subsequently, Springfield developed neighborhoods other than Metro Center.

In 1813, the green in the middle of Metro Center was officially named [[Court Square]]. Court Square had been the center of public and social life since the times when Native Americans roamed freely through Springfield's streets (pre-King Philip's War,) and continued to be so until the building of Springfield's first train station in the 1830s.

The arrival of the railroad to Springfield in the 1830s brought great wealth to the city, again, due to its location. Goods from New York, Boston, Chicago, and even as far west as San Francisco travelled through Springfield on their ways to coastal distribution centers. Springfield, rather than Hartford, or Northampton, or Greenfield, became Western New England's railroad hub, perhaps due to the presence of the [[Springfield Armory]], but more likely due to the city's growing reputation for ingenuity, and that it served as a nearly equidistant point between Albany and Boston, Providence, and New York.

==Culture==
Metro Center features the majority of Western Massachusetts' most important cultural institutions. For example, it features the [[Springfield Armory]] [[National Park]], which includes a museum featuring the world's largest historic firearm collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/spar/index.htm Springfield Armory National Historic Site – Springfield Armory National Historic Site]. Nps.gov (2013-08-02). Retrieved on 2013-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt; A block west of the Armory is the [[Quadrangle (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Quadrangle]], which includes an extraordinary grouping of world-class and regional museums, each with a different focus. The Quadrangle features the George Walter Vincent Smith Museum, which is known worldwide for having the largest collection of Chinese cloisonné outside of China. It also features the Museum of Fine Arts, which features a particularly strong European [[Impressionist]] and [[Post-Impressionist]] collection, including paintings by Monet, Degas, and Gauguin, among others. The American Collection features works by Springfielder [[James McNeill Whistler]]. The Springfield Science Museum features the first-ever American [[planetarium]] (built 1937,) Dinosaur Hall, and a live animal center. The Quadrangle's two regional museums are the [[Connecticut River Valley]] History Museum, the most extensive compilation of information on the historic valley and its people; and the new Wood Museum of Springfield History, which showcases Springfield as ''The City of Firsts'' in the context of American History.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfieldmuseums.org/ Springfield Museums].

===Live entertainment near Court Square===
[[Symphony Hall, Springfield|Springfield Symphony Hall]] at Court Square features famously "perfect acoustics," and frequent performances by the innovative [[Springfield Symphony Orchestra]]. It also features traveling performances of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows. Also, close by, the Community Music School of Springfield, located at 127 State Street, features musical programs during the day and evenings. Across the street, the [[MassMutual Center]] features arena-scale rock concerts, conventions, and is home to Springfield's professional sports team, the [[American Hockey League]]'s [[Springfield Thunderbirds]].

Within close walking distance are Rascal's, a comedy club at 1 Monarch Place, and Springfield's famous City Stage playhouse – a tiny modern playhouse that produces a range of works from philosophical modern plays, to Shakespeare, to children's entertainment. If you plan an excursion to City Stage, it is best to check ahead to see if what's showing meets your tastes.

===The Club Quarter===
{{main|Club Quarter}}

The area surrounding [[Stearns Square]] has been Springfield' Club Quarter for over 120 years. As of 2011, Springfield's [[Club Quarter]] continues to expand, now featuring over 70 clubs, bars, restaurants, and even historic gathering places. For an example of the latter, the [[Duryea brothers]] built the first American gasoline-powered car at a still existent building on Taylor Street – one of the few buildings in the district at that time, which was not a bar or club. An 1893 model Duryea stands in a small park outside of what is today Alumni Club at 90 Worthington Street, mere feet from the historically important Duryea shop. Springfield's most popular bars and clubs are an eclectic mix, featuring Skyplex, a three-level bar and club directly on Stearns Square; Theodore's – voted America's best blues club; Oz, one of Springfield's five [[LGBT]] clubs and bars, (not counting the numerous clubs and bars that sponsor LGBT nights;) Shekago's, a martini bar featuring live jazz and piano-playing; and Fat Cat's Bar &amp; Grill, which features punk, industrial, and other live rock bands. In Springfield's Club Quarter, many different "scenes" co-mingle peaceably, including hip-hop, rock, LGBT, jazz, strip clubs for both men and women, and blues.

The restaurants and clubs by the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] also feature live music (Pizzeria Uno's, Mama Iguana's,) Las Vegas-style shows (Pazzo's,) and of course, several sports bars, such as Samuel's and Max's Tavern.

===Urban fabric===
Even by urban [[New England]] standards, where downtowns are frequently [[walkable]] like those in Europe, Springfield's is exceptionally so. {{citation needed|reason=No sources.|date=November 2015}}It is composed of mixed-use residential, commercial, and institutional organizations. A majority of its buildings were built in the late 1800s and early 1900s, giving it a Victorian look; however, there are numerous skyscrapers as well. Metro Center is cut off from the Connecticut Riverfront by Interstate 91, an 8-lane highway. Across Interstate 91 sits the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] complex, Springfield's largest tourist draw.

====Legislature skyline height limit====
From 1908 until 1971, Springfield was subject to a skyline height limit – imposed by the Massachusetts State Legislature – of 125 feet, and thus Springfield has a relatively lower skyline than comparable cities of its population and economic and cultural importance. This trait is now looked on as a positive by developers at the Urban Land Institute, who have written "Metro Center now stands out from its peers, most of which long ago demolished the human-scale architecture that made their downtowns livable."  During Springfield's resurgence in the new millennium, prominent architects – like [[Moshe Safdie]], who built the $57 million, 2008 U.S. Federal Court Building; [[Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates]], who built the $47 million, 2004 Basketball Hall of Fame; and [[TRO Jung Brannen]], who are building the $110 million, 2012 [[adaptive reuse]] of Springfield's original Technical High School – adapted to Springfield's human-scale to a create monumental buildings rather than attempting to "achieve monumentalism through over-scaling," as has happened in other cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=10708|title=WAN:: United States Federal Courthouse by Safdie Architects in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States|website=www.worldarchitecturenews.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transportation====
In 2012, Springfield's 1926 Union Station will receive a $75 million renovation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/fileadmin/Planning_files/rfqs/Union_Station_In_the_News/04-10-11-Project_Hops.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (including $4 million pledged by [[Connecticut]]) to become an intermodal transportation center, with [[Peter Pan Bus]]' headquarters, [[PVTA]]'s headquarters, and [[Greyhound]] all relocating to the new facility. This project will coincide with the start-up of Springfield's two new rail lines: the $1 billion, southbound [[Springfield Hartford New Haven rail line]], which will reportedly reach speeds up to 110&amp;nbsp;mph,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhregister.com/articles/2011/04/07/news/doc4d9cf8b24e8c3339028689.txt Conn. seeks funds for rail work on Hartford-to-Springfield line (document)- The New Haven Register – Serving New Haven, Connecticut] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419101014/http://www.nhregister.com/articles/2011/04/07/news/doc4d9cf8b24e8c3339028689.txt |date=2012-04-19 }}.

Ultimately, this renovation of the old Montrealer line will take passengers to [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhhsrail.com/ New Haven – Hartford – Springfield Rail Project].

Crcog.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

While billions of dollars are funding Springfield's north–south rail expansion, a more modest, combined $25 million recently improved Springfield's two main thoroughfares, Main Street and State Street. Both now feature artistic crosswalks and ornate streetlights, which add to the eclectic and increasingly whimsical atmosphere of Metro Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/247.0.html City of Springfield, Mass.: Transportation and Infrastructure Improvements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716062525/http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/247.0.html |date=2011-07-16 }}. Springfieldcityhall.com (2009-02-19). Retrieved on 2013-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the [[2011 New England tornado outbreak#The Greater Springfield tornado|2011 Greater Springfield tornado]] reversed much of Main Street's progress.

====Interstate 91's placement inhibiting economic growth====
Metro Center provides quick access to [[Interstate 91|I-91]] and [[Interstate 291 (Massachusetts)|I-291]], both of which connect to [[Interstate 90|I-90]] (the Massachusetts Turnpike), making trips to [[Boston]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[New York City]], [[Montreal]], [[Hartford]], [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] convenient by car. This convenience, however, came at a steep price to Springfielders: hasty, poor urban planning decisions during 1958 created the now elevated I-91 viaduct along the Connecticut River, which essentially cut off Springfield from the Connecticut, the parks surrounding it, and the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] complex, preventing foot traffic and resulting in untold losses of tourist dollars among other losses.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=larp_grad_research&amp;sei-redir=1#search="91+north+end+umass+cut+off"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/fileadmin/Planning_files/1200_Hall_of_Fame_Building_Plans/Springfield_TAP_Presentation_FINAL_diagrams.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, Boston's [[Urban Land Institute]] proposed a vision for Springfield's riverfront; however, as of 2011, Interstate 91 remains a physical barrier between Springfield, the Connecticut River, and the Basketball Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/riverfront.0.html City of Springfield, Mass.: Riverfront] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922000633/http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/riverfront.0.html |date=2011-09-22 }}. Springfieldcityhall.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of I-91 and its blockage of the Connecticut River – along with the cement covering of the Mill River – are challenges that Springfield officials say they plan on addressing in upcoming years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/10/big_dig-springfield_i-91_in_ci.html|title=Big Dig-Springfield? I-91 in city needs major rehab that could turn into a reimagining|publisher=|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent academic papers have documented negative economic and sociological effects of I-91's placement in Springfield – it has fragmented three neighborhoods, inhibited the economic growth of Springfield's most valuable land – on the Riverfront and around the Basketball Hall of Fame – and essentially made the river inaccessible to people as a place for recreation and tourism. Recent city planning polls rate Springfield's I-91 among the worst urban planning decisions made by an American city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbanplanet.org/forums/index.php/topic/24879-best-worst-use-of-waterfront/ Best / Worst use of waterfront – USA Northeast]. UrbanPlanet. Retrieved on 2013-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The highway's inhibiting effects on riverfront development were exacerbated during the 1980s and 1990s, when giant, above-grade highway parking lots were built underneath I-91, and later when earthen, grassy mounds and 20-foot limestone walls were constructed around large sections of it, blocking all but the tallest Metro Center buildings' views of the Connecticut River, and discouraging economic and social interaction between Metro Center and the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]].

==Buildings==

===Residential real estate===
Metro Center's housing stock was, for centuries, Springfield's most prized. As of 2011, it is fast regaining that status among people attracted to urban living without the expense – bohemians, artists, empty-nesters, and LGBT residents have constituted the first wave of Metro Center's recolonization, which began only during the new millennium. Housing stock consists of various architectural styles, from detached Victorian houses and attached red-brick row-houses in the [[Quadrangle-Mattoon Street Historic District]], to historic buildings adaptively re-used or renovated into condominiums, artists' lofts, and rental properties in the [[Apremont Triangle Historic District]]. Notable examples include a former 4-star [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] hotel, ([[The Kimball Towers]];) a famous, Victorian high school (Classical High School Condominiums;) an architecturally significant factory (The McIntosh;) and a renovated [[art deco]] apartment building, (Pearl Street Luxury Condos.) Rental properties include the adaptive re-use of the former [[Milton Bradley]] toy factory, now called Stockbridge Court, as well as the adaptive re-use of the former YMCA building, 122 Chestnut Street. Major construction projects like the $101 million adaptive re-use of Springfield's original Technical High School for Massachusetts' Data Center;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/02/demolition_of_springfield_tech_high_school.html Demolition of former Springfield Tech High School under way (photos and video)]. masslive.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt; the $57 million [[Moshe Safdie]]-designed, architecturally award-winning Federal Courthouse; and [[Baystate Health]]'s $300 million "Hospital of the Future," have all contributed to Metro Center's resurgence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs3springfield.com/news/local/Baystate-gets-the-OK-for-new-Emergency-Department----115747084.html  |accessdate=June 10, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Quadrangle-Mattoon Street Historic District]]''' is one of the few neighborhoods in the [[Knowledge Corridor]] that remains lined with historic, restored red-brick Victorian row houses on both sides, and shaded by tree canopies. The Mattoon Street neighborhood features some of Springfield's most prestigious residential addresses, on Mattoon Street, Salem Street, Elliot Street, and others. It also features one of renowned architect [[H.H. Richardson]]'s first works in the [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style, the current Hispanic Baptist Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mass.historicbuildingsct.com/?p=457 North Congregational Church, Springfield (1873) | Historic Buildings of Massachusetts]. Mass.historicbuildingsct.com (2009-07-27).

Mattoonfestival.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civic===
Metro Center features Springfield's and Western Massachusetts' most prominent civic institutions, including the [[Greek Revival]] Springfield City Hall, the Springfield School Board, the Hampden County Courthouse and [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] Juvenile Courthouse, designed by [[H.H. Richardson]] himself. Springfield's ornate, neo-classical [[Springfield Municipal Group]], dedicated by U.S. President [[William Howard Taft]], features a 300&amp;nbsp;ft. tall [[Italianate]] [[campanile]] that towers over Court Square. Other prominent civic buildings include "starchitect" [[Moshe Safdie]]'s new, $57 million, architecturally award-winning Federal Courthouse on State Street,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msafdie.com/#/projects/unitedstatesfederalcourthouse_springfield|title=Safdie Architects|website=www.msafdie.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Massachusetts' new $110 million Data Center, an adaptive re-use of Springfield's original Technical High School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/02/demolition_of_springfield_tech_high_school.html/ Springfield, Massachusetts].

===Libraries, colleges, and universities===
The City of Springfield's palatial Public Library is located in Metro Center. It features the second largest library circulation in [[New England]] (behind [[Boston]]'s.) Metro Center also features three higher learning institutions: [[Cambridge College]] at Tower Square, the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]'s Urban Design Center at Court Square, and [[Springfield Technical Community College]], which enrolls over 6500 students.

===Corporate and professional===
Metro Center is the central business district of [[Western Massachusetts]], featuring numerous international, national, regional, and local businesses and headquarters. 17,000 businesspeople work in Metro Center. Businesses include the [[Fortune 100]] [[MassMutual]] Financial, [[Peter Pan Bus]], [[Hampden Bank]], NuVo Bank, [[Merriam Webster]], [[Liberty Mutual]], [[Verizon]], the [[American Hockey League]], the Northeastern headquarters of [[TD Banknorth]], [[Health New England]], Peoples' United Bank, United Personnel staffing, numerous attorneys, architects, accountants, other professionals, and hundreds of businesses. As of May 2011, Metro Center also features the headquarters of Massachusetts' third largest company, [[Baystate Health]].

===Hotels===
Metro Center features several 3 star and 4 star hotels, including the Springfield Marriott Hotel; the Springfield Sheraton Monarch Place Hotel; the Hilton Garden Inn Springfield; and currently under construction (as of 2011) the former Epiphany Tower on State Street across from the [[MassMutual Center]] will become a 98-bed [[Holiday Inn Express]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2010/04/springfield_redevelopment_auth_1.html Springfield Redevelopment Authority OKs plans for Holiday Inn Express at former Epiphany Tower]. masslive.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parks===
Metro Center features seven prominent parks: [[Court Square]], the city's one constant topographical feature since its founding in 1636; [[Stearns Square]], designed by the creative "dream-team" of [[Stanford White]] and [[August St. Gaudens]], then as now in the heart of Springfield's [[Club Quarter]]; Tower Square Park, a green park atop a skyscraper in downtown Springfield; Center Square on Main Street, a well-landscaped park that borders the Club Quarter and Downtown Central Business District; Merrick Park, by the [[Quadrangle (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Quadrangle]], the sole function of which is to exhibit [[Augustus St. Gaudens]]' most famous outdoor bronze sculpture, ''[[The Puritan]]''; Pynchon Park, a [[modernist]] concrete park with trees and a distinctive elevator in the [[brutalist]] architectural style – one of the more original looking city parks in the United States, arguably; and [[Connecticut River Walk Park]], a walkway and bikeway that was devastated by the [[2011 New England tornado outbreak#The Greater Springfield tornado|2011 Greater Springfield tornado]], and which previous to it, was rarely used due to [[Interstate 91]] physically blocking Springfielders' access to it. Regardless, if one can make it there, it affords beautiful views of the river, valley, skyline, and mountains surrounding them all.

'''Offshore custom software development''', also known as '''offshore custom software engineering''', is the type of activity (profession), and the process aimed at the establishment and maintenance of the software, using technologies and practices of [[information technology]], [[project management]], [[mathematics]], [[engineering]] and other areas of expertise. Like other traditional engineering, software development deals with the problems of cost and reliability.
It is also a practice of hiring an external organization to perform some business functions in a country other than a customer’s country.

Offshore software development can include following services: product design and architecture, coding and testing; develops [[SaaS]], [[Internet]]/[[Intranet]] solutions, e-commerce, [[Customer relationship management|CRM]], project management and other special web-services (including Web 2.0 solutions).

The leaders in offshore custom software development are [[Russia]], [[India]], [[Ukraine]]&lt;ref&gt;http://itonews.eu/ukrainian-export-of-it-outsourcing-services-rises-by-40-percent-annually/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[China]]. Its business case should contain information covering five key aspects: strategic fit, options appraisal, commercial aspects, affordability and achievability.

== Recent trends in the sector ==

Given the rapid growth of this sector, several companies have started to use offshore development in China, India and other countries with a lower cost per developer model. Several new Web 2.0 platforms and sites are now developed offshore while the entrepreneurs and management is located in Western countries such as US, UK and EU. The advantages mostly revolve around better cost-control over the process, which means that there is lower cash-outflow (often the biggest struggle for startups). Furthermore, the time difference when working with India and China for the Western world allows work to be done round the clock adding a competitive advantage. Notable firms that are involved in development include [[Tata Consultancy Services]],  [[Infosys]],  [[Wipro]], and [[Mahindra Satyam|Satyam]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2503">'''Rockefeller, Andrews &amp; Flagler''' was a business concern formed in 1867 in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] which was a predecessor of the [[Standard Oil]] Company. The principals and namesakes were [[John D. Rockefeller]], [[William Rockefeller]], [[Samuel Andrews (chemist)|Samuel Andrews]], and [[Henry M. Flagler]]. Flagler’s step-brother [[Stephen V. Harkness]] made substantial investments, but was a silent partner and did not take an active role in running the business but he was actually the second largest stockholder next to JD Rockefeller.&lt;ref&gt;*Chernow, Ron. ''Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.'' Warner Books. (1998). {{ISBN|0-679-75703-1}} [http://www.h-net.msu.edu/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=25644997210593 Online review.]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1868, Rockefeller, Andrews &amp; Flagler was the largest [[petroleum]] refiner in the world. The partners are credited with recognizing the importance of utilizing and marketing all of the by-products of the refining process, and gaining market and pricing control through shipping rates. In a contract signed on June 4, 1868, Rockefeller, Andrews &amp; Flagler along with Cleveland's other two largest oil refiners - Clark, Payne &amp; Company; and Westlake, Hutchins &amp; Company - were given a 25% of the interest in the [[Allegheny Transportation Company]] in return for $1. The Allegheny Transportation Company at this time was controlled by [[Jay Gould]]. This stock was worth $62,222.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|last=Hawke|first=David Freeman|title=John D. The Founding Father of the Rockefellers|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|date=1980|pp=60-61|isbn=978-0060118136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their failed [[South Improvement Company]] scheme in 1871 in secret collusion with the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] led independent producers to revolt in western [[Pennsylvania]] in early 1872 and earned Rockefeller, the highest profile partner, much bad public opinion. 

However, the partners deployed other more successfully calculated and forceful approaches, which included buying out the competition and the formation of the various Standard Oil companies. By 1879, the Standard Oil Company did about 90 percent of the oil refining in the [[United States]].

The National Council of Small and Medium Sized Private Enterprises in [[Romania]] – CNIPMMR - is a [[Romania]]n employers’, [[non-profit]], non-governmental, non-political organization with legal personality, the only SMEs organization representative at a national level in [[Romania]]. CNIPMMR was established in 1992, presently having 68 branches, over 55,000 members and about 23 associated organizations. The network of branches provides a complete sectoral and regional coverage, all around [[Romania]].

On February 2, 2001, CNIMMPR was reorganized as the Local Council of Small and Medium Sized Private Enterprises (CLIMM). 

In 1996, in [[Craiova]], southeastern [[Romania]], a local office of CNIMMPR was created and today is known as CLIMM Craiova.

Craiova CLIMM's members are private companies, whose activities are focused on various fields such as industry, construction, manufacturing ([[wood]], [[milk]], [[food]], [[textile processing]], [[pharmaceuticals]]), trade and services ([[tourism]], [[health]], [[Consultant|consulting]], [[advertising]]). 

With more than 150 members, they have signed cooperation agreements with about 23 employer’s associations in different regions of the country which have consistent local activity, like the "Association of Businessmen in Hunedoara," the "Employers’ Association of Small and Medium Entrepreneurs in Vâlcea," the "Association of Small and Medium Enterprises Covasna," the "Employers’ Association of Small and Medium Entrepreneurs in Buzău," the "Women Managers Association in Romania," etc.

'''Sisyphism''' is a term used by French [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] theorist, [[political economy|political economist]], and member of the French assembly, [[Frédéric Bastiat]] to ridicule those that think that greater [[productivity]] causes [[poverty]] by increasing [[unemployment]].  The term derives form [[Sisyphus]], the [[Greek mythology|mythological]] king of [[Cichyrus|Ephyra]], punished for chronic deceitfulness by being compelled to roll an immense boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll back down, and to repeat this action forever.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frédéric Bastiat|Bastiat, Frédéric]]; Walter, Emile (transl.).

'''Skid Row''' is an area of [[Downtown Los Angeles]]. As of the 2000 census, the population of the district was 17,740.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Skid Row was defined in a decision in ''Jones v. City of Los Angeles'' as the area east of Main Street, south of Third Street, west of Alameda Street, and north of Seventh Street.&lt;ref&gt;[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1490887.html "Jones v. City of Los Angeles"] on [[Findlaw.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; Skid Row contains one of the largest stable populations (between 5,000 and 8,000) of [[homeless people in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;John Edwin Fuder, ''Training Students for Urban Ministry: An Experiential Approach.''  Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term "[[skid row]]" or "skid road", referring to an area of a city where people live who are "on the skids", derives from a logging term. Loggers would transport their logs to a nearby river by sliding them down roads made from greased skids. Loggers who had accompanied the load to the bottom of the road would wait there for transportation back up the hill to the logging camp. By extension, the term began to be used for places where people with no money and nothing to do gathered, becoming the generic term for a depressed street in a city.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Partridge|Partridge, Eric]]; Beale, Paul (ed.)

{{quote box|quote=The population is probably more motley than that in a similar district of any other American city.

===1880s through 1960s===
At the end of the 19th century, a number of residential hotels opened in the area as it became home to a transient population of seasonal laborers.&lt;ref name="resource1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/444/444.F3d.1118.04-55324.html |title=444 F.3d 1118 |publisher=Bulk.resource.org |accessdate=2013-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517210145/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/444/444.F3d.1118.04-55324.html |archivedate=2010-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, Skid Row was home to as many as 10,000 homeless people, alcoholics, and others on the margins of society.&lt;ref name=serenade&gt;{{cite news |last=Irvine |first=Huston |date=March 26, 1939 |title=Skid Row Serenade |work=Los Angeles Times |page=I6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It supported saloons, residential hotels, and social services, which drew people from the populations they served to congregate in the area.&lt;ref name="Wild2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wild |first=Mark |date=2 June 2008 |title=Street Meeting: Multiethnic Neighborhoods in Early Twentieth-century Los Angeles |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-94176-2 |page=152 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b_CekfFgglkC&amp;pg=PA152 |accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1947, LAPD chief [[Clemence B. Horrall]] ordered what he called a "blockade raid" of the whole Skid Row area. Over 350 people were arrested. Assistant Chief Joseph Reed, who claimed that "at least 50 percent of all the crime in Los Angeles originates in the Skid Row area," stated that there had been no "strong arm robberies" on Skid Row as late as one week after the raid. Long time residents, however, were skeptical that the changes would last.&lt;ref name=bowery&gt;{{cite news |last=Boyle |first=Hal |date=June 14, 1947 |title=Skid Row; The West's Bowery |publisher=Evening Independent |page=10 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UswLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GFUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=los-angeles%20skid-row&amp;pg=5989%2C1344783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, the city of Los Angeles was in the midst of a program to "rehabilitate" Skid Row&lt;ref name=fight/&gt; through the clearance of decaying buildings.&lt;ref name=landlords&gt;{{cite news |last=Sibley |first=John |date=July 3, 1960 |title=Slum Landlords Under Cities' Fire |work=The New York Times |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was presented to property owners in the area as an economy measure. Gilbert Morris, then superintendent of building, said that at that point the provision of free social services to the approximately one square mile of Skid Row cost the city over $5 million per year as opposed to the city average of $110,000 per square mile annually.&lt;ref name=fight&gt;{{cite news |last=Stern |first=Walter H. |date=June 28, 1956 |title=Wide Fight Urged on Decay in Cities |work=The New York Times |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city used administrative hearings to compel the destruction of nuisance properties at the expense of the owner. By July 1960, the clearance program was said to be 87% complete in the Skid Row area.&lt;ref name=landlords/&gt;

===1970s through present===
{{Update|section|reason=Only goes through 2006|date=June 2018}}
In the 1970s, two [[Catholic Worker Movement|Catholic Workers]] — Catherine Morris, a [[List of former Roman Catholic nuns|former nun]], and her husband, Jeff Dietrich — founded the "Hippie Kitchen" in the back of a van. Forty years later, in April 2014, aged 80 and 68, they remained active in their work feeding Skid Row residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

====1987 crackdowns====
In February 1987, LAPD chief [[Daryl Gates]], backed by then-Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], announced plans for another crackdown on the homeless on Skid Row.&lt;ref name=tangle&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boyarsky |first1=Bill |last2=McMillan |first2=Penelope |date=May 30, 1987 |title=L.A. City Attorney, Mayor Tangle Over Police Plan to Jail Homeless |work=Los Angeles Times |page=A13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police and firefighters conducted a number of sweeps through the area but the plan was abandoned due to opposition by advocates for the homeless.&lt;ref name=tangle/&gt;

When Gates announced in May that the crackdown would resume, Los Angeles City Attorney (and future mayor) [[James K. Hahn]] responded that he would not prosecute people arrested in the planned sweeps.&lt;ref name=wont&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boyarsky |first1=Bill |last2=McMillan |first2=Penelope |date=May 30, 1987 |title=Won't Prosecute Homeless Who Are Arrested—Hahn |work=Los Angeles Times |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hahn stated that he was "not going to prosecute individuals for not having a place to stay. I simply will not prosecute people for being poor, underprivileged and unable to find a place to sleep until I'm convinced that a viable alternative to sleeping on the streets exists."&lt;ref name=wont/&gt; Gates, still backed by Bradley, responded: "As the elected city attorney of Los Angeles, Mr. Hahn has a responsibility to file prosecutable cases which are presented to him by the Los Angeles Police Department."&lt;ref name=tangle/&gt;

A few days later, then-Councilman [[Zev Yaroslavsky]] introduced a proposal that the city stop enforcing its anti-camping laws on Skid Row until adequate housing could be found for all its residents.&lt;ref name=zev&gt;{{cite news |last=McMillan |first=Penelope |date=June 3, 1987 |title=L.A. Council Asks Police to Scrap Arrests of Homeless Unless Rooms Are Available |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |edition=Orange County |page=A11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council rejected Yaroslavsky's proposal, but after hearing testimony from Assistant Police Chief David Dotson describing the LAPD's intended crackdown methodology, the council passed a motion asking Gates not to enforce the anti-camping laws until adequate housing could be found for the area's residents.&lt;ref name=zev/&gt;

====Patient dumping====
In September 2005, hospitals and law enforcement agencies were discovered to be "dumping" homeless people on Skid Row. Then-Mayor [[Antonio Villaraigosa]] ordered an investigation and [[William Bratton]], LAPD chief at the time, claimed that the department was not targeting homeless people specifically, but only people who violate city ordinances.&lt;ref name="CookMalone2012"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cook |first1=Joseph G. |last2=Malone |first2=Linda A. |last3=Marcus |first3=Paul |last4=Moohr |first4=Geraldine Szott |date=17 July 2012 |title=Criminal Law |publisher=LexisNexis |isbn=978-1-57911-678-1 |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMuiJLbCW2UC&amp;pg=PT63 |accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Los Angeles City Attorney]] investigated more than 50 of about 150 reported cases of dumping.&lt;ref name="Jansson2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jansson |first=Bruce S. |date=2011 |title=Becoming an Effective Policy Advocate: From Policy Practice to Social Justice |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-495-81239-5 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OmkE7Zs91uMC&amp;pg=PA55 |accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By early 2007, the city attorney had filed charges against only one hospital, [[Kaiser Permanente]]. Because there were no laws specifically covering the hospital's actions, it was charged, in an untested strategy, with [[false imprisonment]]. In response to the lack of legal recourse available to fight patient dumping, [[California State Senate|California state senator]] [[Gil Cedillo]] sponsored legislation against it in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Winton |first1=Richard |last2=Blankenstein |first22=Andrew |date=February 22, 2007 |title=California bill would ban patient dumping |work=Herald-Journal |page=4 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SgsqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mNAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=los-angeles%20skid-row&amp;pg=6980%2C2769487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2006 lawsuit====
In 2002, newly appointed [[LAPD]] chief [[William Bratton]] announced a plan to clean up Skid Row by, among other things, aggressively enforcing an old anti-camping ordinance.&lt;ref name=victory/&gt; Robert Lee Purrie, for instance, was cited twice for violating the ordinance in December 2002 and January 2003 and his possessions: "blankets, clothes, cooking utensils, a hygiene kit," and so on, were confiscated by the police.&lt;ref name=victory/&gt;

[[File:MidnightMission.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Midnight Mission on Skid Row]]

In April 2006, [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] ruled in favor of the [[ACLU]] in its suit against the city of Los Angeles, filed on behalf of Purrie and five other homeless people, finding that the city was in violation of the 8th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and sections of the California Constitution guaranteeing [[due process]] and [[equal protection]] and prohibiting [[cruel and unusual punishment]].&lt;ref name=victory&gt;{{cite news |last1=Weinstein |first1=Henry |last2=DiMassa |first2=Cara Mia |date=April 15, 2006 |title=Justices Hand L.A.'s Homeless a Victory; In a case with national import, a federal appeals court rules the LAPD cannot arrest people for sitting, lying or sleeping on skid row sidewalks |work=Los Angeles Times |edition=Home |page=A1 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/422101669/9CC70A082C5A48C2PQ/12}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court stated that "the LAPD cannot arrest people for sitting, lying, or sleeping on public sidewalks in Skid Row." The court said that the anti-camping ordinance is "one of the most restrictive municipal laws regulating public spaces in the United States."&lt;ref name=victory/&gt;

The ACLU sought a compromise in which the LAPD would be barred from arresting homeless people or confiscating their possession on Skid Row between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. The compromise plan, which was accepted by the city of Los Angeles, permits sleeping on the sidewalk except "within 10 feet of any business or residential entrance" and only between these hours.&lt;ref name=respite&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Solomon |date=October 31, 2007 |title=Some Respite, if Little Cheer, for Skid Row Homeless |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/31/us/31skidrow.html |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downtown development business interests and the Central City East Association (CCEA) came out against the compromise. On September 20, 2006, Los Angeles City Council voted to reject the compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2006-09-20 |title=Handing Skid Row to the drug dealers |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/sep/20/opinion/oe-westwater20 |accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 3, 2006, police arrested Skid Row's transients for sleeping on the streets for the first time in months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2007-10-03 |title=LAPD Gentrifies Skid Row |publisher=Colorlines |url=http://colorlines.com/archives/2007/10/lapd_gentrifies_skid_row.html |accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 10, 2006, under pressure from the ACLU, the city tacitly agreed to the compromise by declining to appeal the court's decision.&lt;ref name=respite/&gt;

*The [[Skid Row City Limits Mural]] is an 18-by-50-foot mural displayed at San Julian Street, created in 2014. It features a map demarcating Skid Row's officially recognized boundaries alongside an official-looking sign, replete with city seal, reading "Skid Row City Limit, Population: Too Many." This is the initial installation of a mural project that is planned to eventually cover the whole wall on the San Julian block north of 6th Street. Installed in compliance with the city's mural ordinance, the project was organized by Skid Row activist General Jeff Page with local street art crew Winston Death Squad, and carried out with the labor of Skid Row citizens. Los Angeles City Councilman Jose Huizar's office has hailed the mural, saying, "It's community pride on the one hand, it's cleverly done and it creates conversation and debate, which often great public art does." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schaefer|first1=Samantha|title=For Skid Row Residents and Advocates, Mural is a Sign of Survival|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-skid-row-mural-20140824-story.html|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Romero|first1=Dennis|title=Skid Row Gets City Recognition Through Murals|url=http://www.laweekly.com/informer/2014/08/06/skid-row-gets-city-recognition-through-murals-photos|website=LA Weekly|publisher=LA Weekly|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solomon Andrews''' (5 April 1835 – 9 November 1908) was a British entrepreneur and head of the Solomon Andrews and Son bus and tram-operating company, based in [[Cardiff]].

==Family==
Andrews was born in [[Trowbridge]], Wiltshire, the son of John Andrews and Charlotte. The fourth of six children, he was baptised on 5 June 1835 in St James's Church, Trowbridge.&lt;ref&gt;Parish Registers of the church of St. James, Trowbridge&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 March 1855, Solomon married Mary Asher (20 August 1832 – 18 January 1870), daughter of John and Mary Asher, in Trinity Church, Trowbridge. There were five children from the marriage but only two survived infancy:
* Mary Lillah Asher Andrews (24 June 1857) married John McRae June 1880 in Cardiff and she died 13 Mar 1929
*Francis Emile Andrews (29 September 1858 – 30 November 1943)

His second wife, whom he married on 15 June 1870 in Knighton Parish Church, was Mary Jane Udell (born 2 March 1849) of Wrexham.&lt;ref&gt;Wiltshire Times, 14 November 1908&lt;/ref&gt; There were six children from this marriage:
*Beatrice Andrews (6 April 1871)
*Herbert Fletcher Andrews (16 April 1873 – 8 June 1874)
*Florence Andrews
*May Andrews, married William Edgar Clogg
*Daisy Andrews
*Sydney Solomon Andrews (26 February 1885)

==Career==
By 1851 Andrews was living in [[Cardiff]], at 17 Tredegar Street, and working as a baker and confectioner.&lt;ref&gt;The Wiltshire archaeological and natural history magazine: Volume 36, Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society – 1910&lt;/ref&gt;  The house was owned by George and Charlotte Asher, George being a baker and confectioner, so Solomon was presumably learning the trade.

On 24 November 1856 he leased a shop and house at 51 James Street. 

On 17 December 1863&lt;ref&gt;Keep Moving. The Story of Solomon Andrews and His Family, John F. Andrews, November 1976. {{ISBN|0 900807 23 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; he obtained a licence to operate a horse-drawn cab from the new residential districts of Canton and Roath to [[Cardiff Docks]]. By 1865, he had eight cabs and he is thought to have been an omnibus proprietor by December 1866.

His business interests grew rapidly to include tramways, buses, draperies and collieries.

His son Francis Emile (1858–1943) joined the company and eventually became a partner, the business becoming known as ''Solomon Andrews and Son'',

==Transport==
===Buses===
[[File:Star Omnibus Company horse bus, 2010 Cobham bus rally.jpg|thumb|Star Omnibus Company horse bus at the 2010 Cobham bus rally]]
He was best known for the Andrews Star Omnibus Company and the [[Star Omnibus Company]] (London) which provided horse-drawn bus services in London. His company also ran buses in:
*[[Belfast]]
*[[Leicester]]
*[[Manchester]]
*[[Nottingham]]

===Trams===
*Cardiff
*[[Plymouth]]
*[[Portsmouth]] – [[Portsmouth Street Tramways Company]]
*[[Pwllheli]] –  [[Pwllheli and Llanbedrog Tramway]]
*Barmouth Junction – [[Barmouth Junction and Arthog Tramway]]

==Property==
===Arthog===
[[File:Mawddach Crescent - geograph.org.uk - 985246.jpg|thumb|Mawddach Crescent]]
[[File:St Mary's Terrace Arthog - geograph.org.uk - 392611.jpg|thumb|St Mary's Terrace, Arthog]]
[[File:Arthog - geograph.org.uk - 245796.jpg|thumb|Arthog Terrace]]  
In 1894 he purchased an area near [[Arthog]] consisting of several farms. He developed three terraces of houses, including St Mary's Terrace, Arthog Terrace, and Mawddach Crescent. 

Mawddach Crescent was a row of properties overlooking the [[River Mawddach|Mawddach estuary]]. The Crescent was connected to [[Morfa Mawddach railway station|Barmouth Junction railway station]] by the short-lived [[Barmouth Junction and Arthog Tramway]] which he constructed. Andrews intended this to be the start of a purpose-built holiday resort but the surrounding land proved unsuitable for further construction. In 1941, during the [[Second World War]], the Crescent was commandeered by the [[Royal Marines]]. It was renamed Camp Iceland and used as a training facility.

St Mary's Terrace in Arthog was also served by the [[Barmouth Junction and Arthog Tramway]].

===Aberdovey===
Andrews purchased land here and started work by fencing off some of it. However, this provoked trouble locally as public rights of way were affected, so no development ever took place. The land was later sold to the local authority.

===Cardiff===
Andrews undertook the rebuilding of 10 Bute Street (now Hayes Bridge Road) in 1871. This building was intended to be a grocery and confectionery shop and the headquarters of the Solomon Andrews and Son firm.

In the 1870s the expansion of his omnibus business led to the acquisition of new sites for depots. A freehold site was purchased at Severn Road, Canton, in 1875, and a manager's house, bus shed, stables and workshops was constructed.

In 1875, he also undertook work on a leasehold site at Glebe Street, Penarth. In 1880 he built a tram car depot at the junction of Ferry Road and Clive Street, Grangetown. This was for the Cardiff District and Penarth Harbour Tramway Company which opened in 1881. 

Between 1881–83 Andrews built five houses and shops, five cottages and Windsor Hall in Holmesdale Street, and some houses in Earl Street. Andrews Terrace in Ferry Road, consisting of sixteen houses and a coffee tavern, was also constructed at around the same time.

In 1884 he constructed the Market Buildings in St Mary Street, Cardiff at a cost of some £12,000. Sadly this building was destroyed by fire in June 1885, and it had been replaced by September 1886,&lt;ref&gt;The Pictorial World, 9 December 1886&lt;/ref&gt; the new building being constructed with eight-inch-thick concrete flooring to prevent further fires.

In 1885 in James Street he began construction of Mercantile Buildings which survived until demolished in the 1970s during a road widening scheme.

In 1888 Andrews completed the Imperial Buildings on St Mary Street, Cardiff, which became known as Barry's Hotel. 

He also built two streets of housing which were named Mary Street and Solomon Street (later renamed Andrews Road), and was involved in the construction of warehouses on the southern side of Penarth Road, as well as between Crawshay Lane (now Curran Road) and Trade Street. Terraced houses were built from the corner of Blaenclydach Street south-westwards along Penart Road in 1891 to designs by the architect E.W.M. Corbett. 

The Atlas, or Hayes, Building was erected around 1893 and this survived until destroyed by fire in 1958. 

In 1894 Andrews constructed residential property from 75 to 113 Penarth Road, and the Andrews' Buildings on Queen Street to designs by the architect Edward Webb.

In 1895 the firm started building work in Penarth. Andrews' Buildings (Penarth), erected in 1896, consisted of five shops fronting Stanwell Road, a corner shop and two shops in Windsor Terrace. In 1897 the company built Lloyds Bank on the corner of Windsor Road and Albert Road to designs by the architect Edward Webb. This was followed by the Windsor Arcade, a row of shops on Windsor Road. 

Around 1900 Metropole Buildings, 3–7 The Hayes, Cardiff was erected. This building was badly damaged by an air raid in the Second World War, but was reconstructed in 1959. 

Numbers,11, 12, and 13 Bute Street (now Hayes Bridge Road) were rebuilt in 1902 to designs by the architect Lennox Robertson. Andrews also constructed Pembroke Buildings on Pembroke Terrace in the same year, using the architect E.W.M. Corbett.

===Pwllheli===
[[File:Promenâd Pwllheli Promenade - geograph.org.uk - 346014.jpg|thumb|Pwllheli Promenade]]
In [[Pwllheli]], Andrews was responsible for the development of the West End holiday resort, which included a promenade, housing, roads, a recreation ground, golf course, and the West End Hotel.  The stone required to build the West End was provided by a local quarry that he leased at Carreg-y-defaid. The company constructed the [[Pwllheli and Llanbedrog Tramway]], which carried the stone and passengers.

The West End Hotel was constructed first, along with large houses numbered 1–4 The Parade. The hotel was probably completed by 1895 and the houses in 1896. The construction was mostly in concrete, with the joinery being provided by his workshops in Cardiff and delivered to Pwllheli by rail. 

Further building work was undertaken in 1897 when plans for nos 5–10 The Parade were approved by the council. Nos 11–16 followed quickly afterwards and all were completed by 1899.

Construction of housing and shops in Cardiff Road was undertaken between 1897 and 1901. A power station was erected next to the Assembly Rooms behind the West End Hotel, to provide electrical power for the West End Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;History of the Gas Industry in Pwllheli, W. N. Thomas.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stakeholder management''' is a critical component to the successful delivery of any project, programme or activity. A [[Project stakeholders|stakeholder]] is any individual, group or organization that can affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a programme.&lt;ref name="Stakeholder Identification"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sowden |first1=Rod |last2=Office |first2=Cabinet |date=August 30, 2011 |title=Managing successful programmes |publisher=Stationery Office |page=59| isbn=9780113313273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stakeholder management creates positive relationships with stakeholders through the appropriate management of their expectations and agreed objectives. Stakeholder management is a process and control that must be planned and guided by underlying principles. Stakeholder management within businesses, organizations, or projects prepares a [[strategy]] using information (or intelligence) gathered during the following common processes.

==Stakeholder identification==
{{main|Stakeholder analysis}}
The first step in your stakeholder analysis is to brainstorm who your stakeholders are. As part of this, think of all the people who are affected by your work, who have influence or power over it, or have an interest in its successful or unsuccessful conclusion. Remember that although stakeholders may be both [[organization]]s and [[people]], ultimately you must communicate with people. Make sure that you identify the correct individual stakeholders within a stakeholder organization.&lt;ref name="Prioritize Your Stakeholders"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sowden |first1=Rod |last2=Office |first2=Cabinet |date=August 30, 2011 |title=Managing successful programmes |publisher=Stationery Office |page=64| isbn=9780113313273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

So in a nutshell, the stakeholder management comprises four steps:&lt;ref name="Stakeholder management"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.apm.org.uk/bok/stakeholder-management |title=APM Knowledge Stakeholder management |author=Association for Project Management (APM)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Identify, recognize and acknowledge stakeholder;
* Determine their influence and interest;
* Establish [[communication management]] plan
* Influencing and engaging stakeholder

==Stakeholder prioritization ==
You may now have a long list of people and organizations that are affected by your work. Some of these may have the power either to block or advance. Some may be interested in what you are doing, others may not care. Map out your stakeholders on a Power/Interest Grid, and classify them by their power over your work and by their interest in your work. There are other tools available to map out your stakeholders and how best to influence them.

For example, your boss is likely to have high power and influence over your projects and high interest. Your family may have high interest, but are unlikely to have power over it. Someone's position on the grid shows you the actions you have to take with them:
*'''High power, interested people:''' these are the people you must fully engage and make the greatest efforts to satisfy.
*'''High power, less interested people:''' put enough work in with these people to keep them satisfied, but not so much that they become bored with your message.
*'''Low power, interested people:''' keep these people adequately informed, and talk to them to ensure that no major issues are arising. These people can often be very helpful with the detail of your project.
*'''Low power, less interested people:''' again, monitor these people, but do not bore them with excessive communication.

==Understanding your key stakeholders==
You now need to know more about your key stakeholders. You need to know how they are likely to feel about and react to your project. You also need to know how best to engage them in your project and how best to communicate with them.  Key questions that can help you understand your stakeholders are:
*What financial or emotional interest do they have in the outcome of your work? Is it positive or negative?
*What motivates them most of all?
*What information do they want from you?
*How do they want to receive information from you? What is the best way of communicating your message to them?
*What is their current opinion of your work? Is it based on good information?
*Who influences their opinions generally, and who influences their opinion of you? Do some of these influencers therefore become important stakeholders in their own right?
*If they are not likely to be positive, what will win them around to support your project?
*If you don't think you will be able to win them around, how will you manage their opposition?
*Who else might be influenced by their opinions? Do these people become stakeholders in their own right?

==Key principles of stakeholder engagement==
* Communicate: To ensure intended message is understood and the desired response achieved.
* Consult, early and often: To get the useful information and ideas, ask questions.
* Remember, they are human: Operate with an awareness of human feelings.
* Plan it: Time investment and careful planning against it, has a significant payoff.
* Relationship: Try to engender trust with the stakeholders. 
* Simple but not easy: Show your care. Be empathetic.Listen to the stakeholders.
* [[Risk management|Managing risk]]: Stakeholders can be treated as risk and opportunities that have probabilities and impact.
* Compromise: Compromise across a set of stakeholders' diverging priorities.
* Understand what is success: Explore the value of the project to the stakeholder.
* Take responsibility: Project governance is the key of project success

==Organizational stakeholders==
It is well acknowledged that any given organization will have multiple stakeholders including, but not limited to, customers, shareholders, employees, suppliers, and so forth. Within the field of marketing, it is believed that customers are one of the most important stakeholders for managing its long-term value, with a firm's major objective being the management of customer satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon E. Greenley and Gordon R. Foxall. (2003). Multiple Stakeholder Orientation in UK Companies and the Implications for Company Performance. ''Journal of Management Studies, 34'', 259–284.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engaging and communicating with stakeholders==

With a clear understanding of your Stakeholders, engaging and communicating can be achieved through a variety of channels based upon who the stakeholder is.&lt;ref name="Managing Stakeholder Expectations"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pmiglc.org/PD/Uploads/PMIGreatLakesChapter_Dec2011Forum_GMoore.pdf |last=Moore |first=Gwendolyn |date=December 12, 2011 |title=PMI Great Lakes Chapter Forum, Tools and Techniques for Managing Stakeholder Expectations |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''High power, interested people:''' Manage closely. Best channels: [[Issue Log|Issue]], Change Logs, Status Meetings
*'''High power, less interested people:''' Keep satisfied. Best channels: Steering Committee, Board Meeting Updates
*'''Low power, interested people:''' Keep informed. Best channels: In-Person, Video, Email Updates
*'''Low power, less interested people:''' Monitor. Best channels: Send Email, Status Reports

==Background==

Gary Keller is the co-founder and Chairman of the Board at [[Keller Williams Realty]], which is one of the world's largest [[real estate]] companies.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burg"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Keller |first=Gary |subject-link= |interviewer=Bob Burg|title=The ONE Thing – An Interview with Gary Keller |url=http://www.burg.com/2013/04/the-one-thing-an-interview-with-gary-keller/ |date=15 April 2013 |access-date=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jay Papasan is the Vice President of publishing at Keller Williams. Prior to the publication of ''The ONE Thing'' in 2013, the two collaborated on ''The Millionaire Real Estate'' series of books which discussed how to invest in and earn money from real estate properties.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Howes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Indie"&gt;{{cite news | last=Coles Johnson| first=Donna Maria| title =November 2013 Indie Business Book Club: The ONE Thing by Gary Keller and Jay Papasan | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =Indie Business Network | date =1 November 2013 | url =http://www.indiebusinessnetwork.com/book-club-the-one-thing-by-indie-business-network-founder-and-ceo-donna-maria/| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The ONE Thing'' is the duo's first book that is not specifically focused on real estate. Instead, it discusses the general business principle of choosing a single task to work on to theoretically maximize the efficiency of that task and the overall project.&lt;ref name="Kirkus"&gt;{{cite news | last=| first=| title =The One Thing| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''| date =15 March 2013 | url =https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/gary-keller/the-one-thing/| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quartz"&gt;{{cite news | last=Elmer| first=Vickie| title =Forget the long to-do lists and choose one thing to be good at| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]| date =19 April 2013 | url =http://qz.com/75571/the-path-to-success-choose-one-thing-to-be-good-at/| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zoia"&gt;{{cite news | last=Zoia| first=Robert| title =The One Thing: The surprisingly simple truth behind extraordinary results, by Gary Keller (Book Review)| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =Zoia.org| date =15 January 2015 | url =http://zoia.org/2015/01/15/the-one-thing-the-surprisingly-simple-truth-behind-extraordinary-results-by-gary-keller-book-review/| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

The book discusses the benefits of prioritizing a single task, and it also provides examples of how to engage in those tasks with a singular focus.&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt; The book begins with a section entitled, "The Lies: They Mislead and Derail Us," which analyzes the ways in which multitasking has erroneously been praised as a desirable trait.&lt;ref name="Blu"&gt;{{cite news | last=| first=| title =The Business Book Review: The ONE Thing, Gary Keller| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =Blu Pagoda| date =5 May 2015 | url =http://www.blupagoda.com/blog/2015/5/5/the-business-book-review-the-one-thing-gary-keller| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors also challenge the concept of "work-life balance", calling it "[i]dealistic, but not realistic."&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt;

This then leads to the "Focusing Question" which asks "What’s the ONE Thing I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?" This second section of the book deals with productivity principles like habit-building and benchmarking.&lt;ref name="Blu"/&gt; For instance, the book suggests that readers should engage in four hours of work on their "ONE thing" each day.&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Huff"&gt;{{cite news | last=Brady| first=Arlo| title =The ONE Thing | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =[[The Huffington Post]] | date =13 October 2013 | url =http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-arlo-brady/the-one-thing_1_b_3732007.html| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors cite [[economist]] [[Vilfredo Pareto]] as one of the inspirations behind this philosophy. Pareto's principle suggested that 20% of the effort produces 80% of the results. According to the book, this means that engaging in the one most important task will be more likely to produce the desired results without any extraneous effort.&lt;ref name="PStar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quartz"/&gt; The book also differentiates between the Big-Picture Question ("What’s my ONE Thing?") and the Small-Focus Question ("What’s my ONE Thing right now?").&lt;ref name="Blu"/&gt; The core idea is that focusing on an excessive amount of tasks will more likely lead to discord and under-performance.&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;{{cite news | last=Maresca| first=Joseph S.| title =Book Review: The One Thing by Gary Keller, Jay Papasan | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =[[Blogcritics]] | date =18 May 2013 | url =http://blogcritics.org/book-review-the-one-thing-by/| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atiim"&gt;{{cite news | last=Rotenberg| first=Zorian| title =Book Insights from The ONE Thing by Gary Keller and Jay Papasan | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =Atiim| date =14 January 2016 | url =https://www.atiim.com/blog/the-one-thing-by-gary-keller-and-jay-papasan/| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third section of the book discusses "Extraordinary Results," which details how to make the above principles actionable. One of the concepts it illustrates is "time blocking," which means that one should focus on only their ONE thing during a given amount of time. It also suggests that readers should schedule time to reflect, plan, and even relax. Everything else during scheduled time blocks is characterized as a distraction. Each section of the book is followed up by a "Big Ideas" review that gives a summary of the sections' concepts and principles.&lt;ref name="Blu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EntreTime"&gt;{{cite news | last=Vozza| first=Stephanie| title =Time Blocking: a Productivity Power Tool | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = ''[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]''| date =8 April 2013 | url =https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/226231| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

''The ONE Thing'' garnered success both critically and commercially. It was listed as a best seller by ''The New York Times'',&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; ''The Wall Street Journal'',&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; ''USA Today'', and Amazon.com.&lt;ref name="Howes"/&gt; [[Hudson Booksellers]] listed it among their best "Business Interest" books of 2013.&lt;ref name="Hudson"&gt;{{cite news | last=| first=| title =Hudson Booksellers Announces the Best Books of 2013 | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = Digital Journal| date =12 November 2013 | url =http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/1582146| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for ''[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]'', Brandon Turner named ''The ONE Thing'' one of the "5 Powerful Books That Changed the Direction of My Life."&lt;ref name="Entre5"&gt;{{cite news | last=Turner| first=Brandon| title =5 Powerful Books That Changed the Direction of My Life  | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = ''[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]''| date =25 March 2015 | url =https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/244123| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review for ''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]'', Alice Haine notes that the book "has the necessary ingredients to boost those feeling a little overwhelmed by the pressures of work and home life."&lt;ref name="National"&gt;{{cite news | last=Haine| first=Alice| title =Actions speak louder than to-do lists | newspaper =''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]''| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =24 July 2013 | url =http://www.thenational.ae/business/industry-insights/the-life/actions-speak-louder-than-to-do-lists| accessdate =24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review on [[Blogcritics]] states "[t]his book will benefit management at virtually every level in an organization."&lt;ref name="BC"/&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' noted that book had "an appealing style and energy."&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt; It has won a total of 12 book awards and been translated into 26 languages. It was also voted one of the Top 100 Business Books of All Time on [[Goodreads]].

[[Image:TABBourkeSt.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A TAB in [[Melbourne]]]]
The '''Totalisator Agency Board''' in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], universally shortened to '''TAB''' or  '''T.A.B''', is the name given to monopoly [[totalisator]] organisations. All were originally government owned. In Victoria for instance, the State government owned Victorian Totalisator Agency Board began operating in March 1961.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/content.php?pid=128214&amp;sid=1100338#3567577 The Melbourne Cup Research Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Australian TABs have been progressively privatised, beginning with Victoria in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabcorp.com.au/about_history.aspx TABCorp history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224225407/http://www.tabcorp.com.au/about_history.aspx |date=24 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TABs in Queensland, South Australia, Northern Territory and Tasmania were re-branded as [[Ubet, Wagering Company|UBET]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.couriermail.com.au/business/tab-gets-makeover-with-hitech-ubet-store-to-open/news-story/59245464b438a92000bfa0c9886b7bf1 TAB gets a makeover to UBET]&lt;/ref&gt;

The TABs have extensive radio networks in Australia, except in Victoria and Tasmania where other parties own equivalent networks. All these networks share the [[National Racing Service]], a continuous broadcast of [[horse racing|thoroughbred]], [[harness racing|harness]] and [[greyhound racing]]. This makes up the bulk of these networks' content. Collectively, these networks own more radio licences than any other group in Australia – however, their terrestrial coverage is less than the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] as they generally have tiny wattages.

The heir of the NSW TAB also owns a national racing subscription TV service. In New Zealand, the TAB owns a near-national free-to-air and national subscription TV service. Most New Zealanders can sit at their analogue TV with a standard aerial and watch racing.

The New Zealand TAB was replaced by the [[New Zealand Racing Board]] in 2003.

[[Radio TAB]] is also used to live sports coverage (including horse racing) in parts of Australia.

'''Variable costs''' are costs that change in proportion to the good or service that a business produces.&lt;ref name="GNB pp 48"&gt;Garrison, Noreen, Brewer. Ch 2 - Managerial Accounting and Costs Concepts, pp 48&lt;/ref&gt; Variable costs are also the sum of [[marginal cost]]s over all units produced. They can also be considered normal costs. [[Fixed cost]]s and variable costs make up the two components of [[total cost]]. '''Direct costs''', however, are costs that can easily be associated with a particular [[cost object]].&lt;ref name="GNB pp 51"&gt;Garrison, Noreen, Brewer. Ch 2 - Managerial Accounting and Costs Concepts, pp 51&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all variable costs are direct costs. For example, variable manufacturing [[Overhead (business)|overhead]] costs are variable costs that are [[indirect costs]], not direct costs.  Variable costs are sometimes called unit-level costs as they vary with the number of units produced.

Direct labor and overhead are often called '''conversion cost''',&lt;ref name="GNB pp 39"&gt;Garrison, Noreen, Brewer. Ch 2 - Managerial Accounting and Costs Concepts, pp 39&lt;/ref&gt; while direct material and direct labor are often referred to as '''prime cost'''.&lt;ref name="GNB pp 39" /&gt;

In [[marketing]], it is necessary to know how costs divide between variable and fixed. This distinction is crucial in forecasting the earnings generated by various changes in unit sales and thus the financial impact of proposed marketing campaigns. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 60 percent responded that they found the "variable and fixed costs" metric very useful.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics&gt;Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). ''Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance.''

The level of variable cost is influenced by many factors, such as [[fixed cost]], [[Duration (project management)|duration of project]], [[uncertainty]] and [[Interest rate|discount rate]]. An analytical formula of variable cost as a function of these factors has been derived. It can be used to assess how different factors impact variable cost and total return in an investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Unity of Science and Economics: A New Foundation of Economic Theory|last=Chen|first=Jing|publisher=Springer|year=2016|isbn=|location=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493934645|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanation ==
===Example 1===

Assume a business produces clothing. A variable cost of this product would be the direct material, i.e., cloth, and the direct labor. If it takes one laborer 6 yards of cloth and 8 hours to make a shirt, then the cost of labor and cloth increases if two shirts are produced.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! 1 shirt  !! 2 shirts !! 3 shirts
|-
| Cloth (Direct Materials) || 6yds || 12yds || 18yds
|-
| Labor (Direct Labor) || 8hrs || 16hrs || 24hrs
|}


The amount of materials and labor that goes into each shirt increases in direct proportion to the number of shirts produced. In this sense, the cost "varies" as production varies.

===Example 2===
For example, a firm pays for [[raw materials]]. When activity is decreased, less raw material is used, and so the spending for raw materials falls. When activity is increased, more raw material is used, and spending therefore rises. Note that the changes in expenses happen with little or no need for managerial intervention. These costs are variable costs.

A company will pay for line rental and maintenance fees each period regardless of how much power gets used. And some electrical equipment (air conditioning or lighting) may be kept running even in periods of low activity. These expenses can be regarded as fixed. But beyond this, the company will use electricity to run plant and machinery as required. The busier the company, the more the plant will be run, and so the more electricity gets used. This extra spending can therefore be regarded as variable.

In retail the cost of goods is almost entirely a variable cost; this is not true of manufacturing where many fixed costs, such as depreciation, are included in the cost of goods.

Although taxation usually varies with profit, which in turn varies with sales volume, it is not normally considered a variable cost.

For some employees, salary is paid on monthly rates, independent of how many hours the employees work. This is a fixed cost. On the other hand, the hours of hourly employees can often be varied, so this type of labour cost is a variable cost.  The cost of material is a variable cost.

'''Yves Bouvier''' (born 8 September 1963) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[businessman]] and [[art dealer]] best known for his role in [[the Bouvier Affair]]. He was the president of Natural Le Coultre, an international company specialized in the transportation, storage, scientific analysis, and conservation of works of art, luxurious goods and other collectibles. In September 2017, it emerged that Bouvier is under criminal investigation by Swiss authorities amid allegations that he may have evaded more than 100 million euros in taxes related to his cross-border art dealings.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.artnet.com/art-world/yves-bouvier-swiss-tax-charges-1072205&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, meanwhile, the Geneva Prosecutor reportedly opened a new criminal investigation into Bouvier relating to an indictment on charges of fraud.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-08/bouvier-questioned-by-geneva-prosecutor-over-russian-art-deals&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Yves Bouvier is the son of Jean-Jacques Bouvier, owner of Natural Le Coultre, a 150-year-old company specialized in moving and storing goods. Yves Bouvier early developed an interest in art, and joined his father's company in the eighties.&lt;ref name=fr.worldtempus.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Le Coultre, le transport au sommet de son art depuis 150 ans|url=http://fr.worldtempus.com/article/culture/publiart-natural-coultre-transport-au-sommet-son-art-150-ans-326553|publisher=WorldTempus|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural Le Coultre==
Natural Transports was formed in 1859 as a moving and furniture storage company. It later became Natural Le Coultre &lt;ref name=fr.worldtempus.com /&gt; in 1901, when Albert-Maurice Natural joined Emile-Etienne Le Coultre to create A. Natural, Le Coultre &amp; Cie. In 1946, Jean-Jacques Bouvier began an apprenticeship at Natural Le Coultre S.A. In 1983, the Bouvier family acquired Natural Le Coultre. In 1989, Jean-Jacques and Yves Bouvier formed Fine Art Transports Natural Le Coultre SA in Geneva. Yves Bouvier became assistant manager in 1995 and then managing director in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rc.ge.ch/hrcintreport/createReport?rcentId=5750093500000066031025&amp;lang=FR&amp;order=R&amp;rad=Y |title=NATURAL LE COULTRE SA : inscrite le 24 janvier 1946 : Société anonyme |publisher=Rc.ge.ch |accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; selling the moving and furniture storage activities to a local company to focus the company on storing, moving, and preserving pieces of art.&lt;ref name=bilan.ch&gt;{{cite web|title=Ce visionnaire qui a parié sur l’Asie|url=http://www.bilan.ch/entreprises-les-plus-de-la-redaction/ce-visionnaire-qui-parie-sur-lasie|publisher=TIFFY&amp;CO.|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yves Bouvier moved to [[Singapore]] in 2009 where he currently resides.

==Freeport facilities==
In 2005, Bouvier expanded his business model abroad&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yves Bouvier: une ascension fulgurante dans le monde de l’art|url=http://www.letemps.ch/suisse/2015/02/26/yves-bouvier-une-ascension-fulgurante-monde-art|publisher=LE TEMPS SA|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by creating "artistic hubs" grouped into [[Free economic zone|freeport facilities]] that offer services and rental facilities to art collectors, museums and companies,&lt;ref name=bilan.ch /&gt; expanding into Singapore in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prystay|first1=Cris|title=Singapore Bling|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703691804575255551995870746|publisher=THE WALL STREET JOURNAL|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Luxembourg in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blenkinsop|first1=Philip|title=Luxembourg opens art freeport to lure super-rich|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/17/art-luxembourg-idUSL6N0RI3CI20140917#BoWIRCJtp64ezHY3.97|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are plans to open a [[Shanghai]] facility in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Le Coultre opens Shanghai artwork facility|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/1741776/natural-le-coultre-opens-shanghai-artwork-facility|publisher=South China Morning Post|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Rybolovlev case==

===Background===
For many years, Bouvier was known primarily as an art transporter. However, after 2010, he began to be associated with art sales, including some controversial cases involving alleged irregularities. First, in 2012 Bouvier was connected to a legal case involving a Canadian collector named Lorette Shefner. Shefner’s family claims that she was the victim of a complex fraud, whereby she was persuaded to sell a [[Chaim Soutine|Soutine]] painting at a price far below market value, only to see the work later sold to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington DC for a much higher price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Bouvier Shenanigans, Chapter Two: Steve Cohen|url = http://www.artsjournal.com/realcleararts/2015/03/bouvier-shenanigans-chapter-two-steve-cohen.html|website = Real Clear Arts|accessdate = 8 January 2016|language = en-US}} A 2013 law suit filed by the Shefner family in New York named Bouvier as a co-defendant with Paris-based Galerie Jacques de la Béraudière. Bouvier denies the claims against him, arguing that it is circumstantial and not based on any solid evidence. His lawyers have argued that there is no case to answer. The case remains pending.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cases.justia.com/new-york/other-courts/2013-ny-slip-op-32934-u.pdf?ts=1385072189 |title=Shefner v Jacques de la Beraudiere |website=Cases.justia.com |accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate incident, de la Béraudière was linked to the high-profile criminal case of [[Wolfgang Beltracchi]], a German [[Art forgery|forger]] convicted in 2011 of defrauding a number of collectors, including [[Daniel Filipacchi]], of millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The $7 Million Fake: Forgery Scandal Embarrasses International Art World|url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/the-7-million-fake-forgery-scandal-embarrasses-international-art-world-a-768195-2.html|newspaper =[[Der Spiegel]] |publisher=Spiegel Online|date = 2011-06-13|accessdate = 8 January 2016|first = Sven|last = Röbel|first2 = Michael|last2 = Sontheimer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bouvier’s purported connections to Galerie Jacques de la Béraudière and his ownership of an off-shore entity called Diva Fine Arts led to Bouvier being connected to the Beltracchi case. He has denied any connection to Beltracchi and dismissed media coverage as uninformed speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Steueroase: Freihäfen seien keine Schmuggler-Höhlen, beteuert Bouvier|url = http://www.zeit.de/2013/18/kunstmarkt-steueroase-yves-bouvier|website = ZEIT ONLINE|accessdate = 8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest and litigation===

On 26 February 2015, Yves Bouvier was arrested in [[Monaco]]. He was accused by Russian billionaire [[Dmitry Rybolovlev]] of defrauding him of hundreds of millions of dollars through the sale of 37 paintings over a ten-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frank|first1=Robert|title=Art scandal threatens to expose mass fraud in global art market|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/13/art-scandal-threatens-to-expose-mass-fraud-in-global-art-market.html|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mulholland|first1=Rory|title=Monaco FC owner Rybolovlev among alleged victims of huge art scam|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/monaco/11436640/Swiss-businessman-Yves-Bouvier-arrested-for-art-fraud.html|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bouvier denied all accusations, argues that he first heard about the complaint was when he was arrested, and that the price of the paintings had been agreed by both parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Peter|title=Multi-millionaire businessman who stores cars, wine, cigars and art treasures for the rich and famous is arrested in fraud case|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2970732/Multi-millionaire-businessman-Yves-Bouvier-stores-treasures-rich-famous-arrested-fraud-case.html|publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Forbes]], Rybolovlev spent New Year's Eve with Sandy Heller, art adviser to hedge fund billionaire [[Steven A. Cohen]]. Heller mentioned to Rybolovlev that Cohen had sold a [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]] nude for $93.5&amp;nbsp;million to a "mystery buyer", alleging he didn’t know that the buyer was Bouvier. Rybolvlev had paid Bouvier $118&amp;nbsp;million. Rybolovlev filed for fraud and money laundering in Monaco nine days later, and persuaded Bouvier to meet him there to discuss payment details for a [[Mark Rothko]] painting, at which time he was arrested by eight policemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fontevecchia|first1=Agustino|title=Steve Cohen's Modigliani In The Middle Of An Art Market War: Billionaire Rybolovlev vs Yves Bouvier|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2015/03/12/steve-cohens-modigliani-in-the-middle-of-an-art-market-war-billionaire-rybolovlev-vs-yves-bouvier/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomberg.com&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Hugo|last2=Baker|first2=Stephanie|title=The Billionaire, the Dealer, and the $186 Million Rothko|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-27/a-186-million-rothko-pits-russian-tycoon-against-art-merchant|publisher=Bloomberg Business|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 2015, Singapore's High Court ordered the global freezing of Bouvier’s assets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore court orders asset freeze on 'Freeport King'|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/13/us-singapore-court-idUSKBN0M90RH20150313|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; then lifted this decision 12 days later, ordering Rybolovlev to give a total of $100m guarantee of damages from his action against Bouvier, $20m in cash and an $80m guarantee on the Rothko No. 6 painting.&lt;ref name=bloomberg.com /&gt; On 21 August 2015, the Singapore Court of Appeal removed the freezing injunction, on the ground that the procedure launched by Rybolovlev amounted to an abuse of procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perlson|first1=Hili|title=Singapore Court of Appeal Unfreezes Yves Bouvier's Assets|url=https://news.artnet.com/people/singapore-unfreezes-yves-bouviers-assets-327141|publisher=artnetnews|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, the High Court of Singapore dismissed Bouvier's attempt to suspend the civil suit filed in the territory against him by two companies linked to the Rybolovlev family trust, but the case was transferred to the Singapore International Commercial Court, which deals specifically with cross-border commercial disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/spore-court-to-hear-14b-art-suit|title=Singapore court to hear $1.4b art suit|last=hermes|website=The Straits Times|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, in an effort to gain a friendlier hearing, Bouvier’s lawyers filed an appeal against the High Court's ruling. Bouvier prefers to have the case heard in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-31/art-world-s-1-billion-question-was-russian-a-victim-or-savant|publisher=bloomberg.com|title=Art’s $1 Billion Question: Was Russian a Victim or Savant? - Bloomberg|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 April 2017, the Singapore Court of Appeal overturned the High Court's decision, ruling that the case should be heard in Switzerland and ordering the action in Singapore to be stayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/apex-court-says-no-to-art-dispute-being-heard-here|title=Apex court says no to art dispute being heard here|last=hermes|website=The Straits Times|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Rybolovlev had successfully obtained an injunction from Hong Kong’s High Court in July 2015, on 4 September, Bouvier had his assets in Hong Kong unfrozen. High Court recorder Jason Pow Wing-nin SC ordered the injunction against art dealer Bouvier and his Hong Kong company Mei Invest Limited to be lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/1855225/swiss-art-dealer-accused-raking-us1b-secret-profits-sales|title=Swiss art dealer's Hong Kong assets unfrozen amid court battle with Russian tycoon who accused him of swindling|website=Scmp.com|date=4 September 2015|author=Julie Chu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irregularities were found in Rybolovlev’s complaint against Bouvier: Rybolovlev, who had served eleven months in jail after his involvement in the murder of Evgeny Panteleymonov, was suspected of collusion with several senior Monegasque officials. Some believe he plotted against Bouvier with the help of Philippe Narmino, Minister of Justice, and Jean-Pierre Dreno, Prosecutor of Monaco.&lt;ref name=mediapart.fr&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duparc|first1=Agathe|title=Le milliardaire russe Rybolovlev compte de puissants relais monégasques|url=https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/economie/290615/le-milliardaire-russe-rybolovlev-compte-de-puissants-relais-monegasques|publisher=MEDIAPART|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; French newspapers [[Mediapart]] and [[Libération]] suggested that during a dinner in [[Gstaad]], Rybolovlev, Narmino and Gérard Cohen may have discussed the details of the plot, only a few weeks before Bouvier was arrested.&lt;ref name=mediapart.fr /&gt; Additionally, [[HSBC]] has been accused of forgery and falsification of records that led to Bouvier's arrest in Monaco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Letzing|first1=John|title=Russian Billionaire’s Battle With Art Dealer Draws In HSBC|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-billionaires-battle-with-art-dealer-draws-in-hsbc-1447971694|publisher=THE WALL STREET JOURNAL|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bouvier's defense has objected to Rybolovlev's lawyer, Tetiana Bersheda, serving as Rybolovlev's translator during questioning while also being the subject of a deposition as a witness in the same case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yves Bouvier et sa complice precontre attaquent|url=https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/2015/07/15/yves-bouvier-complice-presumee-contre-attaquent|publisher=LE TEMPS|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former friend of the Rybolovlev family, Tania Rappo, was also charged alongside Bouvier, in her case with money laundering in relation to the fraud. Rappo later alleged that Tetiana Bersheda, lawyer of Rybolovlev, registered at the bar of Geneva, recorded a private conversation without authorization in order to obtain information that might help secure an indictment. However, Bersheda maintains that the recording was of a professional conversation only and, as such, permitted by Monaco law. In any event, the Monaco Justice has yet to make any decision in relation to Rappo's complaint and the charges against Rappo, based partly on the content of the conversation, remain pending.&lt;ref name="tdg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdg.ch/economie/tetiana-bersheda-c-nouvelle-manuvre/story/21809879|publisher=tdg.ch|title=Marché de l’art: Tetiana Bersheda: "C'est une nouvelle manœuvre" - Économie - tdg.ch|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 February 2016, Bersheda was also charged by Monaco court for violation of the privacy of Rappo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monacolife.net/?action=show&amp;id=4974|title=Lawyer for ASM owner in court today|website=Monacolife.net|date=23 February 2016|author=Ian Brodie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dmitry Rybolovlev and his lawyer might be sentenced to up to 3 years of imprisonment.

On 14 September 2015, Bouvier was indicted on charges of concealed theft of two [[Picasso]]s belonging to Catherine Hutin-Blay, step-daughter of Picasso, who claims that they were stolen from her collection. However, Bouvier demonstrated she received the amount of 8&amp;nbsp;million euros through a Liechtensteiner trust for their sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bellet|first1=Harry|title=L’homme d’affaires Yves Bouvier mis en examen pour recel de deux Picasso volés|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/arts/article/2015/09/15/l-homme-d-affaires-yves-bouvier-mis-en-examen-pour-recel-de-deux-picasso-voles_4757968_1655012.html|publisher=LeMonde.fr|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution of Liechtenstein closed the case on 1 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdg.ch/economie/Vaduz-classe-une-plainte-pour-blanchiment-visant-Yves-Bouvier/story/29735335|title=Vaduz classe une plainte pour blanchiment visant Yves Bouvier|website=Tdg.ch|date=18 December 2015|author=Pierre-Alexandre Sallier|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, Bouvier took legal action in [[New York (state)|New York]] against the consultant Sandy Heller, asking that he be questioned about his interactions with Rybolovlev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Letzing|first1=John|title=Russian Oligarch’s Legal Battle Entangles U.S. Art Consultant|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-oligarchs-legal-battle-over-painting-entangles-u-s-art-consultant-1443362544|publisher=THE WALLSTREET JOURNAL|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bouvier wants Heller to reveal the advice he may have provided to Rybolovlev that may have unfairly implicated him in the criminal cases he currently faces in France and Monaco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theartnewspaper.com/market/yves-bouvier-pushes-to-have-new-york-art-consultant-s-dealings-revealed-in-us-court/|title=Yves Bouvier pushes to have New York art consultant’s dealings revealed in US court|website=Theartnewspaper.com|language=en-GB|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major article about the Bouvier Affair published in [[the New Yorker]] in February 2016 alleged that Bouvier was using the profits from his dealings with Rybolovlev to fund his ambitious plans for the Singapore Freeport. The article quotes a colleague of Bouvier as saying, "...to build freeports you need to be a billionaire...Rybolovlev was the billionaire whose money was building the freeports." As to Bouvier's method of marking-up the price of the works he was selling, the article found that "When a deal with the seller was in sight, Bouvier would then agree on his own price with Rybolovlev, which was often tens of millions of dollars higher," and provided the example of the sale of Picasso's ''Joueur de Flûte et Femme Nue'', which Bouvier sold to Rybolovlev for twenty-five million euros after having bought it the day before for just three and a half million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/08/the-bouvier-affair|title=The Bouvier Affair|date=15 February 2016|author=Sam Knight|website=Newyorker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 9, 2016, following the lead of European authorities, US Federal prosecutors opened an investigation into Bouvier, whom they described as "one of the art world’s consummate insiders."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-09/the-da-vinci-markup-europe-s-art-scandal-comes-to-america|title=The Da Vinci Markup?

In November 2016, Sotheby's issued a pre-emptive suit in relation to the [[Salvator Mundi (Leonardo)]] painting, denying that it had ever been part of a scheme allegedly perpetrated by Bouvier to defraud both the sellers of the painting, and Rybolovlev.&lt;ref name="artnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/sothebys-bouvier-rybolovlev-758348|publisher=news.artnet.com|title=Sotheby's Denies Helping Flip Bouvier's $127.5 Million Leonardo|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Times'' subsequently published a major investigative report into the sale, asking whether the sellers of the Salvator Mundi "were misled [by Sotheby's] to favor the Swiss dealer, a valued Sotheby’s client named Yves Bouvier."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/arts/design/sothebys-tries-to-block-suit-over-a-leonardo-sold-and-resold-at-a-big-markup.html|publisher=nytimes.com|title=Sotheby’s Tries to Block Suit Over a Leonardo Sold and Resold at a Big Markup - The New York Times|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, it emerged in a report carried by Bloomberg that several of the works acquired by Yves Bouvier for the Rybolovlev family trust will likely be sold at substantial losses in auctions at Christie's.&lt;ref name="bloomberg2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-02-23/a-100-million-mystery-a-russian-his-art-and-his-big-losses|publisher=bloomberg.com|title=A $100 Million Mystery: A Russian, His Art, and His Big Losses - Bloomberg|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rybolovlev's spokesman said at the time: "The gulf between Christie’s estimates and the original purchase prices of the works is a further illustration of the unprecedented scale and audacity of the fraud that the plaintiffs allege was perpetrated by Mr. Bouvier."

In September 2017 it was reported that Swiss inland revenue blocked assets of Bouvier, as he is believed to owe CHF 165 Million in taxes [https://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/bundesstrafgericht-genfer-kunsthaendler-soll-165-millionen-franken-an-steuern-schulden-id7257042.html]

In 2004 Bouvier founded the company Art Culture Studio that organizes cultural events, restores furniture, and provides support to the Renaissance Foundation for Russian Country Homes, a non-profit organization that supports research on the restoration of cultural and historic buildings in rural areas.. He initiated and chaired the [[Moscow]] World Fine Art and the [[Salzburg]] World Fine Art Fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salzburg World Fine Art Fair To Open July 27|url=http://artdaily.com/news/21038/Salzburg-World-Fine-Art-Fair-To-Open-July-27#.VlJOGlUvfnB|publisher=artdaily|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Bouvier initiated the creation of the Singapore Pinacothèque de Paris, an expansion of  [[Pinacothèque de Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Changy|first1=Florence|title=Singapour a désormais sa Pinacothèque de Paris|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/arts/article/2015/06/04/singapour-a-desormais-sa-pinacotheque-de-paris_4647357_1655012.html|publisher=LeMonde.fr|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to its website, "The museum in Singapore mirrors that of France, a fine art museum known for its critically acclaimed exhibitions that celebrate transversality and the dialogue between different works of art".

Bouvier was involved with the "pôle R4" project, an artistic "micro-city" on the site of a former Renault factory in [[Seguin Island]], Paris. The project, designed by French architect [[Jean Nouvel]], was until September 2016 managed and financed by Bouvier, and was scheduled to open in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lankarani|first1=Nazanin|title=A New Concept in Handling Art|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/10/arts/10iht-rcartoff.html?_r=1|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016 it was announced that Bouvier had sold his entire stake to the Emerige Group and its financial partner, Addax and Oryx Group Limited (AOG).&lt;ref name="news.artnet.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/paris-r4-new-financial-backer-648308|publisher=news.artnet.com|title=Paris' R4 Finds New Financial Backer – artnet News|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="24heures"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.24heures.ch/economie/yves-bouvier-abandonne-projet-parisien-r4/story/10362656|publisher=24heures.ch|title=Transaction: Yves Bouvier abandonne le projet parisien R4 - Économie - 24heures.ch|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artnet noted that the transaction frees the project from its association from Bouvier.&lt;ref name="news.artnet.com"/&gt;
