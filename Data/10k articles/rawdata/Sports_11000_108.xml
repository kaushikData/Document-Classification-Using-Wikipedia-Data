The '''2017 CrossFit Games''' are the eleventh [[CrossFit Games]] and were held on August 3–6, 2017, at the [[Alliant Energy Center]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rodio|first1=Michael|title=Why the CrossFit Games Are Moving to Madison, Wisconsin|url=http://www.mensfitness.com/life/entertainment/why-crossfit-games-are-moving-madison-wisconsin|work=Men's Fitness|date=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GAMES GO TO MADISON|url=https://games.crossfit.com/announcement/9870|website=CrossFit.com|date=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first Games held outside the state of [[California]]. It was also the first year for the Masters 35–39 division.

The men's competition was won by [[Mathew Fraser]], the women's by [[Tia-Clair Toomey]], and Wasatch CrossFit won the Affiliate Cup.  Fraser won $309,000 for his efforts and Toomey won $298,000 for her title, as prize money includes both the $285,000 for winning and bonus money ($3,000 for winning, $2,000 for second, and $1,000 for third) in each event.{{cn|date=July 2018}} This was the first CrossFit Games in which a podium finisher in the Individual competition was disqualified for using illegal performance-enhancing substances when Ricky Garard tested positive after the Games were complete.&lt;ref name="DISQUALIFIED"/&gt; As the Games had already concluded, all his finishes were simply voided with all other competitors moving up one position in the final standings as the event points were not redistributed.

====Event 2: Cyclocross====
*3 laps around a [[cyclocross]] course
The event was held nearby in Quann Park and had bikes supplied by Wisconsin-based [[Trek Bicycle Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cxmagazine.com/interview-cyclocross-crossfit-games-2017-madison-wisconsin |title=INTERVIEW: HOW CYCLOCROSS BECAME A PART OF THE 2017 CROSSFIT GAMES |publisher=''Cyclocross Magazine'' |date=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course's obstacles included logs, small wooden hurdles and a sand trap. The event was won by Ricky Garard*&lt;ref name= Garard&gt;Garard won this event prior to being disqualified. The points were not redistributed, the first place position for the event was voided, and no other event winner was named in his place.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kristin Holte.

====Event 3: Amanda .45====
*13–11–9–7–5 repetitions of [[pull-up (exercise)#Variations|muscle-ups]] and [[Snatch (weightlifting)|squat snatches]] for time.
Athletes performed 13 muscle-ups on [[gymnastic rings]] and then 13 snatches, followed by 11 muscle-ups and 11 snatches, etc. until finishing the sets of 5. This is a variation of the event "Amanda" introduced at the [[2010 CrossFit Games]] as a tribute to former Games athlete, Amanda Miller, who died in 2010 and was known for the pistol tattoos on her hips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.beyondthewhiteboard.com/2016/09/08/amanda-the-woman-the-wod/ |title=Amanda: The Woman &amp; The WOD |work=Beyond the Whiteboard |date=September 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was won by Dakota Rager for the men and by Jamie Greene for the women.

===Friday, August 4, 2017===
====Event 4: Sprint O-Course====
*[[Obstacle course]] race
Competitors raced head-to-head in three rounds across an obstacle course consisting of a [[cargo net]] climb, wall climb, [[monkey bars]], log balances, and a [[Ladder#Flexible ladders|rope ladder]]. The event was won by Patrick Vellner and Tennil Reed-Beuerlein.

====Event 5: 1RM Snatch====
*1-rep max [[Snatch (weightlifting)|snatch]]
The event was won by Garret Fisher with a 305-pound lift and Kara Webb with a 203-pound lift.

*80 GHD [[sit-up]]s
*60 alternating [[Squat (exercise)#Bodyweight|one-legged squats]]
*40-calorie [[Indoor rower|row]]
*20 [[dumbbell]] [[push press]]
The event was a "chipper," a workout involving multiple exercises done sequentially without returning (as in "chipping away" at the number of repetitions) for the fastest time. After the 100 pull-ups, the competitors performed 80 sit-ups on a glute-hamstring developer (GHD), a piece of equipment where the feet lock in and the sit-up is performed at a greater range of motion. After the sit-ups, athletes performed 60 one-legged squats, also called [[Squat (exercise)#Bodyweight|"pistols"]], alternating the movement between each leg. The 40-calorie row was performed on a [[Concept2|Concept-2]] [[rowing machine]]. The dumbbells for the [[push press]] were 100-pounds for the men and 70-pounds for the women. The event was won by [[Mathew Fraser]] and Kara Webb.

====Event 7: Assault Banger====
*[[Indoor cycling|Assault AirBike]] for calories
*20-foot Banger
The competitors started on the Assault bike and the calories were 40 for men and 30 for women. After the bike, the athletes used a [[sledgehammer]] to hit a weighted block on a recessed track until it had moved 20 feet. The event was won by George Sanchez and [[Samantha Briggs]].

===Saturday, August 5, 2017===
====Event 8: Strongman's Fear====
*Move a yoke, farmer's logs, and a sled across a field. Return down the field in a handstand walk
Competitors had to move a series of [[Strength athletics|strongman]] elements; a [[yoke]] (500 pounds for men, 340 pounds for women), two [[Strength athletics#Common disciplines|farmer's logs]] (200 pounds each for men, 120 pounds each for women), and a sled (400 pounds for men, 310 pounds for women). The objects had to be taken halfway down the field (60 feet) and then the competitor returned using a handstand walk. Once all objects were at the halfway mark, the competitors took the objects to the end of the field, also returning to the middle of the field with a handstand walk. The objects could be moved in any order. Brent Fikowski won the event for the men and [[Katrín Davíðsdóttir|Katrin Tanja Davidsdottir]] for the women.

====Event 9: Muscle-up Clean Ladder====
*Eight rounds for time of:
**4 [[pull-up (exercise)#Variations|bar muscle-ups]]
**2 [[Clean and Jerk#Clean|cleans]] with ascending weight
Competitors performed each round beginning with four muscle-ups on a pull-up bar followed by two cleans. After each round the weight increased starting with 225 pounds for the men and 145 pounds for the women and ending with 350 and 235 pounds, respectively. Mathew Fraser won the event for the men and Tia-Clair Toomey won for the women.

====Event 10: Heavy 17.5====

**9 thrusters
**35 double-unders
A heavier version of a previous Open qualifier event in 2017. A [[Jumping rope#Double under|double-under]] is a jumping rope movement where the rope passes beneath the athlete twice per jump. A thruster in CrossFit is a combination of a [[front squat]] and [[push press]] in one continuous movement and the weights were 125 pounds for the men and 85 pounds for the women. Mathew Fraser won for the men and Kara Webb won for the women.

===Sunday, August 6, 2017===

====Event 11: Madison Triplet====
5 rounds for time of:
*450 meter run
*7 [[Hay#Small bales|hay bale]] clean [[Burpee (exercise)|burpee]]s

Athletes ran around a 450-meter path outside of the stadium. In the stadium, there were five rows of hay bale walls. The athletes would enter the stadium and clean a [[sandbag]] up and toss it over the hay bale wall. They would then perform a burpee and then jump over the wall. The hay bale clean burpee would be performed seven times at the same hay bale wall before moving the sandbag to the next wall. After the sandbag is moved, the athletes ran back to the path to make another lap. The sandbags were 100 pounds for the men and 70 pounds for the women. The event was won by Ricky Garard*&lt;ref name= Garard/&gt; for the men and [[Samantha Briggs]] for the women.

====Event 12: 2223 Intervals====
4 rounds of:
*2 rope climbs
*10/7-calorie SkiErg
*Maximum repetitions of overhead squats with remaining time

This was an interval event with the first three rounds consisting of two minutes of work and then one minute of rest. The final round was three minutes of work to get as many overhead squats as possible or a total of 75 through all rounds for time. For each round, competitors started with two 20-foot rope climbs. After the rope climbs, the competitors pulled 10 calories for men and 7 calories for women on a [[Concept2#SkiErg|SkiErg]], a machine built by [[Concept2]] similar to their rowing machines but meant to simulate a [[Cross-country skiing (sport)|cross-country skiing]] motion. With the remaining time in each interval, they accumulated as many squats as they could with 155 pounds for the men and 105 pounds for the women. The event was won by Mathew Fraser and [[Katrín Tanja Davíðsdóttir]].

====Event 13: Fibonacci Final====
Men:
*5 [[Parallette]] [[handstand push-up]]s
*5 [[Deadlift]]s with two 203-pound [[kettlebell]]s
*8 Parallette handstand push-ups
*8 Kettlebell deadlifts
*13 Parallette handstand push-ups

On the women's side, Kara Webb had been in second-place overall below Tia-Clair Toomey. She edged out Toomey on the event by 0.19 seconds but did not overtake her in total points, finishing two points behind on the final standings.

'''Accrington Stanley, Who Are They?''' is a slogan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.skysports.com/opinion/story/0,25212,16711_6393275,00.html |title=Who are they? |publisher=Sky Sports |date=2010-09-22 |accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was used in an advert for milk by the [[Milk Marketing Board]] in the 1980s in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uktvadverts.com/Home/Search.aspx?advert=5632|title=Milk Delivery|work=UK TV Adverts|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eighty&gt;{{cite web|last=Charles |first=Chris |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/accrington_stanley/5236018.stm |title=Accrington Stanley, who are they? |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2006-08-03 |accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advert starred [[Carl Rice]] and Kevin Staine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Shennan | first = Paddy | author-link = | date = 3 September 2013 | title = Boy from The White Stuff; Paddy Shennan talks to the actor who made his TV debut as a pint-sized Reds' fan | periodical = Liverpool Echo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advert ==
The advert features two young [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] fans with one telling the other that [[Ian Rush]] had told him that if he didn't drink milk, he would only be good enough to play for [[Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley]]. The other fan then said "Accrington Stanley, who are they?" with the response being "Exactly."&lt;ref name=eighty /&gt; According to Rice, [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] was originally going to be named. However, Tottenham objected, so Accrington Stanley were chosen instead&lt;ref name=milkstar /&gt; as they were a [[Non-League football|non-League]] team at the time&lt;ref name=milkstar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/4788038.stm |title=Accrington thank milk advert star |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-03-09 |accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were seen to be a more obscure team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloxham |first=Andy |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8579796/Writer-upsets-Accrington-with-description-of-unlovely-town.html |title=Writer upsets Accrington with description of 'unlovely' town |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was also claimed by [[David Lloyd (cricketer)|David Lloyd]], a non executive director of Accrington Stanley, that the advert earned the club £10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Newman |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2112308/David-Bumble-Lloyd-Talking-passionately-Accrington-Stanley.html |title=David 'Bumble' Lloyd: Talking passionately about Accrington Stanley |publisher=Daily Mail |date=2012-03-09 |accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The advert was popular, and was continually shown for up to six years after it was originally made in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Laura Sharpe |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/accringtonobserver/news/s/510311_milk_ad_kid_backs_reds |title=Milk ad kid backs Reds |publisher=Accrington Observer |date=2006-03-09 |accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was seen to make Accrington Stanley the subject of jokes up to the present day.&lt;ref name=tele/&gt; However, residents of [[Accrington]] view the reference positively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simpson |first=Mark |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4889362.stm |title=The club that wouldn't die |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-04-07 |accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Delano-Hitch Stadium''' is a [[stadium]] in [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]], [[New York (state)|New York]]; it has a current capacity of 3,100.

==Early years==
Baseball in Newburgh goes back to the 1860s: the '''Hudson River''' club played from 1863–67, compiling an 18-18 record against many of the top teams of the day. Several other short-lived pro teams called the city home before [[World War I]], including the '''Newburgh Taylor-Mades''' (aka '''Hill Climbers''' or '''Hillies''', Hudson River League, 1903–1907); the '''Newburgh Dutchmen''' (New York-New Jersey League, 1913) and the '''Newburgh Hillclimbers''' (Atlantic League, 1914).

In 1916, Mrs. Annie Delano Hitch (aunt of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]) donated land to the City of Newburgh for a "driving park", later known as Delano-Hitch Recreation Park. The stadium was opened in 1926, and has been primarily used for [[baseball]]. Four professional teams have called Delano-Hitch home: the [[Newburgh Hummingbirds]] in 1946, the Newburgh Nighthawks in 1995-96, the [[Newburgh Black Diamonds]] in 1998, and the Newburgh Newts briefly in 2015.

{{See also|Newburgh Hummingbirds}}

==Later use==
During the next half-century, the stadium was used by various amateur and semi-pro baseball teams, as well as by the semi-pro [[American football|football]] '''Newburgh Raiders''' from 1991-96. (Despite winning four Empire Football League championships, the EFL unanimously voted to boot Newburgh out in 1997 for a variety of reasons, including the fact that Delano-Hitch wasn't really suitable for football.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110517/SPORTS/105170328]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1995-96 Newburgh Nighthawks==
In 1995, owner Bill Cummings brought the '''Newburgh Nighthawks''' to town, as a franchise in the new [[Northeast League]] (now the [[Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball|Can-Am League]]). Despite decent attendance figures of about 1,000 per game, Cummings lost over $30,000 and sold the team to Jeff Kunion. The '96 Nighthawks won the NEL first half championship and played the [[Albany-Colonie Diamond Dogs]] for the league title, losing three games to one. The final game of the championship series proved to be the last Nighthawks' game ever, as Kunion, unsatisfied with the pace of stadium renovations, folded the team.

==1998 Newburgh Black Diamonds==
After sitting empty in 1997, the stadium got a new team for 1998: the [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball|Atlantic League]]'s '''[[Newburgh Black Diamonds]]'''. However, poor attendance and the league's displeasure with Delano-Hitch's condition sealed Newburgh's fate, despite $150,000 worth of renovations. Minutes before Newburgh's home opener, league president [[Bud Harrelson]] announced the Black Diamonds would return in 1999, but only if the team built a new stadium. Instead, the franchise was sent wandering for several years after a [[Lehigh Valley Multi-Purpose Sport Complex|proposed stadium]] in [[Easton, Pennsylvania]] was left unfinished after the builders went bankrupt; the team existed as the [[Road Warriors (Atlantic League)|Road Warriors]] through 2004, then again in 2006-07.

==21st century==
Recently, Delano-Hitch has been used for amateur baseball, including high school ([[Newburgh Free Academy]]), college ([[Mount Saint Mary College]]), collegiate league ([[New York Generals (ACBL)|New York Generals]]) and [[American Legion]] ball. The financial downturn, however, has made it difficult for these teams to afford the rent on the stadium; since 2009, the ballpark has mostly sat empty, except for non-athletic gatherings. On August 7, 2010, Marcus Gill Ministries held a crusade, "Unity Fest with Minister Marcus Gill". About 150 people attended the crusade, held to encourage the community to pray for peace and to end crime in Newburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unity Fest|url=http://hudsonvalley.ynn.com/content/512740/unityfest-offered-as-alternative-to-gangs/|accessdate=15 November 2011|newspaper=YNN|date=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unity Fest Crusade with Marcus Gill|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100808/NEWS/8080332&amp;cid=sitesearch|accessdate=15 November 2011|newspaper=The Record|date=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the '''Newburgh Nuclears''' [[American Legion]] team returned to Delano-Hitch for a series of home games and tournaments, after raising $13,000 for the use of the facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110517/SPORTS/105170328]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Newburgh Newts==
In 2015, Delano-Hitch was briefly the home of the '''Newburgh Newts''' of the [[North Country Baseball League]]. One of the new league's founding franchises, the Newts' first home game was played May 20 against the [[Watertown, New York|Watertown Bucks]], kicking off a planned 66-game schedule that was to run through early August.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newtsbaseball.com/team-schedule.html&lt;/ref&gt; After a series of tiny crowds of around twenty customers per game, the Newts were evicted from Delano-Hitch after three weeks, when their rent check bounced.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.recordonline.com/article/20150725/SPORTS/150729579&lt;/ref&gt; The franchise continued to operate as a road team (apparently renamed the '''New York Newts''', according to the league website), one of two in the four-team circuit. Despite a slow start and being forced to play all of their contests on the road, the Newts finished 22-17, good enough for a first-place tie with the league's other road team, the Road City Explorers.

In early August, the Newts won the NCBL championship, sweeping Watertown in a two-game series. The Newts apparently folded after that, as they were not invited to join the four-team [[Empire Professional Baseball League]] in 2016.

'''Dwyer Stadium''' is a 2,600 capacity [[stadium]] in [[Batavia, New York]], situated in [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee County]].  Dwyer opened in 1996 replacing the original stadium that was built in 1937, the playing field at Dwyer is the original.  The stadium is currently home to the [[Batavia Muckdogs]] - Class-A short season affiliate of the [[Miami Marlins]];  [[Genesee Community College]] Cougars - NJCAA;  and high school teams including the Notre Dame of Batavia Fighting Irish and Batavia Blue Devils.

==History==
The grandstand and surrounding structure of Dwyer Stadium may be new but the field and area hold over 70 years of professional baseball history.  Originally built in 1939 the stadium underwent three names and stood until 1995 when being replaced by the new stadium, keeping the previous name.

===State Street Park (1939-WWII)===
State Street Park was built in 1939 and employed 17 local workers to construct.  During the first season of play the stadium went unfinished and a snow fence had to be placed for each game to act as the outfield wall while chairs had to be borrowed from a local mortuary for seating.  The works project continued through the first season but did not deter fans as 3,000, still a record for Batavia, attended the first game of professional baseball at State Street Park.

===MacArthur Stadium (WWII-1972)===
During World War II the name was changed to MacArthur Stadium after General Douglas MacArthur in an act of patriotism.

===Dwyer Stadium (Original - 1973-1995)===
Before the 1973 season the stadium found its final name, Dwyer Stadium, after Edward D. Dwyer, a long time team president that was instrumental in keeping the team in Batavia.  The stadium was a wooden and covered grandstand that was famous in old time ballparks.

===Dwyer Stadium (1996–present)===
In 1995, it was officially announced Batavia would be getting a new $3 million stadium on the same location; the field would remain intact while the grandstand and seating would be torn down and replaced.  Auburn and Batavia each got a stadium that was almost carbon copies of one another.  The old Dwyer Stadium still has its place in the new stadium as the original Wall of Fame is still present behind the first base bleachers.

==Usage==
Dwyer Stadium is primarily used for [[baseball]], though has also been home to area youth football as well throughout its history.   Dwyer is the home field of the [[Batavia Muckdogs]] [[minor league]] baseball team, Short-Season Class-A affiliate of the [[Miami Marlins]] and also hosts college games during the spring and fall for the [[Genesee Community College]] Cougars as well as local high school games in the spring.

===Empire State Yankees===
During the 2012 season the Triple-A affiliate of the [[New York Yankees]], the [[Scranton Wilkes-Barre Yankees]], were scheduled to play seven games at Dwyer Stadium as the Yankees home stadium [[PNC Field]] in [[Moosic]], [[Pennsylvania]] underwent renovations.  Before the scheduled games the [[New York Yankees]] made improvements to the infield and pitchers mound as well as the clubhouse.  Due to weather conditions only four Triple-A games were played at Dwyer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2231">A '''four-point field goal''' (also called a '''four-pointer''') is a [[Field goal (basketball)|field goal]] in a [[basketball]] game made from a part of the court designated for a four-point shot, the designated area is typically farther from the basket than the three-point arc. A successful attempt is worth four points, in contrast to the three points awarded for a shot beyond the three point line, two points awarded for field goals made within the three-point line and the one point for each made [[free throw]]. 

The four-pointer was introduced in competition by the [[Harlem Globetrotters]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/basketball/2016/09/22/harlem-globetrotters-basketball-four-point-line/90863242/ Harlem Globetrotters Add a Four-Point Line]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[BIG3]] basketball league is the only current professional league that uses the four-point field goal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2017/06/26/big-3-ice-cube-mike-bibby-3-on-3-allen-iverson/429165001/ BIG3 Week 1 Recap]&lt;/ref&gt; In BIG3, there are three distinct circles beyond the three-point arc designated as a four-point field goal area. A four-point field goal is attempted when a player shoots with any part of the player's body touching any part of the four-point circle. &lt;ref&gt;[https://big3.com/league-philosophy/rules-the-court BIG3 Rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Galen Center''' is a multipurpose indoor [[arena]] and athletic facility owned and operated by the [[University of Southern California]]. Located at the southeast corner of [[Jefferson Boulevard]] and [[Figueroa Street]] in the [[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park]] area of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States]], it is right across the street from the [[campus]] and near the [[Shrine Auditorium]]. The Galen Center is the home of the [[USC Trojans basketball (disambiguation)|USC Trojans basketball]] and [[USC Trojans women's volleyball|USC volleyball]]; in addition it hosts [[concert]]s, [[beauty contest|pageants]], theatrical performances, [[high school]] [[graduation]] ceremonies, [[California Interscholastic Federation|CIF]] championships and the [[Academic Decathlon]]. The annual [[Kids' Choice Awards]] were held here from 2011 to 2014, and returned in 2017.

==History==
[[File:11-11-06-GalenCenter-inside.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Interior during an exhibition basketball game against [[Cal Poly Pomona Broncos|Cal Poly Pomona]]]]
USC had planned to build an on-campus indoor arena for more than 100 years.  Before the Galen Center, USC basketball had been played at a variety of locations, including the neighboring [[Shrine Auditorium]] stage, the old [[Pan-Pacific Auditorium]] in the [[Fairfax District, Los Angeles, California|Fairfax District]], and from 1959 onward at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]].

The final push to build the new facility began in 2002, when [[Louis Galen]], a successful banker and longtime Trojan fan, and his wife Helene donated $10 million to the new center immediately after USC football [[quarterback]] [[Carson Palmer]] won the 2002 [[Heisman Trophy]].  The Galens donated an additional $25 million to the project to have the building named after them and later upped their donation an additional $15 million to make sure that a connected practice facility would also bear their name, bringing the total donation to $50 million.  Previously, the USC men's and women's basketball teams practiced at the smaller, on-campus North Gym. The Galen Center replaced the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] as the home for USC men's and women's basketball.

Galen Center [[construction]] cost an estimated $147 million, which includes the arena, team offices, and a state-of-the-art practice facility.  The largest [[tax]] revenue would be generated by the city of Los Angeles' 10% parking tax. Other sources of tax revenue will include [[sales tax]], utility users tax, business license tax, and income from [[advertising]].  In addition, two new [[parking structure]]s were built: a 1,200-space structure located between the [[Radisson Hotels|Radisson Hotel]] and the arena, with access from Flower Street, and a second structure at the southeast corner of Figueroa Street and Exposition Boulevard.  The additional parking structures also increased the available parking for both the USC campus and the nearby [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]].
[[File:11-11-06-UO-010t.jpg|thumb|left|190px|View of [[Downtown Los Angeles]] from the Galen Center's unique window]]
[[File:GalenCenter1.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Building exterior]]

The [[architect]]ural firm behind the design of the Galen Center is [[HNTB]]. Construction officially began on October 31, 2004, with a groundbreaking [[ceremony]] including [[Los Angeles City Council]] members [[Bernard Parks]] and [[Jan Perry]] along with Helene and Louis Galen, longtime USC fans for whom the facility is named.

The first event, a women's volleyball game between USC and [[Stanford University]], took place on October 12, 2006.  The first concert at the center was October 21, 2006 and featured Al Green. The first men's basketball was held on November 16 against the [[South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball|University of South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2006-07 USC Men's Basketball Schedule Announced|url=http://www.usctrojans.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/071406aao.html|publisher=USC Athletics|date=July 14, 2006|accessdate=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=South Carolina 80, USC 74 (OT)|url=http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=263200030|work=[[ESPN]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 16, 2006|accessdate=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first sellout crowd was the men's basketball game against the [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA Bruins]] on January 12, 2007 with an attendance of 9,682.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=No. 4 UCLA 65, Southern California 64|first=Beth|last=Harris|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaab/recap?gid=200701130609|work=[[Yahoo!

==Jim Sterkel Court==
[[File:GalenCenter2.jpg|thumb|right|Interior, with premium seating on third Level]]

The Galen Center's [[basketball court]] was named after former USC basketball player Jim Sterkel, who played for the [[USC Trojans|Trojans]] for two seasons in the 1950s, averaging 10 points a game. Two unique factors in the [[naming rights]] were the obscurity of the name choice and that the Sterkel family was not aware that the court was named after the late Jim Sterkel until after the facility had already opened.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} B. Wayne Hughes, a longtime friend of Sterkel's made the $5 million donation under the agreement that his name never be revealed. In an interview with ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' columnist [[Bill Plaschke]], who tracked down Hughes but did not reveal his name, 'Anonymous' said that he grew up with Sterkel: both attended [[Mark Keppel High School]], both began at USC in 1955 and were roommates. 'Anonymous' later hired Sterkel and helped pay for his treatment when Sterkel was diagnosed with cancer. When the son of the anonymous donor contracted [[leukemia]], Sterkel wrote a poem and sealed it to be read only when the son had died. Sterkel later died in 1997, with the son dying two years later. Inspired by the poem and his friendship with Sterkel, 'Anonymous' made the donation and named the court after his friend, saying, "Some people don't deserve to be forgotten."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Floored|first=Bill|last=Plaschke|author-link=Bill Plaschke|url=http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/stories/13228.html|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 5, 2006|accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facility information==
The facility is {{convert|255000|sqft|m2}}, with a {{convert|45000|sqft|m2}} pavilion, and has three practice courts and offices. The [[seating capacity]] is 10,258, and there are 22 [[Privacy|private]] [[suite (address)|suite]]s.  The rights to purchase tickets for approximately ⅓ of the seats are being sold through lifetime [[personal seat license]]s, ranging from $2,500–$10,000 per seat.

[[File:GlaciariumPoster.jpg|thumb|An 1844 poster for the Glaciarium]]

The '''Glaciarium''' was the world's first mechanically frozen [[ice rink]].&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;Martin C. Harris, ''Homes of British Ice Hockey''&lt;/ref&gt; An item in the 8 June 1844 issue of Littell's Living Age headed "The Glaciarium" reports that "This establishment, which has been removed to Grafton street East' Tottenham-court-road [sic],was opened on Monday afternoon.  The area of artificial ice is extremely convenient for such as may be desirous of engaging in the graceful and manly pastime of skating".&lt;ref name="littell"&gt;Littell's Living Age, Volume 1, No. 4, p.&amp;nbsp;201&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Glaciarium Ice Rink.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Glaciarium in 1876]]
A later rink was opened by [[John Gamgee]] in a tent in a small building just off the [[Kings Road]] in [[Chelsea, London]], on 7 January 1876.  In March, it moved to a permanent venue at 379 Kings Road, where a rink measuring 40 by 24 feet was established.&lt;ref name="harris" /&gt;

The rink was based on a concrete surface, with layers of earth, cow hair and timber planks.  Atop these were laid oval [[copper]] pipes carrying a solution of [[glycerine]] with [[ether]], [[nitrogen peroxide]] and [[water]].  The pipes were covered by water and the solution was pumped through, freezing the water into [[ice]].  Gamgee had discovered the process while attempting to develop a method to freeze meat for import from [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], and had [[patented]] it as early as 1870.&lt;ref name="harris" /&gt;

Gamgee operated the rink on a membership-only basis and attempted to attract a wealthy clientele, experienced in open-air [[ice skating]] during winters in the [[Alps]].  He installed an [[orchestra]] gallery, which could also be used by spectators, and decorated the walls with views of the [[Swiss Alps]].&lt;ref name="harris" /&gt;

The rink initially proved a success, and Gamgee opened two further rinks later in the year: at [[Rusholme]] in [[Manchester]] and the "Floating Glaciarium" at [[Charing Cross]] in London, this last significantly larger at 115 by 25 feet.  However, the process was expensive, and [[mist]]s rising from the ice deterred customers, forcing Gamgee to close the Glaciarium by the end of the year, and all his rinks had shut by mid-1878.  However, the [[Southport Glaciarium]] opened in 1879, using Gamgee's method.&lt;ref name="harris" /&gt;

{{for|the nearby greyhound track also called Belle Vue|Belle Vue Stadium}}
'''Hyde Road Stadium''' often referred to as Belle Vue was the home of the [[Belle Vue Aces]] [[motorcycle speedway|speedway]] team. The stadium's` capacity was 40,000 and it was built in 1928 and used until demolished in 1987. It was claimed, incorrectly, to have been the first purpose built speedway track in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huggins |first1=Mike |last2=Williams |first2=Jack |title=Sport and the English, 1918-1939 |publisher=Routledge |page=67 |year=2005 |isbn=978-0415331845}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 [[File:BelleVueSpeedway.jpg|thumb|right|Belle Vue Aces in 1963]]

==History==
Part of the complex of buildings and attractions that formed [[Belle Vue Zoological Gardens]] the Hyde Road stadium was originally constructed in 1886 as an athletics ground. It was named after [[A57 road#Manchester–Sheffield|Hyde Road]], a road which begins at the east end of Ardwick Green South in [[Ardwick]] and runs east towards [[Hyde, Greater Manchester|Hyde]]. At the boundary between Gorton and [[Denton, Greater Manchester|Denton]] it continues as Manchester Road.&lt;ref&gt;''Geographia Manchester Colour Map''. London: Geographia, 1986 {{ISBN|0-09-218190-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928 the owners of the gardens decided to convert the stadium for use as a speedway venue. The opening speedway meeting here was staged on 23 March 1929, when Arthur Franklyn won the Golden Helmet. Following the announcement that Stuart Bamforth had sold the stadium for redevelopment, the last speedway meeting was staged on 1 November 1987, when a double header took place. Firstly, Belle Vue defeated the [[Coventry Bees]] in a replay of the League Cup before losing to the [[Cradley Heath Heathens]] in the final league match ever raced at Hyde Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bellevueaces.co/history_hyderd.aspx|title=History Hyde Road}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speedway returned to Belle Vue Greyhound stadium and remained there.

Some of the more famous riders who rode at Hyde Road, either for international meetings, as a Belle Vue Ace, or as a visiting team rider include [[Individual Speedway World Championship|Speedway World Champions]] [[Jack Young (speedway rider)|Jack Young]], [[Peter Craven]], [[Ronnie Moore (speedway rider)|Ronnie Moore]], [[Ove Fundin]], [[Barry Briggs]], [[Ivan Mauger]], [[Ole Olsen (speedway rider)|Ole Olsen]], [[Peter Collins (speedway rider)|Peter Collins]], [[Anders Michanek]], [[Egon Müller]], [[Michael Lee (speedway rider)|Michael Lee]], [[Bruce Penhall]], [[Erik Gundersen]], and [[Hans Nielsen (speedway rider)|Hans Nielsen]].

The speedway at Hyde Road was {{convert|382|m|yd|abbr=off}} in length.

The site of the old Hyde Road stadium is now the site of the [[British Car Auctions|British Car Auctions Ltd]].

==Speedway World Finals==
Hyde Road hosted the Final of the [[Speedway World Pairs Championship|World Pairs Championship]] in 1974 and 1977.
===World Pairs Championship===

The '''Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports''' is a branch of the [[Government of India]], which administers Department of youth affairs and Department of Sports in India. [[Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore]] is the current [[Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports (India)|Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports]], who is in the capacity of [[Minister of State]] (Independent Charge).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports |publisher= Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports | url = http://yas.nic.in| accessdate = 2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Portfolio of Modi government ministers: Vijay Goel appointed as the new Sports Minister |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/article/india-news/modi-cabinet-reshuffle-2016-vijay-goel-takes-oath-as-mos/307157 |work=[[The Financial Express (India)|The Financial Express]] |date=5 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ministry also gives the annual National Sports awards in various categories, including the [[Arjuna Award]] and [[Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna| Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 2013 Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna and Arjuna Awards|publisher= Press Information Bureau, Ministry of Youth Affairs &amp; Sports| url = http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=98548 |date=22 August 2013| accessdate = 2014-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Ministry was set up as the Department of Sports at the time of organisation of [[1982 Asian Games]] New Delhi. Its name was changed to the Department of Youth Affairs &amp; Sports during celebration of the [[International Youth Year]], 1985. It became a separate Ministry on 27 May 2000. Subsequently, In 2008, the Ministry has been bifurcated into Department of Youth Affairs and Department of Sports under two separate [[Departmental secretary|Secretaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Introduction |publisher= Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports | url = http://yas.nic.in/en/yas2/introduction | accessdate = 2014-08-13  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Department of Youth Affairs==
Unlike the sports department, many of the functions of the department are related to other ministries, like  Ministry of Education, Employment &amp; Training, Health and Family Welfare thus it functions largely as a facilitator for youth building.

It gives two awards, Tenzing Norgay National Adventure Award and Indira Gandhi NSS Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Awards | publisher=Department of Youth Affairs| url = http://yas.nic.in/en/yas1/awards | accessdate = 2014-08-13  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition of Youth===
The [[United Nations]] defines "Youth" as 15–24 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Youth |publisher=UNESCO| url = http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/youth/ | accessdate = 2014-08-13  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Commonwealth, it is 15–29 years. In order to use a definition more in line with these international standards, the Draft NYP 2012 changes the definition from 13–35 years to 16–30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Draft National Youth Policy 2012 seeks a shift in youth age bracket|publisher= Indian Express| url = http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/draft-national-youth-policy-2012-seeks-a-shift-in-youth-age-bracket/1073409/0 |author=Prasad Joshi|date= 13 February 2013 |accessdate = 2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The draft NYP 2012 plans to divide the age bracket of 16–30 years into three groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Draft policy redefines 16-30 age group as youth

'''Party games''' are [[game]]s that are played at social gatherings to facilitate [[interaction]] and provide [[entertainment]] and [[recreation]]. Categories include (explicit) [[icebreaker (facilitation)|icebreaker]], [[Parlour game|parlour]] (indoor), picnic (outdoor), and large group games.&lt;ref name="Adults"&gt;Frankel, Lillian; Frankel, Godfrey; and Anderson, Doug (2007). ''Party Games for Adults'', p.7. Sterling. {{ISBN|9781402746864}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;Sheila Anne Barry (1987). ''The World's Best Party Games'', p.3. Sterling. {{ISBN|9780806964843}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other types include pairing off (partnered) games, and parlour races.&lt;ref name="Barry"/&gt; Different games will generate different atmospheres so the party game may merely be intended as an icebreakers, or the sole purpose for or structure of the party. As such, party games aim to include players of various skill levels and player-elimination is rare.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Ben (2009). "Fort Ancient: Ohio", ''Proceedings of the 3rd European Conference on Game Based Learning'', p.259. Academic Conferences. {{ISBN|9781906638474}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Party games are intended to be played socially, and are designed to be easy for new players to learn.&lt;ref&gt;McGonigal, Jane (2011). ''Reality Is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World'', unpaginated. Penguin. {{ISBN|9781101475492}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The characteristics of party games tend to include:
* A game can support a relatively large or undefined number of players, compared to more traditional [[board game]]s or [[card game]]s that require a small, set number of players. Some games, especially commercial games, have a set limit based on available equipment; others are limited by other mechanics of the game like time for each turn, while still others have no practical limit.
* Team-based play in party games is common, but not required. Games that divide players into two, three, or four roughly equal teams, such as ''[[Cranium (game)|Cranium]]'', [[Charades]] or ''[[Pictionary]]'' tend to allow for larger total numbers of players. By contrast, other games such as [[Mafia (party game)|Werewolf]] and ''[[How to Host a Murder]]'' are role-based, with each player being given a character or other role to play in the course of the game. The number of players is limited to the number of roles, but in many such games there are "generic" roles allowing for a high degree of flexibility.
* Cooperation and interaction between players is encouraged. Both team and role-based play generally encourage this social aspect to the game; games that do not encourage this interaction generally make poor party games.
* Multiple ways to play and contribute. For example, in ''[[Fictionary]]'' not everyone needs to create plausible dictionary definitions; humorous submissions are welcome. In Charades, players can actively participate in guessing without taking a turn at acting. Sports often make poor party games as limitations in a player's physical abilities may preclude participation though some party games, such as: relay racing and [[Red light/Green light]], involve a significant physical aspect and are especially suitable for groups similar in age and ability.
* Players participate in gameplay frequently, sometimes on an impromptu basis. Games in which each player has their own independent turn generally make poor party games, especially if a turn takes a long time.
* A game should also have entertainment value for spectators. Many party games involve at least some level of humor, whether inherent in the game or introduced by players. In this way, players not taking a turn can still enjoy the gameplay, whilst [[party favors]] can embellish the party atmosphere.
* Player elimination is rare. ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' makes a poor party game, because bankrupt players must sit out while the remaining players continue to the game's conclusion, which can take several hours. In contrast, no matter how far behind a team is in ''[[Pictionary]]'', all players can participate until the end.
* The amount of specialized equipment needed is not dependent on the number of players. Games such as [[Liar's Dice]] make poor party games because each player needs a cup and five dice to start the game. By contrast, ''[[Yahtzee]]'' needs only one cup and set of dice regardless of the number of players (the basic Yahtzee game does have other practical limitations).
* The game usually does not involve spending real money as a prerequisite or consequence of playing. Games that require each player to purchase consumable items or specialized equipment are usually poor party games. Casino games are a notable exception. Examples include "casino nights" with a token door charge or buy-in for charity or to defray costs and poker tournaments with a similar small buy-in.

==Video games==
{{See also|List of party video games}}
{{Expand section|date=June 2018}}
''[[BYTE]]'' in 1981 called ''[[Olympic Decathlon]]'' (1980) "the first true party game for microcomputers".&lt;ref name="williams198112"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-12/1981_12_BYTE_06-12_Computer_Games#page/n7/mode/2up | title=New Games New Directions | work=BYTE | date=December 1981 | accessdate=19 October 2016 | author=Williams, Gregg | pages=6–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early example is [[Starpath]]'s ''[[Party Mix (video game)|Party Mix]]''. Party video games are commonly designed as a collection of simple minigames, designed to be intuitive and easy to control, and allow for competition between a large number of players. Some of the games (most notably the ''Mario Party'' series) are played out on boardgame boards.

==Large group games==

Large group games are played by a large number of participants and are often used as planned activities in structured environments, especially as educational activities. They are similar to party games, except that large group games are typically planned for larger numbers (perhaps even hundreds) as part of an event.

Large group games can take a variety of forms and formats.

Some are physical games such as [[Buck buck]].

Some are modeled on the TV [[game show]] format, offering points for teams who can answer questions the fastest. Trivia-type games might have questions posed from the stage and each tabletop writing their answers to be collected and scored. Others may take on some of the qualities of Open Space environments and allow participants to wander in a less structured way.

Some are modeled on TV reality shows such as [[The Amazing Race]] or [[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]].  Participants compete as individuals or in teams to complete challenges that move them towards victory in a competition spanning the entire party.  The TV shows on which such parties are based are normally competitions involving elimination, so such events require significant planning to avoid exclusion or boredom.

Group [[board games]] can take on the design of small groups of players, seated at tables of 4 to 6 people, who work together on a problem. There can be large numbers of people (and thus many tables). If properly designed, these scalable exercises can be used for small groups (12 to 20 people) as well as very large events (600 people or 100 tables).

Generally, for these larger exercises, [[multimedia]] projectors, large screens and microphones are required for instructions and communications.

A search for team building events can turn up millions of links to exercises, companies, and all kinds of offerings ranging from paintball competitions to fire walks to outdoor climbing or whitewater adventures. The impact on actual team building can vary widely - a golf outing for corporate executives does not generally accomplish much in the way of organizational improvement while a business simulation might be directly focused on linking the play of the game to issues for corporate improvement.

Holiday groups use a gift exchange party game such as [[white elephant gift exchange]] for socializing and sharing gifts. New online party games, based on these holiday games, allow larger groups to gather on the internet to save travel expenses.

[[Image:Paulporterarena.JPG|thumb| 300px|Women's Basketball Game in Paul Porter Arena]]
'''Paul Porter Arena''' is a 3,500-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Boiling Springs, North Carolina]]. It is home to the [[Gardner-Webb University]] Runnin' Bulldogs, of the Big South Conference. The Arena was named in honor of Paul B. Porter who was a Board of Advisors Honorary Member and Lifetime Member. The arena is part of the Lutz Yelton Convocation Center (LYCC) a project that was completed in 1982 which houses the Dover Theater and Paul Porter Arena. Although primarily used for [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]] athletic events, the arena is also used for graduation ceremonies, orientation and the weekly dimensions program. The [[seating plan]] in the arena can also be altered, as all of the red seats can be folded and pushed back allowing for greater floor space. Additional floor seating can also be added for events such as graduation or orientation.

The '''[[Philippines]]''' competed at the '''[[1956 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. 39 competitors, 35 men and 4 women, took part in 30 events in 7 sports.&lt;ref name="sports-reference"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/PHI/summer/1956/ |title=Philippines at the 1956 Melbourne Summer Games |accessdate=8 June 2015 |work=sports-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A resolution was filed at the [[Philippine Congress]] which seeks for a Philippine boycott of the 1956 Summer Olympics as a protest against the [[White Australia policy]] which targeted [[Asian Australians|immigrants with an Asian background]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Philippines asked to ban 'White Australia's' Olympics|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9FczAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-U0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6810%2C2420219|accessdate=15 September 2016|agency=Associated Press|publisher=The Deseret News|date=10 May 1949|location=Manila}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country nevertheless participated at the Games.

The Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation (PAAF) named the 39 athletes and four coaches in a special luncheon meeting at the Philippine Columbian Clubhouse. Antonio de las Alas, PAAF President, heads the Philippine delegation to [[Melbourne]].

The '''Shropshire Senior Cup''' is a county cup [[football (soccer)|football]] competition that is open for professional and non-professional senior football teams in the [[England|English]] county of [[Shropshire]].

The competition is one of the oldest cup competitions in the world, and notably, the original winning trophy is still presented to the winners, some 130 years after the Cup's inception. It is organised by the [[Shropshire Football Association]] and is annual.

The competition was first staged in the [[1877-78 in English football|1877–78]] season, the inaugural winners being Shrewsbury F.C, who beat Wellington Parish Church Institute 1–0. (Shrewsbury F.C are not connected to the current [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]], and dissolved late in 1879.)

Over the years, the competition has been dominated by the county's two leading football teams, Shrewsbury Town and [[Telford United F.C.|Telford United]], and more recently [[A.F.C. Telford United]] following the demise of the old Telford United in 2004.

Other county teams to have featured in the cup in recent years have included [[Market Drayton Town F.C.|Market Drayton Town]], [[Shifnal Town F.C.|Shifnal Town]], [[Bridgnorth Town F.C.|Bridgnorth Town]], [[Ludlow Town F.C.|Ludlow Town]] and [[The New Saints F.C.|The New Saints]].

[[File:Sick's Stadium, 1965.jpg|thumb|200px|Sick's Stadium in 1965]]
'''Sick's Stadium''', also known as '''Sick's Seattle Stadium''' and later as '''Sicks' Stadium''', was a [[baseball]] [[stadium]] in the [[Pacific Northwest|northwest]] [[United States]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. It was located in [[Rainier Valley, Seattle|Rainier Valley]], on the NE corner of S. McClellan Street and Rainier Avenue S. The longtime home of the [[Seattle Rainiers]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]], it hosted the [[Seattle Pilots]] during their only [[Major League Baseball|major league]] season in [[1969 Seattle Pilots season|1969]].

The site was previously the location of [[Dugdale Field]], a 1913 ballpark that was the home of the Rainiers' forerunners, the Seattle Indians. That park burned down in an Independence Day arson fire in 1932, and until a new stadium could be built on the Dugdale site, the team played at Civic Field, a converted football stadium at the current location of [[Seattle Center]]'s [[Memorial Stadium (Seattle)|Memorial Stadium]].

Sick's Stadium first opened in 1938 on June 15 as the home field of the [[Seattle Rainiers]] (the renamed Seattle Indians) of the [[Pacific Coast League]] (PCL).&lt;ref name=pspoil/&gt;&lt;ref name=bdrprnr/&gt; It was named after [[Emil Sick]], owner of the team and of the [[Rainier Brewing Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Frank|title=A Universal Pastime Meets the National Pastime|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/a-universal-pastime-meets-the-national-pastime/|website=Hardball Times|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rainiers played at the stadium through 1964, after which they were renamed the Seattle Angels, but continued to play at Sick's through 1968. In 1946, the stadium was briefly the home of the [[Seattle Steelheads]] of the short-lived [[West Coast Baseball Association]] [[Negro league baseball|Negro League]], who played at the stadium while the Rainiers were on the road.

After Emil Sick died in 1964, and various members of his family shared ownership, the name of the park was changed to reflect that fact, from the singular possessive form "Sick's Stadium" to the plural possessive form "Sicks' Stadium".

The city bought the stadium in 1965, in anticipation that part of the property was needed for a proposed freeway.&lt;ref name=stbbs&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yeBYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=q_cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6623,2797614|newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=(Washington)|agency=Associated Press |title=Seattle to buy ball stadium |date=August 12, 1965 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sgoosfs&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uPBLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4-0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4669,3157106|newspaper=Spokesman-Review|location=Spokane, Washington)|agency=Associated Press |title=Good ol' Sicks' for sale &amp;ndash; works |date=May 23, 1978 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field alignment was southeast, home plate to center field, which results in difficult visibility conditions for the left side of the defense in the early evening hours. The recommended alignment is east-northeast. 

===Seattle Pilots===
On April 11, 1969, [[Major League Baseball]] came to Seattle with the [[American League]] expansion Seattle Pilots debuting at Sick's Stadium. Seattle had been mentioned several times as a prospective major league city.  The [[Cleveland Indians]] almost moved there in the early 1960s, but owner [[William R. Daley|William Daley]] decided against it because he did not think that Sick's Stadium was suitable for a major league team.  [[Charlie Finley]] considered moving the [[Kansas City Athletics]] to Seattle in 1967, but when he came to scout out Sick's Stadium, he quipped that it was aptly named.  He advised Seattle officials to get a new stadium if it wanted a major league team.  When the American League granted the franchise in October 1967,&lt;ref name=spalc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VLBhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yugDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7101%2C822305 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Seattle promised American League club; Athletics moved from KC to Oakland |date=October 19, 1967 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smlsial&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XFdYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uPcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6944%2C1337114|work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Seattle may land spot in AL|date=October 19, 1967 |page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; it explicitly stated that Sick's Stadium was not suitable as a major league facility, and was only to be used on a temporary basis until a domed stadium could be completed.&lt;ref name=sokbpc &gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0m1OAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4ksDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5974,4418905 |newspaper=Ellensburg Daily Record |location=(Washington)|agency=Associated Press |title=Seattle OK's ballpark construction at Sicks |date=September 24, 1968 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It soon became obvious why Daley (who bought a stake in the Pilots) and Finley were wary about Sick's.  The franchise agreement required the Pilots to expand Sick's Stadium to 30,000 seats by the start of the 1969 season. However, due to cost overruns, poor weather and other delays, only 17,000 seats were ready by opening day.  Several of the 17,150 people who showed up had to wait three innings to take their seats because workers were still putting them together by the time of the first pitch.  In the Pilots' defense, original plans called for them to begin play in 1971.  However, the date was moved up two years when [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Stuart Symington]] of [[Missouri]] demanded that the Pilots' expansion brethren, the [[Kansas City Royals]], be ready for play in [[1969 Major League Baseball season|1969]].  Professional baseball had been played in Kansas City in one form or another from {{baseball year|1883}} until the A's left for [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] after the [[1967 Kansas City Athletics season|1967]] season, and Symington would not accept the prospect of Kansas City having to wait three years for baseball to return.&lt;ref name=smlsial/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Seattle Times'', 19 October 1967&lt;/ref&gt; This forced Seattle to start play in 1969 as well in order to balance the schedule.

The stadium expanded to 25,000 seats by June, but many of those seats had obstructed views.  There were no field-level camera pits, so photographers had to set up their equipment atop the grandstand roof.  The clubhouse facilities were second-class.  Also, no upgrades were made to the stadium's piping, resulting in almost nonexistent water pressure after the seventh inning, especially when crowds exceeded 10,000.  This forced players to shower in their hotel rooms or at home after the game.  The visiting team's announcers couldn't see any plays along [[third baseman|third base]] or [[left fielder|left field]].  The Pilots had to place a mirror in the press box, and the visiting announcers had to look into it and "refract" plays in those areas.  By the middle of the season, it was obvious that Sick's Stadium was completely inadequate even for temporary use.

Under the circumstances, only 678,000 fans came to see the Pilots, 20th out of 24 teams&lt;ref name=brf69at&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/1969-misc.shtml|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|title=1969 Major League Baseball Attendance &amp; Miscellaneous |accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; — a major reason why the team was forced into bankruptcy after only one season.&lt;ref name=fssoscm&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ru9OAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vgEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7258,1156659 |newspaper=Toledp Blade |agency=Associated Press |title=Financially stricken Seattle owners still courting move|date=March 1970|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the poor stadium conditions, the ticket prices were among the highest in the major leagues.&lt;ref name=ssdhru&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LVgaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OCgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2841,222693|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |title=Seattle Story: Downhill Run |date=April 1, 1970 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team was sold out of bankruptcy court to a [[Milwaukee]]-based group on March 31,&lt;ref name=wblaco&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LVgaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OCgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6687%2C12506|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal|title=We're Big League Again!

==Concerts and other events==
Though Sick's Stadium was primarily a baseball venue, it also occasionally held other events, including rock concerts &amp;mdash; most famously, an [[Elvis Presley]] concert on September 1, 1957 (one of the first concerts to be held at a major outdoor stadium), which was attended by a young [[Jimi Hendrix]].&lt;ref name=tdepss&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/thebigblog/2010/12/03/p-i-archive-the-day-elvis-presley-stormed-seattle/ |publisher=Seattle PI.com|title=P-I archive: The day Elvis Presley stormed Seattle |accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sunday night concert followed an afternoon ball game during the Labor Day weekend.&lt;ref name=psbwsa&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7KFaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=g08DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2974,4653842|newspaper=Prescott Evening Courier |location=(Arizona)|agency=Associated Press |title=Presley shares billing with Seattle, Angels |date=September 2, 1957|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hendrix himself later performed at the stadium in the rain on July 26, 1970, as did [[Janis Joplin]], just months before their respective deaths.&lt;ref name=hxlsfl&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sepWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=le0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7105,2387775|newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington)|last=Carson |first=Jerry |title=Hendrix' life said full |agency=Associated Press, ''(Seattle Times)'' |date=September 22, 1970 |page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In boxing, [[Floyd Patterson]] knocked out Olympic gold medalist [[Pete Rademacher]] in six rounds on August 22, 1957.&lt;ref name=pppaois&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=h9VYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=P-cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6055%2C6582595|newspaper=Spokesman-Review|location=(Spokane, Washington)|last=Boni |first=Bill |title=Patterson pounds Pete; all over in 6th round|date=August 23, 1957|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future heavyweight champion [[Sonny Liston]] defeated Portland's [[Eddie Machen]] in a 12-round decision at Sick's on September 7, 1960.&lt;ref name=celdem&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UVspAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=g-cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2285%2C2243744|newspaper=Spokesman-Review|location=(Spokane, Washington)|agency=Associated Press|title=Cold-eyed Liston decisions Eddie Machen in Seattle go|date=September 8, 1960|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the Pilots==
[[File:Sick's Stadium Sign.jpg|thumb|200px|Sign outside [[Lowe's]] store in 2009, marking the site of Sick's Stadium]]
From 1972 to 1976, a new [[Seattle Rainiers]] team, in the short-season Class A [[Northwest League]], played at Sicks' to sparse audiences.&lt;ref name=nqts&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8cdeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QjIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6458,3703368 |newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho)|last=Manders |first=Jim |title=Not quite the same |date=August 18, 1972 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major leagues returned in [[1977 Seattle Mariners season|1977]] with the expansion [[Seattle Mariners]] at the new [[Kingdome]] (originally approved by area voters as a condition of getting the Pilots).

The [[Washington Huskies baseball]] team used the venue during the 1973 season while their on-campus venue, [[Husky Ballpark#Graves Field|Graves Field]], was renovated.&lt;ref name=sicks&gt;{{cite news|title=Huskies to use Sicks' Stadium|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=G6hYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rfgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3427%2C3856290 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=(Washington)|date=April 12, 1973 |agency=Associated Press|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name=huskiesuse&gt;{{cite news|title=Huskies to Use Sicks' Stadium|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=G6hYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rfgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3339,4107691&amp;dq=graves-field+huskies&amp;hl=en|accessdate=16 August 2012|newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle|location=(Washington)|date=12 April 1973|agency=The Associated Press|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

The stadium site is currently marked by a sign (on the corner of Rainier and McClellan) and a replica of home plate (near the store's exit) as well as markings inside the store where the bases were. Sixty feet and six inches (18.44 m) from home plate, near the cash registers, is a circle where the mound and pitching rubber were. The store has a glass display case containing mementos of the Pilots, Rainiers, and Angels.

Most of the primary assets of Sick's were bought for $60,000 in 1978 by [[Harry Ornest]], the owner of the new [[Sacramento River Cats|Vancouver Canadians]] for use at [[Scotiabank Field at Nat Bailey Stadium|Nat Bailey Stadium]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name=sgoosfs/&gt; Another purchaser was [[Washington State Cougars baseball|Washington State University]] in [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]], which bought bleachers, fencing, and the foul poles in 1979 to construct the new [[Bailey–Brayton Field|Buck Bailey Field]].&lt;ref name=Lowry&gt;{{cite book |title=Green Cathedrals |last=Lowry |first=Philip |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=Walker &amp; Company |location= |isbn=978-0-8027-1608-8 |page=217 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Afo5vtVTz4wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=green%20cathedrals&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bofrhttleg&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gfZLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ce4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5755,3484121|newspaper=Spokesman-Review|location=(Spokane, Washington)|last=Goodwin |first=Dale |title=Bobo: From 'hitcher' to legend |date=April 22, 1979|page=C6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bleachers didn't fit well and were later sold.&lt;ref name=atrtls&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-fQzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=L_IDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3080%2C1074132 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review|location=(Spokane, Washington)|last=Blanchette |first=John |title=All the right tools |date=January 23, 2000|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Slacklining''' refers to the act of walking or [[balance (ability)|balancing]] along a suspended length of flat [[webbing]] that is [[tension (physics)|tensioned]] between two [[anchor (climbing)|anchors]]. Slacklining is similar to slack rope walking and [[tightrope walking]]. Slacklines differ from tightwires and tightropes in the type of material used and the amount of tension applied during use. Slacklines are tensioned significantly less than tightropes or tightwires in order to create a dynamic line which will stretch and bounce like a long and narrow [[trampoline]]. Tension can be adjusted to suit the user, and different webbing may be used in various circumstances. Slacklining is popular because of its simplicity and versatility; it can be used in various environments with few components.

==Styles of slacklining==
[[File:1B GASP slackline 11.jpg|upright|thumb|Slacklining on a beach]]

==={{Anchor|Urbanlining}}Urbanlining===
Urbanlining or urban slacklining combines all the different styles of slacklining. It is practiced in urban areas, for example in city parks and on the streets. Most urban slackliners prefer wide {{Convert|2|in|cm|0|adj = on}} lines for tricklining on the streets, but some may use narrow ({{Convert|5/8|or|1|in|cm|disp = comma}}) lines for longline purposes or for waterlining. Also see the other sections of slackline styles below.

One type of urbanlining is timelining, where one tries to stay on a slackline for as long as possible without falling down. This takes tremendous concentration and focus of will, and is a great endurance training for postural muscles.

[[File:Slackline handstand.jpg|thumb|Slackline handstand]]

Another type of urbanlining is streetlining, which combines street workout power moves with the slackline's dynamic, shaky, bouncy feeling. Main focus are static handstands, super splits&amp;nbsp;— hands and feet together, planche, front lever, back lever, one arm handstand and other interesting extreme moves that are evolving in street workout culture.

===Tricklining===
Tricklining has become the most common form of slacklining because of the easy setup of {{Convert|2|in|cm|0|adj = on}} slackline kits. Tricklining is often done low to the ground but can be done on highlines as well. A great number of tricks can be done on the line, and because the sport is fairly new, there is plenty of room for new tricks. Some of the basic tricks done today are walking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wikihow.com/Walk-a-Slackline |title=How To Walk a Slackline|publisher=Wikihow}}&lt;/ref&gt; walking backwards, turns, drop knee, running and jumping onto the slackline to start walking, and bounce walking. Some intermediate tricks include: Buddha sit, sitting down, lying down, cross-legged knee drop, surfing forward, surfing sideways, and jump turns, or "180s." Some of the advanced tricks are: jumps,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wikihow.com/Slackline:-Jump-Line-To-Line |title=How to Slackline: Jump Line-to-Line|publisher=Wikihow}}&lt;/ref&gt; tree plants, jumping from line-to-line, 360s, butt bounces, and chest bounces. With advancements in webbing technology &amp; tensioning systems, the limits for what can be done on a slackline are being pushed constantly. It is not uncommon to see expert slackliners incorporating flips and twists into slackline trick combinations.

===Highlining===
[[File:Man highlining in Yosemite National Park with El Capitan in the background.JPG|thumb|Man highlining at Taft Point in Yosemite National Park with El Capitan in the background.]]
Highlining is slacklining at elevation above the ground or water. Many slackliners consider highlining to be the pinnacle of the sport. Highlines are commonly set up in locations that have been used or are still used for [[Tyrolean traverse]]. When rigging highlines, experienced slackers take measures to ensure that solid, redundant and equalized anchors are used to secure the line into position. Modern highline rigging typically entails a mainline of webbing, backup webbing, and either climbing rope or amsteel rope for redundancy. However, many highlines are rigged with a mainline and backup only, especially if the highline is low tension (less than {{Convert|900|lbf|kgf N|abbr = on}}), or rigged with high quality webbing like [https://web.archive.org/web/20130426093643/http://www.balancecommunity.com/Type-18-MKII Type 18] or [https://web.archive.org/web/20130518091412/http://www.balancecommunity.com/Spider-Silk-MKII MKII Spider Silk]. It is also common to pad all areas of the rigging which might come in contact with abrasive surfaces. To ensure safety, most highliners wear a climbing harness or [[glossary of climbing terms|swami belt]] with a leash attached to the slackline itself. Leash-less, or "free-solo" slacklining&amp;nbsp;– a term borrowed from rockclimbing&amp;nbsp;– is not unheard of, however, with proponents such as [[Dean Potter]] and [[Andy Lewis (performer)|Andy Lewis]].&lt;ref name="canyon"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17811115 | work=BBC News | title=US slackline walker Dean Potter crosses China canyon | date=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slackline yoga===
Slackline yoga takes traditional [[Yoga as exercise or alternative medicine|yoga]] poses and moves them to the slackline. It has been described{{by whom|date=March 2017}} as "distilling the art of yogic concentration".  To balance on a {{Convert|1|in|cm|adj = on}} piece of webbing lightly tensioned between two trees is not easy{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}, and doing yoga poses on it is even more challenging. The practice simultaneously develops focus, dynamic balance, power, breath, core integration, flexibility, and confidence. Using standing postures, sitting postures, arm balances, kneeling postures, inversions and unique [[vinyasa]], a skilled slackline yogi is able to create a flowing yoga practice without ever falling from the line.

Slackline yoga has been covered in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=5 April 2008|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120735228186491329 |title=Into the Wild With Yoga|first=Alexandra|last=Alter|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=8 November 2012|quote=Jason Magness meditates in full-lotus posture balanced on a slackline over the Arizona desert..

Highlights included Greg Kalfa's ballsy backflip attempt and Josh Beau, looking as at home on the webbing as anyone else did on the ground (especially during his side-plank and other yoga-inspired moves).|work=[[Climbing.com]]|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freestyle slacklining===
Freestyle slacklining (a.k.a. “rodeo slacklining") is the art and practice of cultivating balance on a piece of rope or webbing draped slack between two anchor points, typically about {{Convert|15|to|30|ft|cm|round=5}} apart and {{Convert|2|to|3|ft|cm|round = 5}} off the ground in the center. This type of very "slack" slackline provides a wide array of opportunities for both swinging and static maneuvers. A freestyle slackline has no tension in it, while both traditional slacklines and tightropes are tensioned. This slackness in the rope or webbing allows it to swing at large amplitudes and adds a different dynamic. This form of slacklining first came into popularity in 1999, through a group of students from [[Colby College]] in [[Waterville, Maine]]. It was first written about on a website called the "Vultures Peak Center for Freestyle and Rodeo Slackline Research" in 2004. The article "Old Revolution&amp;nbsp;— New Recognition - 3-10-04" describes these early developments in detail.

Windlining is a practice of slacklining performed in very windy conditions.  Depending on the intensity of the wind, it can be difficult to remain on the line without being blown off.  The sensation one experiences is like flying as the slacker must angle his body and arms in an aerodynamic manner to maintain balance.

==History==
While rope walking has been around in one manner or another for thousands of years, the origins of modern-day slacklining is generally attributed to a young rock climber named Adam Grosowsky from southern [[Illinois]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;"Above the Lawn, Walking the Line". New York Times; Sept. 8, 2006 https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/travel/escapes/08slack.html&lt;/ref&gt; A then sixteen-year-old Adam, the son of the head of [[Southern Illinois University]]'s Design Department, became obsessed with a photo he found in the university library with the understated caption "Circus Performers c1890"; the photo depicted a wire bolted low on a wall on one end and the other terminating in a wristloop held by a performer doing a one-hand handstand on the top of a flagpole with his body canted far to the opposite side counterbalancing the weight of the wire. In the middle of that wire was another performer in a handstand. Adam successfully harassed the small band of local climbers into almost believing they could reproduce this feat. They all set about learning to walk on climbing ropes, webbing, chains and low / high wires, but only Adam managed to carry through with achieving some elements of that historic circus feat, most notably being able to maintain an indefinite handstand on {{Convert|1|in|cm|adj = on}} webbing and even getting it rocking side-to-side while in the handstand. Adam carried those bad habits to [[Olympia, Washington]]'s [[The Evergreen State College]] in 1979,&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; where he met fellow climbers Jeff Ellington and Brooke Sandahl. Adam set up his permanent heavy highwire in the woods on campus while the trio continued to perfect walking, handstands, and jump mounts on webbing. Their handstand work focused on {{Convert|1|in|cm|adj = on}} flat climbing webbing and they also employed the dynamics and flexibility of the nylon webbing to develop all manner of other tricks, including a three-club passing (juggling) routine between two slackliners balanced simultaneously on the same line. Red Square, Evergreen's central campus plaza, was a convenient between-class practice area where they often drew crowds of spectators. Grosowsky, along with Ellington were fascinated with wirewalking history and circus culture from the start, and in 1981 performed leashless on a {{Convert|30|ft|4 = 0|adj = on}} highline strung {{Convert|25|ft|4 = 0}} over a concrete floor as part of a project to recreate a traditional one-ring circus in The Evergreen State College's main performance auditorium. During this period Grosowsky, who is now a regionally well-known Northwest artist, devoted much of his lithographic art to themes involving wirewalking and [[circus]] culture. The sport blossomed within the West Coast [[rock climbing]] community, and then spread to other areas. It got attention during the 2016 Rio Olympics when slackliner [[Giovanna Petrucci]] performed on the beach at [[Ipanema]], attracting the attention of the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="twsNYT1"&gt;{{cite web

A professional slackliner was credited with climbing a ski lift tower in Colorado and shimmying across a cable to save a man caught by a ski lift in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seattletimes.com/life/outdoors/man-dangling-by-neck-from-ski-lift-saved-by-professional-slackliner/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Highlining history===
Highlining was inspired by a number of [[tightrope walking|highwire]] artists who walked steel cable up high in unique places. From 1907-1948, Mr. Ivy Baldwind of [[Eldorado Springs, Colorado]] crossed [[Eldorado Canyon (Colorado)|Eldorado Canyon]] on a high wire numerous times. His final crossing was documented on his 82nd birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph M. Olson and the Carnegie Branch of the Boulder Public Library. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJLBvBIoJ88&lt;/ref&gt; On August 7, 1974 Philippe Petit set-up and crossed a high wire between the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In the summer of 1983, Adam Grosowsky and Jeff Ellington set up a {{convert|55|ft|m|sing=on}} high wire at [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]]'s [[Lost Arrow Spire]] that was nearly {{convert|2890|ft|m}} high. However, neither of them were able to completely cross this line because of inadequate guying. In the autumn of 1983, inspired by Jeff and Adam's efforts, a 20-year-old Scott Balcom and 17-year-old Chris Carpenter successfully completed what is believed to be the first documented high walk on nylon webbing,&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;Alpinist, Issue 21, Autumn 2007, "The Space Between, a history of funambulism" by Dean Potter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Walk the Line&amp;nbsp;— the art of balance and the craft of slackline'', by Scott Balcom 2005 {{ISBN|0-9764850-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of using cable, giving birth to what slackliners now call highlining. This first highline, referred to as The Arches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Arches&amp;nbsp;– 1983|publisher=rockclimbing.com|url=http://www.rockclimbing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a span about {{Convert|30|ft|4 = 0}} long and about {{Convert|120|ft|round = 5}} above ground in [[Pasadena, California]] under the [[Ventura Freeway|California SR 134 Freeway]] bridge, between two arches that spanned the trickling Arroyo Seco below. The next summer (1984), Scott Balcom set up a highline on Yosemite’s Lost Arrow Spire with the help of Darrin Carter and Chris Carpenter. Scott’s attempt, however, was unsuccessful (neither Darrin nor Chris made an attempt). On July 13, 1985, Scott Balcom returned and successfully crossed the now-famous Lost Arrow Spire highline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6RYJFz1tqI |title=First Slackline Crossing of the Lost Arrow Spire|publisher=YouTube|date=24 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1990, Chris Carpenter purposefully "surfed" a highline spanning the gap of [[Horsetooth Rock]] in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]]. In 1993, Darrin Carter became the second person to successfully cross the Lost Arrow Spire highline.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.landcruising-slacklines.de/en/knowledge/history |title=The History of Slacklining |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719054121/http://www.landcruising-slacklines.de/en/knowledge/history |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slackline.com/?page_id=20 |title=History of Slacklining|publisher=slackline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Darrin Carter performed unprotected crossings of the Lost Arrow Spire in Yosemite and The Fins, in Tucson, AZ on Mt.

===Longest free solo highline===
The longest free solo highline was walked in Hunlen Falls, in Northern British Columbia August, 2016. At a length of 72m and 400m high, it was walked by Friedi Kühne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Leftcoast|title=New Free Solo Highline World Record by Friedi Kühne {{!}} shot in 4k|date=2016-09-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEH87tg70zA|accessdate=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longest free solo highline by a female is held by Faith Dickey, who walked a 28-meter-long highline in [[Ostrov (Karlovy Vary District)|Ostrov]], [[Czech Republic]] in August 2012. The line was 25 meters high.

===Highest slackline===
The highest slackline on record was walked by Christian Schou on August 3, 2006 at [[Kjerag]] in [[Rogaland]], [[Norway]]. The slackline was {{convert|1000|m|ft|0}} high. The project was repeated by Aleksander Mork in September 2007. &lt;ref&gt;{{http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/74401-highest-slackline-walk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current record for walking the highest and longest urban highline is held by professional slackliner Alexander Schulz of [[Germany]], who walked a slackline at a height of {{Convert|807|ft}} on December 4, 2016 between the [[Torre BBVA Bancomer]] and [[Torre Reforma]] in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]. Alexander Schulz walked successfully the {{convert|712|ft}} long slackline that was stretched over the wide avenue [[Paseo de la Reforma]].&lt;ref&gt;https://uk.news.yahoo.com/barefoot-walker-breaks-world-record-in-nail-biting-high-line-stroll-105707746.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/video/slackline-alexander-schulz-mit-weltrekord-in-mexiko-stadt-video-1726357.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nortedigital.mx/alexander-schulz-atraviesa-reforma-mas-200-metros/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ratchetstraps.com/slackline&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longest slackline (longline)===
The longest slackline, with a length of {{convert|610|m|ft}}, was walked on May 9, 2015 by Alexander Schulz in [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daredevil breaks world slackline record with 610m walk in Mongolian desert|last=Fullerton|first=Jamie|publisher=Daily Mail|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3081616/Daredevil-breaks-world-slackline-record-610m-walk-Mongolian-desert-days-risking-wrath-Chinese-performing-stunt-Great-Wall.html|date=2015-05-14|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1025">{{about|the element of a track||Straight (disambiguation)}}
In many forms of [[racing]], the '''straight''' is those parts of the [[race track]] in which the competitors travel in a straight line for any significant time, as opposed to a bend. The term is used in [[horse racing]], [[motor racing]] and [[track and field athletics]].

In athletics, a typical 400 m track features two straights and two bends. The final straight before the [[Finish line (disambiguation)|finish line]] is known as the '''home straight''', or the '''pit straight''' in [[Formula One]], while the other is known as the '''back straight'''.

In motor racing, both the [[pit lane]] and finish line are often located on the longest straight on the circuit. A notable exception is the 6&amp;nbsp;km [[Mulsanne Straight]] at Le Mans, which is at the opposite side of the circuit.

In the United States the home straight in athletics, and also the straight part of a motor racing track, is sometimes referred to as a ''straightaway''.

'''The Varsity Polo Match''' is an annual polo match between the [[Oxford University Polo Club]] and the Cambridge University Polo Club, played between teams of four players. Historically it was known as the ''inter-University Challenge Cup'' or ''inter-Varsity polo match''.&lt;ref&gt;Sporting Notes. In: Nottingham Evening Post, Tuesday 27 June 1905&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Times. 12 June 1965, ''Woolmers Park'' p.1&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as the Oxford-Cambridge Polo Match or by a title that includes the name of its current sponsor (1982 Champagne Taittinger University matches; 1984 Krug Champagne Varsity Polo&lt;ref&gt;Horse and Hound, June 18 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;; from 2010 to 2014, the Jack Wills Varsity Polo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guards Polo Club|url=http://www.guardspoloclub.com/tournaments/jack-wills-varsity-polo|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Sports Federation|url=http://www.sport.ox.ac.uk/jack-wills-varsity-polo-match/#.UglA2hY-1d0}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and from 2016 onwards the La Martina Varsity &lt;ref&gt;http://www.atlanticpolo.com/#!timetable/xggsq&lt;/ref&gt;).  Members of both teams are traditionally known as [[Blue (university sport)|Blues]], with [[Oxford]] in dark blue and [[Cambridge]] in light blue.

The match is a well-established and popular fixture in the British sporting calendar with up to 5000 spectators in single years and creates an interest which a game between teams of far more seasoned players often fail to do.&lt;ref&gt;The Inter-University Match. In: The Times. 11 July 1938, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Victory. In: Horse and Hounds. 12 June 1970&lt;/ref&gt; It usually takes place at the beginning of June at Guards Polo Club. The Varsity Match was most recently contested in June 2018, and was won by Oxford by a margin of 13 – 0. As of 2018 Oxford has won the match 63 times and Cambridge 57 times.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.guardspoloclub.com/tournaments-and-results/la-martina-varsity-day-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Historically speaking, the Varsity Polo Match is the second oldest continuing polo match with the inter-regimental match proceeding it by only 7 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Army Polo|url=http://www.britisharmypolo.org/tournaments--events.html|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Varsity match was played in 1878. The event has been held annually with the exceptions of the two World Wars as well as 1894, 1900, 1960–61 and 1963.  The match was originally played at [[Hurlingham Club]], but moved to Woolmers Park as well as to [[Cowdray Park, West Sussex|Cowdray Park]] after World War II. From 1962 onwards, the venue for the match was decided annually, with the choice alternating with each university. Since 1994, the Varsity Match is played at [[Guards Polo Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Polo Club Archive|url=http://www.oxforduniversitypoloclub.com/index.php/archive|accessdate=12 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025122048/http://www.oxforduniversitypoloclub.com/index.php/archive|archivedate=25 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Match is played for a Challenge Cup presented by the Hurlingham Club in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Polo Year Book, 1925|year=1925|publisher=Hurlingham Polo Association|location=London|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitors==
The match format is extremely unusual as it is traditionally not handicapped. Teams are also mixed which is a rare opportunity amongst the Blues sports of both universities. The original conditions are as followed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
No player eligible who has been a member of his University for more than four years, or who has not been in residence during the term in which the match takes place. Instituted in 1878. Played generally at Hurlingham, in June. (Modern Polo, 1896&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Polo|year=1896|publisher=E.D. Miller|page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
No player eligible who has been a member of his University for more than four years, or who has not been in residence during the term in which the match takes place. The Cup shall be held by the winning University in each year until May 1st in the succeeding year, when it shall be returned to The Hurlingham Club. Play – 6 periods.
(The Polo Yearbook 1939&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Polo Yearbook|year=1939|publisher=County Polo Association|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Old Blues Match==
The main varsity match is preceded by a match between the two Old Blues teams. This match has a similar tradition to the Varsity Match as it is held annually and its records go back to 1879 (with major gaps in the statistic). It was known by the title Old Oxonians vs Old Cantabs. In the past, both teams helped to promote British polo not just on Varsity Day but also in other tournaments and events and were seen as one of the strongest British polo teams until World War II brought an end to that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dale|first=T. F.|authorlink=Thomas Francis Dale|title=Polo. Past and Present|year=1905|publisher=Country Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results and statistics ==
A selection of the more frequently cited statistics includes:

* Number of wins: Oxford, 63; Cambridge, 57 
* Most consecutive victories: Oxford, 8 (1966–73)
* Match record: Oxford, 2016 winning 19 – 0

'''The Y Plan''' is an exercise programme devised by [[Lesley Mowbray]] and [[Jill Gaskell]] for the London [[YMCA]], and very popular in United Kingdom during the 1990s. Choreographed by [Jane S. Linter] Emphasising short but regular workouts without any specialist equipment, the first book based on the programme, titled ''The Y Plan'', was published in 1990. Television presenter [[Anthea Turner]] was the public face of The Y Plan, appearing alongside the creators in numerous books, videos and magazine features. 
A further video was made, entitled Y-Plan countdown, in which one does an exercise regime of 36 days, with 3 levels of difficulty.

A '''wrestling singlet''' (or simply '''singlet''') is a one-piece, tight-fitting, colored uniform, usually made of [[spandex|spandex/lycra]], or [[nylon]], used in [[amateur wrestling]]. The uniform is tight fitting so as not to get grasped accidentally by one's opponent, and allows the referee to see each wrestler's body clearly when awarding points or a [[Pin (amateur wrestling)|pin]]. Unlike [[judo]], it is illegal to grasp an opponent's clothing in all styles of amateur wrestling.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Look of a singlet==
In most [[high school]] and [[college]] [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]] matches, the competitors wear singlets in their team colors. To designate a competitor's color for scoring purposes a red or green anklet is also worn.

Outside school competition (e.g., in international wrestling: [[Freestyle wrestling|freestyle]] and [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]]) wrestlers bring a red and a blue singlet (or reversible singlet) and are told before the match which color to wear.

Singlets are also common among [[professional wrestling|professional wrestlers]] (such as [[Bret Hart]], [[Kurt Angle]], and [[Rob Van Dam]]). Many of these are much more stylized than those worn by amateurs, although the use of singlets in professional wrestling has declined in the last two decades.

==Other clothing==
The singlet did not become common in college wrestling until the late 1960s and early 1970s; in fact, it had been banned by the [[NCAA]] for years. Shirtless uniforms, including trunks and tights, were common until the NCAA banned shirtless wrestling in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

A new style of singlet, known as a double or doublet, has recently emerged in college wrestling that covers more of the upper body.  Made of the same Lycra material, this singlet has more of a [[t-shirt]] covering than the traditional thin-strap singlet more commonly worn. This type of singlet is usually worn with accompanying tight-fitting shorts. This style of singlet is currently only allowed on the college level, although there is report that some high school wrestlers use this singlet style in practice sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Only with special permission are wrestlers allowed to wear a t-shirt under their singlet, most commonly for sanitary reasons involving excessive [[acne]] on the chest or back.

==Singlet cuts==
[[Image:Wrestling states005 edit.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The wrestler here is wearing a high cut, white singlet.]]
There are three different traditional "cuts" to wrestling singlets: the high cut, the [[United World Wrestling|FILA]] cut, and the low cut.

The high-cut covers most of the chest and reaches up to the under-arms on the side.

The FILA-cut is like the high cut but does not rise up as high beneath the arms.

The low-cut singlet is a revealing singlet, that allows greater range of mobility, keeps its wearer cooler, tends to be more comfortable when not on the mat (wrestlers tend to wear their singlets under their clothes nearly all day in some circumstances). The low-cut reaches down to the middle abdomen in the front, reaches down to the hips on the sides, and features a single strap that runs up the back that is very thin.

Low-cut singlets can no longer be worn at the Olympics or World Championships. A high-cut or FILA-cut singlet is required for this level. Generally, low-cut singlets are not legal for high school wrestling in the United States and likely will not be legal for off-season wrestling in the near future.{{fact|date=October 2015}}

==Underwear==
Underneath the singlet, wrestlers can wear nothing, a [[jockstrap]], [[compression shorts]], or regular [[briefs]].  A jockstrap used to be required for youth, high school and college levels.  Weigh-ins have been done traditionally with the grappler in just their jockstrap, or in the nude to make weight; however, with recent shifts in trends and with girls being allowed to join wrestling teams, youth and high school programs have changed rules requiring males to have their backsides covered, so at least wearing briefs, but not nude or in a jock.  Because of this change, as well as a change in trends, jockstrap use has sharply declined in wrestling. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.misterpoll.com/polls/126914/results&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
During a telecast between the [[Arizona Wildcats]] and [[Washington Huskies]] in [[Seattle]] for [[ESPN]] commentator [[Bill Walton]] wore a Husky singlet while commentating the game. He and announcer [[Dave Pasch]] had practiced with the Washington crew team earlier that day.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.thenewstribune.com/uwsports/2015/02/13/arizona-wins-86-62-laugher-over-reeling-huskies/&lt;/ref&gt;
