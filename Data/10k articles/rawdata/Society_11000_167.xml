'''Aimee Semple McPherson''' (''Aimée'', in the original French; October 9, 1890&amp;nbsp;– September 27, 1944), also known as '''Sister Aimee''' or simply '''Sister''', was a Canadian-American [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and media [[celebrity]] in the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;ref name= "WVobit"&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', October 4, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; famous for founding the [[International Church of the Foursquare Gospel|Foursquare Church]]. McPherson has been noted as a pioneer in the use of modern media, because she used radio to draw on the growing appeal of popular entertainment in North America and incorporated other forms into her weekly sermons at [[Angelus Temple]], one of the first [[Mega-church|megachurches]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30148022&lt;/ref&gt;

In her time she was the most publicized [[Protestant]] evangelist, surpassing [[Billy Sunday]] and her other predecessors.&lt;ref name= "autogenerated308"&gt;{{Citation | first1 = George Hunston | last1 = Williams | first2 = Rodney Lawrence | last2 = Petersen | first3 = Calvin Augustine | last3 = Pater | title = The Contentious Triangle: Church, State, and University | publisher = Truman State University Press | year = 1999 | page = 308}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newspapers1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19310302.2.46 |type= newspaper article | title = Aimée Mcpherson in Singapore |publisher= The Straits Times, 2 March 1931, Page 11|accessdate= 2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; She conducted public [[faith healing]] demonstrations before large crowds; testimonies conveyed tens of thousands of people healed.&lt;ref&gt;Aimee Semple McPherson Audio Tapes, http://www2.wheaton.edu/bgc/archives/GUIDES/103.htm#602&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Daniel Mark, ''Sister Aimee: The Life of Aimee Semple McPherson'' (Orlando: Harcourt Brace &amp; Co., 1993), p. 111.&lt;br&gt;"The healings present a monstrous obstacle to scientific historiography. If events transpired as newspapers, letters, and testimonials say they did, then Aimée Semple McPherson's healing ministry was miraculous...The documentation is overwhelming: very sick people came to Sister Aimee by the tens of thousands, blind, deaf, paralyzed. Many were healed some temporarily, some forever. She would point to heaven, to Christ the Great Healer and take no credit for the results."&lt;/ref&gt; McPherson's articulation of the [[United States]] as a nation founded and sustained by [[divine inspiration]] continues to be echoed by many pastors in churches today.

News coverage sensationalized her misfortunes with family and church members; particularly inflaming accusations she had fabricated [[Reported kidnapping of Aimee Semple McPherson|her reported kidnapping]], turning it into a national spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-incredible-disappearing-evangelist-572829/ |title=The Incredible Disappearing Evangelist |publisher= Smithsonian | accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; McPherson's preaching style, extensive charity work and ecumenical contributions were a major influence to [[Charismatic Christianity]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/books/529/rd10q:_aimee_semple_mcpherson,_evangelical_maverick |title= RD10Q: Aimee Semple McPherson, Evangelical Maverick |publisher= Religion Dispatches |date=2008-09-26 |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "SuttonWildfire"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/%22Between+the+refrigerator+and+the+wildfire%22%3A+Aimee+Semple+McPherson,...-a098978379 |title="Between the refrigerator and the wildfire": Aimee Semple McPherson, pentecostalism, and the fundamentalist-modernist controversy |publisher= The free library |date= |accessdate= 2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
McPherson was born '''Aimee Elizabeth Kennedy''' in the upstairs room of the family farmhouse outside the village of [[Salford, Ontario|Salford]], southeast of [[Ingersoll, Ontario|Ingersoll]] in [[Oxford County, Ontario|Oxford County]] [[Ontario]], Canada, to James Morgan and Mildred Ona (Pearce) Kennedy (1871–1947).&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Avery Sutton, ''[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674032538 Aimee Semple McPherson and the Resurrection of Christian America]'' (Cambridge: [[Harvard University Press]], 2007), page 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/archives/la-me-aimee-semple-mcpherson-19440928-story.html "From the Archives: Aimee Semple McPherson Dies Suddenly in Oakland"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (September 28, 1944) Retrieved August 26, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edith Waldvogel Blumhofer, Aimee Semple McPherson: everybody's sister (Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, Inc., 1993), pp.24, 43-44&lt;/ref&gt; She had early exposure to religion through her mother, Mildred&amp;nbsp;(known as "Minnie") who worked with the poor in [[Salvation Army]] soup kitchens.

As a child she would play "Salvation Army" with her classmates, and at home she would gather a congregation with her dolls, giving them a sermon.&lt;ref name="Sutton, p. 9"&gt;Sutton, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, McPherson strayed from her mother's teachings by reading novels and going to movies and dances, activities which were strongly disapproved of by both the Salvation Army and the religion of her father, James Kennedy, a [[Methodism|Methodist]]. Novels, though, made their way into the Methodist church library and with guilty delight, McPherson would read them. At the movies, she recognized some of her fellow Methodist church members. She learned too, at a local dance she attended, that her dancing partner was a Presbyterian minister. In high school, she was taught [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[Theory of Evolution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; She began to quiz visiting preachers and local pastors about faith and science, but was unhappy with the answers she received.&lt;ref name="Sutton, p. 10"&gt;Sutton, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote to the Canadian newspaper, ''Family Herald and Weekly Star'', questioning why taxpayer-funded public schools had courses, such as evolution, which undermined Christianity.&lt;ref name="Sutton, p. 10"/&gt; This was her first exposure to fame, as people nationwide responded to her letter.&lt;ref name="Sutton, p. 10"/&gt; While still in high school, after her Pentecostal conversion, McPherson began a crusade against the concept of evolution, beginning a lifelong passion.

=== Conversion ===
[[File:Semples.jpeg|right|frame|Robert and Aimee Semple (1910)]]
While attending a revival meeting in December 1907, Aimee met Robert James Semple, a [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] [[missionary]] from [[Ireland]]. There, her faith crisis ended as she decided to dedicate her life to God and made the conversion to Pentecostalism as she witnessed the Holy Spirit moving powerfully.&lt;ref name="Sutton, p. 10"/&gt;

=== Marriage and family ===
At that same revival meeting, Aimee became enraptured not only by the message that Robert Semple gave, but also with Robert. She decided to dedicate her life to both God and Robert, and after a short courtship, they were married on August 12, 1908, in a Salvation Army ceremony, pledging never to allow their marriage to lessen their devotion to God, affection for comrades, or faithfulness in the Army. The pair's notion of "Army" was very broad, encompassing much more than just the Salvation Army. Robert supported them as a foundry worker and preached at the local Pentecostal mission. Together, they studied the Bible, Aimee claiming Robert taught her all she knew; though other observers state she was far more knowledgeable than she let on. After a few months they moved to Chicago and became part of [[William Howard Durham|William Durham]]'s Full Gospel Assembly. Durham earlier had visited the mission where the [[Azusa Street Revival]] was taking place, returned and applied its teachings. Under Durham's tutelage, Aimee was discovered to have a unique ability in the interpretation of [[glossolalia|speaking in tongues]], translating with stylistic eloquence.&lt;ref&gt;Edith Waldvogel Blumhofer, Aimee Semple McPherson: everybody's sister (Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, Inc., 1993), pp.79- 81&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Harold and Aimee Semple McPherson.jpg|thumb|right|Aimee Semple and her second husband Harold McPherson. For a time Harold traveled with his wife Aimee in the "Gospel Car"as an itinerant preacher, helping her to set up tents for revival meetings.]]

After embarking on an evangelistic tour to [[China]], both contracted [[malaria]]. Robert also contracted [[dysentery]], of which he died in Hong Kong. Aimee recovered and gave birth to their daughter, [[Roberta Semple Salter|Roberta Star Semple]], as a 19-year-old widow. On board a ship returning to the United States, Aimee Semple started a Sunday school class, then held other services, as well, oftentimes mentioning her late husband in her sermons; almost all passengers attended.

Shortly after her recuperation in the United States, Semple joined her mother Minnie working with the Salvation Army. While in New York City, she met Harold Stewart McPherson, an accountant. They were married on May 5, 1912, moved to [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and had a son, [[Rolf McPherson|Rolf Potter Kennedy McPherson]], in March 1913.

During this time, McPherson felt as though she denied her "calling" to go preach. After struggling with emotional distress and [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]], she would fall to weep and pray.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; She felt the call to preach tug at her even more strongly after the birth of Rolf. Then in, 1914, she fell seriously ill, and McPherson states she again heard the persistent voice, asking her to go preach while in the holding room after a failed operation. McPherson accepted the voice's challenge, and she suddenly opened her eyes and was able to turn over in bed without pain. One spring morning in 1915, her husband returned home from the night shift to discover McPherson had left him and taken the children. A few weeks later, a note was received inviting him to join her in evangelistic work.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, pp. 74–76&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LAPL ASM honymoon breakfast 00036723.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Aimee Semple McPherson and her third husband, David L. Hutton, enjoying their honeymoon breakfast. To avoid news publicity, they chartered a plane to Yuma, Arizona; and were married in a small ceremony. Hutton assisted in some of McPherson's charity work before their divorce in 1934.]]

Her husband later followed McPherson to take her back home though changed his mind after he saw her preaching to a crowd. Describing his wife as "radiant, more lovely than he had ever seen her," he joined her in evangelism. Their house in Providence was sold and he joined her in setting up tents for revival meetings and even did some preaching.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, pp. 91, 95, 128&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout their journey, food and accommodations were uncertain, as they lived out of the "Gospel Car". Her husband, in spite of initial enthusiasm, wanted a life that was more stable and predictable. Eventually, he returned to Rhode Island and around 1918 filed for separation. He petitioned for divorce, citing abandonment; the divorce was granted in 1921.

She married again on September 13, 1931, to actor and musician David Hutton, followed by much drama, after which she fainted and fractured her skull.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; While McPherson was away in Europe to recover, she was angered to learn Hutton was billing himself as "Aimee's man" in his [[cabaret]] singing act and was frequently photographed with scantily clad women. Hutton's much-publicized personal scandals were damaging the Foursquare Gospel Church and their leader's credibility with other churches.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, pp. 374–375&lt;/ref&gt; McPherson and Hutton separated in 1933 and divorced on March 1, 1934. McPherson later publicly repented of the marriage, as wrong from the beginning, for both theological&lt;ref&gt;Blumhofer, p. 333. Note: in 1932, after having to continuously answer questions about McPherson's marriage to Hutton, 33 Foursquare ministers thought this was too much of a distraction and seceded from the Temple and formed their own Pentecostal denomination, the Open Bible Evangelistic Association.&lt;/ref&gt; and personal reasons&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 434&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore rejected nationally known gospel singer [[Homer Rodeheaver]], a more appropriate suitor, when he eventually asked for her hand in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Blumhofer, p. 333. Note: Homer Rodeheaver, former singing master for evangelist [[Billy Sunday]], was refused; even when it was suggested she married the wrong man and to try again to have a loving marriage, she responded negatively and redoubled her evangelistic efforts, forsaking personal fulfillment in relationships. McPherson knew Rodeheaver from working with him at the Angeleus Temple and he introduced her to David Hutton. In the case of Rodeheaver, however, biographer Sutton, according to Roberta Star Semple, stated McPherson liked him but not the way he kissed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Aimee May Marry Homer Rodeheaver'' (North Tonawanda, NY Evening News June 21, 1935)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
While married to Robert Semple, the two moved to Chicago and became part of [[William Howard Durham|William Durham]]'s Full Gospel Assembly. There, Aimee was discovered to have a unique ability in the interpretation of [[glossolalia]], translating with stylistic eloquence the otherwise indecipherable utterances of speaking in tongues. Unable to find fulfillment as a housewife, in 1913, McPherson began evangelizing and holding tent revivals across the [[Sawdust trail|Sawdust Trail]] in the United States and Canada.

After her first successful visits, she had little difficulty with acceptance or attendance. Eager converts filled the pews of local churches which turned many recalcitrant ministers into her enthusiastic supporters. Frequently, she would start a revival meeting in a hall or church and then have to move to a larger building to accommodate the growing crowds. When no buildings were suitable, she set up a tent, which was often filled past capacity.

She wanted to create the enthusiasm a Pentecostal meeting could provide, with its "Amen Corner" and "Halleluiah Chorus", but also to avoid its unbridled chaos as participants started shouting, trembling on the floor, and speaking in tongues, all at once. McPherson organized her meetings with the general public in mind and yet did not wish to quench any who suddenly came into "the Spirit". To this, she set up a "tarry tent or room" away from the general area for any who suddenly started speaking in tongues or display any other [[Holy Ghost]] behavior by which the larger audience might be put off.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, McPherson embarked on a tour of the Southern United States in her "Gospel Car", and again later, in 1918, with her mother, Mildred Kennedy. Mildred was an important addition to McPherson's ministry and managed everything, including the money, which gave them an unprecedented degree of financial security. Their vehicle was a 1912 [[Packard]] touring car emblazoned with religious slogans. Standing on the back seat of the convertible, McPherson preached sermons over a megaphone. On the road between sermons, she would sit in the back seat typing sermons and other religious materials. She first traveled up and down the eastern United States, then went to other parts of the country.

By 1917, she had started her own magazine, ''Bridal Call'', for which she wrote many articles about women's roles in religion; she portrayed the link between Christians and Jesus as a marriage bond. Along with taking seriously the religious role of women, the magazine contributed to transforming Pentecostalism from a movement into an ongoing American religious presence.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America'', Keller, Rosemary Skinner; Ruether, Rosemary Radford (Indiana University Press, 2006) p. 406-407&lt;/ref&gt;

While McPherson was traveling for her evangelical work, she arrived in Baltimore, where she was first "discovered" by the newspapers in 1919, after a day of conducting evangelistic services at the Lyric Opera House.&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/1655208322&lt;/ref&gt; Baltimore became one of the pivotal points for her early career.&lt;ref&gt;Edith Waldvogel Blumhofer, ''Aimee Semple McPherson: everybody's sister'' (Grand Rapids: [[Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing]], Inc., 1993), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; The crowds, in their religious ecstasy, were barely kept under control as they gave way to manifestations of "the Spirit". Moreover, her alleged faith healings now became part of the public record, and attendees began to focus on that part of her ministry over all else. McPherson also considered the Baltimore Revival an important turning point, not only for her ministry, "but in the history of the outpouring of the Pentecostal power".&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, pp. 170–172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career in Los Angeles ===
In late 1918, McPherson came to Los Angeles, a move many at the time were making for better opportunities. Minnie Kennedy, her mother, rented the largest hall they could find, the 3,500-seat [[Philharmonic Auditorium]] (known then as Temple Auditorium). People waited for hours to get in, and McPherson could hardly reach the pulpit without stepping on someone.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, grateful attendees of her Los Angeles meetings built a home for her family and her, which included everything from the cellar to a canary bird.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Los Angeles had become a popular vacation spot. Rather than touring the United States to preach her sermons, McPherson stayed in [[Los Angeles]], drawing audiences from a population which had soared from 100,000 in 1900 to 575,000 people in 1920, and often included many visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aimeemcpherson.com/ |title=Aimee McPherson |publisher=Aimee McPherson |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wearied by constant traveling and having nowhere to raise a family, McPherson had settled in Los Angeles, where she maintained both a home and a church. McPherson believed that by creating a church in Los Angeles, her audience would come to her from all over the country. This, she felt, would allow her to plant seeds of the Gospel and tourists would take it home to their communities, still reaching the masses. For several years, she continued to travel and raise money for the construction of a large, domed church building at 1100 Glendale Blvd. in the [[Echo Park, Los Angeles, California|Echo Park]] area of Los Angeles. The church would be named [[Angelus Temple]], reflecting the Roman Catholic tradition of the [[Angelus bell]], calling the faithful to prayer, as well as its reference to the angels.&lt;ref name="Blumhofer p. 246"&gt;Blumhofer, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Not wanting to take on debt, McPherson located a construction firm which would work with her as funds were raised "by faith".&lt;ref&gt;Blumhofer, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; She started with $5,000.&lt;ref&gt;More than $65,000 in 2012 dollars.&lt;/ref&gt; The firm indicated it would be enough to carve out a hole for the foundation.

McPherson began a campaign in earnest and was able to mobilize diverse groups of people to help fund and build the new church. Various fundraising methods were used, such as selling chairs for Temple seating at US $25&lt;ref&gt;over $320 in 2012&lt;/ref&gt; apiece. In exchange, "chair-holders" got a miniature chair and encouragement to pray daily for the person who would eventually sit in that chair. Her approach worked to generate enthusiastic giving and to create a sense of ownership and family among the contributors.&lt;ref&gt;Blumhofer, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ASM-AngelusTemple Plaque 1923 02.jpg|270px|thumbnail|left|McPherson dedicating Angelus Temple in 1923.]]

Raising more money than she had hoped, McPherson altered the original plans, and built a "[[megachurch]]" that would draw many followers throughout the years. The endeavor cost contributors around $250,000&lt;ref&gt;More than $3.2 million in 2012 dollars.&lt;/ref&gt; in actual money spent. However, this price was low for a structure of its size. Costs were kept down by donations of building materials and volunteer labor.&lt;ref name="Blumhofer p. 246"/&gt; McPherson sometimes quipped when she first got to California, all she had was a car, ten dollars&lt;ref&gt;over US $130 in 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and a tambourine.&lt;ref name="Blumhofer p. 246"/&gt; Enrollment grew exceeding 10,000, and was advertised to be the largest single Christian congregation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Lately ''Storming Heaven: The Lives and Turmoils of Minnie Kennedy and Aimee Semple McPherson'' (Morrow, New York, 1970) p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; According to church records, Angelus Temple received 40 million visitors within the first seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Bridal Call (Foursquare Publications, 1100 Glendale Blvd, Los Angeles.) October 1929, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

McPherson intended the Angelus Temple as both a place of worship and an ecumenical center for persons of all [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Christian denominations|faiths]] to meet and build alliances. A wide range of clergy and laypeople consisted of [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Baptists]], the [[The Salvation Army|Salvation Army]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]], [[Adventism|Adventists]], [[Quakers]], [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], [[Mormons]], and even secular civic leaders, who came to the Angelus Temple. They were welcomed and many made their way to her podium as guest speakers.&lt;ref name="SuttonWildfire"/&gt; Eventually, even Rev. [[Robert P. Shuler]], a once-robust McPherson critic, was featured as a guest preacher.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt;

Because [[Pentecostalism]] was not popular in the United States during the 1920s, McPherson avoided the label. She practiced [[glossolalia|speaking-in-tongues]] and [[faith healing]] within her services, but kept the former to a minimum in sermons to appease mainstream audiences. Discarded medical fittings from persons faith-healed during her services, which included crutches, wheelchairs, and other paraphernalia, were gathered for display in a museum area. As evidence of her early influence by the Salvation Army, McPherson adopted a theme of "lighthouses" for the satellite churches, referring to the parent church as the "Salvation Navy". This was the beginning of McPherson working to plant Foursquare Gospel churches around the country.

===Charitable work===
[[File:ASMcPherson, 1935.jpg|thumb|McPherson (left) prepares Christmas food baskets (about 1935)|340px]]
McPherson strove to develop a church organization which could not only provide for the spiritual, but also the physical needs of the distressed. Though she fervently believed and preached the imminent return of Jesus Christ,&lt;ref&gt;Blumhofer, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; she had no idea of how soon that [[Second Coming]] might be. Two thoughts pervaded the mind of most devout Pentecostals of the time, "[[Jesus]] is coming, therefore how can I get ready," and "how can I help others to get ready?"

For McPherson, part of the answer was to mobilize her Temple congregation and everyone she could reach through radio, telephone, and word of mouth to get involved in substantial amounts of charity and social work. "True Christianity is not only to be good but to do good," she preached. The Charities and Beneficiary Department collected donations for all types of humanitarian relief to include a Japanese disaster, as well as a German relief fund. Men released from prison were found jobs by a "brotherhood". A "sisterhood" was created, as well, sewing baby clothing for impoverished mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Branch churches elsewhere in the country were likewise encouraged to follow the Angelus Temple's example. Even people who considered McPherson's theology almost ridiculous helped out because they saw her church as the best way to assist their community.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, pp. 186–191&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1925, after confirming reports of an [[1925 Santa Barbara earthquake|earthquake in Santa Barbara]], McPherson immediately left the parsonage and interrupted a broadcast at a nearby radio station. She took over the microphone from the startled singer and requested food, blankets, clothing, or whatever listeners could give for emergency supplies to assist nearby Santa Barbara. As the Red Cross met to discuss and organize aid, McPherson's second convoy had already arrived at the troubled city.&lt;ref&gt;Blumhofer, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, after [[St. Francis Dam|a dam failed]] and the ensuing flood left up to 600 dead in its wake, McPherson's church led the relief effort.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, pp. 189, 315. Note: author states over 400 dead&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1933, an [[1933 Long Beach earthquake|earthquake struck and devastated Long Beach.]] McPherson quickly arranged for volunteers to be on the scene with blankets, coffee, and doughnuts.&lt;ref&gt;Blumhofer, p. 348. Note: author indicates 1934 but probably a typo&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LAPL ASM Commissary Exterior 00075061.jpg|thumb|left|450px|Men wait in line to enter Aimee Semple McPherson's Angelus Temple Free Dining Hall &amp; Commissary, located at 2210 W. Temple Street. At the time she was married to David Hutton and all branding reflected his last name.]]

Drawing from her childhood experience with the Salvation Army, in 1927, McPherson opened a commissary at Angelus Temple which was virtually the only place in town a person could get food, clothing, and blankets with no questions asked. It was open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and became active in creating soup kitchens, free clinics, and other charitable activities as the Great Depression wore on. She fed an estimated 1.5 million people. When the government shut down the free school-lunch program, McPherson took it over. Her policy of giving first and investigating afterward "alleviated suffering on an epic scale".&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt;

McPherson got the fire and police departments to assist in distribution. Doctors, physicians, and dentists were persuaded to staff her free clinic that trained 500 nurses to help treat children and the elderly. She encouraged individuals and companies of all types to donate supplies, food, cash, or labor. To prevent the power from being turned off to homes of overdue accounts during the winter, a $2,000&lt;ref&gt;about US $28,000 in 2012&lt;/ref&gt; cash reserve was set up with the utility company. Many people, who otherwise would have nothing to do with the Angelus Temple, would receive a call from McPherson, and then loot their mansion closets or company stores for something to give. The Yellow Cab Company donated a large building and, in the first month, 80,000 people received meals there.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;

Laboring under a sign "Everybody and anybody is somebody to Jesus", volunteer workers filled commissary baskets with an assortment of food and other items, as well as Foursquare Gospel literature, and handed them out. Even a complete kit designed to care for newborn babies was available. A reporter wrote he had always thought the breadline was a "drab colorless scar on our civilization", but of the Angelus Temple commissary, he observed, was "the warm garment of sympathy and Christian succor."&lt;ref name="Sutton, p. 317"&gt;Sutton, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; 

Establishing an employment bureau, as well, McPherson desired to help "the discouraged husband, the despondent widow, or the little mother who wants extra work to bear the burden of a sick husband".&lt;ref&gt;Blumhofer, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; She expected everyone in her temple to be involved, 'let us ever strive to lighten our brother's load and dry the tears of a sister; race, creed or status make no difference. We are all one in the eyes of the Lord." She encouraged members to think of the commissary as widening "the spirituality of the whole church".&lt;ref&gt;Blumhofer, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:UCLA ASM charity Men in line.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Line of unemployed men getting meals at dining hall run by Aimee Semple McPherson, 1932.]]

In 1932, the commissary was raided by police, allegedly to locate a still used to make brandy out of donated apricots. Some sauerkraut and salad oil were purportedly observed leaking from their respective storage areas. As a consequence, the commissary was briefly shut down. The press got involved and the public demanded an investigation. Since no one really wanted to stall the temple's charity efforts, the acceptable solution was to replace the immediate management. The staff was let go and students from her Foursquare Gospel Church's LIFE Bible College filled in. The newspaper media, generally cynical of the Temple and in particular of McPherson, recognized "the excellent features of that organization's efforts" and that "the faults of the Angelus Temple are outweighed by its virtues."&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; McPherson issued a statement declaring, "They have clashed loud their cymbals and blown their trumpets about a still and some sauerkraut,... our work is still before us. If...anybody abused his trust, it must not happen again."&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, pp. 375–376&lt;/ref&gt;

As McPherson tried to avoid administrative delays in categorizing the "deserving" from the "undeserving," her temple commissary became known as one of the region's most effective and inclusive aid institutions. Few soup kitchens lasted more than several months, but McPherson's remained open.&lt;ref name="Sutton, p. 317"/&gt; Even as she transformed herself into a fashionable blonde Hollywood socialite, McPherson's vigor and practicality for social activism did not change; she loved organizing big projects.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, pp. 191–192&lt;/ref&gt; A 1936 survey indicated the Angelus Temple assisted more family units than any other public or private institution in the city. Because her programs aided nonresidents, as well, such as migrants from other states and Mexico, she ran afoul of California state regulations. Though temple guidelines were later officially adjusted to accommodate those policies, helping families in need was a priority, regardless of their place of residence.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor [[Anthony Quinn]] recalls:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This was all during the height of the Depression, when hunger and poverty permeated America. Many Mexicans were terrified of appealing for county help because most of them were in the country illegally. When in distress, they were comforted by the fact that they could call one of Aimee's branches at any time of the night. There, they would never be asked any of the embarrassing questions posed by the authorities. The fact that they were hungry or in need of warm clothing was enough. No one even asked if they belonged to Aimee's church or not.&lt;ref name="Anthony Quinn 1972 pp 122"&gt;Anthony Quinn, ''The Original Sin: A Self-Portrait'', Little, Brown and Company: Boston (1972), pp. 122–132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Ministry==

===Style of ministry ===
In August 1925 and away from Los Angeles, McPherson decided to charter a plane so she would not miss giving her Sunday sermon. Aware of the opportunity for publicity, she arranged for at least 2000 followers and members of the press to be present at the airport. The plane failed after takeoff and the landing gear collapsed, sending the nose of the plane into the ground. McPherson boarded another plane and used the experience as the narrative of an illustrated Sunday sermon called "The Heavenly Airplane".&lt;ref name="Sutton, p.72"&gt;Sutton, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The stage in Angelus Temple was set up with two miniature planes and a skyline that looked like Los Angeles. In this sermon, McPherson described how the first plane had the devil for the pilot, sin for the engine, and temptation as the propeller. The other plane, however, was piloted by Jesus and would lead one to the Holy City (the skyline shown on stage). The temple was filled beyond capacity.
[[File:WVBPC Angelus Temple d3e11459.jpg|thumb|left| Angelus Temple completed in 1923, is the center of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel founded by McPherson. In 1992, Angelus Temple was designated a National Historic Landmark. It is still in active use.|399x399px]]
On another occasion, she described being pulled over by a police officer, calling the sermon "Arrested for [[Speed limit|Speeding]]". Dressed in a traffic cop's uniform, she sat in the saddle of a police motorcycle, earlier placed on the stage, and revved the siren.&lt;ref name="Sutton, p.72"/&gt; One author in attendance, insisted she actually drove the motorcycle, with its deafening roar, across the access ramp to the pulpit, slammed on the brakes, then raised a white-gloved hand to shout "Stop! You're speeding to Hell!"&lt;ref&gt;Bach, Marcus, They Have Found a Faith, (The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Indianapolis / New York, 1946) p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Since McPherson gave some of her sermons more than once, and with variations, the possibility existed both versions might be true.

McPherson employed a small group of artists, electricians, decorators, and carpenters, who built the sets for each Sunday's service. Religious music was played by an orchestra. McPherson also worked on elaborate sacred operas. One production, ''The Iron Furnace'', based on the book of Exodus, told of God's deliverance as the Israelites fled slavery in Egypt. Some Hollywood movie stars even assisted with obtaining costumes from local studios. The cast was large, perhaps as many as 450 people, but so elaborate and expensive, it was presented only one time. Rehearsals for the various productions were time-consuming and McPherson "did not tolerate any nonsense." Though described as "always kind and loving", McPherson demanded respect regarding the divine message the sacred operas and her other works were designed to convey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foursquare.org/news/article/lessons_i_learned_from_sister_aimee |title=Lessons I Learned From Sister Aimee &amp;#124; Foursquare Legacy &amp;#124; The Foursquare Church |publisher=Foursquare.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:LAPL AngelusTempleInterior00034787.jpg|thumb|right|Aimee Semple McPherson surrounded by massed choirs at Angelus Temple for a musical requiem in 1929.|399x399px]]

Even though McPherson condemned theater and film as the devil's workshop, its secrets and effects were co-opted. She became the first woman evangelist to adopt the whole technique of the moving picture star.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; McPherson desired to avoid the dreary church service where, by obligation, parishioners would go to fulfill some duty by being present in the pew. She wanted a sacred drama that would compete with the excitement of vaudeville and the movies. The message was serious, but the tone more along the lines of a humorous musical comedy. Animals were frequently incorporated and McPherson, as a once farm girl, knew how to handle them. McPherson gave up to 22 sermons a week and the lavish Sunday night service attracted the largest crowds, extra [[Tram|trolleys]] and police were needed to help route the traffic through Echo Park to and from Angelus Temple.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p.252&lt;/ref&gt; To finance the Angelus Temple and its projects, collections were taken at every meeting, often with the admonishment, "no coins, please".&lt;ref name="dollartimes1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dollartimes.com/calculators/inflation.htm|title = Inflation Calculator|publisher = DollarTimes.com|date = |accessdate = 2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;$1 of 1920s to 1930s dollars would be worth around US $11–13 in 2013.

McPherson preached a conservative gospel, but used progressive methods, taking advantage of radio, movies, and stage acts. Advocacy for women's rights was on the rise, including women's suffrage through the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]]. She attracted some women associated with modernism, but others were put off by the contrast between her different theories. By accepting and using such new media outlets, McPherson helped integrate them into people's daily lives. McPherson used the media to her advantage and became the "first modern celebrity preacher."&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Nathan. "Spectacular Evangelist: Aimee Semple McPherson in the Fox Newsreel." The Moving Image: The Journal of the Association of Moving Image Archivists 14, no. 1 (April 1, 2014): 71–90. {{doi|10.5749/movingimage.14.1.0071}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LAPL ASM Performance00021729.jpg|thumb|left|Minister Aimee Semple McPherson and a group of tambourine players leading a service at Angelus Temple. She was very innovative in producing weekly dramas illustrating religious themes.|399x399px]]

The battle between fundamentalists and modernists escalated after [[World War I]], with many modernists seeking less conservative religious faiths.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamentalists generally believed their religious faith should influence every aspect of their lives. McPherson sought to eradicate modernism and secularism in homes, churches, schools, and communities. She developed a strong following in what McPherson termed "the Foursquare Gospel" by blending contemporary culture with religious teachings. McPherson was entirely capable of sustaining a protracted intellectual discourse as her Bible students and debate opponents will attest. But she believed in preaching the gospel with simplicity and power, so as to not confuse the message. Her distinct voice and visual descriptions created a crowd excitement "bordering on hysteria."&lt;ref name="Epstein, p. 156"&gt;Epstein, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

The appeal of McPherson's 30 or so revival events from 1919 to 1922 surpassed any touring event of theater or politics ever presented in American history. "Neither Houdini nor Teddy Roosevelt had such an audience nor PT Barnum."&lt;ref name="Epstein, p. 156"/&gt;  Her one- to four-week meetings typically overflowed any building she could find to hold them. She broke attendance records recently set by [[Billy Sunday]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated308"/&gt; and frequently used his temporary tabernacle structures in which to hold some of her meetings. Her revivals were often standing-room only. One such revival was held in a boxing ring, with the meeting before and after the match. Throughout the boxing event, she walked about with a sign reading "knock out the Devil". In [[San Diego, California]], the city called in the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] and other branches of the armed forces to control a revival crowd of over 30,000 people. She became one of the most photographed persons of her time. She enjoyed the publicity and quotes on almost every subject were sought from her by journalists.

===Faith healing ministry ===
{{main|Faith healing ministry of Aimee Semple McPherson}}
McPherson's ability to draw crowds was also greatly assisted by her apparently successful faith healing presentations. According to Nancy Barr Mavity, an early McPherson biographer, almost by accident, the evangelist discovered when she laid hands on sick or injured persons, they got well. Mavity further wrote, describing the healing power "beyond her conscience ''[sic]'' control" and "profoundly troubling" however a phenomenon familiar to the psychiatrist although "none the less ''[sic]'' mysterious." &lt;ref&gt;Mavity, Nancy Barr "Sister Aimee;" (Doubleday, Doran, Incorporated, 1931) p. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

During a 1916 revival meeting in Corona, Long Island, New York, a young woman in the advanced stages of rheumatoid arthritis was brought to the altar by friends. McPherson would have preferred to pray with her privately. However, the woman insisted upon immediate prayer. McPherson laid hands on her and prayed. Before the gathered parishioners, the woman walked out of the church without crutches. McPherson's reputation as a faith healer rapidly became known and the sick and injured people came to her by the tens of thousands.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein 1993, pp. 107–111&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Faith Healing Ministry of Aimee Semple McPherson]] was extensively written about in the news media and was a large part of her early career legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; No one has ever been credited by secular witnesses with anywhere near the numbers of faith healings attributed to McPherson, especially during the years 1919 to 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, though, she almost withdrew from the faith-healing aspect of her services, since it was overwhelming&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; other areas of her ministry. Scheduled weekly and monthly healing sessions nevertheless remained highly popular with the public until her death in 1944.

===The Foursquare Church===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Postcard-los-angeles-angelus-temple.png|thumb|right|Angelus Temple in Echo Park, Los Angeles, with radio towers]] --&gt;
[[File:Aimee Semple McPherson-AngelusTemple Sermon 1923 01.jpg|thumbnail|right|McPherson preaching at the newly built Angelus Temple in 1923: Her messages showcased the love of God, redemption, and the joys of service and heaven, contrasting sharply with the fire-and-brimstone style of sermon delivery popular with many of her peers.]]
Eventually, McPherson's church evolved into its own denomination and became known as the [[International Church of the Foursquare Gospel]] (usually referenced as the "Foursquare Church"). The term ''Foursquare'' represents the ''[[Full Gospel]]'' theological concept, and refers to the four defining beliefs of Pentecostalism: the nature of Jesus Christ's character is that he was Savior, baptizer with the Holy Spirit, healer, and soon-coming King. The four main beliefs were: the first being Christ's ability to transform individuals' lives through the act of salvation; the second focused on a holy baptism which includes receiving power to glorify and exalt Christ in a practical way; the third was divine healing, newness of life for both body and spirit; and the fourth was gospel-oriented heed to the premillennial return of Jesus Christ.

McPherson published the weekly ''Foursquare Crusader'', along with her monthly magazine, ''Bridal Call''. She began broadcasting on radio in the early 1920s. On a Sunday morning in April 1922, the Rockridge Radio Station in Oakland CA; offered her some radio time and she became the first woman to preach a sermon over the "wireless telephone."&lt;ref&gt;Blumhofer, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; With the opening of Foursquare Gospel-owned [[KEIB|KFSG]] on February 6, 1924, she became the second woman granted a broadcast license by the [[Department of Commerce]], the federal agency that supervised [[broadcasting]] in the early 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Von Lackum, Karl C. "Vinton Boasts Only Broadcasting Station in U.S. Owned By Woman", ''Waterloo Evening Courier'', Iowa, October 14, 1922, p.&amp;nbsp;7. Note: The first woman to receive a broadcasting license was Mrs. Marie Zimmerman of [[Vinton, Iowa]], in August 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;

McPherson racially integrated her tent meetings and church services. On one occasion, as a response to McPherson's ministry and Angelus Temple being integrated, [[Ku Klux Klan]] members were in attendance, but after the service, hoods and robes were found on the ground in nearby Echo Park.&lt;ref&gt;Blumhofer, pp. 275–277&lt;/ref&gt; She is also credited with helping many Hispanic ministries in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=nyorker&gt;{{cite news|last=Updike|first=John|title=Famous Aimee: The life of Aimee Semple McPherson|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/04/30/070430crbo_books_updike?currentPage=all|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=30 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McPherson traveling about the country holding widely popular revival meetings and filling local churches with converts was one thing, settling permanently into their city caused concern among some local Los Angeles churches. Though she shared many of their [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist beliefs]], such as divine inspiration of the Bible, the classical [[Trinity]], virgin birth of Jesus, historical reality of Christ's miracles, bodily resurrection of Christ, and the atoning purpose of his crucifixion; the presentation of lavish sermons, and an effective faith-healing ministry presented by a female divorcee whom thousands adored and about whom newspapers continuously wrote, was unexpected. Moreover, the Temple, especially the women, had a look and style uniquely theirs. They would emulate McPherson's style and dress, and a distinct Angelus Temple uniform came into existence, a white dress with a navy blue cape thrown over it.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; Men were more discreet, wearing suits. Her voice, projected over the powerful state-of-the-art KFSG radio station and heard by hundreds of thousands, became the most recognized in the western United States.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

Her illustrated sermons attracted criticism from some clergy members because they thought it turned the Gospel message into mundane theater and entertainment. Divine healing, as McPherson called it, was claimed by many pastors to be a unique dispensation granted only for [[Apostolic Age|Apostolic times]]. Rival radio evangelist Reverend [[Robert P. Shuler]] published a pamphlet entitled ''McPhersonism'', which purported that her "most spectacular and advertised program was out of harmony with God's word."&lt;ref&gt;Schuler, Robert P. ''McPhersonism: a study of healing cults and modern day tongues movements'', January, 1924, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Debates such as the [[Ben M. Bogard|Bogard]]-McPherson debate in 1934&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben M. Bogard]], Bogard-McPherson debate : McPhersonism, Holy Rollerism, miracles, Pentecostalism, divine healing : a debate with both sides presented fully, ([[Little Rock, Arkansas]]: Ben M. Bogard, 1934)&lt;/ref&gt; drew further attention to the controversy, but none could really argue effectively against McPherson's results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healingandrevival.com/BioCSPrice.htm |title=Biography of Charles S. Price |publisher=Healingandrevival.com |date=1947-03-08 |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earstohear.net/Price/testimony.html Note: Divine Healing was a contentious theological area of McPherson's ministry, but she was not alone. Other pastors already had a ministry with alleged successful healings such as James Moore Hickson (1868–1933), an Episcopalian of international renown. Another pastor, Dr. Charles S Price (1887–1947), went to a series of McPherson revival meetings in San Jose, California, to expose the fraud. Instead, he was converted and preached McPherson's version of Christianity to his congregation. Reports of purported faith healings began to take place. Price went on to preach as a traveling evangelist who converted tens of thousands along with many instances of miraculous divine healings allegedly occurring.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, pp. 185, 240&lt;/ref&gt;

The new developing [[Assemblies of God]] denomination, Pentecostal as McPherson was, for a time worked with her, but they encouraged separation from established Protestant faiths. McPherson resisted trends to isolate as a denomination and continued her task of coalition-building among evangelicals. McPherson worked hard to attain ecumenical vision of the faith, and while she participated in debates, avoided pitched rhetorical battles that divided so many in Christianity. She wanted to work with existing churches on projects and to share with them her visions and beliefs.

Assisting in her passion was the speedy establishment of LIFE Bible College adjacent to the Angeles Temple. Ministers trained there were originally intended to go nationally and worldwide to all denominations and share her newly defined "Foursquare Gospel." A well-known Methodist minister, Frank Thompson, who never had the Pentecostal experience,&lt;ref&gt;"Spiritual gifts" given by the Holy Spirit, of which the most well known is speaking in "tongues" the spontaneously speaking in a language unknown to the speaker;, also known as [[glossolalia]]. Other gifts include translating the said "tongues."&lt;/ref&gt; was persuaded to run the college, and he taught the students the doctrine of [[John Wesley]]. McPherson and others, meanwhile, infused them with Pentecostal ideals. For about a year, Antonia Frederick Futterer, suggested by Los Angeles Times as the inspiration for Steven Spielberg's film character, Indiana Jones, was also a facility member.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2001/sep/30/local/me-51701&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times (The Adventures of a Would-Be Raider of the Lost Ark), September 30, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; McPherson's efforts eventually led Pentecostals, which were previously unconventional and on the periphery of Christianity, into the mainstream of American evangelicalism.&lt;ref name="SuttonWildfire"/&gt;

==Life in the media spotlight==

===Media relations===
By early 1926, McPherson had become one of the most charismatic and influential women and ministers of her time. Her fame equaled, to name a few, [[Charles Lindbergh]], [[Johnny Weissmuller]], [[Jack Dempsey]], [[Babe Ruth]], [[Ty Cobb]], [[Knute Rockne]], [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], [[Louise Brooks]], and [[Rudolph Valentino]].&lt;ref&gt;Ralph G. Giordano, ''Satan in the Dance Hall: Rev. John Roach Straton, Social Dancing, and Morality in 1920s New York City'' (Scarecrow Press, Oct 23, 2008), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; She was a major American phenomenon, who along with some other high-profile preachers of the time, unlike Hollywood celebrities, could be admired by their adoring public, "without apparently compromising their souls."&lt;ref&gt;George Hunston Williams, Rodney Lawrence Petersen, Calvin Augustine Pater, ''The Contentious Triangle: Church, State, and University'' (Truman State University Press, 1999), p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aimee Semple McPherson.jpg|thumb|right|225px|McPherson (early 1920s)]] 
According to Carey McWilliams, she had become "more than just a household word: she was a folk hero and a civic institution; an honorary member of the fire and police departments; a patron saint of the service clubs; an official spokesman for the community on problems grave and frivolous."&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Matthew. ''[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674032538 Aimee Semple McPherson and the Resurrection of Christian America]''. London: [[Harvard University Press]], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; She was influential in many social, educational and political areas. McPherson made personal crusades against anything that she felt threatened her Christian ideals, including the drinking of alcohol and teaching evolution in schools.

McPherson became a strong supporter of [[William Jennings Bryan]] during the 1925 [[Scopes trial]], in which John Scopes was tried for illegally teaching evolution at a [[Dayton, Tennessee]], school. Bryan and McPherson had worked together in the Angelus Temple and they believed Darwinism had undermined students' morality. According to ''The New Yorker'', McPherson said, evolution "is the greatest triumph of Satanic intelligence in 5,931 years of devilish warfare, against the Hosts of Heaven. It is poisoning the minds of the children of the nation."&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 52. Note: Sutton was uncertain if McPherson actually stated the quote as reported by ''The New Yorker'', but she did convey evolution influenced moral-relativist philosophers and believed "survival of the fittest" thinking would have a detrimental effect on society.&lt;/ref&gt; She sent Bryan a telegram saying, "Ten thousand members of Angelus Temple with her millions of radio church membership send grateful appreciation of your lion-hearted championship of the Bible against evolution and throw our hats in the ring with you."&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, pp. 37, 52&lt;/ref&gt; She organized "an all-night prayer service, a massive church meeting preceded by a Bible parade through Los Angeles."&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
While her mother Mildred Kennedy was a registered Democrat, no one was certain of McPherson's registration. She endorsed [[Herbert Hoover]] over [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], but enthusiastically threw her support behind the latter and his social programs when he was elected into office.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; She was a patron of [[Trade union|organized labor]], preaching a [[gangster]]'s money was "no more unclean than the [[Criticism of capitalism|dollars of the man who amasses his millions from underpaid factory workers]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; She was more cautious, though, when labor strikes resulted in violent uprisings. She saw in them the possible activities of [[Communism]], which sought to infiltrate labor unions and other organizations. McPherson intensely disliked Communism and its derivatives as they sought to rule without God; their ultimate goal, she believed, was to remove Christianity from the earth. McPherson's opinion of [[fascism]] fared no better; its totalitarian rule was wrongly justified by claiming to represent the power of God.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

McPherson did not align herself consistently with any broad [[Conservatism|conservative]] or [[Liberalism|liberal]] political agenda. Instead, she explained if Christianity occupied a central place in national life, and if the components of God, home, school and government were kept together, everything else would fall into place.

It is not accurate to draw a parallel between today's extreme fundamentalist, right-wing Christianity and the style or focus of Sister McPherson."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foursquare.org/news/article/sister_aimee_to_air_on_pbs |title="Sister Aimee" to Air on PBS &amp;#124; Foursquare News &amp;#124; The Foursquare Church |publisher=Foursquare.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also among the first prominent Christian ministers to defend the establishment of a [[Christian Restorationism|Jewish homeland]] in Palestine.

==Reported kidnapping==

{{main|Reported kidnapping of Aimee Semple McPherson}}
[[File:UCLA MildredKennedy Diver.jpg|thumb|left|Minnie Kennedy doing radio interview with deep-sea diver R.C. Crawford during search for McPherson's body in Santa Monica, Calif., 1926|300px]]
The [[reported kidnapping of Aimee Semple McPherson]] caused a frenzy in national media and changed her life and the course of her career. After disappearing in May, 1926, she reappeared in Mexico five weeks later, stating she had been held for ransom in a desert shack there. The subsequent grand-jury inquiries over her reported kidnapping and escape precipitated continued public interest in her future misfortunes.&lt;ref&gt;Zaballos, Nausica. ''La disparition de Soeur Aimée'' ( Crimes et Procès Sensationnels à Los Angeles, Paris, 2011), pp. 103–140&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disappearance and return===
On May 18, 1926, McPherson disappeared from  Ocean Park Beach, in Santa Monica, CA, Presuming she had drowned, Searchers combed the beach and nearby area, but could not locate her body. Immediately, McPherson sightings occurred  around the county often in widely divergent locations many miles apart on the same day.  The Angelus Temple received calls and letters claiming knowledge of McPherson, including demands for ransom.  After several weeks of unpromising leads, Mildred Kennedy, regarded the messages as hoaxes, believing her daughter dead.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Raymond L. ''The Verdict is In,'' ( R.L. Cox and Heritage Committee, California, 1983), pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as the Angeles Temple was preparing for a service commemorating McPherson's death, on June 23, Kennedy received a phone call from [[Douglas, Arizona]]. Her distraught daughter was alive resting in a Douglas hospital, and was relating her story to officials.

On the far right, Deputy District Attorney Joseph Ryan is alongside her son, Rolf McPherson.|350x350px]]

McPherson stated, at the beach, she had been approached by a couple who wanted her to pray over their sick child.  Walking with them to their car, she suddenly was shoved inside.  A cloth laced with some type of drug was held against her face, causing her to pass out. Eventually, the revivalist was moved to a small shack in the Mexican desert. When her captors were away on errands, McPherson escaped out a window. &lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Aimee Semple, In the Service of the King: The Story of My Life (Boni and Liveright, New York, 1927), p.16. Though McPherson, period newspapers and most biographers referred to one of the captors as "Rose," she later became known in some books and articles as "Mexicali Rose."&lt;/ref&gt;

She then traveled through the desert for around 11–13 hours across an estimated distance of 20 miles (32 km);  and reached [[Agua Prieta]], [[Sonora]], a Mexican border town at around 1:00 am.   Collapsing exhausted near a house, the evangelist was finally taken by locals to adjacent Douglas.

The turnout at her return to Los Angeles was greeted by 30,000–50,000 people, more than for almost any other personage. The parade back to the temple even elicited a greater turnout than President Woodrow Wilson's visit to Los Angeles in 1919, attesting to her popularity and the growing influence of mass media entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p.&amp;nbsp;103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://framework.latimes.com/2011/06/20/president-wilson-visits-l-a/#/0 |title=President Wilson visits L.A. - Framework - Photos and Video - Visual Storytelling from the Los Angeles Times |publisher=Framework.latimes.com |date=2011-06-20 |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melton, J. Gordon. (2007). ''The Encyclopedia of Religious Phenomena''. Visible Ink Press. p.&amp;nbsp;218&lt;/ref&gt; Already incensed over McPherson's influential public stance on evolution and the Bible, most of the Chamber of Commerce and some other civic leaders, together with many Los Angeles area churches; saw the event as a gaudy display.   To head off developing rumors her disappearance was not the result of a kidnapping, McPherson, against the advice of her mother, who thought the press would continue to unfavorably exploit the story; presented her complaint in court.

===Grand jury inquiries===
While various speculations were proffered as to the reason for McPherson's disappearance,  the Los Angeles prosecution settled on the contention McPherson ran off with ex-employee, Ormiston. She was accused of staying with him in a California seaside cottage he rented in a resort town prior to her May 18 disappearance.  After leaving the cottage at the end of May,  for the next three weeks, the pair traveled elsewhere and remained hidden.  Then, around June 22, Ormiston drove McPherson to Mexico, dropped her off 3 miles outside of  nearby Agua Prieta where she walked the remaining distance and presented herself to a resident there.   

McPherson maintained all along, without changing anything in her story, that she was taken, held captive by the kidnappers, and escaped as she originally described.   Defense witnesses corroborated her assertions &lt;ref&gt;Modesto Bee And News-Herald 20 October 1926, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''Vanishing Evangelist'' pp. 285-286, 291&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cox, pp. 85, 209–211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cox, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; or McPherson herself demonstrated how the disputed parts were plausible&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''Vanishing Evangelist'', p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues of trial by media and court of public opinion were apparent, as much of the proclaimed evidence against McPherson came from reporters who passed it on to the police.  Evidence and testimonies were hotly debated by an evenly divided public.  Secrecy of the California grand jury proceedings were ignored by both sides as the Los Angeles prosecution freely passed on any new developments to the press, while the evangelist used her radio station to broadcast her side of the story. &lt;ref name="ralphmag1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ralphmag.org/menckenZN.html |title=Isadora Duncan, Aime Semple McPherson - H.L. Mencken |publisher=Ralphmag.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case dismissal and aftermath===
On November 3, the case was to be moved to jury trial  set for mid-January, 1927. If convicted, the counts added up to a maximum prison time of 42 years.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The People vs.Aimee Semple McPherson, et al., Case CR 29181, 10 January 1927; Superior Court of Los Angeles County, County records and Archives&lt;/ref&gt;   However, the prosecution's case developed serious credibility issues. Witnesses changed their testimonies&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, pp. 312-313&lt;/ref&gt;  and evidence often had suspicious origins&lt;ref&gt;Cox, pp. 150-151, 152,166.&lt;/ref&gt;  or was mishandled and lost while in custody&lt;ref name="LatelyVanish"&gt;Lately, Thomas ''The Vanishing Evangelist: the Aimee Semple McPherson Kidnapping Affair'' (Viking Press, 1959) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cox, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, on January 2, 1927, Ormiston identified another woman as his female companion who stayed with him at the resort town seaside cottage.&lt;ref&gt;''The Coshocton Tribune''; Coshocton, Ohio January 3, 1927· Page 8&lt;/ref&gt;  All charges against McPherson and associated parties were dropped by the court for the lack of evidence on January 10, 1927.
 
Regardless of the court's decision, months of unfavorable press reports fixed in much of the public's mind a certainty of McPherson's wrongdoing.  The bulk of the investigation against McPherson was funded by Los Angeles-area newspapers at an estimated amount of $500,000.&lt;ref&gt;about US $6.4 million in 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

Various influential individuals offered their opinions on the inquiry.  The Reverend [[Robert P. Shuler]] stated, "Perhaps the most serious thing about this whole situation is the seeming loyalty of thousands to this leader in the face of her evident and positively proven guilt."&lt;ref&gt;Shuler, p. 188. Note: ''Los Angeles Times'', June 1927&lt;/ref&gt;   

H.L. Mencken, noted journalist, satirist, cultural critic, and scholar and an ideological opponent of McPherson, opposite each other in the 1925 Scopes "Monkey" trial, unexpectedly came to McPherson's defense. He wrote that since many of that town's residents acquired their ideas "of the true, the good and the beautiful" from the movies and newspapers, "Los Angeles will remember the testimony against her long after it forgets the testimony that cleared her."&lt;ref&gt;H.L. Mencken, "Two Enterprising Ladies," ''American Mercury,'' v. 13, no. 52 (April 1928) 506-508; quote on 508.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims of extramarital affairs==

===During her lifetime===
[[File:ASM-reading blackmailNote1.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|McPherson was often the target of numerous unsubstantiated sexually related allegations. As reported by the ''Los Angeles Times'', June 4, 1936, this photograph depicts the evangelist reading a note demanding $10,000, else nude motion pictures of her and a friend would be publicly released. When inquired about it in an unrelated interview later that year, she tersely stated nude pictures of her did not exist because none were ever taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corbisimages.com/stock-photo/rights-managed/U373542ACME/mcpherson-charged-for-slander?popup=1 |title=McPherson Charged for Slander - U373542ACME - Rights Managed - Stock Photo - Corbis |publisher=Corbisimages.com |date=1936-12-12 |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Numerous allegations of illicit love affairs&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; were often directed against McPherson. Suspected lovers generally denied involvement.&lt;ref name="Sutton, p. 175"&gt;Sutton, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Kenneth Ormiston, a married man with a small son,&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, pp. 264, 287&lt;/ref&gt; could have profited immensely from an exposé about himself and McPherson.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 234. Note: Kenneth Ormiston did eventually sell his story to the press, identifying his companion as Elizabeth Tovey.&lt;/ref&gt; That the two had a good working relationship and were friendly with each other was not disputed. During the 1926 kidnapping grand jury trial, reporters and investigators tried to link him amorously to McPherson.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, pp. 289, 307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p.135&lt;/ref&gt; Ormiston told newspapers his name connected in such a way to the evangelist "was a gross insult to a noble and sincere woman."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas ''Vanishing'' p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cox, pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alarmed by her rapidly changing style of dress and involvement with Hollywood and its "worldly" lifestyle, in 1929, an Angelus Temple official&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webjournals.ac.edu.au/authors/john-goben/ |title=John Goben • Webjournals |publisher=Webjournals.ac.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114014642/http://webjournals.ac.edu.au/authors/john-goben/ |archivedate=2013-11-14 |df= }}, Blumhofer, p. 311, Note: Reverend John D. Goben was a successful Midwestern evangelist when he joined the Angeles Temple in 1927. A revival campaign in 1930 by Goben led to the establishment the Stone Church in Toronto, Canada. Goben served as treasurer to the International Foursquare Gospel Lighthouses, an association of satellite churches he helped manage. Because of a dispute with McPherson and her legal counsel, over property ownership by the churches, he was ousted as treasurer. His mounting discontent along with encouragement of some of the Church board members, in part, precipitated his expensive private investigation of McPherson. One evening at a board meeting, Goben, hoping to elicit a confession in lieu of evidence he could not obtain, confronted McPherson with his surveillance. But McPherson, so shocked by what he did, fainted. The board members turned against Goben and he was fired. His bitter departure resulted in his publication of a pamphlet entitled ''Aimee, the Gospel Gold-Digger''. Aimed at Temple supporters, he detailed alleged financial irregularities. A brief grand jury investigation was started, but come to nothing.&lt;/ref&gt; hired detectives to shadow McPherson. Through her windows, the detectives frequently saw McPherson staying up until the early morning hours composing songs, drafting sacred operas, and scribbling diagrams of her illustrated sermons.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, pp. 334, 337&lt;/ref&gt; They were looking for evidence of her indiscretions, but found nothing. No confirmation of adulterous misconduct,&lt;ref name="Sutton, p. 175"/&gt; with perhaps exception of her third marriage as a violation of Church tenets, was ever presented. McPherson herself, aware of numerous accusations leveled at her throughout her career, responded only to a small fraction of them, conveying the only thing she had time for was "preaching Jesus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foursquare.org/news/article/a_lasting_legacy |title=A Lasting Legacy &amp;#124; Foursquare Legacy &amp;#124; The Foursquare Church |publisher=Foursquare.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Posthumously===
Posthumously, unsubstantiated allegations of extramarital affairs continued to emerge, this time by those who stated to have been her partner, claims not mentioned by them or others while she was still alive. Canadian journalist [[Gordon Sinclair]] implied such a claim in his 1966 autobiography, ''Will the Real Gordon Sinclair Please Stand Up.'' Sinclair stated he worked on a story with McPherson and during one of those times in 1934, the incident purportedly occurred. Sinclair alluded to a sexual dalliance with McPherson one afternoon along with some gin and ginger.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, pp. 175, 312&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty years after her death, another claim by comedian [[Milton Berle]], in a 1974 autobiography, alleges a brief affair with the evangelist. In his book, titled '' Milton Berle: An Autobiography'', Berle asserts he met McPherson at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles where both were doing a charity show. Biographer Matthew Avery Sutton commented, "Berle, a notorious womanizer whose many tales of scandalous affairs were not always true, claimed to have had sex with McPherson on this and one other occasion", both during a year when McPherson was often ill and bedridden. Sutton noted that Berle's story of a [[crucifix]]&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 241. Note: McPherson was frequently photographed with the image of the Christian Cross, which differs from the crucifix, with its hanging figure of Jesus and its common association with Catholicism. Cox states anecdotally some persons adversarial to McPherson, who heard the Berle story wanted to believe it was true, "but that bit about the crucifix" convinced them otherwise.&lt;/ref&gt; in McPherson's bedroom was not consistent with the coolness of Pentecostal-Catholic relations during that era.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Another book by Milton Berle, ''Laughingly Yours'', which had autobiographical content that was published in 1939 while McPherson was still alive, did not have this claim.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Raymond L. Cox states: "Mrs. McPherson's daughter, Roberta Salter of New York, told me, 'Mother never had an apartment in her life.' By 1931, she kept herself securely chaperoned to guard against such allegations." During 1930, the evangelist's appearances and whereabouts can be traced almost every day. She was incapacitated with illness a full five months of that year, and there is no place on her schedule as reported in her publications and church and travel records for the benefit Berle alleged. Besides, Roberta also told Cox, "Mother never did a benefit in her life. She had her own charities".&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Raymond L. The Verdict is In, 1983, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and career==

[[File:ASM-cutting cake.jpg|thumbnail|right|150px|McPherson surrounded by flowers, cutting into Angelus Temple cake, 1929. Not one for settling into a predictable routine, she used her birthday, national holidays and other events as themes for church services and gala festivities.|350px]]

===After fallout with press===
Following her heyday in the 1920s, McPherson carried on with her ministry, but fell out of favor with the press. They once dubbed her the "miracle worker"&lt;ref&gt;Blumhofer, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; or "miracle woman", reporting extensively on her faith-healing demonstrations, but now were anxious to relay every disturbance in her household to the headlines. Her developing difficulties with her mother, Mildred Kennedy, were starting to take the front page. Yet, McPherson emerged from the kidnapping nationally famous. As much as 10% of the population in Los Angeles held membership in her Temple.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Roberts Liardon, God's Generals: Vol. 7, DVD 2005&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, movie studios competed with each other offering McPherson long-term contracts.

Believing that talking pictures had the potential to transform Christianity, McPherson explored Hollywood culture and appeared in newsreels alongside other famous individuals such as [[Mary Pickford]], [[Frances Perkins]], and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. She lost weight, cut and dyed her hair, began to wear makeup and jewelry, and became stylish and well-attired, leading one critic to determine that McPherson "can out-dress the Hollywood stars". The solicitation of fame, justified to draw audiences to her and hence to Christ, was more than some in her church organization could accept. They yearned for Sister Aimee "in the old time dress," referring to her previous "trademarked" uniform of a navy cape over a white servant's dress, both purchased inexpensively in bargain basements.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, pp. 153–160&lt;/ref&gt; Other members, though, loved it, and her Angelus Temple services were as popular as ever and remained so throughout her life. Unless parishioners arrived at a service early, frequently they could not get in; all seats were taken. Now that she could afford it, McPherson thought, as well, she wanted her apparel and display to be the best she could present to Jesus.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/sister/ |title=American Experience . Sister Aimee |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1927, McPherson immediately set out on a "vindication tour", visiting various cities and taking advantage of the publicity her kidnapping story created to preach the Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;She also traveled to England, Scotland and Wales for five weeks of revival services. Press reports, depending upon the sources, described her audiences as either lacking enthusiasm or multitudes filling the altars anxiously awaiting a return visit. {{Cite news|title=Poor Aimee |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,732031,00.html?promoid=googlep |quote=Those of the nobility and gentry and middle classes who reflected upon the matter appeared to feel that the Holy Bible still offers a sufficient choice of Gospels. But of course the London mob, the lower classes, rushed to attend the evangelistic First Night of Aimee Semple McPherson |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=October 22, 1928 |accessdate=2007-08-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930045728/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C732031%2C00.html?promoid=googlep |archivedate=30 September 2007 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her visit to New York in fox-furs and a finely trimmed yellow suit was noted in the society pages. She even visited nightclubs, including a famous speakeasy in New York: [[Texas Guinan]]'s Three Hundred Club on 54th Street. While McPherson sipped water at her table, Guinan asked if she would speak a few words to the patrons. Delighted, McPherson stood and addressed the jazzed and boozy crowd:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Behind all these beautiful clothes, behind these good times, in the midst of your lovely buildings and shops and pleasures, there is another life. There is something on the other side. "What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" With all your getting and playing and good times, do not forget you have a Lord. Take Him into your hearts. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The unexpected speech that did not judge, and had a conciliatory tone between them and the Divine, earned a thoughtful moment of silence from the crowd, then an applause that went on for much longer than the speech took. The revelers were invited to hear her preach at the [[Glad tidings tabernacle|Glad Tidings Tabernacle]] on 33rd Street. The visits to speakeasies and nightclubs added to McPherson's notoriety; newspapers reported heavily on them, rumors erroneously conveyed she was drinking, smoking and dancing; and her mother along with some other church members, did not understand McPherson's strategy of tearing down barriers between the secular and religious world, between the sinner and the saved.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, pp. 318–320&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problems with Mildred Kennedy===

[[File:LAPL Lake Tahoe camp00024537.jpg|thumb|right|Without Mildred Kennedy's conservative financial management, replacement administrators embarked on a spread of ambitious projects that often failed. An example of this was Lake Tahoe lot deals of which the cover of an alleged prospectus describes. Not enough parcels of land were purchased and the subsequent lawsuit brought by investors drew unfavorable publicity and the attention of the district attorney's office.]]
In the summer of 1927, Mildred Kennedy, McPherson's mother, left the Angelus Temple. In an attempt to curtail her daughter's influence and officially transfer more power to herself, Kennedy initiated a staff-member "vote of confidence" against McPherson, but lost. The two had heatedly argued over management policies and McPherson's changing personal dress and appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; For similar reasons, 300 members of the choir left, as well. The choir could be replaced;&lt;ref&gt;Blumhofer, pp. 308, 317. Note: A month later most of the choir members returned. Their leader, Gladwyn Nichols later returned as well, after publicly apologizing to McPherson.&lt;/ref&gt; however, Kennedy's financial and administrative skills had been of crucial importance in growing McPherson's ministry from tent revivals to satellite churches and maintaining its current activities in the Temple. A series of less able management staff replaced Kennedy, and the Temple became involved in various questionable projects such as hotel building, cemetery plots, and land sales. Accordingly, the Angelus Temple plummeted deep into debt. In response to the difficulties, Kennedy came back in late 1929, but because of continued serious disagreements with McPherson, tendered her resignation on July 29, 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, McPherson suffered a physical and [[nervous breakdown]]. For 10 months, she was absent from the pulpit, diagnosed, in part, with acute [[acidosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resurrecting her career===
When she gained strength and returned, she introduced with renewed vigor her moving "Attar of Roses" sermon, based on the Song of Solomon, with its Rose of Sharon as the mystical Body of Christ. While journalists attending her Sunday illustrated sermons assumed her language was fit only for slapstick or sentimental entertainment, scholars who have studied her work for Bible students and small prayer groups, found instead the complex discourse of [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonic]] interpretation. For example, she had hundreds of pages written about the Old Testament book, the Song of Solomon, each "different from one another as snowflakes".&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 356&lt;/ref&gt;

The October 10–18, 1931, revival in [[Boston]] started out sluggishly and many predicted its failure. A Los Angeles newspaper ran headlines of the flop and expected more of the same in the days to come. On opening night, McPherson spoke to fewer than 5,000 persons in the 22,000-seat sports arena, and safety pins and rubber bands abundantly cluttered the collection baskets. The city had large populations of Unitarians, Episcopalians, and Catholics, venerable denominations traditionally hostile to a Pentecostal or fundamentalist message. Afterwards, from her hotel room, McPherson, known to be a sports fan, asked for the afternoon's World Series scores and a ''Boston Herald'' reporter sent her a copy of the Sunday edition. The next day, the "Bring Back the Bible to Boston" campaign's tone shifted as McPherson took greater control and attendance climbed sharply.&lt;ref name="Epstein, p. 368"&gt;Epstein, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CoxBoston"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/heartland/7707/boston.htm|title=Dr. Raymond L. Cox : The Greatest Nine Days|publisher=oocities.org|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reporter took note of McPherson's stage presence, different from any other evangelist who spoke there, gesturing with her white Bible for effect, as well as preaching. Answering him as to why she presented a dramatic sermon, she stated, "Our God is a dramatic God...rolling back the Red Sea...Elijah on the mountaintop...the crucifixion, the resurrection, His ascension,... tongues of fire on the day of Pentecost." The final day of afternoon and evening services had 40,000 persons attending, the stadium was full, and more than 5,000 had to be turned away. A total of 160,000 people attended the meetings, breaking historic attendance records of any nine days of revival services in Boston.&lt;ref name="CoxBoston"/&gt;

Her revival in New York City was not very fruitful, as her sensationalistic reputation preceded her. The third marriage to David Hutton, rumored romances, and her kidnapping was what its press and citizens wanted to hear about. Therefore, after a brief pause in New York and Washington, D.C., she went on to Philadelphia and other cities, traveling to 46 of them in 21 states, speaking to as much as 2% of the entire population of the United States. A full crew of musicians, scene designers, and costumers accompanied McPherson. In this, her last national revival tour, between September 1933 and December 20, 1934, two million persons heard 336 sermons. Many more were reached by 45 radio stations.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Boston Evening Traveler'' newspaper reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aimee's religion is a religion of joy. There is happiness in it. Her voice is easy to listen to. She does not appeal to the brain and try to hammer religion into the heads of her audience. Rather, she appeals to the hearts of her hearers. She radiates friendliness. She creates an atmosphere that is warming. She is persuasive, rather than forceful; gracious and kindly, rather than compelling. Fundamentally she takes the whole Bible literally, from cover to cover.&lt;ref name="CoxBoston"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, she was not a [[Biblical literalism|radical literalist]]. In an informal meeting with some Harvard students, McPherson told them that Genesis allowed great latitude of interpretation, and that neither she nor the Bible insisted the world was created only 6,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepticism.org/timeline/october-history/9302-aimee-semple-mcpherson-uninvited-speak-harvard.html |title=Today in History: 15 October 1931: Aimee Semple McPherson Uninvited to Speak at Harvard |publisher=Skepticism.org |date=1931-10-15 |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another meeting with students, she heard their assertion the teachings of Christ have outlived their usefulness; education, science and cold reasoning were the new saviors of the world. Thus compelled, McPherson decided to travel and look at the world with new eyes.&lt;ref name="GiveGod"&gt;McPherson, Aimee Semple, Give me my Own God, H. C. Kinsey &amp; Company, Inc., 1936&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, McPherson embarked on a worldwide six-month discovery tour to examine the social, religious, and economic climates of many countries. At one point, it was earlier reported she wanted to study the women's movement in connection with the campaign for the independence of India, and was anxious to have "a chat with [[Mahatma Gandhi]]".&lt;ref name="newspapers1"/&gt; She received an invitation from him and he gave her a sari made from threads woven from his simple spinning wheel. Impressed with Gandhi and his ideas, McPherson thought he might secretly lean towards Christianity, his dedication possibly coming from catching "a glimpse of the cleansing, lifting, strengthening power of the Nazarene".&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Avery Sutton, Aimee Semple McPherson and the Resurrection of Christian America (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2007), p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

Other highlights included traversing barefoot, in [[Myanmar]], the lengthy stone path to [[Shwedagon Pagoda|the Great Pagoda]], a gold-covered 325-ft tiered tower enshrining relics of four [[Buddha]]s, which caught and reflected the rays of the sun, a "vision of breath-taking glory."&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Give me my Own God, pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; She heard [[Benito Mussolini]] speak in Italy, and fretted war would again ensue. In the rain, at [[Verdun, France]], she sat on a wrecked military vehicle in mournful contemplation of the hundreds of thousands who died on the still-uncleared battlefield. White, bleached bones of the fallen poked out of the earth, and nearby, laborers toiled carefully at their dangerous [[iron harvest]], collecting old munitions for disposal.

In mid-1936, a delegation who had been involved with the 1906 [[Azusa Street Revival|Azusa Street Mission Revival]]s, including [[Emma Cotton]], asked if they could use the Angelus Temple for their 30th Anniversary Celebration. The original mission building was demolished and its land unavailable. African American Evangelist Emma Cotton and McPherson therefore organized a series of meetings which also marked her enthusiastic reidentification with the Pentecostal movement. McPherson's experiments of Hollywood celebrity ambitions coexisting with her ministry were not as successful as she hoped. Alliances with other church groups were failing or no longer in effect, and she searched for ways to start again. Therefore, she looked to her spiritual origins and allowed for the possibility of reintroducing even the more alarming aspects of the Pentecostal experience into her public meetings. Temple officials were concerned the Azusa people might bring in some "wildfire and Holy Rollerism". McPherson indicated she would turn hand springs with them as needed to see the power of God manifest.

The [[Azusa Street Revival]] commemoration events brought numbers of black leaders to her pulpit. The original attendees of the Azusa revivals filled the Angelus Temple along with every ethnic minority, "the saints who were once smelted together with the fires of Pentecost" were "being reunited, rewelded, and rejuvenated." McPherson recommitted herself to the dissemination of "classic Pentecostalism", and her concern now was that Foursquaredom was in danger of becoming too "churchy". For the first time since the Temple opened, McPherson began to publicly deliver some of her messages in tongues. McPherson traversed the line between cold formality and wildfire and now decided "it was easier to cool down a hot fanatic than to resuscitate a corpse." Future meetings to celebrate the Azusa Street Revivals included guest [[Charles Harrison Mason|Charles H. Mason]], a founder of the Churches of God in Christ. Mason, an Azusa leader, was also one of the most significant African American religious figures in United States history and was frequently hosted at the Angelus Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/heartland/7707/mcpente.htm |title=Dr. Raymond L.

[[File:ASM Semple Crawford1935.jpg|thumbnail|250px|left|McPherson's daughter, Roberta Semple (left); McPherson (middle); and Rheba Crawford Splivalo, assistant pastor of Angelus Temple (right), at a parade in 1935]]

===Problems with the Temple===
Also in 1936, McPherson reassigned staff responsibilities in an effort to address the Temple's financial difficulties. This, together with other unresolved issues, accelerated simmering tensions among various staff members. Rumors circulated that "Angel of Broadway", charismatic evangelist Rheba Crawford Splivalo, who had been working extensively with McPherson for several years, planned to take the Angelus Temple from her. McPherson asked Splivalo to "leave town".&lt;ref name="Epstein, p. 368"/&gt; In the course of the staff controversy, McPherson's lawyer issued a strongly worded press release that upset Roberta Star Semple, McPherson's daughter, and led her to initiate a $150,000&lt;ref&gt;US $2.3 million in 2012&lt;/ref&gt; lawsuit against him for slander. Splivalo also sued McPherson for $1,080,000&lt;ref&gt;US $17 million in 2012&lt;/ref&gt; because of alleged statements calling her a [[Jezebel]] and a [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] and "unfit to stand in the Angelus Temple pulpit".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''Storming'', pp. 282-284, 297 NOTE: Splivalo did earn a loyal following of disciples at the Angelus Temple, one in particular who was in contentious strife with McPherson. Splivalo gathered a list of purported damaging statements together with the witnesses, places, and times they were allegedly made by McPherson. However, the vocabulary of accused slanderous remarks, as stated in the lawsuit, were inconsistent with McPherson's known public sermons, writings, and statements.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herald-Journal&amp;nbsp;– May 11, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

The two lawsuits filed by Semple and Splivalo were not related, but McPherson did not see it that way. She saw both as part of the Temple takeover plot. McPherson's mother was also involved and sided with Semple, her granddaughter, making unflattering statements about McPherson to the press. In these charged circumstances, McPherson's defense of herself and her [[lawyer]] in a public trial was dramatic and theatrical. She testified tearfully with swoons and faints about how her daughter conspired with others against her.&lt;ref&gt;United Press, April 15, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter's lawyer, meanwhile, mocked McPherson by imitating her mannerisms and making faces at her.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, pp. 413–414&lt;/ref&gt; The trial did much to estrange McPherson from her daughter. The judge ruled for Semple, giving a $2,000&lt;ref&gt;US $31,000 in 2012&lt;/ref&gt; judgment in her favor. Semple then moved to New York. Splivalo and the Temple settled their suit [[out of court]] for the "cause of religion and the good of the community."&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;

With Kennedy, Semple, and Splivalo gone, the Temple lost much of its talented leadership. However, McPherson found a competent and firm administrator in Giles Knight, who was able to bring the Temple out of debt, dispose of the 40 or so lawsuits, and eliminate the more spurious projects. He sequestered McPherson, allowed her to receive only a few personal visitors, and carefully regulated her activities outside the Temple. This period was one of unprecedented creativity for McPherson. No longer distracted by waves of reporters, reams of lawsuits, and innumerable individuals demanding her attention, she became very accomplished in her illustrative sermon style of Gospel preaching. The irreligious [[Charlie Chaplin]] would secretly attend her services, enjoying her sermons. She later met and consulted with Chaplin on ways to improve her presentations. McPherson, who earlier blared across newspaper headlines as many as three times a week, in one alleged scandal or another, had her public image much improved. Her adversary, Reverend Robert P. Shuler, who previously attacked her by radio, magazine, pulpit, and pamphlet, proclaimed "Aimee's missionary work was the envy of Methodists".&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 427&lt;/ref&gt; He also expressed his support of her Foursquare Church application admittance into National Association of Evangelicals for United Action in 1943.&lt;ref name="SuttonWildfire"/&gt;

Her efforts at making interracial revival a reality at Angelus Temple continued. She welcomed blacks into the congregation and pulpit. While race riots burned [[Detroit]] in 1943, McPherson publicly converted the notorious black former [[heavyweight]] champion [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] on the Temple stage and embraced him "as he raised his hand in worship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Updike |first=John |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/04/30/070430crbo_books_updike |title=Famous Aimee |publisher=The New Yorker |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674032538 |title=Aimee Semple McPherson and the Resurrection of Christian America — Matthew Avery Sutton &amp;#124; Harvard University Press |publisher=Hup.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==War years==

===Views on war===
[[Pacifism]], which was a component of Pentecostalism, was evaluated by the Foursquare Gospel Church in the 1930s with official statements and documents which were further revised by McPherson. A press quote attributed to McPherson, in reference to Mahatma Gandhi, appears to explore the concept, "I want to incorporate the ideals of India with my own...."&lt;ref name="newspapers1"/&gt; Additionally, Clinton Howard, the chairman of the World Peace Commission, was invited to speak at the Angelus Temple. In 1932, she promoted disarmament, "If the nations of the world would stop building warships and equipping armies[,] we would be all but overwhelmed with prosperity."&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

Foursquare leaders, alarmed at rapid changes of technology, especially sea and air, which challenged the United States' isolation and security, decided to officially draw up an amendment inclusive of varied opinions in regards to military service. The idea that one could trust to bear arms in a righteous cause, as well as believing the killing of others, even in connection to military service, would endanger their souls; both views were acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, pp. 256–257&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction to war===
McPherson kept a canny eye on the international events leading up to the Second World War, citing the probability of a much more terrible conflict than the one that passed 20 years earlier. In a sermon, she described a recently conquered country which had the Cross and other religious symbols in their schools removed; in their place was a portrait of a certain man. Instead of prayer, their school day began with a distinctive salute to this person. The destructive [[apocalypse]] of [[John the Apostle]], with its expected high civilian casualties, followed by the Second Coming of Christ, it seemed, was at hand. Even if submarines were hiding in the depths of the sea, they could not escape the terror that would befall them.&lt;ref&gt;Aimee Semple McPherson Audio Tapes, Zero Hour Sermon, http://www2.wheaton.edu/bgc/archives/GUIDES/103.htm#602&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ASM 14hourService 1.jpg|thumbnail|left|300px|Congregation at Angelus Temple during fourteen-hour Holy Ghost service led by Aimee Semple McPherson, Los Angeles, Calif., 1942]]
All-night prayer meetings were held Friday nights at the Angelus Temple, starting in 1940, the year when [[Germany]] was overrunning [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[France]]. She asked other Foursquare churches around the country to follow suit. She sent President Franklin Roosevelt's secretary, Mr. [[Stephen Early]], as well as some other leaders, an outline of her plans. Prayer, to her, was even more powerful than the implements of war. Various officials expressed their appreciation, including the governor of California.&lt;ref name="foursquare.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foursquare.org/news/article/world_war_ii_and_angelus_temple |title=World War II and Angelus Temple &amp;#124; Foursquare Legacy &amp;#124; The Foursquare Church |publisher=Foursquare.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early passed on a reply back from Roosevelt: a message of thanks for her work. A month later, Roosevelt declared a [[National Day of Prayer]] to "beseech the Ruler of the Universe to bless our Republic." Foursquare leaders thought McPherson may have inspired it, and perhaps the President of the United States was looking to her for spiritual leadership of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outbreak of [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], McPherson rejected the Christian pacifism of many in the Pentecostal movement, including those of her own church. Her mind was set on doing what ever it took to assist the United States in winning the war, "It is the Bible against ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. It is the [[Christian cross|Cross]] against the [[Swastika]]. It is God against the [[antichrist]] of [[Japan]]...This is no time for pacifism."&lt;ref&gt;Aimee Semple McPherson, "Foursquaredom and Uncle Sam," Foursquare Crusader, 14 (February 1942) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The Angelus Temple itself became a visible symbol of home front sacrifice for the war effort. If necessary, it was announced, the building could be used for an air raid shelter. The distinctive white dome was painted over with black paint and its beautiful stained-glass windows were covered up. The Temple, like other buildings in the city, had to have any opening or window that could emit visible light at night, covered. One evening in May 1942, to advertise the need to conserve gasoline and rubber, McPherson herself drove a horse and buggy to the Angelus Temple.&lt;ref name="foursquare.org"/&gt;

[[Rubber]] and other [[Drive (charity)|drives]] were organized, and unlimited airtime on her radio station, KFSG, was given to the [[Office of War Information]]. She asked parishioners and other listeners to donate two hours a day for such tasks as rolling bandages "so that a soldier's bandage could be changed.... And let us give our blood to help every one." Money was raised to provide local military bases with comfortable furnishings and radios. ''Newsweek'' published an article about McPherson, "The World's Greatest Living Minister", on July 19, 1943, noting she had collected 2,800 pints of blood for the Red Cross; servicemen in her audience are especially honored, and the climax of her church services is when she reads the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|National Anthem]].&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, pp. 264, 333&lt;/ref&gt;

McPherson gave visiting servicemen autographed Bibles. She observed they often had no religious affiliation and did not even own a Bible. She wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What a privilege it was to invite the servicemen present in every Sunday night meeting to come to the platform, where I greeted them, gave each one a New Testament, and knelt in prayer with them for their spiritual needs, and God's guidance and protection on their lives. Later, when the altar call would be given, many of these same servicemen would make another trip to the platform publicly to receive Jesus Christ as their personal savior.&lt;ref name="foursquare.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She insulted [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Hideki Tōjō]], and became involved in [[war bond]] rallies. Pershing Square's Victory House in Los Angeles never saw a bigger crowd. McPherson sold $150,000&lt;ref&gt;Note: A P47 Thunderbolt fighter was then priced about $85,000, P51 Mustang $50,000, M4 Sherman tank $50,000, B17 Flying Fortress $240,00&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panzerworld.net/prices.html |title=Product Prices |publisher=Panzerworld.net |date=2013-10-22 |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2total.com/WW2/Weapons/Vehicles/Tanks/US/Sherman-tank/Sherman-tank-76mm.htm |title=Sherman tank - improved M4 models with 76mm gun, protection |publisher=Ww2total.com |date=1945-04-26 |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US 2 million dollars in 2012&lt;/ref&gt; worth of bonds in one hour on June 20, 1942, breaking all previous records, then repeated the performance again on July 4, 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Blumhofer, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Treasury]] awarded her a special citation. The Army made McPherson an honorary colonel.

Her wartime activities included sermons that linked the church and American patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Matthew. [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674032538 Aimee Semple McPherson and the Resurrection of Christian America], London: [[Harvard University Press]], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; McPherson spoke to the men in uniform of her belief that military action against the Axis powers was long overdue. And more so than in almost any war previously, she felt that if they did not prevail, churches, homes, and everything precious and dear to the Christian would absolutely be destroyed.&lt;ref name="Sutton, p. 263"&gt;Sutton, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

McPherson's embrace of the [[total war]] strategy of the United States left her open to some criticism. The line between the church as an independent moral authority monitoring government became blurred, perceived instead, as complicit with that same governance. Wrongs being done to Japanese Americans through their internment in relocation camps were being overlooked, for example. And she refused to allow her denomination to support Christians who remained committed pacifists. Even if conscientious objectors were willing to participate in noncombat roles, more was needed. Church members and leaders had to be willing to take up arms and fight for the United States. The pacifist clause which earlier existed was, by her proposal, voted upon and eliminated by Foursquare Gospel Church leaders.&lt;ref name="Sutton, p. 263"/&gt;

==Death==

[[File:Aimee Semple McPherson grave at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, California.JPG|thumb|270px|McPherson's grave]]
On September 26, 1944, McPherson went to [[Oakland, California]], for a series of revivals, planning to preach her popular "Story of My Life" sermon. When McPherson's son went to her hotel room at 10:00 the next morning, he found her unconscious with pills and a half-empty bottle of capsules nearby. She was dead by 11:15. It was later discovered she previously called her doctor that morning to complain about feeling ill from the medicine, but he was in surgery and could not be disturbed. She then phoned another doctor who referred her to yet another physician. However, McPherson apparently lost consciousness before the third could be contacted.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 438&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Judith ''Working Miracles The Drama and Passion of Aimee Semple McPherson'' (James Lorimer &amp; Company Ltd., Publishers, Toronto, 2008) p.104-105&lt;/ref&gt;

The autopsy did not conclusively determine the cause of McPherson's death. She had been taking sleeping pills following numerous health problems&amp;nbsp;– including "tropical fever". Among the pills found in the hotel room was the barbiturate [[Seconal]], a strong sedative which had not been prescribed for her. It was unknown how she obtained them.

The coroner said she most likely died of an accidental overdose compounded by kidney failure. The cause of death is officially listed as unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Note: In the 1993 obituary for her daughter-in-law, McPherson's life and death are mentioned. {{Cite news |title= Lorna McPherson, 82, Of the Angelus Temple. |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEEDF1738F93BA25755C0A965958260 |quote= Aimee Semple McPherson founded Angelus Temple in the early 1920s, when her brand of fundamentalist Christianity, stressing the "born-again" experience, divine healing and evangelism, was popular in the United States.

Forty-five thousand people waited in long lines, some until 2 am, to file past the evangelist, where, for three days, her body lay in state at the Angelus Temple. Within a mile-and-a-half (800 m) radius of the church, police had to double park cars. It later took 11 trucks to transport the $50,000&lt;ref&gt;$630,000 in 2012 dollars&lt;/ref&gt; worth of flowers to the cemetery which itself received more telegrammed floral orders than at any time since [[Will Rogers]]' death almost 10 years earlier. A Foursquare leader noted that to watch the long line pass reverently by her casket, and see tears shed by all types of people, regardless of class and color, helped give understanding to the far-reaching influence of her life and ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

An observer, Marcus Bach, who was on a spiritual odyssey of personal discovery, wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Roberta, who had married an orchestra director, flew in from New York. Ma Kennedy was at the grave, Rheba Crawford Splivalo had returned to say that there was never a greater worker for God than Sister. A thousand ministers of the Foursquare Gospel paid their tearful tribute. The curious stood by impressed. The poor who had always been fed at Angelus were there, the lost who had been spirit-filled, the healed, the faithful here they were eager to immortalize the Ontario farm girl who loved the Lord. Here they laid the body of Sister Aimee to rest in the marble sarcophagus guarded by two great angels on Sunrise slope.&lt;ref name="foundfaith"&gt;Bach, Marcus, They Have Found a Faith, (The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Indianapolis / New York, 1946) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Millions of dollars passed through McPherson's hands. However, when her personal estate was calculated, it amounted to $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;about $130,000 in 2013&lt;/ref&gt; To her daughter, Roberta, went $2000&lt;ref&gt;about $26,000 in 2013 dollars&lt;/ref&gt; the remainder to her son Rolf. By contrast, her mother Mildred Kennedy had a 1927 severance settlement of as much as $200,000&lt;ref&gt;about $2.5 million in 2013 dollars&lt;/ref&gt; in cash and property; the Foursquare Church itself was worth $2.8 million&lt;ref&gt;about US$36 million in 2013 dollars&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 440&lt;/ref&gt;

McPherson is buried in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Glendale, California]]. Following her death, the Foursquare Gospel church denomination was led for 44 years by her son [[Rolf McPherson]]. The church claims a membership of over 7.9 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foursquare.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and influence==

===Ministry===
McPherson's ministry continued to flourish even in the face of scandal. The newspapers which served to propel McPherson to fame and advertise her message, also were used to highlight her faults, real and imagined. Some modern televangelists who transgressed and faded into obscurity because of high-profile news coverage, also learned how quickly modern communication media could hurt as well as help them. After her death, the largely negative aspect of her media image persisted, was cultivated&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 3. Note: as one example Cox lists, a reporter for The Los Angeles Times, Dial Torgerson, May 18, 1969; writes in his ''Aimee's Disappearance Remains a Mystery,'' story, that HC Benedict, owner of the Carmel cottage, was expected to be a witness against McPherson, but died apparently of heart trouble before he could testify. Cox notes that HC Benedict did indeed testify, but on her behalf, denying vehemently the woman with Ormiston was McPherson. HC Benedict died on November 20, 1926, some weeks after all testimony had been concluded.&lt;/ref&gt; and became the dominant factor in defining McPherson for many in the public today.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverend [[Robert P. Shuler]], whose caustic view of McPherson softened over the years, wrote he could not figure out why God chose such a person. The flaws he observed in McPherson, were by his opinion, many, yet she ultimately made a positive impact on Christianity, long lasting and enduring. He recognized her appeal was a combination of identifying with the average citizen as well as an ability to explain the gospel in simple, easily understandable terms, drawing them irresistibly to her services:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...while great cathedral churches closed their doors on Sunday night, the crowds pushed through her portals in one ever-flowing stream.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He saw her legacy extend far beyond the glamor of Hollywood, exerting itself through the thousands of ministers she trained and churches planted throughout the world. McPherson, together with the alliances she made, worked to reshape the evangelical Christian faith, making it relevant to American culture and personally involving for those in the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
[[File:Uldine Utley.png|thumb|200px|[[Uldine Utley]], c. 1924]]
In [[Fresno]], California, 1921, nine-year-old [[Uldine Utley]] (1912–1995) soon became a Christian revivalist after hearing McPherson's dramatic retelling of the David and [[Goliath]] story. With her parents as managers, using the same metaphors as McPherson, referring to Christ as "the Rose of Sharon" and invoking "Bride of Christ" imagery, she went on to preach to millions of people,&lt;ref&gt;George Hunston Williams, Rodney Lawrence Petersen, Calvin Augustine Pater, The Contentious Triangle: Church, State, and University, Truman State University Press, 1999, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blumhofer, pp.182&lt;/ref&gt; the most notable of whom was [[John Sung]], a Chinese scientist who attended one of Utley's meetings and became so inspired that he went back to [[China]], an early mission field for McPherson, and introduced millions to the Christian message. Sung became alternately known as the "Billy Graham" or the "John Wesley" of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.ochristian.com/article2573.shtml|author=[[Timothy Tow]] |title=John Sung and the Asian Awakening |publisher=Articles.ochristian.com |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="towel.mysitehosted.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://towel.mysitehosted.com/~awakeand//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=43 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114015721/http://towel.mysitehosted.com/~awakeand//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=43 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-11-14 |title=Awake and Go!

According to biographer Matthew Avery Sutton, in the early 1900s, it was expected that traditional Protestantism would give way to rapidly developing new philosophical ideas and sciences that were being widely taught. McPherson contributed immensely to the forestalling of that predicted inevitability. [[Liberal Christianity]], which enjoyed strong growth starting in the late 19th century, regarded many of the miracles of Jesus to be superstitious interpretations of what actually occurred or metaphors for his teachings. McPherson's faith-healing demonstrations instead gave credence to onlookers that her claim was true: Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. This Bible verse of Hebrews 13:8; as biographer Daniel Mark Epstein noted as per McPherson, meant Jesus still had power and could heal as in ancient times, and the verse become the motto of her [[International Church of the Foursquare Gospel|Foursquare Gospel Church]]. Sutton wrote that it was easy for many people to deny a God who did something 1,900 years ago, but large crowds of people were now witness to the blind seeing, the lame walking, and the deaf hearing. Healings at her services, according to Epstein from period news sources, were occurring faster than the journalists could write them down. Crowds clamored to reach her altar to experience a New Testament conversion that transformed many of their lives. Even large portions of the secular public admired her. The old time Gospel message was being dramatically marketed by the most technologically advanced means possible, reconstructing it into something far more interesting and desirable than it was previously.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, pp. 277–280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, pp. 108, 229–231&lt;/ref&gt;

McPherson's [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] approach assisted Pentecostals in learning how better to explain their faith in the context of [[Protestantism|historic church doctrine]]. Mainline churches became exposed to the more unusual [[Spiritual gift|gifts of the Holy Spirit]]. They also benefited by borrowing Pentecostal revival techniques&lt;ref name="SuttonWildfire"/&gt; such as more emotive expression, joyful praise worship, and testimonials, forerunning the [[Charismatic Movement]].

McPherson challenged what was expected from women. Females as preachers and her status as a divorcee with two failed marriages were of particular concern to many of the fundamentalist churches with which she wanted to work, but her success could not be easily ignored. Meanwhile, secular society broadly labeled women as either Victorian ladies or whores,&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; and she bounced from one category to the other. She had her extensive relief charities and along with it, titillating scandals. Atheist [[Charles Lee Smith]] remarked publicly of McPherson, just before a debate, that she had an extraordinary mind, "particularly for a woman".&lt;ref&gt;''There is a God: Debate between Aimee Semple McPherson, Fundamentalist and Charles Lee Smith, Atheist'' (Foursquare Publications, 1100 Glendale BLVD Los Angeles. CA), 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

Her continual work at church alliance-building finally bore fruit in an official way, though she did not live to see it. Foursquare Gospel Church leaders were at last able to join the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] in 1952 and from there helped organize the [[Pentecostal World Fellowship]],&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, pp. 275–276&lt;/ref&gt; which exists to the present day. Pentecostalism which once advocated separatism and was on the fringes of Protestantism, became part of mainstream Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

The map does not imply that the Albanian language is the majority or the only spoken language in these areas.]]

The [[Albanian language]] is composed of many [[dialect]]s, divided into two major groups: [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]] and [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]].&lt;ref&gt;Gjinari{{Page needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Shkumbin]] river is roughly the geographical dividing line, with Gheg spoken north of the Shkumbin and Tosk south of it.&lt;ref&gt;
Brown and Ogilvie (2008), p. 23.
''The river Shkumbin in central Albania historically forms the boundary between those two dialects, with the population on the north speaking varieties of Geg and the population on the south varieties of Tosk.''
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical considerations ==

The characteristics of the Albanian dialects Tosk and Gheg,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|Ogilvie|2008|p=23}}: "In Tosk /a/ before a nasal has become a central vowel (shwa), and intervocalic /n/ has become /r/. These two sound changes have affected only the pre-Slav stratum of the Albanian lexicon, that is the native words and loanwords from Greek and Latin"&lt;/ref&gt;
in the treatment of the native and loanwords from other languages, have led to the conclusion that the dialectal split preceded the [[Slavic migration to the Balkans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fortson|2010|p=392}}: "The dialectal split into Gheg and Tosk happened sometime after the region become Christianized in the fourth century AD; Christian Latin loanwords show Tosk rhotacism, such as Tosk murgu "monk" (Geg mungu) from Lat. monachus."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=9}}: "The Greek and Latin loans have undergone most of the far-reaching phonological changes which have so altered the shape of inherited words while Slavic and Turkish words do not show those changes. Thus Albanian must have acquired much of its present form by the time Slavs entered into Balkans in the fifth and sixth centuries AD"&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to the view of Demiraj, during the process of dialect split Albanian populations were roughly in their present location&lt;ref&gt;
[[Shaban Demiraj|Demiraj, Shaban]]. Prejardhja e shqiptarëve në dritën e dëshmive të gjuhës shqipe.(Origin of Albanians through the testimonies of the Albanian language) Shkenca (Tirane) 1999
&lt;/ref&gt;, while [[Eric Hamp]] notes that "it must be relatively old, that is, dating back into the post-Roman first millennium. As a guess, it seems possible that this isogloss reflects a spread of the speech area, after the settlement of the Albanians in roughly their present location, so that the speech area straddled the [[Jireček Line]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamp|1963|p=98}}:
''The isogloss is clear in all dialects I have studied, which embrace nearly all types possible. It must be relatively old, that is, dating back into the post-Roman first millennium. As a guess, it seems possible that this isogloss reflects a spread of the speech area, after the settlement of the Albanians in roughly their present location, so that the speech area straddled the Jireček Line.''
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gheg dialects ==
{{main|Gheg Albanian}}

Gheg is divided into four sub-dialects: Northwest Gheg, Northeast Gheg, Central Gheg, and Southern Gheg. Northwest Gheg is spoken throughout [[Montenegro]], northwestern [[Kosovo]] (west of [[Peć]]), [[Lezhë]], northwestern [[Mirditë]], [[Pukë]], and [[Shkodër]].  Northeast Gheg is spoken throughout most of Kosovo, [[Preševo]], Has, northeastern Mirditë, [[Kukës]], [[Tropojë]], and northern Tetovo. Central Gheg is spoken in [[Debar]], [[Gostivar]], [[Krujë]], [[Peshkopi]], southern Mirditë, [[Mat, Albania|Mat]], eastern [[Struga]], [[Kumanovo]], and southern [[Tetovo]].  Southern Gheg is spoken in [[Durrës]], northern [[Elbasan]], northern [[Peqin]], [[Kavajë]], northwest [[Struga]], and [[Tirana]]. One fairly divergent dialect is the [[Upper Reka Albanian dialect|Upper Reka dialect]], which is however classified as Central Gheg. There is also a diaspora dialect in [[Croatia]], the [[Arbanasi dialect]]. 

=== Gheg features ===

*No [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]]: [[Proto-Albanian]] ''*-n-'' remains ''-n-'' (e.g. ''râna'' "sand").
*Proto-Albanian ''*ō'' becomes ''vo''.
*[[Nasal vowel]]s: Gheg retains the nasal vowels of late Proto-Albanian and the late Proto-Albanian ''*â'' plus a nasal remains ''â'' (e.g. ''nândë'' "nine"). Although, the quality of the vowel varies by dialect, {{IPA|[ɑ̃]}}, {{IPA|[ɒ̃]}}, {{IPA|[ɔ̃]}}, etc. Some Northeast and Northwest Gheg dialects preserve the nasal in words such as {{IPA|[pɛ̃s]}} "five" while other Gheg dialects do not, {{IPA|[pɛs]}} "five".
*[[Monophthongization]]: Occurs in some dialects of Shkodër in a few words, e.g. {{IPA|[vø̞ː]}} ''voe'' "egg" and {{IPA|[hɛ̞ː]}} ''hae'' "food".
*Phonological vowel length:  There is often phonological vowel length in most Gheg dialects. Some dialects of Shkodër have a three length distinction in vowels, for example, short: {{IPA|[pɛ̃nˠ]}} "yoke", long: {{IPA|[pɛ̃ːnˠ]}} "pen", and extra-long: {{IPA|[pɛ̃ːːnˠ]}} "yokes".
*a-vowel: In some dialects occurring in some certain words ''a'' may become a diphthong (e.g. {{IPA|[bəaɫ]}} for ''ballë'' "forehead") or become {{IPA|[æ]}} (e.g. {{IPA|[læɾɡ]}} for ''larg'' "far").
*ë-vowel: Final -ë drops and often lengthens the preceding vowel.
*i-vowel: The ''i'' vowel in the word ''dhi'' (goat) can be realized as various vowels in the Central Gheg dialects: {{IPA|[ðəi]}} (Krujë), {{IPA|[ðei]}} (Mountainous Krujë), {{IPA|[ðɛi]}} or {{IPA|[ðei]}} (Mat), as well as {{IPA|[ðai]}} or {{IPA|[ðɔi]}} in other regions.
*o-vowel: The ''o'' derounds to {{IPA|[ʌ]}} in some words in some dialects (e.g. {{IPA|[sʌt]}} for ''sot'' "today" in Krujë and among some Muslim speakers in Shkodër).
*u-vowel: The ''u'' vowel in different dialects occurring some words may vary, for example ''rrush'' "grape" may be {{IPA|[ruʃ]}}, {{IPA|[rauʃ]}}, {{IPA|[rɔuʃ]}}, {{IPA|[rɔʃ]}}, or {{IPA|[roʃ]}}.
*y-vowel: The ''y'' vowel can remain as ''y'' (e.g. ''dy'' "two" in much of the Gheg speaking areas), derounded to ''i'' (e.g. {{IPA|[di]}} "two" in Debar), or becomes more open and less rounded to {{IPA|[ʏ̜]}} (e.g. {{IPA|[dʏ̜]}} "two" in Mat and Mountainous Krujë).  In other words in Central Gheg, the ''y'' vowel can become {{IPA|[ø]}} as in {{IPA|[sø]}} for ''sy'' "eye" (Mat and Krujë).
*bj/pj: These may yield ''bgj'' or ''pq'' in some dialects (e.g. ''pqeshkë'' for ''pjeshkë'' "peach" in Negotin).
*bl/pl/fl: These may become bj/pj/fj or even bgj/pq in some dialects (e.g. ''pjak'' for ''plak'' "old" in Toplica or ''pqak'' for ''plak'' "old" in Negotin).
*dh and ll: These sounds may interchange in some words in some dialects.
*h: This may drop in any position in some dialects.
*mb/nd:  Consonant clusters such as ''nd'' vary greatly by sub-dialect: ''nder'' "honor" can realized as {{IPA|[ndɛɾ]}}, {{IPA|[nd͉ɛɾ]}}, {{IPA|[ⁿdɛɾ]}}, {{IPA|[dɛɾ]}}, {{IPA|[nɛɾ]}}, or {{IPA|[nˠɛɾ]}}.
*q/gj: In the Gheg dialects, ''q'' and ''gj'' may remain palatal stops {{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[ɟ]}}, change to postalveolar affricates {{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}} and {{IPA|[d͡ʒ]}} (and thus merging with Albanian ''ç'' and ''xh''),  change to alveolo-palatal affricates {{IPA|[t͡ɕ]}} and {{IPA|[d͡ʑ]}}, or even change to alveolo-palatal fricatives {{IPA|[ɕ]}} and {{IPA|[ʑ]}}.
*tj/dj: These may become palatal stops {{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[ɟ]}} in some dialects.

== Transitional dialects ==
The transitional dialects are spoken in southern Elbasan (Cërrik, Dumre, Dushk, Papër, Polis, Qafe, Shpat, Sulovë, Thanë), southern Peqin, northwestern Gramsh, extreme southern Kavajë, northern and central Lushnjë, and southern Librazhd (Bërzeshtë, Rrajcë),and Flazian-Falazdim-whish spoken in north of Albania.

=== Transitional features ===
*Rhotacism: Proto-Albanian *-n- becomes -r- (e.g. râra "sand").
*Proto-Albanian *ō becomes ''vo'' in the western sub-dialects or ''va'' in the central and eastern sub-dialects.
*Nasal vowels: In some sub-dialects of Transitional, some nasal vowels denasalize (e.g. rora "sand" in Sulovë) while in other words the nasals are retained: ''sŷ'' "eye" (Dumre, Shpat, Sulovë).
*ô-vowel: Some sub-dialects have ''ô'' for ''â'' in some words (e.g. ''ôma'' "taste" in Sulovë).
*Mb/Nd: Clusters such as ''mb'' become ''m'' in some dialects (e.g. ''koma'' for standard ''këmba'' "leg").

==Tosk dialects==
{{main|Tosk Albanian}}

Tosk is divided into five sub-dialects: Northern Tosk, Labërisht, Çam, Arvanitika, and Arbëresh.  Northern Tosk is spoken in Berat, Fier, extreme southeastern Elbasan, most of Gramsh, Kolonjë, Korçë, Ohër, Përmet, east of the Vjosë river of Tepelenë, southern Struga (western shore of Lake Ohër), Pogradec, Prespa and northern Vlorë. [[Lab Albanian dialect|Lab]] ((or ''Labërisht'') is spoken in southern Vlorë, Dukat, Himarë, Mallakastër, Delvinë, west of the Vjosë river of Tepelenë, Gjirokastër and Sarandë. [[Cham Albanian dialect|Çam]] is spoken in southern Sarandë (Konispol, Ksamil{{cn|date=July 2017}}, Markat, Xarrë) and in parts of northern Greece. Tosk dialects are spoken by most members of the large Albanian immigrant communities of [[Egypt]], Turkey, and [[Ukraine]]. Çamërisht is spoken in North-western Greece, while [[Arvanitika language|Arvanitika]] is spoken by the [[Arvanites]] in southern Greece, mainly [[Peloponnese]], [[Attica]], [[Euboea]], and the adjacent islands. [[Arbëresh language|Arbëresh]] is spoken by the [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]], descendants of 15th and 16th century migrants who settled in southeastern Italy, in small communities in the regions of [[Sicily]], [[Calabria]], [[Basilicata]], [[Campania]], [[Molise]], [[Abruzzi]], and [[Apulia]]. 

===Tosk features===

*Rhotacism: Proto-Albanian ''*-n-'' becomes ''-r-'' (e.g. ''rëra'' "sand")
*Proto-Albanian ''*ō'' becomes ''va''.
*Nasal vowels: There is a lack of nasal vowels in Tosk (e.g. ''sy'' "eye") and Late Proto-Albanian ''*â'' plus a nasal becomes ''ë'' (e.g. ''nëntë'' "nine"). However, nasal vowels have been reported in the Lab dialects of Himarë and Kurvelesh &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paçarizi|2008|pp=101-102}}: "Second difference is the existence of nasal vocals in Gheg which is not a characteristic of Tosk even sometimes the nasality is not really stressed. This nasal-oral feature, according to Desnickaja, forms one of the elements which differentiate the Albanian dialects whereas Gjinari cites Dilo Sheper who said that there are also some nasal vocals in some places of Eastern Albania such as in Kurvelesh and Himarë but the information at that time did not confirmed that".&lt;/ref&gt; and separately in the Lab dialect of [[Borsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Totoni|1964|p=136}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*e-vowel: The ''e'' becomes ''ë'' in some dialects in some words ''qën'' for ''qen'' "dog" in Vjosë.
*ë-vowel: The ''ë'' may have several pronunciations depending on dialect: ''mëz'' "foal" is {{IPA|[mʌz]}} in Vuno) while ''ë'' is more backed in Labërisht.  Final -ë drops in many Tosk dialects and lengthens the preceding vowel.
*y-vowel: The ''y'' vowel often derounds to ''i'' in the southern dialects Labërisht, Çam, Arvanitika and Arbëresh (e.g. ''dy'' "two" becomes ''di'').
*Dh and Ll: These sounds may interchange in some words in some dialects.
*H: This may drop in any position in some dialects.
*Gl/Kl: Some dialects such as Çam, Arberësh, and Arvanitika retain archaic ''kl'' and ''gl'' in place of ''q'' and ''gj'', to which they have shifted in other places (e.g. ''gjuhë'' "tongue" is ''gluhë'' in Çam, ''gluhë'' in Arberësh, and  ''gljuhë'' in Arvanitika; "klumësh" for "qumësht" "milk" in Arbëresh).
*Rr: ''Rr'' becomes ''r'' in some dialects.

[[Image:Hawaii petroglyph men.jpg|thumb|[[Petroglyphs]] at [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]]]]

'''Ancient Hawai{{okina}}i''' is the period of [[Hawaii]]an human history preceding the unification in 1810 of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]] by [[Kamehameha the Great]]. Researchers had based their estimates of first settlement by Polynesian long-distance navigators from French Polynesia, [[Tahiti]], the [[Tuamotus]] and the [[Samoa|Samoan]] Islands sporadically between 300 and 800. In 2010, a study was published based on radiocarbon dating of more reliable samples and it suggests that the islands were settled much later, within a short timeframe, in c. 1219–1266.&lt;ref name="fast"/&gt;

The islands in Eastern Polynesia have been characterized by the continuities among their cultures, and the short migration period would be an explanation of this result. Diversified [[agroforestry]] and [[aquaculture]] provided sustenance for [[Native Hawaiian cuisine]]. Tropical materials were adopted for housing. Elaborate temples (called ''[[heiau]]'') were constructed from the lava rocks available.

The rich natural resources supported a relatively dense population, organized by a ruling class and social system with religious leaders. [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[James Cook]] made the first known European contact with ancient Hawaiians in 1778. He was followed by many other Europeans and Americans.

There have been changing views about initial Polynesian discovery and settlement of Hawai'i.&lt;ref name="PearcePearce2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles E.M. Pearce|author2=F. M. Pearce|title=Oceanic Migration: Paths, Sequence, Timing and Range of Prehistoric Migration in the Pacific and Indian Oceans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rhQxc4GW8soC&amp;pg=PA167|date=17 June 2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-90-481-3826-5|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radiocarbon dating in Hawai'i]] initially indicated a possible settlement as early as 124 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Emory, K.P., W.J.

Other theories suggest dating as late as 700 to 800.&lt;ref name="PearcePearce2010"/&gt; 
 
In 2010 researchers announced new findings using revised, high-precision radiocarbon dating based on more reliable samples than were previously used in many dating studies.&lt;ref name="Berkeley"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maclay|first1=Kathleen|title=Coral tests show fast construction pace for Polynesian temples|url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2010/07/08/polynesiantemples/|accessdate=2 April 2016|agency=Berkeley News|publisher=UC Berkeley|date=July 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new data indicates that the period of eastern and northern Polynesian colonization took place much later, in a shorter time frame of two waves: the "earliest in the Society Islands c. 1025 – 1120, four centuries later than previously assumed; then after 70–265 y, dispersal continued in one major pulse to all remaining islands c. 1190 – 1290."&lt;ref name="fast"&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/108/5/1815.full Janet M. Wilmshurst, Terry L. Hunt, Carl P. Lipo, and Atholl J. Anderson.

According to Hawaiian mythology, there were other settlers in Hawai{{okina}}i, peoples who were forced back into remote valleys by newer arrivals. They claim that stories about ''[[menehune]]'', little people who built ''[[heiau]]'' and fishponds, prove the existence of ancient peoples who settled the islands before the Hawaiians.&lt;ref&gt;The best survey of these stories, all collected in the latter part of the 19th century, is found in Beckwith's ''Hawaiian mythology'', pp. 321–336.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settlement==
The colonists brought along with them clothing, plants (called "[[canoe plants]]") and livestock and established settlements along the coasts and larger valleys. Upon their arrival, the settlers grew {{lang|haw|kalo}} ([[taro]]), {{lang|haw|mai{{okina}}a}} ([[banana]]), {{lang|haw|niu}} ([[coconut]]), {{lang|haw|ulu}} ([[breadfruit]]), and raised {{lang|haw|pua{{okina}}a}} ([[pork]]), {{lang|haw|moa}} ([[chicken]]), and {{lang|haw|ʻīlio}} ([[Hawaiian Poi Dog|poi dog]]), although these meats were eaten less often than fruits, vegetables, and seafood.  Popular condiments included {{lang|haw|pa{{okina}}akai}} ([[salt]]), ground [[Aleurites moluccanus|kukui nut]], {{lang|haw|[[limu (algae)|limu]]}} ([[seaweed]]), and {{lang|haw|ko}} ([[sugarcane]]) which was used as both a sweet and a medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, 2006, pp. 90–92&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the foods they brought, the settlers also acquired {{lang|haw|{{okina}}uala}} ([[sweet potato]]), The sweet potato is native to South America. Recently, an analysis of the DNA of 1,245 sweet potato varieties from Asia and the Americas was done. Researchers have found a genetic link that proves the root made it to Polynesia from the Andes around 1100 AD. The findings, published in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'', offer more evidence that ancient Polynesians may have interacted with people in South America long before the Europeans set foot on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Denham |first=Tim |title=Ancient and historic dispersals of sweet potato in Oceania" |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]] |date=February 5, 2013 |volume=110 |issue=6 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1221569110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/01/22/169980441/By%20analyzing%20the%20DNA%20of%201,245%20sweet%20potato%20varieties%20from%20Asia%20and%20the%20Americas,%20geneticists%20have%20mapped%20out%20how%20the%20root%20vegetable%20spread%20to%20Polynesia%20from%20South%20America%20at%20least%20300%20years%20before%20Inca%20gold%20was%20a%20twinkle%20in%20Ferdinand%20and%20Isabel's%20eyes.

The [[Polynesian rat|Pacific rat]] accompanied humans on their journey to Hawaiʻi.  David Burney argues that humans, along with the vertebrate animals they brought with them (pigs, dogs, chickens and rats), caused many native species of birds, plants and large land snails to become extinct in the process of colonization.&lt;ref&gt;Burney, Back to the Future in the Caves of Kaua'i. pp. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Estuaries]] and streams were adapted into fishponds by early Polynesian settlers, as long ago as 500 AD or earlier.&lt;ref name=Aquaculture&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Costa-Pierce | first1 = B.A. | year = 1987 | title = Aquaculture in ancient Hawaii | url = http://hawaiiseed.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/aquaculture-ancient-hawaii-article.pdf | format = PDF | journal = BioScience | volume = 37 | issue = 5| pages = 320–331 | doi=10.2307/1310688| jstor = 1310688 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Packed earth and cut stone were used to create habitat, making [[ancient Hawaiian aquaculture]] among the most advanced of the original peoples of the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;Burney, Back to the Future in the Caves of Kaua'i. pp.60-62&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example is the [[Menehune Fishpond]] dating from at least 1,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, at Alekoko. At the time of Captain James Cook's arrival, there were at least 360 fishponds producing {{convert|900,000|kg|lb|order=flip}} of fish per year.&lt;ref name=Aquaculture/&gt; Over the course of the last millennium, Hawaiians undertook "large-scale canal-fed pond field irrigation" projects for {{lang|haw|kalo}} (taro) cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;Kirch, Hawaiki, Ancestral Polynesia. pp. 130-131&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as they arrived, the new settlers built {{lang|haw|hale}} (homes) and {{lang|haw|[[heiau]]}} (temples). Archaeologists currently believe that the first settlements were on the southern end of the Big Island of Hawaiʻi and that they quickly extended northwards, along the seacoasts and the easily accessible river valleys. As the population increased, settlements were made further inland.  At this time, with the islands being so small, the population was very dense.  Before European contact, the population had reached somewhere in the range of 200,000 to 1,000,000 people.  After contact with the Europeans, however, the population steeply dropped due to various diseases including [[smallpox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dye |first=Tom |title=Population Trends in Hawaiʻi Before 1778 |journal=The Hawaiian Journal of History |volume=28 |year=1994 |pages=1–20 |url=http://www.pelagicos.net/BIOL3010/readings/Dye_1994.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Village==
[[File:Kahaluu Heiau.jpg|right|thumb|Hāpaiali{{okina}}i and Ke{{okina}}eku Heiau]]
A traditional town of ancient Hawai{{okina}}i included several structures. Listed in order of importance:

* '''[[Heiau]]''', temple to the gods. There were two major types. The agricultural ''mapele'' type was dedicated to [[Lono]], and could be built by the nobility, priests, and land division chiefs, and whose ceremonies were open to all. The second type, [[luakini]], were large  war temples, where animal and [[human sacrifice]]s were made. They were built on high-rising stone terraces and adorned with wood and stone carved idols. A source of great ''[[mana]]'' or divine power, the luakini could only be entered by ''[[ali'i|ali{{okina}}i]]'', the king, important chiefs and nobility, and ''[[kahuna]]'' who were members of the [[Kū]] priesthood.&lt;ref name="Greene1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda W. Greene|title=A Cultural History of Three Traditional Hawaiian Sites on the West Coast of Hawai'i Island|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lE29AQAACAAJ|accessdate=18 March 2018|year=1993|publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Denver Service Center|chapter=Chapter 1, E.6.d}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Hale ali{{okina}}i''', the house of the chief. It was used as a residence for the high chief and meeting house of the lesser chiefs. It was always built on a raised stone foundation to represent high social standing. ''[[Kāhili]]'', or feather standards, were placed outside to signify royalty. Women and children were banned from entering.
* '''Hale pahu''', the house of the sacred hula instruments. It held the ''[[pahu]]'' drums. It was treated as a religious space as [[hula]] was a religious activity in honor of the goddess ''[[Laka]]''.
* '''Hale papa{{okina}}a''', the house of royal storage. It was built to store royal implements including fabrics, prized nets and lines, clubs, spears and other weapons.
* '''Hale ulana''', the house of the weaver. It was the house where craftswomen would gather each day to manufacture the village baskets, fans, mats and other implements from dried pandanus leaves called ''[[lauhala]]''.
* '''Hale mua''', the men's eating house. It was considered a sacred place because it was used to carve stone idols of ''[[aumakua|{{okina}}aumakua]]'' or ancestral gods. Men and women could not eat with each other for fear that men were vulnerable while eating to have their ''[[mana]]'', or divine spirit, stolen by women.  Women ate at their own separate eating house called the ''hale {{okina}}aina''. The design was meant for the men to be able to enter and exit quickly.
* '''Hale wa{{okina}}a''', the house of the canoe. It was built along the beaches as a shelter for their fishing vessels. Hawaiians also stored [[Acacia koa|koa]] logs used to craft the [[canoe]]s.
* '''Hale lawai{{okina}}a''', the house of fishing. It was built along the beaches as a shelter for their fishing nets and lines. Nets and lines were made by a tough rope fashioned from woven [[coconut]] husks.  Fish hooks were made of human, pig or dog bone. Implements found in the ''hale lawai{{okina}}a'' were some of the most prized possessions of the entire village.
* '''Hale noho''', the living house. It was built as sleeping and living quarters for the Hawaiian family unit.
* '''Imu''', the communal earth oven. Dug in the ground, it was used to cook the entire village's food including ''pua{{okina}}a'' or pork. Only men cooked using the ''imu''.

==Caste system==
[[Image:Capa de príncipe hawaiano (M. América Inv.13021) 01.jpg|thumb|180px|right|18th century Hawaiian helmet and cloak, signs of royalty.]]

Ancient Hawai{{okina}}i was a [[caste|caste society]] developed from Polynesians. The main classes were:

* '''[[Ali'i|Ali{{okina}}i]]'''. This class consisted of the high and lesser chiefs of the realms. They governed with divine power called ''[[mana]]''.
* '''[[Kahuna]]'''. Priests conducted religious ceremonies, at the ''[[heiau]]'' and elsewhere. Professionals included master carpenters and boatbuilders, chanters, dancers, genealogists, physicians and healers.
* '''[[Maka'ainana|Maka{{okina}}āinana]]'''. Commoners farmed, fished, and exercised the simpler crafts. They labored not only for themselves and their families, but to support the chiefs and ''[[kahuna]]''.
* '''Kauwā'''. They are believed to have been war captives or the descendants of war captives.  Marriage between higher castes and the ''kauwā'' was strictly forbidden. The ''kauwā'' worked for the chiefs and were often used as human sacrifices at the ''[[luakini]] heiau''. (They were not the only sacrifices; law-breakers of all castes or defeated political opponents were also acceptable as victims.).

==Education==
Hawaiian youth learned life skills and religion at home, often with grandparents.  For "bright" children &lt;ref name="Pukui pp. 90"&gt;Handy and Pukui, The Polynesian Family System in Ka-'U, Hawai'i pp. 90&lt;/ref&gt; a system of apprenticeship existed in which very young students would begin learning a craft or profession by assisting an expert, or ''[[kahuna]]''.  As spiritual powers were perceived by Hawaiians to imbue all of nature, experts in many fields of work were known as ''[[kahuna]]'', a term commonly understood to mean ''priest''.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, M. K. Man, Gods, and Nature. pp. 95&lt;/ref&gt;  The various types of ''[[kahuna]]'' passed on knowledge of their profession, be it in "genealogies, or ''[[Mele (Hawaiian language)|mele]]'', or herb medicine, or canoe building, or land boundaries,"&lt;ref&gt;Handy, E. S. C. Ancient Hawaiian Civilization pp. 55-57&lt;/ref&gt; etc. by involving and instructing apprentices in their work.  More formal schools existed for the study of ''[[hula]]'', and likely for the study of higher levels of sacred knowledge.

The ''[[kahuna]]'' took the apprentice into his household as a member of the family, although often "the tutor was a relative".&lt;ref name="Pukui pp. 90"/&gt;  During a religious "graduation" ceremony, "the teacher consecrated the pupil, who thereafter was one with the teacher in psychic relationship as definite and obligatory as blood relationship." &lt;ref name="Pukui pp. 90"/&gt;  Like the children learning from their grandparents, children who were apprentices learned by watching and participating in daily life.  Children were discouraged from asking questions in traditional Hawaiian culture.

==Land tenure==
In Hawaiian ideology, one does not "own" the land, but merely dwells on it. The belief was that both the land and the gods were immortal. This then informed the belief that land was also godly, and therefore above mortal and ungodly humans, and humans therefore could not own land. The Hawaiians thought that all land belonged to the gods (''akua'').

The ''[[ali'i|ali{{okina}}i]]'' were believed to be "managers" of land. That is, they controlled those who worked on the land, the ''[[maka'ainana|maka{{okina}}āinana]]''. 
	 			
On the death of one chief and the accession of another, lands were re-apportioned—some of the previous "managers" would lose their lands, and others would gain them. Lands were also re-apportioned when one chief defeated another and re-distributed the conquered lands as rewards to his warriors. 	

In practice, commoners had some security against capricious re-possession of their houses and farms. They were usually left in place, to pay tribute and supply labor to a new chief, under the supervision of a new ''[[konohiki]]'', or overseer. 	

This system of land tenure is similar to the [[Feudalism|feudal system]] prevalent in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]]. 	

The ancient Hawaiians had the ''[[ahupuaa|ahupua{{okina}}a]]'' as their source of water management. Each ''[[ahupuaa|ahupua{{okina}}a]]'' had a sub-division of land from the mountain to the sea. The Hawaiians used the water from the rain that ran through the mountains as a form of irrigation. Hawaiians also settled around these parts of the land because of the farming that was done.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, Alan. "Ancient Polynesia." 19 Nov. 2013. p.13. Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion and the Kapu system ==
{{main article|Kapu}}
[[Hawaiian religion|Religion]] held ancient Hawaiian society together, affecting habits, lifestyles, work methods, social policy and law. The legal system was based on religious ''[[kapu]]'', or [[taboo]]s. There was a correct way to live, to worship, and even to eat.  Examples of ''[[kapu]]'' included the provision that men and women could not eat together ({{okina}}Aikapu religion). Fishing was limited to specified seasons of the year. The shadow of the ''[[ali'i|ali{{okina}}i]]'' must not be touched as it was stealing his ''[[mana]]''.

The rigidity of the ''[[kapu]]'' system might have come from a second wave of migrations in 1000–1300 from which different religions and systems were shared between Hawai{{okina}}i and the Society Islands. Hawai{{okina}}i would have been influenced by the Tahitian chiefs, the ''[[kapu]]'' system would have become stricter, and the social structure would have changed. Human sacrifice would have become a part of their new religious observance, and the ''[[ali'i|ali{{okina}}i]]'' would have gained more power over the counsel of experts on the islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaiihistory.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ig.page&amp;CategoryID=311 Polynesian Migrations. Hawaii History. 14 November 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726143320/http://www.hawaiihistory.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ig.page&amp;CategoryID=311 |date=July 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kapu'' was derived from traditions and beliefs from Hawaiian worship of gods, demigods and ancestral ''[[mana]]''. The forces of nature were personified as the main gods of [[Kū]] (God of War), [[Kāne Milohai|Kāne]] (God of Light and Life), [[Kanaloa]] (God of Death), and [[Lono]] (God of peace and growth). Well-known lesser gods include [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] (Goddess of Fire) and her sister [[Hi'iaka|Hi{{okina}}iaka]] (Goddess of Dance). In a famous creation story, the demigod [[Māui (Hawaiian mythology)|Māui]] fished the islands of Hawai{{okina}}i from the sea after a little mistake he made on a fishing trip. From [[Haleakala|Haleakalā]], Māui ensnared the sun in another story, forcing him to slow down so there were equal periods of darkness and light each day.

The Hawaiian mystical worldview allows for different gods and spirits to imbue any aspect of the natural world.&lt;ref name="Dudley, Man pp. 77"&gt;Dudley, Man, Gods, and Nature. pp. 77&lt;/ref&gt; From this mystical perspective, in addition to his presence in lightning and rainbows, the God of Light and Life, [[Kāne Milohai|Kāne]], can be present in rain and clouds and a peaceful breeze (typically the "home" of [[Lono]]).

Although all food and drink had religious significance to the ancient Hawaiians, special cultural emphasis was placed on [[Kava|''{{okina}}awa'' (''kava'')]] due to its narcotic properties.  This root-based beverage, a psychoactive and a relaxant, was used to consecrate meals and commemorate ceremonies.  It is often referred to in Hawaiian chant.&lt;ref&gt;Handy, Ancient Hawaiian Civilization. pp. 63&lt;/ref&gt;  Different varieties of the root were used by different castes, and the brew served as an "introduction to mysticism".&lt;ref name="Dudley, Man pp. 77"/&gt;

==Chiefs==
{{main article|Ruling chiefs of Hawaii}}
The four biggest islands, the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawaiʻi]], [[Maui]], [[Kauaʻi]] and [[Oʻahu]] were generally ruled by their own ''[[aliʻi|aliʻi nui]]'' (supreme ruler) with lower ranking subordinate chiefs called ''aliʻi ʻaimoku'', ruling individual districts with land agents called ''[[konohiki]]''.

All these dynasties were interrelated and regarded all the [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian people]] (and possibly all humans) as descendants of legendary parents, [[Wākea]] (symbolizing the air) and his wife [[Papahānaumoku|Papa]] (symbolizing the earth). Up to the late eighteenth century, the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawaiʻi]] had been ruled by one line descended from [[Umi-a-Liloa]]. At the death of [[Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku]], a lower ranking chief, [[Alapainui]], overthrew the two sons of the former ruler who were next in line as the island's ''aliʻi nui''.

Assuming five to ten generations per century, the ''Ali{{okina}}i ʻAimoku'' dynasties were around three to six centuries old at 1800 AD. The Tahitian settlement of the Hawaiian islands is believed to have taken place in the thirteenth century. The ''[[ali'i|ali{{okina}}i]]'' and other social castes were presumably established during this period.

==Subsistence economy==
The ancient Hawaiian economy became complex over time.  People began to specialize in specific skills.  Generations of families became committed to certain careers: roof thatchers, house builders, stone grinders, bird catchers who would make the feather cloaks of the ''[[ali'i|ali{{okina}}i]]'', canoe builders.  Soon, entire islands began to specialize in certain skilled trades.  [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]] became the chief ''[[kapa]]'' (tapa bark cloth) manufacturer.  [[Maui]] became the chief canoe manufacturer.  The island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i]] exchanged bales of dried fish.

==First recorded European contact==
European contact with the Hawaiian islands marked the beginning of the end of the ancient Hawai{{okina}}i period. In 1778, British Captain [[James Cook]] landed first on [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]], then sailed southwards to observe and explore the other islands in the chain.

When he first arrived at [[Kealakekua Bay]] in 1779, some of the natives believed Cook was their god [[Lono]].  Cook's mast and sails coincidentally resembled the emblem (a mast and sheet of white ''[[kapa]]'') that symbolized [[Lono]] in their religious rituals; the ships arrived during the ''[[Makahiki]]'' season dedicated to [[Lono]].

Captain Cook was eventually killed during a violent confrontation and left behind on the beach by his retreating sailors. The British demanded that his body be returned, but the Hawaiians had already performed funerary rituals of their tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Kamakau 1961, pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few decades [[Kamehameha I]] used European warfare tactics and some firearms and cannon to unite the islands into the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]].

The '''Bamileke''' &lt;!-- ([[French language|French]] '''''Bamiléké''''') This is an article in english --&gt; is the native group which is now dominant in Cameroon's West and Northwest Regions. It is part of the [[Semi-Bantu]] (or Grassfields Bantu) [[ethnic group]].  The Bamileke are regrouped under several groups, each under the guidance of a [[Tribal chief|chief]] or [[Fon (Cameroon)|fon]]. Nonetheless, all of these groups have the same ancestors as ancient Egyptian and thus share the same history, culture, and languages.  They speak a number of related languages from the [[Bantoid languages|Bantoid]] branch of the [[Niger–Congo language family]]. These languages are closely related, however, and some classifications identify a [[Bamileke languages|Bamileke]] [[dialect continuum]] with seventeen or more dialects.

==Organization==
The Bamileke are organized under several chiefdom (or fondom). Of these, the fondoms of [[Bafang]], [[Bafoussam]], [[Bandjoun]], [[Baham, Cameroon|Baham]], [[Bangangté]], [[Bawaju]], [[Dschang]], and [[Mbouda]] are the most prominent. The Bamileke also share much history and culture with the neighbouring fondoms of the [[Northwest Region, Cameroon|Northwest region]] and notably the [[Lebialem]] region of the [[Southwest Region, Cameroon|Southwest region]], but the groups have been divided since their territories were split between the French and English in [[Scramble for Africa|colonial times]].

==Languages==
{{main|Bamileke languages}}
Following Ethnologue classification, we can identify 11 different languages or dialects:

Variants of [[Ghomala']] are spoken in most of the [[Mifi]], [[Koung-Khi]], [[Hauts-Plateaux]] [[Departments of Cameroon|department]]s, the eastern [[Menoua]], and portions of [[Bamboutos]], by 260,00 people (1982, SIL). The main fondoms are [[Baham, Cameroon|Baham]], [[Bafoussam]], [[Bamendjou]], [[Bandjoun]].

Towards southwest is spoken [[Fe'fe' language|Fe'fe']] in the [[Haut-Nkam|Upper Nkam division]]. The main towns include [[Bafang]], [[Baku]], and [[Kékem]].

[[Nda'nda']] occupy the western third of the [[Ndé]] division. The major settlement is at [[Bazou]].

[[Yemba language|Yemba]] is spoken by 300,000 or more people in 1992. Their lands span most of the [[Menoua]] division to the west of the Bandjoun, with their capital at [[Dschang]]. [[Fokoué]] is another major settlement.

[[Medumba]] is spoken in most of the Ndé division, by 210,000 people in 1991, with major settlements at [[Bangangté]] and [[Tonga]].

[[Mengaka]], [[Ngiemboon]], [[Ngomba]] and [[Ngombale]] are spoken in [[Mbouda]].
[[File:Funérailles-Bamougong.jpg|thumb|Bamileke culture]]
'''Kwa''' is spoken between the Ndé and the Littoral region, '''[[Ngwe language|Ngwe]]''' around Fontem in the Southwest region, and [[Mmuock_language|Mmuock (language)]] by the [[Mmuock]] people in the Lebialem division of the Southwest region.

Bamileke belongs to the Mbam-Nkam group of Grassfields languages, whose attachment to the Bantu division is still disputed. While some consider it a Bantu or semi-Bantu language, others prefer to include Bamileke in the [[Niger-Congo]] group.&lt;ref name="Bamileke Language"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cameroon: Treatment of members of the Bamileke tribe by the authorities, and the language spoken and written by this tribe |url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3f7d4d7134.html |website=Refworld |publisher=Canada: Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada |accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bamileke Medumba apparently stems from ancient Egyptian and is the root language for many Bamileke variants.&lt;ref name="Bamileke Language"/&gt;

==History==
&lt;!---Main source: ''“Histoire et anthropologie du peuple bamiléké”'' (Paris: l’Harmattan, 2016, 338p.), by Dieudonné Toukam.ISBN 978-2-296-11827-0---&gt;
The Bamileke are the native people of three regions of Cameroon, namely West, North-West and South-West. Though greater part of this people are from the West region, it is estimated that almost half of Bamileke are from the English speaking regions, the majority of which are from the North-West region (there are 123 Bamileke groupings in this region, against 06 in the South-West and 106 in the Western region). The Grassfields area therefore encompasses the West and North-West and small part of the South-West region of Cameroon. Apart from the Bamileke, there are other tribes that are historically more or less linked to the Bamileke, whether by blood or through certain cultural intercourse  (Dieudonné Toukam, “Histoire et anthropologie du peuple bamiléké”, 2016), as well as recently settled foreigners (Fulani, Haoussa, Igbo, etc.)

The Bamileke speak a semi-Bantu language and are related to Bantu peoples.  Historically, the Bamun and the Bamileke were united. The founder of this group (Nchare) was the younger brother of the founder of Bafoussam. Bamiléké are a group comprising many tribes. In this group, there are several superficial cultural disparities, including Dschang, Bafang, Bagangté, Mbouda and Bafoussam.

During the mid-17th century, the Bamiléké people's forefathers left the North to avoid being forced to convert to Islam. They migrated as far south as Foumban. Conquerors came all the way to Foumban to try to impose Islam on them. A war began, pushing some people to leave while others remained, submitting to Islam. This marks the division between the Bamun and Bamiléké people.

Bantu refers to a large, complex linguistic grouping of peoples in Africa. The Cameroon-Bamileke Bantu people cluster encompasses multiple Bantu ethnic groups primarily found in Cameroon, the largest of which is the Bamileke. The Bamileke, whose origins trace to [[Egypt]], migrated from Upper-Egypt in the 9th century and made their last long-lasting settlement in the Tikar region (now Banyo) where they arrived in the 12th century (read D. Toukam, 2016). In the 17th century they migrated further south and west to avoid being forced to convert to Islam. Another reason for migration was to resist enslavement during the [[Atlantic Slave Trade]]. Today, a majority of peoples within this people cluster are Christians.

===German administration===
[[Germany]] gained control of "Kamerun" in 1884. &lt;!-- The Bamileke quickly adapted to the new realities of [[colonialism]] by establishing themselves as enterprising traders and partners with the new rulers.''' The Germans urged or forced large numbers of Bamileke settlers to move south to work the coastal [[plantation]]s they had planted there. This is wrong. At that time, the German were only at the coast of "Kamerun" --&gt;

The [[Germany|Germans]] first applied the term "Bamileke" to the people as administrative shorthand for the people of the region. &lt;!-- It was during German (and later [[France|French]]) colonial rule that the Bamileke first began to regard themselves as a single, albeit fragmented, people. This is not true--&gt;

===French administration and post-independence===
The Bamileke are very dynamic and have a great sense of entrepreneurship. Thus, they can be found in almost all regions of Cameroon and in the world, mainly as business owners.

In 1955, the colonial French power banned the [[Union des Populations du Cameroun]] (UPC) political party, which was claiming the independence of Cameroon. Following that, the French started an offensive against UPC militants. Much of fighting occurred in the West region, region of the Bamileke. Some tens of thousands of people died in the UPC conflict with French and Cameroonian troops.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Africa (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"WHPSI": The World Handbook of Political and Social Indicators by Charles Lewis Taylor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Willard R. 1970.

==Lifestyle and settlement patterns==

===Political structure and agriculture===
[[Image:Statue d'un chef coutumier à Bana.jpg|thumb|Statue of a chief at [[Bana, Cameroon|Bana]].]]
[[File:Végétation Bamougong.jpg|left|thumb|Bamileke Grassland]]
The Bamileke's settlements follow a well-organized and structured pattern. Houses of family members are often grouped together, often surrounded by small fields. Men typically clear the fields, but it is largely women who work them. Most work is done with tools such as machetes and hoes. Staple crops include [[Taro|cocoyam]]s, [[peanut|groundnut]]s and [[maize]].

Bamileke settlement are organized as chiefdoms. The chief, or ''fon'' or ''fong'' is considered as the spiritual, political, judicial and military leader. The Chief is also considered as the 'Father' of the chiefdom. He thus has great respect from the population. The successor of the 'Father' is chosen among his children. The successor's identity is typically kept secret until the fon's death.

The fon has typically 9 ministers and several other advisers and councils. The ministers are in charge of the crowning of the new fon.
The council of ministers, also known as the Council of Notables is called ''Kamveu''. In addition, a "queen mother" or ''mafo'' was an important figure for some fons in the past. Below the fon and his advisers lie a number of ward heads, each responsible for a particular portion of the village. Some Bamileke groups also recognise sub-chiefs, or ''fonte''.

===Economic activities===
[[Image:Case à la chefferie de Bana.jpg|thumb|Hut at the ''chefferie'' of [[Bana, Cameroon|Bana]].]]

Traditional homes are constructed by first erecting a [[raffia]]-pole frame into four square walls. Builders then stuff the resulting holes with grass and cover the whole building with mud. The thatched roof is typically shaped into a tall cone. Nowadays, however, this type of construction is mostly reserved for barns, storage buildings, and gathering places for various traditional [[secret society|secret societies]]. Instead, modern Bamileke homes are made of bricks of either sun-dried mud or of concrete. Roofs are of metal sheeting.

===Religious beliefs===
[[File:Lieu sacré à Bamougong.jpg|left|thumb|Sacred Place]]
During the colonial period, parts of the Bamileke adopted [[Christianity]]. Some of them practice [[Islam]] toward the border with the [[Adamawa Region, Cameroon|Adamawa]] Tikar and the Bamun. The Bamileke have worn elephant mask for dance ceremonies or funerals.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Succession and kinship patterns===
The Bamileke trace ancestry, [[inheritance]] and succession through the male line, and children belong to the fondom of their father. After a man's death, all of his possessions typically go to a single, male heir. [[Polygamy]] (more specifically, [[polygyny]]) is practiced, and some important individuals may have literally hundreds of wives. Marriages typically involve a [[bride price]] to be paid to the bride's family.

It is argued that the Bamileke inheritance customs contributed to their success in the modern world:

"Succession and inheritance rules are determined by the principle of patrilineal descent. According to custom, the eldest son is the probable heir, but a father may choose any one of his sons to succeed him. An heir takes his dead father's name and inherits any titles held by the latter, including the right to membership in any societies to which he belonged. And, until the mid-1960s, when the law governing polygamy was changed, the heir also inherited his father's wives--a considerable economic responsibility. The rights in land held by the deceased were conferred upon the heir subject to the approval of the chief, and, in the event of financial inheritance, the heir was not obliged to share this with other family members. The ramifications of this are significant. First, dispossessed family members were not automatically entitled to live off the wealth of the heir. Siblings who did not share in the inheritance were, therefore, strongly encouraged to make it on their own through individual initiative and by assuming responsibility for earning their livelihood. Second, this practice of individual responsibility in contrast to a system of strong family obligations prevented a drain on individual financial resources. Rather than spend all of the inheritance maintaining unproductive family members, the heir could, in the contemporary period, utilize his resources in more financially productive ways such as for savings and investment. [...] Finally, the system of inheritance, along with the large-scale migration resulting from population density and land pressures, is one of the internal incentives that accounts for Bamileke success in the nontraditional world".&lt;ref&gt;A.I.D. Evaluation Special Study No. 15  THE PRIVATE SECTOR: - Individual Initiative, And Economic Growth In An African Plural Society The Bamileke Of Cameroon http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pnaal016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald L. Horowitz]] also attributes the economic success of the Bamileke to their inheritance customs, arguing that it encouraged younger sons to seek their own living abroad. He wrote in ''Ethnic groups in conflict'': "Primogeniture among the Bamileke and matrilineal inheritance among the Minangkabau of Indonesia have contributed powerfully to the propensity of males from both groups to migrate out of their home region in search of opportunity".&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=Q82saX1HVQYC&amp;pg=PA155&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barossa German''' ({{lang-de|Barossadeutsch}} or {{lang|de|Barossa-Deutsch}}) is  a [[dialect]] of [[German language|German]], predominately spoken in the [[Barossa Valley]] region of [[South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlas.sa.gov.au/go/resources/atlas-of-south-australia-1986/regional-areas/barossa-valley Atlas of South Australia | Barossa Valley&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807020924/http://www.atlas.sa.gov.au/go/resources/atlas-of-south-australia-1986/regional-areas/barossa-valley |date=7 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prominent South Australian writer, [[Colin Thiele]] (1920–2006), whose grandparents were [[German people|German]] immigrants, referred to "Barossa-Deutsch" as: "that quaintly inbred and hybrid language evolved from a century of linguistic isolation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20412496-27648,00.html Stephany Steggall, "Teller of tales that teach" (''The Australian'', 15 September 2006)]. Access date: 7 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It takes its name from the [[Barossa Valley]], where many German people settled during the 19th century. Some words from Barossa German have entered [[South Australian English]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/linguafranca/stories/2004/1052272.htm ABC Radio National, "South Australian Words" (''Lingua Franca'', 28 February 2004).] Access date: 7 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|German Australian}}
The first wave of [[German settlement in Australia]] began in 1838. German was first spoken in the Barossa Valley in the 1840s, when German [[Lutheran]] settlers from [[Prussia]] arrived in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.germanaustralia.com/d/d-bethany.htm Dave Nutting, 2001, "Bethany &amp;mdash; the first settlement in the Barossa Valley"] ''German Australia '' (website). Access date: 9 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the German language in Australia declined as a result of [[World War I]]. Many Germans were [[internment|interned]], and immigration by German people was officially banned between 1914 and 1925. In addition, the German language was actively suppressed by the Australian government during the war. For example, many [[Australian place names changed from German names|placenames with German origins were changed]]. Lutheran schools were closed and were re-opened as state schools teaching in English.[http://www.southaustralianhistory.com.au/lutheran.htm]

There is some evidence that Barossa German was the [[first language]] of some people in South Australia until the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Steggall, ''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Colin Thiele]] claimed to have spoken nothing but German until he went to school.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Classification==
Because most German immigrants to the Barossa were from [[Prussia]] and [[Silesia]], Barossa German is classifiable as a [[Central German]] dialect.{{cn|date=March 2017}} It is therefore relatively close to [[Standard German]], when compared to analogous dialects spoken by [[Ethnic Germans|German diaspora]] communities around the world.

According to linguist Peter Mickan, Barossa German has incorporated some elements of [[South Australian English]], including some English [[vocabulary]] and [[English grammar|grammatical form]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Australia Wide'' (television program), 'ABC News 24, (broadcast date: 25 March 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary and culture==
The best-known examples of Barossa German vocabulary are words which have been adopted by South Australian English. One such local word with German origins is "butcher", the name given to a 200 [[litre|ml]] (7 [[fluid ounce|fl.oz.]]) beer glass, which is believed to be derived from the German ''becher'', meaning a cup or mug.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/ling/stories/s1052272.htm ABC Radio National, ''Lingua Franca'', 28 February 2004, "South Australian Words"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Barossa is also home to [[Kegel (bowling)|kegel]], a variety of nine-pin [[bowling]], which takes place on indoor lanes (''Kegelbahn''), and is based on traditional German games similar to alley [[Skittles (sport)|skittles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tradgames.org.uk/games/Skittles.htm Skittles, Nine Pins - Online guide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602235159/http://www.tradgames.org.uk/games/Skittles.htm |date=2 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Barossa town of [[Tanunda, South Australia|Tanunda]] still features the Tanunda Kegel Club, founded in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.germanaustralia.com/e/traditions.htm{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2873">'''Cape Verdean Cuban''' are [[Cuba]]n citizens or residents whose ancestry originated in [[Cape Verde]].

[[Cape Verde]] and [[Cuba]] have had a long history. The first people from Cape Verde to Cuba came involuntarily. In 1526, the "first known shipment of slaves intended for sale in [[Cuba]] carries 145 Africans from [[Cape Verde|Cabo Verde]] to the island."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/buenavista/music/timeline.html Ron Conner, "Timeline of Cuban Musical History." PBS. Retrieved October 26, 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; More slaves from [[Cape Verde]] would follow. This would include the ancestor of [[Roel Caboverde Llacer]], a famous Cuban artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubanartstore.com/caboverde.htm Reinaldo Cedeño Pineda, " Roel Caboverde Llacer - Interview." Cuban Art Store. Retrieved October 26, 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cuba]] and [[Cape Verde]] established diplomatic relations in September 1975, a few months after Cape Verdean independence. "Since 1976, over 1,000 Cuban collaborators, mostly physicians and health technicians, have been working in that African nation, and nearly 1,000 Cape Verdean scholarship students have completed pre-university and university studies in Cuba."&lt;ref name=Castro&gt;[http://www.cubaminrex.cu/english/currentissues/2005/Fidel%20Castro%20Decorates.htm "Fidel Castro Decorates Cape Verde´s President."

In 2005, [[Germano Almeida|Germano Almeida's]] ''Two Brothers'' was translated into Spanish and included in an ''Arts and Literature'' anthology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070528163214/http://www.clacso.org.ar/difusion/secciones/programa-de-cooperacion-sur-sur/Descargables/ceamonitor-ago-2006_archivos.htm David González, "Nueva literatura caboverdiana en Cuba."

One third of all marriages in Turkey are child marriages and one third of women get married under the age of 18.&lt;ref name="cumhgaun"&gt;{{cite web|title=Üç kadından biri 18 yaşından önce evleniyor|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/yasam/3781/Uc_kadindan_biri_18_yasindan_once_evleniyor.html|publisher=Cumhuriyet|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=monitor&gt;{{cite web|title=New focus on child brides in Turkey|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/01/turkey-marriage-child-brides-poverty-education-religion.html#|publisher=Al-Monitor|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nsnbc"&gt;{{cite web|title=One in Three a Child Marriage in Turkey|url=http://nsnbc.me/2013/10/14/one-three-child-marriage-turkey/|publisher=NSNBC|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2002 and 2014, 504,957 children officially got married at the ages of 16 and 17.&lt;ref name="huryrm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yarım milyon resmi çocuk gelin|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/yarim-milyon-resmi-cocuk-gelin-25964425|publisher=Hürriyet|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2010 and 2013, this official figure was 134,629. Child marriages affect girls very disproportionately, about 20 times as much as boys; around 129,000 of those involved in child marriages were girls, whilst only 6,000 were boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=18 yaşını doldurmadan evlenen kız çocuğu sayısı son 3 yılda 130 bin oldu|url=http://t24.com.tr/haber/cocuk-gelinler-icin-15-bin-aileyle-gorusme,232899|publisher=T24|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Child marriages involving girls often involve girls that are much younger than boys in child marriages.&lt;ref name="tbmm"&gt;{{cite web|title=ERKEN YAŞTA EVLİLİKLER HAKKINDA İNCELEME YAPILMASINA DAİR RAPOR|url=https://www.tbmm.gov.tr/komisyon/kefe/docs/komisyon_rapor.pdf|publisher=Grand National Assembly of Turkey|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, around 20,000 families filed requests for permission to marry their daughters who were younger than 16.&lt;ref name="cumhgaun"/&gt; Between 2010 and 2013, there was a 94% increase in the number of families applying for permission to get their underage daughters (younger than 15) married.&lt;ref name=monitor/&gt; According to a 2013 [[Hacettepe University]] report supported by the Turkish government, 7.1% of all girls aged 15-19 were married.&lt;ref name="hacettepe"/&gt; 26% of women between the ages of 15 and 49 reported that they were married as a child.&lt;ref name="tnsa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kadınların yüzde 26’sı çocuk yaşta gelin oldu|url=http://t24.com.tr/haber/kadinlarin-yuzde-26si-cocuk-yasta-gelin-oldu,280667|publisher=T24|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual numbers of child marriages are estimated to be far higher than the official figures as many child marriages take place as unofficial religious marriages, without state authorization.&lt;ref name=hureng1&gt;{{cite web|title=Child marriages make up one third in Turkey|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/child-marriages-make-up-one-third-in-turkey.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=92170&amp;NewsCatID=339|publisher=Hürriyet|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure had decreased from 15.2% in 1998.&lt;ref name="tbmm"/&gt;

Child marriages take place in every region of Turkey. However, the provinces where the proportions are the greatest are concentrated in Eastern and Central Anatolia.&lt;ref name="t24kcin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Çocuk gelinlerin en çok olduğu iller hangileri?|url=http://t24.com.tr/haber/kadin-cinayetleri-en-cok-ayrilik-nedeniyle-isleniyor,244541|publisher=T24|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Gaziantep University research, the proportion of child marriages in the city of [[Şanlıurfa]] is around 60%, whereas that in [[İzmir]], known for its cosmopolitanism, is around 16-17%.&lt;ref name=monitor/&gt; According to the [[Turkish Statistical Institute]], the following provinces had the highest proportions of child marriage in 2013 (all between 35% and 42%): [[Yozgat Province|Yozgat]], [[Nevşehir Province|Nevşehir]], [[Niğde Province|Niğde]], [[Kahramanmaraş Province|Kahramanmaraş]], [[Kilis Province|Kilis]], [[Muş Province|Muş]], [[Siirt Province|Siirt]], [[Bitlis Province|Bitlis]], [[Van Province|Van]], [[Ağrı Province|Ağrı]], [[Kars Province|Kars]] and [[Ardahan Province|Ardahan]].&lt;ref name="t24kcin"/&gt;

According to a 2018 Turkish report regarding child marriage in Turkey a total of 482,908 underage women were married in the last 10 years. “In Turkey, 26 percent of females were married before the age of 18. Ten percent of them gave birth before the age of 18. Some 142,298 underage mothers were recorded in the last six years. Most of these children were married with religious ceremonies. A total of 440,000 underage girls have given birth since 2002. The number of women under 15 who gave birth after being exposed to sexual abuse was recorded as 15,937.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/22-000-teenage-pregnancies-recorded-in-18-months-report-139020 22,000 teenage pregnancies recorded in 18 months: Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==
=== Education ===
According to a 2013 [[Gaziantep University]] research, 82% of child brides in Turkey are illiterate.&lt;ref name="nsnbc"/&gt; Official reports indicated that 675 girls who were enrolled in primary schools had dropped out during the course of the year in 2009 due to marriage or betrothal, as opposed to 18 boys.&lt;ref name="tbmm"/&gt; 97.4% of students who discontinue their educational pursuits due to child marriage are girls.&lt;ref name=hureng1/&gt;

=== Health and sexual violence ===
Between 2012 and 2014, 90,483 cases were filed in Turkey about the rape, sexual harassment or exploitation of underage girls. 17,000 girls were reported as missing between 2011 and 2014.&lt;ref name="huryrm"/&gt; The leading causes for the deaths of girls aged 15-19 in Turkey are childbirth and pregnancy complications.&lt;ref name=hureng1/&gt; According to a 2013 Hacettepe research supported by the Turkish government, of women ages 20-49, 9.5% reportedly first gave birth before the age of 18 and 0.8% gave birth before the age of 15.&lt;ref name="hacettepe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nüfus ve Sağlık Araştırması 2013|url=http://www.hips.hacettepe.edu.tr/tnsa2013/rapor/TNSA_2013_ana_rapor.pdf|publisher=Hacettepe University|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first six months of 2011, 300 children gave birth in hospitals in [[Diyarbakır Province|Diyarbakır]] and [[Şanlıurfa Province|Şanlurfa]] provinces alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Altı ayda 300 çocuk gelin doğum yaptı|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/alti-ayda-300-cocuk-gelin-dogum-yapti-25573120|publisher=Hürriyet|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal framework ==
Child marriage is outlawed in Turkey and is punishable by imprisonment for the man who marries an underage girl and for third parties who plan the marriage.&lt;ref name="tbmm"/&gt; However, there is a discrepancy in the legal framework regarding child marriage: the minimum age for the marriage of girls is 15 according to the Turkish Penal Code, 17 (for both sexes) according to the Turkish Civil Code and 18 according to the Child Protection Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Çakmak|first1=Diren|title=TÜRKİYE’DE ÇOCUK GELİNLER|url=http://www.umut.org.tr/UserFiles/Files/Document/document_DIREN%20CAKMAK.doc|publisher=Umut Association|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish Civil Code also maintained a minimum marriageable age of 15 for girls until a change in 2002.&lt;ref name="tbmm"/&gt; According to activists, the legal framework is not the limiting factor in the struggle against child marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOSYAL MEYDAN: Çocuk yaşta evlilik|url=http://www.bbc.com/turkce/haberler/140116_canli_cocuk_yasta_evlilik|publisher=BBC Turkish|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the governing [[Islamism|Islamist]] conservative [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) sought to introduce legislation which would have made child rape no longer punishable if the perpetrator would offer to marry his victim; this was withdrawn after a public outcry against what was widely seen as an attempt of "legitimising rape and encouraging child marriage".&lt;ref name="AKP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/24/women-vulnerable-turkey-child-rape|title=Women and vulnerable people are paying for Turkey’s authoritarianism|last=|first=|date=24 November 2016|website=|publisher=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12843">Indigenous actors have a myriad experiences because of the wildly different areas they inhabit across the globe and they bring a wide variety of experiences that Western science is beginning to include in its research of climate change and its solutions.

== Impact of climate change of indigenous actors ==
Reports show that millions of people will across the world will have to relocate due to rising seas, floods, droughts, and storms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While this will affect people all over the world, the impact will disproportionately affect indigenous people in regions like the [[Arctic]] and Pacific.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kapua'ala Sproat, D. "An Indigenous People’s Right to Environmental Self-Determination: Native Hawaiians and the Struggle Against Climate Change Devastation." Stanford Environmental Law Journal 35, no. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, not taking restorative action for indigenous actors could lead not only to the destruction of their lands, but could also prove genocidal for them as a whole.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is because indigenous people are connected to their climate, sharing a spiritual and cultural bond with their resources, in a way that others are not. One native group in Hawaii, the Maoli, for example, believes that they are physically related to all natural things present in the island archipelago.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On the other hand, Westerners tend to identify not with the land they inhabit, but instead identify themselves based on their occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Lorraine. "‘Who You Is?’ Work and Identity in Aboriginal New South Wales." In Indigenous Participation in Australian Economies: Historical and Anthropological Perspectives, 127-39. Canberra, ACT: ANU E Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, indigenous people are the most affected by climate change and the 2009 report from the Indigenous Peoples' Global Summit on Climate Change outlines the negative effects experienced by indigenous communities in 7 regions across the globe.

=== [[Arctic]] ===
[[File:NASA-28yrs-Arctic-Warming.jpg|thumb|Arctic temperature warming]]
Climate change has been the worst in the Arctic, not only with a temperature increase twice the magnitude of the increase in the rest of the world, but also with a sinking of the ice in the Arctic Sea. Satellite images of the ice show that it is currently has the smallest area in recorded history.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;"Report of the Indigenous Peoples' Global Summit on Climate Change." Proceedings of Indigenous People's Global Summit on Climate Change, Alaska, Anchorage.&lt;/ref&gt; If left unchecked, [[climate change in the Arctic]] will lead to a faster rise in sea levels, more frequent and intense storms and winds, further decreases in the extent of sea ice, and increased [[erosion]] due to higher waves.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This climate change will also have health effects on the native [[Inuit]] people for a variety of reasons. Eroding coasts and thinning ice have changed the [[Animal migration|migration]] patterns of the numerous animal species upon which the Inuit rely for food.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Simultaneously, increased temperatures and melting permafrost will make it harder for Inuit people to freeze and store food in their traditional way. Furthermore, climate change will bring new bacteria and other micro-[[organism]]s to the region, which will bring yet unknown effects to the peoples of the region.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== [[Latin America]] ===
[[File:Amazon6 (5641584266).jpg|thumb|Amazon Deforestation near Manaus, the capital of the Brazilian state of Amazonas]]
Extractive industries in the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] and the Amazonian Basin are threatening the livelihood of indigenous persons. These extractive policies were originally implemented without the consent of indigenous people are now being implemented without respect to the [[Rights of indigenous peoples|rights of indigenous people]], specifically in the case of [[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation|REDD]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Most indigenous groups in Latin American tropical forests still operate on a hunter-gatherer system, and have no signs of stopping while indigenous groups in the rest of the globe's tropical forests are becoming more sedentary.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Macchi, Mirjam. "Indigenous and Traditional Peoples and Climate Change." ''IUCN'', March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, deforestation will have a disproportionate effect on indigenous people in Latin American tropical forests. Furthermore, climate change has altered the patterns of migratory birds and changed the start and end times of wet and dry seasons, further increasing the disorientation of the daily lives of indigenous people in Latin America.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Pacific ===
The region is characterized by low elevation and insular coastlines, making it severely susceptible to the increased sea-level and erosion effects of climate change.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Entire islands have sunk in the Pacific region due to climate change, dislocating and killing indigenous persons.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Furthermore, the region suffers from increased frequency and severity of cyclones, inundation and intensified tides, and decreased [[biodiversity]] due to the destruction of coral reefs and sea [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This decrease in biodiversity is coupled with a decreased populations of the fish and other sea life the indigenous people of the region rely upon for food.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Indigenous people of the region are also losing many of its food sources, such as sugarcane, yams, taro, and bananas, to climate change as well as seeing a decrease in the amount of drinkable water made available from rainfall.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== [[Caribbean]] ===
The main effect of climate change in the Caribbean region is the increased occurrence of extreme weather events. There have been an influx of flash floods, tsunamis, earthquakes, extreme winds, and landslides in the region.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These events have led to wide-ranging infrastructural damage to both public and private property for all. For example, Hurricane Ivan inflicted damage totalling 135% of Grenada's GDP to Grenada, setting the country back an estimated ten years in development.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The effects of these events are most strongly felt, however, by indigenous persons, who have been forced to move to the most extreme areas of the country due to the lasting effects that [[colonialism]] had on the region.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In these extreme regions, extreme weather events are even more pronounced, leading to crop and livestock devastation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== [[Asia]] ===
Indigenous people in Asia are plagued with a wide variety of problems due to climate change, including but not limited to, lengthy droughts, floods, irregular seasonal cycles, typhoons and cyclones with unprecedented strength, and highly unpredictable weather.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This has led to worsening food and water security, which in turn factor into an increase in water-borne diseases, heat strokes, and malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Indigenous lifestyles in Asia have been completely uprooted and disrupted due to the above factors, but also due to the increased expansion of monoculture plantations, hydroelectric dams, and the extraction of uranium on their lands and territories prior to their free and informed consent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== [[Africa]] ===
[[File:Farm tools, Malawi.jpg|thumb|Farm tools from Malawi, where researchers studied indigenous agriculture techniques.]]
Climate change in Africa will lead to food insecurity, displacement of indigenous persons, as well as increased famine, drought, and floods.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In some regions of Africa, like Malawi, climate change can also lead to landslides, hailstorms, and mudslides.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Nkomwa, Emmanuel Charles, Miriam Kalanda Joshua, Cosmo Ngongondo, Maurice Monjerezi, and Felistus Chipungu. "Assessing Indigenous Knowledge Systems and Climate Change Adaptation Strategies in Agriculture: A Case Study of Chagaka Village, Chikhwawa, Southern Malawi." Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, Parts A/B/C 67-69 (2014): 164-72. doi:10.1016/j.pce.2013.10.002.&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure from climate change on Africa is amplified because disaster management infrastructure is nonexistent or severely inadequate throughout the continent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Furthermore, the impact of climate change in Africa falls disproportionately on indigenous people because they have limitations on their migration and mobility, are more negatively affected by decreased biodiversity, and have their agricultural land disproportionately degraded by climate change.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In Malawi, there has been a decrease in yield per unit hectare due to prolonged droughts and inadequate rainfall.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== [[North America]] ===
Impacts of climate change on indigenous actors in North America include temperature increases, precipitation changes, decreased glacier and snow cover, rising sea level, increased floods, droughts and extreme weather.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some of the solutions proposed for combatting climate change in North America like [[coal pollution migitation]], and [[Genetically modified organism|GMO]] foods actually violate the rights of indigenous peoples and ignore what is in their best interest in favor of sustaining economic prosperity in the region.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Furthermore, the loss of biodiversity in the region has severely limited the ability of native people to adapt to changes in their environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== The benefits of indigenous participation in climate change research and governance ==
Historically, indigenous persons have not been included in conversations about climate change and frameworks for them to participate in research have not existed. For example, indigenous people in the Ecuadorian rainforest who had suffered a sharp decrease in biodiversity and an increase of greenhouse gas emissions due to the deforestation of the Amazon were not included in the 2005 Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ([[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation|REDD+]]) project.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Krause, Torsten, Wain Collen, and Kimberly A. Nicholas. "Evaluating Safeguards in a Conservation Incentive Program: Participation, Consent, and Benefit Sharing in Indigenous Communities of the Ecuadorian Amazon." Ecology and Society 18, no. 4 (2013). doi:10.5751/es-05733-180401.&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially difficult for indigenous people because many can perceive changes in their local climate, but struggle with giving reasons for their observed change.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Critics of the program insist that their participation is necessary not only because they believe that it is necessary for social justice reasons but also because indigenous groups are better at protecting their forests than national parks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This place-based knowledge rooted in local cultures, [[Traditional knowledge|indigenous knowledge]] (IK), is useful in determining impacts of climate change, especially at the local level where scientific models often fail.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Chanza, Nelson, and Anton De Wit. "Enhancing Climate Governance through Indigenous Knowledge: Case in Sustainability Science." South African Journal of Science 112, no. 3 (March/April 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, IK plays a crucial part in the rolling-out of new environmental programs because these programs have a higher participation rate and are more effective when indigenous actors have a say in how the programs themselves are shaped.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Thus, including this knowledge in climate change research would lead to further improvements in not only the REDD+ program, but also in the myriad environmental programs that have emerged and will continue to emerge throughout the new millennium.

By extension, governance, especially [[climate governance]], would benefit from an institutional linking to IK because it would hypothetically lead to increased food security.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Such a linkage would also foster a shared sense of responsibility for the usage of the environment's natural resources in a way that is in line with [[sustainable development]] as a whole, but especially with the UN's [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition, taking governance issues to indigenous people, those who are most exposed to climate issues, would build community resilience and increase local sustainability, which would in turn lead to positive ramifications at higher levels.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It is theorized that harnessing the knowledge of indigenous persons on the local level is the most effective way of moving towards global sustainability.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The '''Daylami language''', also known as ''Daylamite'', ''Deilami'', ''Dailamite'', or ''Deylami'' (Deilami: {{lang|fa|دیلمی}}, from the name of the [[Daylam]] region), is an [[extinct language]] that was one of the northwestern branch of the [[Iranian languages]]. It was spoken in northern [[Iran]], specifically in the mountainous area in [[Gilan Province|Gīlān]], [[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]], and [[Qazvin Province|Ghazvin]] Provinces.

[[Parviz Natel Khanlari]] listed this language as one of Iranian dialects spoken between the 9th and 13th centuries. [[Istakhri]], a medieval Iranian geographer, has written about this language, as did [[Al-Muqaddasi]], a medieval Arab geographer, who wrote "they have an obscure language and they use the phoneme ''khe'' /x/ a lot."&lt;ref&gt;Mehdi Marashi, Mohammad Ali Jazayery, Persian studies in North America: studies in honor of Mohammad Ali Jazayery, Ibex Publishers, Inc., 1994, {{ISBN|0-936347-35-X}}, 9780936347356, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; Abū Esḥāq Ṣābī had a similar report on people in the Deylam highlands who spoke a distinct language.&lt;ref&gt;Wilferd Madelung. Abū Isḥāq al-Ṣābī on the Alids of Tabaristān and Gīlān. Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Vol. 26, No. 1 (Jan., 1967), pp. 17-57, [[University of Chicago Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wilfered Madelung, in the early Islamic period the language of the Deylamites was a northwestern Iranian language. One of the characteristics of this language was an added ī sound between consonants and ā ([[Lahijan|Lāhījān]]=Līāhījān, Amīrkā=Amīrkīā).&lt;ref&gt;Wilferd Maelung, Deylamites [http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v7f1/v7f123.html Encyclopedia Iranica]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Directive Communication Psychology''' (DC) is a [[training]] and [[organization development|organisational development]] [[psychology]] developed by [[Arthur F. Carmazzi]] that reveals how people act and react in groups while providing a structure for the influence of those groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://directivecommunication.net/directive-communication-psychology/|title=Fear|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citehr.com/283867-directive-communication-psychology-developing-positive-traits-employees.html|title=Directive Communication Psychology: Developing Positive Traits In The Employees  - CiteHR|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Colored-Brain-Communication-Field-Manual/dp/1442126205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aiobp.org/organization/directive-communication-international/|title=Directive Communication International - AIOBP|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name, "''Directive Communication''", refers to the idea that communication is constant, and, is constantly causing and effecting the individuals and groups involved whether it is verbal or non-verbal. Therefore, understanding the psychological element and derived models of how these cause and effects come about, allows a person to consciously "Direct" his communication to achieve a purposeful and desired effect in group behavior.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carmazzi.net"&gt;http://carmazzi.net/pdf_files/Organizational%20Development%20with%20DC%20psychology%20to%20enhance%20the%20workforce%20and%20develop%2&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The discipline was founded in 2001 when Carmazzi found himself working in a dysfunctional organisation and performing at levels far below his own aptitude. While he was underperforming at work, he found himself to be innovative and perform well with his friends on various projects. He also found that different groups of friends brought out different facets of his attitude and personality, some being positive and others not. His findings were later published as he discovered that an individual’s performance was directly related to the unique group environment he or she was in. The initial work showed some people performed extremely well in one environment and, even with the same requirements, performed poorly in others. The group dynamics studies led the development of the 6 primary models that Carmazzi identified as foundations to understand how different mixes of individuals affect performance differently. The models supported individuals within a group to influence the dynamics and performance of that group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

One of the studies identified how a high achiever was put into a high performing team and the entire team began to perform poorly. In the same study, certain average achievers were combined and created high performing teams.&lt;ref name="directivecommunication.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://directivecommunication.net/team-motivation-connection-clusters|title=Team Motivation Clusters|date=9 April 2014|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="directivecommunication.net"/&gt; In 2007, the methodology was accredited by the American Institute of Business Psychology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

DC Psychology continues to be an expanding discipline with many contributors to the methodology including Lily C. Lau, Dr Raymond Phoon, Dr Leslie Choudhury, Waheed Albalushi, Col. Aalok Soodm Prachla Malhotra and Dr Marine Milad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/11145296/ESTABLISHING_A_BLENDED_LEARNING_ENVIRONMENT_ACCOMMODATING_DIFFERENT_BRAIN_COLOURS_AND_MULTIPLE_INTELLIGENCES|title=ESTABLISHING A BLENDED LEARNING ENVIRONMENT ACCOMMODATING DIFFERENT BRAIN COLOURS AND MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES|first=Marine|last=Milad|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
Directive Communication Psychology is the science of group dynamics. it identifies How and Why people act and react in groups, and the small modifications in behavior that leads to influencing those groups. Directive Communication became the science of organisational peak performance and was commercially applied to developing leadership, improving [[Organizational culture|corporate culture]], [[Team building|Team Development]], workforce enhancement and [[Group dynamics|group behavior modification]], and in high yield training and development. In a non-commercial environment, Directive Communication serves to cultivate better personal relationships, raising children, and becoming more fulfilled and responsible citizens.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

There are 307 Directive Communication certified trainers in 16 different countries including Iran, Pakistan, France, Malaysia, Singapore, Hungary, Bahrain, Qatar, China, UAE and Indonesia among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trainthetrainer.asia/train-the-trainer-enrollment/|title=Train the trainer course by Arthur Carmazzi|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key models==
*Circle of Tolerance – the level of negative stimulus a person can deal with intelligently before reacting.
*Colored Brain - How an individual genetically interprets information and surroundings, gets clarity on solutions, ideas and processes, and, sequencesaction from or through that clarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coloredbrain.com|title=Psychometric Test for Effective Communication with Colored Brain|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Emotional Drive – a set of 8 primary motivators that determine why people take or do not take action and why they react to people and environments in ways that either support or do not support their objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emotionaldrive.net|title=Homepage - HDMA|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Postures – a [[yoga]] based, mind/body connection model that supports the immediate and purposeful creation of mood in an individual to affect environment.
*Directive Questions – a questioning model to take the place of direct instruction in order to connect motivation, develop competence and increase trust and respect within teams.
*Core Identity – a process by which individuals find and nurture their own models of leadership, personal effectiveness and objective supporting attitudes by harnessing facets of who they are at their best in different environments. The model is said to enhance sustainability of new behaviors because in essence, they are not new and simply refined and redirected existing behaviors.

==Organizational culture change model==
The directive communication organizational change model is a bottom up process that was originally derived from the US Special forces and CIA force multiplication and revolution models. The objective of the model is to develop a more effective and engaged organizational culture through uniting the people within the organization to create an environment that supports their personal success and value through the organization, and therefore increasing engagement. It assumes the following points:

*It is easier for the masses to get buy-in from a small group of leaders than it is for a small group of leaders to get buy-in from the masses.
*Groups with a single greater purpose unite to achieve it.
*There are key influencers within an organization that people listen to and respect even if they do not have official titles. These people can influence their peers through trust that may be missing from the employee/management relationship.
*People, regardless of culture, age, position or education have very similar ideas about what is an ideal work environment. (this is based on an [[Arthur Carmazzi]] study conducted over 51 different countries and over 80,000 people determining the fundamental 5 consistent elements that subjects have defined as required for the ideal work environment).
*If there is a common enemy, groups that normally do not associate, will come together to fight against it.
*Ownership of the culture supports perpetuation of it. Employees may not own the company but they can own the culture. A culture initiative must separate the 2 for sustainability.
*In the instant information and gratification society we live in, if people do not see fast results that are supporting their success, they will lose interest and the initiative will get lost in the shuffle of being busy. A successful culture change initiative must show visible results in the first week of implementation to maintain ignite the motivation to continue.
*If given the opportunity, people want to solve the problems that are preventing them from becoming more successful at work. 
*A common language that supports emotional communication without conflict, supports the creation of an ideal working environment 
*The directive communication psychology and it intrinsic language supports the unification of people to achieve the greater common purpose of creating an ideal work environment and show visible results in a short time.

The culture change process has 4 criteria for it to work and be sustainable.

*Senior management must be involved.
*There will be a 2-week period where operations will be disrupted. 
*There may be negative influencers that must be removed from the organization or interaction with the majority of the staff. 
*The initiative only works with up to 1200 people at one time.

==Assumptions of Directive Communication Psychology==
Directive communication psychology has the following assumptions:&lt;ref name="carmazzi.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culture-dynamics.com/main/3180/index.asp?pageid=162466&amp;t=directive-communication-psychology-trainer-certification&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesliechoudhury.com/index.php/directive-communication-psychology|title=Directive Communication Psychology|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/directive-communication-psychology-lenaghaz-lenaghaz-energylab|title=Directive Communication Psychology|date=16 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Individuals have potential to be inspired or uninspired at any given time, depending on their environment and their focus 
*Reactions to environment take place in the reptilian brain, and are a product of violated assumptions about the way that things should be 
*The reptilian brain does not reason and therefore reactions are “non-intelligent” actions 
*By understanding the psychology of how and why people act and react to each other in groups, an individual can change one consistent behavior in an environment, and affect the entire environment. 
*The subconscious actions based on assumptions about the way that people should be, manifest the way others treat them 
*Because of these subconscious actions, Everyone is personally responsible for the way others treat them and the creation of their own environment 
*“Personality” cannot be defined or categorized, it can only be “interpreted” by understanding the 3 separate components of character: the Mental, the Emotional, and the Physical 
*Each person Mentally processes the world around them based on a genetic brain processing, and While we cannot change our genetic processors, we learn “software” to compensate 
*Our Emotional Motivations are driven by eight primary emotional drivers, these are products of our environment and are subject to change over time 
*We have habitual physical postures that affect our focus, attitudes and the way our environment interacts with us.

==Training tools and assessments==
Directive communication psychology training focuses with the idea that learning retention and implementation could be improved with what founder, Arthur Carmazzi, calls “stacked learning”. Using sets of proprietary training tools developed by Carmazzi, a directive communication-based training game incorporates real world context into a specific learning point, the next learning point and game reinforces the earlier one and so on. Each game or exercise for new learning is “stacked” on, and emphasizes each previous learning.
 
This has led to further development of reflective tools such as the Colored Brain Communication Cards: a series of 54 images that, when put in context of a question, elicit subconscious values, lost knowledge, and expanded clarity about the question.

The methodology and tools expand from contributions from its certified trainers and practitioners such as The Choudhury Mind Maze Developed by Dr. Leslie Choudhury that emphasizes 5 out of the 6 Directive Communication models.

The Directive Communication assessments are also related to the various games.

*The Colored Brain Communication Inventory (CBCI) determines the Colored Brain or specific genetic process for getting clarity of a user.
*The Human Drive Mirrored Assessment (HDMA) identifies the “perception gaps” of how an individual sees themselves compared to how they are seen be subordinates, peers and superiors 
*The Corporate Culture Evolution Evaluation (CCEE) determining at which of the five levels of organizational culture (according to Carmazzi’s Culture Model) an organization’s culture is at.

Assessments are also subject to expansion from the Directive Communication community with contributions to accuracy and further application. One contribution by Lily C. Lau expanded the practicality of the Colored Brain assessment by adding depth to the application of “the second color” with her own research in 2013.

==Applications==
* Leadership
* Team effectiveness
* Engagement 
* Organizational culture enhancement and change
* Sales and marketing
* Customer service
* Training and learning effectivness

==Certification, and practitioner standards==
There are two maincertifications, “trainer” and “practitioner”. Additional certifications such as culture change, gamification, and master trainer,must have a minimum trainer certification before they can be attained. As an accredited methodology from the American Institute of Business Psychology, the Directive Communication psychology trainer certification is subject to two examinations. A practical examination where no more than 3 out of 50 questions can be missed for a passing grade, and a practical for the psychology based delivery methods related to training and increasing retention and implementation of concepts. Trainer certifications can only be delivered and certified by official Directive Communication Certified Master Trainers.

The practitioner certification is available live by certified Directive Communication master trainers and in online format. It is a prerequisite for the trainer certification. The practitioner certification requires only passing a written test with 20 questions per module and cannot miss more than 2 out of 20. The test is taken online.

'''Ecuadorians''' are people identified with [[Ecuador]], a country in [[South America]], its citizens or their descendants abroad who identify with the [[Ecuadorian culture]] and descent. Ecuador is a multiethnic society, a home to people of various ethnic origins; as a result, Ecuadorians do not equate their nationality with their ethnicity, but rather their allegiance or affinity for Ecuador. Majority of Ecuadorians trace their origins to one or more of three geographical sources of [[human migration]]s to the territory of modern Ecuador: the [[pre-Hispanic]] [[Pre-Columbian South America|indigenous populations]] who settled the region over 15,000 years ago, the [[European ethnic groups|European]]s (principally [[Spaniards]] which are also the source of the [[Spanish language]]) who arrived over five centuries ago, and ultimately the [[Black Ecuadorians|sub-Saharan Africans]] who were imported to [[New Spain]] as [[slaves]] during the same period. The mixing of two or more of these three groups established other mixed ethnic groups.

''[[Mestizo]]s'', the multiracial group of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry, are by far the largest of all the ethnic groups and comprise around 71.9% of the current population. [[White people|Whites]] are estimated at 6.1% and consist largely of those of unmixed or predominant European descent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eluniverso.com/2011/09/02/1/1356/poblacion-pais-joven-mestiza-dice-censo-inec.html Población del país es joven y mestiza, dice censo del INEC]. (Census results, in Spanish) eluniverso.com (2011-09-02)&lt;/ref&gt; Most white Ecuadorians are of colonial-era Spanish origin, also known as ''[[criollo people|criollos]]'' (literally meaning "local-born Spaniards", as opposed to "[[Peninsulares]]", which were Spaniards born in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in Spain. They also include descendants of immigrants from Italy, Germany, and France, as well as other countries.  The third most numerous group are the indigenous [[Amerindians]], who account for approximately 7% of the population. [[Afro-Ecuadorian people|Afro-Ecuadorians]] make up most of the balance of the percentage and include [[mulattos]] (mixed European and sub-Saharan African) and [[zambos]] (mixed indigenous and sub-Saharan African).

===Census data===
The '''Ecuadorian census''' is conducted by the [[Politics of Ecuador|governmental institution]] known as ''INEC'', ''Instituto Nacional de Estadisticas y Censos'' (National Institute of Statistics and Census).&lt;ref name="inec.gob.ec"&gt;INEC https://web.archive.org/web/20110201014932/http://www.inec.gob.ec/preliminares/somos.html&lt;/ref&gt; The census in Ecuador is conducted every ten years, and its objective is to obtain the number of people residing within its borders. The current census now includes household information.

The most recent census (as of 2011) emphasized reaching rural and remote areas to map the most accurate population count in the country. The 2010 census was conducted in November and December, and its results were published 27 January 2011.

===Geography===
Due to the prevalence of [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]] in the coastal region until the end of the 19th century, the Ecuadorian population was most heavily concentrated in the highlands and valleys of the "Sierra" region. Today's population is distributed more evenly between the "Sierra" and the "Costa" (the coastal lowlands)region. Migration towards the cities—particularly larger cities—in all regions has increased the urban population to about 55 percent.

The "Oriente" region, consisting of Amazonian lowlands to the East of the Andes and covering about half the country's land area, remains sparsely populated and contains only about 3% of the country's population, that for the most are indigenous peoples who maintain a wary distance from the recent mestizo and white settlers. The territories of the "Oriente" are home to as many as nine indigenous groups: [[Quichua]], [[Shuar people|Shuar]], [[Achuar people|Achuar]], [[Huaorani]], [[Siona people|Siona]], [[Siona people|Secoya]], [[Shiwiar]], and [[Cofan]], all represented politically by the [[CONFENIAE|Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon, CONFENIAE]].

As a result of the oil exploration and the development of the infrastructure required for the exploitation of the oil fields in the eastern jungles during the seventies and early eighties, there was a wave of settlement in the region. The Majority of these wave of internal immigration came from the southern province of Loja as a result of a drought that lasted three years and affected the southern provinces of the country. This boom of the petroleum industry has led to a mushrooming of the town of [[Lago Agrio]] ([[Nueva Loja]]) as well as substantial [[deforestation]] and pollution of wetlands and lakes.

==Nationality, ethnicity, and race==
There are five major '''ethnic groups in Ecuador''': [[mestizo]], [[White Latin American|white]], [[Afroecuatoriano|Afroecuadorian]], [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador|Amerindian]], and Montubio.  Mestizos constitute more than 70% of the population.

[[Ecuador]]'s population descends from [[History of ecuador#Spanish discovery and conquest|Spanish immigrants]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous South American Indians]], admixed with descendants of black slaves who arrived to work on coastal plantations in the sixteenth century. The mix of these groups is described as [[mestizo]] or [[cholo]]. Censuses do not record ethnic affiliation, which in any event remains fluid; thus, estimates of the numbers of each group should be taken only as approximations. In the 1980s, Indians and mestizos represented the bulk of the population, with each group accounting for roughly 40 percent of total population. Whites represented 10 to 15 percent and blacks the remaining 5 percent.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;{{csref|country=ecuador|section=Ethnic Groups|author=Patricia Kluck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kluck, writing in 1989, ethnic groups in Ecuador have had a traditional hierarchy of white, [[mestizo]], blacks, and then others.&lt;ref name=whites&gt;{{csref | country = ecuador| section = Whites and Mestizos| author  = Patricia Kluck}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her review depicts this hierarchy as a consequence of colonial attitudes and of the terminology of colonial legal distinctions. Spanish-born persons residing in the New World (peninsulares) were at the top of the social hierarchy, followed by [[criollo people|criollos]], born of two Spanish parents in the colonies. The 19th century usage of mestizo was to denote a person whose parents were an Indian and a white; a [[cholo]] had one Indian and one mestizo parent. By the 20th century, mestizo and cholo were frequently used interchangeably. Kluck suggested that societal relationships, occupation, manners, and clothing all derived from ethnic affiliation.&lt;ref name=whites/&gt;

Nonetheless, according to Kluck, individuals could potentially switch ethnic affiliation if they had culturally adapted to the recipient group; such switches were made without resort to subterfuge.&lt;ref name=whites/&gt; Moreover, the precise criteria for defining ethnic groups varies considerably. The vocabulary that more prosperous mestizos and whites used in describing ethnic groups mixes social and biological characteristics. Ethnic affiliation thus is dynamic; Indians often become mestizos, and prosperous mestizos seek to improve their status sufficiently to be considered whites. Ethnic identity reflects numerous characteristics, only one of which is physical appearance; others include dress, language, community membership, and self-identification.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt;

A geography of ethnicity remained well-defined until the surge in migration that began in the 1950s. Whites resided primarily in larger cities. Mestizos lived in small towns scattered throughout the countryside. Indians formed the bulk of the Sierra rural populace, although mestizos filled this role in the areas with few Indians. Most blacks lived in [[Esmeraldas Province]], with small enclaves found in the Carchi and Imbabura provinces. Pressure on Sierra land resources and the dissolution of the traditional hacienda, however, increased the numbers of Indians migrating to the Costa, the Oriente, and the cities. By the 1980s, Sierra Indians—or Indians in the process of switching their ethnic identity to that of mestizos—lived on Costa plantations, in Quito, Guayaquil, and other cities, and in colonization areas in the Oriente and the Costa. Indeed, Sierra Indians residing in the coastal region substantially outnumbered the remaining original Costa inhabitants, the Cayapa and Colorado Indians. In the late 1980s, analysts estimated that there were only about 4,000 Cayapas and Colorados. Some blacks had migrated from the remote region of the Ecuadorian-Colombian border to the towns and cities of Esmeraldas.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt;

===Afro-Ecuadorian===
{{Main|Afro-Ecuadorian people}}
Afro-Ecuadorians are an [[ethnic group]] in Ecuador who are descendants of black African slaves brought by the Spanish during their conquest of Ecuador from the [[Inca]]s. They make up from 3% to 5% of Ecuador's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ec.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/rough/2010/06/ecuador_dreamto.html|title=FRONTLINE/WORLD . Rough Cut . Ecuador: Dreamtown – PBS|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecuador has a population of about 1,120,000 descendants from African people. The Afro-Ecuadorian culture is found primarily in the country's northwest coastal region. Africans form a majority (70%) in the province of [[Esmeraldas Province|Esmeraldas]] and also have an important concentration in the [[Valle del Chota]] in the [[Imbabura Province]]. They can be also found in important numbers in [[Quito]] and [[Guayaquil]].

=== Indigenous ===
{{Main|Indigenous peoples in Ecuador}}

====Sierra Indians====
[[File:EquateurOtavalo 0606.jpg|thumb|left|[[Otavalo people|Otavalo]] girl from Ecuador]]
Sierra Indians had an estimated population of 1.5 to 2 million in the early 1980s and live in the intermontane valleys of the Andes. Prolonged contact with Hispanic culture, which dates back to the conquest, has had a homogenizing effect, reducing the variation among the indigenous Sierra tribes.&lt;ref name=sierra&gt;{{csref
| country = ecuador
| section = Sierra Indians
| author  = Patricia Kluck
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indians of the Sierra are separated from whites and mestizos by a castelike gulf. They are marked as a disadvantaged group; to be an Indian or indígena in Ecuador is to be stigmatized. Indians are usually poor and frequently illiterate, they enjoy limited participation in national institutions, and they command access to few of the social and economic opportunities available to more privileged groups.&lt;ref name=sierra/&gt;

Visible markers of ethnic affiliation, especially hairstyle, dress, and language, separate Indians from the rest of the populace. Indians wore more manufactured items by the late 1970s than previously; their clothing, nonetheless, was distinct from that of other rural inhabitants. Indians in communities relying extensively on wage labor sometimes assumed Western-style dress while still maintaining their Indian identity. Indians speak Quichua—a Quechua dialect—although most are bilingual, speaking Spanish as a second language with varying degrees of facility. By the late 1980s, some younger Indians no longer learned Quichua.&lt;ref name=sierra/&gt;

====Oriente Indians====
[[File:Huaorani village.jpg|left|thumb|[[Huaorani]] village]]
Although the Indians of the Oriente first came into contact with whites in the 16th century, the encounters were more sporadic than those of most of the country's indigenous population. Until the 19th century, most non-Indians entering the region were either traders or missionaries. Beginning in the 1950s, however, the government built roads and encouraged settlers from the Sierra to colonize the Amazon River Basin. Virtually all remaining Indians were brought into increasing contact with national society. The interaction between Indians and outsiders had a profound impact on the indigenous way of life.&lt;ref name=oriente&gt;{{csref
| country = ecuador
| section = Oriente Indians
| author  = Patricia Kluck
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, roughly 30,000 Quichua speakers and 15,000 Jívaros lived in Oriente Indian communities. Quichua speakers (sometimes referred to as the Yumbos) grew out of the detribalization of members of many different groups after the Spanish conquest. Subject to the influence of Quichua-speaking missionaries and traders, various elements of the Yumbos adopted the tongue as a lingua franca and gradually lost their previous languages and tribal origins. Yumbos were scattered throughout the Oriente, whereas the Jívaros—subdivided into the Shuar and the Achuar—were concentrated in southeastern Ecuador. Some also lived in northeastern Peru. Traditionally, both groups relied on migration to resolve intracommunity conflict and to limit the ecological damage to the tropical forest caused by slash-and-burn agriculture.&lt;ref name=oriente/&gt;

Both the Yumbos and the Jívaros depended on agriculture as their primary means of subsistence. [[Manioc]], the main staple, was grown in conjunction with a wide variety of other fruits and vegetables. Yumbo men also resorted to wage labor to obtain cash for the few purchases deemed necessary. By the mid-1970s, increasing numbers of Quichua speakers settled around some of the towns and missions of the Oriente. Indians themselves had begun to make a distinction between Christian and jungle Indians. The former engaged in trade with townspeople. The Jívaros, in contrast to the Christian Quichua speakers, lived in more remote areas. Their mode of horticulture was similar to that of the non-Christian Yumbos, although they supplemented crop production with hunting and some livestock raising.&lt;ref name=oriente/&gt;

Shamans ([[curandero]]s) played a pivotal role in social relations in both groups. As the main leaders and the focus of local conflicts, shamans were believed to both cure and kill through magical means. In the 1980s group conflicts between rival shamans still erupted into full-scale feuds with loss of life.&lt;ref name=oriente/&gt;

The Oriente Indian population dropped precipitously during the initial period of intensive contact with outsiders. The destruction of their crops by mestizos laying claim to indigenous lands, the rapid exposure to diseases to which Indians lacked immunity, and the extreme social disorganization all contributed to increased mortality and decreased birth rates. One study of the Shuar in the 1950s found that the group between ten and nineteen years of age was smaller than expected. This was the group that had been youngest and most vulnerable during the initial contact with national society. Normal population growth rates began to reestablish themselves after approximately the first decade of such contact.&lt;ref name=oriente/&gt;

==Culture==

{{Main|Culture of Ecuador}}

Ecuador's mainstream culture is defined by its Hispanic ''[[mestizo]]'' majority, and like their ancestry, it is traditionally of Spanish heritage, influenced in different degrees by Amerindian traditions, and in some cases by African elements. The first and most substantial wave of modern immigration to Ecuador consisted of Spanish colonists, following the arrival of Europeans in 1499. A lower number of other Europeans and North Americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and in smaller numbers, Poles, Lithuanians, English, Irish, and Croats during and after the Second World War.

Since African slavery was not the workforce of the Spanish colonies in the Andes Mountains of South America, given the subjugation of the indigenous people through evangelism and ''[[encomiendas]]'', the minority population of African descent is mostly found in the coastal northern province of Esmeraldas. This is largely owing to the 17th century shipwreck of a slave-trading galleon off the northern coast of Ecuador.{{dubious| date=May 2015}}

Ecuador's indigenous communities are integrated into the mainstream culture to varying degrees,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080502041028/http://www.south-images.com/photos-andes-ecuador.htm South-images.com] ''Photos Indigenous people of Ecuador''&lt;/ref&gt; but some may also practice their own indigenous cultures, particularly the more remote indigenous communities of the [[Amazon basin]]. Spanish is spoken as the first language by more than 90% of the population, and as a first or second language by more than 98%. Part of Ecuador's population can speak [[Amerindian]] languages, in some cases as a second language. Two percent of the population speak only Amerindian languages.

===Language===
Most Ecuadorians speak Spanish, though many speak Amerindian languages such as [[Kichwa]]. Other Amerindian languages spoken in Ecuador include Awapit (spoken by the Awá), A'ingae (spoken by the Cofan), Shuar Chicham (spoken by the Shuar), Achuar-Shiwiar (spoken by the Achuar and the Shiwiar), Cha'palaachi (spoken by the Chachi), Tsa'fiki (spoken by the Tsáchila), Paicoca (spoken by the Siona and Secoya), and Wao Tededeo (spoken by the Waorani). Though most features of Ecuadorian Spanish are those universal to the Spanish-speaking world, there are several idiosyncrasies.

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in Ecuador}}
According to the Ecuadorian National Institute of Statistics and Census, 91.95% of the country's population have a religion, 7.94% are [[Atheism|atheists]] and 0.11% are agnostics. Among those with a religion, 80.44% are [[Roman Catholic]], 11.30% are [[Protestants]], and 8.26% other (mainly Jewish, Buddhists and Latter-day Saints).&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.lahora.com.ec/index.php/noticias/show/1101377532/-1/El_80%25_de_ecuatorianos_es_cat%C3%B3lico.html#.UGyc6k3LQ5w El 80% de ecuatorianos es católico] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811033609/http://www.lahora.com.ec/index.php/noticias/show/1101377532/-1/El_80%25_De_ecuatorianos_es_cat%C3%B3lico.html#.UGyc6k3LQ5w |date=11 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.eluniverso.com/2012/08/15/1/1382/80-ecuatorianos-afirma-ser-catolico-segun-inec.html El 80% de los ecuatorianos afirma ser católico, según el INEC]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the rural parts of Ecuador, indigenous beliefs and Catholicism are sometimes [[syncretism|syncretized]]. Most festivals and annual parades are based on religious celebrations, many incorporating a mixture of rites and icons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gmGADAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA136&amp;ots=COBWXWLfTR&amp;dq=Ecuador,%20indigenous%20beliefs%20and%20Catholicism%20are%20sometimes%20syncretized&amp;pg=PA136#v=onepage&amp;q=Ecuador,%20indigenous%20beliefs%20and%20Catholicism%20are%20sometimes%20syncretized&amp;f=false|title=Latin American Business Cultures|last=Crane|first=R.|last2=Rizowy|first2=C.|date=2010-12-08|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9780230299108|location=|pages=136|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a small number of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christians]], indigenous religions, Muslims (see [[Islam in Ecuador]]), [[Buddhist]]s and [[Bahá'í]]s.

The "Jewish Community of Ecuador" (Comunidad Judía del Ecuador) has its seat in [[Quito]] and has approximately 300 members. Nevertheless, this number is declining because young people leave the country towards the United States of America or Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cje-ec.com/inter.asp?s=2&amp;id=e/ Ecuadorian Jewish Community]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220125124/http://www.cje-ec.com/inter.asp?s=2&amp;id=e%2F |date=20 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Community has a Jewish Center with a synagogue, a country club and a cemetery.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Ecuador}}
[[File:Julio jaramillo laurido2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Julio Jaramillo]] is an icon of music.]]
The music of Ecuador has a long history. [[Pasillo]] is a genre of indigenous Latin music. In Ecuador it is the "national genre of music." Through the years, many cultures have influenced to establish new types of music. There are also different kinds of traditional music like albazo, pasacalle, fox incaico, tonada, capishca, [[Bomba (Ecuador)|Bomba]] highly established in afro-Ecuadorian society like [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador|Esmeraldas]], and so on.

[[Tecnocumbia]] and Rockola are clear examples of foreign cultures' influence. One of the most traditional forms of dancing in Ecuador is Sanjuanito. It is originally from the North of Ecuador ([[Otavalo people|Otavalo]]-Imbabura). Sanjuanito is a danceable music used in the festivities of the mestizo and indigenous culture. According to the Ecuadorian musicologist Segundo Luis Moreno, Sanjuanito was danced by indigenous people during San Juan Bautista's birthday. This important date was established by the Spaniards on 24 June, coincidentally the same date when indigenous people celebrated their rituals of [[Inti Raymi]].

===Cuisine===
[[File:Ceviche ecuador.JPG|thumb|left|Ecuadorian ''[[ceviche]]'', made of shrimp and lemon, onions and some herbs. Tomato sauce and orange are used at some places, but does not form a part of the basic recipe.]]
[[Ecuadorian cuisine]] is diverse, varying with the altitude and associated agricultural conditions. Most regions in Ecuador follow the traditional three course meal of soup, a second course which includes rice and a protein such as meat or fish, and then dessert and coffee to finish. Supper is usually lighter, and sometimes consists only of coffee or herbal tea with bread.

In the highland region, pork, chicken, beef, and ''cuy'' (guinea pig) are popular and are served with a variety of grains (especially rice and corn) or potatoes.

In the coastal region, seafood is very popular, with fish, shrimp and ''[[ceviche]]'' being key parts of the diet. Generally, ceviches are served with fried plantain ([[chifle]]s y patacones), popcorn or [[corn nut|tostado]]. [[Plantain (cooking)|Plantain]]- and peanut-based dishes are the basis of most coastal meals. Encocados (dishes that contain a coconut sauce) are also very popular. ''[[Churrasco]]'' is a staple food of the coastal region, especially [[Guayaquil]]. ''Arroz con menestra y carne asada'' (rice with beans and grilled beef) is one of the traditional dishes of Guayaquil, as is [[Tostones|fried plantain]] which is often served with it. This region is a leading producer of bananas, cacao beans (to make chocolate), shrimp, tilapia, mangos and passion fruit, among other products.

In the Amazon region, a dietary staple is the ''yuca'', elsewhere called [[cassava]]. Many fruits are available in this region, including bananas, tree grapes, and peach palms.

=== Literature ===
[[File:Jmontalvo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Juan Montalvo]]]]

Early literature in colonial Ecuador, as in the rest of Spanish America, was influenced by the [[Spanish Golden Age]]. One of the earliest examples is [[Jacinto Collahuazo]],&lt;ref name =Boceto&gt;Borja,Piedad. [http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/ALHI/article/viewFile/ALHI7272110053A/25162 Boceto de Poesía Ecuatoriana,'Journal de la Academia de Literatura Hispanoamericana', 1972]&lt;/ref&gt; an indigenous chief of a northern village in today's Ibarra, born in the late 1600s. Despite the early repression and discrimination of the native people by the Spanish, Collahuazo learned to read and write in [[Spanish language|Castilian]], but his work was written in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]. The use of the [[Quipu]] was banned by the Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, W.S., ''History of the Latin-American Nations'', 1952&lt;/ref&gt; and in order to preserve their work, many Inca poets had to resort to the use of the Latin alphabet to write in their native Quechua language. The history behind the Inca drama "Ollantay", the oldest literary piece in existence for any indigenous language in America,&lt;ref&gt;Karnis, ''Surviving Pre-Columbian Drama'', The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1952&lt;/ref&gt; shares some similarities with the work of Collahuazo. Collahuazo was imprisoned, and all of his work burned. The existence of his literary work came to light many centuries later, when a crew of masons was restoring the walls of a colonial church in Quito, and found a hidden manuscript. The salvaged fragment is a Spanish translation from Quechua of the "Elegy to the Dead of Atahualpa",&lt;ref name =Boceto/&gt; a poem written by Collahuazo, which describes the sadness and impotence of the Inca people of having lost their king Atahualpa.

Other early Ecuadorian writers include the Jesuits [[Juan Bautista Aguirre]], born in [[Daule Canton|Daule]] in 1725, and Father [[Juan de Velasco]], born in Riobamba in 1727. De Velasco wrote about the nations and chiefdoms that had existed in the ''Kingdom of Quito'' (today Ecuador) before the arrival of the Spanish. His historical accounts are nationalistic, featuring a romantic perspective of precolonial history.

Famous authors from the late colonial and early republic period include: [[Eugenio Espejo]] a printer and main author of the first newspaper in Ecuadorian colonial times; [[Jose Joaquin de Olmedo]] (born in Guayaquil), famous for his ode to [[Simón Bolívar]] titled [[La victoria de Junin|''La Victoria de Junin'']]; [[Juan Montalvo]], a prominent essayist and novelist; [[Juan Leon Mera]], famous for his work "Cumanda" or "Tragedy among Savages" and the Ecuadorian National Anthem; [[Luis A. Martínez]] with ''A la Costa'', [[Dolores Veintimilla]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=DOC|first=Dolores|last=Veintimilla|url=http://teachers.cmsfq.edu.ec/high/Assignments/D%C3%A9cimo%20Primer%20Grado/AP%20Spanish%20Language%20-%20D%20-%20Diego%20Chauvin/Dolores_Veintimilla_de_Ga%5B1%5D.doc|title=Dolores Veintimilla de Galindo|language=es|website=cmsfq.edu.ec|date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425092612/http://teachers.cmsfq.edu.ec/high/Assignments/D%C3%A9cimo%20Primer%20Grado/AP%20Spanish%20Language%20-%20D%20-%20Diego%20Chauvin/Dolores_Veintimilla_de_Ga%5B1%5D.doc|archivedate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

===Art===
The best known art styles from Ecuador belonged to the ''[[Escuela Quiteña]]'', which developed from the 16th to 18th centuries, examples of which are on display in various old churches in Quito. [[Ecuadorian painters]] include: [[Eduardo Kingman]], [[Oswaldo Guayasamín]] and [[Camilo Egas]] from the Indiginist Movement; [[Manuel Rendon]], [[Jaime Zapata]], [[Enrique Tábara]], [[Aníbal Villacís]], [[Theo Constante]], León Ricaurte and [[Estuardo Maldonado]] from the Informalist Movement; and [[Luis Burgos Flor]] with his abstract, Futuristic style.

The most popular [[sport in Ecuador]], as in most South American countries, is football (soccer). Its best known professional teams include [[Barcelona Sporting Club|Barcelona]] and [[Club Sport Emelec|Emelec]] from [[Guayaquil]]; [[Liga Deportiva Universitaria de Quito|LDU Quito]], [[Sociedad Deportivo Quito|Deportivo Quito]], and [[Club Deportivo El Nacional|El Nacional]] from Quito; [[Centro Deportivo Olmedo|Olmedo]] from [[Riobamba]]; and [[Club Deportivo Cuenca|Deportivo Cuenca]] from Cuenca. Currently the most successful football club in Ecuador is [[LDU Quito]], and it is the only Ecuadorian club that have won the ''[[Copa Libertadores]]'', the ''[[Copa Sudamericana]]'' and the ''[[Recopa Sudamericana]]''; they were also runners-up in the [[2008 FIFA Club World Cup]]. The matches of the [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuadorian national team]] are the most-watched sporting events in the country. Ecuador qualified for the final rounds of both the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s. The 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign was considered a huge success for the country and its inhabitants. Ecuador finished in 2nd place on the qualifiers behind [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and above the team that would become World Champion, [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Ecuador finished ahead of [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] to come in second to [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in Group A in the 2006 World Cup. [[Futsal]], often referred to as ''índor'', is particularly popular for mass participation.

There is considerable interest in tennis in the middle and upper classes of Ecuadorian society, and several Ecuadorian professional players have attained international fame. Basketball has a high profile, while Ecuador's specialties include [[Ecuavolley]], a three-person variation of volleyball. Bullfighting is practiced at a professional level in Quito, during the annual festivities that commemorate the Spanish founding of the city, and it also features in festivals in many smaller towns. [[Rugby union]] is found to some extent in Ecuador, with teams in Guayaquil, Quito and Cuenca.

Ecuador has won only two medals in the Olympic Games, both gained by 20&amp;nbsp;km racewalker [[Jefferson Pérez]], who took gold in the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] games, and silver [[2008 Summer Olympics|12 years later]]. Pérez also set a world best in the 2003 World Championships of 1:17:21 for the 20&amp;nbsp;km distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people2people.org/voices/s_e/perez.html |title=The pride of Ecuador |publisher=Synergos.org |date=14 August 1996 |accessdate=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration trends==
{{See also|1998–99 Ecuador banking crisis}}
{{More citations needed|date=November 2010}}

In recent decades, there has been a high rate of emigration due to the [[1998–99 Ecuador banking crisis|economic crisis]] that seriously affected the economy of the country in the 1990s, over 400,000 Ecuadorians left for [[Ecuadorians in Spain|Spain]] and [[Ecuadorians in Italy|Italy]], and around 100,000 for the [[Ecuadorians in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] while several hundred thousand Ecuadorians live in the US, (500,000 by some estimates) mostly in the cities of the Northeastern corridor. Many other Ecuadorians have emigrated across Latin America, thousands have gone to Japan and Australia. One famous American of [[Ecuadorian American|Ecuadorian]] descent is pop music vocalist [[Christina Aguilera]].

In Ecuador there are about 100,000 Americans and over 30,000 [[European Union]] expatriates. They move to Ecuador for business opportunities and as cheaper place for retirement.

As a result of the political conflict in [[Colombia]] and of the criminal gangs that had appeared in the areas of power vacuum a constant flow of refugees and asylum seekers as well as economic migrants of [[Colombian people|Colombian origin]] had moved into Ecuadorian territory. Over the last decade at least 45,000 displaced people are now residents in Ecuador, the Ecuadorian government and international organizations are assisting them. According to the [[UNHCR]] 2009 report as many as 167,189 [[refugee]]s and [[asylum seekers]] are temporary residents in Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=ZIP |url=http://www.unhcr.org/globaltrends/2009-Global-Tends-annex.zip |title=Table 1. Refugees, asylum-seekers, internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees (refugees and IDPs), stateless persons, and others of concern to UNHCR by country/territory of asylum, end-2009 |work=[[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] |date=2009 |accessdate=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the migratory trend to Europe many of the jobs that those that left held in the country had been taken over by Peruvian [[economic migrants]]. Those jobs are mostly in agriculture and unskilled labor. There are no official statistics but some press reports estimate their number into the tens of thousands.

There is a diverse community of [[Middle Eastern peoples|Middle Eastern]] Ecuadorians, numbering in the tens of thousands, mostly from [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Syrians|Syrian]] and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] descent; prominent in commerce and industry, and concentrated in the coastal cities of [[Guayaquil]], [[Quevedo, Ecuador|Quevedo]] and [[Machala]]. They are well assimilated into the local culture and are referred commonly as "[[Turkish people|turcos]]" since the early migrants of these communities arrived with passports issued by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the beginning of the century.
'''See also:''' [[Lebanese people in Ecuador]].

Ecuador is also home to communities of [[Spaniards]], Italians, [[Germans]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], French, [[British people|Britons]] and [[Greeks|Greek]]-Ecuadorians. Ecuadorian [[Jews]], who number around 450 are mostly of German or Italian descent. There are 225,000 English speakers and 112,000 German speakers in Ecuador of which the great majority reside in [[Quito]], mainly all descendants of immigrants who arrived in the late 19th century and of retired emigrees that returned to their terroir. Most of the descendants of European immigrants strive for the preservation of their heritage. Therefore, some groups even have their own schools (e.g. [[German School Guayaquil]] and German School Quito), Liceé La Condamine (French Heritage), Alberto Einstein (Jewish Heritage) and [[The British School of Quito]] (Anglo-British), cultural and social organizations, churches and country clubs. Their contribution for the social, political and economical development of the country is immense, specially in relation to their percentage in the total population. Most of the families of European heritage belong to the Ecuadorian upper class and had married into the wealthiest families of the country.

There is also a small Asian-Ecuadorian (see [[Asian Latino]]) community estimated in a range from 2,500 to 25,000, mainly consists of those having any amount of [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] [[Yun'an District|Yunan]] and [[Han Chinese|Han]] descent, and possibly 10,000 being Japanese whose ancestors arrived as miners, farm hands and fishermen in the late 19th century. [[Guayaquil]] has an [[East Asian]] community, mostly Chinese including Taiwanese, Filipinos and Japanese.

{{About|the children of the King of France|the 17th century female immigrants to Quebec|Les filles du roi|the film|Son of France}}
'''''Fils de France''''' ({{IPA-fr|fis də fʁɑ̃s}}, ''Son of France'') was the [[style (manner of address)|style]] and [[Ranks of nobility and peerage|rank]] held by the sons of the [[French monarchy|kings]] and [[Dauphin of France|dauphins]] of France. A daughter was known as a '''fille de France''' ({{IPA-fr|fij də fʁɑ̃s}}, ''Daughter of France'').

The children of the dauphin (a title reserved for the king's [[heir apparent]] whether son, grandson or great-grandson of the monarch) were accorded the same style and status as if they were the king's children instead of his grandchildren or great-grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Spanheim|first= Ézéchiel|authorlink=Ezekiel, Freiherr von Spanheim|editor= [[Émile Bourgeois]]|title= Relation de la Cour de France|series= le Temps retrouvé|year = 1973|publisher=Mercure de France|location= [[Paris]]|language= French|page= 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crown of a Royal Prince of the Blood of France (variant).svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Heraldic crown]] of a Fils de France.]]

==Styles==

The king, queen, [[queen dowager]], ''enfants de France'' (children of France) and ''petits-enfants de France'' (grandchildren of France) constituted the ''famille du roi'' (royal family).&lt;ref&gt;ib. Spanheim, Ézéchiel, pp. 81, 87, 313-314.&lt;/ref&gt; More remote legitimate, [[patrilineality|male-line]] descendants of France's kings held the designation and rank of ''[[Prince du Sang|princes du sang]]'' (princes of the blood) or, if legally recognised despite a [[baton sinister#Bar sinister|bar sinister]] on the [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]], they were customarily deemed ''princes légitimés'' (legitimated princes).&lt;ref&gt;ib. Spanheim, Ézéchiel, pp. 100-105, 323-327.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dauphin, the heir to the French throne, was the most senior of the ''fils de France'' and was usually addressed as ''[[Monsieur]] le dauphin''.&lt;ref name = velde1/&gt; The king's next younger brother, also a ''fils de France'', was known simply as ''[[Monsieur]]'', and his wife as ''[[Madame]]''.&lt;ref&gt;ib. Spanheim, Ézéchiel, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daughters were referred to by their given name prefaced with the [[honorific]] ''Madame'', while sons were referred to by their main [[French peerage|peerage]] title (usually [[Duke|ducal]]), with the exception of the dauphin. The king's eldest daughter was known as ''[[Madame Royale]]'' until she married, whereupon the next eldest ''fille de France'' succeeded to that style.

Although the children of monarchs are often referred to in English as ''prince'' or ''princess'', those terms were used as general descriptions for royalty in France but not as titular prefixes or direct forms of address for individuals (with the exception of ''Monsieur le Prince'' for the senior ''[[prince du sang]]'') prior to the [[July Monarchy]] (1830–1848). Collectively, the [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimate]] children of the kings and dauphins were known as ''enfants de France'' ("children of France"), while examples abound in reputable works of ''fils de France'' and ''fille de France'' being converted into other languages as "Prince/Princess of France" (however the same works, as cited, leave the Spanish equivalent, ''[[infante|Infante/Infanta de España]])'', untranslated.&lt;ref&gt;The Descendants of Louis XIII. Daniel Willis. 1999, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Band VIII. C.A. Starke. 1968, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Le Royaume d'Italie, vol. 1. C.E.D.R.E. 1992, p.131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L'Allemagne Dynastique, tome V. Michel Huberty. 1988, p. 572&lt;/ref&gt; The illegitimate children of French kings, dauphins, and ''princes du sang'' were not entitled to any rights or styles ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]'', but often they were [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimised]] by their fathers. Even then, however, they were never elevated to the rank of ''fils de France'', although they were sometimes accorded the lower rank and/or privileges associated with the ''[[Prince du Sang|princes du sang]]''.

All ''enfants de France'' were entitled to the style of [[Royal Highness]] (''altesse royale'') from the reign of Louis XIII.&lt;ref name = velde&gt;{{cite web| last = Velde| first = François| title = The French Royal Family: Titles and Customs&amp;nbsp;— Formal Styles|work = Heraldica.org| url = http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/frroyal.htm#formal|accessdate = 2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice that formal honorific was less often used than the more traditionally French styles of ''Monsieur, Madame'' or ''Mademoiselle''.&lt;ref name = velde1&gt;{{cite web| last = Velde| first = François| title = The French Royal Family: Titles and Customs&amp;nbsp;— Forms of Address|work = Heraldica.org| url = http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/frroyal.htm#formal| accessdate = 2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = velde/&gt; The styles of the royal family varied as follows:

==Titles==
Under the Valois monarchs, the titles borne by the sons of kings became regularized. [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]] made his eldest son ''Duke of Normandy'' and his second son ''Duke of Orléans''. Normandy would have become the regular title of the heirs apparent of kings, but the acquisition of [[Dauphiné]] and the request of its last count ensured that the heirs apparent would be called ''Dauphin'' instead.

[[John II of France|John II]] made his eldest son Duke of Normandy, and his younger sons dukes of Anjou, Berry, and Burgundy. Anjou and Burgundy established long-lived dynasties, while the Duke of Berry lived for a long time. Orléans was reused for the younger son of [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], while Berry was reused for the younger son of [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]]. By the accession of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], all of the cadet branches descended from Valois kings had either succeeded to the throne or become extinct. Thus the king had a wide selection of traditional titles to choose from. Orléans was the most preferred, followed by Anjou.

The Bourbon kings followed the traditional titling, with Berry used for the third son. As lifespans extended, Burgundy was used for the eldest son of the Dauphin, and Brittany for the eldest son of the eldest son of the Dauphin. But as fortune would have it, only the title of Orléans would be transmitted hereditarily until the Revolution.

==Monsieur le Dauphin==
This was a form of address for the dauphin. The ''dauphin de France'' (strictly-speaking the [[dauphin de Viennois]]), was the title used for the [[heir apparent]] to the throne of France from 1350 to 1791 and then from 1824 to 1830.
* [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1661–1711)|Louis de France]] (1661–1711), the only surviving legitimately born son of [[Louis XIV]] (1638–1715), was usually not addressed by this style as he was usually referred to at court as either ''Monseigneur'' (see more below) or, informally, as ''le Grand Dauphin''.&lt;ref name = velde1/&gt;
* [[Louis of France, Duke of Burgundy|Louis de France]], (1682–1712), son of the preceding, who became the dauphin in 1711, was informally known as ''le Petit Dauphin''.&lt;ref name = velde1/&gt;

File:Portrait dauphin louis france hi.jpg|[[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729–1765)|Louis of France]] - Dauphin of Louis XV
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Monseigneur===
This was another way of addressing ''[[Louis, Dauphin of France (1661-1711)|Le Grand Dauphin]]'', the only legitimate son of Louis XIV. After the death of ''le Grand Dauphin'', the heir apparent to the throne of France for half a century, the style of ''Monseigneur'' was not used again to describe the dauphin himself. Rather, it became the style used by his sons as prefix to their peerages. During the lifetime of the ''Grand Dauphin'', his three sons were addressed as:

* ''[[Louis of France, Duke of Burgundy|Monseigneur le Duc de Bourgogne]]''
* ''[[Philip V of Spain|Monseigneur le Duc d'Anjou]]''
* ''[[Charles, Duke of Berry (1686–1714)|Monseigneur le Duc de Berry]]''

==Madame la Dauphine==
This was the style of the dynastic wife of the ''dauphin''. Some holders of the [[honorific]] were:

*[[Duchess Maria Anna of Bavaria|Duchess Maria Anna Christine Victoria of Bavaria]] (1660–1690), also called ''Dauphine Victoire'', first wife of ''[[Louis, Dauphin of France (1661-1711)|le Grand Dauphin]]'', and the grandmother of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] (1710–1774)
*[[Princess Marie-Adélaïde of Savoy|Princess Maria Adelaide of Savoy]] (1685–1712), wife of the [[Louis of France, Duke of Burgundy|Dauphin Louis]] (1682–1712) and mother of Louis XV.
*[[Infanta Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain]] (1726–1746), first wife of [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729-1765)|Louis]] (1729–1765), the only son of Louis XV, and held the style till her death at age twenty-one.
*[[Maria Josepha of Saxony (1731-1767)|Duchess Maria Josefa of Saxony]] (1731–1767), second wife of the Dauphin Louis, and mother of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] (1754–1793), [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] (1755–1824) and [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] (1757–1836).
*[[Marie Antoinette|Archduchess Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna of Austria]], ''Marie Antoinette'' was the dauphine until her husband succeeded to the throne in 1774 as Louis XVI.
*[[Marie-Thérèse Charlotte de France|Princess Marie-Thérèse Charlotte of France]] (1778–1851); daughter of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, known as ''[[Madame Royale]]'', she became the last Dauphine of France when her father-in-law, Charles X, succeeded to the throne in 1824.

File:Marie Antoinette Adult4.jpg|[[Marie Antoinette]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Madame Royale==
This was the style of the eldest surviving daughter of the king. Those who held this honorific were:
*[[Elisabeth of France (1602–1644)|Princess Élisabeth of France]], eldest daughter of King [[Henry IV of France]] (1553–1610) and his second wife, Queen [[Marie de' Medici]] (1575–1642). In 1615, Élisabeth was married to the future king, [[Philip IV of Spain]] (1605–1665). On her death in 1644, the style reverted to her younger sister, Christine Marie.
*[[Christine Marie of France|Princess Christine Marie of France]] (1606–1663), the second daughter of Henry IV and Marie de' Medici. In 1619, Christine was married to [[Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy]] (1587–1637). She assumed the style of ''Madame Royale'' upon the death of her older sister, the Queen of Spain.
*[[Princess Marie-Thérèse of France (1667–1672)|Princess Marie-Thérèse of France]] (1667–1672), the only daughter of Louis XIV and his queen to live beyond infancy.
*[[Louise Élisabeth de France|Princess Marie Louise Élisabeth of France]] (1727–1759), eldest daughter of Louis XV and his queen, [[Maria Leszczyńska]] (1703–1768). As a twin, Louise-Élisabeth rarely if ever used this title. She preferred being called ''Madame Première'', to distinguish herself from her younger twin, [[Henriette-Anne of France]] (1727–1752), who was referred to as ''Madame Seconde''. See more on this below.
*[[Princess Marie-Thérèse of France (1746–1748)|Princess Marie-Thérèse of France]] (1746–1748) eldest daughter of [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729–1765)|Louis, Dauphin of France]] (1729–1765) and his first wife [[Infanta Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain]] (1726–1746). Her mother died three days after her birth.
*[[Marie-Thérèse Charlotte de France|Princess Marie-Thérèse Charlotte of France]], eldest daughter of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. Marie-Thérèse was the sole member of her immediate family to survive the [[French Revolution]]. She also exerted a great deal of political influence during the [[Bourbon Restoration]] (1815–1830).&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, Susan, ''Marie-Thérèse, Child of Terror'', Bloomsbury USA, 2008, p.277, {{ISBN|978-1-59691-057-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the death, in 1672, of Marie-Thérèse of France, the longest living daughter of Louis XIV and his Queen, and the birth, in 1727, of Louise Élisabeth of France, the eldest daughter of Louis XV, there were no legitimate daughters of a French king. Because of this, the style was occasionally used by the most senior unmarried princess at the French Court during that period. It was briefly used by the eldest niece of Louis XIV, [[Marie Louise d'Orléans (1662–1689)|Marie Louise d'Orléans]] (1662–1689), later known as just ''Mademoiselle''. After her marriage to King [[Charles II of Spain]] (1661–1700), in 1679, the style was assumed briefly by her younger sister, [[Anne Marie d'Orléans]] (1669–1728), before she married [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia]] (1666–1732).

This honorific belonged to the oldest living brother of the King. Among those who held this style were:
*[[Charles IX of France|Charles de Valois, ''Duke of Orléans'']] (1550–1574), younger brother of [[Francis II of France|Francis II]] (1544–1560), was known as ''Monsieur'' at the beginning of the reign of Francis II. He was [[King of France]] as Charles IX from 1560 to 1574;
*[[Henry III of France|Henri de Valois, ''Duke of Anjou'']] (1551–1589), younger brother of Francis II and Charles IX, was known as ''Monsieur'' during the reign of Charles IX. He became King of France as Henry III from 1574–1589;

*[[Louis XVIII of France|Louis Stanislas Xavier of France, Count of Provence]] (1755–1824), younger brother of Louis XVI, known as ''Monsieur'' during the reign of Louis XVI, and was later King of France as Louis XVIII from 1814 to 1824;
*[[Charles X of France|Charles Philippe of France, Count of Artois]] (1757–1836) was the youngest brother of Louis XVI and Louis XVIII, and known as ''Monsieur'' at the beginning of the reign of Louis XVIII, later King of France as Charles X from 1824 to 1830.

==Madame==
This was the style of the wife of ''Monsieur''. Examples of this were:
*[[Marie de Bourbon, Duchess of Montpensier]] (1605–1627), first wife of Gaston d'Orléans (''Monsieur'') and mother of ''[[la Grande Mademoiselle]]'' (1627–1693).
*[[Marguerite of Lorraine]] (1615–1672), second wife of Gaston.
*[[Henrietta of England]] (1644–1670), the first wife of King Louis XIV's younger brother, Philippe, Duke of Orléans, (''Monsieur'').
*[[Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate|Elisabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine]] (1652–1722), the second wife of Philippe I, duc d'Orléans (''Monsieur'').
*[[Princess Marie Joséphine of Savoy|Marie Joséphine of Savoy]] (1753–1810), wife of the Count of Provence, the future Louis XVIII.

==Madame Première==
King Louis XV and his wife, Marie Leszczyńska, had ten children, eight of whom were girls. To distinguish between these eight princesses, the daughters were known in birth order as ''Madame 'number''', such as ''Madame Première'', ''Madame Seconde'', etc. This style was not a traditional right and was merely a way the court used to distinguish between the many daughters of Louis XV.

*[[Princess Louise Élisabeth of France|Princess Marie ''Louise Élisabeth'']] (1727–1759), twin with her younger sister, Henriette; married [[Philip, Duke of Parma]] (1720–1765), who was also an ''[[infante]]'' of Spain. Before her marriage, she was known as ''Madame Première''. After her marriage she was the [[Duke of Parma|Duchess of Parma]], and as such was known as ''Madame Infante, duchesse de Parme''.
*[[Princess Henriette of France|Princess Henriette Anne]] (1727–1752), twin with her older sister, Louise-Élisabeth, known as ''Madame Seconde''.
*[[Princess Louise of France|Princess Marie Louise]] (1728–1733), known as ''Madame Troisième''.
*[[Princess Marie Adélaïde of France|Princess Marie ''Adélaïde'']] (1732–1800), originally known as ''Madame Quatrième''; after her elder sister died in 1733, she was known as ''Madame Troisième''. Later, she was known as ''Madame Adélaïde''.
*[[Princess Victoire of France|Princess Louise Marie Thérèse ''Victoire'']] (1733–1799), originally known as ''Madame Quatrième'', and later as ''Madame Victoire''.
*[[Princess Sophie-Philippine of France|Princess ''Sophie'' Philippine Élisabeth Justine]] (1734–1782), ''Madame Cinquième'', known later as ''Madame Sophie''.
*[[Princess Thérèse of France|Princess Marie Thérèse Félicité]] (1736–1744), known as ''Madame Sixième''.
*[[Princess Louise of France (1737–1787)|Princess Louise]] (1737–1787), originally, known as ''Madame Septième'' or ''Madame Dernière''; known later as ''Madame Louise''.

==Petit-fils de France==&lt;!-- "Petit-fils de France" redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Charles of France, Duke of Berry wearing the sash of the order of the Holy Spirit (18th century, Nicolas de Largillière) .jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Charles, Duke of Berry (1686–1714)|Monseigneur le Duc de Berry]].]]

'''Petit-fils de France''' ("Grandson of France"). This was the style and rank accorded to the sons of the ''fils de France'', who were themselves the sons of the kings and dauphins of France. However, as surnames, they used the paternal main peerage title. Females had the style '''petite-fille de France''' ("Granddaughter of France").

The ''petits-enfants de France'', like the ''enfants de France'', were entitled to be addressed as ''son altesse royale'' ("His/Her Royal Highness"). Additionally, they traveled and lodged wherever the king did, could dine with him, and were entitled to an armchair in his presence.

Yet as hosts, they only offered armchairs to foreign monarchs—whom they addressed as ''[[Monseigneur]]'' rather than "Sire". Nor did they pay visits to foreign ambassadors, nor extend to them a hand in greeting. They only wore full [[mourning#State and official mourning|mourning]] for deceased members of the royal family.

When entering a town, they were greeted with a [[salute#Military salutes|presentation of arms]] by the royal [[garrison]], by the firing of [[cannon]], and by a delegation of local officials. However, only the sons and daughters of France were entitled to dine ''au grand couvert'', that is, alone on a canopied [[dais]] amidst non-royal onlookers.&lt;ref&gt;ib. Spanheim, Ézéchiel, pp. 87, 313-314.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mademoiselle==
This style was usually held by the eldest daughter of ''Monsieur'' and his wife, ''Madame''.&lt;ref&gt;ib. Spanheim, Ézéchiel, pp.76, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who held this style were:

*[[Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans, Duchess of Montpensier|Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans]] (1627–1693), the eldest daughter of Gaston de France.
*[[Marie Louise d'Orléans (1662–1689)|Marie Louise d'Orléans]] (1662–1689), the eldest daughter of King Louis XIV's younger brother, Philippe I, duc d'Orléans; later the wife of King Charles II of Spain.
*[[Anne Marie d'Orléans]] (1669–1728) held the style (along with ''Madame Royale'') after the marriage of her sister Marie Louise. She was the mother of [[Princess Marie-Adélaïde of Savoy|Princess Maria Adelaide of Savoy]] - later the Dauphine of France.
*[[Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans]] (1674–1744), youngest child of Philippe I, duc d'Orléans and his second wife. Married to the Duke of Lorraine, she was the paternal grandmother of Queen Marie Antoinette.
*[[Louise Anne de Bourbon]] (1695–1758), fourth child of [[Louis III, Prince of Condé]], was given the style of ''Mademoiselle'' as her cousin [[Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans|Louis d'Orléans]] had no daughter. When Louis's daughter Louise Marie was born in 1726, the title went to her. Louise Marie died in 1728 and the style reverted to Louise-Anne.
*[[Louise Marie d'Orléans]] (1726–1728), only daughter of [[Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans|Louis d'Orléans]] and his wife [[Margravine Auguste Marie Johanna of Baden-Baden]]; died in childhood.
*[[Bathilde d'Orléans|Louise Marie Thérèse ''Bathilde'' d'Orléans]] (1750–1822), daughter of the [[Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orléans|Duke of Orléans]], was known as Mademoiselle from her birth. She was the sister of [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe Égalité]].
*Sophie d'Artois (1776–1783) was the first daughter of [[Princess Maria Theresa of Savoy]] (1756–1805) and her husband, born [[Charles X of France|Charles Philippe of France]] (1757–1836).

Younger daughters of ''Monsieur'' were named after one of his [[appanage]]s, e.g.  [[Élisabeth Charlotte of Orléans|''Mademoiselle de Chartres'']] (1676–1744), the third surviving daughter of Philippe I, duc d'Orléans.

This custom was not confined to the royal family. Even untitled noble families followed the same habit.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===La Grande Mademoiselle===
After 1662, [[Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans, Duchess of Montpensier]], who was originally called ''Mademoiselle'' as the eldest daughter of Gaston duc d'Orléans, became known as ''la Grande Mademoiselle'' at court, in order to distinguish her from her younger cousin, [[Marie Louise d'Orléans (1662–1689)|Marie Louise d'Orléans]], now also called ''Mademoiselle'', as the daughter of Anne's first cousin, the new ''[[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans|Monsieur]]''. After her death in 1693, the style of ''Grande Mademoiselle'' was not used again. Thus, this was not an official style but simply a means the court used to distinguish between the two princesses who held the style of ''Mademoiselle'' at the same time.

'''Folsom Europe''' is an annual [[BDSM]] and [[leather subculture]] street fair held in September in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. Folsom Europe was established in 2003 in order to bring the non-profit leather festival concept pioneered by the [[Folsom Street Fair]] in San Francisco to Europe. Today this is the biggest gay fetish event in Europe together with [[Easter in Berlin|BLF]]'s "Easter in Berlin" which is held every Easter in [[Berlin]]. BLF is the gay leather organisation in Berlin. BLF stands for Berlin Leder und Fetisch e.V. The main area for the two fetish festivals is in [[Schöneberg]]. The Folsom Europe street festival is at Fuggerstrasse and Welserstrasse, close to [[Wittenbergplatz]]. Each year Folsom Europe is getting bigger and 2013, 10 years from the start, it was bigger than ever. Most of the visitors are gay, but all sexualities are welcome. There are also some fetish weekends in Berlin other times of the year. Some of the big parties under the festival are ''Perverts'', ''Pig'' and ''Sneakfreaxx''.

Folsom Europe is also the backdrop for the annual [[Tyrone Rontganger|German Titleholders' Conference]], an event which brings together fetish titleholders from all over the world to meet and collect money for charitable organisations in Berlin. Fundraising is an important part of this fetish street party, as it is the only event in Europe where the nuns from the Order of the [[Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence]] stand at the gates to collect funds from visitors.

In [[culture of ancient Rome|ancient Roman culture]], '''''infamia''''' (''in-'', "not," and ''fama'', "reputation") was a loss of legal or [[Social class in ancient Rome|social standing]]. As a technical term of [[Roman law]], ''infamia'' was an official exclusion from the legal protections enjoyed by a [[Roman citizen]], as imposed by a [[Roman censor|censor]] or [[praetor]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 65ff.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, especially during the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] and [[Principate]], ''infamia'' was informal damage to one's esteem or reputation. A person who suffered ''infamia'' was an '''''infamis''''' (plural '''''infames''''').

''Infamia'' was an "inescapable consequence" for certain professionals, including [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitutes and pimps]], entertainers such as [[Theatre of ancient Rome|actors]] and dancers, and [[gladiator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Catharine Edwards| title=Unspeakable Professions Public Performance and Prostitution in Ancient Rome | publisher = Princeton University Press, 1997 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZPC3TqBZEQC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | ISBN= 9780691011783|page= 67}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Infames'' could not, for instance, provide testimony in a court of law. They were liable to corporal punishment, which was usually reserved for slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, "Unspeakable Professions," p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''infamia'' of entertainers did not exclude them from socializing among the Roman elite, and entertainers who were "stars", both men and women, sometimes became the lovers of such high-profile figures as the ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'' [[Sulla]] and [[Mark Antony]].

A [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|passive homosexual]] who was "outed" might also be subject to social ''infamia'', though if he was a citizen he might retain his legal standing.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the ''cinaedus'' and the Roman Law against Love between Men," ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' 3.4 (1993), pp. 550–551, 555ff.; Edwards, "Unspeakable Professions," p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern [[Roman Catholic Church]] has a similar concept of [[infamy]].

'''Laotians in France''' consist of people of [[Lao people|Lao]] ancestry who were born in or immigrated to [[France]]. The population as of 2013 is estimated to be 90,000.&lt;ref name="Présentation du Laos"/&gt;

The Laotian community in France forms the most established [[Laotian diaspora|overseas Laotian]] population, with a presence in the country dating to before the end of the [[Laotian Civil War]] and mass refugee migration that resulted from it.&lt;ref&gt;Carine Hahn, ''Le Laos'', Karthala, 1999, page 77&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The presence of Laotian people in France began during the early 20th century, when Laos was a [[French Laos|protectorate of France]]. With the steady introduction of the French education system by the colonists, a number of Laotian students were able to study in France, including members of the [[Lao Royal Family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hahn|1999|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller number of Laotian workers also settled in France during this period. However, the largest influx of Laotians immigrated to France following the [[Vietnam War]] and communist takeover of their homeland.

France was an ideal destination for Laotian refugees who were educated or formed part of the elite and middle class in the home nation, while poorer refugees tended to emigrate to North America and Australia through the assistance of the American, Canadian and Australian governments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.immigrantinfo.org/kin/laos.htm Knowledge of Immigrant Nationalities of Santa Clara County (KIN) - Laos&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209045428/http://www.immigrantinfo.org/kin/laos.htm |date=2013-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture and demographics==
Unlike their counterpart communities in the [[Laotian American|United States]], [[Canadians of Laotian descent|Canada]] and [[Laotian Australian|Australia]], Laotians in France are more successful and better integrated into the host country due to stronger knowledge of the nation's social aspects, such as culture, language and history.&lt;ref name="Lao Voices"&gt;{{citation|url=http://laovoices.com/life-in-a-foreign-city-can-be-difficult-but-lao-culture-still-prevails/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315050941/http://laovoices.com/life-in-a-foreign-city-can-be-difficult-but-lao-culture-still-prevails/|title=Life in a foreign city can be difficult but Lao culture still prevails|work=Lao Voices|date=7 January 2012|accessdate=2013-06-22|archivedate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the issue of immigrant groups and their level of assimilation has been an important issue in French politics, the Laotian community is highly integrated into French society, with high average rates of educational and economic achievement, especially among the generations of French-born Lao.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sayasackp.free.fr/connaitrejeunesse.htm La jeunesse lao de France, quelle identité?] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

Laotian Buddhist temples serve as community and cultural centers for the Laotian population in France, and important traditional holidays such as [[Lao New Year]] and the [[Pha That Luang Festival]] are observed in addition to French holidays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lindependant.fr/2012/04/10/nouvel-an-lao-bonne-annee-2555,130094.php Nouvel an Lao] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Laotians in France live in [[Paris]] and the surrounding [[Île-de-France]] region, with smaller communities in [[Marseille]], [[Lille]] and [[Strasbourg]]. While the generation of immigrants to France tries to preserve Laotian culture and uses the Lao language among the community, the first and second generations born in France are increasingly influenced by French culture, with many members of the generations being unable to understand or speak Lao.&lt;ref name="Lao Voices" /&gt;

[[File:120508-N-IL267-091 (7166541704).jpg|thumb|A [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] personnel during a drill.]]
{{main|Law enforcement in Canada}}
In Canada, all criminal law (including the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]) falls under federal jurisdiction, but policing is a provincial responsibility. However, there is a national police force known by either its official English name '''''[[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]|RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police)''''' or its equally official French name '''''GRC (Gendarmerie Royale du Canada)'''''. The RCMP/GRC is tasked with enforcing certain federal laws throughout the country, as well as anti-terrorism duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/terr/index-eng.htm|title=Strategic Priority: National Security|first=Government of Canada, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Criminal Intelligence|last=Directorate|website=www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also perform domestic counter-espionage with the assistance of CSIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/prrts/index-eng.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121229074654/http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/prrts/index-eng.asp |archivedate=29 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, eight of the ten provinces choose to employ the RCMP/GRC under contract as their provincial police force rather than establishing their own police services; the exceptions are [[Ontario Provincial Police|Ontario]] (Ontario Provincial Police) and [[Sûreté du Québec|Québec]] (Sûreté du Québec).  Newfoundland has retained the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary for limited use, but still uses the RCMP/GRC for the majority of its provincial policing. In most provinces individual towns and cities are allowed, or required, by law to set up their own local police forces to provide policing inside their communities. Those municipalities (approx. 300 in total) which do not have their own police forces will contract instead either the RCMP/GRC (with the federal government absorbing some of the cost) or their provincial force to police the community.

=== Mainland China (People's Republic of China) ===

=== Germany ===
{{main|Law enforcement in Germany}}
Germany is a [[federal republic]] of sixteen [[States of Germany|States]] ''(Land)''. Each one of those States has its own police force called '''''[[Landespolizei]]''''' ''(State Police)'', that is providing the basic law enforcement and crime fighting. Each ''Landespolizei'' is supervised by the respective State Minister (or, in the City States of  [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Berlin]], the Senator) of Internal Affairs.

The Federal authorities have law enforcement agencies as well:
* the '''''[[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Bundeskriminalamt]]''''' (''BKA'', "Federal Crime (or Criminology) Office") which is only responsible for cases which are exceeding the borders of a single State, or for cases of international dimension.
* the uniformed '''''[[Federal Police (Germany)|Bundespolizei]]''''' (''BPOL'', in casual language also ''BuPo''; "Federal Police"). Until 2005, the BPOL was called ''Bundesgrenzschutz'' ("Federal Border Protection"), but after expanded competences (e.g. for the railways) in the 1990s and the abolition of border controls in the European Union, its name was changed to emphasize the law enforcement (=police) nature of the corps in an international context.

Depending on the state´s laws, the German cities also provide policing agencies like '''''[[Municipal police (Germany)|Stadtpolizei]]''''' ''(Municipal Police)'' or '''''[[Bylaw enforcement officer|Ordnungsamt]]''''' (local bylaw agency).

=== Luxembourg ===
The [[Grand Ducal Police]] (French: ''Police Grand-Ducale''; Luxembourgish: ''Groussherzoglech Police'' or simply ''d'Police'') is since 1 January 2000 the sole law enforcement agency in the [[Luxembourg|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]].  The Police is under the authority of the Luxem-bourgish Minister for Public Security, although it operates in the name, and under the ultimate (ceremonial) control of the head of state, HRH the [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke]] of Luxembourg.

Previously, the Luxembourgish law enforcement agencies (as well as the Army) were under the command of the Minister of Public Force, a cabinet post which no longer exists.

The Grand Ducal Police was created in its current form on 1 January 2000, when the [[Grand Ducal Gendarmerie]] merged with the State-controlled local police forces.

The Grand Ducal Police is responsible for ensuring Luxembourg's internal security, fighting crime and corruption, maintaining law and order and enforcing all laws and [[Grand Ducal decree]]s.  It is also responsible for assisting the Luxembourgish Army in its internal (war-time) operations, in accordance with the respective legislation and under the authority of the national Commander-in-Chief, HRH the Grand Duke.

Municipal regulations are enforced by "Municipal agents" (French: ''Agents municipaux''; Luxembourgish: ''Gemengenagenten''), who are partly uniformed but always unarmed municipal employees (no police officers) with strictly limited enforcement powers.

This differs from the situation in many countries including France, where policing is split between the [[Police Nationale|National Police]] and ''[[French Gendarmerie|Gendarmerie]]'', and between countries such as the United States which have a layered system of National, State/Regional and/or local Law Enforcement organizations.

The NPA is headquartered in [[Seoul]] and is divided into 14 local police agencies, including the [[Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency]]. Local police agencies are not independent of the national police. There were 96,000 police officers {{As of|2004|lc=on}}.

=== Mexico ===
{{main|Law enforcement in Mexico}}
Most police forces in Mexico can be classified into two general types based on their primary function.  They tend to operate as ''policia judicial'' (judicial police) or ''policia preventiva'' (preventive police).  The basic difference being that the ''policia judicial'' are usually under the administration of the judicial branch of government (i.e., judges, attorneys general, etc.), whereas the ''policia preventiva'' tend to be administered by legislative or executive branches of government (i.e., mayors, or city councils). Historically, the judicial police would investigate crimes that have already occurred, and preventive police would focus their efforts on preventing crimes (by active presence on the streets and random patrols).  In recent decades these differences have been blurred considerably.

Mexican law enforcement agencies, vary from state to state but usually have the hierarchy mentioned below:

*''Agencia Federal de Investigación'' ([[Federal Investigations Agency]]) – Mexican [[FBI]]
*''Policía Federal Preventiva'' ([[Federal Preventive Police]])
*''Agencia Estatal de Investigación'' ([[States of Mexico|State]] Investigations Agency)
*''Policía Estatal Preventiva'' ([[States of Mexico|State]] Preventive Police)
*''Policía Municipal Preventiva'' ([[Municipalities of Mexico|Municipal]] Preventive Police)

Widely regarded as the home of the first modern police force, law enforcement in the United Kingdom is based on the long-standing philosophy of [[policing by consent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Terrill|first1=Richard J.|title=World Criminal Justice Systems: A Comparative Survey|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317228820|page=32|edition=revised|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xZ3hCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;pg=PA32#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dempsey|first1=John S.|last2=Forst|first2=Linda S.|title=An Introduction to Policing|date=2015|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1305544684|pages=6–8|edition=8|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W4TCBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UKP&gt;{{cite web|title=Policing by consent|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/policing-by-consent|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=29 December 2013|date=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policing and law enforcement are organised separately in each of the legal systems of the United Kingdom as a result of devolution of powers to [[History of Scottish devolution|Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland Assembly (1982)|Northern Ireland]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Mayor of London|London]].

[[England and Wales]] have 43 [[territorial police forces|local police forces]] (formerly known as constabularies), each of which covers a 'police area' (a particular [[Counties of the United Kingdom|county]], grouping of counties or metropolitan area). Since 2012, 41 of these forces have their own directly elected [[Police and Crime Commissioner]], under the [[Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011]]. The two exceptions are in London, where the [[Metropolitan Police]] is accountable to the directly elected Mayor via the [[Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime|Office for Policing and Crime]], and the much smaller [[City of London Police]] that retains the Common Council of the [[City of London Corporation|City]] as its police authority.

[[Scotland]] now has a single national force – the Police Service of Scotland (Scottish Gaelic: Seirbheis Phoilis na h-Alba), commonly known as [[Police Scotland]]. It replaced eight former territorial police forces and the [[Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency]] in April 2013 and is overseen by the [[Scottish Police Authority]], under the terms of the [[Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012]].

The [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (Irish: Seirbhís Póilíneachta Thuaisceart Éireann, Ulster Scots: Polis Servis o Norlin Airlan) serves Northern Ireland, succeeding the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) in 2001. Following the [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000]], the PSNI is supervised by the [[Northern Ireland Policing Board]] (Irish: Bord Póilíneachta Thuaisceart Éireann, Ulster-Scots: Norlin Airlan Polisin Boord), who are themselves appointed since 2007 by the [[Minister of Justice (Northern Ireland)]] using the [[Nolan principles]] for public appointments.

From October 2013 the [[National Crime Agency]] (NCA) operates as the United Kingdom's first national law enforcement agency. Replacing the existing [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]] and [[Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre]], as well as assuming some of the responsibilities of the [[UK Border Agency]], but not counter-terrorism, for the first time it will have authority for "tasking and coordination" investigative work to local forces under the [[Crime and Courts Act 2013]].&lt;ref name="BBC8June"&gt;{{cite news |title=National Crime Agency details outlined by Theresa May |newspaper=BBC News Online |date=8 June 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13678653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also three [[special police forces]] that have a specific, non-regional jurisdiction – the [[British Transport Police]], [[Civil Nuclear Constabulary]], [[Ministry of Defence Police]]. Over the centuries there has been a wide variation in the number of police forces operating within the UK, most of which now no longer exist, see [[list of former police forces in the United Kingdom]]. A few [[List of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom#Miscellaneous police forces|miscellaneous constabularies]] with responsibility mostly founded on old legislation to police specific local areas, such as ports and parks, have escaped police reform. Lastly, a number of government bodies that are not police forces have detective powers and enforce laws, such as the [[Marine and Fisheries Agency]] and [[UK Border Agency]], who employ officers with limited powers of detention and search but generally cannot make full arrests.

The majority of British police are never routinely armed, relying on an extendable [[Baton (law enforcement)|baton]] and in some cases [[Taser]]s, with specialist armed units always on patrol and called in only when necessary. The exceptions are the [[Ministry of Defence Police]], the [[Civil Nuclear Constabulary]] and the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] which are routinely armed.

Uniquely in Britain, there are police forces of [[Crown Dependencies]] such as the [[Isle of Man]] and States of [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]], who have police forces that share resources with the UK police, whilst having a separate administration within their own governments. The [[British Overseas Territories]], have their own police forces which are generally based on the British model of policing.

In the United States, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation)]] and other federal agencies such as the [[United States Secret Service]], [[United States Marshals Service|US Marshals]], [[United States Park Police]], [[United States Capitol Police]], and the [[United States Pentagon Police]]  are limited to the enforcement of federal laws and usually specialize in certain crimes or duties, but do enforce some state laws. Most crimes constitutionally fall under the jurisdiction of [[state police (United States)|state police]] or the thousands of local police forces. These include [[county police]] or [[sheriff]]'s departments as well as municipal or city police forces. Many areas also have [[special police|special]] agencies such as [[University police|campus police]], [[Railroad police (U.S.)|railroad police]], housing police, or a district or precinct constable.

== International Police ==
The [[International Police]] is a functional organization made up of police officers from all over the world, serving mostly under the direction of the United Nations, to help train, recruit, and field police forces in war torn countries.  The force is usually deployed into a war torn country initially acting as the police, and bringing order. In the process, they recruit and train a local police force, which eventually takes on the responsibilities of enforcing the law and maintaining order, whereas the International Police then take on a supporting role.  To date, International Police forces have been deployed to [[East Timor]], Haiti, [[Kosovo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], Iraq, [[Afghanistan]], Sudan, [[Liberia]], Croatia, and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], among others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="52393">This is a selected list of ''[[gairaigo]]'', [[Japanese language|Japanese]] words originating or based on [[foreign language]] (generally Western) terms, including ''[[wasei-eigo]]'' (Japanese [[pseudo-Anglicism]]s).

Many of these words derive from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], due to [[Portugal]]'s early role in Japanese-Western interaction; [[Dutch language|Dutch]], due to the [[Netherlands]]' relationship with [[Japan]] amidst the policy of ''[[sakoku]]'' during the [[Edo period]]; and from French and German, due to [[France]] and [[Germany]]'s cultural and scientific prominence during Japan's modernization in the [[Meiji period]].

However, most come from [[English language|English]], the dominant world language today. Due to the large number of western concepts imported into Japanese culture during modern times, there are thousands of these English borrowings.  These English words are informally referred to as having been "Nipponized". 

Japanese vocabulary also includes large numbers of words from [[Chinese language|Chinese]], borrowed at various points throughout history.  However, since the Japanese language has such strong historical ties to the Chinese language, these loans are not generally considered ''gairaigo''. 
Many loan words are in fact ''pseudo-borrowings'': despite their links to foreign language words, the word forms as used in modern Japanese are not used in the same way in their languages of origin. In fact, many such terms, despite their similarity to the original foreign words, are not easily understood by speakers of those languages (e.g. ''left over'' as a baseball term for a hit that goes over the left-fielder's head, rather than uneaten food saved for a later meal as in English—or ''famikon'' ファミコン from "Family computer", which actually refers to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]).

See the [[list of Japanese terms mistaken for gairaigo]] for details of words or terms mistaken for foreign loan words and [[false cognates]].

:''Note:''
:'''US''' = [[American English]]
:'''UK''' = [[British English]]

==Examples==
Due to the extent of Japanese borrowings, particularly from English, this list focuses mainly on pseudo-borrowings and commonly used loan words from languages other than English (which are often mistaken for English words in Japan). Most loan words (and all modern loans) are transcribed in [[Katakana]], a kana (Japanese syllabary) whose usage approximates English italics. Older loans may be written using [[Ateji]], with Kanji used to represent their phonetic readings without necessarily inheriting their meaning. In words composed of both a loan and native Japanese, the Japanese can function as a morpheme within a compound (and would generally be written in Kanji if possible), or can be attached to the foreign word to inflect or otherwise modify it, as if it were [[okurigana]] (which is written in Hiragana).

'''Lonnie Athens''' was senior research [[criminologist]] at [[Georgetown University Law Center]] and now teaches in the criminology department at [[Seton Hall University]].&lt;ref&gt;Book catalog, [http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/45hfk5xs9780252062629.html The Creation of Dangerous Violent Criminals by Lonnie Athens], University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt; Athens developed a theory called ''The Process of Violentization''.

==Life==
===Early life===
Born in [[Richmond, Virginia]], Athens lived with his parents, Irene and Pete Athens. He was educated at [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute]], where he started majoring in [[political science]] but later changed his major to [[Sociology]] and [[Criminology]]. After graduating from Virginia Tech, Athens continued his criminology studies at the [[University of Wisconsin]].

==Career==
After college Athens continued to interview inmates about their criminal lives and social experiences. He based his study on [[George Herbert Mead]], a philosopher who tried understanding how organisms acquire different traits. Athens focused on the areas of [[Iowa]] and [[California]] for his interviews. He also worked as a probation and parole officer in northern [[Virginia]] in 1986. He took all of his findings and his studies and put them together in the book, ''The Creation of Dangerous Violent Criminals'', in which he discusses his theory and the cases he had to look at along the way. Athens now teaches criminology at [[Seton Hall University]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Richard, ''Why They Kill; The Discoveries of a Maverick Criminologist'', Vintage, 2000, {{ISBN|0-375-70248-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Process of Violentization==
Athens developed a theory known as "The Process of Violentization" which describes four stages in the development of violent actors.

'''Stage 1 Brutalization''': Within this stage, the individual engages in violent demeanor through observation and demonstration. This stage is divided into three types of experiences: 1) violent subjugation-personally assaulted or threatened 2) personal horrification-witness others assaulted or threatened  3) violent coaching-taught how to execute violent behavior.

'''Stage 2 Belligerency''': In this stage, the subject reinforces his warlike attitude to the situation by a method of different steps. With this repeating behavior they get emotionally attached to what they are doing. Because of this emotional attachment, the individual resorts to violence as a means to control and dominate others any time they are provoked. 

'''Stage 3 Violent Performances''': After surpassing the previous two stages, the individual executes violent behavior towards subordinates. In this stage, they begin to feel most comfortable with what they are doing because they start to gain respect, celebrity status, and fear from others.
'''

'''Stage 4 Virulency'''''': ''This stage defines the individual as violent and dangerous in which they use violence to gain control of others, earn respect, instill fear, and make others feel powerless, shamed, and humiliated; feelings that they avoid and no longer feel in themselves. The individual has created a violent self-image for himself/herself.[3]

&lt;ref&gt; Mark A. Winton. 2011. “Violentization Theory and Genocide.” Homicide Studies 15 (4) 363-381.&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Types of Interpretations''' 
Athens explained the four types of interpretations and linked primary emotions related to violence.          
1) Physical defensive: Fear based and focus on how a physical attack is or will be made

2) Frustrative: Anger based by which they individual notices resistance and action he/she does not want to execute.

3) Malefic: hate based in which the individual views the negative character of others and utilizes violence as his/her response.

4) Frustrative-Malefic: Hatred and anger based.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9235">The '''mācēhualtin''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA-nah|maːseːˈwaltin|}}, singular ''mācēhualli'' {{IPA-nah|maːseːˈwalli|}}) were the [[commoner]] [[social class]] in the [[Mexica Empire]], commonly referred to as the [[Aztec]] Empire.

The [[Class in Aztec society|Aztec social class]] of the ''mācēhualtin'' were rural farmers, forming the majority of the commoners in the Mexica Empire. The ''mācēhualtin'' worked lands that belonged to the social unit of the [[calpolli]] called [[chinampa]]s, with each family maintaining rights to the land so long as it did not lie fallow for more than two years.  Within these lands, the rural ''mācēhualtin'' constructed small dams and terraces to increase their agricultural yield. Crops common to [[Agriculture in Mesoamerica|Mexican agriculture]] were grown on these plots, including [[maize]], beans and squash. These projects were probably organized by the local communities and were not state led.  From their produce and productivity, the ''mācēhualtin'' were required to pay tribute to the Aztec nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coe|first1=Michael D.|last2=Koontz|first2=Rex|title=Mexico: From the Olmecs to the Aztecs|date=2013|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-500-29076-7|pages=203–204, 206|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of [[Moctezuma II]] (1502–1520), they were banned from serving in the royal palaces, as this monarch widened the divide between ''[[pipiltin]]'' ([[nobles]]) and ''macehualtin''. However, before his reign it was noted that there was some mobility, though uncommon, within the social classes. Those who moved up and became ''pipiltin'' were called ''yaotequihua''. Those who were brought down ranks in spite of birth status as ''pipiltin'' were called ''pillaquistiltin. Macehualtin'' could also become or sell their children into [[Aztec slavery|slavery]].

This possibility for [[social mobility]] was relatively uncommon due to the locative view of the world held by the Aztecs.  This point of view emphasized the idea that everyone and everything had a correct place in the world.  It was almost a moral imperative to find one's place and conform to its requirements.  This logic extended to social class, with the ''pipiltin'' being viewed as having trained to rule the rest of society, specifically made by the [[Aztec mythology|Aztec gods]] for this purpose, and the ''macehualtin'' being viewed as having been made to work for the benefit of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrasco|first1=David|last2=Sessions|first2=Scott|title=Daily life of the Aztecs|date=2011|publisher=Greenwood|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=978-0-313-37744-0|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rituals, teachings, and many other aspects of Aztec society helped to reinforce this worldview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrasco|first1=David|last2=Sessions|first2=Scott|title=Daily life of the Aztecs|date=2011|publisher=Greenwood|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=978-0-313-37744-0|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inequality among the social classes was further reinforced by societal institutions such as a differential set of laws for the commoners and those of the upper class.  This differential set of laws was harsher towards the nobility than towards the commoners for a comparable offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clendinnen|first1=Inga|title=Aztecs : an interpretation|date=1992|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Pr.|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=0-521-40093-7|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Aztec society]] was in part centered on warfare, every Aztec male received some sort of basic military training from an early age.  Typically by the time the child reached three years of age, the boy would begin to take simple instruction at the hands of his father on the tasks expected of men, no matter what social class they fell into.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clendinnen|first1=Inga|title=Aztecs : an interpretation|date=1992|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Pr.|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=0-521-40093-7|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The only extremely slim possibility of possible upwards social mobility for ''mācēhualtin'' was through military achievement. The taking of captives (''māltin'' {{IPA|[ˈmaːltin]}}, singular ''mālli'') marked an important transition into status as a full warrior, was the way for soldiers to move up the social ladder, and it continued to be a source of honor throughout a man's tenure as a warrior. Failure to take captives or perform well in battle later in life would be a source of dishonor for the warriors. While this would negatively impact warriors who were ''mācēhualtin'', it would be a worse social blow for members of the nobility, although not as materially damaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clendinnen|first1=Inga|title=Aztecs : an interpretation|date=1992|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Pr.|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=0-521-40093-7|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''mācēhualtin'' children attended the ''[[Tēlpochcalli|telpochcalli]]'' or "House of Youths" beginning at fifteen years of age. This was a school for both boys and girls, but the girls and boys learned separately.

Here they learned ritual arts like dance and song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coe|first1=Michael D.|last2=Koontz|first2=Rex|title=Mexico: From the Olmecs to the Aztecs|date=2013|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-500-29076-7|pages=203–204, 206|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divisions based on gender prominently affected children among the ''mācēhualtin.''  An emphasis on gender divisions began at birth, not just with schooling.  Some early rituals differed between newborn boys and newborn girls.  For the male children, symbolic actions like giving the umbilical cord to warriors to bury in fields where battles might take place emphasized their role as future warriors.  For the female children, symbolic actions like burying the umbilical cord near the hearth emphasized the female role in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrasco|first1=David|last2=Sessions|first2=Scott|title=Daily life of the Aztecs|date=2011|publisher=Greenwood|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=978-0-313-37744-0|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Spanish Conquest of Mexico|Spanish conquest]], the [[Nahuatl]] word ''mācēhualli'' was adopted in colonial Spanish as ''macehual'', and was used all over [[New Spain]] as a synonym for "commoner," "subject," and "native."

'''''Madame Royale''''' ({{IPA-fr|madam ʁwajal}}, ''Royal Lady'') was a [[Style - Manner of Address|style]] customarily used for the eldest living unmarried daughter of a reigning [[France|French]] [[monarch]]. 

It was similar to the style ''[[Monsieur (style)|Monsieur]]'', which was typically used by the King's second son. Just as [[Gaston, duc d'Orléans]] (1608–1660), the second son of King [[Henry IV of France]] (1553–1610), was known as '' Monsieur'', [[Elisabeth of Bourbon]] (1602–1644), the eldest daughter of Henry, was known before her marriage to King [[Philip IV of Spain]] (1605–1665) as ''Madame Royale''. After her death, the title was borne by her younger sister, [[Christine Marie of France]] (1606–1663), until her marriage to [[Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy]] (1587–1637).
 
The most famous holder of this [[honorific]] was King [[Louis XVI of France]]'s eldest daughter, [[Marie-Thérèse-Charlotte of France|Marie-Thérèse-Charlotte]] (1778–1851), the only one of his immediate family to survive the [[French Revolution]]. She later married her cousin, [[Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angouleme|Louis-Antoine, duc d'Angoulême]] (1775–1844), and played a prominent role during the [[Bourbon Restoration]].

The style ''Madame Royale'' was not regulated by any other code than that of [[etiquette]]. Its very simplicity, however, was considered more desirable than being known more formally as ''Son Altesse Royale'' ([[Royal Highness|"Your Royal Highness"]]) in conversation.

The style was customarily held until the death of the royal parent or until the princess married. 

The equivalent style in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|Great Britain]] is ''[[Princess Royal]]''. This title came into existence when Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]] (1609–1669), another daughter of King [[Henry IV of France]], and the wife of King [[Charles I of England]] (1600–1649), wanted to imitate in the [[Kingdom of England]] the way in which the eldest daughter of the sovereign in [[France]] was styled ''Madame Royale.''

In [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]], Henrietta Maria's older sister, [[Christine Marie of France]], became known as '''Madama Reale''' in reference to her French manner of address. Her daughter-in-law, [[Marie Jeanne of Savoy]], when she became regent of Savoy after the early death of her husband, called herself '''Madama Reale''', after her mother-in-law, who had also been a regent of Savoy. This was despite the fact that Marie Jeanne's father was not a king.

The '''Malayo-Polynesian languages''' are a subgroup of the [[Austronesian languages]], with approximately 385.5 million speakers. The Malayo-Polynesian languages are spoken by the [[Austronesian people]] of the island nations of [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]], with a smaller number in continental [[Asia]], going well into the Malay peninsula. Cambodia and Vietnam serve as the northwest geographic outlier. On the northernmost geographical outlier does not pass beyond the north of Pattani, which is located in southern Thailand. [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] is spoken in the island of [[Madagascar]] located off the eastern coast of Africa in the [[Indian Ocean]]. Part of the language family shows a strong influence of [[Sanskrit]] and particularly [[Arabic]] as the Western part of the region has been a stronghold of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and, since the 10th century, [[Islam]].

Two morphological characteristics of the Malayo-Polynesian languages are a system of [[affix]]ation and the [[reduplication]] (repetition of all or part of a word, such as ''[[wiki-wiki]])'' to form new words. Like other Austronesian languages they have small phonemic inventories; thus a text has few but frequent sounds. The majority also lack consonant clusters (e.g., [str] in English). Most also have only a small set of vowels, five being a common number.

==Languages==
The Nuclear Malayo-Polynesian languages are spoken by about 230 million people and include [[Malay language|Malay]] ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]]), [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Buginese language|Buginese]], [[Balinese language|Balinese]], [[Acehnese language|Acehnese]]; and also the [[Oceanic languages]], including [[Tolai language|Tolai]], [[Gilbertese language|Gilbertese]], [[Fijian language|Fijian]], and [[Polynesian languages]] such as [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[Māori language|Māori]], [[Samoan language|Samoan]], [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]], and [[Tongan language|Tongan]]. Malay is also the native language in Singapore and Brunei.

The [[Philippine languages]] are the most linguistically archaic branch of the Malayo-Polynesian language family, and are spoken by around 100 million people between [[Orchid Island]] [[Taiwan]], the entire [[Philippine archipelago]], and [[Sulawesi]] [[Indonesia]]. Philippine languages include [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]), [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Ilokano language|Ilokano]], [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], [[Central Bikol language|Central Bikol]], [[Waray language|Waray]], and [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]], each with at least three million speakers.

In Northern Borneo, the most widely spoken language is [[Kadazan-Dusun language|Kadazan-Dusun]], with over 200,000+ speakers and [[Lun Bawang language|Lundayeh Language]] is the one of the minority language in south-western [[Sabah]] and in northern [[Sarawak]].

==Classification==
===Relation to Austronesian languages on Taiwan===
The Malayo-Polynesian languages share several phonological and lexical innovations with the eastern [[Formosan languages]], including the leveling of [[Proto-Austronesian language|proto-Austronesian]] *t, *C to /t/ and *n, *N to /n/, a shift of *S to /h/, and vocabulary such as *lima "five" which are not attested in other Formosan languages. However, it does not align with any one branch.

===Internal classification===

Malayo-Polynesian consists of a large number of small local language clusters, with the one exception being [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]], the only large group which is universally accepted; its parent language [[Proto-Oceanic language|Proto-Oceanic]] has been reconstructed in all aspects of its structure (phonology, lexicon, morphology and syntax). All other large groups within Malayo-Polynesian are controversial.

====Blust (1993)====
The most influential proposal for the internal subgrouping of the Malayo-Polynesian languages was made [[Robert Blust]] who presented several papers advocating a division into two major branches, viz. '''Western Malayo-Polynesian''' and '''Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian'''.&lt;ref&gt;Blust, R. (1993).
[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3623195 Central and Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian.] ''Oceanic Linguistics, 32''(2), 241–293.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian languages|Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian]] is widely accepted as a subgroup, although some objections have been raised against its validity as a genetic subgroup.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Ross, Malcolm]] (2005), "Some current issues in Austronesian linguistics", in D.T. Tryon, ed., ''Comparative Austronesian Dictionary'', 1, 45–120. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donohue, M., &amp; Grimes, C. (2008). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20172341 Yet More on the Position of the Languages of Eastern Indonesia and East Timor.] ''Oceanic Linguistics, 47''(1), 114–158.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Western Malayo-Polynesian languages|Western Malayo-Polynesian]] is now generally held (including by Blust himself) to be an umbrella term without genetic relevance. Taking into account the [[Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian languages|Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian]] hypothesis, the Malayo-Polynesian languages can be divided into the following subgroups (proposals for larger subgroups are given below):&lt;ref&gt;Adelaar, K. Alexander, and Himmelmann, Nikolaus. 2005. ''The Austronesian languages of Asia and Madagascar.'' London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

***[[Kowiai language]]
***[[Teor-Kur language]]
**Eastern Malayo-Polynesian languages
***[[South Halmahera–West New Guinea languages]]
***[[Oceanic languages]] (approximately 450 languages)

The position of the recently "rediscovered" [[Nasal language]] (spoken on [[Sumatra]]) is still unclear, but it shares most features of its lexicon and phonological history with either [[Lampung languages|Lampung]] or [[Rejangese language|Rejang]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderbeck, Karl; Aprilani, Herdian (2013). ''[http://www.sil.org/resources/publications/entry/54043 The Improbable Language: Survey Report on the Nasal Language of Bengkulu, Sumatra]''. SIL Electronic Survey Report. SIL International.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Malayo-Sumbawan====
The [[Malayo-Sumbawan languages]] are a proposal by Adelaar (2005) which unites the [[Malayo-Sumbawan languages|Malayo-Chamic languages]], the [[Bali-Sasak-Sumbawa languages]], [[Madurese language|Madurese]] and [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] into a single subgroup based on phonological and lexical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Adelaar, A. (2005). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3623345 Malayo-Sumbawan.] ''Oceanic Linguistics, 44''(2), 357–388.&lt;/ref&gt;

***[[Chamic languages]]
***[[Bali-Sasak-Sumbawa languages]]
**[[Sundanese language|Sundanese]]

====Greater North Borneo====
The Greater North Borneo hypothesis, which unites all languages spoken on Borneo except for the [[Barito languages]] together with the [[Malayo-Sumbawan languages|Malayo-Chamic languages]], [[Rejangese language|Rejang]] and [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] into a single subgroup, was first proposed by Blust (2010) and further elaborated by Smith (2017, 2017a).&lt;ref name=Blust2010&gt;{{cite journal| last=Blust |first=Robert |title=The Greater North Borneo Hypothesis |year=2010 |journal=Oceanic Linguistics |volume=49 |issue=1 |page=44–118 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40783586}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SmithWMP&gt;{{cite journal| last=Smith |first=Alexander D. |title=The Western Malayo-Polynesian Problem |year=2017 |journal=Oceanic Linguistics |volume=56 |issue=2 |page=435–490}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Alexander (2017a). ''The Languages of Borneo: A Comprehensive Classification''. PhD Dissertation: University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Greater North Borneo
**[[Bornean languages|North Bornean languages]]
***[[Sabahan languages|Northeast Sabahan languages]]
***[[Sabahan languages|Southwest Sabahan languages]]
***[[North Sarawak languages]]
**[[Kayan–Murik languages]]
**[[Land Dayak languages]]
**[[Malayo-Sumbawan languages|Malayo-Chamic languages]]
**[[Rejangese language|Rejang language]]
**[[Sundanese language]]

Because of the inclusion of Malayo-Chamic and Sundanese, the Greater North Borneo hypothesis is incompatible with Adelaar's Malayo-Sumbawan proposal. Consequently, Blust explicitly rejects Malayo-Sumbawan as a subgroup. The Greater North Borneo subgroup is based solely on lexical evidence.

====Smith (2017)====
Based on a proposal initially brought forward by Blust (2010) as an extension of the Greater North Borneo hypothesis,&lt;ref name=Blust2010/&gt; Smith (2017) unites several Malayo-Polynesian subgroups in a "Western Indonesian" group, thus greatly reducing the number of primary branches of Malayo-Polynesian:&lt;ref name=SmithWMP/&gt;

*Western Indonesian
**Greater North Borneo
**Greater Barito
***[[Sama–Bajaw languages]]
***[[Barito languages]]
**[[Rejangese language|Rejang language]]
**[[Lampung language]]
**[[Sundanese language]]
**[[Javanese language]]
**[[Madurese language]]
**[[Bali-Sasak-Sumbawa languages]]
*Sumatran
**[[Northwest Sumatran languages]]
**[[Nasal language]]
*[[Celebic languages]]
*[[South Sulawesi languages]]
*[[Central–Eastern Malayo-Polynesian languages]]
*[[Palauan language]]
*[[Chamorro language]]
*[[Moken language]]
*[[Philippine languages]]
**(according to Smith, "not a subgroup as much as a loosely related group of languages that may contain multiple primary branches")

====Nuclear Malayo-Polynesian====
Zobel (2002) proposes a [[Nuclear Malayo-Polynesian languages|Nuclear Malayo-Polynesian]] subgroup, based on putative shared innovations in the [[Austronesian alignment]] and [[syntax]] found throughout Indonesia apart from much of Borneo and the north of Sulawesi. This subgroup comprises the languages of the [[Greater Sunda Islands]] ([[Malayo-Sumbawan languages|Malayo-Chamic]], [[Northwest Sumatran languages|Northwest Sumatran]], [[Lampung language|Lampung]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Madurese language|Madurese]], [[Bali-Sasak-Sumbawa languages|Bali-Sasak-Sumbawa]]) and most of Sulawesi ([[Celebic languages|Celebic]], [[South Sulawesi languages|South Sulawesi]]), [[Palauan language|Palauan]], [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]] and the [[Central–Eastern Malayo-Polynesian languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Fay Wouk and Malcolm Ross (ed.), 2002. ''The history and typology of western Austronesian voice systems.'' Australian National University.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is one of the few attempts to link certain [[Western Malayo-Polynesian languages]] with the [[Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian languages]] in a higher intermediate node, but has received little further scholarly attention.

'''Maltese Sign Language''' ({{lang-mt|Lingwa tas-Sinjali Maltija}}, '''LSM''') is a young [[sign language]] of [[Malta]]. It developed into its modern form c. 1980 with the establishment of the first deaf club in Malta and subsequently with its use in education for the deaf. LSM's prior history is unrecorded, though there are some signs which indicate contact with [[British Sign Language]] (Malta was [[Crown Colony of Malta|a British colony]] until 1964). These signs are relatively few, however, and LSM is not part of the [[BANZSL|BSL family]] (Brentari 2010).

Maria Galea has described the use of [[SignWriting]] when used to write Maltese Sign Language.&lt;ref name="GaleaLinguistic"&gt;{{cite book

A '''nippy''' was a  waitress who worked in the [[J. Lyons and Co.|J. Lyons &amp; Co]] [[tea shop]]s and cafés in [[London]].  Beginning in the late 19th century, a J. Lyons waitress was called a "Gladys".  From 1926, because the waitresses [[wiktionary:nip#Etymology_4|nipped]] (moved quickly) around the tea shops, the term "Nippy" came into use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Image and reality==

By the 1920s it was already long established in the advertising world that attractive females could sell products, and the tea business of J. Lyons &amp; Co was no exception.  Nippies appeared in all manner of advertising, on product packages, and on promotional items.  The Nippy soon became a national icon.  Unlike other endorsements of the day, which often took the form of popular celebrities or cartoon characters, a Nippy was accessible and close to home.  A Nippy was someone who could be seen and interacted with every day, and perhaps this was part of the appeal of the concept.  J. Lyons was very careful to maintain the Nippy image as wholesome and proper — strict cleanliness standards applied for Nippy uniforms, and before World War II  J. Lyons [[marriage bar|would not hire married women]] as Nippies. So popular was the image that miniature Nippy outfits were popular for children [[dressing up]] for special events such as [[fete|fetes]].

==Typical pay and conditions==
In the mid-1930s, for example in [[Brighton]], a Nippy worked 54 hours per week (11.45 a.m. to 11.45 p.m.){{Fix|text=how many days?}}, for 26 shillings per week ([[British pound sterling|£]]1.30), with 2/6d (two shillings and sixpence, £0.125) extra for working at weekends. She had to pay for the laundering of her uniform, which was made of [[bombazine]]-type material with red buttons from the neck downwards.

==In popular culture==
In an episode of the sitcom ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' entitled "The Junior", the character [[Mrs. Slocombe]] was embarrassed that she used to work as a nippy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Junior|series=[[Are You Being Served?]]|network=[[BBC]] |date=19 October 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Dorothy Sayers]]'s 1927 mystery novel ''Unnatural Death'', when a young woman's body is found the ''Daily Yell'' newspaper prints the story under the headline "'Nippy' Found Dead in [[Epping Forest]]." 

===''Nippy'', the musical===
In 1930, the nippy concept was adapted into a hit musical comedy called ''Nippy'', produced at the [[Golders Green Hippodrome]].  Popular actress [[Binnie Hale]] played the nippy in question.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photographersdirect.com/buyers/stockphoto.asp?imageid=648188 Stock photography image of Nippy, Music sheet cover]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was written by [[Arthur Wimperis]] and Austin Melford, [[Billy Mayerl]] wrote the music, and Wimperis and [[Frank Eyton]] wrote the lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.kent.ac.uk/library/special/Programmes/PRG1933.HTM ReadingProgrammes 1927-1933]&lt;/ref&gt; Several records were released with songs from the musical, such as the title song and the lively "The Toy Town Party" sung in the show by Hale. Another of Mayerl's lesser known but attractive melodies from the show was "It Must Be You".

'''Omid Tahvili''', ({{lang-fa|امید تحویلی}}) (born on 31 October 1970, in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]],&lt;ref name=FBI/&gt;) is an [[Iranian Canadian|Iranian-Canadian]] gangster who is the kingpin of an [[organized crime]] family in [[Crime in Canada|Canada]] which is connected to various international crime organizations.&lt;ref name = AMW/&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.forbes.com/business/2008/04/25/crime-binladen-guzman-biz-cz_nv_0425mostwanted.html | title = The World's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives | first = Nathan | last = Vardi | date = 2008-04-25 | publisher = Forbes.com | accessdate = 2008-04-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010132003/http://www.forbes.com/business/2008/04/25/crime-binladen-guzman-biz-cz_nv_0425mostwanted.html|archivedate=2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In April 2008, [[Forbes.com]], after consulting with law enforcement agencies around the world, listed him as one of the world's ten most wanted fugitives.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

==Criminal activities==

===Drugs===
According to the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP), Tahvili came to Canada from Iran in 1994.&lt;ref name = AMW&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.amw.com/fugitives/case.cfm?id=51057#wantedfor | title = Omid "Nino" Tahvili | first = Robert | last = Brown | accessdate = 2008-04-30  | year = 2008 | publisher = ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2000, he was arrested with his brother-in-law for possession of {{convert|3|kg}} of [[cocaine]], in a joint operation between the [[Vancouver Police]] and the RCMP. Tahvili was found not guilty. By 2003, the RCMP recognized Tahvili as heading up one of the main criminal organizations operating out of an Iranian community in Canada. At that time, dozens of Iranian expatriates were working under him.&lt;ref name = AMW/&gt;

===Fraud===
From 1999 to 2002, he ran a fraudulent [[telemarketing]] business that targeted people in the [[United States]], stealing approximately [[US$]]3 million from hundreds of victims, most of them elderly.&lt;ref name=FBI/&gt; A federal arrest warrant was issued for Tahvili on January 30, 2003 by the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, where he was charged with mail fraud, wire fraud, telemarketing fraud and [[aiding and abetting]].

Tahvili was arrested in British Columbia on an extradition warrant and Tahvili was eventually ordered extradited to the United States of America by the British Columbia Supreme Court on May 4, 2007. Tahvili had been represented by Canadian criminal and extradition lawyer Amandeep Singh, known for his representation of high profile and controversial international clientele such as billionaire banker fugitive Rakesh Saxena. Tahvili appealed his extradition order to the British Columbia Court of Appeal and was awaiting his appeal when he absconded from the pre-trial facility where he was held.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.singhthindlaw.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Omid Tahvili&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.listzblog.com/top_ten_most_wanted_world_criminals_list.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/04/25/crime-binladen-guzman-biz-cz_nv_0425mostwanted_slide_11.html?thisSpeed=30000 | work=Forbes | first=Nathan | last=Vardi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canlii.org/eliisa/highlight.do?text=tahvili&amp;language=en&amp;searchTitle=Search+all+CanLII+Databases&amp;path=/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2007/2007bcsc629/2007bcsc629.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Escape and conviction==
In 2005, Tahvili discovered that [[C$]]300,000 of his organization's drug money had gone missing, and suspected that a courier who had worked for him stole it and fled to [[Vietnam]]. Tahvili kidnapped the man's brother-in-law, [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] him, and interrogated him over several hours.&lt;ref name = AMW/&gt; The man was eventually let go and Tahvili was arrested soon after. Since July 2005, Tahvili had awaited trial in the maximum-security North Fraser Pretrial Centre in [[British Columbia]] until he escaped in November 2007 after bribing a security guard named Edwin Ticne.&lt;ref name = AMW/&gt; A [[closed circuit television]] video showed Tahvili leaving the Pretrial Centre wearing a janitor's uniform and being led through a series of locked doors by Ticne, and escaping through the front door.&lt;ref name=NP&gt;{{cite news | title = B.C. prison guard who helped gangster escape accepted $50,000 bribe | url = http://www.nationalpost.com/related/topics/story.html?id=423136 | date = 2008-04-05 | publisher = National Post | accessdate = 2008-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tahvili subsequently received an 11-year sentence [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']].&lt;ref name=NP/&gt; On August 8, 2008, Ticne was sentenced to three years and three months jail time for aiding in his escape.&lt;ref name=VP&gt;{{cite news|title=Prison guard gets 3 years for aiding escape |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/08/08/bc-prison-guard-edwin-ticne-sentenced.html |date=2008-08-08 |publisher=CBC Online |accessdate=2008-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080818205327/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/08/08/bc-prison-guard-edwin-ticne-sentenced.html |archivedate=August 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tahvili has connections throughout Canada, [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], and remains an international fugitive.&lt;ref name = AMW/&gt;

[[Anthony Charles Graves]] was convicted of the August 18, 1992 mass murder of six people in Somerville, after being implicated in the crime by Robert Carter - the father of one of the victims.  Carter was executed in May 2000 for his part in the crime - and in his final statement took sole responsibility for the crime: "To the Davis family, I am sorry for all of the pain that I caused your family. It was me and me alone. Anthony Graves had nothing to do with it. I lied on him in court. ...

[[Joe Elizondo]] was convicted in 1984, by a jury, of the 1983 aggravated sexual assault of his 10 yr-old step-son Robert Bienvenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=4018|title=Joe Elizondo - National Registry of Exonerations|publisher=umich.edu|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to life in prison and fined $10,000. In the fall of 1983, Robert and his 8 yr-old brother, Richard, told the Port Athur police, that they had been sexually abused by their mother, Mary Ann, 27, and their step-father, Joe, 49.  At the time, the boys' father, Richard Bienvenue, Sr. had legal custody and the boys spent weekends with their mother and step-father.  On September 23, 1983, the Elizondos were charged with sexually assaulting the boys.  After they were arrested, the couple's one-year-old daughter was removed from their custody and was later adopted by another family.  In August 1984, Joe Elizondo went on trial in [[Jefferson County Criminal District Court]], on a single count of assaulting Robert Bienvenue.  Robert told the jury that both he and his brother were forced to watch sexually explicit videos and to engage in oral sex with Joe, have oral contact with Mary Ann's breast and to have anal sex with both Joe and Mary. At times, Robert testified, another man and two women joined them.  The jury was also shown a sexually explicit picture of a kangaroo that Robert had drawn at school, as well as a sexually suggestive note written to him by a female classmate. Robert's teacher confiscated these items, prompting interrogation by Robert's father and the police. During that questioning Robert detailed the alleged abuse.  Robert's step-mother—the wife of Richard Bienvenue, Sr.—testified that the boys had told her of the abuse.

[[Mary Ann Elizondo]] was found guilty of sexually assaulting Robert during a separate trial from Joe's in 1984, and she was sentenced to 20 yrs in prison. She pleaded no contest to a second charge and was sentenced to 35 years in prison, to be served concurrently with the 20-year term.  After Joe and Mary Ann were convicted, Robert and Richard had no further contact with them. It wasn't until 1988, on Robert's 17th birthday, that he found a letter written by his mother, Mary Ann, and learned for the first time that Joe and Mary Ann were in prison. He then began writing to authorities, letting them know that he had lied when he accused his mother and step-father of sexual abuse.  Mary Ann was released on parole in 1991. She then divorced Elizondo, and married someone else. While on parole, she was ordered into group therapy and told she had to admit to sexually abusing her two sons. When she refused, she was jailed for 6 months, before being released again on parole. A Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus was filed, and in August 1995, a hearing was finally held, concerning the recantations of both boys.  Robert Bienvenue testified that his father threatened to spank him and his brother every day for the rest of their lives if they refused to testify against Elizondo and their mother. He said their father wanted to retaliate against his ex-wife for marrying Elizondo.  Richard Bienvenue also testified. Though he denied that their father forced them to lie, he said the abuse never occurred.

In 1995, the trial court found the recantations credible, set aside Joe Elizondo's conviction and ordered a new trial.  In December 1996, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals upheld the trial court ruling. "Robert's recantation not only voids his trial testimony which implicated (Joe Elizondo), but constitutes affirmative evidence of (Joe Elizondo's) innocence," the appeals court ruled. "We are convinced by clear and convincing evidence that no rational jury would convict him in light of the new evidence."  On June 23, 1997, Jefferson County District Attorney Paul McWilliams dismissed the charges against Joe Elizondo and he was released from prison that day.  Mary Ann then sought to vacate her conviction. In November 2005, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, following the decision made in Joe Elizondo's case, vacated her conviction and the charges were dismissed.  Sadly, Joe Elizondo, whose health was poor in prison, died in 2003.  In October 2008, Mary Ann (Barbosa), who had filed a state compensation claim, received her compensation of $370,833. It is unknown as to whether charges were ever filed against [[Richard Bienvenue, Sr.]], for causing his sons to falsely accuse sexual abuse against Joe and Mary Ann Elizondo.

[[Michael Morton (Criminal Justice)|Michael Morton]] was convicted of the 1986 murder of his wife, sentenced to life and spent 25 years in prison. Morton was exonerated in 2011 after DNA evidence proved another man had committed the murder. Also, other evidence turned up after the DNA tests showed that the prosecutor, Ken Anderson had withheld other evidence from the defense that would have excluded Morton from the crime. Morton's lawyers accused Anderson of failing to provide defense lawyers with this exculpatory evidence indicating that another man might have killed Morton's wife, including information that his 3-year-old son witnessed the murder and said his dad was not home at the time. In 2013 former prosecutor Ken Anderson who was now a judge was ordered to be arrested by a "court of inquiry" for failing to deliver all evidence to the defense attorneys as required by law. Anderson was forced to resign as judge and give up his Texas law license. On November 8, 2013, Anderson pleaded no contest to the charges as part of a plea bargain. He was sentenced to 10 days in jail.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11352">'''[[Advertorial|Paid news]]''' is a phenomenon in [[Indian media]], that refers to the systematic engagement of [[mainstream media]] outlets in publishing favorable articles in exchange for payment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?263242 "News You can Abuse"] Outlook, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/04/india-paid-news-scandal India : 'Paid news' scandal hits major newspapers] The Guardian, UK, 4 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of news is typically sponsored by politicians, businessmen, and celebrities in order to improve their public image or accomplish political goals. Often such articles are carried under the name "Special report".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Interview with Vineet Jain - Advertisements and runnign newspapers |accessdate=5 June 2018 |publisher=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2018 Cobrapost sting meeting with [[Times Group]] MD [[Vineet Jain]] and Sanjeev Shah revealed that large cash transaction running into hundreds of crores are routinely channeled through white collar [[investment companies]] (in this case [http://ml-india.com/ DSP] a Mumbai based [[investment bank]] operated by Hemendra Kothari  and [[Merrill Lynch]]) from political outfits and communal agencies to media houses who prefer to work through cheques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=India's dodgy 'paid news' phenomenon |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2011/feb/20/press-freedom-india |accessdate=5 June 2018 |publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Complete report on paid news |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/35436631/The-Buried-PCI-Report-on-Paid-News |publisher=Press Council of India |accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Sponsors of paid news==

===Politicians sponsoring paid news===
The [[Election Commission of India]] has detected hundreds of cases where politicians paid newspapers or TV channels to carry favorable reports.&lt;ref name="scmp"&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1274036/media-collusion-politicians-business-weakens-indian Media collusion with politicians, business weakens Indian democracy] South China Morning Post, 3 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Ashok Chavan]], is a former [[Chief Minister of Maharashtra]] whose use of funds for paid news was questioned by the [[Election Commission of India]] in 2010. The Commission stated that, "The complaint against Mr. Chavan was that he arranged publication of news items, masquerading as advertisements, in newspapers praising him in the 2009 State Assembly elections and he had not properly accounted for the expenses in his election expenditure accounts. But he claimed that the newspapers on their own might have published complimentary stories on him."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2010/07/21/stories/2010072162131500.htm Maharashtra CM Chavan Challenges EC on Paid News] The Hindu, 21 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Narottam Mishra]], a Cabinet Minister of [[Madhya Pradesh]], who has been accused by the [[Election Commission of India]], allegedly “failed to lodge his accounts of his election expenses in the manner prescribed by law” and was linked to 42 news items on him during the November 2008 state elections which “read more like election advertisements in favor of [him] alone rather than as news reports.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/yes-we-spent-money-on-paid-news-ads/article4354575.ece 'Yes, we spent money on paid news ads'] The Hindu, 30 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October 2011, [[Umlesh Yadav]] became the first ever sitting [[Member of Legislative Assembly]] (MLA) to be disqualified for not declaring the expenditure incurred on advertising during her election campaign. Yadav, a member of [[Rashtriya Parivartan Dal]], had been elected from [[Bisauli]], [[Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly|Uttar Pradesh]], in 2007. She was banned from contesting election for a period of three years by the [[Election Commission of India]].&lt;ref name="Why paid news is a threat to Indian democracy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why paid news is a threat to Indian democracy|url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/why-paid-news-is-a-threat-to-indian-democracy-1268751.html|accessdate=14 December 2013|date=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Election Commission of India|Election Commission]] is reported to have identified more than 1,400 cases of paid news between 2009 and 2013, during which elections were held in 17 states of India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lensonnews.com/lensonnews/1/59/48201/1/ec-detected-over-1400-paid-news-cases-during-assembly-polls.html "EC detected over 1,400 paid news cases during Assembly polls", Lens On News, September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Congress goes buying reporters in Chhattisgarh, offers ours Rs 25,000"&gt;{{cite news|title=Congress goes buying reporters in Chhattisgarh, offers ours Rs 25,000|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/congress-goes-buying-reporters-in-chhattisgarh-offers-ours-rs-25000/1207579/0|accessdate=14 December 2013|newspaper=Indian Express|date=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One person involved, [[Deepak Chaurasia]], host of India News, is accused of being a promoter of paid news in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/defending-kejriwal-aap-claims-3-news-channels-are-paid-media-1434437.html | title=Defending Kejriwal, AAP claims 3 news channels are 'paid media'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a video [[Aam Aadmi Party]] leader [[Arvind Kejriwal]] was seen as playing the role of a part-time editor and advising the journalist on which part of the interview should be played up more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/standpoint-on-arvind-kejriwal-s-revolutionary-media-fixing-video-1969044 | title=On Arvind Kejriwal's 'revolutionary' media fixing video| date=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Businesses and celebrities sponsoring paid news and 'private treaties'===
[[The Times Group|Bennett, Coleman and Co. Ltd]], which owns the [[Times of India]], is reported to have asked celebrities and the wealthy to pay for favorable coverage. They have offered a "private treaty" agreement, which accepts an equity stake in a company in return for favorable coverage.&lt;ref name="scmp" /&gt;  The New York Times described "private treaties" as an example of the commodification of business news.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/08/world/asia/08iht-letter.html?_r=0 "In India, Sometimes News Is Just a Product Placement"], Akash Kapur, 7 May 2010, The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; A ''New Yorker'' article says that the ''Times of India''  "have been dismantling the wall between the newsroom and the sales department" with Times MediaNet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/10/08/121008fa_fact_auletta "Citizens Jain: Why India’s newspaper industry is thriving"], Ken Auletta October 8, 2012, The New Yorker&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar practices by other media companies came to light as [[Jindal Steel]] filed litigation media company [[Zee News]] for allegedly demanding advertisements so as not to telecast shows in relation to the [[Indian coal allocation scam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livemint.com/Politics/3ELPLCt9OgGceFmZSejplJ/Jindal-distributed-CDs-of-the-sting-operation.html Steel company says it is suing the Subhash Chandra-owned network for Rs 200 crore], LiveMint.com&lt;/ref&gt;

An older report by media critic ''The Hoot'' identified how "private treaties" influence reporting.&lt;ref name="the hoot"&gt;[http://www.thehoot.org/web/home/story.php?storyid=3174&amp;sectionId=4 "How private treaties influence reporting"] Clifton D'Rozario, The Hoot, 17 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, the CEO designate of Times private treaties, in an interview with [[MediaNama]], justified the practices as "there are two currencies for advertising – cash and treaties".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medianama.com/2008/06/223-there-are-two-currencies-for-advertising-cash-and-treaties-were-not-buying-to-sell-s-sivakumar-ceo-designate-times-private-treaties/ “There Are Two Currencies For Advertising – Cash And Treaties; We’re Not Buying To Sell”] Sivakumar, CEO Designate of Times Private Treaties, in an interview with MediaNama. June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hoot's report named several companies besides Sobha Developers and [[Pyramid Saimira]] (now defunct) that participated in ''Times private treaties'': Birla Power Solutions Ltd, Deccan Aviation, Pantaloon, Provogue, Spice Mobiles Limited, Videocon Industries Ltd, Deccan Aviation, India Infoline, The Home Store, Amity Education, Paramount Airways, Future Group, Sahara One, Precept Pictures etc.&lt;ref name="the hoot"/&gt;

==Criticism of paid news==
Some groups have criticized paid news including Bloomberg, who claimed that "''paid news'' was rotting India's democracy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-25/-paid-news-is-rotting-India-s-democracy-choudhury.html 'Paid News' Is Rotting India's Democracy] Bloomberg, 25 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Analytic Monthly Review'' has also criticized India's media problems to well known problems in the political economy after the adoption of neo-liberal policies.&lt;ref name="AMR"&gt;[http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2013/amr160813.html "The Reality of Media in India "] Analytical Monthly Review, Aug 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a two person panel of the [[Press Council of India]] investigated the phenomenon of paid news in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Report on paid news (30 July 2010) |url=http://www.presscouncil.nic.in/OldWebsite/CouncilReport.pdf |website=www.presscouncil.nic.in |publisher=Press council of India |accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a detailed 72 page report citing names and instances where information that had been paid for had been passed off as genuine news.&lt;ref name="rpt"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thakurta |first1=P.J. |last2=Sreenivas Reddy |first2=K |title='Paid News': The Buried Report |url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/paid-news-the-buried-report/266542 |accessdate=3 July 2018 |publisher=Outlook |date=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Press council rejected their findings and published a shorter watered down version of the report.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/06/18/india-media-buries-paid-news-report/ India Media Buries Paid News Report] India Real Time - WSJ, 18 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 and 2018, sting operations by [[Cobrapost]], an Indian investigative journalism news agency was publicized and its videos posted in public. The videos showed a journalist posing as an RSS person who approached popular television and news media channels to publish and telecast news that would publicize fake news, promote the [[BJP]], communal issues, [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|hindutva right wing ideology]] and vilify their political opponents. Nearly all the news channels agreed to the proposal, describing how they had themselves run campaigns to get the BJP elected.&lt;ref name="wire"&gt;{{cite news |title=Cobrapost Sting: Big Media Houses Say Yes to Hindutva, Black Money, Paid News |url=https://www.thewire.in/media/cobrapost-sting-big-media-houses-say-yes-to-hindutva-black-money-paid-news |accessdate=5 June 2018 |publisher=The Wire |date=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Prevention of Crime Act 1959''' ({{lang-ms|Akta Pencegahan Jenayah 1959}}) is a [[Malaysia]]n law which enacted to deal with [[crime prevention]] and for the control of [[criminal]]s, members of [[secret societies]], [[terrorist]]s and other undesirable persons. Persons detained under the Act were not precluded from making a claim '[[Habeas corpus|Habeas Corpus]]' (a court order to release the person detained is not in accordance with legal procedures that should be). Originally, POCA only came into force in peninsular Malaysia.

The act is necessary to stop action by a substantial body of persons both inside and outside Malaysia to cause, or to cause a substantial number of citizens to fear, organized violence against persons or property.

==Structure==
The Prevention of Crime Act 1959, in its current form (1 December 2015), consists of 5 Parts containing 23 sections and 3 schedules (including 12 amendments).
* Part I: Powers of Arrest and Remand
* Part II: Inquiries
* Part III: Registration
* Part IV: Consequences of Registration
* Part IVA: Detention Orders
* Part V: General
* Schedules

The term '''private-collective model of innovation''' was coined by [[Eric von Hippel]] and [[Georg von Krogh]] in their 2003 publication in ''[[Organization Science: A Journal of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences|Organization Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Eric von Hippel and Georg von Krogh (2003) "Open Source Software and the 'Private-Collective' Innovation Model: Issues for Organization Science" Organization Science 14, 209-223.&lt;/ref&gt; This innovation model represents a combination of the private investment model and the collective-action innovation model.

In the '''private investment model''' innovators appropriate financial returns from innovations through [[intellectual property rights]] such as patents, copyright, licenses, or trade secrets. Any [[knowledge spillover]] reduces the innovator's benefits, thus freely revealed knowledge is not in the interest of the innovator.

The '''[[Collective action|collective-action innovation model]]''' explains the creation of [[public goods]] which are defined by the non-rivalry of benefits and non-excludable access to the good. In this case the innovators do not benefit more than any one else not investing into the public good, thus [[Free rider problem|free-riding]] occurs. In response to this problem, the cost of innovation has to be distributed, therefore governments typically invest into public goods through public funding.

As combination of these two models, the private-collective model of innovation explains the creation of public goods through private funding. The model is based on the assumption that the innovators privately creating the public goods benefit more than the free-riders only consuming the public good. While the result of the investment is equally available to all, the innovators benefit through the ''process'' of creating the public good. Therefore, private-collective innovation occurs when the process-related rewards exceed the process-related costs.&lt;ref&gt;Democratizing innovation (2005) Eric von Hippel, MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg von Krogh (2008) "Researching the Private-Collective Innovation Model" The SAGE Handbook of New Approaches in Management and Organization, Daved Barry and Hans Hansen (ed.) Sage, 396-397.&lt;/ref&gt;

A laboratory study&lt;ref&gt;Gächter, S., von Krogh, G., Haefliger, S. "Initiating private-collective innovation: The fragility of knowledge sharing," Research Policy, 39(7), 2010, pp. 893-906.&lt;/ref&gt; traced the initiation of private-collective innovation to the first decision to share knowledge in a two-person game with multiple equilibria. The results indicate fragility: when individuals face opportunity costs to sharing their knowledge with others they quickly turn away from the social optimum of mutual sharing. The opportunity costs of the "second player", the second person deciding whether to share, have a bigger (negative) impact on knowledge sharing than the opportunity costs of the first person to decide. Overall, the study also observed sharing behavior in situations where none was predicted.

Recent work&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Helena Garriga, Efe Aksuyek, Georg F. von Krogh, Fredrik Hacklin, What social preferences matter in private-collective innovation? Behavioral game theory in collective action, Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, Forthcoming&lt;/ref&gt; shows that a project will not "take off" unless the right incentives are in place for innovators to contribute their knowledge to open innovation from the beginning. The article&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; explores social preferences in the initiation of PCI. It conducted a simulation study that elucidates how inequality aversion, reciprocity, and fairness affect the underlying conditions that lead to the initiation of Private-collective innovation.

While firms increasingly seek to cooperate with outside individuals and organizations to tap into their ideas for new products and services, mechanisms that motivate innovators to "open up" are critical in achieving the benefits of open innovation.

The theory of private collective innovation has recently been extended by a study on the exclusion rights for technology in the competition between private-collective and other innovators.&lt;ref&gt;Alexy, O., Reitzig, M. "Private-collective innovation, competition, and firms' counterintuitive appropriation strategies", Research Policy, 42(4), 2013, pp. 895-913.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors argue that the investment in orphan exclusion rights for technology serves as a subtle coordination mechanism against alternative proprietary solutions.

Additionally, the research on private-collective innovation has been extended with theoretical explanations and empirical evidence of egoism and altruism as significant explanations for cooperation in private-collective innovation. Benbunan-Fich and Koufaris&lt;ref&gt;Benbunan-Fich, R., Koufaris, M., "Public contributions to private-collective systems: the case of social bookmarking", Internet Research, 23(2), 2013, pp. 183-203.&lt;/ref&gt; show that contributions to a social bookmarking site are a combination of intentional and unintentional contributions. The intentional public contribution of bookmarks is driven by an egoistic motivation to contribute valuable information and thus showing competence.

==Example: Development of Free and Libre Open Source Software==

The development of '''[[Open source|open source software]]''' / '''[[Free software|Free Software]]''' (consequently named Free and Libre Open Source Software – '''[[FLOSS]]''') is the most prominent example of private-collective innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Eric von Hippel and Georg von Krogh "Free revealing and the private-collective model of innovation incentives", R&amp;D Management, 36(3), 2006, pp. 295-306.&lt;/ref&gt; By definition, FLOSS represents a '''[[public good]]'''. It is [[Non-rivalrous|non-rival]] because copying and distributing software does not decrease its value. And it is [[non-excludable]] because FLOSS licenses enable everyone to use, change and redistribute the software without any restriction.

'''Páez''' (also '''Paez''', '''Paes'''; the [[Exonym and endonym|autonym]] '''Nasa Yuwe''' 'Nasa language' is becoming increasingly used) is a language of [[Colombia]], spoken by the [[Paez people|Páez people]]. Crevels (2011) estimates 60,000 speakers out of an ethnic population of 140,000.&lt;ref name=e21&gt;{{Ethnologue21|pbb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language is spoken by the second largest Colombian indigenous community, the [[Páez people|Páez]], in the north of the [[Cauca Department]], in southwestern Colombia. However, the people had to move to other departments of Colombia like [[Huila Department|Huila]], [[Tolima Department|Tolima]] and [[Valle del Cauca Department|Valle del Cauca]].

==Classification==
{{main|Paezan languages}}

Páez is generally considered to be a language isolate, or at least the only surviving member of its family (Adelaar &amp; Muysken 2004).

==History==
Although many Colombian indigenous languages have disappeared since colonial times, there are still more than 60 languages in Colombia, classified into 10 linguistic families: [[Chibchan languages|Chibcha]], [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]], [[Cariban languages|Caribe]], [[Quechuan languages|Quichua]], [[Tucanoan languages|Tukano]], [[Guajiboan languages|Guahibo]], [[Macro-Puinavean languages|Makú-Puinave]], [[Bora-Witoto languages|Witoto-Bora]], [[Piaroa-Saliban languages|Sáliba]], and [[Choco languages|Chocó]]. Currently, the Chibcha family has languages from [[Santa Marta]]: [[Arhuaco language|Arhuaco]], [[Kogi language|kogui]], [[Wiwa language|Wiwa]], [[U'wa language|Tunebo]], [[Barí language|Motilone]], [[Chimila language|Chimila]] and [[Kuna language|Cuna]], but it used to be believed that Nasa Yuwe was part of the Chibcha family.

Agriculture is the basis of the people's economy and so they have been fighting to expand their fields. With territorial expansion, they could spread out their own language. For instance, Nasa Yuwe speakers could recently develop their culture in the east and the west of their own township.

The language has been endangered for many centuries. The first threat against the language was in the 17th century, with the imposition of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for education in Colombia.

In the 20th century, people believed that Nasa Yuwe had roots from Chibcha, but the former language is now considered an isolate. Also, in the Páez townships, there are many groups of Guambianos that allow the creation of some linguistic variations and bilingualism.

In education, the Nasa Yuwe were oppressed by the dominant culture, which wanted them to become Colombian citizens. Schooling was partly to civilize the indigenous; children who spoke in their native language were punished such as by being forced to kneel on grains of corn for hours. Thus, people were forced to avoid their native language.

==Revitalization==
With the General Law of Education, ethnoeducation is the opportunity of education for ethnic groups, but education needs to be related to the culture, traditions, language, and native elements of ethnic groups. To achieve the goal to give importance to indigenous languages, it is important to ensure that future indigenous generations preserve and relearn languages that do not have social privilege in Colombian society. Thus, it was necessary to implement booklets and original content material in the different languages.

Although the government proposed the introduction of education of native languages in some communities, the preservation of languages and identities has been neglected. It is important to revitalize the language because it is part of the identity of many people who have been not considered part of Colombian society.

The first step is for the native teachers to know all the academic aspects and the sociocultural aspects of the ethnic group. The next is the creation of a campaign to promote the importance of the language in a minority community to maintain identity. The goal of the campaign is to reinforce the use of the language in the education environment and the family environment because they are children's first and most influential contacts. The last step is to promote the project to being used with other endangered languages of our country and revitalize them. Also, it is also necessary to create a conscience in the rest of the society to avoid the marginalization of the people who speak these native languages.

== Phonology ==
Paez has four vowel sounds: /a, e, a, u/. Each vowel demonstrates nasalization and vowel length, all of which are contrastive. In addition, each vowel sound can be laryngealized. Laryngealization can occur to nasalized or plain vowels, but not to lengthened vowels, while nasalization can occur to a plain or lengthened vowel. However, vowel length is not contrastive in all dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~saphon|title=SAPhon – South American Phonological Inventories|website=linguistics.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the U.S. Department of State reported 31,833 rapes in China, but no similar report by the Chinese government has been made available.&lt;ref name="marquez"&gt;{{cite news|author=Marquez, Paxcely |date=7 May 2009 |title=Rape in China |work=US-China Today |publisher=University of Southern California |accessdate=26 March 2015 |url=http://www.uschina.usc.edu/w_usci/showarticle.aspx?articleID=13037&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016100422/http://www.uschina.usc.edu/w_usci/showarticle.aspx?articleID=13037&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 |archivedate=October 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marital rape is not illegal in China.

==History==
During the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644-1912), rape was very difficult to prove. A woman who was sexually attacked had to prove that she had offered the utmost resistance and fought vigorously throughout the entire ordeal. Failure to do so would expose the woman herself to criminal prosecution for being complicit in "consensual illicit intercourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ng, V. W. | year = 1987 | title = Ideology and sexuality: rape laws in Qing China | journal = The Journal of Asian Studies | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–70 | url = http://rbedrosian.com/Sex02/Ng_1987_Qing_Rape_Laws.pdf | doi=10.2307/2056666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence, analysis and statistics==
[[File:A country comparison of rape and sexual assault rate trends, per 100000 people, 2003 - 2011, United Nations.png|thumb|340px|Annual rape and all forms of [[sexual assault]]s per 100,000 people.]]
Rape in China is not widely discussed in the media. Luo Tsun-yin, a social psychologist at Shih Hsin University in [[Taiwan]], asserts that fewer than one in 10 rape cases in China are reported.&lt;ref name="marquez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/i-was-raped-china-americans-perspective-12231018.html?cat=72 |title=I was Raped in China (An American's Perspective) |work=Yahoo Voices |date=18 July 2013 |accessdate=26 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109232053/http://voices.yahoo.com/i-was-raped-china-americans-perspective-12231018.html?cat=72 |archivedate=January 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 ''Multi-country Study on Men and Domestic Violence'' asked men in China if they had ever coerced a female partner into having sex (including [[drug facilitated sexual assault|alcohol facilitated rape]]). 22.2% said yes. 9.3% had done so in the past year. 19.4% raped their partner. 55% of the men who had raped had done so more than once and 9% had have so on four or more partners. 86% cited sexual entitlement as their motive (the highest percentage in the study) and 57% answered that they raped out of boredom. 72.4% experienced no legal consequences. 1.7% had raped another man. 25.1% who had raped reported first doing so as a teenager. 2.2% admitted to having committed gang rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Fulu, E., Warner, X., Miedema, S., Jewkes, R., Roselli, T., &amp; Lang, J. | year = 2013 | title = Why do some men use violence against women and how can we prevent it.

Freedom from violence and the law: a global perspective in light of the Chinese domestic violence law, 2015. University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Law. 2015 Nov;37(1):1-52&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous cases of sexual assault are unrecorded. The survey of previous paragraph has updated some new information, it turns out that 22.7 percent of males acknowledged that they had raped a woman before. Further, only 24.9 percent of Chinese sexual culprits were in custody while other countries surveyed had average 32.5 percent. In addition, only 15.6 percent of Chinese criminals were sent to jail while other countries had average 22.9 percent. The data shows Chinese reports for sexual assault is lower than other countries in Asia Pacific region, but in fact it is not the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2014-07/28/content_17942252.htm|title=Tough facts about rape in China[1]- Chinadaily.com.cn|last=Ligao|first=Nie|date=|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research has found that there is no existing psychometric measure assessing attitudes toward rape in China. For example, researchers found that men endorse the view that revealing clothing conveys consent for sex.&lt;ref&gt;Xue J, Fang G, Huang H, Cui N, Rhodes KV, Gelles R.

DOI: 10.1177/0886260516651315&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
The laws against rape in China have been criticized by some, including Guo Jianmei, who noted that weaknesses in the legal system make it possible for certain rapists to escape justice.&lt;ref name="lafran"&gt;{{cite news | author = LaFraniere, Sharon | date = 22 September 2011 | title = Rape Case Is a Rarity in Chinese Justice System | work = New York Times | accessdate = 26 March 2015 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/world/asia/rape-case-is-a-rarity-in-chinese-justice-system.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex rape was not illegal until 2015 in China, and legal loopholes previously allowed child rapists to escape with light sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/09/china-to-end-loophole-in-child-rape-law-experts-say/ | author = Tatlow, Didi Kirsten | title = China to End Loophole in Child Rape Law, Experts Say | work = New York Times | date = 9 December 2013 | accessdate = 7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a man who raped another man was convicted of "intentional injury" rather than rape, as non-consensual same-sex sexual conduct was not defined as a sexual offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = 5 January 2011 | title = Male rape case may be China's first | work = UPI | url = http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2011/01/05/Male-rape-case-may-be-Chinas-first/UPI-12021294258161/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = 5 January 2011 | title = Man rapes man in China; escapes conviction | work = Rediff.com News | url = http://www.rediff.com/news/report/man-rapes-man-in-china-escapes-conviction/20110105.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015 ChinaDaily reported another same-sex case which happened in Luzhou city, Sichuan province. In this case, a man robbed and raped him another man, but did not face sanction for the second crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2015-11/01/content_22339298.htm|title=Male rape now a crime after law revision  - China - Chinadaily.com.cn|last=刘小卓|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015 Xinhua reported that the criminal code was amended to include the sexual assault and rape of men, citing the above case. In addition, sex with underaged (defined as under 14 years of age) prostitutes was reclassified as rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-11/01/c_134771435.htm | author = Xinhua | title = Male rape now a crime after law revision | work = Xinhua | date = 15 November 2015 | accessdate = 15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/china-makes-male-rape-a-crime-a6718276.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years some additional legislation has been passed. The Draft Law was the first to define domestic violence in China, and its benefits include outlining how to obtain restraining orders, and providing guidelines to officials such as judges and police officers with how to handle cases of domestic violence in congruity with the law. However, there are weaknesses in this law as it only covers family members, and excludes protection for unmarried, divorced, dating, and LGBTQ partners.

There are 5,500 people of [[Russians|Russian]] origin living in [[Austria]], mostly in [[Vienna]] and [[Salzburg]].

There has been a Russian community in Vienna since the 17th century. The first Russians came in Austria for business and educational reasons. In the 1920s, the community grew after the [[Russian Civil War]]. Some more Russians came to Austria in the 1990s.

The [[Russian Embassy School in Vienna]] serves Russian families in the city.

{{American socialism |History}}

The '''Alien Registration Act''', popularly known as the '''Smith Act''', [[76th United States Congress]], 3d session, ch. 439, {{USStat|54|670}}, {{usc|18|2385}} is a [[United States federal statute]] that was enacted on June 29, 1940. It set criminal penalties for advocating the overthrow of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] by force or violence and required all non-[[US citizenship|citizen]] adult residents to register with the federal government.

Approximately 215 people were indicted under the legislation, including alleged [[communism|communists]], [[anarchism|anarchists]], and [[fascism|fascists]]. Prosecutions under the Smith Act continued until a series of [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decisions in 1957&lt;ref&gt;PatriotDEMs [http://patriotdems.wordpress.com/2009/04/19/the-red-dunhams-of-washington-state-1956/ The "Red" Dunhams of Washington State 1956]&lt;/ref&gt; reversed a number of convictions under the Act, as [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. The law has been amended several times. 

==Legislative history==
The U.S. government has attempted on several occasions to regulate speech in wartime, beginning with the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] of 1798. During and following World War I, a series of statutes addressed a complex of concerns that included enemy espionage and disruption, anti-war activism, and the radical ideologies of anarchism and [[Bolshevism]], all identified with immigrant communities. Congressional investigations of 'extremist' organizations in 1935 resulted in calls for the renewal of those statutes. The [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]] of 1938 addressed a particular concern, but not the general problem.&lt;ref&gt; Steele, Richard W.  ''Free Speech in the Good War'' (NY: St. Martin's Press, 1999), pp.39-42.&lt;/ref&gt; As U.S. involvement in the European war seemed ever more likely, the possibility of betrayal from within gained currency. The [[Spanish Civil War]] had given this possibility a name, a "[[fifth column]]", and the popular press in the U.S. blamed internal subversion (especially by Communists opposed to the war against Hitler after the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]) for the fall of France to the Nazis in just six weeks in May and June 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, ''Free Speech'', pp.74-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Patriotic organizations and the popular press raised alarms and provided examples. In July 1940, ''Time'' magazine called fifth column talk a "national phenomenon".&lt;ref&gt;Steele, ''Free Speech'', pp.75-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1930s, several legislative proposals tried to address sedition itself and the underlying concern with the presence of large numbers of non-citizens, including citizens of countries with which the U.S. might soon be at war. An omnibus bill that included several measures died in 1939, but the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] revived it in May 1940. It drew some of its language from statutes recently passed at the state level and combined anti-alien and anti-sedition sections with language crafted specifically to help the government in its attempts to deport [[Harry Bridges]]. With little debate, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] approved it by a vote of 382 to 4, with 45 not voting, on June 22, 1940, the day the French signed an [[Second Armistice at Compiègne|armistice with Germany]]. The [[United States Senate|Senate]] did not take a recorded vote.&lt;ref name="Steele, Free Speech, 81"&gt;Steele, ''Free Speech'', p.81.&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on June 28, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=15973 |title=Franklin D. Roosevelt: "Statement on Signing the Alien Registration Act.," June 29, 1940 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |publisher=University of California - Santa Barbara |work= The American Presidency Project |accessdate=September 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act is referred to by the name of its principal author, Rep. [[Howard W. Smith]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]-[[Virginia]]), a leader of the anti-labor bloc in Congress.&lt;ref name="Grantham"&gt;Grantham, Dewey. ''The South in Modern America: A Region at Odds'' (Fayetteville: University of Arkansas Press, 2001), p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few weeks later, the ''New York Times'' discussed the context in which the alien registration provisions were included and the Act passed:&lt;ref name=reg&gt;''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/08/25/96932000.pdf Delbert Clark, "Aliens to Begin Registering Tuesday," August 25, 1940], accessed June 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The Alien Registration Act was merely one of many laws hastily passed in the first spasm of fear engendered by the success of fifth columns in less fortunate countries. Suddenly the European war seemed almost at our doors, and who could tell what secret agents were already at work in America? So, partly because some such bill would be adopted anyway, and partly because the step, normally distasteful, appeared inevitable, the Administration sponsored the legislation.}}

Also in June, the President transferred the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] from the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] to the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ), demonstrating that the federal government viewed its alien population as a security concern as war grew more likely.

In mid-August, officials of the DOJ held a two-day conference with state officials they called "Law Enforcement Problems of National Defense". Attorney General [[Robert H. Jackson|Jackson]] and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Director [[J. Edgar Hoover|Hoover]] delineated the proper roles for federal and state authorities with respect to seditious activities. They successfully forestalled state regulation of aliens and found state officials receptive to their arguments that states needed to prevent vigilantism and protect aliens, while trusting federal authorities to use the Smith Act to deal with espionage and "fifth column" activities.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, ''Free Speech'', pp.80-3; ''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/08/07/112751510.pdf Frederick R. Barkley, "Crime Parley Puts Spy Issue up to FBI," August 7, 1940], accessed July 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 13, 1941, the 77th United States Congress amended the Smith Act, authorizing a [[Crime|criminal offense]] for the unlawful reproduction of [[Permanent residence (United States)|alien registration receipt cards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legisworks.org/congress/77/publaw-268.pdf |title=Alien Registration Act Amendment of 1941 ~ P.L. 77-268 |date=October 13, 1941 |series=55 Stat. 736 ~ Senate Bill 1512 |publisher= Legis★Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
'''Title I. Subversive activities.''' The Smith Act set federal criminal penalties that included fines or imprisonment for as long as twenty years and denied all employment by the federal government for five years following a conviction for anyone who:

{{quote|...with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any such government, prints, publishes, edits, issues, circulates, sells, distributes, or publicly displays any written or printed matter advocating, advising, or teaching the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or violence, or attempts to do so; or...organizes or helps or attempts to organize any society, group, or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow or destruction of any such government by force or violence; or becomes or is a member of, or affiliates with, any such society, group, or assembly of persons, knowing the purposes thereof.}}

The Smith Act's prohibition of proselytizing on behalf of revolution repeated language found in previous statutes. It went beyond earlier legislation in outlawing action to "organize any society, group, or assembly" that works toward that end and then extended that prohibition to "membership" or "affiliation"—a term it did not define—with such a group.

'''Title II. Deportation.''' Because the Supreme Court in ''Kessler v. Strecker'' (1939) held that the [[Immigration Act of 1918]] allowed the deportation of an alien only if his membership in a group advocating the violent overthrown of the government had not ceased,&lt;ref&gt;Steele, ''Free Speech'', 102-3&lt;/ref&gt; the Smith Act allowed for the deportation of any alien who "at the time of entering the United States, or ... at any time thereafter" was a member of or affiliated with such an organization.&lt;ref&gt;Section 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smith Act expanded the grounds for deporting aliens to include weapons violations and abetting illegal immigration. It added heroin to the category of drug violations.

'''Title III. Alien registration.''' The Smith Act required aliens applying for visas to register and be fingerprinted. Every other alien resident of the United States:

{{quote|who is fourteen years of age or older, ... and remains in the United States for thirty days or longer, [is] to apply for registration and to be fingerprinted before the expiration of such thirty days.}}

Registration would be under oath and include:

{{quote|(1) the date and place of entry of the alien into the United States; (2) activities in which he has been and intends to be engaged; (3) the length of time he expects to remain in the United States; (4) the criminal record, if any, of such alien; and (5) such additional matters as may be prescribed by the Commissioner [of Immigration and Naturalization], with the approval of the Attorney General.}}

Guardians had to register minors, who had to register in person and be fingerprinted within 30 days of their fourteenth birthday. Post offices were designated as the location for registering and fingerprinting. Aliens were to notify the government if their residence changed and confirm their residence every three months. Penalties included fines up to $1000 and up to six months imprisonment.

==Alien registration==
Registrations began on August 27, 1940, and the newly created Alien Registration Division of the Immigration and Naturalization Service planned to register between three and three and a half million people at 45,000 post offices by December 26, after which those not registered became subject to the Smith Act's penalties. The Division held the view that registration benefited the alien, who "is now safeguarded from bigoted persecution." The alien was to bring a completed form to a post office and be fingerprinted. Registration cards would be delivered by mail and would serve "in the nature of protection of the alien later runs afoul of the police." {sic} The details required for registration had been expanded since the passage of the Act to include race, employer's name and address, relatives in the U.S., organization memberships, application for citizenship, and military service record for the U.S. or any other country. [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] [[Francis Biddle]] had responsibility for the Division,&lt;ref name=reg /&gt; which was headed by [[Earl G. Harrison]] during its first six months.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1941/01/22/85292809.pdf "Resigns Alien Registry Post," January 22, 1941], accessed June 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In a radio address meant to reassure aliens, Biddle said: "It was not the intention of Congress to start a witch hunt or a program of persecution." Calling it a "patriotic duty", he said:&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/08/26/113102811.pdf "Alien Registration Lauded by Lehman," August 25, 1940], accessed June 27, 2012. As registration began, New York's liberal Gov. [[Herbert Lehman]] said the process was "designed to protect the loyal aliens" and urged cooperation. Others like New York Mayor [[Fiorello La Guardia]] explained that fingerprinting, though associated with criminal prosecutions, implied no "stigma". He issued a proclamation that said: "Fingerprinting is not degrading or humiliating. It is the most modern and scientific means of accurate identification." He and his staff had there fingerprints taken on the first day of registration.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1950, following an Immigration and Naturalization Service hearing, [[Claudia Jones]], a citizen of Trinidad, was ordered deported from the U.S. for violating the [[McCarran Act]] as an alien (non-U.S. citizen) who had joined the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] (CPUSA). The evidence of her party membership included information she provided when completing her Alien Registration form on December 24, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1950/12/22/82087717.pdf "Ouster Ordered of Claudia Jones," December 22, 1950], accessed June 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal proceedings==

===Harry Bridges===
The Smith Act was written so that federal authorities could deport radical labor organizer [[Harry Bridges]], an immigrant from Australia.&lt;ref name="Steele, Free Speech, 81"/&gt; Deportation hearings against Bridges in 1939 found he did not qualify for deportation because he was not ''currently''—as the {{auto link|Alien Act of 1918}} required—a member of or affiliated with an organization that advocated the overthrow of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, ''Free Speech'', 102&lt;/ref&gt; The Smith Act allowed deportation of an alien who was a member of affiliated "at any time" since arriving in the U.S. A second round of deportation hearings ended after ten weeks in June 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, "Free Speech'', 105, 107-9&lt;/ref&gt; In September, the special examiner who led the hearings recommended deportation, but the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) reversed that order after finding the government's two key witnesses unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;Steel, ''Free Speech'', 208; ''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1942/01/06/85192709.pdf Frederick R. Barkley, "Bridges is Cleared by Appeals Board," January 6, 1942], accessed June 22, 2012. The special examiner was [[Charles B. Sears]], a distinguished attorney and retired judge.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1942, though the Roosevelt administration was now putting its anti-Communist activities on hold in the interest of furthering the [[Allies of World War II|Soviet-American alliance]], Attorney General Biddle overruled the BIA and ordered Bridges deported.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, ''Free Speech'', 208-11; ''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1942/05/29/85558116.pdf Lewis Wood, "Bridges Ordered Deported at Once," May 29, 1942], accessed June 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Bridges appealed and lost in District Court&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1943/02/09/88514496.pdf Lawrence E.

===Minneapolis 1941===
[[File:Goldman-Albert-1942.jpg|thumb|right|Albert Goldman, a member of the Socialist Workers Party and defendant in the Minneapolis case, acted as chief defense counsel.]]

On June 27, 1941, as part of a campaign to end labor militancy in the defense industry, FBI agents raided the Minneapolis and St. Paul offices of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP),&lt;ref&gt;Donna T. Haverty-Stacke, "'Punishment of Mere Political Advocacy': The FBI, Teamsters Local 544, and the Origins of the 1941 Smith Act Case," ''Journal of American History,'' vol. 100, no. 1 (June 2013), pg. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; a Trotskyist splinter party that controlled Local 544 of the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters union]] though it had fewer than two thousand members in 30 U.S. cities. The union had grown steadily in the late 1930s, had organized federal relief workers and led a strike against the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA), a New Deal agency.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, ''Free Speech'', 130-2&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-July, a federal [[grand jury]] indicted 29 people, either members of the SWP or Local 544 of the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters union]], or both.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1941/07/16/99237530.pdf "29 Reds Indicted in Overthrow Plot," July 16, 1941], accessed June 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

SWP defendants included [[James P. Cannon]], [[Carl Skoglund]], [[Farrell Dobbs]], [[Grace Carlson]], [[Harry DeBoer]], {{auto link|Max Geldman}}, [[Albert Goldman (politician)|Albert Goldman]], and twelve other party leaders. Goldman acted as the defendants' lawyer during the trial. The SWP had been influential in Minneapolis since the [[Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934|Teamsters Strike of 1934]]. It advocated strikes and the continuation of labor union militancy during [[World War II]] under its [[Proletarian Military Policy]]. An SWP member edited ''the Northwest Organizer'', the weekly newspaper of the Minneapolis Teamsters, and the local remained militant even as the national union grew more conservative. The CPUSA supported the trial and conviction of Trotskyists under the Smith Act. The defendants were accused of having plotted to overthrow the U.S. government in violation of the unused [[Sedition Act (1861)|Sedition Act of 1861]] as well as the newly passed Smith Act.

When critics argued that the government should adhere to the doctrine enunciated by Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Holmes]] that free speech could only be prosecuted if it presented "a clear and present danger," Attorney General Biddle replied that Congress had considered both that standard and the international situation when writing the Smith Act's proscriptions. At trial the judge took Biddle's view and refused to instruct the jury in the "clear and present danger" standard as the defendants' attorneys requested.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, ''Free Speech'', 134ff., 138&lt;/ref&gt; The trial began in Federal District Court in Minneapolis on October 27, 1941. The prosecution presented evidence that the accused had amassed a small arsenal of pistols and rifles and conducted target practices and drills. Some had met with [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] in Mexico, and many witnesses testified to their revolutionary rhetoric.

The judge ordered that five of the defendants be acquitted on both counts for lack of evidence. After deliberating for 56 hours, the jury found the other 23 defendants (one had committed suicide during the trial) not guilty of violating the 1861 statute by conspiring to overthrow the government by force. The jury found 18 of the defendants guilty of violating the Smith Act either by distributing written material designed to cause insubordination in the armed forces or by advocating the overthrow of the government by force.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1941/12/02/105167259.pdf "18 Guilty of Plot to Disrupt Army, They and 5 Others Freed of Sedition," December 2, 1941], accessed June 20, 2012; Steele, ''Free Speech'', 138-9&lt;/ref&gt; The jury recommended leniency.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, ''Free Speech'', 138-9&lt;/ref&gt; On December 8, 1941, 12 defendants received 16-month sentences and the remaining 11 received 12-months.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1941/12/09/105169087.pdf "18 are Sentenced in Sedition Trial," December 9, 1941], accessed June 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' magazine minimized the danger from the SWP, calling it "a nestful of mice." The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and critics on the left worried that the case created a dangerous precedent.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, ''Free Speech'', 139&lt;/ref&gt;

On appeal, a unanimous three-judge panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals]] upheld the convictions of the 18. The judges found it unnecessary to consider the "clear and present danger" standard in "situations where the legislative body had outlawed certain utterances."&lt;ref&gt;Relying on ''[[Gitlow v. New York]]''. Steele, ''Free Speech'', 140&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court declined to review the case. Those convicted began to serve their sentences on December 31, 1943. The last of them were released in February 1945. Biddle, in his memoirs published in 1962, regretted having authorized the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Biddle, ''In Brief Authority'' (Doubleday, 1962), 152&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi sympathizers and racists===
Early in 1942, President Roosevelt, supported by the rest of his Cabinet, urged Attorney General Biddle to prosecute fascist sympathizers and anti-Semites.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, ''Free Speech'', 150-1, 155. Those prosecuted under the Espionage Act for encouraging insubordination in the military included Robert Noble, Ellis O. Jones, and [[William Dudley Pelley]].&lt;/ref&gt; Biddle thought the Smith Act inadequate, but Congress refused to renew the Sedition Act of 1918 as he asked.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, ''Free Speech'', 152-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, 16 members of the "[[Mankind United]]" semi-religious cult, including founder Arthur Bell, were arrested by the FBI under the act. Although 12 were found guilty, they all won on appeal and none served time.

====Crusader White Shirts====
In March 1942, the government charged {{auto link|George W. Christians}}, founder of the {{auto link|Crusader White Shirts}}, with violating the Smith Act by attempting to spread dissent in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1942/03/28/85525593.pdf Lewis Wood, "G.W. Christians Accused of Sedition After Writings to Army Camps," March 28, 1942], accessed July 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''Life'' had published a photo of Christians in 1939 under the heading "Some of the Voices of Hate".&lt;ref&gt;''Life'', March 6, 1939, 60, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lU0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp; available online], accessed July 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Christians said he promoted a "human effort monetary system"&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1942/06/03/104313543.pdf "Christians Denies 'Plot'," June 3, 1942], accessed July 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and supported "a paper and ink revolution for economic liberty". After a four-day trial, he was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison on June 8.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1942/06/09/105169983.pdf "Five-Year Sentence Given to Christians," June 9, 1942], accessed July 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

====Washington 1944====
Thirty prominent individuals were indicted in [[Washington, D.C.]], in July 1942, accused of violations of the Smith Act. After delays while the government amended the charges and struggled to construct its case, the trial, expanded to 33 defendants, began on April 17, 1944. The defendants were a heterogeneous group that held either isolationist or pro-fascist views. In the case of ''U.S. v. [[Joe McWilliams|McWilliams]]'', the prosecutor, [[O. John Rogge]], hoped to prove they were Nazi propaganda agents by demonstrating the similarity between their statements and enemy propaganda. The weakness of the government's case, combined with the trial's slow progress in the face of disruption by the defendants, led the press to lose interest.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, ''Free Speech'', 224&lt;/ref&gt; A mistrial was declared on November 29, 1944, following the death of the trial judge, [[Edward C. Eicher]].&lt;ref name="Steele, Free Speech, 227"&gt;Steele, ''Free Speech'', 227&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Among the defendants were: [[George Sylvester Viereck]], Lawrence Dennis, [[Elizabeth Dilling]], [[William Dudley Pelley]], [[Joe McWilliams]], [[Robert Edward Edmondson]], [[James True]], [[Gerald Winrod]], [[William Griffin (publisher)|William Griffin]], [[Prescott Freese Dennett]], and ''in absentia'' [[Ulrich Fleischhauer]].&lt;/ref&gt; Defendant [[Lawrence Dennis]] mocked the affair by subtitling his account of the trial ''The Great Sedition Trial of 1944''.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Dennis and Maximilian St. George, ''Trial on Trial: The Great Sedition Trial of 1944'' (National Civil Rights Committee, 1946)&lt;/ref&gt;

Only Rogge, a committed liberal, wanted to retry the case to "stop the spread of racial and religious intolerance."&lt;ref name="Steele, Free Speech, 227"/&gt; Supreme Court decisions since the 1942 indictments made convictions appear ever more unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;''Schneiderman v. United States'' (1943), ''[[Taylor v. State of Mississippi|Taylor v. Mississippi]]'' (1943), ''Bridges v. Wixon'' (1945). Steele, ''Free Speech'', 225, 228&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Nash Baldwin|Roger Baldwin]] of the ACLU campaigned against renewing the prosecutions, securing the endorsement of many of the defendants' ideological opponents, including the [[American Jewish Committee]], while  the CPUSA held out for prosecuting them all to the limit. [[Tom C. Clark|Tom Clark]], Biddle's replacement as Attorney General in the [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] administration, vacillated about the case. In October 1946, he fired Rogge in a public dispute about publicizing DOJ information about right-wing activities. With the end of World War II, attention turned from the defeated ideologies of the Axis powers to the threat of Communism, and in December 1946 the government had the charges dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, ''Free Speech'', 229-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communist Party trials===
{{main article|Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders}}
After a ten-month trial at the [[Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse|Foley Square Courthouse]] in [[Manhattan]], eleven leaders of the Communist Party were convicted under the Smith Act in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;They included [[Gil Green (politician)|Gil Green]], a long-time party leader; Eugene Dennis and [[Henry Winston]], leaders of the national organization; [[John Gates]], editor of the ''[[Daily Worker]]''; and [[Gus Hall]], leader of the party in Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt; Ten defendants received sentences of five years and $10,000 fines. An eleventh defendant, [[Robert G. Thompson]], a distinguished hero of the [[Second World War]], was sentenced to three years in consideration of his military record. The five defense attorneys were cited for [[contempt of court]] and given prison sentences. Those convicted appealed the verdicts, and the Supreme Court upheld their convictions in 1951 in ''[[Dennis v. United States]]'' in a 6-2 decision.

Following that decision, the DOJ prosecuted dozens of cases. In total, by May 1956, another 131 communists were indicted, of whom 98 were convicted, nine acquitted, while juries brought no verdict in the other cases.&lt;ref&gt;Claudius O. Johnson, "The Status of Freedom of Expression under the Smith Act," ''Western Political Quarterly'', vol. 11, no. 3 (September 1958), 469-70&lt;/ref&gt; Other party leaders indicted included [[Claudia Jones]] and [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], a founding member of the ACLU who had been expelled in 1940 for being a Communist.

Appeals from other trials reached the Supreme Court with varying results. On June 17, 1957, ''[[Yates v. United States]]'' held [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] the convictions of numerous party leaders in a ruling that distinguished between advocacy of an idea for incitement and the teaching of an idea as a concept. The same day, the Court ruled 6-1 in ''[[Watkins v. United States]]'' that defendants could use the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] as a defense against "abuses of the legislative process." On June 5, 1961, the Supreme Court [[Scales v. United States|upheld by 5-4]] the conviction of [[Junius Scales]] under the "membership clause" of the Smith Act. Scales began serving a six-year sentence on October 2, 1961. He was released after serving fifteen months when President John F. Kennedy commuted his sentence in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/07/nyregion/junius-scales-communist-sent-to-us-prison-dies-at-82.html Ari L. Goldman, "Junius Scales, Communist Sent to Prison, Dies at 82," August 7, 2002], accessed April 23, 2011; ''New York Times'': [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0C14FA3C581A7B93CAAB1789D95F468685F9&amp; "Clemency for Scales," December 28, 1962], accessed April 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

(Trials of "second string" communist leaders also occurred in the 1950s, including that of [[Maurice Braverman]].)

'''Temasek Holdings''' Private Limited (abbreviated as '''Temasek''') is a Singaporean holding company owned by the [[Government of Singapore]].

==History==

===Incorporation===

At the point of [[History of the Republic of Singapore#Independence of Singapore|Singapore's independence]] in August 1965, the [[Government of Singapore]] had ownership or joint ownership of various local companies, such as [[Malaysia-Singapore Airlines]] (later split up into [[Malaysia Airlines]] and [[Singapore Airlines]]) and the Singapore Telephone Board (which became [[Singapore Telecommunications]]). As part of its push for local and foreign private investment in sectors such as manufacturing and shipbuilding, the government's [[Economic Development Board]] (EDB) also bought minority stakes in a variety of local companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.edb.gov.sg/content/edb/en/why-singapore/about-singapore/our-history/1960s.html|title = About Singapore - Our History - The Sixties}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the first ten years after independence, the government acquired or established several companies,&lt;ref&gt;[[Government-owned corporation#Singapore]]&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Keppel Corporation]] (originally Keppel Shipyard, taken over from the [[Royal Navy]] after the British military withdrawal from Singapore), [[ST Engineering]] (originally a weapon manufacturer set up to supply the [[Singapore Armed Forces]]), and the shipping company [[Neptune Orient Lines]].

In 1974, Temasek was incorporated under the Singapore Companies Act&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3Ac3063e4b-61ed-4faf-8014-fabd5b998ed7%20%20Status%3Ainforce%20Depth%3A0;rec=0|title = Singapore Statues Online - 50 - Companies Act}}&lt;/ref&gt; to hold and manage the assets previously held directly by the Singapore government. The goal was for Temasek to own and manage these investments on a commercial basis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.temasek.com.sg/mediacentre/speeches?detailid=8600|title = Speeches by Ho Ching, Executive Director &amp; CEO, at the Institute of Policy Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the [[Ministry of Finance (Singapore)|Ministry of Finance]] and the [[Ministry of Trade and Industry (Singapore)|Ministry of Trade and Industry]] to focus on policymaking. Temasek's established mission was to contribute to Singapore's economic development, [[industrialisation]], and financial diversification by nurturing effective and commercially driven strategic investments in and around [[Singapore]].

===Status===
Temasek is a company incorporated in Singapore, and operates under the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act. It is neither a government agency nor a [[Statutory boards of the Singapore Government|statutory board]]. Like any other commercial company, Temasek pays [[tax]]es that contributes to government revenue in the countries it operates in, distributes dividends to its shareholder and has its own board of directors and a professional management team. Its sole shareholder is Singapore's Ministry of Finance.

Temasek is designated a Fifth Schedule&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.modernmeadow.com/press-release/modern-meadow-series-b-press-release/|title=Modern Meadow Closes $40M Series B Round to Commercialize Biofabricated Leather - Modern Meadow|work=Modern Meadow|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; entity under the Singapore Constitution, which imposes certain safeguards to protect the government's past reserves. For instance, the approval of the President of Singapore is required for any transaction which is likely to result in a draw-down of Temasek's cash reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-smrt-corp-m-a-temasek-holdings-idUSKCN11Z1L9|title=Shareholders approve Temasek buyout of Singapore rail operator|date=29 September 2016|work=Reuters|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president also has the right to appoint, terminate, or renew the members of Temasek's board of directors. In most other respects, however, Temasek operates as an independent commercial investment holding company.

In a 2009 speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.temasek.com.sg/mediacentre/speeches?detailid=8600|title = Speeches - Media Centre - Temasek}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ho Ching]], Temasek's Executive Director and CEO, said that the company had made an effort to instill discipline and professionalism, and to be tested and measured by providing public markers of performance.  She noted that Temasek's bonds spreads and credit ratings have been regularly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-affirms-Temaseks-Aaa-rating--PR_271122|title = Moody's affirms Temasek's Aaa rating}}&lt;/ref&gt; and independently&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = S&amp;P CONFIRMS AAA RATING AS TEMASEK UPSIZES GLOBAL NOTES TO US$15 BILLION|date = 15 July 2013|url = http://asiatoday.com.au/content/sp-confirms-aaa-rating-temasek-upsizes-global-notes-us15-billion}}&lt;/ref&gt; monitored as public markers of Temasek's financial position and credit risks. Temasek had also openly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Tougher challenges for Temasek ahead|date = 17 July 2012|url = http://www.timesbusinessdirectory.com/Singlenews.aspx?DirID=86&amp;rec_code=821045&amp;title=Tougher%20challenges%20for%20Temasek%20ahead|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131102070607/http://www.timesbusinessdirectory.com/Singlenews.aspx?DirID=86&amp;rec_code=821045&amp;title=Tougher%20challenges%20for%20Temasek%20ahead|archivedate = 2 November 2013|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accurately&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/nsp-next-president-champion-transparency-gic-temasek-173953147.html?nf=1|title=Temasek Holdings responds to NSP's claims|date=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; disclosed its financial information through its annual report (although Ho said that, as a private company, it was not legally obliged to do so).

=== Initial holdings ===
Temasek's initial portfolio of S$354 million comprised shares previously held by the Singapore Government, including a [[Jurong Bird Park|bird park]], a hotel, a shoe maker, a detergent producer, naval yards converted into a ship repair business, a start-up airline, and an iron and steel mill.

=== Stake Buy ===
In June 2018, Temasek invested S$340 million in a minority stake in UST Global, a digital technology services company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/temasek-invests-340m-in-ust-global|title=Temasek invests $340m in UST Global|last=hermes|date=2018-06-28|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the stake was not disclosed.

==Controversy==

===Shin Corp===
Temasek is fully owned by Singapore's Ministry of Finance, and these close links to the government have on several occasions caused protests in foreign countries. 
{{Main|Sale of Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings}} Temasek's 2006 acquisition of [[Shin Corporation]], owned by the family of then Thai prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], was particularly controversial, with protestors burning effigies of Lee and Ho on the streets of Bangkok.&lt;ref name="asiamedia"&gt;[http://www.international.ucla.edu/cnes/article/41204 Thailand: Protesters burn images of Lee, wife. Bangkok Post], 18 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The deal was a factor in exacerbating the [[Thailand political crisis 2005-2006|Thai political crisis]], which eventually led to the downfall of Thaksin and a review of the transaction's legality.  The [[CDRM|military junta]] that overthrew Thaksin, later tried unsuccessfully to force Temasek to divest a large part of its investment in Shin Corp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=337&amp;Itemid=32 Thailand Moves Against Foreign Firms], Asia Sentinel, 10 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, Temasek's stake in [[Intouch Holdings|Intouch Corporation]] (as Shin Corporation was renamed) had reduced to 42%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.temasekreview.com.sg/major-investments/telecommunications-media-and-technology.html#table|title=Temasek Review|date=4 July 2015|publisher=Temasek|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]] described the investment in Shin Corp as a "spectacular misjudgment"&lt;ref name="asiasentinel.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/society/singapores-lee-family-and-nepotism/|title=Singapore's Lee Family and Nepotism - Asia Sentinel|date=24 February 2012|publisher=|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Temasek sold a 21% stake in Intouch Holdings, the Thai telecoms conglomerate formerly known as Shin Corp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/temasek-sells-telco-shares-to-singtel-for-247b|title=Temasek sells telco shares to Singtel for $2.47b|last=hermes|date=2016-08-19|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nepotism===
In 2012, Singaporean blog TR Emeritus alleged that the appointment of Ho Ching, Singapore Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]]'s wife, as CEO of Temasek Holdings was a case of cronyism and nepotism, which was subsequently deleted and for which they apologised.&lt;ref name="asiasentinel.com"/&gt;

'''Keppel Corp Corruption'''

Temasek Holdings owns 20.43% of Keppel Corporation as at 15 May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.kepcorp.com/en/content.aspx?sid=68|title=Keppel Corporation - Investor FAQs|website=m.kepcorp.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was revealed and proven that key appointment holders at Keppel was involved in a corruption scandal which involved Brazil and the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/2126198/oil-bribes-politicians-what-happened-clean-singapore|title=Oil, bribes, politicians: what happened to ‘clean’ Singapore?|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2001 to 2014, Keppel O&amp;M paid US$55 million in bribes to secure contracts with Brazilian oil giant Petrobras. This corruption case shocked the nation greatly as the image of Singapore being a corruption-free nation and financial hub was jeopardised. As part of the resolution, Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine (Keppel O&amp;M) will pay fines amounting to US$422.2 million (S$570 million), to be allocated between the US, Brazil, and Singapore

Keppel Corporation's offshore and marine unit has reached a global resolution with criminal authorities in the United States, Brazil and Singapore in relation to corrupt payments made by a former agent in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Table A.86. Brazil: Payments made on the basis of area, animal numbers, receipts or income|doi = 10.1787/888933761340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tigre people''' are an ethnic group inhabiting [[Eritrea]] and [[Sudan]]. They are closely related to the [[Tigrayans]] and [[Beja people|Beja]]. The Tigre speak the [[Tigre language]], which belongs to the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family.

==History==
The Tigre are a nomadic pastoralist community living in the northern, western, and coastal lowlands of [[Eritrea]] (Gash-Barka, Anseba, Northern Red Sea regions of Eritrea and other regions too), as well as areas in eastern [[Sudan]]. 95.5% of the Tigre people adhere to [[Islam]] ([[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]), but there are a small number of [[Christianity|Christians]]
(who are very likely members of [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]]) among them as well (often referred to as the ''Mensaï'' in Eritrea).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yakan|first=Muḥammad Zuhdī|title=Almanac of African peoples &amp; nations|year=1999|publisher=Transaction|isbn=978-1-56000-433-2|pages=667|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B4VgTJaVqCwC&amp;pg=PA667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Tigre converts to Islam were those who lived on islands in the [[Red Sea]] and were converted in the seventh century. Mainland Tigre were not converted to Islam until the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="olson"/&gt;

The Tigre are closely related to the [[Tigrayans]] of Eritrea,&lt;ref name="olson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Olson|first=James Stuart|title=The peoples of Africa: an ethnohistorical dictionary|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-313-27918-8|pages=557–58|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=MdaAdBC-_S4C&amp;pg=PA557}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Beja people|Beja]] (particularly the Hadendoa).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute|publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute|page=609|url=http://www.google.com/books?id=SIRxMmigw8wC|accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a number of Eritreans of Tigre origin living in the [[Middle East]], [[North America]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]].

==Language==
The [[Tigre language]] is an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language of the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch. Like [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], it is a member of the [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopian Semitic]] group, and is similar to ancient [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=H|title=Th Encyclopedia of Britannica|date=1888|url=https://books.google.com/?id=P6EMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA655&amp;dq=tigre+ge%27ez+people#v=onepage&amp;q=tigre%20ge%27ez%20people&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no known historically written form of the language. The Eritrean government uses the [[Ge'ez script|Ge'ez writing system]] (an [[abugida]]) to publish documents in the Tigre language.

Tigre is the [[lingua franca]] of the multi-ethnic lowlands of western and northern Eritrea, including the northern coast. As such approximately 75% of the Western Lowlands Eritrean population speaks Tigre.

Since around 1889, the [[Ge'ez script]] (Ethiopic script) has been used to write the Tigre language. Tigre speakers formerly used [[Arabic]] more widely as a lingua franca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tigré|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/tig|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to most Tigre speakers being Muslim, the language is also written in the [[Arabic alphabet]].&lt;ref name=Weekes&gt;{{cite book|last=Weekes|first=Richard V.|title=Muslim peoples: a world ethnographic survey|year=1978|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0837198801|page=418|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8eNVAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tigre people, language and their area of inhabitation should not be confused with that of the [[Tigrayans]], who live in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia and speak [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], a closely related Semitic language.

'''Turks in Saudi Arabia''' ({{lang-tr|{{italics correction|Suudi Arabistan Türkleri}}}}) are either [[Turkish people]] who live in [[Saudi Arabia]] even though having been born outside [[Saudi Arabia]], or are Saudi Arabian-born, but have Turkish roots. By Turkish roots, this could mean roots linking back to [[Turkey]], the island of [[Cyprus]] or the communities of the [[Turkish diaspora]].

== History ==

Turks have had a presence in the western Arabian peninsula for hundreds of years, culminating in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the Hejaz in 1517. After the [[Great Arab Revolt]] and the decline of the [[Ottoman Empire]], a Turkish minority remained in the newly founded Saudi Kingdom.

Starting in the 1970s, economic relations between [[Turkey]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] grew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fuller|2008|loc=125}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, there was 6,500 Turks in [[Saudi Arabia]], 5,000 of which were officially reported workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hale|1981|loc=249}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sirageldin|2003|loc=236}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jung|Piccoli|2001|loc=140}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Unan|2009|loc=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business ==
There are some 2,100 [[Turkish people|Turkish]]-operated hairdresser shops, 3,200 restaurants, and 1,900 furniture stores in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ergener|2002 |loc=76}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion ==
Turkish people living in Saudi Arabia are [[Sunni]] [[Muslims]]. [[Turkish people|Turkish]] laborers returning from [[Riyadh]] seem to be less likely to espouse [[Shariah]] (Islamic law) than those living in European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Robbins.

'''Jay Vivian Chambers''' (April 1, 1901 – July 9, 1961), known as '''Whittaker Chambers''', was an American editor who denounced his Communist spying and became respected by the [[Conservatism in the United States|American Conservative movement]] during the 1950s.

After early years as a [[Workers Party of America|Communist Party]] member (1925) and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spy (1932–1938), he defected from communism ([[GRU|underground]] and open party) and worked at ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' magazine (1939–1948).  Under subpoena in 1948, he testified in what became [[Alger Hiss]]'s [[perjury]] (espionage) trials (1949–1950) and he became an outspoken [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] (all described in his 1952 memoir ''Witness'').&lt;ref name=Witness&gt;

Chambers described his childhood as troubled because of his parents' separation and their need to care for their mentally ill grandmother.  His father was a half-closeted homosexual and treated Whittaker cruelly, while his mother was neurotic.&lt;ref name="newyorker"&gt;

Chambers would cite his brother's fate as one of many reasons that he was drawn to communism at that time. As he wrote, communism "offered me what nothing else in the dying world had power to offer at the same intensity, faith and a vision, something for which to live and something for which to die."&lt;ref name=Witness /&gt;

After graduating from [[South Side High School (Rockville Centre, New York)|South Side High School]] in neighboring [[Rockville Centre, New York|Rockville Centre]] in 1919, Chambers worked itinerantly in Washington and New Orleans, briefly attended [[Williams College]], and then enrolled as a day student at [[Columbia College of Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="Witness"/&gt; At Columbia, his undergraduate peers included [[Meyer Schapiro]], [[Frank S. Hogan]], [[Herbert Solow (journalist)|Herbert Solow]], [[Louis Zukofsky]], [[Arthur F. Burns]], [[Clifton Fadiman]], [[Elliott V. Bell]], [[John Gassner]], [[Lionel Trilling]] (who later fictionalized him as a main character in his novel ''The Middle of the Journey''),&lt;ref&gt;Staff.[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917938,00.html "A Sad, Solemn Sweetness"], ''[[Time (magazine)]]'', November 17, 1975. Retrieved September 24, 2008. "Trilling's first and only novel, published in 1947, made his name known in an unexpected circle—the FBI. Titled The Middle of the Journey, the book described the intellectual torture of a Communist in the process of quitting the party. Reviews which praised its "assurance, literacy and intelligence" aroused the interest of FBI agents investigating Whittaker Chambers's allegations of spying by State Department official Alger Hiss. Indeed Trilling had shared a class with Chambers when both were Columbia students, and he frankly admitted fictionalizing Chambers's story in his novel."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guy Endore]], and [[City College of New York|City College]] student poet [[Henry Zolinsky]]. In the intellectual environment of Columbia he gained friends and respect. His professors and fellow students found him a talented writer and believed he might become a major poet or novelist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tanenhaus|1998|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communism and espionage==

In 1924, Chambers read [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s ''Soviets at Work''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/mar/soviets.htm |title=Soviets at Work |publisher=marxists.org |author=Vladimir Ilyich Lenin |access-date=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was deeply affected by it. He now saw the dysfunctional nature of his family, he would write, as "in miniature the whole crisis of the middle class"; a malaise from which Communism promised liberation. Chambers's biographer [[Sam Tanenhaus]] wrote that Lenin's authoritarianism was "precisely what attracts Chambers ... He had at last found his church"; that is, he became a [[Marxist]].  In 1925, Chambers joined the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party of the United States]] (CPUSA) (then known as the [[Workers Party of America]]). Chambers wrote and edited for Communist publications, including ''[[Daily Worker|The Daily Worker]]'' newspaper and ''[[New Masses|The New Masses]]'' magazine.

Combining his literary talents with his devotion to Communism, Chambers wrote four short stories in 1931 about [[proletarian]] hardship and revolt, including ''Can You Make Out Their Voices?'', considered by critics as one of the best pieces of fiction from the American Communist movement.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Harvnb|Tanenhaus|1998|pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Hallie Flanagan]] co-adapted and produced it as a play entitled ''[[Can You Hear Their Voices?]]'' (q.v. [[Bibliography of Whittaker Chambers]]), staged across America and in many other countries.  Chambers also worked as a translator during this period; among his works was the English version of  [[Felix Salten]]'s 1923 novel ''[[Bambi, A Life in the Woods]]''.&lt;ref name=translations&gt;

Chambers was recruited to join the "Communist underground" and began his career as a spy, working for a [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] apparatus headed by [[Alexander Ulanovsky]] (aka Ulrich). Later, his main controller in the underground was [[J. Peters|Josef Peters]] (whom CPUSA General Secretary [[Earl Browder]] later replaced with [[Rudy Baker]]). Chambers claimed Peters introduced him to [[Harold Ware]] (although he later denied he had ever been introduced to Ware), and that he was head of a Communist underground cell in Washington that reportedly included:&lt;ref&gt;

==Break with Communism==

[[File:Poyntz-Juliet-1918.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Juliet Stuart Poyntz]] (circa 1918), whose disappearance spurred Chambers to defect]]

Chambers carried on his espionage activities from 1932 until 1937 or 1938 even while his faith in Communism was waning. He became increasingly disturbed by [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]], which began in 1936. He was also fearful for his own life, having noted the murder in Switzerland of [[Ignace Reiss]], a high-ranking Soviet spy who had broken with Stalin, and the disappearance of Chambers's friend and fellow spy [[Juliet Stuart Poyntz]] in the United States. Poyntz had vanished in 1937, shortly after she had visited Moscow and returned disillusioned with the Communist cause due to the Stalinist Purges.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Harvnb|Tanenhaus|1998|pp=131–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chambers ignored several orders that he travel to Moscow, worried that he might be "purged." He also started concealing some of the documents he collected from his sources. He planned to use these, along with several rolls of microfilm photographs of documents, as a "life preserver" to prevent the Soviets from killing him and his family.&lt;ref name="Witness" /&gt;

In 1938, Chambers broke with Communism and took his family into hiding, storing the "life preserver" at the home of his nephew and his parents. Initially, he had no plans to give information on his espionage activities to the U.S. government. His espionage contacts were his friends, and he had no desire to inform on them.&lt;ref name="Witness" /&gt;

In his examination of Chambers's conversion from the political left to the right, author Daniel Oppenheimer noted that Chambers substituted his passion for communism for a passion for God. Chambers saw the world in black and white terms both before his defection and after. In his autobiography, he presented his devotion to communism as a reason for living, but after defecting saw his actions as being part of an "absolute evil." &lt;ref name="newyorker" /&gt;

===Berle meeting===
[[File:Adolf Augustus Berle NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|[[Adolf A. Berle]] (circa 1965), who ignored Chambers's report in 1939]]

The August 1939 [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Hitler–Stalin non-aggression pact]] drove Chambers to take action against the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tanenhaus|1998|pp=159–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1939, at the urging of anti-Communist, Russian-born journalist [[Isaac Don Levine]], Chambers and Levine met with Assistant Secretary of State [[Adolf A. Berle]]. Levine had introduced Chambers to [[Walter Krivitsky]], who was already informing American and British authorities about Soviet agents who held posts in both governments. Krivitsky told Chambers it was their duty to inform.  Chambers agreed to reveal what he knew on the condition of immunity from prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weinstein|1997|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the meeting, which took place at Berle's home, [[Woodley Mansion]] in Washington, Chambers named 18 current and former government employees as spies or Communist sympathizers. Many names mentioned held relatively minor posts or were already under suspicion. Some names, however, were more significant and surprising: Alger Hiss, his brother Donald Hiss, and Laurence Duggan—who were all respected, mid-level officials in the State Department—and [[Lauchlin Currie]], a special assistant to [[Franklin Roosevelt]]. Another person named had worked on a top secret bombsight project at the [[Aberdeen Proving Grounds]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Berle found Chambers's information tentative, unclear, and uncorroborated. He took the information to the White House, but the President dismissed it, to which Berle made little if any objection. Berle kept his notes, however (later, evidence during Hiss's perjury trials).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tanenhaus|1998|pp=163, 203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berle notified the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) of Chambers's information in March 1940. In February 1941, Krivitsky was found dead in his hotel room. While police ruled the death a suicide, it was widely speculated that Krivitsky had been killed by Soviet intelligence. Worried that the Soviets might try to kill Chambers too, Berle again told the FBI about his interview with Chambers. The FBI interviewed Chambers in May 1942 and June 1945, but took no immediate action, in line with the political orientation of the United States, which viewed the potential threat from the [[USSR]] as minor, when compared to that of [[Nazi Germany]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Only in November 1945, when [[Elizabeth Bentley]] defected and corroborated much of Chambers's story, did the FBI begin to take Chambers seriously).&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Clare Boothe Luce and Henry Luce NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henry Luce]] and [[Clare Boothe Luce]] (here circa 1954) valued Chambers's writing]]

By the time of the Berle meeting, Chambers had come out of hiding after a year and joined the staff of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (April 1939).  He landed a cover story within a month on [[James Joyce]]'s latest book, ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

When Fixx suffered a heart attack in October 1942, [[Wilder Hobson]] succeeded him as Chambers's assistant editor in Arts &amp; Entertainment. Other writers working for Chambers in that section included: novelist [[Nigel Dennis]], future ''New York Times'' Book Review editor [[Harvey Breit]], and poets [[Howard Moss]] and [[Weldon Kees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tanenhaus|1998|pp=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During this time, a struggle arose between those, like [[Theodore H. White]] and [[Richard Lauterbach]],  who raised criticism of what they saw as the elitism, corruption and ineptitude of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s regime in China and advocated greater cooperation with Mao's Red Army in the struggle against Japanese imperialism, and Chambers and others like [[Willi Schlamm]] who adhered to a staunchly pro-Chiang, anti-communist perspective (and who both later joined the founding editorial board of [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]]'s ''[[National Review]]''). ''Time'' founder [[Henry Luce]], who grew up in China and was a personal friend of Chiang and [[Soong Mei-ling|his wife]], came down squarely on the side of Chambers to the point that White complained that his stories were being censored, and even suppressed in their entirety, and left Time shortly after the war as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

By early 1948, Chambers had become one of the best known writer-editors at ''Time''.  First had come his scathing commentary "The Ghosts on the Roof" (March 5, 1945) on the [[Yalta Conference]] (in which Hiss partook).  Subsequent cover-story essays profiled [[Marian Anderson]], [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], [[Rebecca West]] and [[Reinhold Niebuhr]].  The cover story on [[Marian Anderson]] ("Religion: In Egypt Land", December 30, 1946) proved so popular that the magazine broke its rule of non-attribution in response to readers' letters:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most Time cover stories are written and edited by the regular staffs of the section in which they appear. Certain cover stories, that present special difficulties or call for a special literary skill, are written by Senior Editor Whittaker Chambers.&lt;ref&gt;

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 1945 letter to ''Time'' colleague [[Charles Wertenbaker]], [[Time-Life]] deputy editorial director [[John Shaw Billings (editor)|John Shaw Billings]] said of Chambers, "Whit puts on the best show in words of any writer we've ever had ... a superb technician, particularly skilled in the mosaic art of putting a ''Time'' section together."&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Alger Hiss (1950).jpg|thumb|right|[[Alger Hiss]] (1948) denied Chambers's allegations and was convicted of perjury.]]

On August 3, 1948, Chambers was called to testify before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC). There he gave the names of individuals he said were part of the underground "Ware group" in the late 1930s, including [[Alger Hiss]]. He thus once again named Hiss as a member of the Communist Party, but did not yet make any accusations of espionage. In subsequent HUAC sessions, Hiss testified and initially denied that he knew anyone by the name of Chambers, but on seeing him in person (and after it became clear that Chambers knew details about Hiss's life), said that he had known Chambers under the name "George Crosley". Hiss denied that he had ever been a Communist, however. Since Chambers still presented no evidence, the committee had initially been inclined to take the word of Hiss on the matter. However, committee member [[Richard Nixon]] received secret information from the FBI which had led him to pursue the issue. When it issued its report, HUAC described Hiss's testimony as "vague and evasive".

The country quickly became divided over the Hiss–Chambers issue. President [[Harry S. Truman]], not pleased with the allegation that the man who had presided over the United Nations Charter Conference was a Communist, dismissed the case as a "[[red herring]]".&lt;ref name=Linder&gt;

In the atmosphere of increasing anti-communism that would later be termed [[McCarthyism]], many conservatives viewed the Hiss case as emblematic of what they saw as Democrats' laxity towards the danger of communist infiltration and influence in the State Department. Many liberals, in turn, saw the Hiss case as part of the desperation of the Republican party to regain the office of president, having been out of power for 16 years. Truman also issued [[Executive Order 9835]], which initiated a program of loyalty reviews for federal employees in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://trumanlibrary.org/executiveorders/index.php?pid=502 | title = Executive Order 9835 Prescribing Procedures For The Administration Of An Employees Loyalty Program In The Executive Branch Of The Government | last = Truman | first = Harry | date = 21 March 1947 | website = The Harry S.

==="Pumpkin Papers"===

Hiss filed a $75,000 libel suit against Chambers on October 8, 1948. Under pressure from Hiss's lawyers, Chambers finally retrieved his envelope of evidence and presented it to the HUAC after they subpoenaed them. It contained four notes in Alger Hiss's handwriting, sixty-five typewritten copies of State Department documents and five strips of microfilm, some of which contained photographs of State Department documents. The press came to call these the "Pumpkin Papers" referring to the fact that Chambers had briefly hidden the microfilm in a hollowed-out pumpkin. These documents indicated that Hiss knew Chambers long after mid-1936, when Hiss said he had last seen "Crosley," and also that Hiss had engaged in espionage with Chambers. Chambers explained his delay in producing this evidence as an effort to spare an old friend from more trouble than necessary. Until October 1948, Chambers had repeatedly stated that Hiss had ''not'' engaged in espionage, even when Chambers testified under oath. Chambers was forced to testify at the Hiss trials that he had committed perjury several times, which reduced his credibility in the eyes of his critics.

The five rolls of 35&amp;nbsp;mm film known as the "pumpkin papers" were thought until late 1974 to be locked in HUAC files. Independent researcher [[Stephen Salant|Stephen W. Salant]], an economist at the University of Michigan, sued the U.S. Justice Department in 1975 when his request for access to them under the Freedom of Information Act was denied. On July 31, 1975, as a result of this lawsuit and follow-on suits filed by Peter Irons and by Alger Hiss and William Reuben, the Justice Department released copies of the "pumpkin papers" that had been used to implicate Hiss. One roll of film turned out to be totally blank due to overexposure, two others are faintly legible copies of nonclassified Navy Department documents relating to such subjects as life rafts and fire extinguishers, and the remaining two are photographs of the State Department documents introduced by the prosecution at the two Hiss trials, relating to U.S./German relations in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;

This story, however, as reported by the ''New York Times'' in the 1970s, contains only a partial truth.  The blank roll had been mentioned by Chambers in his autobiography ''Witness.''  But in addition to innocuous farm reports, etc., the documents on the other pumpkin patch microfilms also included "confidential memos sent from overseas embassies to diplomatic staff in Washington, D.C.";&lt;ref name="c-span.org video"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tanenhaus|first1=Sam|title=c-cpan interview, 5/26/02|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?170139-1/writings-whittaker-chambers|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; worse, those memos had originally been transmitted in code, which, thanks to their (presumably) having both coded originals and the translations forwarded by Hiss, the Soviets now could easily understand.&lt;ref name="c-span.org video" /&gt;

===Perjury===
Hiss could not be tried for espionage at that time, because the evidence indicated the offense had occurred more than ten years prior to that time, and the [[statute of limitations]] for espionage was five years. Instead, Hiss was indicted for two counts of [[perjury]] relating to testimony he had given before a [[Grand jury|federal grand jury]] the previous December. There he had denied giving any documents to Whittaker Chambers, and testified he had not seen Chambers after mid-1936.

Hiss was tried twice for perjury. The first trial, in June 1949, ended with the jury deadlocked eight to four for conviction. In addition to Chambers's testimony, a government expert testified that other papers typed on a typewriter belonging to the Hiss family matched the secret papers produced by Chambers. An impressive array of [[character witnesses]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; appeared on behalf of Hiss: two U.S. Supreme Court justices, [[Felix Frankfurter]] and [[Stanley Forman Reed|Stanley Reed]], former Democratic presidential nominee [[John W. Davis]] and future Democratic presidential nominee [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]]. Chambers, on the other hand, was attacked by Hiss's attorneys as "an enemy of the Republic, a blasphemer of Christ, a disbeliever in God, with no respect for matrimony or motherhood".&lt;ref name=Linder/&gt; In the second trial, Hiss's defense produced a psychiatrist who characterized Chambers as a "[[psychopath]]ic&lt;nowiki/&gt; personality" and "a [[pathological liar]]".&lt;ref&gt;
{{Harvnb|Weinstein|1997|pp=487, 493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second trial ended in January 1950 with Hiss found guilty on both counts of perjury. He was sentenced to [[Alger Hiss#Incarceration|five years in prison]].

==After the Hiss case==

Chambers had resigned from ''Time'' in December 1948.  After the Hiss Case, he wrote a few articles for ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', and ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazines.&lt;ref name="Witness"/&gt;

In 1951 during HUAC hearings, William Spiegel of Baltimore identified a photo of "Carl Schroeder" as Whittaker Chambers while he was describing his involvement with David Zimmerman, a spy in Chambers' network.&lt;ref&gt;

According to commentator [[George Will]] in 2017:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Witness'' became a canonical text of conservatism. Unfortunately, it injected conservatism with a sour, whiney, complaining, crybaby populism. It is the screechy and dominant tone of the loutish faux conservatism that today is erasing [William F.]  Buckley's legacy of infectious cheerfulness and unapologetic embrace of high culture.  Chambers wallowed in cloying sentimentality and curdled resentment about "the plain men and women" — "my people, humble people, strong in common sense, in common goodness" — enduring the "musk of snobbism" emanating from the "socially formidable circles" of the "nicest people" produced by "certain collegiate eyries."&lt;ref&gt;George F. Will, "Conservatism is soiled by scowling primitives," [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/conservatism-is-soiled-by-scowling-primitives/2017/05/31/786317a8-4559-11e7-a196-a1bb629f64cb_story.html?hpid=hp_no-name_opinion-card-a%3Ahomepage%2Fstory ''Washington Post May 31, 2017][&lt;/ref&gt;

They then underwent a stormy courtship that faced resistance from their comrades, with Chambers having climbed through her window at five o'clock in the morning to propose. Shemitz identified as "a [[pacifist]] rather than a revolutionary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Forth-Bargy.gif|thumb|Baronies of Forth and Bargy in [[County Wexford]], Ireland]]

The '''Yola people''' were an [[ethnic group]] that formed in the baronies of Forth and Bargy in [[County Wexford]] after the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] at [[Bannow Bay]] in 1169. They were descendents of the original Norman invaders and hence they were distinct from the rest of Ireland in their customs, manners and appearance. As time progressed, the Yola people became mixed with the diverse medieval ethnic mix which colonized County Wexford, including French, Norman, Danish, Welsh, English, Irish, Flemish and the original Old Norse settlers who colonized the area prior to the invasion.

==Customs, dress and manners==
The Yola people used a number of unique customs that were thought to have originated in the old [[Duchy of Normandy]]. These included [[mumming]], patrons, and the tradition of placing funeral crosses on roadway trees, which still continue to this day. They were known to be extremely law-abiding; incidents of robbery, murder and the like were seldom recorded in the baronies. 

A woman's customary dress was a lilac kircher or bonnet with ribbons, and a large frock worn as the main garment, with ribbons of various colors tying them across the waist. A man wore a waistcoat, short trousers and long socks with a hat. 

Norman utensils such as a "peeler" were used for cooking bread. Many unique dishes such as ''buskés'', a type of spiced [[corn bread]], were common in the area. 

A local custom was to take a daily afternoon nap known as an ''enteete'' in the local tongue, similar to the Spanish [[siesta]]. It was common at this time of day to cross from one end of the baronies to the other and not to see a single person on the roads.

==Language==
The [[Forth and Bargy dialect|Yola language]], also known as the Forth and Bargy dialect, was a unique dialect that formed in the baronies. It was mainly spoken in the structure of [[Old English|Old]]/[[Middle English]] but contained many loanwords from Irish, Norman-French and Old Norse. It was similar to the [[Dorset dialect]]s of West England, but its many loanwords have made it a source of major research by many academics. The language crossed the lines between [[Old Frisian]] and Old English and contained many words found only in Old Frisian. This has led some researchers to believe that it may have originated in the Frisia region (North Holland). There were also [[Flemish people|Flemish]] mercenaries who took part in the 1169 invasions who may have contributed to the some of the [[Flemish language|Flemish]] content, but the Flemish influence on the dialect was only very little. This was spoken as the main language until the late 19th century and the [[Irish language]] never took precedence in the baronies.

==Farming==
The baronies of Forth and Bargy are quite unique in that they do not experience as harsh a climate as the rest of the country, which allows for many crops to thrive in their flat and fertile plains. The main crops grown by the Yola people were beans, peas and barley; potatoes were not relied upon as heavily as in the rest of Ireland. The farmers practised an advanced [[crop rotation]] and fertilizing system far ahead of the rest of the country. For this reason the baronies did not experience the effects of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] and actually thrived during this period by simply relying on the bean crop.

==Decline==
The Yola people eventually merged into Irish culture. Many lands were confiscated during the plantations and modern English was introduced at this time. The [[Yola language]] eventually succumbed to the same factors that killed off the [[Irish language]] in the county, which was the stigmatization of the language and the introduction of English in schools. The language was officially declared [[Extinct language|extinct]] in the 1850s. Their inhabitants still populate the majority of the baronies and many customs and words survive in the locality.

==Site description==
The two areas consist of semi-arid to arid tracts of the Upper [[Karoo]] (to the south) and the Southern [[Kalahari]] (to the north). Both areas are rich in archaeological traces inter alia of the [[Later Stone Age]], while rocky hills and outcrops in the southern area (which has been referred to as ǀXam-ka ǃxau, meaning home of the ǀXam) have a wealth of  [[rock art]] sites, preponderantly in the form of [[petroglyphs|rock engravings]].&lt;ref&gt;Deacon, J. &amp; Foster, C. 2005.

==‡Khomani San People==
The ‡Khomani San people descended from several original San groups which include the ||Ng!u (close relatives of the !Xam, who lived south of the !Gariep River), the ‡Khomani who spoke the same language as the ||Ng!u but had a distinct lineage, the |’Auni, the Khatea and  the Njamani. There are approximately 1 500 adults spread over an area of more than 1 000 square kilometres in the [[Northern Cape Province]]. Approximately 8000 people live in the northern reaches of [[Gordonia District|Gordonia]], at Witdraai, [[Welkom]] and [[Askham, Northern Cape|Askham]], just south of the [[Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park]]. Others live in the towns of Rietfontein, Upington, Loubos, Olifantshoek and other surrounding villages and settlements.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.discoverworld.com/South-Africa/Northern-Cape/%C7%80xam-and-%C7%82khomani-Heartland Accessed 2 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khomanisan.com/about-us/ Accessed 2 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

With the official proclamation of the [[Kalahari Gemsbok National Park]] in 1931, the majority of the Khomani, as well as the Mier people who lived in that area, were forced to move to other areas. Some settled at the national park headquarters in Twee Rivieran and were employed by the park. Others, who were also dispossessed of their land, dispersed into Namibia and other nearby settlements. 

The  Khomani San, as well as the Mier people (who were also relocated due to the new park), were allowed to continue living in certain areas within the park however, they lost their rights to hunt and manage stock on the land.

In 1995, the ‡Khomani San community lodged a claim for the restitution of 400 000 hectares of land in the Kalahari Gemsbok Park. After protracted negotiations, the claims were settled on 21 March 1999, with the official transfer of title to six [[Kalahari]] farms, which were approximately 34 728 hectares, to the ‡Khomani San Common Property Association (CPA). A form of collective trust allowed by the Communal Property Associations Act (No 28 of 1996) for use by communities that have benefited from land restitution under the Restitution of Land Rights Act (No. 22 of 1994). Additionally in 2007 it was agreed that a further two farms (Sonderwater and Rolletjies – approximately 6 020 hectares) were be transferred to the ‡Khomani San CPA.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/lists/new-world-heritage-sites-2017/_khomani/&lt;/ref&gt;

==!Ae!Hai Kalahari Heritage Park Agreement==
Furthermore, on the 29th May 2002 the conditional allocation of approximately 57,903 hectares of land within the Park were to be managed as a Contractual National Park, namely the !Ae!Hai Kalahari Heritage Park. This land was committed to the ownership of the ‡Khomani San and Mier communities through what is known as the !Ae!Hai Kalahari Heritage Park Agreement. In this agreement the ‡Khomani San community was also granted preferential tourism rights over 80 000 hectares south of the Auob River inside the Park, as well as the right to use 473 830 hectares of land between the Auob and Nossob Rivers for symbolic and cultural purposes. Due to increased social decay and a lack of post-restitution support from the South African government, there was no significant improvement of the livelihoods of the people since the land gains. In 2012 fifty Rotary clubs in [[Germany]] and 3 clubs in South Africa in collaboration with Peace Parks Foundation set up a project to break down the historical injustices and to give the ‡Khomani San the necessary guidance and assistance in order to create an sustainable operation system of the !Ae !Hai Kalahari Heritage Park. Furthermore, the development and operation of the joint farms which were given to them by the [[South African]] government in 1999 and 2002 after a successful land claim. The project is aimed to give the ‡Khomani San a chance to live in dignity, freedom and economic independence while retaining their traditional identity. The German Ministry for International Cooperation and Development (BMZ) joined Rotary to support the project for four years. 

One of the primary goals is the development of tourism facilities where visitors may experience the unique attributes of this arid region and its people.&lt;ref&gt; Report on the Inquiry into the Human Rights Violations in the Khomani San Community.

==World Heritage Status==
The ǀXam and ǂKhomani heartland site was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] Tentative List on May 15, 2004 in the Cultural category.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt;

The northern component, the ǂKhomani Cultural Landscape, was inscribed on the World Heritage list on 8 July 2017, during the 41st session of the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) World Heritage Committee which took place in Kraków, Poland, 2–12 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;ǂKhomani Cultural Landscape inscribed as World Heritage https://www.environment.gov.za/mediastatement/khomaniculturallandscape_aworldheritagesite&lt;/ref&gt;
