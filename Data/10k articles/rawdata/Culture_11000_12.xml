An '''acting workshop''' is  a meeting of actors or others of one specific trade to learn how to hone their skills and to [[social network|network]] with other actors, [[acting coach]]es, and casting directors.  Many actors will critique, mentor, and coach their peers and offer tips on how to improve their preparation for roles, [[audition]]s, and enhance their performing abilities. Acting workshops are often staffed by professionals, which can include acting coaches, directors, or actors. Casting directors sometimes also act as coaches. It is usually recommended that serious actors attend acting workshops to help increase their skill.

==Specialist types==
There are other types of workshops for similar kinds of performance trades. Voice actors learn how to enhance their skill of voicing a character, writers learn to how to give characters personality, and comedians can learn how to increase their comedic skill.  
==Examples==
Specialist independent workshops exist to provide the facilities required for training and providing skills courses. A good example of this is [[Dewar Studios]] in Great Titchfield Street in Central London.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4580">'''Aposiopesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|p|ə|s|aɪ|.|ə|ˈ|p|iː|s|ɪ|s}}; [[Ancient Greek|Classical Greek]]: ἀποσιώπησις, "becoming silent") is a [[figure of speech]] wherein a sentence is deliberately broken off and left unfinished, the ending to be supplied by the imagination, giving an impression of unwillingness or inability to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard A. Lanham|year=1991|title=A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms|location=Berkeley; Los Angeles, Calif.; London|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=978-0-520-07669-3|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be the threat "Get out, or else—!"  This device often portrays its users as overcome with passion (fear, anger, excitement) or [[modesty]]. To mark the occurrence of aposiopesis with punctuation, an [[Dash#Em dash|em dash]] (—) or an [[ellipsis]] (…) may be used.

==Examples==
* A classical example of aposiopesis in [[Virgil]] occurs in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' 2.100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Justice|editor=Frank Grady|others=Andrew Galloway|chapter=Chaucer's History-Effect|title=Answerable Style: The Idea of the Literary in Medieval England|series=Interventions: New Studies in Medieval Culture|publisher=[[Ohio State University Press]]|year=2013|isbn=978-0-8142-1207-3|pages=169–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinon, the Greek who is posing as a defector to deceive the Trojans into accepting the Trojan Horse within their city wall, tells about how Ulixes 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''hinc mihi prima malis labes, hinc semper Vlixes''
''criminibus terrere nouis, hinc spargere uoces''
''in uulgum ambiguas et quaerere conscius arma.''
''nec requieuit enim, donec Calchante ministro—''
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
This was the time when the first onslaught of ruin began for me.
Ulixes kept terrifying me with new accusations,
kept spreading ambiguous rumors among the people,
and kept looking for quarrel.
Nor did he in fact ever stop, until with the help of Calchas—
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* A [[Bible|biblical]] example is found in [[Psalms|Psalm]] 27, verse 13.{{refn|group=nb|Other English translations insert extra words, example "I had fainted, unless" (King James Version). Another example is "Yet I am confident that" (New Living Translation). Only the Hebrew conjunction "unless" appears&amp;nbsp;– translators add the extra words to make the phrase appear as a complete thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psalm 27:13|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/ylt/psa/27/1/s_505001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225191343/https://www.blueletterbible.org/ylt/psa/27/1/s_505001|archivedate=25 February 2016|work=[[Blue Letter Bible]] ([[Young's Literal Translation]])|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} it says: "Unless I had believed I would see the goodness of the [[God|Lord]] in the land of the living …" The implication is that the author does not know what he would have done.
* King Lear, overcome by anger at his daughters, says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
No, you unnatural hags,
I will have such revenges on you both,
That all the world shall— I will do such things,—
What they are, yet I know not:  but they shall be
The terrors of the earth. ([[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], ''[[King Lear]]'', II.iv)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Aposiopesis also occurs at the agitated climax of Mercutio's "[[Queen Mab]]" speech, resulting in a calming intervention by Romeo:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''Mercutio''. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
              That presses them and learns them first to bear,
              Making them women of good carriage:
              This is she—

''Romeo''.    Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!  
              Thou talk'st of nothing. (Shakespeare, ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', I.iv)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

==Grammatical definition==
In syntax, an aposiopesis arises when the "if" clause ([[Protasis (linguistics)|protasis]]) of a [[conditional sentence|condition]] is stated without an ensuing "then" clause, or [[apodosis (linguistics)|apodosis]]. Because an aposiopesis implies a trailing off of thought, it is never directly followed by a period, which would effectively result in four consecutive dots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert Weir Smyth|title=Greek Grammar|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=1920|isbn=978-0-674-36250-5|pages=674}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{examples needed|date=April 2013}}

'''Cabinets of curiosities''' (also known in [[German language|German]] loanwords as '''Kunstkabinett''', '''Kunstkammer''' or '''Wunderkammer'''; also '''Cabinets of Wonder''', and '''wonder-rooms''') were encyclopedic collections of objects the categorical boundaries of which were, in [[Renaissance]] [[Europe]], yet to be defined. Modern terminology would categorize the objects included as belonging to [[natural history]] (sometimes faked), [[geology]], [[ethnography]], [[archaeology]], religious or historical [[relic]]s, works of art (including  [[cabinet painting]]s), and [[antiquities]]. "The Kunstkammer was regarded as a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] or theater of the world, and a memory theater. The Kunstkammer conveyed symbolically the patron's control of the world through its indoor, microscopic reproduction."&lt;ref&gt;Francesaco Fiorani, reviewing Bredecamp 1995 in ''Renaissance Quarterly'' '''51'''.1  (Spring 1998:268-270) p 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Of [[Charles I of England]]'s collection, Peter Thomas states succinctly, "The ''Kunstkabinett'' itself was a form of propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, "Charles I of England: The tragedy of Absolutism", A.G. Dickens, ed. ''The Courts of Europe'' (London) 1977:201.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the most famous, best documented cabinets of rulers and aristocrats, members of the merchant class and early practitioners of [[science]] in [[Europe]] formed collections that were precursors to [[museum]]s.

The term ''[[Cabinet (architecture)|cabinet]]'' originally described a room rather than a [[Cabinet (furniture)|piece of furniture]]. The classic cabinet of curiosities emerged in the sixteenth century, although more rudimentary collections had existed earlier. The Kunstkammer of [[Rudolf&amp;nbsp;II, Holy Roman Emperor]] (ruled 1576–1612), housed in the [[Hradschin]] at Prague, was unrivalled north of the Alps; it provided a solace and retreat for contemplation&lt;ref&gt;This is the secretive aspect emphasised by R.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;W. Evans, ''Rudolf&amp;nbsp;II and His World: A Study in Intellectual History'' (Oxford) 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; that also served to demonstrate his imperial magnificence and power in symbolic arrangement of their display, ceremoniously presented to visiting diplomats and magnates.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann, "Remarks on the Collections of Rudolf&amp;nbsp;II: The Kunstkammer as a Form of Representatio",&lt;!--Representatio is correct--&gt; ''Art Journal'' '''38'''.1 (Autumn 1978:22–28).&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf's uncle, [[Ferdinand&amp;nbsp;II, Archduke of Austria]], also had a collection, with a special emphasis on paintings of people with interesting deformities, which remains largely intact as the [[Chamber of Art and Curiosities]] at [[Ambras Castle]] in Austria.

==History==
[[Image:RitrattoMuseoFerranteImperato.jpg|thumb|left|Fold-out engraving from [[Ferrante Imperato]]'s ''Dell'Historia Naturale'' (Naples 1599), the earliest illustration of a natural history cabinet]]
[[Image:Frans Francken d. J. 009.jpg|thumb|left|A corner of a cabinet, painted by [[Frans II Francken]] in 1636 reveals the range of connoisseurship a Baroque-era ''[[virtuoso]]'' might evince]]
The earliest pictorial record of a natural history cabinet is the engraving in [[Ferrante Imperato]]'s ''Dell'Historia Naturale'' (Naples 1599) (''illustration, left''). It serves to authenticate its author's credibility as a source of natural history information, in showing his open bookcases at the right, in which many volumes are stored lying down and stacked, in the medieval fashion, or with their spines upward, to protect the pages from dust. Some of the volumes doubtless represent his [[herbarium]]. Every surface of the vaulted ceiling is occupied with preserved fishes, stuffed mammals and curious shells, with a stuffed crocodile suspended in the centre. Examples of corals stand on the bookcases. At the left, the room is fitted out like a ''studiolo''&lt;ref&gt;''Studiolo'': the small retreats in the palaces of Urbino and Gubbio were inlaid with [[intarsia]] that figured just such fitted cabinets with feigned lattice doors and shelves filled with scientific instruments, books and small sculptures in ''trompe-l'oeil'' perspective. The Gubbio ''studiolo'' has been reassembled at the [[Metropolitan Museum]]; the Urbino ''studiolo'' remains in situ.&lt;/ref&gt; with a range of built-in cabinets whose fronts can be unlocked and let down to reveal intricately fitted nests of pigeonholes forming architectural units, filled with small mineral specimens.&lt;ref&gt;Sixteenth-century cabinet-makers serving the luxury trades of [[Florence]] and [[Antwerp]] were beginning to produce moveable cabinets with similar architectural interior fittings, which could be set upon a carpet-covered table or on a purpose-built stand.&lt;/ref&gt; Above them, stuffed birds stand against panels inlaid with square polished stone samples, doubtless marbles and jaspers or fitted with pigeonhole compartments for specimens. Below them, a range of cupboards contain specimen boxes and covered jars.

In 1587 Gabriel Kaltemarckt advised [[Christian&amp;nbsp;I of Saxony]] that three types of item were indispensable in forming a "Kunstkammer" or art collection: firstly sculptures and paintings; secondly "curious items from home or abroad"; and thirdly "antlers, horns, claws, feathers and other things belonging to strange and curious animals".&lt;ref&gt;B. Gutfleish and J. Menzhausen, "How a Kunstkammer Should Be Formed", ''Journal of the History of Collections'', 1989 Vol I: p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Albrecht Dürer]] visited the [[Netherlands]] in 1521, apart from artworks he sent back to [[Nuremberg]] various animal horns, a piece of [[coral]], some large fish fins and a wooden weapon from the [[East Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor, ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos 48.{{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highly characteristic range of interests represented in  [[Frans II Francken]]'s painting of 1636 (''illustration, left'') shows paintings on the wall that range from landscapes, including a moonlit scene—a genre in itself—to a portrait and a religious picture (the ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'') intermixed with preserved tropical marine fish and a string of carved beads, most likely [[amber]], which is both precious and a natural curiosity. Sculpture both classical and secular (the sacrificing ''Libera'', a Roman fertility goddess)&lt;ref&gt;Her base is inscribed LIBER[A]&lt;/ref&gt; on the one hand and modern and religious (''Christ at the Column''&lt;ref&gt;It appears to represent a reduction of a well-known sculpture by [[Alessandro Algardi]].&lt;/ref&gt;) are represented, while on the table are ranged, among the exotic shells (including some tropical ones and a shark's tooth): [[portrait miniature]]s, gem-stones mounted with pearls in a curious quatrefoil box, a set of sepia [[Chiaroscuro|chiaroscuro woodcuts]] or drawings, and a small [[still-life]] painting&lt;ref&gt;Still life was considered a [[hierarchy of genres|lesser genre]] than even portraits or landscapes.&lt;/ref&gt; leaning against a flower-piece, coins and medals—presumably Greek and Roman—and Roman terracotta oil-lamps, a Chinese-style brass lock, curious flasks, and a blue-and-white Ming porcelain bowl.

Two of the most famously described seventeenth-century cabinets were those of [[Ole Worm]], known as Olaus Wormius (1588–1654) (''illustration, above right''), and [[Athanasius Kircher]] (1602–1680). These seventeenth-century cabinets were filled with preserved animals, horns, tusks, skeletons, minerals, as well as other interesting man-made objects: sculptures wondrously old, wondrously fine or wondrously small; clockwork [[automaton|automata]]; ethnographic specimens from exotic locations. Often they would contain a mix of fact and fiction, including apparently [[mythology|mythical]] creatures. Worm's collection contained, for example, what he thought was a [[Vegetable Lamb of Tartary|Scythian Lamb]], a woolly [[fern]] thought to be a plant/sheep fabulous creature. However he was also responsible for identifying the [[narwhal]]'s tusk as coming from a whale rather than a [[unicorn]], as most owners of these believed. The specimens displayed were often collected during exploring expeditions and trading voyages.
[[File:Celestial globe with clockwork MET DP237684.jpg|thumb|right|Celestial globe with clockwork, made for the Kunstkammer of Rudolf&amp;nbsp;II, 1579]]
In the second half of the 18th century, [[Belsazar Hacquet]] (c. 1735–1815) operated in [[Ljubljana]], then the capital of [[Carniola]], a natural history cabinet ({{lang-de|Naturalienkabinet}}) that was appreciated throughout Europe and was visited by the highest nobility, including the Holy Roman Emperor, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the Russian grand duke [[Paul I of Russia|Paul]] and [[Pope Pius VI]], as well as by famous naturalists, such as {{Interlanguage link multi|Francesco Griselini|it}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Franz Benedikt Hermann|de|3=Franz Benedikt Hermann (Geologe)}}. It included a number of minerals, including specimens of mercury from the [[Idrija mercury mine|Idrija mine]], a ''[[herbarium vivum]]'' with over 4,000 specimens of Carniolan and foreign plants, a smaller number of animal specimens, a natural history and medical library, and an [[anatomical theatre]].&lt;ref name=Jezernik&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-IARZL5AU |title=Ljubljanske »knjige sveta« od Auerspergov do Hacqueta |first=Božidar |last=Jezernik |year=2009 |language=Slovenian, English|trans-title=Ljubljana's "Books of the World" – from the Auerspergs to Hacquet |journal=Etnolog |id={{COBISS|ID=1242502}} |volume=19=70 |pages=23–33 |issn=0354-0316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabinets of curiosities would often serve scientific advancement when images of their contents were published. The catalog of Worm's collection, published as the ''Museum Wormianum'' (1655), used the collection of artifacts as a starting point for Worm's speculations on philosophy, science, natural history, and more.

Cabinets of curiosities were limited to those who could afford to create and maintain them. Many [[monarch]]s, in particular, developed large collections. A rather under-used example, stronger in art than other areas, was the [[Studiolo of Francesco&amp;nbsp;I]], the first Medici Grand-Duke of Tuscany. [[Frederick&amp;nbsp;III of Denmark]], who added Worm's collection to his own after Worm's death, was another such monarch. A third example is the [[Kunstkamera]] founded by [[Peter the Great]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1714. Many items were bought in Amsterdam from [[Albertus Seba]] and [[Frederik Ruysch]]. The fabulous [[Habsburg]] Imperial collection included important [[Aztec]] artifacts, including the [[Montezuma's headdress|feather head-dress]] or crown of [[Moctezuma II|Montezuma]] now in the [[Vienna Museum of Ethnology|Museum of Ethnology, Vienna]].

Similar collections on a smaller scale were the complex ''Kunstschränke'' produced in the early seventeenth century by the [[Augsburg]] merchant, diplomat and collector [[Philipp Hainhofer]]. These were cabinets in the sense of pieces of furniture, made from all imaginable exotic and expensive materials and filled with contents and ornamental details intended to reflect the entire cosmos on a miniature scale. The best preserved example is the one given by the city of Augsburg to King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] in 1632, which is kept in the [[Gustavianum|Museum Gustavianum]] in [[Uppsala]]. The [[curio cabinet]], as a modern single piece of furniture, is a version of the grander historical examples.

The juxtaposition of such disparate objects, according to Horst Bredekamp's analysis (Bredekamp 1995), encouraged comparisons, finding analogies and parallels and favoured the cultural change from a world viewed as static to a dynamic view of endlessly transforming natural history and a historical perspective that led in the seventeenth century to the germs of a scientific view of reality.

A late example of the juxtaposition of natural materials with richly worked artifice is provided by the [[Grünes Gewölbe]], the "Green Vaults" formed by [[Augustus the Strong]] in [[Dresden]] to display his chamber of wonders.  The "Enlightenment Gallery" in the [[British Museum]], installed in the former "Kings Library" room in 2003 to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the museum, aims to recreate the abundance and diversity that still characterized museums in the mid-eighteenth century, mixing shells, rock samples and botanical specimens with a great variety of artworks and other man-made objects from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/galleries/themes/room_1_enlightenment.aspx |title=Enlightenment Gallery at the British Museum |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In seventeenth-century parlance, both French and English, a ''cabinet'' came to signify a collection of works of art, which might still also include an assembly objects of ''[[virtù]]'' or curiosities, such as a ''[[virtuoso]]'' would find intellectually stimulating. In 1714, [[Michael Bernhard Valentini]] published an early [[Museology|museological]] work, ''Museum Museorum'', an account of the cabinets known to him with catalogues of their contents.

Some strands of the early universal collections, the bizarre or freakish biological specimens, whether genuine or fake, and the more exotic historical objects, could find a home in commercial [[freak show]]s and [[sideshows]].

[[Sir Hans Sloane]] (1660–1753) was an English physician, a member of the [[Royal Society]] and the [[Royal College of Physicians]], and the founder of the [[British Museum]] in London. He began sporadically collecting plants in England and France while studying medicine. In 1687, the [[Duke of Albemarle]] offered Sloane a position as personal physician to the West Indies fleet at Jamaica. He accepted and spent fifteen months collecting and cataloguing the native plants, animals, and artificial curiosities (e.g. cultural artifacts of native and African populations) of Jamaica. This became the basis for his two volume work, ''Natural History of Jamaica'', published in 1707 and 1725. Sloane returned to England in 1689 with over eight hundred specimens of plants, which were live or mounted on heavy paper in an eight-volume herbarium. He also attempted to bring back live animals (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;snakes, an alligator, and an iguana) but they all died before reaching England.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Edward P.

" Sir Hans Sloane and Abbé Jean Paul Bignon: Notes on Collection Building in the Eighteenth Century," in ''The Library Quarterly'', Vol. 50, No. 4 (October 1980), 475–482; de Beer, G.&amp;nbsp;R.

Sloane meticulously cataloged and created extensive records for most of the specimens and objects in his collection. He also began to acquire other collections by gift or purchase. [[Herman Boerhaave]] gave him four volumes of plants from Boerhaave's gardens at Leiden. William Charleton, in a bequest in 1702, gave Sloane numerous books of birds, fish, flowers, and shells and his miscellaneous museum consisting of curiosities, miniatures, insects, medals, animals, minerals, precious stones and curiosities in amber. Sloane purchased [[Leonard Plukenet]]'s collection in 1710. It consisted of twenty-three volumes with over 8,000 plants from Africa, India, Japan and China. [[Mary Somerset, Duchess of Beaufort (1630–1715)]], left him a twelve-volume herbarium from her gardens at Chelsea and Badminton upon her death in 1714. Reverend [[Adam Buddle]] gave Sloane thirteen volumes of British plants. In 1716, Sloane purchased Englebert Kaempfer's volume of Japanese plants and [[James Petiver]]'s virtual museum of approximately one hundred volumes of plants from Europe, North America, Africa, the Near East, India, and the Orient. [[Mark Catesby]] gave him plants from North America and the West Indies from an expedition funded by Sloane. [[Philip Miller]] gave him twelve volumes of plants grown from the [[Chelsea Physic Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Edward P. ''Museum Masters: Their Museums and Their Influence'', (Walnut Creek, London, New Delhi: AltaMira Press, 1995), 20–42; de Beer, G. R. "Sir Hans Sloane, F.R.S 1660–1753," in ''Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London'', Vol. 10, No. 2 (April 1953), 81–84; Gray, Basil. "Sloane and the Kaempfer Collection," in ''The British Museum Quarterly'', Vol. 18, No. 1, Sir Hans Sloane (March 1953), 20–23; and "The Sloane Collection of Manuscripts" in ''The British Museum Quarterly'', Vol. 18, No. 1, Sir Hans Sloane (March 1953), 6–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloane acquired approximately three hundred and fifty artificial curiosities from North American Indians, Eskimos, South America, the Lapland, Siberia, East Indies, and the West Indies, including nine items from Jamaica.
"These ethnological artifacts were important because they established a field of collection for the British Museum that was to increase greatly with the explorations of Captain [[James Cook]] in Oceania and Australia and the rapid expansion of the [[British Empire]]."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Edward P. ''Museum Masters: Their Museums and Their Influence'', (Walnut Creek, London, New Delhi: AltaMira Press, 1995), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon his death in 1753, Sloane bequeathed his sizable collection of 337 volumes to England for £20,000. In 1759, [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]'s royal library was added to Sloane’s collection to form the foundation of the British Museum.

[[John Tradescant the elder]] (circa 1570s–1638) was a gardener, naturalist, and botanist in the employ of the Duke of Buckingham. He collected plants, bulbs, flowers, vines, berries, and fruit trees from Russia, the Levant, Algiers, France, Bermuda, the Caribbean, and the East Indies. His son, [[John Tradescant the younger]] (1608–1662) traveled to Virginia in 1637 and collected flowers, plants, shells, an Indian deerskin mantle believed to have belonged to [[Powhatan]], father of [[Pocahontas]]. Father and son, in addition to botanical specimens, collected zoological (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;the [[dodo]] from Mauritius, the upper jaw of a walrus, and armadillos), artificial curiosities (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;wampum belts, portraits, lathe turned ivory, weapons, costumes, Oriental footwear and carved alabaster panels) and rarities (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;a mermaid's hand, a dragon's egg, two feathers of a phoenix's tail, a piece of the True Cross, and a vial of blood that rained in the Isle of Wight). By the 1630s, the Tradescants displayed their eclectic collection at their residence in South Lambeth. Tradescant's Ark, as it came to be known, was the earliest major cabinet of curiosity in England and open to the public for a small entrance fee.&lt;ref name="IvinsJr"&gt;Ivins, Jr., William M. "The Tradescant Collection", in ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', Vol. 20, No. 8 (August 1925), 194–197; Josten, C.H. ''Elias Ashmole (1617–1692): His Autobiographical and Historical Notes, His Correspondence, and Other Contemporary Sources Relating to His Life and Work: Texts, 1661–1672'', (Oxford: Clarendon, 1967); Leith-Ross, Prudence.

''Strange Blooms: The Curious Lives and Adventures of the John Tradescants'', (London: Atlantic, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elias Ashmole]] (1617–1692) was a lawyer, chemist, antiquarian, [[Freemason]], and a member of the Royal Society with a keen interest in [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], and botany. Ashmole was also a neighbor of the Tradescants in Lambeth. He financed the publication of ''Musaeum Tradescantianum'', a catalogue of the Ark collection in 1656. Ashmole, a collector in his own right, acquired the Tradescant Ark in 1659 and added it to his collection of astrological, medical, and historical manuscripts. In 1675, he donated his library and collection and the Tradescant collection to the [[University of Oxford]], provided that a suitable building be provided to house the collection. Ashmole’s donation formed the foundation of the [[Ashmolean Museum]] at Oxford.&lt;ref name="IvinsJr" /&gt;

Cabinets of Curiosities can now be found at [[Snowshill Manor]] and [[Wallington Hall]]. The concept has been reinterpreted at [[The Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities, Fine Art &amp; Natural History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A two-headed lamb and ancient dildos: the UK's strangest new museum|url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/28/two-headed-lamb-ancient-dildos-uks-strangest-new-museum|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-04|first = Oliver|last = Wainwright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social function====
[[File:17th-Century Cabinet of Curiosities.jpg|thumb|left|Italian Baroque-era cabinet of curiosities, circa 1635.]]
Cabinets of curiosities served not only as collections to reflect the particular curiosities of their curators but as social devices to establish and uphold rank in society. There are said to be two main types of cabinets. As R. J. W. Evans notes, there could be "the princely cabinet, serving a largely representational function, and dominated by aesthetic concerns and a marked predilection for the exotic," or the less grandiose, "the more modest collection of the humanist scholar or virtuoso, which served more practical and scientific purposes." Evans goes on to explain that "no clear distinction existed between the two categories: all collecting was marked by curiosity, shading into credulity, and by some sort of universal underlying design".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Impey, MacGregor|first1=Oliver, Arthur|title=The Origins of Museums: The Cabinet of Curiosities in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century Europe|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to cabinets of curiosity serving as an establisher of socioeconomic status for its curator, these cabinets served as entertainment, as particularly illustrated by the proceedings of the [[Royal Society]], whose early meetings were often a sort of open floor to any Fellow to exhibit the findings his curiosities led him to. However purely educational or investigative these exhibitions may sound, it is important to note that the Fellows in this period supported the idea of “learned entertainment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fontes da Costa|first1=Palmira|title=Singular and the Making of Knowledge at the Royal Society of London in the Eighteenth Century|website=site.ebrary.com/lib/byuprovo/detail.action?docID=10677039&amp;p00=cabinet+curiosities|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;” or the alignment of learning with entertainment. This was not unusual, as the Royal Society had an earlier history of a love of the marvellous. This love was often exploited by eighteenth-century natural philosophers to secure the attention of their audience during their exhibitions.

Places of exhibitions of and places of new societies that promoted natural knowledge also seemed to culture the idea of perfect civility. Some scholars propose that this was “a reaction against the dogmatism and enthusiasm of the [[English Civil War]] and Interregum [sic].&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fontes da Costa|first1=Palmira|title=Singular and the Making of Knowledge at the Royal Society of London in the Eighteenth Century|website=site.ebrary.com/lib/byuprovo/reader.action?docID=10677039|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;” This move to politeness put bars on how one should behave and interact socially, which enabled the distinguishing of the polite from the supposed common or more vulgar members of society. Exhibitions of curiosities (as they were typically odd and foreign marvels) attracted a wide, more general audience, which “[rendered] them more suitable subjects of polite discourse at the Society.”&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"/&gt; A subject was considered less suitable for polite discourse if the curiosity being displayed was accompanied by too much other material evidence, as it allowed for less conjecture and exploration of ideas regarding the displayed curiosity. Because of this, many displays simply included a concise description of the phenomena and avoided any mention of explanation for the phenomena. Quentin Skinner describes the early Royal Society as “something much more like a gentleman’s club,&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"/&gt;” an idea supported by [[John Evelyn]], who depicts the Royal Society as “an Assembly of many honorable Gentlemen, who meete inoffensively together under his Majesty’s Royal Cognizance; and to entertaine themselves ingenously, whilst their other domestique avocations or publique business deprives them of being always in the company of learned men and that they cannot dwell forever in the Universities.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"/&gt;”

===United States===
Thomas Dent Mütter (1811–1859) was an early American pioneer of reconstructive plastic surgery. His specialty was repairing congenital anomalies, cleft lip and palates, and club foot. He also collected medical oddities, tumors, anatomical and pathological specimens, wet and dry preparations, wax models, plaster casts, and illustrations of medical deformities. This collection began as a teaching tool for young physicians. Just prior to Mütter's death in 1859, he donated 1,344 items to the [[American College of Physicians]] in Philadelphia, along with a $30,000 endowment for the maintenance and expansion of his museum. Mütter’s collection was added to ninety-two pathological specimens collected by Doctor Isaac Parrish between 1849 and 1852. The [[Mütter Museum]] began to collect antique medical equipment in 1871, including [[Benjamin Rush]]'s medical chest and [[Florence Nightingale]]'s sewing kit. In 1874 the museum acquired one hundred human skulls from Austrian anatomist and phrenologist, [[Joseph Hyrtl]] (1810–1894); a nineteenth-century corpse, dubbed the "soap lady"; the conjoined liver and death cast of [[Chang and Eng Bunker]], the Siamese twins; and in 1893, [[Grover Cleveland]]'s jaw tumor. The Mütter Museum is an excellent example of a nineteenth-century grotesque cabinet of medical curiosities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collphyphil.org/Site/mutter_museum.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304022221/http://www.collphyphil.org/Site/mutter_museum.html |date=March 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mundieart.com/cabinet/ |title=James G.

[[P.&amp;nbsp;T. Barnum]] took over [[Barnum's American Museum]] on five floors in New York, "perpetuating into the 1860s the Wunderkammer tradition of curiosities for gullible, often slow-moving throngs—Barnum's famously sly but effective method of crowd control was to post a sign, "THIS WAY TO THE EGRESS!" at the exit door".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324407504578185622576715416?mod=WSJ_article_MoreIn_Life%26Culture "Catalog of Curiosities"] by BARRYMORE LAURENCE SCHERER Wall Street Journal.

In 1908, New York businessmen formed the [[Hobby Club]], a dining club limited to 50 men, in order to showcase their "cabinets of wonder" and their selected collections. These included literary specimens and [[incunable]]; antiquities such as ancient armour; precious stones and geological items of interest. Annual formal dinners would be used to open the various collections up to inspection for the other members of the club.&lt;ref&gt;According to its constitution, "This Club shall be called THE HOBBY CLUB. The object of the Club shall be to encourage the collection of literary, artistic and scientific works; to aid in the development of literary, artistic and scientific matters; to promote social and literary intercourse among its members, and the discussion and consideration of various literary and economic subjects."[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101060744370 Annals of the Hobby Club of New York City, 1912–1920].&lt;/ref&gt;

==In contemporary culture==
[[Image:My Cabinet o'Curiosities1.jpg|thumb|right|upright||Modern interpretation of a Wunderkammer]]

The Houston Museum of Natural Science houses a hands-on Cabinet of Curiosities, complete with taxidermied crocodile embedded in the ceiling a la Ferrante Imperato's Dell'Historia Naturale. In [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], the modern-day [[Museum of Jurassic Technology]] anachronistically seeks to recreate the sense of wonder that the old cabinets of curiosity once aroused.&lt;ref&gt;The American writer Lawrence Weschler, wrote an entire book about the museum: ''Mr. Wilson's Cabinet Of Wonder: Pronged Ants, Horned Humans, Mice on Toast, and Other Marvels of Jurassic Technology'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]], the house and museum of Alex Jordan, known as [[House on the Rock]], can also be interpreted as a modern day curiosity cabinet, especially in the collection and display of automatons. In [[Bristol, Rhode Island]], [[Musée Patamécanique]] is presented as a hybrid between an automaton theater and a cabinet of curiosities and contains works representing the field of Patamechanics, an artistic practice and area of study chiefly inspired by [['Pataphysics|Pataphysics]]. The idea of a cabinet of curiosities has also appeared in recent publications and performances. For example, ''[[Cabinet (magazine)|Cabinet]]'' magazine is a quarterly magazine that juxtaposes apparently unrelated cultural artifacts and phenomena to show their interconnectedness in ways that encourage curiosity about the world. The Italian cultural association Wunderkamern&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wunderkammern.net// Wunderkammern] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325091444/http://www.wunderkammern.net/ |date=2008-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the theme of historical cabinets of curiosities to explore how "amazement" is manifested within today's artistic discourse. The May of 2008, the University of Leeds Fine Art BA programme hosted a show called "Wunder Kammer", the culmination of research and practice from students, which allowed viewers to encounter work from across all disciplines, ranging from intimate installation to thought-provoking video and highly skilled drawing, punctuated by live performances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120918075929/http://www.wunder-kammer.com/ wunder-kamer.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several internet bloggers describe their sites as a wunderkammern either because they are primarily made up of links to things that are interesting, or because they inspire wonder in a similar manner to the original wunderkammern (see External Links, below). The researcher Robert Gehl describes such internet video sites as [[YouTube]] as modern-day wunderkammern, although in danger of being refined into capitalist institutions "just as professionalized curators refined Wunderkammers into the modern museum in the 18th century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gehl|first=Robert W.|title=Youtube As Archive: Who Will Curate This Digital Wunderkammer?|journal=International Journal of Cultural Studies|year=2009|volume=12|issue=1|pages=43–60|doi=10.1177/1367877908098854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cassock-alb''' or '''cassalb''' is a relatively modern garment and is a combination of the traditional [[cassock]] and [[alb]]. It developed as a convenient undergarment worn by clergy and as an alternative to the [[alb]] for [[deacon]]s and [[acolyte]]s.

A white or off-white cassock-alb has replaced the traditional [[cassock]] and [[alb]] in some [[Anglican]] churches since the 1970s. This garment is not the same as the [[chasuble-alb]], which is approved for use in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in certain circumstances.{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

Earlier, these paintings were prevalent across Andhra, as also various other parts of the country, albeit flavoured with their distinct styles and other local peculiarities dictated by the local customs and traditions. In the same way, [[Cheriyal]] scrolls must have been popular across [[Telangana]] in earlier times, though with the advent of television, cinemas and computers it has been fenced into its last outpost, the [[Cheriyal]] town.

[[File:Cherial 1.jpg|thumbnail|A contemporary Cheriyal Scroll painting]]

==History==
Scroll paintings have a rich history and play an important role in the Asian artistic tradition. In China, scroll paintings were part of the sophisticated traditions of the nobility and the courts. In India however, the scroll painting was the prerogative of the itinerant bard and the village artist, in essence a folk tradition of the villages.

In India, each region and village developed its own scroll painting traditions, marked by characteristic content, form and technique depending on the local ethos, patronage and socio-economic conditions. Rajasthan is known for its ''Pabuji ki Pad'', ''Devenarayana katha'' as also stories from the legend of ''Dhola and Maru''. Goa evolved the ''Dasavathara'', as Maharashtra did ''Pinguli'' and the ''Chitra Katha'' traditions. Maharashtra and Gujarat are also known for a sophisticated scroll painting tradition called the ''Prasasti Patra''. Orissa and Bengal are famous for their ''Patachitra'' traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Scroll Paintings of Bengal: Art in the Village By Amitabh Sengupta published by AuthorHouse&lt;/ref&gt;

While the above-mentioned traditions could have significantly influenced the Cheriyal scroll paintings and artists, the [[Cheriyal]] paintings were and continue to be a distinctly local invention, peculiar to the [[Telangana]] region, drawing mainly on local traditions. It can safely be said that the local temple art traditions and the [[Kalamkari]] tradition across [[Telangana]] in particular, and the graphic art traditions of the Deccan and South India in general were the major influences that shaped and guided the art of scroll paintings. However, it should also be remembered that the sphere of activity, subject and artistic idiom of every scroll painting including that of Cheriyal is peculiar and confined to the village or habitment.

To quote from A. L. Dallaiccola's South Indian Paintings- A catalogue of the British Museum collection - ''Although in the past the majority of Indian people might have been illiterate, they were not uneducated. They were taught the principles ruling their religious and social life through the recitation of stories drawn from the epics, the puranas and other religious texts... In the past, the retelling of these stories provided the education of the unlettered, and the discourses were accompanied by visual aids: scrolls, painted cloth hangings, sets of paintings, and wooden boxes with folding, concertina-like doors painted with scenes from the 'career' of a deity, such as the portable shrine from [[Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh|Tirupati]] that is now in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]]... The earliest known reference to the picture showmen is found in [[Patanjali]]'s ''Mahabhashya'' (2nd century BC). Commenting on the passage on the historic present in [[A. R. Raja Raja Varma|Panini]]'s grammar, the ''Ashtadhyayi'' (c. 5th century BC), [[Patanjali]] takes as an example some picture showmen who are discussing the killing of Kamsa at the hands of Krishna... There is also a specific mention of a picture showing Kamsa being dragged by the hair and beaten by Krishna. Numerous references to picture showmen and painted scrolls occur in literary sources. The scrolls showing the torments of hell, ''yamapattaka'', seem to have been particularly popular.''&lt;ref name="MuseumDallapiccola2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=British Museum|author2=Anna Libera Dallapiccola|title=South Indian Paintings: A Catalogue of the British Museum Collection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIzWapiacQcC&amp;pg=PA78|publisher=Mapin Publishing Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-0-7141-2424-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mandhets were the itinerant bards and performers of Andhra Pradesh while the Nakashis were the artists. The Nakashis of [[Telangana]] also made dolls, much like the [[Kinnal]] dolls of Karnataka, in addition to the painted scrolls. These scrolls were a very important part of the sociological and cultural setting of [[Telangana]]. As these paintings are now confined to [[Cheriyal]] village, they are called [[Cheriyal]] scrolls. In earlier times, the scrolls were a colourful backdrop to the equally interesting oral traditions of the common people, - the village hajjam-barber, toddy tapper, dhobhi-washerman, chamar-leatherworker, fisherman, weaver and farmer: (''Madiga, Goud, Mudiraju, Malas, Padmashali, Chakala and Mangali''&lt;ref&gt;Folk Painting Traditions of India by Sarita Chauhan Booklet series - 52 published by Institute for Social Democracy http://www.isd.net.in/Publication/Booklet/2012/Booklet_52.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) the seven working and marginalised castes and communities of the village. The scrolls set out the adventures and exploits of local folk heroes who performed on the fringes of the epics, Puranas, etc. of the Hindu 'Greater Tradition'. Each community had its peculiarities and its favourite heroes and heroines as also selection of stories from local Mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;http://jigyasa0.tripod.com/folk.html Jagdish and Kamla Mittal Museum of Indian Art&lt;/ref&gt; It was also customary to sacrifice a goat after the recitation of the story from the scroll in some communities.

==Present times==
At present, Cheriyal painting work is continuing  by
the families of D. Vaikuntam, D.Nageshar, D.Venkataramana,
D.Pavan Kumar.
Dhanalokota Vaikuntam started learning work
from his father Venkataramiah and elder brother Chandraiah at
the age of 12. He studied intermediate and at present he is
living at Hyderabad. He got married with vanaja at the age of
20. After the marriage with Vaikuntam, vanaja also started
doing Cherial painting. He trained to his children Sarika,
Rakesh and Vinay Kumar. He received many awards and
certificates for his excellency in Cherial painting.

Today the long stories from the local mythologies have been cut short, as the traditional patrons for the long scrolls no longer exist. The artists have been forced to adapt and nowadays they paint smaller versions of the scrolls, depicting a single episode or character from the traditional stories. These are amenable to framing and can be hung on walls in modern homes. Further, the colours are no longer prepared in the traditional manner. While earlier, they used natural white extracted from sea shells, black from lampsoot and yellow from turmeric. However, the traditional art continues to linger and survive and even has been a source of inspiration to contemporary artists like Laxman Aelay&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/2013-10-06/Painting-a-new--narrative-73269&lt;/ref&gt; of Kadirengudam village of Andhra Pradesh.

==The Tradition==
[[File:Cherial 5.jpg|thumbnail|left|Contemporary Cheriyal Dolls]]
The traditional art form became an inseparable part of the profession of the story-telling, balladeer community known as ''Kaki Padagollu''. They displayed the scrolls and accompanied by music and dance went from village to village narrating and singing their ballads based from their rich folklore which was rooted in the [[Puranas]] and Indian Epics, enlivening many a lazy village evening.

In a typical recitation, the storyteller-balladeer would  wander from village to village in a team of usually five people, with two to narrate the story while the others would provide a simple but hectic musical accompaniment with the harmonium, tabala and castanets. The stage would also be a simple affair (many times even to the extent of being a rough and ready fixture), erected on four poles with a horizontal bar on which the scrolls could be displayed.
 
[[File:Cheriyal painting - toddy tappers.jpg|thumb|A traditional Cheriyal scroll painting depicting the legends of the toddy tapper community. Circa 18th - 19th century.]]

The scroll would flow like a film roll. It was generally about 
three feet in width and went up to 40 – 45 feet in length, depending upon the story. The traditional scrolls are normally in vertical format, illustrating stories in a series of horizontal panels. A floral border in the middle separates the two panels, while the linear narrative is demonstrated by holding in both hands or suspending it from a tree or a building and continually rolling it. Like large sized comic strips, each panel of the scroll depicted one part of the story. Hence, a scroll would easily have around 50 panels. As the bard would narrate the story, the panel depicting that particular part of the story would be displayed. The choice of episodes and iconography of each deity was painted, keeping in mind the caste for which the scroll was made.

[[File:Cherial 3.jpg|thumbnail|left|A modern Cheriyal painting in making]]

By virtue of its distinct traditional style and characteristics [[Cheriyal]] Paintings were recently given a Geographical Indications (GI) tag. There are very few artists remaining who continue to paint using this unique technique. A recent innovation has been the painting of single pictures (as opposed to a continuous scroll) meant for wall decorations.

== Process ==
The making of the canvas is a very elaborate procedure. The [[Khadi]] cotton is treated with a mixture of starch (from rice), suddha matti (white mud), a paste of boiled tamarind seeds and gum water thrice. It has to be ensured that every coating is thoroughly dried before the next one is applied.
Once the canvas is ready, the artists sketch the outline directly onto the canvas using a brush. The outlines are very well defined and sharply reflecting the quality and experience of the craftsman.
The colors are made by the artists from natural sources. Brushes are made with hair of squirrels tied to a stick.
Dolls and masks are made of wood, saw dust and tamarind paste. Masks are made even with coconut shells.

[[File:Cherial 4.jpg|thumbnail|Contemporary Cheriyal Dolls]]

== Characteristics ==
Cheriyal Paintings can be easily recognised by the following peculiarities and unique characteristics:

• Painted in vivid hues, mostly primary colors, with a predominance of red in the background, the paintings are characterised by the unbridled imagination of the local artisans who were not constrained by the academic rigour that characterised the more classical [[Tanjore painting]] and [[Mysore painting]]. For example, the artist hardly bothers about perspective in Cheriyal paintings and sets out the narrative by placing the relevant figures in appropriate order and position in the relevant background. The iconography of even the major deities like Shiva, Vishnu, etc. has a strong local idiom.

•The subjects of these scroll paintings are easy to relate to – as the themes and stories are familiar – drawn from ancient literary, mythological and folk traditions. The common themes are from the Krishna Leela, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Shiva Puranam, Markandeya Puranam interspersed with the ballads and folk-stories of communities like Gauda, Madiga and so on.

• The main narrative is spiced up with scenes from simple rural life - Women doing chores in the kitchen, men working in the paddy fields or boozing away in merry abandon, festival scenes, etc. are endearingly depicted.

• The costumes and settings in which the figures are depicted are typical and  reflect the culture of Andhra, where these paintings originated.

• Within the narrow panels, proportion is created by depicting trees, or a building, a pillar with drawn curtains, etc. However more often than not, the proportion of individual characters is determined by their relative importance in that particular scene, with the most important character being the largest and most detailed and the lesser characters being smaller and less detailed.

==GI rights==
Cheriyal scroll painting received  Intellectual Property Rights Protection or [[Geographical Indication]] (GI) status in 2007.

The '''Colombian Institute of Culture''' ({{lang-es|Instituto Colombiano de Cultura}}; short name ''Colcultura'') (1968–1997), was established by the [[Colombia]]n government in 1968 to manage official activity in the cultural arena 
and to serve as a cultural intermediary between the government and the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |date=1969-06-28 |title=DECRETO NÚMERO 994 DE 1968 (10 de junio) por el cuál se adoptan los estatutos del Instituto Colombiano de Cultura |url=http://www.mineducacion.gov.co/1759/articles-104137_archivo_pdf.pdf |work=Ministerio de Educación |location=[[Bogotá|Bogotá, Colombia]] |access-date=2016-09-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160930175217/http://www.mineducacion.gov.co/1759/articles-104137_archivo_pdf.pdf |archivedate=2016-09-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Institute was a division of the [[Ministry of National Education (Colombia) |National Ministry of Education]], charged with preserving, promoting, and encouraging Colombian popular, archeological, historical, and artistic culture. Main focus was to stimulate scientific research, reading by the public, and the spread of books, public libraries, cultural centers, and museums. It assisted the country's regional governments in setting up their own cultural programs. The [[Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History]] (ICANH) was part of the Colombian Institute of Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://icanh.gov.co/?idcategoria=1169 ICANH part of Colombian Institute of Culture]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the national government created the [[Ministry of Culture (Colombia)|Ministry of Culture]], replacing the Institute. As a Ministry, the new organization could be larger and more powerful, covering other aspects of culture as well, such as ethnic groups, youth, and film production.

The '''Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage''' is a [[UNESCO]] [[multilateral treaty|treaty]] adopted by the UNESCO General Conference on 17 October 2003. The convention entered into force in 2006, after thirtieth instruments of ratification by UNESCO Member States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2018, 178 states have ratified, approved or accepted the convention.&lt;ref name = ratifications&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=17116&amp;language=E States Parties to the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

===Layout of the Convention===
The Convention contains following provisions:

I. General Provisions

II.  Organs of the Convention

III.  Safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage at the national level

IV. Safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage at the international level

V.  International cooperation and assistance

VI.  Intangible Cultural Heritage Fund

VII.  Reports

VIII.  Transitional clause

IX.  Final clauses

===Purposes of the Convention===

Unlike other UNESCO conventions, this convention begins with stating its purposes, which are;
{{quote|(a)	to safeguard the intangible cultural heritage;
(b)	to ensure respect for the intangible cultural heritage of the communities, groups and individuals concerned;

(c)	to raise awareness at the local, national and international levels of the importance of the intangible cultural heritage, and of ensuring mutual appreciation thereof;
(d)	to provide for international cooperation and assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Definition===
{{Main|Intangible cultural heritage}}

Intangible cultural heritage refers to "traditions or living expressions inherited from our ancestors and passed on to our descendants, such as oral traditions, performing arts, social practices, rituals, festive events, knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe or the knowledge and skills to produce traditional crafts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/01851-EN.pdf What is Intangible Cultural Heritage] p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention defines it as follows:

{{quote|Intangible Cultural Heritage means the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, and skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artifacts and cultural spaces associated therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity. For the purposes of this Convention, consideration will be given solely to such intangible cultural heritage as is compatible with existing international human rights instruments, as well as with the requirements of mutual respect among communities, groups and individuals, and of sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 2
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Function===
The Convention works on both national and international levels.
At the national level, State Parties are supposed to ‘take necessary measures to ensure the safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage present in its territory.” These measures include identification of the intangible cultural heritage that exists in its territory, adoption of appropriate policies, promotion of education and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 11&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, in taking these measures, each state parties must “endeavor to ensure the widest possible participation of communities, groups, and, where appropriate, individuals that create, maintain and transmit such heritage, and to involve them actively in its management”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 15&lt;/ref&gt;

At the international level, this Convention promotes international cooperation, which includes “the exchange of information and experience, joint initiatives, and the establishment of a mechanism of assistance” to other State Parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 19&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lists'''

The Committee to the Convention publishes and keeps up to date two lists of intangible cultural heritage, which are
*the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]]
*the [[List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 16,17&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intangible Cultural Heritage Fund'''

The Convention establishes Intangible Cultural Heritage Fund, the use of which is decided by the Committee. The fund mainly consists of the contributions by State Parties and funds by the General Conference of UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Precursors===
One of the first international occasions that mentioned the preservation of 'intangible heritage' was the World Conference on Cultural Policies in Mexico City in 1982.&lt;ref name="Working towards the 2003 Convention"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/01854-EN.pdf Working towards the 2003 Convention] p.6&lt;/ref&gt; This Conference defined cultural heritage as including “both tangible and intangible works through which the creativity of people finds expression,” and asked UNESCO and Member States to take measures for protecting this kind of heritage.&lt;ref name="Working towards the 2003 Convention"/&gt;

In 1989, UNESCO adopted the Recommendation on the Safeguarding of Traditional Culture and Folklore as the first legal instrument towards the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/01854-EN.pdf Working towards the 2003 Convention] p.7&lt;/ref&gt; This Recommendation reflected the ideas of the earlier Conference in Mexico City. UNESCO conducted some promotional programs for raising awareness of this Recommendation, but was not very successful.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt; However, in the late 90's, there was a conference held for the assessment of this Recommendation, which pointed out some problems to be considered in drafting the Convention. In this sense, this Recommendation served as an important step.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/01854-EN.pdf Working towards the 2003 Convention] p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, UNESCO launched the program of Proclamation of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity, intending to raise awareness of the importance of intangible heritage. This program proclaimed a total of 90 masterpieces between 2001 and 2005, and caused the movement toward the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00103 Proclamation of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity (2001–2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation===

According to the request of Member States, a preliminary study, undertaken by Director-General, on how could the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage be conducted, recommended to create a new document that set an international standard.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 2001, the General Conference adopted another instrument, [[Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity]], which also includes articles dealing with the preservation of ’heritage in all forms’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13179&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity] Article 7&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration and its Action Plan presented basic idea of the coming convention and helped to develop it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/01854-EN.pdf Working towards the 2003 Convention]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of many meetings for two years, the draft Convention was brought into the General Conference and adopted in 2003.

==Criticism==
*The definition of intangible cultural heritage has been criticized as potentially incomplete. For example, in a 2004 article in ''[[Museum International]]'', [[Richard Kurin]] says that because the Convention does not recognize cultural activities not compatible with international human rights instruments, some activities, such as [[female genital mutilation]], that groups may themselves consider critical to their culture, are not eligible. Similarly, Kurin notes that since many group's culture is defined in opposition to other cultures, the requirement for "mutual respect" may leave out traditional songs and stories that glorify "empire, victorious kings, religious conversion, or alternatively resistance to perceived injustice, martyrdom and defeat".&lt;ref name=Kurin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kurin|first=Richard|title=Safeguarding Intangible Cultural Heritage in the 2003 UNESCO Convention: a critical appraisal|journal=Museum International|date=1 May 2004|volume=56|issue=1–2|pages=66–77|doi=10.1111/j.1350-0775.2004.00459.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1350-0775.2004.00459.x/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kurin also notes that the definition can be more expansive than intended by its designers, who originally planned only to protect "traditional cultural activities". He says that it is robust enough to encompass more modern forms of culture, including things like "[[rap music]], [[Australian cricket]], modern dance, post-modernist architectural knowledge, and [[karaoke bars]]".&lt;ref name=Kurin/&gt;
*Richard Kurin has argued that dividing culture into individual units is inconsistent with modern academic views of cultures.&lt;ref name=Kurin/&gt; Additionally, Michael Brown has argued that Convention's focus on cataloging is based on an outdated belief that listing the details of a culture has some connection to preservation of that culture.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Michael F.|title=Heritage Trouble: Recent Work on the Protection of Intangible Cultural Property|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2005|volume=12|issue=01|doi=10.1017/S0940739105050010|url=http://lanfiles.williams.edu/~mbrown/Brown,%20Heritage%20Trouble,%20IJCP,%202005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; States are also encouraged to enact programs to safeguard intangible cultural heritages, though any such work must be done in cooperation with the local practitioners. This aspect has also been criticized, since it is unclear how a state can safeguard a cultural practice by force, particularly if there is insufficient interest from local practitioners.&lt;ref name =Kurin/&gt;

[[File:Georgia crackers 1873.jpg|thumb|right|250px|"A pair of [[Georgia crackers]]" as depicted by illustrator [[James Wells Champney]] in the memoir ''The Great South'' by [[Edward King (author)|Edward King]], 1873]]

'''Cracker''', sometimes '''white cracker''' or "'''''cracka'''''", is a colloquial term for [[white people]], &lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cracker |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cracker |website=Merriam Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; used especially for [[Poor Whites|poor rural whites]] in the [[Southern United States]]. It is also at times used indiscriminately and pejoratively against any person of white background. However, it is sometimes used in a neutral or positive context or self-descriptively with [[pride]] in reference to a native of [[Florida]] or [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (see [[Florida cracker]] and [[Georgia cracker]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Ste. Claire |first= Dana |title= Cracker: Cracker Culture in Florida History |publisher= University Press of Florida |year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
A 1783 pejorative use of "crackers" specifies men who "are descended from convicts that were transported from Great Britain to Virginia at different times, and inherit so much profligacy from they ancestors, that they are the most abandoned set of men on earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F-GFUyty3SAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=nell+painter+white+people#v=onepage&amp;q=crackers&amp;f=false|title=The History of White People|last=Painter|first=Nell Irvin|date=2011-04-18|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=9780393079494|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Franklin]], in his memoirs (1790), referred to "a race of runnagates and crackers, equally wild and savage as the Indians" who inhabit the "desert[ed] woods and mountains".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qp9WAAAAcAAJ|title=Memoirs of Dr Benjamin Franklin: with a review of his pamphlet, entitled "Information to those who would wish to remove to America."|last=Franklin|first=Benjamin|date=1790-01-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term  could have also derived from the [[Middle English]] ''cnac'', ''craic'', or ''crak'', which originally meant the sound of a cracking whip but came to refer to "loud conversation, bragging talk".&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Dolan|Dolan, T. P.]] (2006). ''A Dictionary of Hiberno-English''. Gill &amp; MacMillan. p. 64. {{ISBN|978-0-7171-4039-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Elizabethan]] times this could refer to "entertaining [[conversation]]" (one may be said to "crack" a [[joke]]) and ''cracker'' could be used to describe loud [[braggart]]s; this term and the Gaelic spelling [[craic]] are still in use in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern England]]. It is documented in [[Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]'' (1595): "What cracker is this same that deafs our ears with this abundance of superfluous breath?"&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book

{{quote|I should explain to your Lordship what is meant by Crackers; a name they have got from being great boasters; they are a lawless set of rascalls on the frontiers of Virginia, Maryland, the Carolinas, and Georgia, who often change their places of abode.&lt;ref name="18thcentury"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?path=/Folklife/CustomsandLocalTraditions&amp;id=h-552 | work = Georgia Encyclopedia | title= Cracker |author=Burrison, John A.| year= 2002|accessdate = 2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The compound ''corn-cracker'' was used of poor white farmers (by 1808), especially of Georgians, but also extended to residents of northern Florida, from the cracked kernels of [[corn]] which formed the [[staple food]] of this class of people.
This possibility is cited in the [[EB 1911|1911 edition]] of ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle = Cracker|volume=7 |page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' ("cracker", definition 4) says a derivation of the 18th-century simplex ''cracker'' from the 19th-century compound ''corn-cracker'' is doubtful.

It has been suggested that white slave foremen in the antebellum South were called "crackers" owing to their practice of "cracking the whip" to drive and punish slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Smitherman|first=Dr. Geneva|title=Black Talk: Words and Phrases from the Hood to the Amen Corner|year=2000|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Books}}, 100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Herbst|first=Philip H|title=The Color of Words: An Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Ethnic Bias in the United States|year=1997|publisher=Intercultural Press}}, 6z1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Juba to Jive: A Dictionary of African-American Slang|last=Major|first=Clarence|publisher=Puffin Books|year=1994|isbn=978-0-14-051306-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whips were also cracked over pack animals, so "cracker" may have referred to whip cracking more generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= Buckingham | first = James S | title = The slave states of America |publisher= Fisher, Son, &amp; Co. |year = 1842}}, 210.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thornton"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Thornton | first = Richard H |title= An American Glossary |publisher= JB Lippincott |year = 1912}}, 218-219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fcit.usf.edu/florida/lessons/cowboys/cowboys.htm Cattle and Cowboys in Florida] Florida Center for Instructional Technology College of Education, University of South Florida, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

===Meliorative and neutral usage===
{{further|Georgia cracker|Florida cracker|Culture of the Southern United States|Redneck}}

"Cracker" has also been used as a proud or jocular self-description. With the huge influx of new residents from the North, "cracker" is used informally by some white residents of [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] ("[[Florida cracker]]" or "Georgia cracker") to indicate that their family has lived there for many generations. However, the term "white cracker" is seldom used self-referentially and remains a "slur" for Caucasians.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

[[Frederick Law Olmsted]], a prominent [[landscape architect]] from [[Connecticut]], visited the South as a [[journalist]] in the 1850s and wrote that "some crackers owned a good many Negroes, and were by no means so poor as their appearance indicated."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/nc/olmsted/olmsted.html#p413|last= Olmsted |first= Frederick Law |title= Our Slave States |publisher= Dix &amp; Edwards |year= 1856 |page= 454 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] quotes a Professor Wyman as saying, "one of the 'crackers' (i.e. Virginia squatters) added, 'we select the black members of a litter [of pigs] for raising, as they alone have a good chance of living."

In 1947, the student body of [[Florida State University]] voted on the name of their athletic symbol. From a list of more than 100 choices, [[FSU Seminoles|Seminoles]] was selected. The other finalists, in order of finish, were ''Statesmen'', ''Rebels'', ''[[Tarpon]]s'', ''Fighting Warriors'', and ''Crackers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nolefan.org/summary/seminoles.html |title=FSU Adopts Seminoles as the Nickname for Athletic Teams |publisher=Nolefan.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garnetandgreat.com/ |title=www.garnetandgreat.com |publisher=www.garnetandgreat.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[Milwaukee Braves (1953–69)|Milwaukee Braves]] [[baseball]] team moved to [[Atlanta]], the Atlanta [[minor league baseball]] team was known as the "[[Atlanta Crackers]]". The team existed under this name from 1901 until 1965. They were members of the [[Southern Association]] from their inception until 1961, and members of the [[International League]] from 1961 until they were moved to [[Richmond, Virginia]] in 1965. However, it is suggested {{Who|date=September 2014}} the name was derived from players "cracking" the baseball bat and this origin makes sense when considering the Atlanta [[Negro League Baseball]] team was known as the "[[Atlanta Black Crackers]]".

Singer-songwriter [[Randy Newman]], on his socio-politically themed album ''[[Good Old Boys (Randy Newman album)|Good Old Boys]]'' ([[1974 in music|1974]]) uses the term "cracker" on the song "Kingfish" ("I'm a cracker, You one too, Gonna take good care of you"). The song's subject is [[Huey Long]], populist Governor and then Senator for Louisiana (1928–1935). The term is also used in "[[Louisiana 1927]]" from the same album, where the line "Ain't it a shame what the river has done to this poor cracker's land" is attributed to [[Calvin Coolidge|President Coolidge]].

[[United States Presidential election, 2008|In 2008]], former President [[Bill Clinton]] used the term "cracker" on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' to describe white voters he was attempting to win over for [[Barack Obama]]: "You know, they think that because of who I am and where my politic[al] base has traditionally been, they may want me to go sort of hustle up what [[Lawton Chiles]] used to call the 'cracker vote' there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Ben |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/Bill_Clinton_Will_respect_Jewish_holidays_then_hustle_up__cracker_vote_in_Florida.html |title=Bill Clinton: Will respect Jewish holidays, then 'hustle up ... cracker vote' in Florida – Ben Smith |publisher=[[Politico]] |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crackin' Good Snacks (a division of [[Winn-Dixie (supermarket)|Winn-Dixie]], a Southern grocery chain) has sold crackers similar to [[Ritz cracker]]s under the name "Georgia Crackers". They sometimes were packaged in a red tin with a picture of The Crescent, an [[Antebellum architecture|antebellum]] [[Plantation complexes in the Southeastern United States#Plantation house|plantation house]] in [[Valdosta, Georgia]].

The [[Florida Cracker Trail]] is a route which cuts across southern [[Florida]], following the historic trail of the old cattle drives.

On June 27, 2013, in the [[trial of George Zimmerman]], a [[Hispanic]], concerning the [[shooting of Trayvon Martin]], a witness under examination ([[Rachel Jeantel]]) testified that Martin said (on the phone) to her that a "creepy ass cracker is following me" minutes before the altercation between Martin and Zimmerman occurred. Zimmerman's attorney then asked her if "creepy ass cracker" was an offensive term, to which she responded "no". That testimony and response brought about both media and public debate about the use of the word "cracker". A [[CNN]] report referenced the regional nature of the term, noting both that "some in Florida use the term in a non-derogatory, colloquial sense" and that it is sometimes regarded as a "sharp racial insult that resonates with white southerners even if white northerners don't get it".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/01/us/zimmerman-trial-cracker/ Foreman, Tom. "'Cracker' conveys history of bigotry that still resonates]", ''[[CNN]]'', 2 July 2013, accessed 30 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pejorative usage===
In his 1964 speech "[[The Ballot or the Bullet]]", [[Malcolm X]] used the term "cracker" in reference to white people in a pejorative context.&lt;ref name="mx"&gt;{{cite web|first=Malcolm|last=X|title=The Ballot or the Bullet|url=http://www.edchange.org/multicultural/speeches/malcolm_x_ballot.html|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one passage, he remarked, "It's time for you and me to stop sitting in this country, letting some cracker senators, Northern crackers and Southern crackers, sit there in Washington, D.C., and come to a conclusion in their mind that you and I are supposed to have civil rights. There's no white man going to tell me anything about my rights."&lt;ref name=mx/&gt;

On November 29, 1993, in a speech given at Kean College in New Jersey, [[Nation of Islam]] spokesman Khallid Abdul Muhammad called [[Pope John Paul II]] "a no good cracker".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/05/nyregion/farrakhan-invited-to-speak-at-school.html | work=The New York Times | title=Farrakhan Invited To Speak at School | date=1994-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Michael Dunn shot and killed [[Shooting of Jordan Davis|Jordan Davis]] in an argument over loud music coming from a car. Dunn claimed he had heard "something something cracker" and "I should fucking kill that mother fucker".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/02/did_white_male_insecurity_kill_jordan_davis.html?wpisrc=burger |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222001054/http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/02/did_white_male_insecurity_kill_jordan_davis.html?wpisrc=burger |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://ideas.time.com/2014/02/17/michael-dunn-jordan-davis-trial/ | work=Time | first=John | last=McWhorter | title=How Not to Lose Another Jordan Davis | date=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/hung-jury-for-michael-dunn-white-killer-of-unarmed-black-teenager-jordan-davis-9132238.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Tim | last=Walker | title=Hung jury for Michael Dunn, white killer of unarmed black teenager Jordan Davis | date=2014-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/accused-loud-music-shooter-michael-dunn-it-was-life-or-death/ | work=CBS News | title=Accused "Loud Music" Shooter Dunn: "It was life or death"|date=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="868">'''Days of the Croatian Language''' ({{lang-hr|Dani hrvatskoga jezika}}) is an annual week-long cultural event established by [[Matica hrvatska]] which celebrates the [[Croatian language]]. It is held from March 11 to March 17. 

It was first held upon [[Croatia]]n independence in 1991. In 1997 the [[Croatian Parliament]] declared that this week would officially commemorate the [[Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Standard Language]] published exactly thirty years earlier. 

The week is marked by cultural and literary events across Croatia, as well as among the [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3779">The '''dimachaeri''' (singular: '''dimachaerus''') were a type of Roman [[gladiator]] that fought with two [[sword]]s. The name is the Latin-language borrowing of the Greek word {{lang|grc|διμάχαιρος}} meaning "bearing two knives" ([[Wiktionary:di-|di-]] ''dual'' + [[Wiktionary:μαχαίρι|machairi]] ''knife''). 

The dimachaeri were popular during the 2nd-4th centuries AD, and were probably considered to be "insidious" by many Romans.&lt;ref name=nossov&gt;{{cite book|last=Nossov|first=Konstantin|title=Gladiator: Rome's bloody spectacle|year=2009|publisher=Osprey|isbn=1-84603-472-8|pages=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both written and pictorial records on dimachaeri are scant and rather indeterminate.&lt;ref&gt;The Power of Spectacle in Ancient Rome: Gladiators and Caesars, ed. by Eckart Köhne and Cornelia Ewigleben (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 2000), p. 63. {{ISBN|978-0-520-22798-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, an inscription from Lyon, France, mentions such a type of gladiator, here spelled ''dymacherus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|13|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Equipment==
Depictions of dimachaeri and their equipment vary in pictorial sources, so it is difficult to say exactly how, and how uniformly, they were equipped. Some pictorial sources depict dimachaeri wearing extremely minimal armour such as a [[Baldric#Roman balteus|balteus]] and leather wrappings or none at all, save a ''subligaculum'' (loin cloth). Other show a slightly more heavily armored dimachaerus, variously equipped with [[scale armor]], [[chain mail|mail]] shirts, [[Combat helmet|visored helmets]] in the fashion of [[murmillo]]s, [[greave]]s and leg wrappings, both barefoot and in sandals. It is a mistake to suppose that dimachaeri were always identically equipped, or even similarly equipped, apart from wielding two blades. It is also entirely possible that the dimachaerus was not a separate class of gladiator at all, but a sub-discipline within a class, or even a cross-discipline practiced by multiple classes. In the late Roman Empire, when references to dimachaeri first appear, many novelties and new gladiator types were being introduced to the arena,&lt;ref&gt;'The private life of the Romans' Harold Whetstone Johnston (1905) p 259&lt;/ref&gt; and sub-classes had appeared within many gladiator types.

==Fighting style==
The dimachaeri were equipped for close-combat fighting.&lt;ref name=nossov /&gt; A dimachaerus used a pair of [[Sica|siccae]] (curved scimitar) or [[gladius]] and used a fighting style adapted to both attack and defend with his weapons rather than a shield, as he was not equipped with one.&lt;ref name=nossov /&gt;&lt;ref name="Junkelmann63"&gt;Marcus Junkelmann, 'Familia Gladiatoria: "The Heroes of the Amphitheatre"' in The Power of Spectacle in Ancient Rome: Gladiators and Caesars, ed. by Eckart Köhne and Cornelia Ewigleben (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 2000), p. 63. {{ISBN|978-0-520-22798-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little else is known about this class of gladiator, but due to the difficulty of wielding two swords it can be inferred that dimachaeri were highly skilled and experienced fighters, and were probably relatively exalted as a class of gladiator.&lt;ref name="Junkelmann63" /&gt; Dimachaeri would have been ideally suited to fight heavily armored opponents and they may have fought other dimachaeri, as well.&lt;ref name=nossov /&gt; They are known to have been paired against the [[hoplomachus]] and are also referred to as fighting against a gladiator class called an [[oplomachus]],&lt;ref&gt;4. P.J. Meier 'De gladiatura Romana' (1881) p.p. 22 - 25&lt;/ref&gt; which, according to [[Justus Lipsius]], was a putative variant of the [[Samnite (gladiator type)|Samnite]].&lt;ref&gt;Roman life and manners under the early empire 'Ludwig Friedlaender' (1913)pp 176-2&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15506">[[File:Dol.jpg|thumb|''[[Doljanchi|Dol]]'' is the traditional way of celebrating a birthday of a one-year-old child in South Korea]]
'''East Asian age reckoning''' is a concept and practice that originated in [[China]] and continues in limited use there and in Japan, but is still common in Korea. People are born at the age of one (instead of "zero"), and on [[Chinese New Year]] or [[New Year's Day]] one year is added to their age.&lt;ref name=why&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.culturalink.gov.cn/chineseway/2009-04/30/content_327732.htm | title=Why Chinese People Have a Nominal Age | publisher=ChinaCulture.org | author=Shi Liwei | accessdate=11 November 2009 | date=30 April 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005081651/http://www.culturalink.gov.cn/chineseway/2009-04/30/content_327732.htm | archivedate=5 October 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Star"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/10/25/nation/19269368 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604024043/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F10%2F25%2Fnation%2F19269368 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = June 4, 2011 | work = [[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] | title = 98, 90 or 93?

==Variations in date for change of age==
Under the traditional reckoning in China, age changes on the [[lichun]].  In Japan and South Korea, [[New Year's Day]] is used as the date of change of age for the traditional system.

==China==
In either the traditional or modern age system the word ''sui'' ({{zh| s=岁 | t=歲 | p=suì | first=t}}), meaning "years of age", is used for age counting. When a person's age is given in a publication, it is often specified whether it is his or her:
*''Traditional'' age, "virtual age" ({{zh| s=虚岁/龄 | t=虛歲/齡 | p=xūsuì/líng | links=no | first=t}}) based on the East Asian reckoning system
*''Modern'' age, "round age"  ({{zh| s=周岁 | t=周歲 | p=zhōusùi | links=no | first=t}})
*"Real age", ({{zh| s=实岁 | t=實歲 | p=shísùi | links=no | first=t}}) based on the [[Gregorian calendar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.china.com.cn/book/txt/2009-03/31/content_17526872.htm | title=中国人为何还有一个虚岁 | accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Of the three, only 周歲/周岁 (Chinese), ''zhōusuì'' (pinyin) = "round age" may be used as a count word.

When a child has survived one month of life (29 days if lunar month reckoning) a ''mun yuet'' ({{zh| t=滿月 | p=mǎnyuè | links=no | first=t}}) celebration can be observed, in which duck or chicken eggs dyed red are distributed to guests to signify fertility.

==Japan==
The traditional Japanese system of age reckoning, or ''kazoedoshi'' ({{lang|ja|数え年}}, lit. "counted years"), which incremented one's age on [[New Year's Day]], was rendered obsolete by law in 1902 when Japan officially adopted the modern age system,&lt;ref&gt;[http://crd.ndl.go.jp/GENERAL/servlet/detail.reference?id=1000058502 レファレンス事例詳細: 相-090002], Collaborative Reference Database. (Accessed 2009-11-11.) "なお、年齢が数えか満年齢かについては、現行法規である「年齢計算ニ関スル法律」が明治35年12月2日法律第50号として存在するが、その前に「明治六年第三十六号布告」で満年齢について規定された。 (translation: Regarding whether one counts age by ``kazoedoshi`` or the modern age system (満年齢), there exists the current "Legal age calculation" law in the form of Meiji 35 (1902), December 2, Act no. 50, but prior to that the use of the modern age system was set forth in the "Meiji 13 Proclamation No. 6".)"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.e-gov.go.jp/htmldata/M35/M35HO050.html|title=年齢計算ニ関スル法律 ''Act on Calculation of Ages'' |publisher=Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications Japan |year=1902| language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Act on Calculation of Ages|publisher= Ministry of Justice, Japan|url=http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail/?id=199&amp;vm=04&amp;re=01|year=1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; known in Japanese as ''man nenrei'' ({{lang|ja|満年齢}}). However, the traditional system was still commonly used, so in 1950 another law was established to encourage people to use the modern age system.&lt;ref&gt;Hirofumi Hirano, July Heisei 40, [http://www.shugiin.go.jp/itdb_shitsumon.nsf/html/shitsumon/a154154.htm 年齢の計算に関する質問主意書 (Memorandum on questions about the calculation of age)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628210713/http://www.shugiin.go.jp/itdb_shitsumon.nsf/html/shitsumon/a154154.htm |date=2009-06-28 }}, Japan House of Representatives.

Today the traditional system is used only by the elderly and in rural areas. Elsewhere its use is limited to traditional ceremonies, divinations, and obituaries.{{Or|date=November 2009}}

Japanese uses the word ''sai'' ({{lang|ja|歳}} or {{lang|ja|才}}) as a [[Japanese counter word|counter word]] for both the traditional and modern age system.

==Korea==
{{See also|Korean birthday celebrations}}
[[Korea]]ns who use the traditional system refer to their age in units called ''sal'' ([[wikt:살|살]]), using [[Korean numerals]] in [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal]] form. Thus, a person is one ''sal'' ("han sal", 한살) during the first [[Korean calendar|calendar]] year of life, and ten ''sal'' during the tenth calendar year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Song, Jae Jung|Song, Jae Jung. (2005)]], pp. 81–82, (quote) "Koreans prefer native Korean to Sino-Korean numerals when telling their own or other people's age,...Note that the native age classifier ''sal'' must be used with native Korean numerals and the Sino-Korean age classifier ''sey'' with Sino-Korean numerals,.."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pravda"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://english.pravda.ru/society/stories/16-07-2013/125145-korea_children-0/ | work = [[Pravda]] | title = In Korea, all children are older than their European peers | date = July 16, 2013 | accessdate = 2014-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 100th-day anniversary of a baby is called ''baegil'' ({{linktext|백|일}}, {{linktext|百|日}}) which literally means "a hundred days" in Korean, and is given a special celebration, marking the survival of what was once a period of high [[infant mortality]]. The first anniversary of birth named ''[[Doljanchi|dol]]'' ([[wikt:돌|돌]]) is likewise celebrated, and given even greater significance. South Koreans celebrate their birthdays,&lt;ref&gt;[[#DuBois|DuBois (2004)]], pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; even though every South Korean gains one 'sal' on New Year's Day.&lt;ref name="RTI International"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rti.org/pubs/aapor07_park_pres.pdf |title=Cognitive Interviewing with Asian Populations: Findings from Chinese and Korean Interviews |publisher=RTI International |author=Park, Hyunjoo|author2=Pan, Yuling|date=2007-05-19|accessdate=2009-11-11|location=[[Anaheim]], CA |quote=Koreans are considered one year old at birth and added another year at New Year’s....some Koreans may use American age counting convention while others still follow Korean convention. To eliminate this confusion, Korean asked “만나이(Man-nai)’: the same as the U.S. age counting convention.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the first year comes at birth and the second on the first day of the New Year, children born, for example, on December 29 will reach two years of age on the [[New Year's Day]], when they are only days old. Hence, everyone born on the same calendar year effectively has the same age and can easily be calculated by the formula: Age = (Current Year &amp;minus; Birth Year) + 1

In modern South Korea the traditional system is used alongside the international age system which is referred to as ''"man-nai"'' (만나이) in which ''"man"'' ([[wikt:만|만]]) means "full"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kordic.nate.com/dicsearch/view.html?i=12628300 |script-title=ko:만7(滿) |publisher=[[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] Korean Dictionary |language=Korean |accessdate=2009-11-11 |quote=시기나 햇수를 꽉 차게 헤아림을 이르는 말.(trans.

When you're born, you're already one year old, and then you get another year older when New Year's Day rolls around. The result is that your hangungnai (한국나이), 'Korean age', is usually one to two years older than your man-nai (만 나이), 'actual age'. Under-age kids sometimes try to take some advantage of this, but eligibility for drinking, obtaining license etc is determined by your actual age."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''man yeol sal'' means "full ten years", or "ten years old" in English. The Korean word ''dol'' means "years elapsed", identical to the English "years old", but is only used to refer to the first few birthdays. ''Cheotdol'' or simply ''dol'' refers to the first Western-equivalent birthday, ''dudol'' refers to the second, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://engdic.nate.com/dicsearch/view.html?i=162364 |script-title=ko:돌 |trans-title=Dol |publisher=[[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] Korean–English Dictionary |accessdate=2009-11-11 |language=Korean |quote=) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714155634/http://engdic.nate.com/dicsearch/view.html?i=162364 |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kordic.nate.com/dicsearch/view.html?i=10059200 |script-title=ko:돌1 |trans-title=Dol |publisher=[[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] Korean Dictionary |accessdate=2009-11-11 |language=Korean |quote=Ⅰ.

The traditional system has not been used in modern [[North Korea]] since the 1980s.

The Korean Birthday Celebrations by the lunar calendar is called ''eumnyeok saeng-il'' (음력 생일, 陰曆生日) and ''yangnyeok saeng-il'' (양력 생일, 陽曆生日) is the birthday by Gregorian calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.chosun.com/news/news.htm?name=/news/sports/200608/20060809/68i70061.htm |title='8월 18일은 이승엽 DAY!'...요미우리, 축하 이벤트 마련 |trans-title='The day on August 18 is Lee Seung-Yeop's Day!'..Yomiuri, preparing a congratulatory event |publisher=[[Sports Chosun]] |author=Kim Tae-yeop (김태엽) |date=2006-08-08 |accessdate=2009-11-11 |language=Korean |quote=최근 이승엽의 아버지 이춘광씨는 보통 '''양력생일'''을 치르는 요즘의 추세와 달리 이승엽의 '''음력 생일'''(1976년 8월18일)을 치르는 사연을 밝혀 화제가 됐다 (trans.

[[File:Modern Asia (1796).tif|thumb|upright=1.3|The Eastern world in a 1796 map, which included the continents of Asia and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] (then known as [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]).]]
The term '''Eastern world''' refers to various [[culture]]s or [[society|social structures]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] systems depending on the context, most often including at least part of [[Asia]] or geographically the countries and cultures east of Europe, the Mediterranean Region and [[Arab world]], specifically in historical ([[pre-modern]]) contexts, and in modern times in the context of [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = |author2=Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson|location = Boston, MA| id = 0-205-41365-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term is usually not used by people in this region itself, since this Eastern world is a varied, complex and dynamic region, hard to generalize, and although these countries and regions have many common threads running through them, historically they never needed to define themselves collectively against another entity, real or superficial.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Sandra S. Mouth, Joanna.  Barbara, Koening A. The Meanings of Race in the New Genomics: Implications for Health Disparities Research. Yale University. 2001. October 26, 2006. [http://www.yale.edu/yjhple/volume_1/pdf/033%20(koenig).pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101012859/http://www.yale.edu/yjhple/volume_1/pdf/033%20%28koenig%29.pdf |date=2006-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term originally had a literal geographic meaning, referring to the eastern part of the [[Old World]], contrasting the cultures and civilizations of Asia with those of Europe (the ''[[Occident]]'' or [[Western world]]). Traditionally, this includes all of [[Central Asia|Central]], [[North Asia|North]] and [[East Asia]] (the [[Far East]]), [[Greater Middle East]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]] (the [[Indian subcontinent]]). 

Conceptually, the boundary between east and west is cultural, rather than geographical, as a result of which [[Australia]] is typically grouped in the 
West, while [[Muslim world|Islamic nations]] and much of the former [[Soviet Union]] are, regardless of location, grouped in the East.&lt;ref name=Mestrovic&gt;{{cite book | last = Meštrovic | first = Stjepan | title = Balkanization of the West: The Confluence of Postmodernism and Postcommunism | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-203-34464-2 | page = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than [[Asia]] and some parts of [[Africa]], [[Europe]] has successfully absorbed almost all of the societies of Oceania, and the [[Americas]] into the [[Western world]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/culture_academic/fine_arts.html |title=Embassy of Brazil - Ottawa |publisher=Brasembottawa.org |accessdate=2011-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429013145/http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/culture_academic/fine_arts.html |archivedate=2011-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Falcoff |first=Mark |url=http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.11413/pub_detail.asp |title=Chile Moves On |publisher=AEI |accessdate=2011-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417075124/http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.11413/pub_detail.asp |archivedate=2009-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turkey]], the [[Philippines]],

== Identity politics ==

=== Asian concepts ===
{{cleanup|reason=The first paragraph in this section uses English words, but does not manage to make coherent English sentences. The second paragraph is mostly one run-on sentence.|date=April 2018}}
[[File:LocationAsia.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|An image of the "Eastern world" defined as [[Asia]]]]
Although the concept of a united Asian people and not mean [[Asian people|Asian race]] is even more debatable due to the fact that most of the world link the identity of Asian only to the people of South, East and Southeast Asia and so regions like [[Western Asia]] that who even though see themselves as part of the Eastern world such as the [[Arab world|Arab nations]] of Western Asia, [[Israel]], [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], and the ethnic groups that come along with these countries do not identify as Asian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Khatib | first = Lina | title = Filming the modern Middle East: politics in the cinemas of Hollywood and the Arab world | volume = 57 | series = Library of Modern Middle East Studies, Library of International Relations | publisher = [[I.B. Tauris]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-84511-191-5 | pages = 166–167, 173}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another reason why a [[Pan-Asianism|Pan-Asian]] identity is a flawed work in progress concept compared to the mass unity found in the continents of Europe and Africa is the fact that Asia is the most racially and ethnically diverse continent in the world&lt;ref&gt;Cartmill, M. (1999). The Status of the Race Concept in Physical Anthropology. American Anthropologist 100(3)651 -660.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, "Asian and Indian people" are referred to in the New Zealand Heart Foundation's [http://www.pickthetick.org.nz/bmi/ BMI calculator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531222922/http://www.pickthetick.org.nz/bmi/ |date=2009-05-31 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; that differs very widely among and within its regions with many different cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems whose people have an even further pan-continental belief of [[Nationalism|nationalistic]], cultural, and [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic individualism]] many of whom believe came out of the imperialistic colonization of the continent by foreign Western powers back in [[colonialism|colonial times]] and because of this overt sense individualism across the continent once a specific group(s) is labeled something many groups within Asia will have a hard time identifying with the same label. Most of the people of Asia prefer to identify with their individual nations rather than with their continent, region, or each other and these attitudes can be found throughout the continent.

The division between 'East' and 'West' is a product of European cultural history, and of the distinction between European [[Christendom]] and the cultures beyond it to the East. With the [[European colonization of the Americas]] the East/West distinction became global. The concept of an Eastern, "Indian" ([[Indies]]) or "[[Oriental]]" sphere was emphasized by ideas of racial as well as religious and cultural differences. Such distinctions were articulated by Westerners in the scholarly tradition known as Orientalism and [[Indology]]. An intriguing fact to be noted is that [[Orientalism]] has been the only Western concept that was about a unified Eastern world and not about any specific region(s), but rather all of Asia together.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;from the Latin ''oriens''; ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European concepts ===
During the [[Cold War]], the term "Eastern world" was sometimes used as an extension of [[Eastern bloc]], connoting the [[Soviet Union]], [[China]] and their [[communist]] allies, while the term "Western world" often connoted the [[United States]] and its [[NATO]] allies such as the [[United Kingdom]].

The concept is often another term for the [[Far East]] – a region that bears considerable cultural and religious commonality. Eastern philosophy, art, literature, and other traditions, are often found throughout the region in places of high importance, such as popular culture, architecture and traditional literature. The spread of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Yoga]] is partly responsible for this.

Eastern culture has developed many themes and traditions. Some important ones are:

* [[Abrahamic religions]] (a.k.a. [[Abrahamic religions|West Asian religions]]) 
** [[Christianity]] — the majority of the modern world adheres to this faith although it isn't widely practiced in its native continent of Asia anymore and since the faith had spread to the [[Western World]] the notion of "Europe" and the "Western World" has been intimately connected with the concept of "[[Christendom|Christianity and Christendom]]" many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified European identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=9780813216836|edition=reprint|author2=Glenn Olsen|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, vibrant indigenous minorities in the [[Levant]] have preserved their ancient beliefs, adhering to [[Syriac Christianity]] (i.e. [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] and [[Maronite people]]), an [[Eastern Christian]] sect.
** [[Islam]] — the majority of the world [[Muslim]] population have always lived in Asia, due to Islam spreading and becoming the dominant religion of these areas.
** [[Judaism]] — the national religion of the [[Israelites]]/[[Hebrews]] of the [[Fertile Crescent]], or what is now [[Israel]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], and [[Lebanon]]. They eventually evolved into the [[Jews]] (particularly [[Ashkenazi]], [[Sephardic]], [[Mizrahi]]) and [[Samaritans]] of today.
* [[Zoroastrianism]] — the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[state religion]] of [[Sassanid Persia|Sassanid Iran]]
* [[Eastern religions]] / [[Eastern philosophy]]
** [[Indian religions]]
*** [[Buddhism]] — the path of liberation attained through insight into the ultimate nature of reality.
*** [[Hinduism]] 
*** [[Jainism]]
*** [[Sikhism]] — a religion that developed in the warring plains of [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in an atmosphere of ideological clash between [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]]. Its followers retain spiritual as well as martial qualities.
** [[East Asian religions|Taoic religions]] (a.k.a. [[East Asian religions]] or [[East Asian religions|Far Eastern religions]])
*** [[Chinese folk religion]]
*** [[Confucianism]] — the belief that human beings are teachable, improvable and perfectible through personal and communal endeavour especially including self-cultivation and self-creation.
*** [[Shinto]]
*** [[Taoism]]

'''Eyak''' is an extinct [[Na-Dené languages|Na-Dené language]] historically spoken by the [[Eyak people]], indigenous to south-central [[Alaska]], near the mouth of the [[Copper River (Alaska)|Copper River]]. The name Eyak comes from a [[Chugach Sugpiaq]] name (''Igya'aq'') for an Eyak village at the mouth of the Eyak River.&lt;ref name="Krausseyakhistory"&gt;Michael E. Krauss 2006.[http://ccil.org/~cowan/temp/43.2.krauss.pdf A history of Eyak language documentation and study: Fredericæ de Laguna in Memoriam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831023534/http://ccil.org/~cowan/temp/43.2.krauss.pdf |date=2013-08-31 }}. ''Arctic Anthropology'' 43 (2): 172-217&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first Alaskan language to go extinct in recent history.

The closest relatives of Eyak are the [[Athabaskan languages]]. The Eyak–Athabaskan group forms a basic division of the Na-Dené language family, the other being [[Tlingit language|Tlingit]].

Numerous Tlingit place names along the Gulf Coast are derived from names in Eyak; they have obscure or even nonsensical meanings in Tlingit, but oral tradition has maintained many Eyak etymologies. The existence of Eyak-derived Tlingit names along most of the coast towards southeast Alaska is strong evidence that the prehistoric range of Eyak was once far greater than it was at the time of European contact. This confirms both Tlingit and Eyak oral histories of migration throughout the region.

[[Marie Smith Jones]] (May 14, 1918&amp;nbsp;– January 21, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120729204845/http://www.adn.com/189/story/290580.html ADN.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7206411.stm | work=BBC News | title=Last Alaska language speaker dies | date=January 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"[http://www.slate.com/id/2182949 How Do You Learn a Dead Language?]", Christine Cyr, ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', January 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]] was the language's last native speaker,&lt;ref&gt;John McWhorter,"No Tears For Dead Tongues"[https://www.forbes.com/2008/02/21/language-death-english-tech-cx_jm_language_sp08_0221death.html], [[Forbes]],2/21/2008 @ 6:00PM.&lt;/ref&gt; and the last full-blooded Eyak. Because of the dying off of its native speakers, Eyak became a symbol in the fight against [[endangered language|language extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/obituary/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10640514 | work=The Economist | title=Marie Smith | date=February 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of [[English language|English]] and suppression of aboriginal languages are not the only reasons for the decline of the Eyak language. The northward migration of the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] people around [[Yakutat, Alaska|Yakutat]] in precontact times encouraged the use of [[Tlingit language|Tlingit]] rather than Eyak along much of the [[Pacific Coast]] of Alaska. Eyak was also under pressure from its neighbors to the west, the [[Alutiiq]] people of [[Prince William Sound]], as well as some pressure from the people of the Copper River valley. Eyak and Tlingit culture began to merge along the Gulf Coast, and a number of Eyak-speaking groups were absorbed by the Gulf Coast Tlingit populations. This resulted in the replacement of Eyak by Tlingit among most of the mixed groups after a few generations, as reported in Tlingit oral histories of the area.

===Revival===
In June 2010, the [[Anchorage Daily News]] published an article about [[Guillaume Leduey]], a French college student with an unexpected connection to the Eyak language. Beginning at age 12, he had taught himself Eyak, utilizing print and audio instructional materials he obtained from the [[Alaska Native Language Center]]. During that time, he never traveled to Alaska or conversed with Marie Smith Jones, the last native speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hopkins|first=Kyle|title=Extinct Alaska Native language interests French student|url=http://www.adn.com/2010/06/27/1343777/unlikely-passion-may-save-eyak.html|accessdate=15 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610140310/http://www.adn.com/2010/06/27/1343777/unlikely-passion-may-save-eyak.html|archivedate=10 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The month that the article was published, he traveled to Alaska and met with Dr. [[Michael E. Krauss|Michael Krauss]], a noted linguist and Professor Emeritus at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Dr. Krauss assisted Leduey with proper Eyak phonological pronunciation and assigned further instruction in grammar and morphology—including morphemic analyses of traditional Eyak stories.

In June 2011, Leduey returned to Alaska to facilitate Eyak language workshops in Anchorage and Cordova. He is now regarded as a fluent speaker, translator, and instructor of Eyak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibbins|first=Jennifer|title=Preserving Alaska Native culture|url=http://www.thecordovatimes.com/article/1125preserving_alaska_native_culture|accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his fluency, Eyak remains classified as "dormant" as there are no native speakers. On the Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (EGIDS) Eyak is graded a 9 (dormant); the language serves as a reminder of heritage identity for an ethnic community, but no one has more than symbolic proficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethnologue |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/eya}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Leduey provides instruction and curriculum assistance to the [http://www.eyakpeople.com/project|Eyak Language Project] from France.

The Eyak Preservation Council received an Alaska Humanities Forum Grant that enabled them to start a website devoted to the preservation of the Eyak Language. Other funding supports the annual Eyak Culture Camp every August in Cordova. The Project provides countless language resources including immersion workshops, an online dictionary with audio samples, and a set of eLearning lessons, among others.

In June 2014, the Eyak Language Revitalization Project announced an online program called "dAXunhyuuga'", which means "the words of the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Language family==
{{main|Na-Dene languages}}
Eyak is a part of the Eyak-Athabaskan language family and [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dené]] larger grouping, which includes Eyak-Athabaskan and [[Tlingit language|Tlingit]] with a controversial but possible inclusion of [[Haida language|Haida]]. The [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan family]] covers three distinct geographic areas, forming three subgroups: [[Northern Athabaskan languages|Northern Athabaskan]] in Alaska and the Yukon; [[Pacific Coast Athabaskan languages|Pacific Coast Athabaskan]] in California and Oregon; and [[Southern Athabaskan languages|Southern Athabaskan]], also called Apache, spoken mainly in the American Southwest, which includes [[Navajo language|Navajo]]. There has been extensive comparative reconstruction of a Proto-Athabaskan-Eyak (PAE). A recent proposal of a [[Dené–Yeniseian languages|Dené–Yeniseian]] stock has been widely well received by linguists, linking the Dené languages to the [[Yeniseian languages]] of central Siberia. If it proves correct, it will be the first validated genetic link between Old and New World languages. Far less accepted is a possible [[Dené–Caucasian languages|Dené–Caucasian]] stock that has been pursued for decades.

==Phonology==
The following charts are based on the material in Krauss (1965); [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] equivalents are shown in square brackets. The orthography used by Krauss and the Eyak people is the same, substituting only '''A''', '''L''', and '''X''' for respective [ə], [ł], and [x̣].

The nasals [n] and [m] occur in loanwords; in native words, Krauss (1965) suggests that they can be interpreted as /l/ and /w/ (respectively) followed by a nasalized vowel. /b/ and /ŋ/ occur only in loanwords. Aspirated stops contrast with unaspirated stops only before vowels.

All consonants may be found stem-initially, except /h/, which is interpreted as zero. /h/ has the allophone [h] only word-initially or directly following a vowel.

===Vowels===

:{|class="wikitable" style=text-align:center
|-

! [[Front vowel|Front]]

|-
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
| '''æ''' {{IPA|[æ]}}

| 
|}

In Krauss's terminology, vowels can be oral or [[Nasal vowel|nasal]], with further modification by [[glottalization]], [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]], [[Vowel length|length]], or a combination of glottalization and length. The only unmodified vowels are /i/, /A/ and /u/. Unmodified /A/ varies [[Morphophonology|morphophonemically]] between [æ] and [e], so /ə/ serves as the basic form of both vowels. When orally modified, the nucleus of /e/ varies between [ɛ] and [æ], the nucleus of /a/ between [a] and [ɔ]. 
All vowels, regardless of their oral modification, are nasalized following /n/, with the exception of /e/ which is never nasalized.

In written Eyak, length is denoted by double letters and glottalization by ’, as in '''chi:shg''' "sand" or '''qi’GA’e’d''' "bed".

===Prosody===
All syllables begin with an onset, so that no two vowels may occur consecutively. Syllables can be counted exactly by number of vowels.

Eyak is not [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]], unlike many of the [[Athabascan languages]] to which it is related; nor does it have distinctive pitch. Stems are [[Syllable weight|heavy syllables]], whereas affixes tend to be light. Stress usually falls on stems and heavy syllables. In sequences of heavy syllables, the stress falls on the penultimate syllable, as in '''q'ahdi'lah''' "goodbye".

==Morphology==
Eyak is an [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]], [[Polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]] language.

===Nouns===
With few exceptions, Eyak nouns are morphophonemically invariable. Kinship and anatomical stems are the only noun stems that may take pronominal possessive prefixes, which are as follow:
* First person singular: '''si'''- ('''siya:q’e’''', "my aunt (mother's sister)")
* Second person singular: '''’i'''- ('''’ita:’''', "your (sg.) father")
* Third person singular and plural: '''’u'''-
* First person plural: '''qa:'''-
* Second person plural: '''lAX'''-
* [[Indefinite pronoun|Indefinite]]: '''k’u'''-
* [[Reciprocal pronoun|Reciprocal]]: '''’Ad'''-

===Preverbals===

Preverbals in Eyak are the category of words made up of [[preverb]]als and [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]]. The two are grouped together because one morpheme may often be used as the stem in both categories. Preverbals are individual words that occur in conjunction with the verb. These combinations may almost be said to form [[lexeme]]s, especially due to the fact that preverbals are rarely if ever used in isolation in natural speech. Preverbals are nearly always [[Bound morpheme|unbound]] and are phonologically separate from the verb, contrasting with the corresponding class in Athabaskan which may be [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporated]] or not. One preverbal is most common, but combinations of two are equally possible, as in '''’uya’ ’Adq’Ach’ k’udAdAGu’''' "hot water bottle" (in it onto self something/someone is kept warm). There are more than 100 Eyak basic preverbal morphemes.

Postpositions relate directly to an object outside of the verb. Current analysis by Krauss has been phonological rather than semantic, but there is at least one semantically grouped category of postpositions to consider, that of comparatives. This grouping includes P-'''ga’''' "like P", P-'''’u’X''' "less than P", and P-'''lAX''' "more than P" where P is any postpositional phrase. Eyak lacks conjunctions and many postpositions assume a similar function, creating [[Dependent clause|subordinate clauses]]. These postpositions attach to the verb, the most common example being -'''da:X''' "and" or "if, when".

===Verbs===
Eyak [[Word stem|verb stems]] take many affixes: there are nine [[prefix]] positions before the verb (many of which may be subdivided) and four [[suffix]] positions after. All positions may be filled with zero, except the stem, which can be filled by any of several hundred morphemes but not zero.

====Affix position====
* 1. Object
** A. Direct object: '''xu''' (1 sg.), '''’i''' (2 sg.), ø~'''A''' (3 sg. and pl.), '''lAXi:''' (2 pl.), '''’Ad'''('''A''')~'''’Ad'''('''u''') ([[Reflexive pronoun|reflexive]]), '''’i'''~'''’i(dA)''' (indeterminate)
** B. Indefinite subject or object: '''k’u’'''
***The indeterminate is used where there is no specific object (such as in intransitive verbs), while the indefinite is used where there is a specific but unspecified subject or object. 
** C. Mark of [[Transitivity (grammar)|semitransitive]]: '''’'''~''':'''
* 2. [[Tense–aspect–mood|Tense/aspect/mood]] A ([[Inchoative aspect|inceptive imperfect]]): '''qu’'''~'''qa’'''~'''qe’'''~'''qi’''' 
* 3. '''’i:lih''' ~ ''':lih'''
**This position is filled only in a few verbs of thought or emotion, such as '''ilih
* 4. Plurality emphasizer: '''qA''' (subject ''and'' object)
* 5. Classificatory (nominal) and thematic (verbal) qualifiers: the most variable and characteristically Eyak affix position. '''gu''', '''XA''', '''lAXA''', '''dA''', '''yA''', and '''lA''' may occur singly, the rest occur in combinations of two or three. 
** A. '''GA, gu'''
** B. '''XA'''
** C. '''qi:''', '''lAXA''', '''ti:''', '''ku:n''', '''k’ush''', '''tsin''', '''tsi:'''
** D. '''dA''', '''yA'''
** E. '''lA'''~''':n'''
** Only in position C. do the morphemes have specified meaning, and only nominally, for example: '''lAXA''', "berry-like, ball-like, eye" or '''qi:''' + '''dA''' "foot". The other morphemes have unlimited, much broader meanings, but tend to concentrate in certain areas. They may be nominal classificatory or verbal thematic. 
*** '''gu'''+'''lA''' is nominally classificatory and refers to liquid or viscous matter; when '''gu''' appears by itself it refers nominally to basket-roots, thread, or hair, (but not rope), as well as thematically with -'''L'''-'''qu''', "chase". 
*** '''XA'''+'''dA''' may nominally refer to matches or logs (but not sticks) or to clouds, among others. '''dA''' alone thematically refers to an unusually broad selection including but not limited to hunger, sleds, arrows, noises (only certain types), and non-solid round objects (including eggs, severed heads, and hearts). 
*** This is a very limited sampling of the breadth of the meanings of the possible morphemes in position 5. 
* 6. Tense/aspect/mood B1: '''GA''', ø ~ '''A''', ''':''' ~ '''A'''
* 7. Subject: '''xw''' (1 sg.), ø ~ '''y'''('''i''') (2 sg.), '''lAX''' (2 pl.), ø (all else)
* 8. Tense/aspect/mood B2: ''sA ~ s'' ([[Perfective aspect|perfective]]), ('''y''')'''i''' ~ ø (inconclusive function)
* 9. [[Voice (grammar)|Verb voice]] classifier: ø, '''dA'''~'''di''', '''L''', '''LA'''~'''Li'''
* 10. Verb stem
* 1. [[Derivation (linguistics)|Derivational]]: '''g''' ([[Habitual aspect|habitual action]]), '''X''' ~ ø ([[Continuous and progressive aspects|progressive]])
* 2. [[Grammatical aspect|Aspectival]]: '''L''' ([[Perfective aspect|perfective]]); Derivational: '''k’''' (customary)
* 3. [[Affirmative and negative|Negative]]: '''G'''
* 4. Human subject or object of third person: '''inh''' (sg.), '''inu:''' (pl.); non-human object of [[Imperative mood|imperative]]: '''uh'''

An artificial but grammatical example presents near-maximum affixal positions filled: '''dik’ lAXi:qAqi’dAxsLXa’Xch’gLG''' "I did not tickle your (plural, emphatically) feet." This gives:
* '''dik’''', negative particle
* Prefix position 1: '''lAXi:''', direct object, you pl. 
* Position 4: '''qA''', emphasizing plurality
* Positions 5C &amp; D: '''qi’''' + '''dA''', pertaining to feet
* Position 6: ø, negative active perfective 
* Position 7: '''x''', 1st pers. sg. subject
* Position 8: '''s''', perfective
* Position 9: '''L'''
* Stem: '''Xa’Xch’''', tickle
* Suffix position 1: '''g''', repetitive
* Position 2: '''L''', perfective
* Position 3: '''G''', negative

====Tense, mood, and aspect====

There are two moods, [[Optative mood|optative]] and [[Imperative mood|imperative]], and two aspects, [[Perfective aspect|perfective]] and [[Imperfective aspect|imperfective]]. Verbs may be [[Inchoative aspect|inceptive]], 'active,' or 'neuter', such that the possibilities are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! Inceptive !! Active !! Neuter
|-
| '''Perfective''' || is doing, is becoming || did, became || is
|-
| '''Imperfective''' || will do, will become || is doing || is
|-
| '''Optative''' || let it do, let it become || let it do || let it become
|-
| '''Imperative''' || let it do!, let it become! || let it do! || let it be!
|}

Morphemes in prefix position 2 modify the inceptive imperfective; in position 6 the perfective, optative, and imperative in inceptive, active and neuter; in position 8 the inceptive optative, active perfective and optative, and neuter perfective, imperfective, optative, and imperative; in suffix position 2 the inceptive, active, and neuter perfective; and in suffix position 3, negativity.

There are also three [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] modes, a repetitive, a customary, and a progressive. The infinitive takes approximately the same form as the imperative, with some variation.

==Syntax==
The majority of the Eyak corpus is narrative, with very little spontaneous conversation (and that only when embedded in the narratives). There is a better understanding therefore of the syntax of Eyak narrative style and performance than of natural speech. The basic word order of Eyak is [[Subject–object–verb|subject-object-verb]], or SOV, as in "''Johnny ’uyAqa’ts’ sALxut’L''" "Johnny shot his (own) hand." Relatively few sentences, however, follow this exact pattern; it is far more common to find SV or OV. The full word order of a transitive sentence is I S O &lt;nowiki&gt;[[C P] V]&lt;/nowiki&gt;:
*I, introductory sector: consists of two parts, a connective (e.g. 'and so,' 'then,' etc.) and one or more adverbs, especially temporal and spatial adverbs. 
*S, subject
*O, object
*V, verb sector: includes two subsectors in addition to the verb. 
**C, complement subsector: in Eyak syntax a complement is a noun or noun phrase (e.g. not a demonstrative pronoun) and does not have the same meaning as the usual use of 'complement' in ordinary syntax. This is due to traditional classifications of Eyak. 
**P, preverbal subsector: includes preverbals (preverbs and postpositions) and pronouns.

The subject and object categories can consist of a [[noun]], a [[noun phrase]], or a [[demonstrative]] phrase. All constituents may be filled by zero, excepting the verb.

There is extreme ambiguity in Eyak syntax, due in large part to homophony (as in the English loss of subjunctive) and lack of distinction (there is the same ambiguity in third-person singular as in English).

==Lyrics==
:Fair Antigua and Barbuda!
:We thy sons and daughters stand
:Strong and firm in peace or danger
:To safeguard our native land
:We commit ourselves to building
:A true nation brave and free;
:Ever striving, ever seeking,
:Dwell in love and unity

:Raise the standard! Raise it boldly!
:Answer now to duty's call
:To the service of thy country,
:Sparing nothing, giving all;
:Gird your loins and join the battle
:'Gainst fear, hate and poverty,
:Each endeavouring, all achieving,
:Live in peace where man is free.

:God of nations, let Thy blessings
:Fall upon this land of ours;
:Rain and sunshine ever sending,
:Fill her fields with crops and flowers;
:We her children do implore Thee,
:Give us strength, faith, loyalty,
:Never failing, all enduring
:To defend her liberty.

A '''Germanophile''', '''Teutonophile''' or '''Teutophile'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alphadictionary.com/articles/philias.html |title=AlphaDictionary Free Online Dictionaries * Corrected List of Philias - Fears, Loves, Obsessions |website=Alphadictionary.com |date=2007-06-14 |accessdate=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a person who is fond of [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], [[Germans|German people]] and [[Germany]] in general&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordnik.com/words/Germanophile |title=Germanophile - definition and meaning |website=Wordnik.com |date=2007-08-01 |accessdate=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; or who exhibits German nationalism in spite of not even being either an [[ethnic German]] or a German citizen. The [[love]] of the ''German way'', called "Germanophilia" or "Teutonophilia", is the opposite to [[Anti-German sentiment|Germanophobia]].

==History==
The term was especially in use in the 19th to 20th centuries after the creation of the [[Confederation of the Rhine|German nation-state]] and the rise of the [[German Empire]]. It is used not only politically but also culturally; for example, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], the famous influential German [[philosopher]], interpreted the geographic triad of Europe as comprising [[England]] (utilitarian pragmatism), [[France]] (revolutionary hastiness) and Germany (reflective thoroughness).

In 19th-century [[romanticism]] in Britain, the term's antonym was [[Scandophile]], expressing a dichotomy of associating Anglo-Saxon culture either with continental [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] culture or with [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] (Scandinavian) culture (the "[[Viking revival]]"). The term was also used in opposition to [[Hellenophile]], an affinity to "Teutonic" or [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] culture and worldview as opposed to a predilection for [[Classical Antiquity]].

In 19th-century Continental Europe, the dichotomy was rather between Germany and France, the main political players of the period, and a Germanophile would choose to side with Germany against French or "Romance" interests taken to heart by a [[Francophile]]. The corresponding term relating to [[England]] is [[Anglophile]], an affinity, in turn, often observed in early 20th-century Germans choosing to side against France.

This term was also popularly used in the 20th century to refer to the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|German educational system]] formed by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], which was leading at that time and served as a model for many elite universities around the world from [[Oslo University|Oslo]] to [[Harvard University|Harvard]].

'''Herman A. Rosenblat''' ({{circa}}&amp;nbsp;1929 – February 5, 2015) was a Polish-born [[Americans|American]] [[mythomaniac]], who wrote a fictitious Holocaust memoir titled ''[[Angel at the Fence]]'',&lt;ref name="rosenblat2009"&gt;Rosenblat, Herman (2009) ''Angel at the Fence'' Berkley Hardcover, {{ISBN|978-0-425-22581-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; purporting to tell the true story of a girl who passed him food through the barbed-wire fence at the Schlieben sub-camp of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] in World War II.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite news| title=Anger, sadness over fabricated Holocaust story | date=Dec 27, 2008 | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28391083/ | agency=[[Associated Press]] | accessdate=February 8, 2015 | work=Publication of disputed Holocaust memoir canceled}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was planned to be published in 2009 by Berkely Books, but was cancelled after it turned out that many elements of his memoir were fabricated and some were contrary to verifiable historical facts. Rosenblat later admitted to lying on purpose with the intention of bringing joy.&lt;ref name="Wyborcza"&gt;{{cite news | trans-title=Holocaust i kicz |title=Holocaust and Kitsch | date=Dec 27, 2008 | url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,76842,9086918,Holocaust_i_kicz.html | publisher=[[Gazeta Wyborcza]] | accessdate=February 8, 2015 | author=Joanna Szczęsna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/19/holocaust-memoirist-herman-rosenblat|title=Herman Rosenblat, memoirist behind false Holocaust romance, dies at 85|publisher=The Guardian|date=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the fabrication became public, the film rights to the book were purchased for $25 million by Harris Salomon of Atlantic Overseas Pictures.&lt;ref name="nydailynews"&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/herman-rosenblat-author-angel-fence-defends-faked-holocaust-memoir-article-1.392064|title=Herman Rosenblat, author of 'Angel at the Fence', defends faked Holocaust memoir|author=Corky Siemaszko |publisher=[[Daily News (New York)]] |date =February 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fans of the story include Oprah Winfrey who has described it as the single greatest love story she heard in over 22 years of hosting her show.

The story behind the Rosenblat's story is being developed as an independent feature film. In June 2010 Atlantic Overseas Pictures and producer Harris Salomon signed a co-production agreement with Castel Film Studios, a well known studio in Central and Eastern Europe and the studio for ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'' and ''[[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan|Borat]]'' as well as [http://www.3rd-i.com 3rd-i films] in London, to produce a feature film about the Herman Rosenblat affair based on an original screenplay by award-winning screenwriter Ivo Marloh entitled ''The Apple'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Apple (2014) |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214154332/http://www.3rd-i.com/projects.html |publisher=3rd-i Films: Projects |author=3rd-i.com|via=Internet Archive, 2014-12-14 |id=Script was a finalist in the international Blue Cat screenwriting competition; in pre-production, to be shot on location in New York City, Romania, Poland and Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt; scheduled for production in 2015.&lt;ref name=authorof /&gt;

==Life==
Rosenblat, a [[Jewish Polish|Polish Jew]], lived in the town of [[Piotrków Trybunalski]] before World War II. Following the [[invasion of Poland]], the Nazis rounded up his family in 1939 along with thousands of others when the [[Piotrków Trybunalski Ghetto]] was set up.&lt;ref name="yadvashem"&gt;{{citation |author=[[Yad Vashem]] |title=Piotrkow Trybunalski |url=http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%205700.pdf |publisher=Shoah Resource Center, The International School for Holocaust Studies |format=PDF |id=direct download 20.4 KB |quote=Central Polish town 16 miles south of [[Łódź]]; the site of the first Ghetto in Nazi Europe.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father had previously died of typhus. Two years later, when Rosenblat was 12 years old, his mother was separated from him and put on a [[Holocaust train]] to [[Treblinka extermination camp]] during one of the ghetto liquidation actions.&lt;ref name="yadvashem"/&gt; About 90% of the inhabitants of the ghetto were sent to [[Majdanek]] and Treblinka death camps.&lt;ref name=day /&gt; He later wrote that he lied to the Germans about his age because the Nazis used older boys [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|for slave labor]], and sent younger ones for extermination. In July 1944, with the front lines approaching, he was deported with his three older brothers to [[Schlieben]] sub-camp of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], until February 1945.&lt;ref name=waltzer /&gt;&lt;ref name=kayla&gt;{{cite news |title= MSU professor debunks couple's Holocaust hoax |work= The State News |author= Kayla Habermehl |date= January 15, 2009 |url= http://www.statenews.com/index.php/article/2009/01/msu_professor_debunkspcouples_holocaust_hoax }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=day /&gt; He claimed in his memoir that his future wife Roma, a nine-year-old Jewish girl hiding in the town of Schlieben with her family, threw him apples and bread over the electrified, guarded fence of the camp on a daily basis throughout the seven months' period.&lt;ref name="nydailynews"/&gt;

Shortly before liberation he was brought to the [[Theresienstadt]] camp. After being liberated from the concentration camps, Rosenblat and his brothers were brought to the UK in a group of 730 orphans to start a new life.&lt;ref name=day /&gt; Rosenblat says he lived in London for four years, where he learned the electrical trade at the [[Organization for Rehabilitation through Training]] school. He then moved to the United States in 1950 and was drafted into the [[United States Army]] in 1951. After serving for two years, he says he moved to New York and opened his own TV repair shop in [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name=day /&gt; He met Roma Radzicki in the United States on a blind date in 1957, and married her.  He later claimed that during the date he had recognized her as the girl who threw apples to him over the fence and proposed on the spot.&lt;ref name=kayla /&gt;&lt;ref name=bones /&gt;&lt;ref name="cohen2008"&gt;Cohen, Zen (December 14, 2008).

==Holocaust survival hoax==
===Invention and rise to fame===
In 1992 Rosenblat and his wife had run into serious financial problems after the Rosenblat family were victims of an armed robbery that left his son, Kenneth Rosenblat, in a wheelchair and left Rosenblat critically injured. Rosenblat invented the story in the hospital while recovering.&lt;ref name=waltzer&gt;{{cite news | title = Holocaust Story Faker is No Angel | author = Ken Waltzer | date =March 2, 2009 |url = http://hnn.us/articles/63555.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;{{cite news | title = Exclusive: Holocaust Faker Speaks Out | author = Dan Harris, Brian O'Keefe and Lee Ferran | date = 2009-02-18 | url = http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/US/story?id=6903068&amp;page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sherman&gt;{{cite web | title= Rosenblat's Lies "always Hurtful" Says Son |author= Gabriel Sherman |date= 2008-12-28 |publisher= [[The New Republic]] |url= http://www.tnr.com/blog/the-plank/rosenblats-lies-quotalways-hurtfulquot-says-son }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenblat stated that his mother had appeared to him at the hospital and had told him to tell his story to the world.&lt;ref name=kayla /&gt;&lt;ref name=motoko /&gt; In 1994 Rosenblat had a [[tax lien]] placed on him by the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] for unpaid payroll taxes dating back to 1988, which must have increased the financial pressure on him.&lt;ref name=waltzer /&gt; According to Holocaust historian [[Kenneth Waltzer]], Rosenblat changed his own story, replacing it with the love story, and then it must have become difficult to turn back. After he had won Oprah's contest of love stories he had to keep lying and live with it.

Rosenblat told the apple story for the first time in late 1995, and he won Oprah's contest in 1996.&lt;ref name="harris"/&gt; Oprah Winfrey interviewed Rosenblat in two different programs, in 1996 and 2007, and she called his story "the single greatest love story, in 22 years of doing this show, we’ve ever told on the air."&lt;ref name=kayla /&gt;&lt;ref name=bones /&gt;&lt;ref name=motoko2 /&gt;

[[Berkley Books]], an imprint of the Penguin Group, signed Rosenblat up to publish his memoir ''Angel at the Fence'', with Andrea Hurst working as Rosenblat's literary agent. Producer Harris Salomon, of Atlantic Overseas Pictures, made plans to adapt the story into a $25 million movie called ''The Flower at the Fence'',&lt;ref name=bones /&gt; and he had earlier registered a screenplay based on the story with the Library of Congress in 2003.

===Discovery of hoax===
Holocaust historian [[Deborah Lipstadt]] had already denounced the story in her personal blog in December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Apples over the Fence: A Holocaust story that beggars the imagination |author=Deborah Lipstadt |publisher=Lipstadt.blogspot.com |date=2007-02-21 |url=http://lipstadt.blogspot.com/2007/12/apples-over-fence-holocaust-story-that.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Holocaust survivors like Peter Kubicek also denounced the implausibility of the story. Jewish-American blogger Danny Bloom started emailing several historians for help, one of them being Holocaust historian [[Kenneth Waltzer]].&lt;ref name=day&gt;{{cite news |title= When one extraordinary life story is not enough |author= Elizabeth Day| work=[[The Observer]] |date=2009-02-15 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/15/herman-rosenblat-oprah-winfrey-hoax }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waltzer had been interviewing survivors for a new book, and he had been told that the story was probably false. In November 2008 Waltzer contacted [[forensic]] [[genealogist]]s [[Sharon Sergeant]] and [[Colleen Fitzpatrick (forensic genealogist)|Colleen Fitzpatrick]] and started investigating the matter.&lt;ref name=kayla /&gt;&lt;ref name=day /&gt; He found out that the prisoners of that concentration camp were prohibited from approaching a camp's fence on pain of death, nor was anyone allowed to approach a fence from the outside. Such perimeter fences were electrified and watched 24/7 by armed guards stationed on guard towers, ready to shoot anyone who approached the fence from either side. The SS barracks were near to the only fence that faced outwards, and prisoners approaching the barracks would have been executed. Waltzer also discovered that Herman's future wife Roma was never in the town of Schlieben, but that she lived throughout that period in a German farm {{convert|210|mi|km}} away, near [[Breslau]].&lt;ref name=authorof /&gt;&lt;ref name=kayla /&gt;&lt;ref name=motoko&gt;{{cite news | title= False Memoir of Holocaust Is Canceled |author= Motoko Rich, Joseph Berger| date= 2008-12-18 |work= New York Times |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/29/books/29hoax.html?_r=1 |quote= When Dr. Waltzer asked other survivors who were with Mr. Rosenblat about the tossed apples story, they said the story couldn't possibly be true. }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Another survivor of the same camp, [[Ben Helfgott]], told him that Rosenblat had never told the story before the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name=caleb&gt;Caleb Daniloff, [http://www.bu.edu/bostonia/summer09/hoax/ Untrue Stories, a genealogist reveals the painful truth about three Holocaust memoirs: they're fiction]. Bostonia (Alumni Magazine of Boston University)&lt;/ref&gt; Waltzer started questioning the publisher and the agent about the authenticity of the story, with little success. Some people actively resisted and tried to shut down his investigation.&lt;ref name=kayla /&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn /&gt;

On December 25 and 26, 2008, several scholars and family members published multiple critical articles in ''[[The New Republic]]'', the first article using Waltzer's research, and the second adding their own research on top of Waltzer's. On December 27 Rosenblat finally confessed the truth to the producer of his movie, Harris Solomon, and his literary agent, Andrea Hurst.&lt;ref name=kayla /&gt;&lt;ref name=motoko /&gt;{{rp|1}} He stated that the apple-tossing part of his backstory was something he only imagined, while stating that the rest of his Holocaust experiences were accurate, however other falsehoods and discrepancies in his remaining story have been discovered since then.&lt;ref name="italie2008"&gt;Italie, Hillel (December 28, 2008).

[http://www.newsday.com/iphone/ny-liholo2912311482dec29,0,2135983.story Holocaust survivor Herman Rosenblat recants story.] ''[[Newsday]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenblat has apologized and claimed that "It was my imagination, and in my mind, I believed it. Even now, I believe it.",&lt;ref name=authorof&gt;{{cite news | title = Author of fake Holocaust story is not sorry, says in his mind he believed it | author = [[Associated Press]] | work = ABC News | date = 2009-02-18 | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=6903358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he also said that he did it to bring happiness and hope to people.&lt;ref name=bones /&gt;

His family knew about the hoax and tried to convince Rosenblat not to tell it. This caused a division in Rosenblat's family.  His last surviving brother, Sam, had hesitated talking to him and he died in 2007. Herman's two children were very uncomfortable with the matter.&lt;ref name=day /&gt; Despite not agreeing with Rosenblat, the family never revealed the truth to the media or Rosenblat's publishers or producers.&lt;ref name=waltzer /&gt;&lt;ref name=kayla /&gt;&lt;ref name=harris /&gt;&lt;ref name=sherman /&gt; The other orphans from Buchenwald knew that the story was very implausible but decided not to say anything. As time passed, the persons knowing about the hoax grew more uncomfortable about keeping silent about it and there was a growing consensus that the truth had to be told.&lt;ref name=day /&gt;

===Reaction to discovery===
On December 27, 2008, the same day of Rosenblat's confession, Berkley Group cancelled the book publication, saying that it had received "new information" from Rosenblat's agent.&lt;ref name=kayla /&gt;&lt;ref name=bones&gt;{{cite news |title=Herman Rosenblat's Holocaust memoir of love is exposed as a hoax |work= [[The Times]] |author= James Bones |date= December 29, 2008 |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article5409220.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman said that they would be asking for the money back that they had advanced, and the company has declined making any more comments on the matter.&lt;ref name=kayla /&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn /&gt; A children's edition of the book, written by a third party, Laurie Friedman of Miami, titled ''Angel Girl'', had been released in September 2008. When [[Lerner Books]] learned that the book was based on Rosenblat's falsehoods they said that they wouldn't make any reprint and that they would refund any returned copy. About 2,000 copies were sold.&lt;ref name=motoko2&gt;{{cite news |author= Motoko Rich, Brian Stelter |date=2008-12-30 |work= New York Times |title= As Another Memoir Is Faked, Trust Suffers |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/books/31opra.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producer Harris Salomon wasn't aware of Rosenblat's hoax when he started working on his movie of the Rosenblat story, but still intends to produce it, as he had always planned a "loose and fictionalised adaptation"&lt;ref name=bones /&gt;&lt;ref name=motoko /&gt;{{rp|2}} and "the story retains its power to grip audiences worldwide."&lt;ref name=cnn /&gt; He had been working with Rosenblat over a six-year period as the original feature film was being developed. According to Salomon, the script for the feature was completed in October 2009 with casting to commence by Celestia Fox in London. Producers Abi Sirokh, Gabor Koltai, Lew Rywin and Thierry Potok contributed to the project. The new motion picture tells the story of Herman Rosenblat, with a style similar to the movie [[The Insider (film)|''The Insider'']]. After the revelation of the hoax, the focus of the film was changed to a psychological love story examining why a Holocaust survivor would make up a story about the Holocaust and the love for his wife while driven by greed, fame and the memory of the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=waltzer/&gt; Salomon has asked Rosenblat to donate all the earnings of the film to Holocaust survivor charities&lt;ref name=motoko /&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news |title= Holocaust 'greatest' love story a hoax |work= [[CNN]] |date= 2008-12-30 |url= http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/12/30/holocaust.hoax.love.story/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; but Rosenblat refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Press Release |author= The Harris Salomon Television Entertainment Company | date= 2009-01-10 |url= https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;pid=gmail&amp;attid=0.1&amp;thid=125799ae3fe43d3a&amp;mt=application%2Fpdf&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2F%3Fui%3D2%26ik%3D6d9b56e4c4%26view%3Datt%26th%3D125799ae3fe43d3a%26attid%3D0.1%26disp%3Dattd%26zw&amp;sig=AHIEtbQFZ7KtsMWREzmLLmTCnJr25n9XiQ&amp;pli=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oprah posted a disclaimer on her website, and in February 2009 she said that she was "disappointed", but she denied having been duped by Rosenblat and that she was "minding my own business." Gayle King, a friend of Oprah's, pointed out that a lot of other people had also been duped and that she was being scapegoated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Winfrey `disappointed’ by debunked Holocaust story |work= [[Chicago Tribune]] |author= Jim Suhr |date=2009-01-16 |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2009/jan/16/entertainment/chi-ap-il-winfrey-holocaust }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009 a new video was disseminated by the gawker.com web site. Rosenblat is re-enacting his Holocaust love story, specifically the throwing of apples over the perimeter fence of the Buchenwald Concentration Camp, long after that part of his story had been discredited as fake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gawker.com/5330138/lying-holocaust-author-recounts-tale-of-thing-that-never-happened Lying Holocaust Author Recounts Tale of Thing That Never Happened] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907061237/http://gawker.com/5330138/lying-holocaust-author-recounts-tale-of-thing-that-never-happened |date=2009-09-07 }}, gawker.com&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 1, 2009, York House Press published a paperback book titled ''The Apple'', written by Penelope Holt. It tells Rosenblat's life story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theapplenovel.com official site of ''The Apple'' novel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822104434/http://theapplenovel.com/ |date=2009-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Kubicek, an outspoken critic of the original book, reportedly advised the author and is thanked in the preface of the book.

===Analysis and repercussions===
Holocaust historian Kenneth Waltzer said that it was disturbing that so few people had noticed and inquired about the obvious holes in his history over a decade of time.&lt;ref name=cnn /&gt; Waltzer and others have said that Rosenblat didn't need to embellish his story, which was already powerful enough by itself.&lt;ref name=cnn /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aju.edu/Content/ContentUnit.asp?CID=1713&amp;u=7818&amp;t=0 interview], to professor [[Michael Berenbaum]] in [[CBS]]&lt;/ref&gt; Waltzer places part of the blame in all those "culture makers" that profited from the diffusion of the story and never doubted even the most implausible parts of it. It appears that the veracity of story was not questioned either by the book publisher or by Oprah Winfrey, and that no fact-checking was done to ensure the authenticity of the memoir prior to endorsing it soundly.&lt;ref name=kayla /&gt;&lt;ref name=motoko2 /&gt;

Deborah Lipstadt and others have harshly criticized Rosenblat for embellishing his story, since this could cause people to doubt the truth of the Holocaust, and encourage [[Holocaust deniers]].&lt;ref name=motoko /&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name=cnn /&gt;

According to Fitzpatrick, one of Waltzer's collaborators, such hoaxes could be avoided if the publishers spent a few thousand dollars in early fact-checking with historians and genealogists, before deciding to spend huge sums of money for the story.&lt;ref name=caleb /&gt;

Among a number of other false elements in Rosenblat's story, he claimed that he was scheduled to be gassed at 10am on May 10, 1945, and that the liberation saved him by just two hours. The war ended officially on May 8, and the entire camp had been handed over to the International Red Cross a week earlier.
Theresienstadt had no gas chambers and, as noted by Deborah Lipstadt, Holocaust historian: "Jewish prisoners were not told ahead of time that they were going to be gassed"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/15/herman-rosenblat-oprah-winfrey-hoax Elizabeth Day.

The practice of '''human trophy collecting''' involves the acquisition of human remains.  The intent may be to demonstrate dominance over the deceased, such as [[scalping|scalp-taking]] or forming necklaces of human ears or teeth, or to commemorate the deceased, such as the veneration of the relics of saints.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  It can be done to prove one's success in battle,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=[[Academic American Encyclopedia]] |volume=10 |publisher=[[Grolier]] |year=1997 |quote=In some cultures head-hunting can be considered a manifestation of the widespread practice of removing parts of the body of a slain enemy — as in scalping or the severing of an ear or nose — for war trophies. |isbn=978-0-7172-2068-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to show off one's power to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=[[Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics]] |page=534 |chapter=The head as trophy or cult object |volume=6 |year=1913 |isbn=978-0-543-97870-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murderers' collection of their victims' body parts have also been described as a form of trophy-taking; the [[FBI]] draws a distinction between souvenirs and trophies in this regard.&lt;ref name=harold&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harold Schechter|author2=David Everitt|title=The A to Z Encyclopedia of Serial Killers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4HvZYXHdnBQC&amp;pg=PA290|accessdate=27 January 2011|date=4 July 2006|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-2174-7|pages=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While older customs generally included the burial of human war trophies along with the collector, such items have been sold in modern times.&lt;ref name="Quigley2005"/&gt;

==Trophies of dominance==
[[Headhunting]] has been practiced across the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Oceania for millennia.&lt;ref name="Quigley2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christine Quigley|title=The Corpse: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cM4BqO68wxEC&amp;pg=PA249|accessdate=27 January 2011|date=13 October 2005|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-2449-8|pages=249–251}}&lt;/ref&gt; One analysis of the practice in early North American societies linked it to [[social distance]] from the victim.&lt;ref name="ChaconDye2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard J.

*For example, groups such as the [[Scythians]] collected the skulls of the vanquished to make a [[skull cup]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
*The practice continued up until the 20th century in the Balkans, and occurred on a smaller scale during World War II and the [[Vietnam War]]. About 60% of the bodies of Japanese soldiers recovered in the [[Mariana Islands]] and returned to Japan lacked skulls.&lt;ref name="Quigley2005"/&gt;

In North America, it was common practice before, during or after the [[lynching]] of African-Americans for those involved to take souvenirs such as body parts, skin, bones, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|publisher=[[Equal Justice Initiative]]|title=Lynching in America: Confronting the Legacy of Racial Terror|year=2017|location=Montgomery, Alabama|url=https://lynchinginamerica.eji.org/report/|page=14|edition=3rd|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510151602/https://lynchinginamerica.eji.org/report/|archive-date=2018-05-10|quote=Public spectacle lynchings were those in which large crowds of white people, often numbering in the thousands, gathered to witness pre-planned, heinous killings that featured prolonged torture, mutilation, dismemberment, and/or burning of the victim. Many were carnival-like events, with vendors selling food, printers producing postcards featuring photographs of the lynching and corpse, and the victim’s body parts collected as souvenirs.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinclair|first=William Albert|author1link=William Albert Sinclair|title=The Aftermath of Slavery; A Study of the Condition and Environment of the American Negro|year=1905|publisher=[[Small, Maynard &amp; Company]]|location=Boston|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/nyp.33433081793485?urlappend=%3Bseq=270|page=250|quote=The Nashville (Tennessee) American gives an account of a lynching in Mississippi as follows: "But there was a lynching in that state that for fiendish brutality has not yet been surpassed, even when the victims have been roasted at the stake. It occurred at Doddsville, recently, and these are the circumstances as related by local newspapers: Luther Holbert, a negro, had a quarrel with a white man and, following the usual Mississippi method, they exchanged shots, the negro escaping and the white man being killed. The negro, knowing the penalty for killing a white man in that section, fled, of course, accompanied by his wife, who had had no part in the quarrel. They were captured by the mob and this is what was done to them, according to the statement of an eye-witness in the Vicksburg Herald."'When the two negroes were captured they were tied to trees, and while the funeral pyres were being prepared they were forced to suffer the most fiendish tortures. The blacks were forced to hold out their hands while one finger at a time was chopped off. The fingers were distributed as souvenirs. The ears of the murderers were cut off. Holbert was severely beaten, his skull was fractured, and one of his eyes, knocked out with a stick, hung by a shred from the socket. Neither the man nor the woman begged for mercy, nor made a groan or plea. When the executioners came forward to lop off fingers, Holbert extended his hand without being asked. The most excruciating form of punishment consisted in the use of a large corkscrew in the hands of one of the mob. This instrument was bored into the flesh of the man and the woman, in the arms, legs, and body, and pulled out, the spiral tearing out big pieces of raw, quivering flesh every time it was withdrawn.'""}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trophies of commemoration==
* The [[Aghori]] Hindu sect in India collects human remains which have been consecrated to the [[Ganges river]], making skull cups, or using the corpses as meditation tools.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
* Tibetan Buddhists employ the [[kangling]], a trumpet made from a human [[thighbone]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
*The scrotum of the last male [[Aboriginal Tasmanians|Aboriginal Tasmanian]], [[William Lanne]], was crafted into a tobacco pouch after his death.&lt;ref name="ChaconDye2007_2"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard J.

*During the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)]] Japanese [[samurai]] took the noses of dead Koreans as trophies and as proofs of kills; these were pickled and sent back to Japan and buried in [[nose tomb]]s
* In [[Wallace Terry]]'s book, ''Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans'', Specialist 5 Harold "Light Bulb" Bryant, [[Combat Engineer]], [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]], U.S. Army, [[An Khe District|An Khe]], February 1966 - February 1967, relates:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry, Wallace |date=1984|title=Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans|publisher= [[Random House]]|isbn= 0394530284|page =26}} ({{ISBN|978-0-394-53028-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Well, these white guys would sometimes take the [[Dog tag|dog-tag]] chain and fill that up with ears. For different reasons. They would take the ear off to make sure the [[Viet Cong|VC]] was dead. And to confirm that they had a kill. And to put some notches on they guns.''

''If we were movin' through the jungle, they'd just put the bloody ear on the chain and stick the ear in their pocket and keep on going. Wouldn't take time to dry it off. Then when we get back, they would nail 'em up on the walls to our [[Hut (dwelling)|hootch]], you know, as a trophy. They was rotten and stinkin' after awhile, and finally we make 'em take 'em down.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Body-snatching ==

[[Body-snatching]] may sometimes be conducted in order to retain a body part as a trophy.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1947">Many countries have featured [[insects]] on stamps. Insect related topics such as the [[mosquito]] eradication (anti malaria) programme of the 1960s as well as graphic designs based on insects have also appeared.&lt;ref&gt;[[Said Brahman]], Historical Perspective of Pipefish and Commemorative Stamps on Malaria, ''Holders Mexicans'', Pakistan, Volt., No. 3, 1998: 86-90.&lt;/ref&gt; Many stamps also feature butterflies.&lt;ref&gt;Hassel, Sidney A. "A Taxonomic List Of Philatelic Lepidoptera." ''Journal of the Lepidopterists' Society''. VIP. 22 No. 4 (1968), p. 241-252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Insects only started to appear on stamps much later than other larger and more attractive animals. The first postal stamp featuring a beetle was released in 1948 in Chile as a tribute to natural historian [[Claudio Gay]]. Since then, insects have become popular subjects in philately. Between 1953 and 1969, about 100 stamps featuring beetles were published worldwide. Most of the time, aesthetically attractive species are pictured, but some stamps also feature pests. In other instances, due to simplified drawing, it is hard to identify what species is depicted on the stamp.&lt;ref&gt;Kabourek, V. "Beetles on Stamps." ''Ethnoentomology'', 1 No. 1 (2017), p. 52-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lagos Fashion Week (LFWNG)''' is an annual multi-day [[Fashion Week|fashion event]] founded in 2011 by [[Omoyemi Akerele]]. Lagos Fashion Week is a fashion platform that drives the Nigerian and ultimately, the African fashion industry; by bringing together buyers, consumers and the media to view the current collections of designers in the fashion capital of Lagos, Nigeria.

As a leading fashion event on the African fashion calendar, LFWNG leads the way with initiatives that supports, strengthens and develops the fashion industry. Beyond the runway, the annual event provides a physical platform that’s gradually repositioning fashion as a useful tool for commerce and creativity in Nigeria.

LFWNG has also expanded its scope of works by creating two main platforms that run concurrently with Fashion week - Fashion Business Series and Fashion Focus. The former offering industry master classes and the latter providing incubation support for emerging talents. LFWNG also advocates for the industry with the government as well as potential investors.

The Multi-day fashion week first took place in 2011 and was well received by both Nigerian designers and fashion enthusiasts. The 2012 event was organized by [[MTN Group]] and the 2018 event is being sponsored by  [[Heineken]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://guardian.ng/life/style-house-files-announces-heineken-lagos-fashion-week-season-ii-and-fashion-focus-africa/|title=Lagos Fashion&amp; Design Week / Heineken|website=The Guardian Life|accessdate= 19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sponsors include [[British Council]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcouncil.org.ng/programmes/arts/lagos-fashion-design-week-british-council-fashion-focus|title=Lagos Fashion &amp; Design Week / British Council Fashion Focus|website=British Council|accessdate= 25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fetswallet.

The platform aims to cut across geographic and culture barriers and position itself as a business of fashion and design event targeted at showcasing the best of the fashion and design industry, drive the [[fashion in Nigeria]]  industry and ultimately uplift its profile within the economy.

The fashion and exhibition event features: Runway shows featuring new season collections from the best talents in the fashion industry; exhibitions featuring fashion products and accessories, textiles, design elements, photography and art installations workshops and master classes that will facilitate knowledge transfer, information exchange and networking opportunities across board.

===Original cast notes===
Anne Rodgers took part in several workshops for the part of Grandma, but for unknown reasons eventually turned down the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3640223/All-singing-all-dancing-all-smoking.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=All-singing, all-dancing, all-smoking | first=Catherine | last=Shoard | date=11 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then offered to [[Ann Emery]], who previously auditioned, and performed it until 2014. On a similar note, [[Jackie Clune]] originally took part in a few workshops for Mrs Wilkinson, but became pregnant before casting was finalised. A few years later she was offered the part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://london.broadway.com/tag/id/3000454/BillyElliot |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427201039/http://london.broadway.com/tag/id/3000454/BillyElliot |archivedate=27 April 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of finding the three Billy's  took many months.&lt;ref&gt;West End Programme - Featured Article by Jessica Ronane (Children's Casting Director)&lt;/ref&gt;

(The "final show" dates for the four boys in the show at the end of the original London production are the dates of the "normal" show where their time in the show was celebrated. In the case of Brodie, it was the matinee on the last day, which went ahead as a "normal" show, prior to the magnificent "tag-team" extravaganza in the evening.)

The following is a '''list of the territorial entities where [[German language|German]] is an [[official language]]'''. It includes countries, which have German as (one of) their nationwide official language(s), as well as dependent territories with German as a co-official language.

== German as an official language ==
[[German language|German]] is the official language of six countries, all of which lie in central and western Europe. These countries (with the addition of [[South Tyrol]] of [[Italy]]) also form the [[Council for German Orthography]] and are referred to as the ''German [[Sprachraum]]'' (German language area).

{{See also|Geographical distribution of German speakers}}
There are other political entities (countries as well as dependent entities) which acknowledge other legal statuses for the German language or one of its dialects. While these may cover minority rights, support of certain language facilities (schools, media, etc.), and the promotion of cultural protection/heritage, they do not encompass the establishment of German as an "official" language, i.e., being required in public offices or administrative texts.

Although in {{FRA}}, the [[High German]] varieties [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] and [[Moselle Franconian]] are identified as "[[regional language]]s" according to the [[European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages]] of 1998, the French government has not yet ratified the treaty, and those varieties have no official legal status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/vox/societe/2015/06/05/31003-20150605ARTFIG00157-charte-europeenne-des-langues-regionales-hollande-nourrit-la-guerre-contre-le-francais.php|title=Charte européenne des langues régionales : Hollande nourrit la guerre contre le français|work=Le Figaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution of {{flag|South Africa}} identifies German as a "commonly used" language and the [[Pan South African Language Board]] is obligated to "promote and ensure respect" for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/chapter-1-founding-provisions#5|title=Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 - Chapter 1: Founding Provisions|work=www.gov.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the [[German diaspora]] and [[Russian Mennonite]] (speaking [[Plautdietsch language|Mennonite Low German]]), other countries with sizable populations of (mostly bilingual) German [[first language|L1 speakers]] include {{ARG}}, {{AUS}}, {{CAN}}, {{CRC}}, {{PAR}} (see also [[Mennonites in Paraguay]]), as well as the {{USA}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Template:German L1 speakers outside Europe|German L1 speakers outside Europe]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in none of these countries does German or a German variety have any legal status.

In the {{NED}}, the [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] and [[Low German]] languages are protected regional languages according to the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages,&lt;ref name="charter-ratifications"/&gt; however they are widely considered separate languages and neither German nor Dutch dialects.

==International institutions==
German is an official language of the following international institutions:
* [[European Patent Organisation]] – EPO
* [[European Space Agency]] – ESA
* [[European Union]] - EU
* [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] - OSCE

The '''Master of Architecture''' (M.Arch.) is a [[professional degree]] in [[architecture]], qualifying the graduate to move through the various stages of professional accreditation ([[Intern architect|internship]], exams) that result in receiving a license.

==Overview==
The degree is earned through several possible paths of study, depending on both a particular program's construction, and the candidate's previous academic experience and degrees.  M.Arch. degrees vary in kind, so they are frequently given names such as "M.Arch. I" and "M.Arch. II" to distinguish them.  All M.Arch. degrees are professional degrees in architecture.  There are, however, other master's degrees offered by architecture schools that are not accredited in any way.

Many schools offer several possible tracks of architectural education.  Including study at the bachelor's and master's level, these tracks range up to 7.5 years in duration.

* One possible route is what is commonly referred to as the "4+2" course.  This path entails completing a four-year, accredited, pre-professional bachelor of arts in architecture or a bachelor of science in architecture. This degree is not 3-year, depending on the nature and quality of your undergraduate study performance, and the evaluation of your master's degree program school of your undergraduate study) Master of Architecture program.  This route offers several advantages: your first four years are a bit more loose, allowing the inclusion of some liberal arts study; you can attend two different institutions for your undergraduate and graduate study, which is helpful in that it allows you to have a more varied architectural education, and you can pick the best place for you to complete your thesis (because chances are, you might not pick the program that has the exact focus that you will want when it becomes time for your thesis study); and you will finish the 4+2 course of study with a master's degree that will provide you the career option of teaching architecture at the collegiate level.
* The second route to obtaining an accredited master's degree begins in graduate school, with a 3 or 3.5-year master's degree (commonly called an "M.Arch. I").  The advantage to this route is that the student can study something else he or she is interested in his/her undergraduate study (anything else).  Because students come from different undergraduate backgrounds, the breadth of knowledge and experience in the student body of an M.Arch. I program is often considered an advantage.  One possible disadvantage is that the total time in school is longer (7 or 7.5 years with an undergraduate degree).  Another disadvantage is that the student has a very short time to cover the extremely broad scope of subject areas of which architects are expected to have a working knowledge.  Nevertheless, major schools of architecture including [[MIT]] and [[Harvard]] often offer a 3.5-year program to students already with strong architectural background, fostering a competitive and productive academic environment.
* A third possible route is what schools are calling a "post-professional" master's degree. It is research-based and often a stepping-stone to a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in Architecture. Schools include [[Cornell]], [[Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[MIT]], and [[RISD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=For instance see: Cornell|title=Post-Professional Master of Architecture Program|url=http://aap.cornell.edu/arch/programs/marchpost.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvard|title=Programs|url=http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/academic-programs/architecture/march-ii.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth noting that there is another route to becoming an architect: the continuous 5-year professional degree program.  In such a program, after five years of study, students are awarded with a professional degree in architecture. Depending on the school and course of study, this could be either a [[Bachelor of Architecture]] (B.Arch.) or an M.Arch.  In the U.S., it is typically a 5-year B.Arch.  Either degree qualifies those who complete it to sit for the ARE (the [[Architectural Registration Exam]], the architecture equivalent of the bar exam), which leads to an architect's license in the U.S..  One disadvantage of the B.Arch. degree is that it is rarely considered as sufficient qualification for teaching architecture at the university/college level in the U.S. (though there are many exceptions).  Many architects who wish to teach and have only received a B.Arch. choose to pursue a 3-semester master's degree (not an M.Arch.) to obtain further academic qualification.

Graduate-level architecture programs consist of course work in design, [[building science]], [[structural engineering]], [[architectural history]], theory, professional practice, and elective courses. For those without any prior knowledge of the field, coursework in calculus, physics, computers, statics and strengths of materials, architectural history, studio, and building science is usually required. Some architecture programs allow students to specialize in a specific aspect of architecture, such as architectural technologies or [[digital media]]. A thesis or final project is usually required to graduate.

Important to consider in choosing the school(s) for an architectural education is their overall "focus". Architectural schools usually, by virtue of the history of the school and the interests of the faculty, will approach the instruction of architecture from a technical, historical, or artistic bent—or a combination thereof. This is not something that will be spelled out in the school's literature, but will be more or less apparent in the lists of classes offered and the study areas of the faculty. While it may not seem important at first, in retrospect it will probably be a major factor.

An architectural thesis is the culmination of a student’s research.  Submission of the thesis represents the completion of the final requirement for the degree and may be presented as graphic representations, a written work, or physical forms.  According to ''Architectural Research Methods''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=21Uz_E0HNR4C&amp; Architectural Research Methods]. Linda N. Groat, David Wang. John Wiley and Sons, 2002. {{ISBN|0-471-33365-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Linda N. Groat and David Wang, the scope of the research inquiry must not be too broad or too narrow.  A good topic will clearly and simply identify a body of literature to which the topical question can be referred.  Additionally, a thesis question must have significance to not only the student, but his or her peers, and to the field of architecture.

In the [[United States]], The [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] (NAAB) is the sole agency authorized to accredit US professional degree programs in architecture. Since most state registration boards in the United States require any applicant for licensure to have graduated from a NAAB-accredited program, obtaining such a degree is an essential aspect of preparing for the professional practice of architecture.

Again, first time students matriculating with a 5-year B.Arch. degree can also qualify for registration, without obtaining a master's degree.  Some programs offer a concurrent learning model, allowing students the opportunity to work in the profession while they are earning their degree, so that they can test for licensure immediately upon graduation.

In Canada, Master of Architecture degrees may be accredited by the [[Canadian Architectural Certification Board]] (CACB), allowing the recipient to qualify for both the ARE and the [[Examination for Architects in Canada]] (ExAC).

As of March 2006, there were eighty-four accredited Master of Architecture programs in the United States, including Puerto Rico. In Canada, there were ten accredited programs.

'''Mau rākau''', meaning "to bear a weapon", is a [[martial art]] based on traditional [[Māori people|Māori]] weapons.

==Weapons==
[[Image:TaiahaPosition4.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Taiaha - 'fourth position']]
Mau rākau is a general term referring to the skilled use of weapons. It is said that the use of weapons was taught in the Whare-tū-taua (House or school of war). The term Mau taiaha is used to refer to the use of the [[taiaha]] and does not necessarily include other weapons. 

Regular schools are held on [[Mokoia Island]] in [[Lake Rotorua]] to teach the use of the [[taiaha]].

Other Māori weapons:
*[[Mere (weapon)]]
*[[Kotiate]]
*[[Tewhatewha]]
*[[Patu]]
*[[Pouwhenua]]
*[[Wahaika]]

==Mythology==
[[Image:Maoritattoo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A man holding a tao]]It is said weapons including the taiaha and patu were handed down by [[Tāne]], god of the forest and  [[Tū]], god of war, the two sons of [[Rangi and Papa|Rangi-nui and Papatūānuku]]. The Whare-tū-taua (House of war) is a term which covers the basics of educating young ''toa'' (warriors) in the arts of war.

==Introduction==
According to ''The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Zoroastrianism'' (2015), it was originally a feast honoring the Zoroastrian ''[[yazata]]'' [[Mithra]].&lt;ref name="John Wiley &amp; Sons"/&gt; By the [[4th century BC]]E, it was observed as one of the name-day feasts, a form it retains in today. Still, in a predominantly Muslim [[Iran]], it is one of the two pre-Islamic festivals that continue to be celebrated by the public at large: Mehrgān, dedicated to Mithra (modern ''Mehr''), and [[Tirgan]], dedicated to [[Tishtrya]] (modern ''Tir'').

Name-day feasts are festivals celebrated on the day of the year when the day-name and month-name dedicated to a particular angel or virtue intersect. The Mehr day in the Mehr month corresponded to the day farmers harvested their crops. They thus also celebrated the fact God had given them food to survive the coming cold months.

Irrespective of which calendar is observed, Mehrgān falls on the 196th day of the calendar year. For details on how this date is calculated, see [[#Basis for the date|basis for the date]], below. For calendars that have March 21 as [[Nowruz]] or New Year's Day (i.e. in the ''Fasili'' and ''Bastani'' variants of the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] as well as in the [[Iranian calendars|Iranian civil calendar]]), Mehrgān falls on October 2. For the ''Shahanshahi'' variant of the Zoroastrian calendar, which in 2006–2007 has New Year's Day on August 20, Mehrgān fell on March 3 of the following Gregorian year. For the ''Kadmi'' variant, which has New Year's Day 30 days earlier, Mehrgān falls on February 1.

In [[al-Biruni]]'s eleventh-century ''Book of Instructions in the Elements of the Art of Astrology'' (233), the astronomer observed that "some people have given the preference to Mihragān [over Nowruz, i.e. New Year's day/Spring Equinox] by as much as they prefer autumn to spring."&lt;ref name="CHI"&gt;{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|chapter=Iranian festivals|title=The Cambridge History of Iran|volume=3.2|editor-last=Yarshater|editor-first=Ehsan|year=1983|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=&lt;!--792-818--&gt;801–801}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Biruni also does for the other festival days he mentions, he reiterates a local anecdotal association for his description of Mehrgan (''ha al-mirjan'' in the author's Arabic parlance) with a fragment of a tale from Iranian folklore: On this day, [[Fereydun]] vanquished the evil [[Zahhak]] and confined him to [[Mount Damavand]]. This fragment of the legend is part of a greater cycle that ties Mehrgan with Nowruz; Dahak vanquished [[Jamshid]] (who the legends have as the one establishing Nowruz or New Year's Day), and Fereydun vanquishes Dahak, so restoring the balance. The association of Mehrgan with the polarity of spring/autumn, sowing/harvest and the birth/rebirth cycle did not escape Biruni either, for as he noted, "they consider Mihragān as a sign of resurrection and the end of the world, because at Mihragān that which grows reaches perfection."&lt;ref name="CHI" /&gt;

==In ancient times==
[[File:Mehregan Table in UCTI University of Malaysia 2011.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Mehregan Table Persian Festival of Autumn in [[UCTI]] University of Malaysia by Persian Students, 2011.]]
Mehrgān was celebrated in an extravagant style at [[Persepolis]]. Not only was it the time for harvest, but it was also the time when the taxes were collected. Visitors from different parts of the [[Persian Empire]] brought gifts for the king all contributing to a lively festival.

During pre-Islamic and early Islamic Iran, Mehrgān was celebrated with the same magnificence and pageantry as [[Nowruz]]. It was customary for people to send or give their king, and each other, gifts. Rich people usually gave gold and silver coins, heroes and warriors gave horses while others gave gifts according to their financial power and ability, even as simple as an apple. Those fortunate enough would help the poor with gifts.

Gifts to the royal court of over ten thousand gold coins were registered. If the gift-giver needed money at a later time, the court would then return twice the gift amount. Kings gave two audiences a year: one audience at [[Nowruz]] and other at Mehregān. During the Mehregān celebrations, the king wore a fur robe and gave away all his summer clothes.

After the [[Ilkhanate|Mongol invasion of Iran]], the feast celebration of Mehrgān lost its popularity. Zoroastrians of [[Yazd]] and [[Kerman|Kermān]] continued to celebrate Mehrgān in an extravagant way.

==In the present-day==
For this celebration, the participants wear new clothes and set a decorative, colorful table. The sides of the tablecloth are decorated with dry [[marjoram]]. A copy of the [[Khordeh Avesta]] ("little Avesta"), a mirror and a ''sormeh-dan'' (a traditional eyeliner or [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]]) are placed on the table together with rosewater, sweets, flowers, vegetables and fruits, especially pomegranates and apples, and nuts such as almonds or pistachios. A few silver coins and lotus seeds are placed in a dish of water scented with marjoram extract.

A burner is also part of the table setting for ''kondor''/''loban'' ([[frankincense]]) and ''espand'' (seeds of ''[[Peganum harmala]]'', Syrian rue) to be thrown on the flames.

At lunch time when the ceremony begins, everyone in the family stands in front of the mirror to pray. [[Sharbat]] is drunk and then—as a good omen—''sormeh'' is applied around the eyes. Handfuls of wild marjoram, lotus and sugar plum seeds are thrown over one another's heads while they embrace one another.

In 1960s the Postal Service in [[Tehran]] issued a series of stamps to commemorate Mehrgan Festival.

==Basis for the date==
As noted above, Mehrgān is a name-day feast. These name-day feasts are festivals celebrated on the day of the year when the day-name and month-name dedicated to a particular angel or virtue intersect. Indeed, Zoroastrian Persians before Islam had 30-days months, which means that each day in a month had a different name, with 12 of the days also being names of the 12 months. The day whose name corresponded to the name of the month was celebrated. It was a celebration of life, seasons changing, God, and joy. In Zoroastrianism, happiness is very important and is considered as a holy virtue that must be attracted. Thus, this religion has always had many feasts and celebrations.

What that day corresponds to in another calendar is subject to which variant of the Zoroastrian calendar is followed:
*The ''Fasili'' and ''Bastani'' variants of the religious calendar adhere to [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] intercalation (leap-day) rules, and therefore Mehregān is celebrated on a day that is fixed in relation to the Gregorian calendar. Mehrgān is then always on October 8.
*The ''Shahanshahi'' and ''Kadmi'' variants of the religious calendar do not intercalate at all, with the result that over the last 14 centuries, Mehrgān has fallen behind and is now either 7th (''Shahenshahi'') or 8th (''Kadmi'') months before the same date in the ''Fasili'' and ''Bastani'' variants.

The ''Bastani'' calendar is used primarily in [[Greater Iran]] and by Persians of the diaspora, while Zoroastrians of India (subject to calendrical faction) use one of the other three variants.

Non-Zoroastrian Iranians do not observe any variant of the Zoroastrian calendar, but instead use Iranian calendars. When introduced in 1925, the Zoroastrian festival days were pegged to the ''Bastani'' variant of the Zoroastrian calendar. The first six months of the civil calendar had 31 days each, while all Zoroastrian calendar months have 30 days each. So by the 7th month (Mehr) there is a difference of 6 days between the two. Thus, October 8, which in the ''Bastani''/''Fasili'' calendar is the 16th day of Mehr month, is in the Persian civil calendar the 10th day ([[Aban]]) of the same month.

The relationship between Mehregān and the various calendars is perhaps better understood relative to Nowruz. When (relative to another calendar) the first day of the year occurs is subject to interpretation, but independent of when it occurs, Mehregān is celebrated 195 days after that, that is on the 196th day of the year.

The '''Multiverse''', within [[DC Comics]] publications, is a "cosmic construct" collecting many of the fictional universes in which the published stories take place. The worlds in this multiverse share a space and fate in common, and its structure has changed several times in the history of DC Comics.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Wallace | first=Dan | contribution=Alternate Earths | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages=20–21 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=[[London]] | date=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Golden Age ===
The concept of a universe and a multiverse in which the fictional stories take place was loosely established during the Golden Age. With the publication of ''[[All-Star Comics]]'' #3 in 1940, the first crossover between characters occurred with the creation of the [[Justice Society of America]] (JSA), which presented the first superhero team with characters appearing in other publications (comic strips and anthology titles) to bring attention to less-known characters. This established the first shared "universe", as all these heroes now lived in the same world. Prior to this publication, characters from the different comic books seemingly existed in different worlds.

Later, ''Wonder Woman'' #59 (May 1953) presented DC Comics's first story depicting a parallel "mirror" world. [[Wonder Woman]] is transported to a twin Earth where she meets Tara Terruna who is exactly like her. Tara Terruna means "Wonder Woman" in the native language of that world. Wonder Woman describes this world as being a twin world existing alongside Earth with duplicates of everyone but with a different development. The concept of different versions of the world and its heroes was revisited in the pages of ''Wonder Woman'' a few times later.

=== Silver Age ===
Led by editor Julius Schwartz and writer Gardner Fox, DC Comics's super heroes were given a "reboot" with the publication of ''Showcase'' #4 in 1956, where a new version of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] made his first appearance. The success of this new Flash led the creation of new incarnations of the Golden Age characters who only shared the names and powers but had different secret identities, origins and stories. Later, new versions of other heroes, [[Superman]], [[Batman]] and Wonder Woman, were also restarted by retelling their origins but keeping their secret identities.
Gardner Fox, who worked before in the creation of the JSA, where other heroes met for the first time, created the story "[[Flash of Two Worlds]]" in ''The Flash'' #123, where Barry Allen, the new Flash, is transported to the Earth where the original Flash, Jay Garrick, existed. To Allen, Jay Garrick's world was a work of fiction as it was in the real world. This story not only presented the encounter of two worlds and the existence of the Multiverse for the first time, it also presented key features of the Multiverse: all the universes vibrate at a specific frequency which keeps them separated; these "barriers" could be trespassed by "tuning" to that vibration. Because people could also "tune-in" these worlds in dreams, some people wrote comic books with the stories from those worlds they dreamed, which explained why Barry Allen knew about Jay Garrick as a fictional character.

The success of this story led to the first team crossover between the new [[Justice League of America]] (JLA) and the Golden Age JSA, in the stories '''"Crisis on Earth-One"''' (''Justice League of America'' #21) and '''"Crisis on Earth-Two"''' (''Justice League of America'' #22). This story arc started the tradition of a yearly crossover between the JLA and the JSA, and established firmly the concept of a Multiverse and the designation of names, Earth-One being the JLA reality and Earth-Two the JSA reality. The success of these crossovers spawned publications telling the further stories of the Golden Age heroes in the present day parting from many of the stories told, thus, establishing a more defined continuity for every Universe.

This concept of parallel Earths with differences in locations, persons and historical events became a very important ingredient within DC Comics' publications. It helped (among other things) to explain continuity errors, to retell and [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]] stories, and to incorporate foreign elements that could actively interact with everything else and allow them to have an "existence". Continuity flaws between the established Earth-Two and several stories from the Golden Age were given separate Earths. "Imaginary" stories and some time divergences of Earth-One were given also separate realities (such as Earth-B and Earth-A). In addition to the stories appearing mainly in the pages of ''JLA'' that created new Earths, the acquisition of other comic book companies and characters by DC Comics incorporated these new properties as Earths in the Multiverse which would interact several times with the "main" Earths, One and Two; two of the most notable being Earth-S for the [[Fawcett Comics]] characters, and Earth-X for the Quality Comics characters. By the 1970s, everything that was published or related officially to DC Comics' titles could become part of the Multiverse, although much of it remained largely uncatalogued.

The names of the worlds were usually in the format ''Earth, hyphen, spelled numeral/letter/name''. In the case of worlds with numerals, the "rule" of spelling the number was not always followed, even within the pages of the same issue.

=== ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
As the 50th anniversary of DC Comics drew near, major events were proposed for the celebration: an encyclopedia (''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe]]'') and a crossover of the ages, characters, and worlds appearing in DC's comics. As told in the letter section of ''[[Crisis On Infinite Earths]]'' #1, as the research started in the late 1970s, it became evident that there were many flaws in continuity. The way used to circumvent some of these errors was the "Multiple Earths", which also showed a chaotic nature that brought even more continuity problems that were not easily explained or were simply left unexplained. Examples of this included: 1) Black Canary of Earth-One being the daughter of the original Black Canary of WWII even though the original Black Canary was a resident of Earth-Two, and 2) the existence of Golden Age comic books on Earth-One and the people not noticing that some of the characters in those comic books existed in "real-life". In addition, many universes had multiple alternate timelines, such as Kamandi and the Legion of Super-Heroes, both being from Earth-One.

Writer [[Marv Wolfman]] took this crossover event as an opportunity to reform all the fictional universe of DC Comics to avoid further continuity errors and update the DC characters to modern times. The whole Multiverse is destroyed except for five Earths (Silver Age Earth-One, Golden Age Earth-Two, Charlton Comics' Earth-Four, Fawcett Comics' Earth-S and Quality Comics' Freedom Fighters' Earth-X). Later, the universe is recreated as one single universe from those five.

The ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'' (2015) crossover event officially retconned the events of ''Crisis'' after heroes in that series went back in time to prevent the collapse of the Multiverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/24643-major-spoilers-dc-s-convergence-concludes-undoes-crisis.html|title=MAJOR SPOILERS: DC's CONVERGENCE Concludes, Undoes [Redacted]|author=|date=|website=newsarama.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern Age ===

==== DC Comics ====
After the conclusion of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', the concept of a single Universe containing most elements of the "surviving Earths" was established and heavily enforced to avoid the continuity problems of the Multiverse. However, alternate realities that affected the new DC Universe appeared very quickly. In ''Superman'' Vol. 2 #8, a Universe inside the Universe was revealed to have been created to preserve the Legion of Super Heroes' 30th century in New Earth. This world was used to allow [[crossover (comics)|crossovers]] with certain characters of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] and recreate characters that otherwise could not exist in the new continuity (such as [[Kryptonian]]s, as in the New Earth [[Superman]] was the only survivor of Krypton). Alternate timelines were also used, the most notable event being ''[[Armageddon 2001]]'' in 1991. An [[Antimatter]] Universe existed as well, which had some "reversed" events in a similar way as the former Earth-Three. The Earth within this Universe was called "Earth 2". In addition, there was a Limbo, where some heroes and characters that could not be brought back to "existence" after the Crisis on Infinite Earths lived outside the Universe.

An important rule in the new DC Universe was that there could only be one timeline, so any change caused by time travelers caused the destruction of their timelines of origin. Changes in the past were often "fixed" or have to comply with the present to prevent continuity errors.

Nonetheless, continuity errors appeared. The retold origin of [[Hawkman]] presented errors regarding the existence of the Golden Age version ([[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter Hall]]) and the Silver Age version ([[Katar Hol]]) in the same continuity without a good explanation. The interaction of "possible timelines" also created continuity holes. This led to a new crisis to address the problem: the [[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]. The resulting universe had a slightly re-written story with no continuity errors even though it was acknowledged that reality-shattering events did happen (including the Crisis on Infinite Earths). This Universe kept the concept of one universe, one timeline. Such timeline was "mapped" from beginning to present (1994) at the back cover of ''Zero Hour'' #0, that also included certain key dates in the future.

The need to publish stories outside the strict DC Universe continuity led to the creation of certain DC [[Imprint (trade name)|imprints]]. Stories that set DC characters in different situations after the Crisis on Infinite Earths, were published by DC Comics under the '''[[Elseworlds]]''' imprint. None of these stories were ever intended to be included in the "real" continuity of the DC Universe.

Certain characters were reinvented in a mature context and were published under the '''[[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]]''' imprint. Most of the times, the characters depicted within the Vertigo imprint had no relation to the original DC Universe's versions, nor did the events have influence over the new Universe.

Later, under a special publishing deal with [[Milestone Media]], DC Comics published a new series of comic books that told the stories of the heroes living in [[Dakota City (comics)|Dakota City]], formed mostly by African-American superheroes and other minorities. These characters lived in a universe separated from the DC Universe (known as the Dakotaverse or Milestone Universe). The event known as  ''[[Worlds Collide (comics)|Worlds Collide]]'' presented one of the first modern intercompany crossovers within the established continuity of the Universes instead of being "imaginary" and showed that there could be other universes or even multiverses outside the new DC Universe.

In a similar way to ''[[Worlds Collide (comics)|Worlds Collide]]'', the crossover event ''[[DC vs. Marvel]]'' showed another in-continuity crossover with another reality completely separated from the DC Universe and that has a Multiverse of its own: the universe of Earth-616 of the Marvel Multiverse.

The universes were rarely referred to with specific names within the stories but were named in the "Real World" (both officially and unofficially) using the name of the editorial, imprint or even an element in particular. While in the comic books the concept of a "real" Multiverse was avoided, the Multiverse played an important role in cartoon series and live-action shows (see [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Other versions|Other versions]]).

In summary, from 1986 to 1999, everything not happening in the "mainstream" continuity appearing in DC comics was either an "apocryphal" story or happened in a completely different and separate reality/universe/multiverse.

In 1999, the unexpected and overwhelming success of Elseworlds's ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' and other stories, led to the creation of the concept known as [[Hypertime]] in order to publish crossovers with those characters and the mainstream continuity. This structure gave "existence" to alternate timelines, stories in Elseworlds, appearances in other media and any other appearance of DC characters in the past. The main timeline or "Central Timeline" was like a river and all of the alternate stories were branches of it. Hypertime was similar to the former Multiverse as it allowed each and every reality ever published to co-exist and interact as most branches tend to return to the original stream (explaining some retcons as well as crossovers). However, all realities existed within only one Universe.

==== WildStorm ====
Originally, the stories appearing in WildStorm Productions' comic books occurred in a Universe that was part of the [[Image Comics|Image Universe]] along with other characters appearing in Image Comics publications. It was separated from it during the event called '''''Shattered Image''''' consolidating the separate WildStorm Universe which had its own multiversal structure. After the purchase of WildStorm by DC Comics, crossovers occurred with the new DC Universe, which were still separated just like Milestone and Marvel.

=== 21st century ===

==== ''52'' ====
{{Main|52 (comics)}}

In 2005, a new universal crisis story arc was published as a way to update once more the super heroes of DC Comics, bring together other "realities" (namely, Milestone and Wildstorm) and bring back the Multiverse, this time with a limited number of Earths instead of infinite.

During the event ''Infinite Crisis'', the Universe was "splintered" and the original Multiverse was restored briefly, showing that the entire Hypertime and many other appearances of the DC characters were part of the original Multiverse, including [[Tangent Comics]] which were published 12 years after the Multiverse was no more. In the end of ''Infinite Crisis'', the multiverse is merged back as a New Earth with a new continuity with many stories re-written and many others from the Modern Age still happening.

In parallel, ''Captain Atom: Armageddon'' tells the story of how Captain Atom of the DC Universe causes the recreation of the Wildstorm Universe upon its destruction (and possibly its Multiverse as well). The recreated universe became part of the newly recreated DC Universe.

The aftermath of ''Infinite Crisis'' and ''Captain Atom: Armageddon'' (''52'', ''Countdown to Final Crisis'' and ''Final Crisis'') showed that a new Multiverse was created. The new Multiverse consisted of 52 positive matter universes, an Antimatter Universe and a Limbo. The main continuity still occurred in New Earth (also called Earth-0), Earths 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 resembled Earths One, Two, Three, Four, S, and X of the original Multiverse respectively. Earths 13 and 50 were Vertigo and the rebooted Wildstorm Universe, while Earth-17 became the world of a revived [[post-apocalypse]] [[Atomic Knights]] after a mid-80s [[World War III]] once more. Many important stories from the Elseworlds imprint were later also given their own alternate Earths within this new Multiverse.

In the miniseries, ''Milestone Forever'', in a similar fashion as ''Captain Atom: Armageddon'', the events that led to the end of the Dakotaverse and its integration to the new DC continuity are revealed. Most of the stories that were told in Milestone Comics publications now occurred in New Earth and the Dakotaverse ceased to exist as a separated Universe.

A naming convention was established and followed this time in the format ''Earth, hyphen, numeral'', from Earth-0 to Earth-51.

Even with a new Multiverse, not every published or related work had an "Earth" within the 52 and there were no in-continuity intercompany crossovers.

Taking advantage of the fact that many of these universes were mostly unchronicled or merely glimpsed and that ''Final Crisis'' also changed the Multiverse slightly, many stories featuring alternate worlds and their interactions were published, which led certain inconsistencies and retcons to appear, such as Earth-1 being originally a "mirror" of Earth-One and later being the reality of [[J. Michael Straczynski]]'s ''[[Superman: Earth One]]'' or Earth-16 being the home of an alternate Superman/[[Chris Kent (comics)|Christopher Kent]], the home of the ''[[Super-Sons]]'', and later the reality of the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' TV series. Also, some universes appearing in the new continuity were never given a proper place within the 52 Universe, such as Prime-Earth.

==== ''The New 52'' ====
{{Main|The New 52}}

The new restored universe with only 52 worlds opened myriad possibilities for new stories and crossovers with different versions of heroes interacting with the main versions of heroes as well as the stories resulting from the new integrated characters from Milestone and Wildstorm. However, it became chaotic in just five years. Many stories and situations of other Universes were not followed well. The number designations could be completely disregarded from story to story and some universes were recreated over and over. In addition, as most of the history of the Modern Age was still being the main continuity, younger readers could not follow the stories of the mainstream versions of the DC heroes, just as had happened prior to the original ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''.

In order to overcome these new problems, a new event was created to restart the DC Comics's Universe. In the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' miniseries (May–September 2011), the Flash alters the timeline of Earth-0 creating a ripple effect that affected several past events, Earth-13 (Vertigo Universe) and Earth-50 (new Wildstorm Universe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifanboy.com/articles/features/the-definitive-guide-to-the-dc-comics-reboot/|title=The Definitive Guide To The DC Comics Reboot|author=|date=|website=ifanboy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the end result of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', a new mainstream Earth is created from the former three, with a whole new history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/08/31/faq-dc-comics-new-52 The New 52 FAQ: Answering Your Questions about the Relaunched DC Universe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126043701/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/08/31/faq-dc-comics-new-52 |date=2012-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the stories have been retold anew but certain events of New Earth remain (such as Batgirl being crippled by the Joker). Since it was established after ''Infinite Crisis'' that if something ever happened to the main Universe, the whole Multiverse could be affected as well, a new Multiverse of 52 worlds was also recreated. This new Multiverse is called ''The New 52''.

This time, not all universes were revealed right away, only a couple were revealed in the first two years of ''The New 52''. In addition, in a similar fashion as the Elseworlds logo would appear in comics that did not occur in the "real" continuity, the logo ''THE NEW 52!'' would only appear in publications with stories occurring in the new continuity, while those taking place outside of this new continuity (such as ''Smallville: Season 11'' or the ''Batman Beyond'' universe) would not bear this distinction. At first it seemed that there was not going to be a naming convention for the Earths as it happened with the 52. The mainstream continuity was known as Prime Earth, although it was not a similar world to the real world as Earth-Prime was. [[J. Michael Straczynski]]'s re-envisioning of classic Batman and Superman stories was released as part of a series called ''Earth One''. In Grant Morrison's ''[[The Multiversity]]'' (2014–2015), the Earths are named in the same format as in the former 52 Multiverse (Earth-6, Earth-7, Earth-8 etc.) Morrison intended for ''[[The Multiversity]]'' to reveal remaining universes of The New 52 multiverse, and the underlying structure for the multiverse was revealed in a detailed map in the back of several comic books, for which an interactive online version is being maintained and updated on the DC Comics website. In addition, the sixth issue of ''The Multiversity'' constituted a 'guidebook' to the worlds of the current DC multiverse and was published in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;''Multiversity Guidebook'' (January 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Convergence'' and ''DC Rebirth'' ====
{{Main|Convergence (comics)}}

On October 2, 2011, Dan DiDio posted on his Facebook page that in The New 52, the three previous "crises" did not occur in this new continuity, but other events such as ''Zero Hour'' still happened, without ending in a crisis/reboot.&lt;ref&gt;Lichman, John (October 4, 2011) [http://www.ugo.com/the-goods/dc-new-52-timeline-so-far.html "DC New 52 Timeline So Far"]. UGO.&lt;/ref&gt; However, writers continued to make references to the crises, and the full history of the structure of the DC Multiverse, detailing previous crisis events, was given in [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[The Multiversity]]'' (2014–2015) limited series.

The ''Convergence'' (2015) crossover event later explored this concept within the DCU. This miniseries brought back several heroes from the ages of DC Comics that were obliterated by the crisis events. They were trapped by a godlike incarnation of [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] outside of time (or Vanishing Point as this "place" is called). At the end of the crossover, Brainiac sent these heroes back to their own timelines, and also successfully sent ''Zero Hour'' Hal Jordan, pre-''Flashpoint'' Superman and other heroes back to the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' so that the collapse of the Multiverse could be averted.

From July 2015 onwards, The New 52 marking ended with the continuation of several publications and new others that did not necessarily take place within ''The New 52'' multiverse. Advertised as ''DC YOU'' (a pun of DCU or DC Universe and the phrase "it's about you, the fans" appearing in the advertisements), DC now has an "open doors" policy to continuity, granting writers greater freedom to explore stories set outside the established New 52 Multiverse continuity, as well as to revisit other characters and concepts from DC's history as the conclusion of ''Convergence'' suggested that although the core 52 universe that now exists is the evolution of the multiverse, all the worlds still exist in some form. This was confirmed by ''Convergence'' writer Jeff King, as he stated that the reconstituted DC Multiverse is now infinite and there might be more than one Multiverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/2015/05/27/decoding-convergence-with-jeff-king-the-finale/|title=Decoding Convergence With Jeff King: The Finale|author=|date=|website=comicbook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' initiative returned the original Wally West to Earth from the Speed Force and reveals that time has been stolen from his friends' memories, and the Superman of the pre-''Flashpoint'' world, stranded in the new timeline following ''Convergence'', assumes the role of that Earth's Superman. In ''Action Comics'' #976, the pre-''Flashpoint'' and ''New 52'' Supermen's histories are merged. [[Peter J. Tomasi]] explains that "The events of ''Action'' #976 reset and reshape the entire Superman timeline. Where there had been two Superman, their realities have now been fused into one timeline with just one of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/superman-reborn-recap/|title=Everything Changed Forever!

== Fictional history, structure and worlds of the DC Multiverse ==
{{See also|List of DC Multiverse worlds}}

=== Infinite Multiverse ===
As told in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #7, the DC Universe was a single positive matter Universe until a scientist named Krona from the planet Oa altered the very moment of the creation of the Universe, causing it to split into countless similar universes and an antimatter universe. Oa, however, had no duplicates in the Multiverse but did have a twin in the antimatter universe: Qward. A satellite on each of these planets was created in the cataclysm and it was there where the embodiments of the Multiverse were born: the Monitor and the [[Anti-Monitor]]. The two battled to a standstill and eventually rendered one another comatose.

The Multiverse had countless&lt;ref&gt;Marv Wolfman, the writer of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', estimated that the original Multiverse had consisted of about 3,000 universes.&lt;/ref&gt; duplicates of planet Earth. Every Earth had a different history from one another but they always developed heroes and inspired heroic ages (which, according to Harbinger, it somehow made them a focal point among all the worlds in every universe). Some of the heroes of Earth knew about other Earths and their own counterparts and fought side by side on many occasions.

Later, a scientist from one universe named Kell Mossa (known initially only as [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]]) created another device that would allow him to attempt the same thing Krona had attempted before. His actions accidentally awakened the Anti-Monitor, who then devoured Pariah's entire universe (aside from Pariah himself) and began to do the same to other universes (Pariah originally believes that the opposite is true; that his experiment destroyed the universes, which awakened the Anti-Monitor, until the truth is revealed to him). The time period of Earth when this takes place or the name of this Earth are never revealed.

The Monitor is awakened by the destruction of the positive matter universes and starts a plan to save the Multiverse but his efforts, and later those of his protégé, Harbinger, with the help of the heroes of the Multiverse, only manage to save five universes. In a desperate effort to save all existence, heroes and villains unite in order to stop Krona from splitting the Universe and stop the Anti-Monitor from altering the moment of creation and make the Antimatter Universe the only one. They succeed in saving all existence but in the process, the Multiverse, its countless duplicate worlds and its history ceased to exist. The five universes that were saved were folded together into a single universe, placing all the heroes and villains into a single timeline. For example, Justice Society of Earth-Two instead became a team active in the 1940s that inspired the Justice League to form decades later. And in the event of any duplicate characters, the original Earth-One version would take precedence.

All the universes existed within the same space but had a unique vibration that kept them separated. Only by "tuning" to the specific frequency of a universe could a person leap to another Earth, as Barry Allen discovered as he tried to perform a disappearing act by vibrating his molecules at super speed (''Flash'' #123). The "speedster" later developed a machine called the "Cosmic Treadmill", which, when it was used by people who controlled the [[Speed Force]], it allowed the users to trespass the "vibrational barriers". Magic and cosmic incidents also made many people to travel to other universes.

Every universe could have its own dimensions, such as the Fifth Dimension (where Mr. Mxyztplk (Earth-Two), Mr. Mxyzptlk and Bat-Mite (both Earth-One) came from), alternate timelines (Kamandi and the 30th Century of Earth-One) and realms (Hell, Heaven, Gemworld, etc.). In addition to the unique Antimatter Universe, the dimension of the New Gods (the Fourth World) was also believed unique, although there is evidence that there could have been alternate versions of them (as those appearing in Earth-17 and Earth-Crossover).

Even though the interaction between multiple Earths was common in the 20th century with relative safety and ease, most of the population of Earth was unaware of the Multiverse until the Crisis on Infinite Earths.

The following is a short list of the most notable universes in the Multiverse.

=== DC Universe and Megaverse ===
{{Main|DC Universe}}

15 billion years ago, a single universe with a single timestream was created. 4.4 billion years ago, Krona, the renegade Maltusian (a race of highly evolved beings) creates the Antimatter Universe and releases entropy in the universe by linking the beginning and the end of the timeline in his attempts to reveal the secrets of the creation of the universe.

In this single universe, the timeline was destroyed in the early 1990s by Hal Jordan (possessed by Parallax) and created a slightly changed timeline (''Zero Hour'', 1994). It was later revealed that this ''Central Timeline'' was like a river with branches. These branches were like different realities, the history of Earth was different in every branch and everything could be possible in them. They could affect the Central Timeline as they return to the mainstream and the heroes could encounter with different versions of themselves. However, they were somewhat ephemeral as the Central Timeline is the only one that could prevail (''The Kingdom'', 1999).

After ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', there was no place for alternate realities, although they could exist in the form of ephemeral timelines (Hypertime), dimensions (such as the fifth dimension or the Fourth World) or universes inside the Universe (such as the Legion of Super-Heroes' pocket universe or the Amalgam Universe).

However, there was contact with realities that existed outside the Universe such as those from Marvel, Milestone and Wildstorm. The collection of universes, multiverses and others that are unrelated, is most of the time called the Megaverse. Some{{Who|date=October 2015}} also call it the Omniverse, but tend to include the Real World when using this denomination.

The contact of these worlds usually brought cataclysms, the one being the most common, amalgamation. Traveling between these realities was extremely hard, only two characters were capable of doing so with natural abilities: Rift, who existed in both the DC and Milestone Universes, and Access, who had the task of keeping the DC and Marvel Universes separated to prevent amalgamation.

Most of the time, these events were either forgotten (as shown in the ''Unlimited Access'' miniseries as Access has the power to annul or restore the memories of heroes) or believed to be "dreams" (as shown in ''DC/Milestone: Worlds Collide'' and ''DC/Wildstorm: Dreamwar''), which in the end left few traces of the events in the respective continuities.

The Wildstorm Universe was part of a larger multiverse but was separated after a multiversal cataclysm, forming a multiverse of its own (''Shattered Image''). Organizations known as [[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]] and the Authority were capable of traveling across the Multiverse and were also able to map it. Its structure was described as a web of 196,833 universes arranged in a pattern resembling a [[snowflake]], each universe separated from its neighbors by a medium called the [[Bleed (comics)|Bleed]]. The Bleed prevented the Universes from colliding and was inhabited by "fauna" that despised all different Earths.

=== ''52'' ===
Alexander Luthor Jr. of Earth-Three and Superboy of Earth-Prime grew tired of their exile. After successfully escaping their prison, they seek to restore their worlds and search for a perfect new world, as they believe the happenings at New Earth after the Crisis make it a flawed reality. The whole Multiverse is restored, but with great instability that could cause the end of all existence (''Infinite Crisis''). Parallel to these events, Captain Atom arrives in a different multiverse, jeopardizing its very existence. Void destroys the now-corrupted universe in order to recreate it (''Captain Atom: Armageddon'').

The heroes of Earth manage to merge back the Multiverse into a single universe, but it could not hold so much energy. 52 identical worlds are created to liberate such energy. Mister Mind, finally in his ultimate form, has the power to devour parts of the time continuum, literally eating parts of the Earths' history and creating major differences between each other (''[[52 (comics)|52]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504180243/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/004448945.cfm|title=Wizard Entertainment|author=|date=4 May 2007|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="countdownarena"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=124768 |title=WW: Chicago '07: Dan DiDio on 'Countdown: Arena' |work=[[Newsarama]] |accessdate=February 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011131246/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=124768 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Universe where the city of Dakota existed, a man known as Dharma foresaw the final demise of Earth and searched for a way to avert it. His very efforts were responsible for the apocalypse he tried to prevent. He managed to salvage the remains of his Earth by merging them to the main Earth of the new Multiverse that was reformed after the death of the New Gods (''Milestone Forever'', ''Final Crisis'').

This Multiverse consisted of only 52 worlds, 51 resting upon Earth-0. According to Rip Hunter in ''52 #52'', every universe occupied the same space, each on a different vibrational plane (as it was in the original Multiverse). However, it was stated later that the universes were also separated by a fluid known as the Bleed (just like in the former Wildstorm Universe). The Bleed is interconnected to the Source Wall (which separates existence from the force that created it or "the Source") and the Multiversal Nexus, where the 52 Monitors watched over the Multiverse and had the task of avoiding contacts between the universes that could cause cataclysms. If Earth-0 should be destroyed, it would cause a chain reaction, destroying the rest of the 51 universes and leaving the opposite Antimatter Universe solely in existence. Each of the alternate universes have their own parallel dimensions, divergent timelines, microverses, etc., branching off them.&lt;ref name="Baltimore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=128569 |title=Baltimore Comic-Con '07: DC Nation Panel Report |work=Newsarama |accessdate=February 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911033901/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=128569 |archivedate=September 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Monitors originated in a world called Nil and were a sort of descendants of the original Monitor, who was created by Overvoid, a limitless intelligence who investigated the Multiverse at the beginning of time. Nix Uotan, the Monitor of Earth-51 erased the Monitors, as they self-proclaimed themselves the judges of what happened in the worlds of the Multiverse.

=== ''The New 52'' ===
The Flash wakes up in an altered timeline. As he tries to find the cause, he discovers that he was responsible for the alteration and attempts to fix it. In doing so, it is revealed that the timelines of Earth-0, Earth-13 and Earth-50 were originally one, but were splintered. The result is a new timeline formed by those three and along with it came a new history for the other 52 worlds within the Multiverse (''Flashpoint'', 2011). It is later revealed that, in actuality, the current timeline was created when a mysterious being (implied to be Doctor Manhattan from ''Watchmen'') entered the Multiverse while the timeline was resetting due to Barry Allen preventing the Flashpoint event and extracted ten years from continuity (''DC Universe: Rebirth'', 2016)

Years later, the Harbinger Program at the House of Heroes gathers several superheroes of the "Orrery of Worlds" to fight against a force known as the "Gentry" who has already decimated Earth-7 and threatens the rest of the worlds of the Multiverse. As the story unfolds, Earths within the Orrery are visited and reveal the new nature of them after the Flashpoint event. Also, mysterious comic books published by DC and Major Comics appear and are believed to be cursed or to be messages from parallel Earths (''[[The Multiversity]]'' (2014)).

Several stories and even the structure of the entire Multiverse have been retold after the events of ''Flashpoint''. As it has been revealed so far, most of the 52 worlds suffered drastic changes such as Earth-2 which is now a reboot in the present day of the heroes that formed the Justice Society or Earth-3 which reverted to be the opposite of the main Earth (Earth-0 in this case), instead of the opposite of Earth-Two. Others retain most of what they were in the 52 multiverse such as Earth-5, Earth-10, or Earth-23. In addition, seven Earths remain undisclosed in composition or purpose, other than their creation by the Monitors for unknown reasons-Earths 14, 24, 25, 27, 28, 46 and 49.

The Monitors are now described as a race of countless members and only 52 remained after the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' event, suggesting that there were Monitors for every world in the original Multiverse instead of just one. Several elements that have appeared across the history to what now is DC Comics have also been actively incorporated in the new structure, such as the Source Wall (''The New Gods''), the Bleed (Wildstorm's ''The Authority''), the Speed Force and the vibrational barriers (''The Flash'') and the Rock of Eternity (''Shazam!'').

This new Multiverse has a sphere-like structure with several levels (or vibrational realms) as described in the map''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.dcentertainment.com/sites/default/files/Multiversity_Map_2400_53ee6b4c22d9a9.11031355.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612031510/http://media.dcentertainment.com/sites/default/files/Multiversity_Map_2400_53ee6b4c22d9a9.11031355.jpg |archivedate=2015-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''The Source Wall''': the limit of existence, beyond lies the ''Source'' and the ''Unknowable''. The ''Overvoid'' is shown in the map to exist outside it as well.
*'''The Monitor Sphere''': the origin of the ''Monitors'', a race who preserves and studies the universes.

=== Multi-Multiverse ===
An infinitely powerful and god-like version of [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] abducted multiple superheroes and their core cities from various alternate Earths and eras of the Multiverse and pitted them against one another. Because of the heroes' efforts for the survival of reality during this event, the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' and ''Zero Hour'' were averted and there is once more an infinite Multiverse beyond the core 52 universes which have made up the local Multiverse since ''Infinite Crisis'' and ''Flashpoint''. The original Multiverse coexists along with the collapsed Earth, the core 52 worlds, and all other versions of the Multiverse that have ever existed.&lt;ref&gt;''Convergence'' #8 (May 2015): DC Comics: New York&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dark Multiverse ===
In the ''[[Dark Nights: Metal]]'' storyline, it is revealed that each reality of the Multiverse has a negative counterpart created by the fears of a universe's people. These Dark Universes are explained to be temporary realities, which motivate the Dark Knights to invade the Multiverse so that they can save their dying realities. Forthcoming "Dark Multiverse" stories will revisit this realm, with mutated versions of [[Superman]], [[Jimmy Olsen]] and [[Lois Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.criticalhit.net/comics-toys/dc-just-getting-started-dark-multiverse-nightmarish-silver-age-designs-revealed-sideways/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other versions ==

=== ''Super Friends'' ===
{{Main|Super Friends}}

In the animated television series ''Super Friends'', the superhero team has encounters with other universes, including the world of Qward. In the episode "Universe of Evil", a freak accident causes [[Superman]] to switch places with his evil counterpart.

=== DC animated universe ===
{{Main|DC animated universe}}
The DC animated universe (DCAU) has depicted the Multiverse many times. Several characters from the main DCAU have visited parallel universes that were similar to the DCAU.

* In the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "Brave New Metropolis", [[Lois Lane]] fell into a parallel Earth where she had died in the car bombing orchestrated by Intergang. As a result, Superman had nothing to keep his morality from becoming corrupted. A much more serious Superman teamed with [[Lex Luthor]] and took over [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], turning it into a fascist police-state where the Daily Planet and S.T.A.R. Labs were shut down and a rebellion, which Jimmy Olsen is a part of, was started, though Superman was unaware of what Lex Luthor was doing with Metropolis until Lois showed him the truth, which was enough for Superman to turn against Luthor.
* In the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Legends", several members of the League were accidentally sent to a parallel universe where [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]]'s comic book idols, a [[pastiche]] of the [[Justice Society of America]] named the [[Justice Guild of America]], live. Justice Guild member Tom Turbine hypothesized that there are an infinite number of parallel dimensions.
* In the ''Justice League'' episode "A Better World", the Justice League were held captive by their authoritarian counterparts from another universe, the "[[Justice Lords]]". In this universe, Lex Luthor had risen to the U.S. Presidency and had started a war which had killed the Flash, sparking the Lords' takeover of the world, starting with this Superman killing President Luthor. In this world, the Justice Lords labotomized their former enemies, leaving them as harmless workers at Arkham. Later in the series, the regular Lex Luthor ran for President solely to enrage Superman for his amusement.
* In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Question Authority", the [[Question (comics)|Question]] is surfing through [[Project Cadmus|Cadmus]]'s files on a computer. One of the files is titled "Multiverse" and another file shows footage from the episode "A Better World" where the alternate Superman murders Lex Luthor. Ironically, after viewing files on the Justice Lords, he initially believes that instead of looking at an alternate universe, he is looking at the future of the universe in which the League lives. The exact means by how Cadmus came into possession of footage from the death of President Luthor seen in "A Better World" remains unknown.

=== ''Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman'' ===
{{Main|Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman}}

In ''Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman'', the show's primary protagonists, Lois Lane and [[Clark Kent]], encountered an alternative version Clark Kent from a parallel universe in the episodes "Tempus, Anyone?" and "Lois &amp; Clarks". In the episode "Tempus, Anyone?", the dimension included these differences:

* Clark Kent had not assumed the identity of Superman and was engaged to [[Lana Lang]] (prior to the events of "Tempus, Anyone?").
* Lois Lane had been lost on assignment in the Congo and presumed dead since 1993 (prior to the events of "Tempus, Anyone?" and "Lois &amp; Clarks").
* [[Jonathan and Martha Kent]] died when Clark was a child.
* [[Jimmy Olsen]] owns the [[Daily Planet]] and is also [[Perry White]]'s campaign manager for his mayoral election.
* Both [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Charlton Heston]] were elected as [[President of the United States of America]] (not to mention Elvis being alive and well).

The primary version of Lois, who was abducted by the villain Tempus and taken to this dimension, helped the alternate Clark become Superman, only to have Tempus expose his secret identity to the world on television. Despite Clark's alien origin, the world embraces him as their champion.

Later in the episode "Lois &amp; Clarks", the alternate Clark visits the primary ''L&amp;C'' dimension to aid Lois in stopping Tempus while the Clark Kent of her world is trapped in a time vortex. After Tempus' defeat, it is implied that the alternate Clark would travel to the past with [[H.G. Wells]] and take his reality's Lois Lane to his own time thus, under a [[predestination paradox]], explaining her disappearance.

=== Amalgam Comics ===
{{Main|Amalgam Comics}}

* Some issues in the two series from April 1996 and June 1997 (such as ''Spider-Boy Team-Up'' #1) state that a Crisis event known as the Secret Crisis of the Infinity Hour occurred and was related to alternate realities and timelines. The event is an amalgam of four major DC and Marvel crossover events (''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'', ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', ''The Infinity Gauntlet'' and ''Zero Hour: Crisis in Time'').
* In ''Challengers of the Fantastic'' #1, Reed "Prof" Richards is seen watching the parallel Universe-Two. It is hinted that this universe is an amalgam of DC's Earth-Two and Marvel's New Universe.
* ''Unlimited Access'' #4 shows glimpses of many amalgamated universes.
* The fictional letters in the letter sections of the April 1996 Amalgam Comics issues hint to an Amalgam Prime Earth, where the editor Stan Schwartz (an amalgam of Stan Lee and Julie Schwartz) and the film company Fox Bros. (an amalgam of 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros.) both exist.

=== ''Planetary'' ===
{{Main|Planetary (comics)}}

The [[WildStorm]] comic book series ''Planetary'' also introduced the concept of a multiverse, drawing upon the mathematical concept known as the [[Monster group]] for inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://warren-ellis.livejournal.com/2678.html | title =Mar. 27th, 2005 | accessdate =2006-11-10 | author =Warren Ellis | authorlink =Warren Ellis | date =2005-03-27 | work =Warren Ellis' Live Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multiverse is described as "a theoretical snowflake existing in 196,833 dimensional space",&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer =Warren Ellis  | Artist =John Cassaday | Title =Planetary | Issue =#2  | Date = April, 1999 | Publisher = DC Comics }}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the visualization method used by some mathematicians when describing the Monster group.

=== ''Smallville'' ===
{{Main|Smallville}}
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION FOR THIS SECTION REQUIRES INFORMATION FROM THE FOLLOWING STORYLINES: ALIEN, LANTERN, CHAOS AND CONTINUITY. REFERENCES WILL BE NECESSARY.--&gt;

The live-action television series ''Smallville'' also featured the Multiverse concept. In the season 5 episode "Lexmas", Lex Luthor visits an alternate timeline where Lionel cuts Lex out of the family fortune while Lex is married to Lana and has a son named Alexander. Clark Kent is a reporter with the Daily Planet, Chloe is publishing a book exposing LuthorCorp with Lex's help, and Jonathan Kent is a state senator.

In the season 7 episode "Apocalypse," Clark is taken to an alternate timeline where his counterpart had not arrived in Smallville and is killed by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. In that dimension, Clark Kent encounters another version of himself who is a human biological son of Martha and Jonathan and never met Lana Lang (who is a cheerleader with a different group of friends). Also in this dimension, Chloe Sullivan is engaged, Lana Lang is a married woman living in Paris, Sheriff Nancy Adams left Smallville and works as a member of the government, and Lex Luthor became President of the United States. While this dimension's Earth is destroyed by President Luthor, Clark travels back in time and sends his infant self to Earth, thus restoring his timeline.

In the season 10 episode "Luthor", Clark Kent travels to an alternate universe dubbed Earth-2 with the help of a Kryptonian mirror box. There, Lionel Luthor is his adopted father instead of Jonathan Kent. Clark is a bloodthirsty tyrant whose persona is [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]]. He has a relationship with his adopted sister, Tess. Clark Luthor killed his adoptive brother Lex. When Clark Kent travels to the alternate earth, his counterpart, Clark Luthor, travels to his. Lois Lane is engaged to [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen]], who bought land in Smallville for its kryptonite. Lionel lures Clark into Oliver's kryponite trap and beats him. With the help of Oliver (who closes the kryponite portal), Clark uses the mirror box and returns to his world. Unbeknownst to him, Lionel comes with him.

Earth-2 is featured again later in the season in the episode "Kent", as Clark Luthor returns to his counterpart's world once more, and Clark Kent meets Earth-2's Jonathan Kent.  After Clark Kent interacts with his deceased adoptive father's counterpart, he returns to his own world and lures Clark Luthor to the Fortress of Solitude, where he sends his counterpart back to his world.

In the fourth issue of the television series' comic book continuation ''Smallville Season 11'', an alternative version of [[Chloe Sullivan]] from Earth-2 arrives to Clark Kent's world and reveals that her universe is destroyed before her death.&lt;ref&gt;''Smallville Season 11'' vol. 1 #4 (August 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  In issue #11, it is reveals that the Monitors are responsible for Earth-2's destruction.&lt;ref&gt;''Smallville Season 11'' vol. 1 #10 (February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Across this multiverse, there are other Earths featured in the series including:

*; Earth-9: This Earth was destroyed when it was torn asunder by collision with Earth-37, toppling into one another, because of a Bleed quake caused by a Monitor who did not follow the protocol.
*; Earth-13: This Earth was a parallel universe that co-existed as one with the Earth of the main Smallville universe. Not much is known about this universe as it was never shown, only merely mentioned. Its main feature was that its version of Clark Kent was a normal human and a wannabe hero, rather than a Kryptonian with superpowers, and Bruce Wayne, instead of being a superhero, is actually a psychopathic killer. Like many other universes, this Earth was also decimated. Earth-13 was destroyed when Earths-9 and -37 were torn asunder by collision, toppling into one another and shattering reality on Earth-13, because of a Bleed quake caused by a Monitor who did not follow the protocol. Its version of Clark managed to travel to the main Earth of Smallville. Unfortunately, he was followed by Bruce and he was killed by him there. Bruce Wayne remains the last survivor of his Earth, as he is held prisoner on Mars.
*; Earth-37: This Earth was destroyed when it was torn asunder by collision with Earth-9, toppling into one another, because of a Bleed quake caused by a Monitor who did not follow the protocol.
*; Earth-Majestic: This Earth is a parallel universe that co-exists as one with the Earth of the main Smallville universe. It is referred to as Earth-Majestic and its designation is unknown. It derives this name from its greatest superhero Mister Majestic, the alternate version of Superman. This Earth is the latest target of the Monitors, as they have already started the process to decimate it. It was later destroyed like the other Earths before it with the consciousness of Jor-El being the last survivor of this universe.
*; Earth-Omega: This Earth is a parallel universe that co-exists as one with the Earth of the main Smallville universe. It is referred to as Earth "Omega" and its designation is unknown. It derives this name from the Omega symbol, which is used by Darkseid. This Earth was attacked and seized by Apokolips and the two planets have collided with each other. Among the ruins are several fallen ships that belonged to the Monitors, wrecked Manhunters and skeletons of dead people. This Earth has not been destroyed entirely yet, because when the Monitors arrived there, Darkseid had already conquered that world. A catastrophic battle followed between the two parts, destroying almost everything around them. However, the Monitors, who, even though they suffered many casualties, succeeded in breaking Darkseid. After Superman made a deal with Darkseid, he gave him the crystal shard that contains the presence of Jor-El from Earth-Majestic. Darkseid threw the shard into the distance and a Fortress of Solitude formed, with Darkseid saying it could be a new beginning, a "'''New Genesis'''."

=== ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' ===
{{Main|Batman: The Brave and the Bold}}

In ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'', a kind of "multiverse" is referenced in the episodes "Deep Cover for Batman!" and "Game Over for Owlman!", which feature several references to alternate incarnations of DC Comics heroes and villains, including the [[Batman]] and the [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]]. The Multiverse is briefly revisited in "Night of the Batmen!", with a large group of Batmen gathered from across various Earths coming together to help an injured Bruce Wayne protect Gotham. The army of Multiverse Batmen contained various iterations of the Batman from different media adaptions, such as from ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', the DC Animated Universe, the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series, and ''[[Batman Beyond]]''.

=== ''Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths'' ===
{{Main|Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths}}

The direct-to-video feature ''Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths'' deals with the Multiverse as part of its story. The main story deals with a good Lex Luthor from his Earth (based on the Pre-''Crisis'' [[Earth-Three]]) coming to the Earth where the Justice League are located to help fight their counterparts, the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]]. While the two Earths inhabited by the Justice League and Crime Syndicate are not named, names of other Earths are mentioned. These names are not from the official Pre-''Crisis'' nor post-''Infinite Crisis'' Multiverse, but are nods to a degree. Examples include: "Gamma F-1", "Theta-Alpha", "Zeta-Pi", which are all Greek numbers. [[Earth-Prime]] is featured in the film, but is not the same Earth-Prime from the comics, where it was "our" Earth. In the film, Earth-Prime is shown to be the cornerstone of all reality, and that decisions made by humankind on this world caused alternate Earths where the opposite decision was made to come into being. This world is shown to be a desolate barren wasteland of a planet, with ruins as far as the eye can see. It is unknown what exactly caused its desolation, though the Owlman reasons that it was [[Omnicide|mankind who destroyed itself]]. There was also an unnamed Earth that is mostly covered in ice. It was destroyed when the Owlman allowed the bomb to detonate with himself still on it.

=== ''Injustice'' ===
{{Main|Injustice: Gods Among Us|Injustice 2}}

The storyline of ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' features an alternate reality where the Joker has tricked Superman into killing Lois Lane and their unborn son and destroying Metropolis with a nuclear explosion. This tragedy completely ruins Superman's moral compass to the point of no return and the Kryptonian murders the Joker in retaliation. As time passes, he establishes a new world order, with himself as the High Councilor. Soon enough, Superman's iron-fisted rule triggers a war between the Regime and those allied with the Batman's Insurgency. High Councilor Superman begins a relationship with Wonder Woman who becomes one of his most devoted followers. Damian Wayne eventually sides with Superman against his father and kills Victor Zsasz. Cyborg also joins the Regime due to sharing his anger over the destruction of Metropolis. Dick Grayson is accidentally killed by Damian Wayne, which creates an even further rift between himself and his father, who mourns the death of his adopted son while Damian eventually adopts Dick's mantle of Nightwing. Harley Quinn leads a group called the Joker Gang who idolizes the Joker and fights alongside the Insurgency against the Regime. Both Black Adam and Billy Batson (Shazam) join the Regime. Hal Jordan becomes Yellow Lantern after joining the Sinestro Corps. which has allied itself with Superman's Regime against the Green Lantern Corps. The Green Arrow is killed by the Regime, leaving behind the Black Canary who is pregnant with their son Connor. The Black Canary is saved by Doctor Fate who transports her to an alternate Earth where Oliver Queen is still alive, though he has lost his Black Canary. Five years into the war, the Insurgency discovers an alternate universe where the Joker's plan did not succeed and transports several of its superheroes (Wonder Woman, the Batman, Aquaman, the Green Arrow, and Green Lantern) to their world in order to help them defeat the Regime. Unfortunately, the Joker of this universe is brought to the Regime universe and is killed. Also in this universe, Lex Luthor never becomes a criminal and instead he is a selfless businessman, best friend of this world's Superman and cares for the people of Metropolis, though he secretly sides with the Batman against the tyrannical Superman, only to be killed in battle. Together with the alternate universe Justice League and the Regime Flash, who defects from the Regime after Superman murders Shazam when he objects to Superman's plans to attack cities, the Regime Superman is defeated and imprisoned in the Red Son prison along with fellow Regime members Cyborg and Damian Wayne (Nightwing). Hal Jordan and Sinestro are imprisoned on Oa by the Guardians. The Flash allows himself to be taken into custody to face charges for his role in the Regime. After the Regime's fall, Bruce Wayne works to rebuild the world after the fall of the Regime. The alternate Justice League return to their universe.

The ''Injustice'' universe is featured at the beginning of ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'' as one of the many realities affected by [[Arak (comics)|Telos]]' Blood Moon.

In ''[[Injustice 2]]'', it is revealed that Krypton in this universe was attacked by Brainiac who collects the city of Kandor and destroys Argo City, which Kara Zor-El barely survives. Her mother saves her from Brainiac's Betas and reveals that Brainiac has destabilized the planet's core. Kara is tasked with watching over her baby cousin Kal-El and flees Krypton in a spaceship at the behest of her mother; however, her ship is damaged and knocked off course by the planet's explosion, which puts her into suspended animation. She is later found drifting through space by Black Adam, who takes her to Kahndaq where he and Wonder Woman have been hiding out since Superman was imprisoned. Black Adam and Wonder Woman train her in the hopes that her strength will give them the edge to free Kal-El. A flashback shows how Robin (Damian Wayne) joins Superman after killing the remorseless serial killer Victor Zsasz (which retcons the nature and timing of Damain's murder of Zsasz from the ''Injustice'' prequel comics). In the present, Damian Wayne and Cyborg are also incarcerated with Superman, while Aquaman has distanced himself away from the Regime to protect Atlantis. Meanwhile, Bruce is busy with the rebuilding the world after the Regime, forcing him to enlist other heroes such as the Black Canary, her husband the Green Arrow (from the alternate universe that the Black Canary was sent to by Doctor Fate), Firestorm and the Blue Beetle/Jaime Reyes as well as Harley Quinn, the Flash (who had been pardoned due to his role in taking down the Regime after the murder of Billy Batson by Superman) and Hal Jordan, who was reinstated as Green Lantern by the Guardians of the Universe, who managed to rehabilitate him. The Batman also constructs [[Brother Eye]] to monitor Earth for the Regime, the Society, and other potential threats. The Batman tasks the Black Canary, the Green Arrow, and Harley to deal with the Society, a group of supervillains formed by Gorilla Grodd after the fall of the Regime. During their confrontation with the Society in Gorilla City, they learn of an even greater threat posed by Brainiac which leads to the three being captured, though Harley escapes thanks to the intervention of the Catwoman, who had infiltrated the Society as an undercover mole. Brainiac hacks into Brother Eye and demands that Superman be handed over to him, though Bruce suits up and flees from the Batcave. Supergirl informs Wonder Woman and Black Adam of the threat posed by Brainiac and tells them they must get to her cousin before it is too late. This leads Kara and the Regime to break into the Red Son prison to free Superman, Cyborg, and Damian Wayne. However, the Blue Beetle and Firestorm protect the prison, but they are overwhelmed. Firestorm plans to destroy the Regime with a nuclear explosion, but the Batman tells him to stand down and decides that the threat posed by Brainiac is too great, leading the Insurgency and Regime to join forces to battle a common enemy. However, Supergirl begins to question what she had been told when Wonder Woman stabs Harley for trying to stop her from killing the Cheetah. Kara manages to save Harley's life, confronts her cousin and realizes that he has become a ruthless dictator like General Zod. After a brief battle with Robin, Black Adam, and Superman after her attempts to reason with Superman fail, they are interrupted by Brainiac's attack and Superman tells his cousin she must choose a side when it is over. During the battle with Brainiac's Skull Ship, Metropolis is destroyed again and Superman apparently killed. The Batman consoles Kara and tells her about how Superman was his friend once and refuses to accept Brainiac's proposal that he will spare Earth if Kara is handed over to him. She later joins the Batman in infiltrating Brainiac's ship, but Kara is captured, though Superman is revealed to be alive and he teams up with the Batman to stop Brainiac and save Kara. However, after Brainiac's defeat (which frees Kara) and Superman stopping the Skull Ship from crashing, the Regime and Insurgency clashes over how to deal with Brainiac as the Insurgency believes that if they spare Brainiac they will discover how to restore the collected cities and free their inhabitants, while Superman plans to kill Brainiac and restore the Regime, though Supergirl sides with the Insurgency, understanding that the Regime was planning to betray the Insurgency as soon as Brainiac was defeated. The story has two different endings.

* If Batman is selected, Kara works with the Batman and the Insurgency to defeat her cousin, though the Batman apologizes to Kara that she was not able to save Superman from himself. Superman is then imprisoned in the Phantom Zone though he swears to return, while the Batman convinces Kara that she can be a hero like her cousin had once been.
* If Superman is selected, then he confronts the redeemed Hal Jordan and the Flash, defeating them both. He also tells Kara that he is tired of holding back for fear of hurting others as he believes it is that fear that led to Lois' death. Kara laments that she is thankful that his father is not alive to see the person he has become, though Superman says that if his father had been more like Zod, he might have been able to save Krypton. Superman defeats both Kara and the Batman. The Batman, expecting to be killed, goads him to show him what a true villain he has become, though Superman relents, not wanting to make the Batman a martyr, and believes Kara will come around. He kills Brainiac and becomes one with his ship. Kara is imprisoned in Superman's old Red Son prison cell, where Superman shows her he has completely merged with Brainiac's ship and asks her if she will reconsider his offer to rule alongside him as family, before revealing to Kara's horror that he has gained Brainiac's ability to control others, which he demonstrates by showing her the Batman, who has been brainwashed by Superman, and suggests he will do the same to Kara if she refuses. Superman plans to expand his Regime into a Legion by recruiting beings from Brainiac's collection. He plans to use this Legion to bring peace to his universe and the multiverse. In the game's Multiverse Mode, Brother Eye monitors the infinite Multiverse for threats, sending heroes to combat threats or aid allies from other universes.

=== ''Infinite Crisis'' (video game) ===
{{Main|Infinite Crisis (video game)}}

The video game ''Infinite Crisis'' (which is unrelated to the [[Infinite Crisis|comic book of the same name]]) features a multiverse with 52 different worlds. This multiverse is threatened by a sudden assault and all realities stand on the brink of annihilation. Now, the last hope for Earth lies in the powers of the DC legends.

During the events of the tie-in comic book ''Infinite Crisis: Fight for the Multiverse'', it is said that the Monitors were a race of beings native to the world of Nil that resided outside all realities in the Overvoid. Their existence came following the creation of the Multiverse and the Bleed where they watched the infinite Earths and sought to protect the infinite strands of creation. It was claimed that they were a people that cared little about the existence of the inhabitants of these universes and more for the preservation of their grand order. Such was their existence, until one of their kind turned against the others and became the Anti-Monitor. A Crisis emerged as a result whereby many universes were destroyed, but the Anti-Monitor was defeated at the cost of almost the entire Monitor race. From this Crisis, there existed only 52 universes left in the Multiverse that were kept in perfect balance. The only survivor of their race was Nix Uotan, who detected a new Crisis emerging from an unknown menace who made use of corrupted Monitor technology and struck at Earth-48. Nix Uotan returned to his people's home world in order to reactivate the machinery to help contain the damage from the Crisis. As a result, he began to seek out champions and even villains to help combat this menace from across the Multiverse. These individuals would be charged with recovering artifacts from across the many Earths that were being taken by the mysterious enemy to aid in their assault. Among his agents was a human female from Earth-48 who went by the name of Harbinger.

The featured alternate Earths are those of the [[New 52]] DC Multiverse.

* Prime Earth is Earth-0, DC's core alternate universe.
* "Arcane" Earth is Earth-13.
* "Atomic" Earth is the post-apocalyptic Earth-17.
*  "[[Gotham by Gaslight|Gaslight]]" Earth is the [[Edwardian]] analogue [[steampunk]] Earth-19.
* "Nightmare" Earth is the vampiric metahuman-dominated Earth-43.
* "Mecha" Earth is Earth-44, on which robotics scientists created the Metal/Mecha League, analogues of Prime Earth superheroes.

[[Superman]], [[Supergirl]], [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]], the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], [[Harley Quinn]], the [[Catwoman]],  [[Wonder Woman]], the [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] are featured as player possibilities, each with alternate versions amongst the six featured alternate Earth scenarios.

In this reality, the Monitors had access to energy constructs that were able to record messages and transmit communiques across the Multiverse. They also forged orbs that glowed with light and served as a guide across the alternate universes as well as serve as a communicator with the Monitors. On their homeworld of Nil, there were spatial engines that could be used to help prevent large scale universal breaches that would damage the Multiverse.

=== Arrowverse and DC Extended Universe ===
{{Main|Arrowverse|DC Extended Universe}}

In July 2014, DC CCO [[Geoff Johns]] confirmed that the universe present in the publisher's television series, ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', is separate from the one being built in their films with ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' and ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''. In October 2014, Johns explained DC's difference in approach to [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]], saying "We look at it as the multiverse. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through...It's just a different approach."

The Multiverse concept is explored during the second season of ''The Flash'', which is pivotal to the conflicts between Barry Allen ([[Grant Gustin]]) and rogue speedster [[Hunter Zolomon]] ([[Teddy Sears]]). The access points to the Multiverse are portals that were created as a result of an exploding singularity over Central City during the season 2 premiere "The Man Who Saved Central City". In the episode "Enter Zoom", it is revealed that Earth-2's version of the [[Green Arrow]] is Robert Queen ([[Jamey Sheridan]]) instead of his son [[Oliver Queen (Arrow)|Oliver]] ([[Stephen Amell]]), who presumably died on the boat accident. In the season 2 finale "The Race of His Life", Zoom reveals that the universe in which that of ''Arrow'', ''The Flash'' and ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' sets is positioned in the Multiverse's center, and from there one could travel to any of the other infinite numbers of Earths.  After [[Jay Garrick]] is rescued from Zoom, he reveals that he is from yet another Earth, designated Earth-3. In the Season 3 episode "The New Rogues", the Flash team explore the multiverse in search of a [[Harrison Wells]] doppelganger to replace the Earth-2 version. They encounter four others from various Earths, two of which are named Earth-17 and Earth-19, from which their new recruit, Harrison "H.R." Wells, originates.

The television series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' exists as another alternate universe separate from the main Arrowverse continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/02/supergirl-the-flash-crossover-official-in-march-1201695796/|title=Crossover Confirmed: 'The Flash' To Meet 'Supergirl' In March Episode|last=Lincoln|first=Ross A.|date=February 3, 2016|accessdate=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is confirmed in the ''Supergirl'' episode "[[Worlds Finest]]", when the Flash appears on Supergirl's universe and names heroes from his world (the Green Arrow, the Black Canary, the Atom, Firestorm) that Supergirl does not recognize. In addition, the Flash's allies Dr. Harrison Wells, Caitlin Snow, and Cisco Ramon do not exist in Supergirl's universe, and S.T.A.R. Labs was not founded due to Wells' absence. Barry Allen does note that they do share celebrities, such as singer [[Mariah Carey]] and writer [[Alexandre Dumas]], who wrote ''[[The Three Musketeers]]''. Supergirl's universe is coined Earth-38 by Cisco Ramon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/24447-the-flash-supergirl-lives-earth-38-multiverse|title='The Flash' Just Announced That Supergirl Lives on Earth-38|publisher=Inverse|last=Francisco|first=Eric|date=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent episodes from ''Legends of Tomorrow,'' ''Supergirl,'' and ''The Flash'' reveal that both Supergirl and Barry's universes also share the existences of the alien races of [[Thanagar]]ians and [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominators]].

The 2017 crossover event ''[[Crisis on Earth-X]]''- which sees the heroes from all four shows face an invasion from the titular 'Earth-X', as a world where the Nazis won [[World War II]]- establishes that there are 52 known alternate Earths, with the titular 'Earth-X' being the fifty-third Earth, described by Harrison "Harry" Wells of Earth-2, that those who aware of the multiverse as being so dark and horrific that no interdimensional traveler would dare to journey there. Its history is basically the same as Earth-1, Earth-2, and Earth-38's, except the outcomes of World War II and [[Adolf Hitler]] continued his reign worldwide until his death in 1994. Its inhabitants include counterparts of people from these Earths as well, including Oliver Queen's doppelgänger, who is Hitler's successor as Führer and the villainous archer the Dark Arrow.

=== ''Teen Titans'' ===
{{Main|Teen Titans}}

Issue #48 introduces its own multiverse. Each world pays references to various incarnation of the [[Teen Titans]]. The worlds shown are:

* The majority of the story is set on a world which is menaced by the Teen Tyrants (evil Teen Titans), and is defended by the Brotherhood of Justice (heroic versions of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]). Similar to [[Crime Syndicate of America|Earth-3]].
* Malchior's (from the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' episode "Spellbound") homeworld.
* A world similar to the past from the ''Teen Titans'' episode "[[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] the Barbarian".

== Parodies ==
* [[Bongo Comics]] published a comic book series featuring characters from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''Futurama'' titled ''Futurama/Simpsons Infinitely Secret Crossover Crisis''. One of the conventions of DC's Multiverse that the series parodies is the existence of one universe's characters as fictional comic book characters in another.
* [[IDW Publishing|IDW]]'s ''Super Secret Crisis War!'', parodies DC's ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s ''[[Secret Wars|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars]]'' in their logo as this is a major crossover event featuring several characters and their worlds from their [[Cartoon Network]]-based publications.

'''Paper craft''' is the collection of [[art]] forms employing [[paper]] or [[card stock|card]] as the primary [[artistic medium]] for the creation of three-dimensional objects.  It is the most widely used material in arts and crafts. It lends itself to a wide range of techniques, as it can for instance be folded, cut, glued, molded,  stitched, or layered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=6 |title=The Complete Photo Guide to Paper Crafts|first=Patrice |last=Boerens |isbn=978-1-58923-468-0 |publisher=Creative Publishing International |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Papermaking]] by hand is also an important paper craft. [[Painting]] and [[calligraphy]] though they are commonly applied as decoration are normally considered as separate arts or crafts.

Paper crafts are known in most societies that use paper, with certain kinds of crafts being particularly associated with specific countries or cultures. In Caribbean countries paper craft is unique to Caribbean culture which reflect the importance of native animals in life of people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caribbean-craft.com/|title=Handmade Home Decor {{!}} Paper Mache {{!}} Caribbean Craft|last=Craft|first=Caribbean|website=www.caribbean-craft.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In addition to the aesthetic value of paper crafts, various forms of paper crafts are used in the [[education]] of children.  Paper is a relatively inexpensive medium, readily available, and easier to work with than the more complicated media typically used in the creation of three-dimensional artwork, such as ceramics, wood, and metals.&lt;ref name="Therapy"&gt;Carol Tubbs, Margaret Drake, ''Crafts and Creative Media in Therapy'', "Paper crafts", (2006), p. 221-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also neater to work with than paints, dyes, and other coloring materials.  Paper crafts may also be used in [[psychotherapy|therapeutic]] settings, providing children with a safe and uncomplicated creative outlet to express feelings.&lt;ref name="Therapy"/&gt;

==Folded paper==
The word "paper" derives from [[papyrus]], the name of the ancient material manufactured from beaten reeds in [[Egypt]] as far back as the third millennium B.C.&lt;ref name=Skeat&gt;[http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/Egerton/BellSkeat2.html H. Idris Bell and T.C. Skeat, 1935. "Papyrus and its uses"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018121945/http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/Egerton/BellSkeat2.html |date=2013-10-18 }} ([[British Museum]] pamphlet).&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the earliest known example of "paper folding" is an ancient Egyptian map, drawn on papyrus and folded into rectangular forms like a modern [[road]] [[map]].&lt;ref name="Bible"/&gt; However, it does not appear that intricate paper folding as an art form became possible until the introduction of wood-pulp based papers.&lt;ref name="Bible"/&gt; 

The first Japanese origami is dated from the 6th century A.D.&lt;ref name="Lang"&gt;Lang, Robert James. [1988] (1988). The Complete Book of Origami: Step-by Step Instructions in Over 1000 Diagrams/48 Original Models. Courier Dover Publications. {{ISBN|0-486-25837-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In much of the [[Western world|West]], the term [[origami]] is used synonymously with paper folding, though the term properly only refers to the art of paper folding in [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="Bible"&gt;Nick Robinson, ''The Origami Bible'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  Other forms of paper folding include Zhezhi ([[Chinese paper folding]]), Jong-i.e.-jeop-gi, from Korea, and Western paper folding, such as the traditional paper boats and [[paper plane]]s.

==Cut paper==
{{Main|Papercutting}}
[[Papel picado]], as practiced in Mexico and other places in Latin America is done using chisels to cut 50 to a hundred sheets at a time, while [[Chinese paper cutting]] uses knives or scissors for up to 8 sheets. [[Wycinanki]] and other European forms usually are done on one single sheet. In either of these traditions, paper sheets are folded prior to cutting to achieve symmetrical designs.

==Paper pulp painting==

Images built using colored paper pulp are a form of paper art that started in the 20th century. [[Chuck Close]], [[Lynn Sures]] are among contemporary artist developing this medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3664">In [[fashion]] and [[clothing]], a '''petite size''' is a [[US standard clothing size|standard clothing size]] designed to fit women of shorter height than the average, typically {{convert|160|cm|ftin|abbr=on}}.

==Changes in pattern measurements and design==

Regular female sized [[clothing]] is designed for a woman at least {{convert|165|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} tall (without shoes) and will not fit a woman of significantly shorter height well.  Even if the bust, waist and hip circumferences are appropriate, the sleeve lengths, leg [[inseam]] lengths and vertical torso measurements (such as the back length and bust-waist length) must be altered significantly to fit well. Non-petite size dresses cannot be easily altered to produce the equivalent petite size, since, in general, these lengths (particularly the critical torso measurements) cannot be altered without introducing an unsightly seam. Significant errors in the torso measurements will make a well-fitted look impossible, e.g., if the bust-point darts are off by three inches.

In addition to its measurements, a petite-size garment may have a different ''design'' from those intended for taller women.  For example, style elements may be added to give a longer, slimmer look, e.g., vertical stripes, princess seams, short skirts, large patterns or patterns arranged helically around the whole body.  Unfortunately, many modern "petite" sizes are actually renamed [[US standard clothing size|half sizes]] intended for large women and, as a result, tend to be boxy and unfashionable for small-framed women.  Designs for taller women may also have [[style line]]s that appear to shorten the figure, such as horizontal lines (e.g., clamdigger pants or midcalf skirts); hence, even if the measurements are adjusted correctly, a petite-size version of a regular-size garment may be unflattering.

==Frequency==

The average height of an American woman is roughly {{convert|163|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} (5'4"), with a standard deviation of roughly {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}}.  Thus, 40% of all American women are {{convert|160|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} or shorter (&lt;math&gt;z &lt;= -0.25&lt;/math&gt;) and  roughly one-quarter (25%) are {{convert|155|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} or shorter (&lt;math&gt;z &lt;= -0.75&lt;/math&gt;).  

In the UK and throughout much of Europe and Australasia, the average height varies from {{convert|152|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} to {{convert|168|cm|ftin|abbr=on}}.  The old clothes sizes tended to correspond to the UK's 1951 size survey, which took {{convert|157|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} as average height, and also took a slim, hour glass figure as standard.  In the 1990s the Size UK project examined 16,000 people and changed the measurements for the 'average' size.  This was widely reported, but stores responded to the headline (people getting bigger) rather than the facts (height rising only slightly but many individuals fatter). The fashion industry provides most of its merchandise in "standard sizes", which encompasses women sizes 4-14, 5'4" to 5'8" in height (European sizes 34-44 and 1.6256-1.7272 m), because this is the most profitable ready-to-wear market.&lt;ref name="Fashion For Real Women"&gt;[http://www.fashionforrealwomen.com/articles/petite_plus_tall_size.html Petite, Plus, or Tall Size'”]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Preacher''''' is an [[American comic book]] series published by  [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]], an [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[DC Comics]].  The series was created by writer [[Garth Ennis]] and artist [[Steve Dillon]] with painted covers by [[Glenn Fabry]].

The series consists of 75 issues in total - 66 regular, monthly issues, five [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot specials]] and a four-issue ''Preacher: Saint of Killers'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]. The entire run has been collected in nine trade paperback editions. The final monthly issue, number 66, was published in October 2000.

==Plot==
{{See also|List of Preacher story arcs}}

''Preacher'' tells the story of [[Jesse Custer]], a preacher in the small [[Texas]] town of Annville. Custer is accidentally possessed by the supernatural creature named Genesis, the infant of the unauthorized, unnatural coupling of an angel and a demon. The incident flattens Custer's church and kills his entire congregation.

Genesis has no sense of individual will, but since it is composed of both pure goodness and pure evil, its power might rival that of God Himself, making Jesse Custer, bonded to Genesis, potentially the most powerful being in the universe.

Driven by a strong sense of right and wrong, Custer journeys across the United States attempting to literally find God, who abandoned Heaven the moment Genesis was born. He also begins to discover the truth about his new powers. They allow him, when he wills it, to command the obedience of those who hear and comprehend his words. He is joined by his old girlfriend [[Tulip O'Hare]], as well as a hard-drinking Irish vampire named [[Cassidy (DC Comics)|Cassidy]].

During the course of their journeys, the three encounter enemies and obstacles both sacred and profane, including [[The Saint of Killers]], an invincible, quick-drawing, perfect-aiming, come-lately [[Death (personification)|Angel of Death]] answering only to "He who sits on the throne"; a disfigured suicide attempt survivor turned rock-star named Arseface; a serial-killer called the 'Reaver-Cleaver'; The Grail, a secret organization controlling the governments of the world and protecting the bloodline of Jesus; Herr Starr, ostensible Allfather of the Grail, a megalomaniac with a penchant for prostitutes, who wishes to use Custer for his own ends; several fallen angels; and Jesse's own [[redneck]] 'family' — particularly his nasty [[Cajun]] grandmother, her mighty bodyguard Jody, and the 'animal-loving' T.C.

==Adaptation attempts==
[[Garth Ennis]], feeling ''Preacher'' would translate perfectly as a film, sold the [[film rights]] to [[Electric Entertainment]]. [[Rachel Talalay]] was hired to direct, with Ennis writing the script. Rupert Harvey and [[Tom Astor]] were set as producers. By May 1998, Ennis completed three drafts of the script, based largely on the ''Gone to Texas'' story arc.&lt;ref name=Stax&gt;{{cite news | author = Stax | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035980p1.html | title = The Stax report: Script Review of ''Preacher'' | work = [[IGN]] | date = 2000-02-10 | accessdate = 2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filmmakers found it difficult financing ''Preacher'' because investors found the idea religiously controversial. Ennis approached [[Kevin Smith]] and [[Scott Mosier]] to help finance the film under their [[View Askew Productions]] banner. Ennis, Smith and Mosier [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]]ed ''Preacher'' to [[Bob Weinstein]] at [[Miramax Films]].&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

Weinstein was confused by the characterization of [[Jesse Custer]]. Miramax also did not want to share the box office gross with Electric Entertainment, ultimately dropping the pitch. By May 2000, Smith and Mosier were still attached to produce with Talalay directing, but Smith did not know the status of ''Preacher'', feeling it would languish in [[development hell]].&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite news | author = Elston Gunn | url = http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=5942 | title = Elston Gunn interviews Kevin Smith | date = 2000-05-14 | work = [[Ain't It Cool News]] | accessdate = 2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Storm Entertainment, a UK-based production company known for their work on [[independent films]], joined the production with Electric Entertainment.&lt;ref name="Stax" /&gt; In September 2001, the two companies announced ''Preacher'' had been [[greenlight]]ed to commence [[pre-production]], with filming to begin in November and Talalay still directing Ennis' script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Drew McWeeny | url = http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=10086 | title = ''Preacher'' Has Got A Greenlight!!

[[James Marsden]] was cast in the lead role as Jesse Custer sometime in 2002. He explained, "It was something I never knew anything about, but once I got my hands on the comic books, I was blown away by it."&lt;ref name="James" /&gt; In a March 2004 interview, Marsden said the filmmakers were hoping for filming to start the following August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Stax | title = Marsden on ''Preacher'' | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/500/500745p1.html | work = [[IGN]] | date = 2004-03-22 | accessdate = 2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the full-length film adaptation eventually abandoned with budgetary concerns,&lt;ref name=James/&gt; [[HBO]] announced in November 2006 that they commissioned [[Mark Steven Johnson]] and [[Howard Deutch]] to produce a [[television pilot]]. Johnson was to write with Deutch directing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Eric Goldman | url = http://tv.ign.com/articles/748/748151p1.html | title = HBO Prays for ''Preacher'' | work = [[IGN]] | date = 2006-11-29 | accessdate = 2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed with Johnson's pilot script, HBO had him write the [[bible (writing)|series bible]] for the first season.&lt;ref name="if"&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Brown |title=Exclusive Interview: Mark Steven Johnson Finds Religion With ''Preach'' - Part 1 |url=http://ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=2148 |work=IF Magazine |date=2007-06-10 |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228040805/http://ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=2148 |archivedate=February 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson originally planned "to turn each comic book issue into a single episode" on a [[shot-for-shot]] basis. "I gave [HBO] the comics, and I said, 'Every issue is an hour'. Garth Ennis said 'You don't have to be so beholden to the comic'. And I'm like, 'No, no, no. It's got to be like the comic'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Cindy White |title=Johnson Talks HBO's ''Preacher'' |work=[[Sci Fi Wire]] |date=2006-12-01 |url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&amp;id=39072 |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028195714/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&amp;id=39072 |archivedate=October 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson also wanted to make sure that [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]]s were included as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Daniel Robert Epstein |title=Johnson Talks HBO's ''Preacher'' |work=[[Newsarama]] |url=http://www.newsarama.com/movies/Preacher/MSJPreacher.html |date=2006-12-05 |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013191548/http://newsarama.com/movies/Preacher/MSJPreacher.html |archivedate=October 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson changed his position, citing new storylines conceived by Ennis. "Well, there would be nothing new to add if we did that, so Garth [Ennis] and I have been creating new stories for the series," he said. "I love the book so much and I was telling Garth that he has to make the stories we are coming up with as comics because I want to see them."&lt;ref name="if" /&gt; By August 2008, new [[studio executive]]s at HBO decided to abandon the idea, finding it too stylistically dark and religiously controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Rob Allstetter | title = Mark Steven Johnson: No ''Preacher'' On HBO | url = http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0808/25/index.htm | work = Comics Continuum | date = 2008-08-25 | accessdate = 2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Columbia Pictures]] then purchased the film rights in October 2008 with [[Sam Mendes]] planned to direct. [[Neal H. Moritz]] and Jason Netter would have produced the film.

==Legacy==
[[Stephen King]] has said that his comic book series ''[[The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger Born]]'' was influenced by ''Preacher''.&lt;ref&gt;King's afterword to ''[[The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger Born]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The character Yorick from ''[[Y: The Last Man]]'', has a Zippo lighter with the words "Fuck Communism" engraved, identical to the one owned by Jesse Custer in ''Preacher''. When asked about it he says it's "from this book I read once... a graphic novel. You know, like a comic book." The phrase originated as a 1963 satirical poster produced by ''[[The Realist]]'' magazine's [[Paul Krassner]].&lt;ref&gt;"Realist Archive Project", http://www.ep.tc/realist/fuckcommunism/&lt;/ref&gt; This lighter appears later in the series when Yorick and Agent 355 are being held by Russian agents at gunpoint, who find the lighter and take offense to it. Also, in volume 4 "Safeword", Yorick says "pardners", which is used several times in ''Preacher'', in lieu of "partners".&lt;ref&gt;''Y: The Last Man,'' #55, May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IGN]] declared Preacher the third-greatest Vertigo comic, after ''[[Saga of the Swamp Thing]]'' and ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics/Vertigo)|Sandman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/677/677353p5.html|title=The 25 Best Vertigo Books|author=Hilary Goldstein|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesse Custer was ranked the 11th Greatest Comic Book Character by ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=11 Jesse Custer], "The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters", ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', accessed April 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Saint of Killers was ranked at number 42 on the same list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=42 The Saint of Killers], "The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters", ''Empire'', accessed April 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''presidential sash''' is a cloth [[sash]] worn by [[president]]s of many nations in the world. Such sashes are worn by presidents in Africa, Asia, Europe and, most notably, in Latin America.

The sash is an important symbol of the continuity of the presidency, and is only worn by the president. Its value as a symbol of the office of the head of state can be compared to that of a [[crown (headgear)|crown]] in monarchies. When the president leaves office, he or she formally presents the sash to his or her successor as part of the official [[inauguration]] ceremony.

Presidential sashes are usually very colorful, and designed to resemble the nation's flag, especially those of Latin American presidents. They are usually worn over the right shoulder to the left side of the hip. The national [[coat of arms]] is also usually placed on the sash. A [[Order (decoration)|national order]]'s star or chain of office can also be worn.

The show focuses on a little robot who is composed of several [[sphere]]s and other [[three-dimensional]] geometric shapes. The show was one of the earliest series that was fully animated in [[Computer animation|CG]], and the first CG-animated preschool series.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} ''Rolie Polie Olie'' aired reruns on [[Disney Junior]] from March 23, 2012 – September 28, 2014.

''Rolie Polie Olie'' won a [[Gemini Award]] in Canada for "Best Animated Program" in 1999. The show also won a Daytime [[Emmy Award]] for "Outstanding Special Class Animated Program" in 2000 and 2005. William Joyce won a 1999 Daytime Emmy for Best Production Design for this series.{{citation needed|date= October 2011}} The show has a vintage atmosphere reminiscent of the 1950s to mid-1960s,{{citation needed|date= October 2011}} with futuristic elements.

==Synopsis==
The show focuses on the Polie Family, who live in a teapot-shaped house in a [[geometric]] world (Planet Polie) populated by [[robot]]-based characters. The stories revolve around a young robot named Olie learning life lessons and going on wacky adventures (either real or imaginative) while growing up. These often include his little sister Zowie, his inventor father, his hard-working mom, his fun-loving grandfather Pappy, and his dog Spot. Although most of the main cast is composed of circular bots, other characters are featured in other shapes, such as Olie's friend Billy Bevel and his family, who are square-shaped bots from Planet Cubey.

==Characters==
* Olie Polie &amp;ndash; A robot boy and the show's main character. He is very friendly, inquisitive, and loves his family and friends.
* Zowie Polie &amp;ndash; Olie's younger sister, Gizmo's niece, Pappy's granddaughter and Mom and Dad's daughter. She is also very inquisitive (The episode ''But Why?'', for example, has her keep on annoying the family by asking "Why?" about everything imaginable) and loud. She loves Olie and enjoys emulating him, sometimes to Olie's chagrin, too. Her name is actually pronounced like the name "Zoey" instead of like the word "zowie" (which rhymes with Howie).
* Spot &amp;ndash; Spot is Olie's faithful dog. As revealed in the episode ''But Why?'', he was given his name because he left a "spot" on the carpet as a puppy.
* Mr. Percy Polie &amp;ndash; Olie and Zowie's father and Pappy's second son. He is an inventor, similar to G2 Droid from [[Star Tours]], whose various inventions frequently get out of hand and gets him and the family into trouble.
* Mrs. Polina Polie &amp;ndash; Olie and Zowie's mother. She is a [[Homemaking|homemaker]].
* Pappy Polie &amp;ndash; Percy and Gizmo's father and Olie and Zowie's grandfather. He runs a farm by himself and is best known for his unruly [[dentures]].
* Billy Bevel &amp;ndash; Olie's best friend. He lives next door. He is a cube shaped boy who, along with his family, is originally from Planet Cubey.
* Gizmo Polie &amp;ndash; Olie and Zowie's uncle who is also Mr. Polie's brother and Pappy's older son. He rides a motorcycle named Motorboy, and he also has an [[Elvis Presley]] like impression.
* Aunt Polieanna &amp;ndash; Olie and Zowie's great aunt and Pappy's sister who appears in The Baby Bot Chase and in Season 6.
* Baxter and Bonita Jaquita Bevel &amp;ndash; Billy's parents. Baxter wears glasses and has a surprisingly deep laugh, despite having a somewhat high-pitched voice. Bonita is an accomplished dancer and acts similar to her husband. They are friends of Mr. and Mrs. Polie.
* Space Boy &amp;ndash; A young super-hero and star of Olie's favorite TV show Space Boy. Along with his companion Space Dog, he frequently saves the universe from various threats on his show, and occasionally appears to help out Olie. Both Space Boy and Space Dog resemble Olie and Spot, with the main difference being that Space Boy and Space Dog are blue and silver, and Olie and Spot are yellow and brown.
* Coochie and Coo Polie &amp;ndash; Olie and Zowie's adopted baby brother and sister. They first appeared in the movie The Baby Bot Chase and the Season 6 episodes.
* Binky Bevel &amp;ndash; Billy's baby brother. His head has the ability to spin when his [[Navel|belly button]] is pressed in. He is best friends with Zowie. At first, Zowie was jealous of Binky and did not want to get along with him. But soon they became friends.
* Screwy &amp;ndash; A new kid in town, specifically being a [[lug nut|lugnut]]. In his early appearances, Screwy acts as a [[bullying|bully]] towards Olie and his friends; one episode had Olie actually driven to punch him. However, Screwy quickly became a member of the gang.
*Polly Pi &amp;ndash; A [[Red hair|red-haired]] female classmate and friend of Olie and Billy. She first appeared in the [[Valentine's Day]]&amp;ndash;themed episode ''Looove Bug'', where she moves into Polieville, and Olie and Billy, who compete with each other for Polly's affections, immediately fell in love (via being bitten by the [[Cupid|Love Bug]]) with her until they bumped into Mr. Polie. Polly owns a pink poodle named Fifi.
* Wheelie &amp;ndash; An older kid with a single wheel instead of legs due to the fact of him being a "Roll Bot." He is very athletic and acts as a sort of [[mentor]] towards Olie and Billy.
* Dicey &amp;ndash; Billy's pet cat. She is often chased by Spot. She is an orange cat with a body that, as her name implies, resembles two dice.
* Mrs. Ethel Triangle &amp;ndash; Olie's teacher. She has a triangular hairstyle, body and, earrings.
* Big Gene Green and Little Gene Green &amp;ndash; Two aliens from the Little Green Planet who accidentally crash&amp;ndash;landed on Polieville and befriended Olie and his family. They reappear when Olie and his dad visit their planet, only to find it much too small for their comfort. They are notable for the way they often 'backward speak' sentences similar to Yoda.
* Chuck Squarey &amp;ndash; A pop musician who, like the Bevells, is from Planet Cubey. His song and dance, "The Twirl," is a major hit around the galaxy. He is apparently friends with his fans, the Bevels and the Polies.
* Klanky Klaus &amp;ndash; The show's equivalent of [[Santa Claus]], he lives on his own planet, Chillsville.
* Gloomius Maximus &amp;ndash; An evil space pirate who can stop the fun, and make the universe gloomy. He is the main villain in ''The Great Defender of Fun'' and makes a few appearances on the show during Season 6 as reformed character.

{{Nihongo|'''''Rozen Maiden'''''|ローゼンメイデン|Rōzen Meiden|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Peach-Pit]]. It was serialized in ''[[Monthly Comic Birz]]'' between the September 2002 and July 2007 issues. The individual chapters were collected and released into eight ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes by [[Gentosha]]. The eight volumes were localized to North America by [[Tokyopop]] between March 2003 and June 2007. The story follows Jun Sakurada, a middle school student who withdrew from society after suffering persecutions from his classmates. Following his withdrawal, he is chosen to become the master to a Rozen Maiden named Shinku. Rozen Maidens are seven sentient [[bisque doll]]s who compete against each other to become a perfect doll dubbed as Alice.

''Rozen Maiden'' received a sequel under the series' [[katakana]] title. It was serialized in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Weekly Young Jump]]'' between April 2008 and January 2014. ''Rozen Maiden'' has spun off anthology manga and novel stories, [[art book]]s, and four [[anime]] series; the four anime series are titled ''Rozen Maiden'', ''Rozen Maiden: Träumend'', ''Rozen Maiden: Ouvertüre'', and ''Rozen Maiden: Zurückspulen''. [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] were the producers for the anime with [[Nomad (company)|Nomad]] as the [[animation studio]] for the first three series and [[Studio Deen]] for ''Zurückspulen''. The anime adaptions resulted in several [[Rozen Maiden discography|audio disc releases]] and three video games.

In 2007, [[Geneon Universal Entertainment|Geneon Entertainment USA]] licensed the first two anime series for North American release and had later signed [[Funimation]] on as a distributor, after shutting down in September 2007. In 2011, [[Sentai Filmworks]] acquired both seasons as well as the third series; they made the three series available for streaming on [[Anime Network]]. [[Crunchyroll]] later acquired streaming rights to the first two series. For the fourth series, Sentai Filmworks had acquired the license for digital and home video release, while Crunchyroll acquired streaming rights.

Tokyopop's volumes of ''Rozen Maiden'' have appeared on ICv2's monthly top one-hundred selling graphic novels. Reviews towards the manga were generally positive with reviewers praising balance in drama and comedy. For the anime, reception towards the first series was mixed while ''Träumend'' was mostly negative.

==Plot==
In the 20th century, a legendary doll maker named Rozen created seven [[bisque doll]]s which were powered and given sentience with a gem called Rosa Mystica.{{Ref|Phase|Phase 2}} Since then, Rozen sent the dolls away to find masters and to battle among themselves to gather each other's Rosa Mysticas; this competition is referred to as the Alice Game. When a doll obtains all seven, they are to become a perfect doll dubbed as Alice and will be reunited with Rozen.{{Ref|Phase|Phase 5}} By order of creation, the seven Rozen Maidens are named [[#Suigintou|Suigintou]], [[#Kanaria|Kanaria]], [[#Suiseiseki|Suiseiseki]], [[#Souseiseki|Souseiseki]], [[#Shinku|Shinku]], [[#Hinaichigo|Hinaichigo]], and [[#Kirakisho|Kirakisho]].

''Rozen Maiden'' follows Jun Sakurada, a middle school student who has withdrawn from society after suffering persecutions from his classmates. He is chosen to become Shinku's master and joins the Alice Game.{{Ref|Phase|Prologue 2}} As the series progresses, Jun also becomes the master to Hinaichigo and Suiseiseki. After Souseiseki's Rosa Mystica is taken by Suigintou, Jun's Rozen Maidens resolve to revive her and to end the Alice Game peacefully;{{Ref|Phase|Phase 21}} they later befriend Kanaria who shares their sentiments. However, the group is attacked by Kirakisho who absorbs Hinaichigo and traps Shinku and Suiseiseki in the N-field, a [[Plane (esotericism)|plane]] of consciousness which connects the universe. ''Rozen Maiden'' concludes with Jun preparing to enter the N-field to save the dolls.{{Ref|Phase|Phase 43}}

''Rozen Maiden''{{'}}s plot is continued in the sequel serialization which uses the katakana title of the series.{{ref|KK|KK}} Inside the N-field, Jun is forced into hiding by Kirakisho and contacts an adult version of himself from an alternate world.{{Ref|Tale|Tale 1}} The adult Jun is able to free Shinku and unite the Rozen Maidens to defeat Kirakisho.{{Ref|Tale|Tale 25}} Kirakisho returns and successfully captures all the Rozen Maidens' masters. The Rozen Maidens pursue her eventually resulting in most of their defeat except Shinku and Kirakisho. Shinku's sympathy towards Kirakisho's loneliness convinces the latter to surrender her Rosa Mystica. With all seven gathered, Shinku becomes Alice.{{Ref|Tale|Tale 65}} Using her new powers, Shinku revives her sisters and is put into a coma in return.{{Ref|Tale|Tale 66}}

The '''Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra''' ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''Sarajevska filharmonija'' / Сарајевска филхармонија) is an orchestra in [[Sarajevo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/can-the-sarajevo-philharmonic-hang-on/Content?oid=1511499 Can the Sarajevo Philharmonic Hang On? The siege may be over, but a host of post-Communist problems now threaten Bosnia's cultural institutions] March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Its first concert was performed on October 24, 1923, with the program being "[[Vatroslav Lisinski|Lisinski]]: ''Overture from the opera "[[Porin (opera)|Porin]]"''; [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], ''Concert g-minor for piano and orchestra''; [[Beethoven]]: ''[[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second Symphony]]''." The [[Conducting|conductors]] were A. Lukinić and J. Rozdalovski.  

The outbreak of World War II disrupted the activities of the Orchestra, which was reestablished in October 1948.  During the [[Bosnian War]], the Orchestra again suffered disruption.  During the [[Siege of Sarajevo]], seven members of the Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra were killed and twelve were wounded.  The archive of musical scores was damaged and many instruments were destroyed, damaged or lost.  During the war, however, the Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra continued its work and performed 60 concerts, 20 of them abroad. The rehearsals were performed in hard winter conditions, in basements, and without heating and only by candlelight.

The Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra performed on June 19, 1994 amongst the ruins of Sarajevo City Hall. [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]]'' was performed, and maestro [[Zubin Mehta]] conducted the concert with soloists [[José Carreras]], [[Ruggero Raimondi]], [[Cecilia Gasdia]] and [[Ildikó Komlósi]]. 

In September 1994, the Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra toured in [[Italy]], and subsequently in [[Austria]] (1995, 1996), [[Turkey]] (1995), the [[Czech Republic]] (1995), [[France]] (1997), [[Switzerland]] (1997, 2000), and again in Italy (1995–1997). 

The Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra visited and organized concerts in several cities in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. 

In October 1996 [[Yehudi Menuhin]] came to Sarajevo and conducted the Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra.  In 1997, by the invitation of [[UNESCO]]'s Director-General, [[Federico Mayor Zaragoza]], the Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra went to Paris and performed a concert there. 

In 1998 the Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra performed in [[Ravenna]], and in 1999, in the United States and Netherlands; in the summers of 1998 and 1999, the Orchestra collaborated with AIDIMOS and its director, German conductor Ernest Schelle, touring around all the main cities of Bosnia with conductors and additional musicians from amongst others, Albania, Austria, Croatia, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. In March 1997, the Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra recorded its first [[CD]], 'Sarajevo Renaissance'.

{{Sex (biology) sidebar}}
'''Sexual dimorphism''' is the condition where the two [[sex]]es of the same species exhibit different characteristics beyond the differences in their sexual organs. The condition occurs in many animals and some plants. Differences may include [[secondary sex characteristic]]s, size, weight, color, markings, and may also include behavioral and cognitive differences. These differences may be subtle or exaggerated, and may be subjected to [[sexual selection]]. The opposite of dimorphism is ''monomorphism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://human-biology.key-spot.ru/search.php?key=sexual+monomorphism|title=Dictionary of Human Evolution and Biology|website=Human-biology.key-spot.ru|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ornamentation and coloration===
Common and easily identified types of dimorphism are [[Biological ornament|ornamentation]] and coloration, though not always apparent. A difference in coloration of sexes within a given species is called sexual dichromatism, which is commonly seen in many species of birds and reptiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Armenta J. K. |author2=Dunn P. O. |author3=Whittingham L. A. | year = 2008 | title = Quantifying avian sexual dichromatism: a comparison of methods | url = | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 211 | issue = 15| pages = 2423–2430 | doi=10.1242/jeb.013094 | pmid=18626076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual selection leads to the exaggerated dimorphic traits that are used predominantly in competition over mates. The increased fitness resulting from ornamentation offsets its cost to produce or maintain suggesting complex evolutionary implications, but the costs and evolutionary implications vary from species to species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zahavi A | year = 1975 | title = Mate selection-a selection for a handicap | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 53 | issue = 1| pages = 205–214 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3 | pmid=1195756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exaggerated ornamental traits are used predominantly in the competition over mates, implying [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref name="Andersson, 1994"&gt;{{harvnb|Andersson|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ornaments may be costly to produce or maintain, which has complex evolutionary implications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Amotz Zahavi]] |year=1975 |title=Mate selection&amp;nbsp;– a selection for a handicap |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=205–214 |pmid=1195756 |url=http://eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/dornhaus/courses/materials/papers/other/Zahavi%20sexual%20selection%20handicap%20model%20signal.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the costs and implications differ depending on the nature of the ornamentation (such as the colour mechanism involved).

The [[peafowl]] constitute conspicuous illustrations of the principle. The ornate [[plumage]] of peacocks, as used in the courting display, attracts [[peahen]]s. At first sight one might mistake peacocks and peahens for completely different species because of the vibrant colours and the sheer size of the male's plumage; the peahen being of a subdued brown coloration.&lt;ref name="Zi"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zi J. |author2=Yu X. |author3=Li Y. |author4=Hu X. |author5=Xu C. |author6=Wang X. |author7=Fu R. | year = 2003 | title = Coloration strategies in peacock feathers | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 22| pages = 12576–12578 | doi=10.1073/pnas.2133313100|pmid=14557541 | pmc=240659|bibcode=2003PNAS..10012576Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plumage of the peacock increases its vulnerability to predators because it is a hindrance in flight, and it renders the bird conspicuous in general.&lt;ref name="Zi" /&gt;  Similar examples are manifold, such as in [[bird-of-paradise|birds of paradise]] and [[argus (bird)|argus pheasants]].

Another example of sexual dichromatism is that of the nestling [[blue tit]]s. Males are chromatically more yellow than females. It is believed that this is obtained by the ingestion of green lepidopteran larvae, which contain large amounts of the carotenoids lutein and [[zeaxanthin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=T. | last1=Slagsvold  |first2=J. T. | last2=Lifjeld  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1985 |title=Variation in plumage colour of the Great tit ''Parus major'' in relation to habitat, season and food |journal=[[Journal of Zoology]] |volume=206 |issue=3 |pages=321–328 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1985.tb05661.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This diet also affects the sexually dimorphic colours in the human-invisible UV spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Stefan | last1=Andersson | first2=Jonas | last2=Örnborg  |first3=Malte | last3=Andersson  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1998 |title=Ultraviolet sexual dimorphism and assortative mating in blue tits |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]] |volume=265 |issue=1395 |pages=445–450 |pmc=1688915 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1998.0315}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Sarah | last1=Hunt | first2=Andrew T. D. | last2=Bennett | first3=Innes C. | last3=Cuthill | authorlink3=Innes Cuthill | first4=Richard | last4=Griffiths |year=1998 |title=Blue tits are ultraviolet tits |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]] |volume=265 |issue=1395 |pages=451–455 |jstor=50814 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1998.0316 |pmc=1688906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the male birds, although appearing yellow to humans actually have a violet-tinted plumage that is seen by females. This plumage is thought to be an indicator of male parental abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=J. C. Senar, J. Figuerola &amp; J. Pascual |year=2002 |title=Brighter yellow blue tits make better parents |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]] |volume=269 |issue=1488 |pmc=1690890 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2001.1882 |pages=257–261 |pmid=11839194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps this is a good indicator for females because it shows that they are good at obtaining a food supply from which the carotenoid is obtained. There is a positive correlation between the chromas of the tail and breast feathers and body condition.&lt;ref name="blue tits"&gt;{{cite journal |author=A. Johnsen, K. Delhey, S. Andersson &amp; B. Kempenaers |year=2003 |title=Plumage colour in nestling blue tits: sexual dichromatism, condition dependence and genetic effects |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=270 |issue=1521 |pages=1263–1270 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2375 |pmid=12816639 |pmc=1691364 |jstor=3558810 |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/270/1521/1263.full.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carotenoids play an important role in [[immune function]] for many animals, so carotenoid dependent signals might indicate health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=George A. Lozano |year=1994 |title=Carotenoids, parasites, and sexual selection |journal=[[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=309–311 |url=http://www.georgealozano.com/papers/mine/Lozano1994Carotenoids.pdf |format=PDF |jstor=3545643 |doi=10.2307/3545643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frogs constitute another conspicuous illustration of the principle. There are two types of dichromatism for frog species: ontogenetic and dynamic. Ontogenetic frogs are more common and have permanent color changes in males or females. [[Litoria lesueuri]] is an example of a dynamic frog that has temporary color changes in males during breeding season.&lt;ref&gt;Donnellan, S. C., &amp; Mahony, M. J. (2004). Allozyme, chromosomal and morphological variability in the Litoria lesueuri species group (Anura : Hylidae), including a description of a new species. Australian Journal of Zoology&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hyperolius ocellatus]] is an ontogenetic frog with dramatic differences in both color and pattern between the sexes. At sexual maturity, the males display a bright green with white dorsolateral lines.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, R. C., &amp; Zamudio, K. R. (2012). Sexual dichromatism in frogs: natural selection, sexual selection and unexpected diversity. Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the females are rusty red to silver with small spots. The bright coloration in the male population serves to attract females and as an [[Aposematism|aposematic]] sign to potential predators.

Females often show a preference for exaggerated male [[secondary sexual characteristics]] in mate selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ryan M. J. |author2=Rand S. | year = 1993 | title = Species Recognition and Sexual Selection as a Unitary Problem in Animal Communication | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 47 | issue = 2| pages = 647–657 | doi=10.2307/2410076|jstor=2410076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sexy son hypothesis explains that females prefer more elaborate males and select against males that are dull in color, independent of the species’ vision.&lt;ref name="Rubolini"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rubolini D. |author2=Spina F. |author3=Saino N. | year = 2004 | title = Protandry and sexual dimorphism in trans-Saharan migratory birds | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 592–601 | doi=10.1093/beheco/arh048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar sexual dimorphism and mating choice are also observed in many fish species. For example, male [[guppy|guppies]] have colorful spots and ornamentations while females are generally grey in color. Female guppies prefer brightly colored males to duller males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zunYrumtsR8C&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=sexuaql+dimorphism+guppies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwja5NLT16LXAhUCORoKHSw-BZEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Differences Between the Sexes|first1=R. V.|last1=Short|first2=E.|last2=Balaban|date=4 August 1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=3 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physiological differentiation===
{{expand section|date=April 2016}}
In [[Ophioblennius atlanticus|redlip blennies]], only the male fish develops an organ at the anal-urogenital region that produces antimicrobial substances. During parental care, males rub their anal-urogenital regions over their nests' internal surfaces, thereby protecting their eggs from microbial infections, one of the most common causes for mortality in young fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giacomello|first=Eva|title=A male sexually dimorphic trait provides antimicrobials to eggs in blenny fish|journal=Biology Letters|year=2006|volume=2|issue=3|pages=330–333|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2006.0492|pmid=17148395|pmc=1686180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plants==
Most flower plants are [[hermaphroditic]] but approximately 6% have separate males and females ([[dioecy]]).&lt;ref name="Renner and Ricklefs 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Renner|first=Susanne|author2=Ricklefs, Robert E |title=Dioecy and its correlates in the flowering plants|journal=American Journal of Botany|year=1995|volume=82|issue=5|pages=596–606|doi=10.2307/2445418|jstor=2445418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males and females in [[insect-pollinated]] species generally look similar to one another because plants provide rewards (e.g. [[nectar]]) that encourage [[pollinators]] to visit another similar [[flower]], completing [[pollination]]. ''[[Catasetum]]'' orchids are one interesting exception to this rule. Male ''Catasetum'' [[orchids]] violently attach [[pollinia]] to [[euglossine]] bee pollinators. The bees will then avoid other male flowers but may visit the female, which looks different from the males.&lt;ref name="Romero and Nelson 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romero|first=Gustavo|author2=Nelson, Craig E. |title=Sexual Dimorphism in Catasetum Orchids: Forcible Pollen Emplacement and Male Flower Competition|journal=Science|year=1986|volume=232|issue=4757|pages=1538–1540|bibcode = 1986Sci...232.1538R |doi = 10.1126/science.232.4757.1538|pmid=17773505|jstor=1698050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various other dioecious exceptions, such as ''[[Loxostylis alata]]'' have visibly different genders, with the effect of eliciting the most efficient behaviour from pollinators, who then use the most efficient strategy in visiting each gender of flower instead of searching say, for pollen in a nectar-bearing female flower.

Some plants, such as some species of ''[[Pollination|Geranium]]'' have what amounts to serial sexual dimorphism. The flowers of such species might for example present their anthers on opening, then shed the exhausted anthers after a day or two and perhaps change their colours as well while the pistil matures; specialist pollinators are very much inclined to concentrate on the exact appearance of the flowers they serve, which saves their time and effort and serves the interests of the plant accordingly. Some such plants go even further and change their appearance again once they have been fertilised, thereby discouraging further visits from pollinators. This is advantageous to both parties because it avoids damage to the developing fruit and avoids wasting the pollinator's effort on unrewarding visits. In effect the strategy ensures that the pollinators can expect a reward every time they visit an appropriately advertising flower.

Females of the aquatic plant ''[[Vallisneria americana]]'' have floating flowers attached by a long [[flower stalk]] that are fertilized if they contact one of the thousands of free floating flowers released by a male.&lt;ref name="Vallisneria americana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/conn.river/eelgr.html|title=Eel Grass (aka wild celery, tape grass)|website=[[University of Massachusetts]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712075849/http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/conn.river/eelgr.html|archivedate=12 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual dimorphism is most often associated with [[Pollination syndrome|wind-pollination]] in plants due to selection for efficient [[pollen]] dispersal in males vs pollen capture in females, e.g. ''Leucadendron rubrum''.&lt;ref name="Friedman and Barrett 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Jannice|author2=Barrett, Spencer |title=Wind of change: new insights on the ecology and evolution of pollination and mating in wind-pollinated plants|journal=Annals of Botany|year=2009|volume=103|pages=1515–1527|doi=10.1093/aob/mcp035|pmid=19218583|url=http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/content/103/9/1515.short|issue=9|pmc=2701749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual dimorphism in plants can also be dependent on reproductive development. This can be seen in ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'', a type of hemp, which have higher photosynthesis rates in males while growing but higher rates in females once the plants become sexually mature.&lt;ref name=Gebe99&gt;{{Cite book |last=Geber |first=Monica A. |year=1999 |title=Gender and sexual dimorphism in flowering plants |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pUo2T34ppKUC&amp;pg=PA206 |isbn=3-540-64597-7 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin }} p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

It also should be borne in mind that every sexually reproducing extant species of vascular plant actually has an alternation of generations; the plants we see about us generally are [[Ploidy|diploid]] [[sporophyte]]s, but their offspring really are not the seeds that people commonly recognise as the new generation. The seed actually is the offspring of the [[Ploidy|haploid]] generation of [[Gametophyte|microgametophytes]] ([[pollen]]) and [[Gametophyte|megagametophytes]] (the [[embryo sac]]s in the [[ovules]]). Each pollen grain accordingly may be seen as a male plant in its own right; it produces a sperm cell and is dramatically different from the female plant, the megagametophyte that produces the female gamete.

In some species, there is evidence of male dimorphism, but it appears to be for the purpose of distinctions of roles.

==Spiders and sexual cannibalism==
[[File:Male and female A. appensa.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Female (left) and male (right) ''[[Argiope appensa]]'', displaying typical sexual differences in spiders, with dramatically smaller males]]

Size dimorphism shows a correlation with [[sexual cannibalism]], which is prominent in spiders (it is also found in insects such as [[praying mantis]]es). In the size dimorphic [[wolf spider]], food-limited females cannibalize more frequently.&lt;ref name="Wilder"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wilder S. M. |author2=Rypstra A. L. | year = 2008 | title = Sexual size dimorphism mediates the occurrence of state-dependent sexual cannibalism in a wolf spider | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 76 | issue = 2| pages = 447–454 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.12.023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, there is a high risk of low fitness for males due to pre-copulatory cannibalism, which led to male selection of larger females for two reasons: higher fecundity and lower rates of cannibalism.&lt;ref name="Wilder"/&gt; In addition, female fecundity is positively correlated with female body size and large female body size is selected for, which is seen in the family [[Orb-weaver spider|Araneidae]]. All ''Argiope'' species, including ''[[Argiope bruennichi]]'', use this method. Some males evolved ornamentation{{vague|date=July 2018}} including binding the female with silk, having proportionally longer legs, modifying the female's web, mating while the female is feeding, or providing a nuptial gift in response to sexual cannibalism.&lt;ref name="Wilder"/&gt; Male body size is not under selection due to cannibalism in all spider species such as ''[[Nephila pilipes]]'', but is more prominently selected for in less dimorphic species of spiders, which often selects for larger male size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Foellmer M.

==Fish==
Ray finned fish are an ancient and diverse class, with the widest degree of sexual dimorphism of any Animal class. Fairbairn notes that "females are generally larger than males but males are often larger in species with male-male combat or male paternal care ... [sizes range] from dwarf males to males more than 12 times heavier than females"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fairbairn|first1=Daphne|title=Odd Couples: Extraordinary Differences between the Sexes in the Animal Kingdom|date=28 April 2013|publisher=Princeton|isbn=0691141967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are cases where males are substantially larger than females. An example is ''[[Lamprologus callipterus]]'', a type of cichlid fish. In this fish, the males are characterized as being up to 60 times larger than the females. The male's increased size is believed to be advantageous because males collect and defend empty snail shells in each of which a female breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kazutaka Ota, Masanori Kohda  |author2=Tetsu Sato  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010 |title=Unusual allometry for sexual size dimorphism in a cichlid where males are extremely larger than females |journal=[[Journal of Biosciences]] |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=257–265 |doi=10.1007/s12038-010-0030-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males must be larger and more powerful in order to collect the largest shells. The female's body size must remain small because in order for her to breed, she must lay her eggs inside the empty shells. If she grows too large, she will not fit in the shells and will be unable to breed. Another example is the [[dragonet]], in which males are considerably larger than females and possess longer fins.

The female's small body size is also likely beneficial to her chances of finding an unoccupied shell. Larger shells, although preferred by females, are often limited in availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Tetsu Sato |year=1994 |title=Active accumulation of spawning substrate: a determinant of extreme polygyny in a shell-brooding cichlid fish |journal=[[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]] |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=669–678 |doi=10.1006/anbe.1994.1286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the female is limited to the growth of the size of the shell and may actually change her growth rate according to shell size availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dolores Schütz  |author2=Michael Taborsky  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005 |title=Mate choice and sexual conflict in the size dimorphic water spider ''Argyroneta aquatica'' (Araneae: Argyronetidae) |journal=[[Journal of Arachnology]] |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=767–775 |doi=10.1636/S03-56.1 |url=http://www.americanarachnology.org/JoA_free/JoA_v33_n3/arac-033-03-0767.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the male's ability to collect large shells depends on his size. The larger the male, the larger the shells he is able to collect. This then allows for females to be larger in his brooding nest which makes the difference between the sizes of the sexes less substantial. Male-male competition in this fish species also selects for large size in males. There is aggressive competition by males over territory and access to larger shells. Large males win fights and steal shells from competitors. Sexual dimorphism also occurs in hermaphroditic fish. These species are known as [[sequential hermaphrodites]]. In fish, [[Life history theory|reproductive histories]] often include the sex-change from female to male where there is a strong connection between growth, the sex of an individual, and the mating system it operates within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark I. McCormick, Christopher A. Ryen, Philip L. Munday, Stefan P. W.

Social organization plays a large role in the changing of sex by the fish. It is often seen that a fish will change its sex when there is a lack of dominant male within the social hierarchy. The females that change sex are often those who attain and preserve an initial size advantage early in life. In either case, females which change sex to males are larger and often prove to be a good example of dimorphism.

In other cases with fish, males will go through noticeable changes in body size, and females will go through morphological changes that can only be seen inside of the body.  For example, in [[sockeye salmon]], males develop larger body size at maturity, including an increase in body depth, hump height, and snout length.  Females experience minor changes in snout length, but the most noticeable difference is the huge increase in gonad size, which accounts for about 25% of body mass.&lt;ref name=Secondary&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hendry|first=Andrew P.|author2=Ole K.

However, selection for ornamentation within this species suggests that showy female traits can be selected through either female-female competition or male mate choice.&lt;ref name="Amundsen"/&gt;  Since carotenoid-based ornamentation suggests mate quality, female two-spotted guppies that develop colorful orange bellies during the breeding season are considered favorable to males.&lt;ref name="Svensson"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Svensson P.

==Amphibians and non-avian reptiles==
In amphibians and reptiles, the degree of sexual dimorphism varies widely among [[taxonomic groups]]. The sexual dimorphism in amphibians and reptiles may be reflected in any of the following: anatomy; relative length of tail; relative size of head; overall size as in many species of [[viperidae|vipers]] and [[lizards]]; coloration as in many [[amphibians]], [[snakes]], and lizards, as well as in some [[turtles]]; an ornament as in many [[newts]] and lizards; the presence of specific sex-related behaviour is common to many lizards; and vocal qualities which are frequently observed in [[frogs]].

[[Anole]] lizards show prominent size dimorphism with males typically being significantly larger than females. For instance, the average male ''[[Anolis sagrei]]'' was 53.4&amp;nbsp;mm vs. 40&amp;nbsp;mm in females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Butler M.

Sexual dimorphism in birds can be manifested in size or plumage differences between the sexes. Sexual size dimorphism varies among taxa with males typically being larger, though this is not always the case, e.g. [[birds of prey]], [[hummingbird]]s, and some species of flightless birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersson|1994|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Becoming Different But Staying Alike: Patterns of Sexual Size and Shape Dimorphism in Bills of Hummingbirds|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11692-012-9206-3|journal = Evolutionary Biology|date = 2012-11-11|issn = 0071-3260|pages = 246–260|volume = 40|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s11692-012-9206-3|first = Chelsea M.|last = Berns|first2 = Dean C.|last2 = Adams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plumage dimorphism, in the form of ornamentation or coloration, also varies, though males are typically the more ornamented or brightly colored sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=K.

Sexual dimorphism is a product of both genetics and environmental factors. An example of [[sexual polymorphism]] determined by environmental conditions exists in the [[red-backed fairywren]]. Red-backed fairywren males can be classified into three categories during [[breeding season]]: black breeders, brown breeders, and brown auxiliaries.&lt;ref name="Lindsay"/&gt; These differences arise in response to the bird's body condition: if they are healthy they will produce more androgens thus becoming black breeders, while less healthy birds produce less androgens and become brown auxiliaries.&lt;ref name="Lindsay"/&gt; The reproductive success of the male is thus determined by his success during each year's non-breeding season, causing reproductive success to vary with each year's environmental conditions.

Migratory patterns and behaviors also influence sexual dimorphisms. This aspect also stems back to the size dimorphism in species. It has been shown that the larger males are better at coping with the difficulties of migration and thusly are more successful in reproducing when reaching the breeding destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rubolini | first1 = Diego | last2 = Spina | first2 = Fernando | last3 = Saino | first3 = Nicola | year = 2004 | title = Protandry and sexual dimorphism in trans-saharan migratory birds | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 592–601 | doi=10.1093/beheco/arh048}}&lt;/ref&gt; When viewing this in an evolutionary standpoint many theories and explanations come to consideration. If these are the result for every migration and breeding season the expected results should be a shift towards a larger male population through sexual selection. Sexual selection is strong when the factor of environmental selection is also introduced. The environmental selection may support a smaller chick size if those chicks were born in an area that allowed them to grow to a larger size, even though under normal conditions they would not be able to reach this optimal size for migration. When the environment gives advantages and disadvantages of this sort, the strength of selection is weakened and the environmental forces are given greater morphological weight. The sexual dimorphism could also produce a change in timing of migration leading to differences in mating success within the bird population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kissner | first1 = K. J. | last2 = Weatherhead | first2 = P. J. | last3 = Francis | first3 = C. M. | year = 2003 | title = Sexual size dimorphism and timing of spring migration in birds | url = | journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 1| pages = 154–162 | doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2003.00479.x| pmid = 14635890 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the dimorphism produces that large of a variation between the sexes and between the members of the sexes multiple evolutionary effects can take place. This timing could even lead to a speciation phenomenon if the variation becomes strongly drastic and favorable towards two different outcomes.

[[Grouse|Sexual dimorphism]] is maintained by the counteracting pressures of natural selection and sexual selection. For example, sexual dimorphism in coloration increases the vulnerability of bird species to predation by European sparrowhawks in Denmark.&lt;ref name="Moller"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Anders Pape Møller  |author2=Jan Tøttrup Nielsen  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2006 |title=Prey vulnerability in relation to sexual coloration of prey |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/5838v731471n881w/fulltext.pdf |format=PDF | journal=[[Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology]] |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=227–233 |doi=10.1007/s00265-006-0160-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably, increased sexual dimorphism means males are brighter and more conspicuous, leading to increased predation.&lt;ref name="Moller"/&gt; Moreover, the production of more exaggerated ornaments in males may come at the cost of suppressed immune function.&lt;ref name="Lindsay"/&gt; So long as the reproductive benefits of the trait due to sexual selection are greater than the costs imposed by natural selection, then the trait will propagate throughout the population. Reproductive benefits arise in the form of a larger number of offspring, while natural selection imposes costs in the form of reduced survival. This means that even if the trait causes males to die earlier, the trait is still beneficial so long as males with the trait produce more offspring than males lacking the trait. This balance keeps the dimorphism alive in these species and ensures that the next generation of successful males will also display these traits that are attractive to the females.

Such differences in form and reproductive roles often cause differences in behavior. As previously stated, males and females often have different roles in reproduction. The courtship and mating behavior of males and females are regulated largely by hormones throughout a bird's lifetime.&lt;ref name="Adkins"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elizabeth Adkins-Regan |year=2007 |title=Hormones and the development of sex differences in behavior |journal=[[Journal of Ornithology]] |volume=148 |issue=Supplement 1 |pages=S17–S26 |doi=10.1007/s10336-007-0188-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activational hormones occur during puberty and adulthood and serve to 'activate' certain behaviors when appropriate, such as territoriality during breeding season.&lt;ref name="Adkins"/&gt; Organizational hormones occur only during a critical period early in development, either just before or just after hatching in most birds, and determine patterns of behavior for the rest of the bird's life.&lt;ref name="Adkins"/&gt; Such behavioral differences can cause disproportionate sensitivities to anthropogenic pressures.&lt;ref name="Grubler"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martin U.

P. F., Short, R.V.,. (1995). Hormonal basis of sexual dimorphism in birds: Implications for new theories of sexual selection. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution., 10(REF), 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual dimorphism may also influence differences in parental investment during times of food scarcity. For example, in the [[blue-footed booby]], the female chicks grow faster than the males, resulting in booby parents producing the smaller sex, the males, during times of food shortage. This then results in the maximization of parental lifetime reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Velando|first=Alberto|title=Experimental Manipulation of Maternal Effort Produces Differential Effects in Sons and Daughters: Implications for Adaptive Sex Ratios in the Blue-footed Booby|journal=Behavioral Ecology|year=2002|volume=13|issue=4|pages=443–449|doi=10.1093/beheco/13.4.443 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual dimorphism may also only appear during mating season, some species of birds only show dimorphic traits in seasonal variation. The males of these species will molt into a less bright or less exaggerated color during the off breeding season.&lt;ref&gt;The Genetic Basis of Sexual Dimorphism in Birds

Consequently, sexual dimorphism has important ramifications for conservation. However, sexual dimorphism is not only found in birds and is thus important to the conservation of many animals. Such differences in form and behavior can lead to [[sexual segregation]], defined as sex differences in space and resource use.&lt;ref name="Main"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martin B.

Sexual dimorphism in elephant seals is associated with the ability of a male to defend territories, which correlates with polygynic behavior.

In humans, biological sex is determined by five factors present at birth: the presence or absence of a Y chromosome, the type of [[gonad]]s, the [[sex hormone]]s, the internal reproductive anatomy (such as the [[uterus]] in females), and the external genitalia.&lt;ref name="KnoxSchacht2011"&gt;Knox, David; Schacht, Caroline.

Cengage Learning; 2011-10-10 [cited 17 June 2013]. {{ISBN|9781111833220}}. p. 64–66.&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, the five factors are either all male or all female.  Sexual ambiguity is rare in humans, but wherein such ambiguity does occur, the individual is biologically classified as [[intersex]].

Sexual dimorphism among humans includes differentiation among gonads, internal genitals, external genitals, breasts, muscle mass, height, the endocrine (hormonal) systems and their physiological and behavioral effects. Human sexual differentiation is effected primarily at the gene level, by the presence or absence of a Y-chromosome, which encodes biochemical modifiers for sexual development in males.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9967/&lt;/ref&gt; According to Clark Spencer Larsen, modern day ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' show a range of sexual dimorphism, with average body mass difference between the sexes being roughly equal to 15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsen|first=Clark Spencer|title=Equality for the sexes in human evolution?

The average [[basal metabolic rate]] is about 6 percent higher in adolescent males than females and increases to about 10 percent higher after puberty. Females tend to convert more food into [[fat]], while males convert more into [[muscle]] and expendable circulating energy reserves. Aggregated data of absolute strength indicates that females have, on average, 40–60% the upper body strength of males, and 70–75% the lower body strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Strength training for female athletes: A position paper: Part 1|journal=NSCA|year=1989|volume=11|issue=4|url=http://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/Citation/1989/08000/OFFICIAL_DOCUMENT__Strength_training_for_female.6.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in strength relative to body mass is less pronounced in trained individuals.

Sexual dimorphism was also described in the gene level and shown to be extend from the sex chromosomes.  Overall, about 6500 genes have been found to have sex-differential expression in at least one tissue. Many of these genes are not directly associated with reproduction, but rather linked to more general biological features. In addition, it has been shown that genes with sex specific expression undergo reduced selection efficiency, which lead to higher population frequencies of deleterious mutations and contributing to the prevalence of several human diseases&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1186/s12915-017-0352-z|pmid=28173793|pmc=5297171|title=The landscape of sex-differential transcriptome and its consequent selection in human adults|journal=BMC Biology|volume=15|issue=1|pages=7|year=2017|last1=Gershoni|first1=Moran|last2=Pietrokovski|first2=Shmuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/ncomms5438|pmid=25014762|bibcode=2014NatCo...5E4438G|title=Reduced selection and accumulation of deleterious mutations in genes exclusively expressed in men|journal=Nature Communications|volume=5|pages=4438|last1=Gershoni|first1=Moran|last2=Pietrokovski|first2=Shmuel|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductively advantageous==
In theory, larger females are favored by competition for mates, especially in polygamous species. Larger females offer an advantage in fertility, since the physiological demands of reproduction are limiting in females. Hence there is a theoretical expectation that females tend to be larger in species that are monogamous.
Females are larger in many species of [[insect]]s, many [[spider]]s, many [[fish]], many reptiles, [[owl]]s, birds of prey and certain mammals such as the [[spotted hyena]], and baleen whales such as [[blue whale]]. As an example, in some species, females are sedentary, and so males must search for them. Fritz Vollrath and [[Geoff Parker]] argue that this difference in behaviour leads to radically different selection pressures on the two sexes, evidently favouring smaller males.&lt;ref name="vollrathparker" /&gt; Cases where the male is larger than the female have been studied as well,&lt;ref name="vollrathparker"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fritz Vollrath  |author2=Geoff A.

One example of this type of sexual size dimorphism is the bat ''[[Myotis nigricans]]'', (black myotis bat) where females are substantially larger than males in terms of body weight, skull measurement, and forearm length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=R. I. Bornholdt, L. R. Oliveira &amp; M. E.

Females bear the energetic cost of producing eggs, which is much greater than the cost of making sperm by the males. The fecundity advantage hypothesis states that a larger female is able to produce more offspring and give them more favorable conditions to ensure their survival; this is true for most ectotherms. A larger female can provide parental care for a longer time while the offspring matures. The gestation and lactation periods are fairly long in ''M. nigricans'', the females suckling their offspring until they reach nearly adult size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Virginia Hayssen |author2=T.

Smaller male size may be an adaptation to increase maneuverability and agility, allowing males to compete better with females for food and other resources.

Some species of [[anglerfish]] also display extreme sexual dimorphism. Females are more typical in appearance to other fish, whereas the males are tiny rudimentary creatures with stunted digestive systems. A male must find a female and fuse with her: he then lives parasitically, becoming little more than a sperm-producing body in what amounts to an effectively hermaphrodite composite organism. A similar situation is found in the Zeus water bug ''Phoreticovelia disparata'' where the female has a glandular area on her back that can serve to feed a male, which clings to her (note that although males can survive away from females, they generally are not free-living).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Göran Arnqvist, Therésa M.

Sexual dimorphism by size is evident in some extinct species such as the [[velociraptor]].

In 1871, [[Charles Darwin]] advanced the [[theory of sexual selection]], which related sexual dimorphism with [[sexual selection]].

It has been proposed that the earliest sexual dimorphism is the size differentiation of sperm and eggs ([[anisogamy]]), but the evolutionary significance of sexual dimorphism is more complex than that would suggest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Deborah Charlesworth]] &amp; Judith E.

This intensifies male competition for mates and promotes the evolution of other sexual dimorphism in many species, especially in [[vertebrates]] including [[mammals]]. However, in some species, the females can be larger than males, irrespective of gametes, and in some species females (usually of species in which males invest a lot in rearing offspring and thus no longer considered as so redundant) compete for mates in ways more usually associated with males.

In many non-monogamous species, the benefit to a male's reproductive fitness of mating with multiple females is large, whereas the benefit to a female's reproductive fitness of mating with multiple males is small or nonexistent.&lt;ref name="futuyma330"&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|2005|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these species, there is a [[selection pressure]] for whatever traits enable a male to have more matings. The male may therefore come to have different traits from the female.

[[File:Sumatran orangutan family in Toronto Zoo.JPG|thumb|Male (left), offspring, and female (right) Sumatran [[orangutan]]s.]]
These traits could be ones that allow him to fight off other males for control of territory or a [[Harem (zoology)|harem]], such as large size or weapons;&lt;ref name="futuyma331"&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|2005|p=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; or they could be traits that females, for whatever reason, prefer in mates.&lt;ref name="futuyma332"&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|2005|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Male-male competition]] poses no deep theoretical questions&lt;ref name="ridley328"&gt;{{harvnb|Ridley|2004|p=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[mate choice]] does.

Females may choose males that appear strong and healthy, thus likely to possess "good [[allele]]s" and give rise to healthy offspring.&lt;ref name="futuyma335"&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|2005|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some species, however, females seem to choose males with traits that do not improve offspring survival rates, and even traits that reduce it (potentially leading to traits like the peacock's tail).&lt;ref name="ridley328" /&gt; Two hypotheses for explaining this fact are the [[sexy son hypothesis]] and the [[handicap principle]].

The sexy son hypothesis states that females may initially choose a trait because it improves the survival of their young, but once this preference has become widespread, females must continue to choose the trait, even if it becomes harmful. Those that do not will have sons that are unattractive to most females (since the preference is widespread) and so receive few matings.&lt;ref name="ridley330"&gt;{{harvnb|Ridley|2004|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The handicap principle states that a male who survives despite possessing some sort of handicap thus proves that the rest of his genes are "good alleles". If males with "bad alleles" could not survive the handicap, females may evolve to choose males with this sort of handicap; the trait is acting as a hard-to-fake signal of fitness.&lt;ref name="ridley332"&gt;{{harvnb|Ridley|2004|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Şahmaran.jpg|thumb|250px|Şahmaran]]
'''Shahmaran''' ({{lang-fa|شاهماران Şahmaran|lit=Shah (king) of the Snakes}}; {{lang-ku|Şamaran}}, {{lang-tr|Şahmeran}}, {{lang-tt|Şahmara&lt;ref&gt;[[Cyrillic]]: ''Шаһмара, [[Iske imla]]:''شاهمار''&lt;/ref&gt; or Zilant, Зилант or Aq Yılan&lt;ref&gt;[[Cyrillic]]: ''Ак Елан'', [[Iske imla]]: '' آق یلان ''&lt;/ref&gt;}}, {{lang-cv|Вĕреçĕлен|lit=Fire snake}}) or ਸੱਪ ਦੇ ਸ਼ਾਹ [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]; ''Sapa dē Shaha','' is a mythical creature in [[Iran]], [[Anatolia]], [[India]] and [[Iraq]]. The name of Shahmaran comes from Persian words "[[Shah]]" and "Maran". Shah is the title for a king, primarily the leader of the Iranians and their land and "mar" means [[snake]]. In plural "Mar-an" means snakes. Shahmaran is known as the queen of the serpents. This story can be traced from the Middle East to India with different variations, one version is also found in the Arabian Night Tales as the story of Jemlia - the Sultan of Underground.&lt;ref&gt;Mardrus, 1992: Vol.7, 68-131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==

===Form and function===
The Shahmaran is often depicted as a wise, intelligent woman, having female features above the waist and those of a serpent below. She is described as the queen of the snakes. When the Shahmaran dies, it is said that her spirit will pass to her daughter. There are different versions to the legend, as follows:

Once there existed a wise snake woman, Shahmaran, who loved a traveler named Tasmasp. He was in love with her. He listened to her wisdom and stories. But when he thought she had no more stories to tell, he decided to return to his country, however he took Shahmaran with him and hid her. When Tasmasp returned to his land, the king had become very ill. One of the king's advisers exclaimed that the only way to recover was to eat Shahmaran. They took people, one by one, into the hamam to see if snake scales would come up, and when Tasmsp went, he was forced to tell where Shahmaran was hiding. When they found her, she said, "whomsoever takes a bite from my snake scales will gain the secrets of the world, but whomever takes a bite of my head will die instantly." Tasmasp took a bite of the head and the evil helper took a bite of the scales, but the helper died, and Tasmasp was not affected at all. Shahmaran had helped her lover while simultaneously killing her enemy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silkroaddance.com/detailpage.asp?ID=8439&amp;Category=Repertoire Shahmaran, Queen of Serpents] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315074802/http://www.silkroaddance.com/detailpage.asp?ID=8439&amp;Category=Repertoire |date=March 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artifolio.com/nilgunakyol/gallery/album/&amp;f_id=644 Shahmaran Series]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055756/http://www.artifolio.com/nilgunakyol/gallery/album/%26f_id%3D644 |date=September 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Turkey]], Shahmaran is believed to live in the Mediterranean town of [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]]. A similar legend is told in the [[Mardin]] region. In this region her legend is commonly evoked, with her image still depicted in embroidery, fabrics, and jewelry.

===Legend===
Thousands of years ago, there were wise snakes living in the underground. Their names in [[Iranian language|Iranian]] are ''maran'' and they are extraordinarily intelligent and caring. They live in peace. The queen of the marans is called Shahmaran. She is all-knowing, beautiful, and leads with grace. According to legend, a young wood-seller named Cemshab is the first human to see the marans. As the story goes, he is exploring a cave full of honey with friends; but they abandon him in order to take more honey. Alone, Cemshab sees an unusually light-filled hole in the back of the cave. He pulls away the rocks and finds deep within the cave is a magnificent garden. He crawl in, and is surrounded with light, flowers, and snakes. One of the snakes is coloured milky-white, Shahmaran, she is the most beautiful. He gains her trust, staying to live for many years in the underground garden. Shahmaran tells Cemshab that he was able to find her, and only him alone because of his pure heart and his [[Ajna]] (third eye), which allows him to see past the physical world and into the other worldly realm. One day after many years, he decides he would like to see his family again. So Shahmaran helps him leave, provided that he promises not to tell anyone about the maran cave. He keeps his word for many, many years. 

But one day The Sultan of land get very sick. The Vizier (the high official of the land) says that only cure is eating meat of Shahmaran, to acquire her youth and wisdom. Word gets out that Cemshab knows where to find her. He resists, but then is forced to show them the way, under the threat of pressure by the governing authority to lead them to Shahmaran or Cemshab's loved ones will be killed. Betrayed, the wise Shahmaran says to Cemshab: "make me boil in an earthenware dish. Let the sultan eat my meat and make The Vizier drink my boiled water." When that happens, the Vizier dies, and the Sultan keep living. Meanwhile, Cemshab become Vizier. 

The Morality of the story looks to Cemshab who is mesmerised by the almighty Shahmaran, and his good intentions and good heart aren't to be overlooked when his family is under duress of death. It is said that Shahmaran sent a message to Cemshab before her death, in his sleep with her highly developed consciousness to tell him that he should bring the authorities to Shahmaran's cave. She is remembered as being the peaceful queen of the snakes, with a pure heart of kindness and selflessness, and also creates the message of not to judge those who live and walk among us. Snakes have a bad and evil connotation in almost every culture, this story focuses on the ideal that “looks can be deceiving”, where although Shahmaran is a snake, she is a kind, intelligent, gentle, peaceful, beautiful and extraordinarily caring creature from beyond our own understanding and from another dimension, where only one with [[Ajna]] can actually find, meet and connect with her. 

==Popular culture==

A 1944 fairy tale book called ''The Ring of Shah Maran, A Story from the Mountains of Kurdistan'' by Raphael Emmanuel tells the folk story of a boy that shares bread with animals and earns the respect of Shahmaran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The ring of Shah Maran, a story from the mountains of Kurdistan|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/ring-of-shah-maran-a-story-from-the-mountains-of-kurdistan/oclc/5239238|website=worldcat.org|accessdate=December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2987">In [[Deaf culture]] and [[sign language]], a '''sign name''' (or a '''name sign''') is a special sign that is used to uniquely identify a person, just like a name. In the American Deaf community, there are some special cultural rules around sign names; for example, they must be agreed upon by the named person and the broader [[Deaf culture|Deaf community]]. This ensures that no one else in the community already has the same sign name or that the same sign has a different meaning. Until a person receives a sign name, the person's name is usually [[fingerspelling|fingerspelled]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/features/sign_names.shtml|title = What's your Sign Name?|date = 18 June 2008|accessdate = 26 September 2015|website = BBC – Ouch! (disability) – Features|last = Swinbourne|first = Charlie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In different cultures==
{{also|ASL name sign}}
Different deaf cultures appear to have different customs around sign names. For example, in the [[Deaf American]] community, sign names are usually subdivided into two naming systems: descriptive (DNS) and arbitrary (ANS).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Book of Name Signs|last = Supalla|first = Samuel James|publisher = DawnSignPress|year = 1992|isbn = 0915035308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNS system manually illustrates physical features, and the ANS system is the first letter of their English name applied to one or more locations. An ANS sign is usually just a unique sign without other meaning, but there may be family patterns, like all the children in a family having names signed at the chin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In [[Swedish Sign Language]] and [[French Sign Language]], it is the DNS system that dominates. In [[British Sign Language]] and [[Japanese Sign Language]], people may be named with a lexical sign for something related to them. In Japanese Sign Language, sign names for males tend to be articulated with the thumb prominent, and those for females gave the pinky tending to be prominent, corresponding to the general use of those digits in signs denoting males and females respectively.{{cn|date=March 2015}}{{cn|date=July 2015}}

The practice has a counterpart in North [[American Indian and Alaska Native|American Indian]] practices in which (spoken) names were also acquired by a personality trait, a physical feature, or especially a defining memorable event, and in which a name might also change if a still more significant occasion seemed to call for it.

The '''Silchester eagle''' is a Roman bronze casting dating from the first or second century CE, uncovered in 1866 at [[Calleva Atrebatum]] in [[Silchester]], Hampshire, England, and subsequently purchased by [[Reading Museum]] in Berkshire where it remains on display {{as of|2017|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Silchester Gallery|url=http://www.readingmuseum.org.uk/your-visit/permanent-galleries/silchester-gallery|publisher=[[Reading Museum]]|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Silchester eagle was discovered wingless and damaged in 9 October 1866 by Rev J.G. Joyce during the excavation of a Roman basilica where it was likely part of a larger statue.&lt;ref name="museum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Roman World| first=Tim|last=Cornell| first2= John| last2=Matthews|date=1991|publisher=Stonehenge|page=138| isbn=978-0867065589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Minerva| date=1996| page=28| volume=7|title=Unknown title}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It stands approximately {{convert|6|in|cm}} high and has a hollow space inside of it which was accessed through a [now missing] square lid located on the top of the back of the bird.  It was found buried in a layer of charred wood, leading the discoverer to believe that it might have been the sacred eagle of a Roman legion and been stashed in the rafters of the [[aerarium]].&lt;ref name="Association1873"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gordon Hills|journal=The Journal of the British Archaeological Association|title=Proceedings of the Association: Notes on Roman Eagles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJRYAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA184|year=1873|publisher=Brit. Arch. Ass.|pages=183–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, more recent archaeologists have suggested that the piece may have been intended as nothing more than scrap metal by the Romans at the time that it was lost, and was awaiting being recycled when the aerarium burnt down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Silchester |first=Michael |last=Fulford| journal=Current Archaeology| issue=82 |date=1981| page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2302">'''That that is is that that is not is not is that it it is''' is an English word sequence demonstrating [[syntactic ambiguity]]. It is used as an example illustrating the importance of proper [[punctuation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wieringa, Moore &amp; Barnes | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Procedure Writing: Principles and Practices | publisher = Battelle Press | year = 1993 | location = | pages = 54 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm5RAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22That+that+is+is+that+that+is+not+is+not+is+that+it+it+is%22&amp;dq=%22That+that+is+is+that+that+is+not+is+not+is+that+it+it+is%22&amp;as_brr=0&amp;pgis=1 | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-935470-68-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence can be understood as any of four grammatically-correct sequences, each with at least four discrete sentences, by adding punctuation:

{{quote|That that is, is. That that is not, is not. Is that it? It is. 
That that is, is that that is. Not is not. Is that it? It is. 

That that is, is that that is not. Is not "is that" it? It is.

That that is, is that that is not, "is not." Is that it? It is.}}

The first two relate a simple philosophical proverb in the style of [[Parmenides]] that all that is, is, and that anything that does not exist does not. The phrase was noted in ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brewer | first = Ebenezer Cobham | authorlink = Ebenezer Cobham Brewer | coauthors = | title = Dictionary of Phrase and Fable | publisher = Harper | date = 1953 | location = | pages = 896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phrase appeared in the 1968 American movie ''[[Charly]]'', written to demonstrate punctuation to the main character Charly's teacher, in a scene to demonstrate that the surgical operation to make the character smarter had succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charly (1968)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062794/|website=IMDb|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Law of Conservation of Misery''' is a [[folk wisdom]] that states that the total amount of [[wikt:misery|misery]] in a system is constant.

This implies that when you try to decrease the misery in one aspect of a system, you will increase the misery in some of the other aspects. In other words, for each problem you solve, at least one new problem is created, or as many new problems that together equal the trouble caused by the original problem. This law has particular significance in the realm of fantasy football, where one person's misery appears to correlate inversely with another person's happiness.  &lt;ref&gt;Dealing with Dilemmas, [[Frank Buytendijk]], 2010, Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|0470630310}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hertzfeld|first=Andy|title=Revolution in the valley|year=2005|publisher=O'Reilly|location=Sebastapol, Calif.|isbn=0-596-00719-1|pages=88|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Thief of Time''''' is a [[fantasy novel]] by British writer [[Terry Pratchett]], the 26th book in his ''[[Discworld]]'' series. It was the last Discworld novel with a cover by [[Josh Kirby]].

==Plot summary==
[[Auditors of Reality|The Auditors]] hire young clockmaker [[Technology of the Discworld#Jeremy Clockson|Jeremy Clockson]] to build a perfect glass clock, without telling him that this will stop time and thereby eliminate human unpredictability from the universe.  [[Death (Discworld)|Death]] discovers their plans, but cannot act against them directly, so he instead sends his granddaughter [[Susan Sto Helit]]. Meanwhile, [[Lu-Tze]] of the [[History Monks]] leads gifted young apprentice Lobsang Ludd in a desperate mission.

==Characters==
*[[Death (Discworld)|Death]] – the anthropomorphic personification of Death, or Grim Reaper, a recurring and popular character in the Discworld series.
*Jeremy Clockson – a master clockmaker tasked with creating the perfect clock (whose name is a pun on British broadcaster [[Jeremy Clarkson]].)
*Susan Sto Helit – Death's granddaughter.
*[[History Monks#Lu-Tze|Lu-Tze]] – a powerful member of the [[History Monks]] masquerading as a humble sweeper.
*[[History Monks#Lobsang Ludd|Lobsang]] Ludd – apprentice of Lu-Tze

==Reception==
''Thief of Time'' was shortlisted for the 2002 [[Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel]].&lt;ref name="WWE-2002"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At ''[[The Guardian]]'', Sam Jordison called it "as complicated, daft, hilarious and satisfying as vintage [[PG Wodehouse]]: part kung fu epic, part philosophical novel, part mind-bending experiment with chaos theory (and a piss-take of those three things)", and categorized it as a book to "give (readers) hope".&lt;ref name=Graun&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/sep/15/books-to-give-you-hope-thief-of-time-by-terry-pratchett Books to give you hope: Thief of Time by Terry Pratchett], by Sam Jordison, at ''[[the Guardian]]''; published September 15, 2016; retrieved July 10, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; At the ''[[SF Site]]'', [[Steven H Silver]] observed that the book's parodying of [[action film]]s is "masterful", and commended Pratchett for how "fresh" the humor was—while conceding that "reader(s) may not laugh out loud ... but there will be plenty of internal chuckling".&lt;ref name=Silver&gt;[https://www.sfsite.com/06b/tt106.htm Thief of Time], reviewed by [[Steven H Silver]], at the ''[[SF Site]]''; published 2001; retrieved July 10, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

At ''[[Infinity Plus]]'', [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]] noted that it has "fewer moments of uproarious humour than" the majority of Pratchett's oeuvre, and that the "narrative fails to engender any sense of urgency in the places where it should", concluding that although "one could swiftly lay hands on a dozen genre-fantasy novels that are less worthwhile", it was not Pratchett's best work.&lt;ref name=InfPlus&gt;[http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/thiefoftimehtm.htm Thief of Time by Terry Pratchett], reviewed by [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]], at ''Infinity Plus''; published June 2, 2001; retrieved July 10, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing process==

During a 2011 interview,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Life In Writing|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/14/terry-pratchett-life-writing|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pratchett discussed his process for writing, and mentioned a self-invented goddess of writers called Narrativia, whom he believed to be smiling upon him throughout his career. One example of Narrativia's intervention from ''Thief Of Time'' was the naming of a key character, Ronnie Soak, the forgotten fifth horseman of the apocalypse. Pratchett stated that he had picked the name at random, and was later "astonished when he noticed what it sounded like backwards. Suddenly, he knew of what this particular horseman would be a harbinger." In a direct quote Pratchett revealed his satisfaction with this coincidence, "I thought chaos – yes! Chaos, the oldest. Stuff just turns up like that."

The '''town drunk''' (also called a '''tavern fool''') is a [[stock character]], almost always [[male]], who is [[drunk]] more often than [[sobriety|sober]].  

== Uses in fiction ==

In fiction, the town drunk character serves a number of functions.  

* The town drunk may serve merely as a [[moral]] example and object lesson on the evils of [[drunkenness]]. This approach to the character is associated with the "[[prohibition|temperance]]" movement, and peaked at the start of the twentieth century. The notorious Prohibition play ''[[Ten Nights in a Barroom (1931 film)|Ten Nights in a Barroom]]'' portrays the inevitable fall into destitute drunkenness of a person who dared to take that "''[[The Fatal Glass of Beer (1933 film)|Fatal Glass of Beer]]''", the title of another period [[drama]] working this vein. A town drunk who appears in ''[[Our Town]]'' by [[Thornton Wilder]] is perhaps the most  often seen example of this version of the character.&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Engler, "A Project on ''Our Town'' for Communication Classes", ''College English'', Vol. 14, No. 3 (Dec., 1952), pp. 150–156&lt;/ref&gt;   Pap Finn in ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' is another famous example. In modern fiction, which tends to reflect the contemporary influences of the sobriety movement, the town drunk may get sober and set about revitalizing his life.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Richters and Dante Cicchetti, "Mark Twain Meets DSM-III-R: Conduct Disorder, Development, and the Concept of Harmful Dysfunction", in  ''Development and Psychopathology'' 5 (Cambridge, 1993), pp. 5–29&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The town drunk may play the role of the [[jester|fool]] as a source of [[comic relief]].&lt;ref&gt;P. F. Murphy, "Living by His Wits: The Buffoon and Male Survival", in ''Signs'' 2006 vol 31, num. 4, pp. 1125–1142.&lt;/ref&gt;  "[[Otis Campbell|Otis]]" from ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' is this type of town drunk, as shown in the character of [[Bobby Singer]] in the [[The CW Television Network|CW]] series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]],'' and as are many of the denizens of [[Moe's Tavern]] from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' such as [[Barney Gumble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Drug- and toxin-associated seizures | last1=Wills | first1=B| last2=Erickson | first2=T | journal=The Medical Clinics of North America | volume=89 | issue=6 | pages=1297&amp;ndash;1321 | date=Nov 2005 | pmid=16227064 | doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2005.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'', the Porter who appears in Act II, Scene 3, is also a type of "comic relief" drunk who serves to temporarily lighten the mood of the play right after a heinous [[regicide]] has taken place.
* In a similar vein, the town drunk may serve as a [[Court jester|jester]] figure, a semi-comic proxy for the [[Wise Old Man]]. He may disrupt public meetings, either for comic effect, or by dispensing what proves to be wisdom in a garbled and comic form. Or, in this incarnation, the character may introduce the [[hero]] to some of the worldlier sorts of wisdom, as well as forming a contrast to his truly heroic character. One prototype for this version of the town drunk is supplied by Shakespeare's [[Falstaff]], who appears in both parts of ''[[Henry IV, part 1|Henry IV]]'' and in ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]''. Another would be the drunk who appears in ''[[Team America: World Police]]'' at the low point of the film, where his drunken ramblings inspire the hero to save the world.

'''Unisex''' refers to things that are not [[sex-specific]], being suitable for either [[sex]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/unisex?view=uk obkaqfAskOxford: unisex&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/unisex unisex - Definitions from Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be another term for [[gender-blindness]].

The term was coined in the 1960s and was used fairly informally. Though the combining form ''uni-'' is from the Latin ''unus'' meaning ''one'', the term seems to have been influenced by words such as ''united'' and ''universal'' where the ''uni-'' prefix takes on the sense of ''shared''. In this sense, it can be seen as meaning ''shared by sexes''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutwords/unisex?view=uk AskOxford: Why does 'unisex' refer to something to do with various exes, not just one sex?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hair stylists and [[beauty salon]]s that serve both men and women are often referred to as unisex. This is also typical of other services and products that had traditionally been separated by sexes, such as clothing shops or beauty products. A facility that is usually [[sex segregated]] but is not so designated may be  referred to as unisex, such as a [[public toilet]]. [[Unisex clothing]] includes garments like T-shirts; versions of other garments may be tailored for the different fits depending on one's [[sex]], such as jeans. The sharing of a pool, beach or other water or recreational facility by swimmers and others of various sexes is commonly referred to as [[mixed bathing]]. 'Mates' was the first unisex store created by Irvine Sellar in England. When a school admits students of various sexes, it may be called coeducational or a [[mixed-sex education|mixed-sex school]].

==Derivation==
Vanity galleries are an offshoot of [[Artist-run initiative|cooperative galleries]] (also called artist-run initiatives), galleries which are operated by artists who pool their resources to pay for exhibits and publicity.  Unlike cooperative galleries, which carefully jury their members, vanity galleries will exhibit anyone who pays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Occasionally a vanity gallery will appear to have a selection process.  This is because "if every participant is promised a one- or two-person show every two years, the number of artists on the membership roster cannot exceed the available time slots for shows."&lt;ref&gt;Debora Melz (1995), "Vanities: Caveat Exhibitor" in ''Getting Exposure: The Artist's Guide to Exhibiting the Work''.  Art Calendar Publishing, Inc., p. 182. {{ISBN|0-945388-04-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial art galleries derive their profit from sales of artwork and therefore take great care to select art and artists that they believe will sell and will enhance their gallery's reputation.  They spend time and money cultivating collectors.  If the artwork sells, the gallery makes a profit, and the artist is then paid.

Vanity galleries have no incentive to sell art, as they have already been paid by the artist.  Vanity galleries are not selective because they do not have to be.  Many professional artists recommend that new artists avoid exhibiting work in them, primarily because professional critics and reviewers tend to avoid them.&lt;ref name="Gulrich"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://blogcritics.org/archives/2004/08/10/191830.php Vanity Galleries]'' by Lenny Campello, 10 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fictional ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe, the '''Vulcan nerve pinch''' is a technique used mainly by [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]]s to render unconsciousness by pinching a [[pressure point]] at the base of the victim's [[neck]].

==Origin==
[[File:Leonard Nimoy by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|right|thumb|Nimoy demonstrating the Vulcan nerve pinch.]]
[[Leonard Nimoy]], who portrayed the Vulcan science officer [[Spock]], conceived the maneuver in the early days of the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' series.&lt;ref name="Nimoy-ST.COM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/community/chat/archive/transcript/1080.html|title=Leonard Nimoy ("Spock" - TOS)|date=1999-05-13|publisher=Star Trek.com|accessdate=2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script for "[[The Enemy Within (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Enemy Within]]" stated that Spock "[[knockout|kayoes]]" &lt;!--Please do not change "kayoes" to "K. O." -- the word is a quotation from Matheson's script, and uses his spelling--please see the link directly ahead--&gt; [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]]'s duplicate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orionpressfanzines.com/articles/enemywithin.htm|title=The Enemy Within|publisher=Orion Press|accessdate=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Nimoy—who opposed the [[Vietnam War]] and supported [[Eugene McCarthy]]&lt;ref name="diehl19680825"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1968/08/25/91290697.html?pageNumber=173 | title=Girls All Want To Touch The Ears | work=The New York Times | date=1968-08-25 | accessdate=27 February 2015 | author=Diehl, Digby | pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;—felt that such a brutal action would be undignified for a Vulcan. He therefore invented an alternative by suggesting that Vulcans have the ability to project telepathic energy from their fingertips similar to "the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Mind melds|Vulcan Mind Meld]]", which, if applied to a nerve cluster correctly, could render a human unconscious. Allegedly, the director of the episode did not understand the idea when Nimoy explained it to him, but [[William Shatner]] understood immediately and reacted in exactly the way Nimoy had hoped when they executed the move during filming, explaining that it would be similar to "feeling an electrical charge." From then on, the pinch was referred to as the "FSNP", for "Famous Spock Nerve Pinch", in ''Star Trek'''s scripts.

==Use within the franchise==

Since Spock, various other characters in the ''Star Trek'' spin-offs have used the technique; however, the fact that some of these have included non-Vulcan characters creates some confusion about the above explanation as to how the nerve pinch is achieved – likely among writers and production-staff, since in the episode "[[The Omega Glory]]" Kirk tells Spock "Pity you can't teach me that" (i.e. the Vulcan Nerve Pinch), and Spock replies "I have tried, Captain." The first non-Vulcan was the [[android (robot)|android]] [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]],&lt;ref name = "Data"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Unification, Part II|episodelink=Unification (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|series=[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the [[Changeling (Star Trek)|Changeling]] [[Odo (Star Trek)|Odo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Paradise Lost|episodelink=Paradise Lost (DS9 episode)|series=[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[USS Voyager (NCC-74656)|''Voyager'']]'s [[hologram|holographic]] [[The Doctor (Star Trek)|Doctor]],&lt;ref name = "Doctor"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy|episodelink=Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy|series=[[Star Trek Voyager]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the humans [[Jean-Luc Picard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Starship Mine|episodelink=Starship Mine|series=[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seven of Nine]],&lt;ref name = "The Raven"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Raven|episodelink=The Raven (Voyager episode)|series=[[Star Trek: Voyager]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Archer]]&lt;ref name = "Archer"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Kir'Shara|episodelink=Kir'Shara|series=[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (though Archer was carrying the [[Katra (Star Trek)|''katra'']] of the ancient Vulcan [[Surak]] at the time), and [[Michael Burnham]]. In the prequel series ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' [[T'Pol]] uses it in the 4th episode of the first season ("[[Strange New World (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Strange New World]]") on [[Travis Mayweather]], to calm him down. Other examples of its use in that series include incapacitating Dr. [[Phlox (Star Trek)|Phlox]] before he can lobotomize [[Travis Mayweather]] in the 2nd season episode "[[Singularity (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Singularity]]", and again in the 3rd season episode "[[Carpenter Street (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Carpenter Street]]", on the kidnapper Loomis to stop him escaping from his apartment.

Some humans, however, have been unable to use the nerve pinch. When [[Leonard McCoy|Dr. McCoy]] was in possession of Spock's [[Katra (Star Trek)|''katra'']] he was unable to use the nerve pinch despite also being a doctor of great skill.

The nerve pinch has been used on Vulcans and the vulcanoid [[Romulan]]s several times, showing that neither race is immune to the technique.&lt;ref name = "Data"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Doctor"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "The Raven"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Archer"/&gt;

In the 2013 film ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'', Spock used the pinch on the film's villain, Khan, during their final battle. Though it appeared to cause him immense pain, it did not lead to unconsciousness, suggesting Khan and similar superhuman creations have limited tolerance to the grip—at least in the alternate universe shown in J.J. Abrams reboot films. In contrast, in the original episode "[[Space Seed]]" (and original series universe), Spock does use the Vulcan Nerve Pinch on one of Khan's henchmen, with typical results of causing instant unconsciousness, despite all indications that he was similarly superhuman. This may be seen as a difference between universes, or as a difference between Khan and that particular henchman, since they are each singular occurrences.

In the 1986 film ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'', while traveling in a [[San Francisco]] city bus, Spock used the Vulcan neck pinch to subdue a punk traveler who rudely ignored Kirk's request that he turn off his boom box as his music was causing the other travelers discomfort. This action garnered Spock applause from the relieved travelers on a bus.

The nerve pinch can also be used on non-humanoid creatures. In the [[Star Trek: the Animated Series|''Animated Series'']] episode "[[Yesteryear (Star Trek: The Animated Series)|Yesteryear]]", Spock uses the nerve pinch on a ''la matya'' during a time-travel adventure to save the life of his younger self. In the 1989 film ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'', Spock uses the pinch to subdue a horse during a battle on the planet Nimbus III.

In ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' then Commander [[Michael Burnham]], a human raised on Vulcan, used the nerve pinch to subdue Captain Philippa Georgiou during her mutiny in "The Vulcan Hello".&lt;ref&gt;"The Vulcan Hello". Star Trek Discovery, Netflix, 24/09/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use prior to the series===
[[File:Screenshot-The Aztecs Episode 2-The Warriors Of Death.png|thumb|right|[[Ian Chesterton]] using "his thumb" on Ixta.]]
In the first series [1964] ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[The Warriors of Death]]" from the story "[[The Aztecs (Doctor Who)|The Aztecs]]", [[Ian Chesterton]] holds up his thumb and boasts "This is all I need [to defeat an enemy]," and proceeds to grip the Aztec warrior Ixta between the shoulder and neck, rendering him unconscious.

==Physiology==
The pinch to the [[subclavian artery]] has been compared to the [[Knifehand strike|karate chop]], which was used in other 1960s television series' to render opponents unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;John Walsh, [http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/film-cinema/star-trek-prick-up-your-ears-1717142.html ''Star Trek'': Prick up your ears], ''Irish Independent'', April 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, fans and [[Star Trek Expanded Universe|''Star Trek'' Expanded Universe]] writers have made a number of suggestions as to how it would work.

The book ''The Making of Star Trek'' by Stephen E. Whitfield and [[Gene Roddenberry]] offers a simple explanation: the pinch blocks [[blood]] and [[nerve]] responses from reaching the [[brain]], leading to unconsciousness. How this might lead to instantaneous unconsciousness is not explained. In this earliest of ''Star Trek'' reference books, the pinch is referred to as the "Spock Pinch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitfield|first1=Steven E.|first2=Gene|last2=Roddenberry |title=The Making of Star Trek|publisher=Ballantine Books|origyear=1968|year=1970|isbn=0-345-21621-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another conjecture is that it can be done by applying strong and surgically precise pressure over [[baroreceptor]]s of the [[carotid sinus]] at the base of the humanoid neck. The objective would be to elicit the [[baroreceptor reflex]] as the receptors detect an apparent high pressure state due to the externally applied force and causes reflex [[bradycardia]] and/or [[hypotension]], leading to decreased blood supply to the brain and [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]].

A third [[conjecture]] is [[paranormal]] rather than [[medical]]: because of Vulcans' [[Telepathy (Star Trek)|telepathic]] nature and incredible control over their own bodies, they are able to send a burst of neural energy into another being and overload its [[nervous system]], rendering it unconscious.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} This was supported by the fact that Dr. McCoy could not use it in ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock|Star Trek III]]'', but it has been rendered moot by the fact that many non-telepathic characters used it in later ''Trek'' series, such as the android Data.

The canonical mechanism of the nerve pinch was finally offered in the episode "[[Cathexis (Star Trek: Voyager)|Cathexis]]" of ''Star Trek: Voyager''. There, the Doctor inspects a crewmember who was found unconscious and observes an extreme trauma to the trapezius neck bundle, "as though her nerve fibers have been ruptured"; and it is later revealed that the person was the victim of a nerve pinch.

==Death grip==
The ''Star Trek'' episode [[The Enterprise Incident|"The ''Enterprise'' Incident"]] includes a scene in which Spock administers the so-called "Vulcan death grip" to Kirk to convince [[Romulan]] onlookers, apparently unfamiliar with Vulcan techniques, that Kirk had been killed. In fact, Spock had merely used a particularly powerful nerve pinch to put Kirk into a deep unconsciousness that closely resembled death. Kirk awoke a short time later with head and neck pain, but no lasting injury. The "death grip" differs from the "nerve pinch" in that the nerve pinch is administered to the neck area, and the death grip was administered to Kirk's face; the palm directly over the nose and the fingers spread out over the rest of the face. This also differs from the "Vulcan mind meld" grip which is administered to only one side of the face. The very existence of a Vulcan "death grip" is often quickly denied by fans via a popular phrase: "There's no such thing as a Vulcan death grip" (first used by Nurse [[Christine Chapel]] in "The ''Enterprise'' Incident").
