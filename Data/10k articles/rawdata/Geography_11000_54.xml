The '''2d Space Operations Squadron''' is a unit of the [[United States Air Force]] at [[Schriever Air Force Base]], Colorado. Its mission is to manage the Navstar [[Global Positioning System]] [[satellite]] constellation for global navigation, time transfer, and nuclear detonation detection.

The [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] is augmented by [[military reserve force|reserve]] personnel from the [[19th Space Operations Squadron]], part of the [[310th Space Wing]].

==Mission==
The squadron performs the command and control mission for the [[Global Positioning System]] satellite constellation. GPS is the world's premiere space-based position, velocity and timing system, capable of providing precision navigation and timing capability simultaneously to an unlimited number of properly equipped users. Continuous GPS availability and unprecedented signal accuracy has resulted in widespread integration of the technology; numerous military, commercial and international users have embraced GPS.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' |title=The New Arms Race Threatening to Explode in Space |url=https://www.wired.com/story/new-arms-race-threatening-to-explode-in-space/ |date=June 26, 2018 |first=Garrett M. |last=Graff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The squadron was originally constituted as the '''2d Surveillance Squadron''' and activated on 16 January 1962 under [[North American Air Defense Command]]. It was then organized on 1 February 1962 at [[Ent Air Force Base]] under the [[9th Aerospace Defense Division]], under which it operated [[SPACETRACK Operations Center|SPACETRACK]], the USAF globe-spanning space surveillance network, from 1962 through 1967. The squadron was inactivated on 1 January 1967.

It was redesignated the '''2d Satellite Control Squadron''' as the first operational squadron of the [[2d Space Wing]]. It was activated at [[Falcon Air Force Station]] on 1 October 1985.

The squadron has controlled the NAVSTAR [[Global Positioning System]] satellite constellation and managed the Nuclear Detonation System in support of the [[Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] since 1987.

On 30 January 1992, as part of an Air Force reorganization, 2 SCS was redesignated the '''2d Space Operations Squadron'''.

On June 18, 2004, a 24/7 user focal point, the GPSOC, was established.

In late 2005, several [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] monitor stations were integrated into the network to improve navigation accuracy and signal monitoring.

The unit had one geographically separated unit, Detachment 1, at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], [[Florida]]. It was responsible for maintenance of a GPS Ground Antenna, Monitor Station, and various operational test assets. It is now discontinued, though contractors remained to perform the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.patrick.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123097920 |last1=Buchanan|first1=Maj John|title=Deactivation ends two decades of service on Cape Canaveral|date=May 8, 2008|publisher=45th Space Wing Public Affairs|deadurl=yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233247/http://www.patrick.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123097920 |archivedate=March 3, 2016|accessdate=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.schriever.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123097651 |author=Staff writer, no byline|title=2nd SOPS inactivates Det. 1|date=May 7, 2008|publisher=50th Space Wing Public Affairs|deadurl=yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140421053454/http://www.schriever.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123097651 |archivedate=April 21, 2014|accessdate=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amherstia''' ([[minor planet designation]]: '''516 Amherstia''') was the 8th asteroid discovered by [[Raymond Smith Dugan]], and was named after [[Amherst College]], his [[alma mater]]. Amherstia is a large [[M-type asteroid]], with an estimated diameter of 73&amp;nbsp;km. It follows an eccentric orbit between [[Jupiter]] and [[Mars]], with an orbital period of 4.39 years.

In 1989, the asteroid was observed from the [[Collurania-Teramo Observatory]], allowing a [[light curve]] to be produced that showed an estimated [[rotation period]] of 7.49 hours and a brightness variation of 0.25 ± 0.01 in [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]].&lt;ref name="Dotto1992"/&gt;

'''Antonio Lafreri''', or '''Antoine Lafréry''', also '''Antoine du Pérac Lafréry''' ([[Orgelet]], 1512 ca. - Rome, 1577), was a French [[engraving|engraver]], [[cartography|cartographer]] and publisher, active in Rome.

== Biography ==
Born in [[Franche-Comté]] ([[France]]), Lafreri settled in Rome around 1540. His most important work is the so-called [[Lafreri atlases|Atlases of Lafreri]], published in Rome in 1570, one of the first organic collection of printed maps, having on its frontespice the figure of Atlas holding the earth.&lt;ref name=tr&gt;{{cite web|title=Antonio Lafreri|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/antonio-lafreri_(Enciclopedia-Italiana)/|website=www.treccani.it|publisher=Enciclopedia Italiana|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductions of the City of Naples (cit. Miradois Palace), dated 1566, are on display at the Museum of San Martino in Naples. For the Atlas he collaborated with the most important Italian cartographers of the time: [[Giacomo Gastaldi]], [[Battista Agnese]], [[Antonio Salamanca]], Francesco Camocio the Younger, Donato Bertelli, Ferando Bertelli and Paolo Forlani.
 
In 1575 he finished the ''[[Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae]]'', a collection of 200 engravings of Rome, organized in three volumes.
 
In 2014 the [[Bavarian State Library]] bought from a private collector the Atlases of Lafrery  for 1.4 million euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The world in the 16th.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2504">The '''Australian Geography Competition''' is an Australia-wide competition run by the [[Royal Geographic Society of Queensland]] and the [[Australian Geography Teachers Association]] and sponsored by the [[National Geographic Channel]]. It tests the geographic knowledge of high school students from years 8-12. It starts with a written multiple choice test in early March. In the under 16 competition the winners from each state &amp; the territories (Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory, Cocos Islands) are taken as well as a runner up who has the highest score after these winners. These people are flown to Sydney at the start of June for a weekend of sightseeing followed by the national final. The winners go on to the [[National Geographic World Championship]] to represent Australia. The competition is also used to select the members of the Australian team for the [[International Geography Olympiad]].

The most famous{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} place in [[Brazzaville]] (the capital city of [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]]) is the '''Avenue Matsoua'''. 

It is named after one of the imperialist Congolese [[André Matsoua|Andre Grenard Matsoua]]. He was the first small [[airport]] in the last years before the [[independence of Congo]]. Located in the arrondissement 2 "Bacongo", the Avenue Matsoua is the place of demonstration of the Sapers. The place became famous in 1960, when the first Congolese students came back from [[Paris]] with beautiful clothes such as CASAKA, MPOUYOUNGOU, and CLOCHARD. Several movements of Sapologie (the science which studies Sap and plays by Sapelogue) takes place. The avenue in which several conflicts of beautiful sapers are traited by demonstrating the good clothes, and the secret of the three Colours of Sap. On his own, it shelters the Bar BABA BOUM, the Cinema Rio and the others. Many of Congolese living in [[Europe]] (specially in [[France]]) come to celebrate and to defeat others Sapers.

'''Barköl Kazak Autonomous County''' (sometimes '''Barkul''' or '''Balikul''' in English) is part of [[Kumul Prefecture]] in [[Xinjiang]] and has an area of {{convert|38445.3|km2|abbr=on}}. It forms part of the [[China–Mongolia border]] (bordering the Mongolian provinces of [[Khovd Province|Khovd]] and [[Govi-Altai Province|Govi-Altai]]) on the county's north, while bordering [[Yizhou District, Hami|Yizhou District]] to the south, [[Yiwu County]] to the east, and [[Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture|Changji]]'s [[Mori Kazakh Autonomous County]] to the west.

Barköl was made an [[autonomous county]] on October 1, 1954. It is noted for camel and horse breeding with the Barköl horse well known throughout China. Due to the large number of camels, which is unparalleled in China, the county is nicknamed of the "county of ten thousand camels".

== Lake Barkol ==
'''Lake Barkol''' is an [[Soda lake|alkali lake]] in a [[closed basin]] located at {{coord|43.668|92.803|display=inline|format=dec}}. Current rainfall averages  {{convert|210|mm}}, while the annual evaporation rate is {{convert|2,250|mm}}. Ancient shorelines show up as concentric rings on the satellite photo at right, indicating that water levels have varied many times in the past. One study identified five climates at Lake Barkol over the past 8,000 years, ranging from warm and wet to cold and wet and finally cold and dry at present. The average annual temperature in the area is now just {{convert|1|C}}, though temperatures swing from extreme highs ({{convert|33.5|C}}) to extreme lows ({{convert|-43.6|C}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=83891&amp;src=eoa-iotd Barkol Lake, Xinjiang] at Nasa  [[Earth Observatory]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''breaker''' is a piece of [[reef]] against which [[ocean surface wave|wave]]s break.

This sense of the term is closely related to another sense, that of the breaking wave itself. In times past, when ocean navigation was relatively rudimentary, a line of breaking waves was a crucial indicator that a boat was bearing down upon an [[island]] or reef. This was especially the case when sailing in darkness, in which the highly visible line of [[froth]] caused by breaking waves could be the only such indicator. In such cases the line of breakers was charted and named as a "breaker".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7457">'''Charles Warren Thornthwaite''' (March 7, 1899 – June 11, 1963) was an American [[geographer]] and [[climatologist]]. He is best known for devising a [[Climate#Thornthwaite|climate classification system]] in 1948 that is still in use worldwide, and also for his detailed water budget computations of potential [[evapotranspiration]].

He was Professor of Climatology at [[Johns Hopkins University]], adjunct professor at [[Drexel University]], President of the Commission for Climatology of the [[World Meteorological Organization]], a recipient of the Outstanding Achievement Award of the [[Association of American Geographers]], and the [[Cullum Geographical Medal]] from the [[American Geographical Society]].

==Life==
Thornthwaite was born in [[Bay City, Michigan|Bay City]], [[Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;Much of this article is derived from a [http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/chronob/THOR1899.htm chronology] by Charles H. Smith et al.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Central Michigan University |Central Michigan Normal School]], graduating in 1922. He taught at high school for the next two years in [[Owosso, Michigan]], then for the next four years he was employed as a geographer for the [[Kentucky Geological Survey]]. While there, he also became an assistant professor in the [[University of Oklahoma College of Atmospheric and Geographic Sciences|University of Oklahoma]] Department of Geography, serving there from 1927 to 1934. Meanwhile, he studied geography through the auspices of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], a student of [[Carl O. Sauer |Carl Sauer]].

In 1930 he received a Ph.D. in geography; his thesis was on "[[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]]: A Study in [[Urban Geography]]", a research project which used [[aerial photography|aerial photographs]], field observation, data analysis and detailed mapping to describe the urban geography of Louisville. He moved away from geography to climatology, but recent scholarship suggests he was nonetheless ahead of his time in his thesis project and that many of the techniques he used would later be standard procedures.&lt;ref&gt;James O. Wheeler and Stanley D. Brunn, “[http://phg.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/26/4/463 An urban geographer before his time: C. Warren Thornthwaite's 1930 doctoral dissertation]”, “Progress in Human Geography”, Vol. 26, No. 4, 463-486 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

At Central Michigan Normal School, Thornthwaite befriended John Leighly. Later, they both studied at Berkeley, with Leighly becoming his mentor. Leighly, a professor at UC Berkeley for 62 years, would write his [[obituary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://geography.berkeley.edu/peoplehistory/History/IG95_96/IG95_96.html Berkeley: The Itinerant Geographer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313014956/http://geography.berkeley.edu/peoplehistory/History/IG95_96/IG95_96.html |date=2008-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=hb767nb3z6&amp;doc.view=entire_text University of California: In Memoriam, 1986: John Leighly, Geography: Berkeley]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 Thornthwaite published “The Climates of North America: According to a New Classification”,&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Thornthwaite, “The Climates of North America: According to a New Classification”, ''Geographical Review'', Vol. 21, No. 4 (Oct., 1931), pp. 633-655&lt;/ref&gt; which launched his career as a climatologist and married the science of climatology with that of geography. In 1934, he left the [[University of Oklahoma]] to study [[internal migration]] within the United States at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

In 1935, he was appointed chief of the climatic and [[physiographic]] research division of the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service |U.S. Soil Conservation Service]] in the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]. The division ceased to function in 1942, but he remained on staff of the USDA until 1946. Included in his output from this period was the USDA technical bulletin, written with Benjamin Holzman, ''Measurement of Evaporation from Land and Water Surfaces''.&lt;ref&gt;USDA Technical Bulletin #817. 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaving government in 1946, Thornthwaite opened the Laboratory of Climatology in [[Seabrook, New Jersey|Seabrook]], [[New Jersey]], which he operated until his death in 1963. The facility continued to operate under the management of [[John Russell Mather]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wcupa.edu/LIBRARY.FHG/pdfs/John_Russell_Mather.pdf# |title=Charles P. Daly Medal recognizes UD geographer |access-date=2008-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217015910/http://www.wcupa.edu/LIBRARY.FHG/pdfs/John_Russell_Mather.pdf# |archive-date=2008-12-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his first papers would  also be his most cited: "An Approach Toward a Rational Classification of Climate" (1948).&lt;ref&gt;"An Approach Toward a Rational Classification of Climate", Geographical Review&lt;/ref&gt; This paper would be used by scientists across North America and around the world. It incorporates evapotranspiration, temperature and precipitation information and is widely used in studying animal species diversity and potential impacts of [[climate change]].

Mather shared authorship with Thornthwaite in their 1955 [[monograph]] "The Water Balance",&lt;ref&gt;"The water balance", Climatology, 8:1-104, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; which was Thornthwaite’s second major contribution to climatology, after Rational Classification. The water budget was a simple and easily used methodology for estimating water surpluses and runoff, and the difference between surpluses and runoff, to estimate the amount of water would recharge an [[aquifer]]. 

Thornthwaite was a professor of climatology at [[Johns Hopkins University]] from 1947 to 1955.

==Personal life==
Thornthwaite married Denzil Slentz in 1925. They had three daughters. When his wife died in 1962, he established the Charles Warren and Denzil Slentz Thornthwaite Memorial Scholarship Fund in her memory. The fund awards annual merit scholarships to students in [[meteorology]] and [[earth science]] at [[Central Michigan University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geo.cmich.edu/geo/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=89&amp;Itemid=66 Charles Warren and Denzil Slentz Thornthwaite Memorial Scholarship Fund]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CURAwordmark.jpeg|thumb|Center for Urban and Regional Analysis logo.]]
'''Center for Urban and Regional Analysis (CURA)''' 
The Center for Urban &amp; Regional Analysis (CURA) is an interdisciplinary research organization of [[The Ohio State University]]. CURA's mission is to serve as a bridge across academia, industry, and the policy sector by providing spatial analysis of economic, social, environmental, and health issues in urban and regional settings in Ohio and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;CURA Unit Report, July 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization explores various social, political, economic, geographic, economic, and public health issues using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and other spatial analysis techniques.  CURA also offers a speaker series which brings a wide range of speakers to campus each semester. 
== History ==
[[File:View of Derby Hall, on the Oval at Ohio State..png|thumb|222x222px|CURA is located in Derby Hall, on the Oval at Ohio State.]]
The movement for an urban center began in 1995 with a recommendation from the Committee on Applied Social and Public Policy.  Funding followed three years later in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelantern.com/2.1345/osu-one-step-closer-to-cura-1.100131#.Ud7RYvmcex0 The Lantern: "OSU One Step Closer to CURA" by Miranda Zink]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  CURA then was formed at The Ohio State University in 1999 as the Urban and Regional Analysis Initiative (URAI).  Two years later, in April 2001, the organization officially renamed itself the Center for Urban &amp; Regional Analysis and was given final approval by the Board of Trustees.  The change was announced in the University's newspaper, The Lantern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cura.osu.edu/about-cura/history{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} "The Formation of CURA" http://cura.osu.edu/about-cura/history{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization was projected to receive $240,000 per year in funding from the state of Ohio along with an additional $150,000 from the Office of Academic Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelantern.com/2.1345/osu-one-step-closer-to-cura-1.100131#.Ud7RYvmcex0 The Lantern: "OSU One Step Closer to CURA" by Miranda Zink]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

CURA has conducted extensive research and analysis on various topics such as air traffic, urban growth, land use, food accessibility, crime, housing, and data mapping through [[GIS]] technology.  It is one of just eight Ohio Urban University Program (UUP) research institutes.  The center provides a place for researchers from many fields to collaborate on critical urban issues.&lt;ref&gt;The Ohio State University College of Arts and Sciences: "Center for Urban and Regional Analysis Snapshot"[http://artsandsciences.osu.edu/cura_snapshot]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partners ===
The Center for Urban and Regional Analysis is closely associated with Ohio State's Austin E. Knowlton School of Architecture and the Geography Department but collaborates with a wide range of departments and centers at Ohio State including:&lt;ref&gt;CURA Unit Report, July 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==

=== Data Hosting ===

In June 2013, CURA, in collaboration with the [[Chadwick Arboretum]] and Learning Gardens, completed a web-based Tree Tour of Ohio State's historic Oval.  The Story Map, hosted on [[ArcGIS]].com, provides the user with a guided walking tour of 32 significant and historic trees along with information about each tree's environmental and financial benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Office of Energy and Environment: "CURA Creates Oval Digital Tree Tour" [http://oee.osu.edu/cura-creates-oval-digital-tree-tour.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cartography ===
In partnership with the Kirwan Institute of Ohio State, CURA is working to digitize Ohio's redlining maps from the 1930s.

=== Spatial Analysis ===
Ohio State's Food Innovation Center and the Mid-Ohio Foodbank are working with CURA and using GIS to find ways to increase the equity of fresh food distribution.

=== Data Visualization ===
CURA partnered with Center for Aviation Studies at OSU to create maps displaying the accessibility of domestic air service in the United States.  The maps show data for over 400 airports with an index describing the level of air service of a given region.  The project requires the continued input of data to show how the accessibility of given airports changes over time.  Graduate Affiliate Kejing Peng created a detailed web application displaying the results of the air traffic analysis.  The T100 Airport Traffic Analysis is both interactive and informative to users, providing a great deal of information on individual airports across the country.

With Ohio State's Facilities Operations and Development, CURA Graduate Associate Shaun Fontanella is planning to develop digital signs for central buildings on campus.  The signs will display and track energy consumption of each building in order to encourage decreased consumption.&lt;ref&gt;CURA Unit Report, July 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In geography and geology, a '''cliff''' is a vertical, or nearly vertical, rock exposure. Cliffs are formed as [[erosion]] landforms by the processes of [[weathering]] and erosion. Cliffs are common on coasts, in mountainous areas, [[escarpment]]s and along rivers. Cliffs are usually formed by rock that is resistant to weathering and erosion. [[Sedimentary rock]]s most likely to form cliffs include [[sandstone]], [[limestone]], [[chalk]], and [[Dolostone|dolomite]]. [[Igneous rock]]s such as [[granite]] and [[basalt]] also often form cliffs.

An [[escarpment]] (or scarp) is a type of cliff, formed by the movement of a [[geologic fault]] or landslide, or by differential erosion of rock layers of differing hardness. 

Most cliffs have some form of [[scree]] slope at their base. In arid areas or under high cliffs, they are generally exposed jumbles of fallen rock. In areas of higher moisture, a soil slope may obscure the talus. Many cliffs also feature tributary waterfalls or [[rock shelter]]s. Sometimes a cliff peters out at the end of a ridge, with [[tea table]]s or other types of rock columns remaining. Coastal erosion may lead to the formation of sea cliffs along a receding coastline.

The [[Ordnance Survey]] distinguishes between cliffs (continuous line along the top edge with projections down the face) and outcrops (continuous lines along lower edge).

== Etymology ==
Cliff comes from the Old English word ''clif'' of essentially the same meaning, cognate with Dutch, Low German, and Old Norse ''klif'' 'cliff'.&lt;ref&gt; Oxford English Dictionary, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; These may in turn all be from a [[Romance languages|Romance]] loanword into Primitive Germanic that has its origins in the Latin forms ''{{lang|la|clivus / clevus}}'' ("slope" or "hillside").&lt;ref name="Buchmüller-Pfaff "&gt;Monika Buchmüller-Pfaff: ''Namen im Grenzland - Methoden, Aspekte und Zielsetzung in der Erforschung der lothringisch-saarländischen Toponomastik'', Francia 18/1 (1991), Francia-Online: Institut historique allemand de Paris - Deutsches Historisches Institut Paris: [http://francia.digitale-sammlungen.de/Blatt_bsb00016294,00175.html Onlineressource] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129173209/http://francia.digitale-sammlungen.de/Blatt_bsb00016294,00175.html |date=2015-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pfister "&gt;Max Pfister: ''Altromanische Relikte in der östlichen und südlichen Galloromania, in den rheinischen Mundarten, im Alpenraum und in Oberitalien''.

Given that a cliff does not need to be exactly vertical, there can be ambiguity about whether a given [[Slope (land)|slope]] is a cliff or not and also about how much of a certain slope to count as a cliff. For example, given a truly vertical rock wall above a very steep slope, one could count just the rock wall or the combination. Listings of cliffs are thus inherently uncertain.

Some of the largest cliffs on Earth are found underwater. For example, an 8,000 m drop over a 4,250 m span can be found at a ridge sitting inside the [[Kermadec Trench]].

One candidate for highest cliff in the world is [[Nanga Parbat]]'s [[Rupal Face]], which rises approximately 4,600 m, or 15,000 ft, above its base. According to other sources, the highest cliff in the world, about 1,340 m high, is the east face of [[Trango Towers|Great Trango]] in the [[Karakoram]] mountains of northern Pakistan. This uses a fairly stringent notion of cliff, as the 1,340 m figure refers to a nearly vertical headwall of two stacked pillars; adding in a very steep approach brings the total drop from the East Face precipice to the nearby Dunge Glacier to nearly 2,000 m.

The location of the world's highest sea cliffs depends also on the definition of 'cliff' that is used. ''Guinness World Records'' states it is [[Kalaupapa, Hawaii]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are subject to a less stringent definition, as the average slope of these cliffs at Kaulapapa is about 1.7, corresponding to an angle of 60 degrees, and Mitre Peak is similar. A more vertical drop into the sea can be found at Maujit Qaqarssuasia (also known as the '[[Thumbnail (cliff)|Thumbnail]]') which is situated in the [[Torsukattak Strait|Torssukátak]] fjord area at the very tip of South Greenland and drops 1,560 m near-vertically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Considering a truly vertical drop, [[Mount Thor]] on [[Baffin Island]] in Arctic Canada is often considered the highest at 1370&amp;nbsp;m (4500&amp;nbsp;ft) high in total (the top 480&amp;nbsp;m (1600&amp;nbsp;ft) is overhanging), and is said to give it the longest vertical drop on Earth at 1,250 m (4,100&amp;nbsp;ft). However, other cliffs on Baffin Island, such as [[Polar Sun Spire]] in the [[Sam Ford Fjord]], or others in remote areas of Greenland may be higher.

The highest cliff in the solar system may be [[Verona Rupes]], an approximately {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} high [[fault scarp]] on [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]], a moon of Uranus.

Several big granite faces in the [[Arctic]] region vie for the title of 'highest vertical drop on Earth', but reliable measurements are not always available. The possible contenders include (measurements are approximate):

* [[Mount Thor]], [[Baffin Island]], Canada; 1,370&amp;nbsp;m (4,500&amp;nbsp;ft) total; top 480&amp;nbsp;m (1600&amp;nbsp;ft) is overhanging. This is commonly regarded as being the largest vertical drop on Earth {{citation needed|date=May 2011}} at 1,250&amp;nbsp;m (4,100&amp;nbsp;ft).

==As habitat determinants==
Cliff landforms provide unique habitat [[Niche (ecology)|niches]] to a variety of plants and animals, whose preferences and needs are suited by the vertical geometry of this landform type. For example, a number of birds have decided affinities for choosing cliff locations for nesting,&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2010.

'''Eco-labels''' and '''Green Stickers''' are labeling systems for food and consumer products.  Ecolabels are voluntary, but green stickers are mandated by law; for example, in North America major appliances and automobiles use [[Energy Star]]. They are a form of [[sustainability measurement]] directed at consumers, intended to make it easy to take environmental concerns into account when shopping. Some labels quantify pollution or energy consumption by way of index scores or units of measurement, while others assert compliance with a set of practices or minimum requirements for [[sustainability]] or reduction of harm to the environment. Many ecolabels are focused on minimising the negative [[Human impact on the environment|ecological impact]]s of [[primary production]] or [[resource extraction]] in a given sector or commodity through a set of good practices that are captured in a sustainability standard. Through a verification process, usually referred to as "certification", a farm, forest, [[fishery]], or mine can show that it complies with a standard and earn the right to sell its products as certified through the supply chain, often resulting in a consumer-facing ecolabel.

The last few years have seen two key trends in the ecolabels space. There is an explosion in the numbers of different ecolabelling programs across the world and across business sectors and secondly the proliferation of umbrella labeling programs.

Ecolabelling systems exist for both food and consumer products. Both systems were started by [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, since then the [[European Union]] have developed [[legislation]] for conduct of ecolabelling and also have created their own ecolabels, one for food and one for consumer products. At least for food, the ecolabel is nearly identical with the common NGO definition of the rules for ecolabelling. Label trust is an issue for consumers because as manufacturers and manufacturing associations have set up "rubber stamp" labels to [[greenwash]] their products with fake ecolabels. High trust levels can be created when ecolabels apply for Governmental recognition as formal Certification Marks [recognized by logos or names with 'CTM', CM or 'CertTM']. Typically this means schemes approved as a Certification Mark, have had the Government Department responsible declare that the scheme has a standard and certifies that they are 'Competent to Certify'. The highest trust levels would be a government recognized certification mark that was also compliant with key ISO standards especially ISO 14024- Type 1 Ecolabels that undertake ISO 14040 compliant life cycle analysis as part of their assessment.Type I ecolabels are voluntary labels that signify overall environmental preference of a product or services based on life-cycle considerations that address multiple environmental criteria, which are based on transparent standards for environmental preferability, verified by a qualified organization. 

==ISO Participation==
The last few years have seen two key trends in the ecolabels space. There is an explosion in the numbers of different ecolabelling programs across the world and across business sectors and secondly the proliferation of umbrella labeling programs. The International Organization for Standardization [[ISO]] has created standards for labeling practices within the [[ISO 14000]] schema. '''ISO 14020 to 14025''' series deals with environmental labels and declarations. ISO proposed three categories of environmental labels according to the aspects covered and the rigor required to award the seal: type I in ISO 14024; type II in ISO 14021; and type III in ISO 14025. Additionally, a different category called “Type I – like” is present in the literature, which represents environmental labels focused on just one environmental or social aspect; these labels have been launched by independent organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965261630854X|title=ECO-labels as a multidimensional research topic: Trends and opportunities|author=|date=1 November 2016|publisher=|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=135|pages=806–818|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=www.sciencedirect.com|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.06.167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecolabeling innovation cycle ==
There is a close relationship between the ecolabeling process and the eco-innovation because it promotes the emergence of new green products and it improves the organizations environmental management strategy. Moreover, ecolabeling process is a "cyclical eco-innovation process in which consumers, firms, governments and institutions interact. Its final purpose is to contribute to the development of sustainable and ecological ways of production and consumption. In this process, consumers’ environmental expectations are met; firms increase their created and captured value and enhance their sustainability, and governments and institutions foster cleaner production and consumption. Finally, this process is tangible in the products through the awarding of ecolabels, which are visibly displayed on goods and services".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prieto-Sandoval|first=Vanessa|last2=Alfaro|first2=José A.|last3=Mejía-Villa|first3=Andrés|last4=Ormazabal|first4=Marta|date=2016-11-01|title=ECO-labels as a multidimensional research topic: Trends and opportunities|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965261630854X|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=135|pages=806–818|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.06.167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental governance==
Consumer desires for [[sustainable consumption]] is driving the global marketplace with desire to regulate product production. The globalization of economies is shifting control of sustainability away from traditional command and control measures imposed by governments towards market governance which is a self-regulatory new environmental policy instrument, ecolabelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jordan|first=A|title=In politics, products, and markets: exploring political consumption|year=2003|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=Somerest, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horne,|first=R. E.|title=Limits to labels: The role of ecolabels in the assessment of product sustainability and routes to sustainable consumption|journal=International Journal of Consumer Studies|year=2009|volume=33|pages=175–182.|doi=10.1111/j.1470-6431.2009.00752.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only ecolabel that takes into consideration legal and infrastructural limitations is
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecoverified.com|title=Ecoverified.com Is For Sale|author=|date=|website=www.ecoverified.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a startup in Greece approved by the University of Wales and which has the Support of the Dutch Embassy and the Orange Grove.
It is a certification programme with the intention to increase owner, staff, suppliers and stakeholder’s awareness with the intention to motivate them for an eco-friendly action towards a sustainable holiday and future for all of us in the long run and through which expenses can be minimized.

Eco-labeling standardization is a new form of regulation which is voluntary in nature but impose upon large companies market forces in order to harmonize production of goods and services with stronger ecological practices. Recently, it has turned into a new form of non-state authority at both national and international levels. This idea of '''entrepreneurial democracy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lavallee|first=S.|author2=Plouffe S.|title=The eco-label and sustainable development|journal=The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment|volume=9|issue=6|pages=349–354|doi=10.1007/bf02979076}}&lt;/ref&gt;  based on the success of the ISO 14000 standards on the management of environmental quality and the ISO 9000 standards on quality production control.
Once an industry sector decides to get this certification, it has to provide evidence of documented proof of compliance required. In terms of ISO 14042 standard, it is obligatorily for all applicants to respect environmental legislation and related legislation; breaching of any laws may result in licensing suspension.

===Sustainable Initiatives===
During the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Earth Summit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/geninfo/bp/enviro.html|title=Earth_Summit|author=|date=|website=www.un.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conference in 1992, an international consensus was generated to integrate environmental issues into manufacturing procedures. The idea was to manipulate consumption patterns in order to achieve [[sustainable development]]. The result of this is as follows.

'''Currently in the''' [[Developed country|developed world]]: Eco-labels and green stickers have evolved to play a vital role. They provide a verifiable link between products and [[informed consumer]] wishes. This approach applies market pressure on industries to minimize their environmental impact; this is evidenced by the growth in the population of [[informed consumer]]s. Marketing strategists are responding with Green Certifications and its abuse, [[Greenwashing]].

'''Currently in the''' [[Developing country|developing world]]: First consumers became concerned about the quality, safety and environmental sustainability of food and supported demand for green foods, then focused on the environmental effects of agriculture and globalization of food production, which led to the exposure of globally controlled food regimes. Consumer advocate groups responded with a call for [Alternative Food Networks].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=K. |author2=Lawrence G. |author3=Richards C|title=Supermarkets’ governance of the agri-food supply chain: is the ‘corporate-environmental’ food regime evident in Australia|journal=International Journal of Society of Agriculture and Food|year=2010|volume=17|issue=2|pages=140–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives a new dimension to consumer demands and corporate competitiveness.

==History==
[[File:GreenStickerC.JPG|right|150px|Proposed International Green Sticker.]]
'''Green Stickers''' on consumer goods have been evolving since the 1970s. The main drivers have been energy and fuel consumption. These stickers first started appearing on major appliances after government agencies in the United States and Canada legislated their requirement. Manufacturers are also required to meet minimum standards of energy use. The automobile industry in North America is required to meet a minimum emissions standard. This led to [[fuel efficiency]] labels being placed on new automobiles sold. The major appliance manufacturers were required to use standard testing practices and place clear labels on products. The [[International Organization for Standardization]] has developed standards for addressing environmental labelling with the [[ISO 14000]] family which grew out of ISO's commitment to support the objective of sustainable development discussed at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, in Rio de Janeiro, in 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/management_standards/iso_9000_iso_14000/origins_and_iso_tc207.htm |title=ISO/TC 207 |publisher=ISO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Labelling worldwide is moving beyond traditional country borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eco-business.com/features/singapore-green-label-to-go-regional/|title=Singapore Green Label to go regional |publisher=eco-business.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these initiatives are voluntary Eco-labels, however, there is an initiative underway in North America to broaden the scope of Green Stickers to include other consumer goods. Although consumers tend to prefer ecolabeled products, recent research show that consumers do not fully understand ecolabels and do not fully trust ecolabels, especially when learning negative environmental consequences of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xianwen|last2=Alfnes|first2=Frode|last3=Rickertsen|first3=Kyrre|date=2017|title=Consumer Preferences, Ecolabels, and Effects of Negative Environmental Information|url=http://www.agbioforum.org/v18n3/v18n3a11-rickertsen.htm|journal=AgBioForum: The Journal of Agrobiotechnology Management &amp; Economics|volume=18|issue=3|pages=327-336|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Networks==

===GEN===
Founded in 1994, the Global Ecolabelling Network (GEN) is an international non-profit network of third party type I ecolabelling organizations focused on encouraging and promoting type I ecolabelling development worldwide. GEN has members represented from more than 50 territories and countries, with a particular focus in Europe and Asia.
GEN’s mission is to educate and encourage government, industry, and consumers to recognize the unique and important value of Type 1 ecolabelling. More specifically, GEN functions to foster cooperation and information exchange across members and ecolabelling programs, facilities access to information on ecolabelling standards, engages with international organizations to promote ecolabelling, and encourages demand for ecolabelling products through the promotion of sustainable public procurement. GEN supports its members in developing environmental leadership standards and criteria.

===ISEAL===
Created in 2002, the International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labelling Alliance (ISEAL) is a body of sustainability standard organizations set up to advance and develop sustainability standards for products across the globe. Its membership is open to all multi-stakeholder sustainability standards and accreditation bodies that demonstrate their ability to meet the ISEAL Codes of Good Practice and accompanying requirements. Its members are primarily single attribute focused ecolabelling organizations and include the Forest Stewardship Alliance, the Marine Stewardship Council, Fair Trade International, the Rainforest Alliance, and the Alliance for Water Stewardship, among many others. 

The goals of ISEAL Alliance are to improve the impacts of standards, define credibility for sustainability standards, increase the uptake of credible sustainability standards, and improve the effectiveness of standards, including driving innovations in standards.

==Programs by region==

Governments of many countries have [[Environmental Protection Agency|environmental protection agencies]]. These agencies are mandated watchdogs of industry and regulate releasing chemical pollution into the environment.  Some of them administer labelling standards; other set minimum requirements for manufacturers.

===Canada===
The Office of Energy Efficiency (OEE) run by the Department of Natural Resources Canada regulates both the automobile and appliance manufacturers.
EnerGuide label for vehicles found on all new passenger cars, light-duty vans, pickup trucks and special purpose vehicles not exceeding a gross vehicle weight of 3855&amp;nbsp;kg (8500&amp;nbsp;lb). The label shows the city and highway fuel consumption ratings and an estimated annual fuel cost for that particular vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/transportation/personal/buying/energuide-label.cfm?attr=8 |title=Fuel consumption guide |publisher=Government of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Federal law in Canada, under Canada's Energy Efficiency Regulations, requires that the EnerGuide label is placed on all new electrical appliances manufactured in or imported into Canada and that the label indicates the amount of electricity used by that appliance. This information is determined by standardized test procedures. A third-party agency verifies that an appliance meets Canada's minimum energy performance levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/residential/personal/appliances/energuide.cfm?attr=4 |title=Canada's Energy Efficiency Regulations |publisher=Government of Canada |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225164135/http://www.oee.nrcan.gc.ca/residential/personal/appliances/energuide.cfm?attr=4 |archivedate=2010-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Energy Star logo.svg|thumb|150px|right|The Energy Star service mark is placed on energy-efficient products.]]

All major home appliances must meet the Appliance Standards Program set by the US Department of Energy (DOE) on cooperation with the US Federal Trade Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/homes/rea07.shtm |title=U.S. Department of Energy, Home Appliance Regulation|publisher=Federal Trade Commission USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers must use standard test procedures developed by DOE to prove the energy use and efficiency of their products. Test results are printed on yellow EnergyGuide label, which manufacturers are required to display on many appliances. This label estimates how much energy the appliance uses, compares the energy use of similar products, and lists approximate annual operating costs. Appliances that meet strict energy efficiency criteria set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are eligible for the blue [[Energy Star]] label. The Energy Star label is also available on energy-efficient televisions, computers, audio visual equipment and electronics, office equipment, heating and cooling equipment, and many more products. Energy Star is also available on energy efficient homes and buildings in the United States.  American [[automobile]] manufacturers are required to use certified [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] test results and cannot use any other fuel mileage results to advertise vehicle fuel efficiency. The state of California has green sticker license plates issued to [[Off highway vehicle|OHV]]s is introducing green stickers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://driveclean.ca.gov/ep_label.php |title=California Air Resources Board, DRIVECLEAN.ca.gov |publisher=California Air Resources Board USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813082827/http://www.driveclean.ca.gov/ep_label.php |archivedate=2009-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for all new automobiles in 2009. The Australian based US registered Certification Mark Global GreenTag, also operates its service in the USA since 2018.

===European Union===
The [[EU Ecolabel]] was established in 1992 by the European Commission. The EU Ecolabel helps to identify products and services that have a reduced environmental impact throughout their life cycle. Recognized throughout Europe, EU Ecolabel is a voluntary label promoting environmental excellence which can be trusted. It is the only pan-European Type I official ecolabel. The EU Ecolabel is awarded according to ecological criteria agreed on by experts, industry, [[consumer organization]]s and [[environmental group|NGO]]s and verified by independent third parties. The implementation of the EU Ecolabel is set through the Regulation (EC) No 66/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council.

===Northern Europe===
The [[Nordic swan]] is the official ecolabel in Nordic countries.  It uses a system of standards, applications for licenses, and independent verification.

===ASEAN===
In Asia [[ASEAN]] is moving towards adopting the ISO's TC 207 environmental management system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asean.org/7112.htm |title=ASEAN report on environmental labelling |publisher=ASEAN |accessdate=2009-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306044647/http://www.asean.org/7112.htm |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone can contribute verifiable sources substantiating its adoption and implementation by member countries as this information is not easily accessible. The Australian Certification Mark Global GreenTag, is also formally recognised in several ASEAN countries.

===Australia===
A number of ecolabels operate in Australia and New Zealand mostly as separate schemes operating in one country only. Global GreenTag operates internationally and is recognized in both countries as is GECA whereas GECNZ operates only within NZ. All 3 ecolabels are ISO 14024 compliant. GreenTag is also an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) approved Certification Mark.

There are a plethora of sustainable seafood ecolabels, many conservationists feel that the increasing number of labels is further confusing consumers in regard to what seafood is sustainable. As of 2010, ecolabels that can be found on seafood include Marine Stewardship Council, Friend of the Sea, [[KRAV (Sweden)]], [[Naturland (Germany)]], Thai Quality Shrimp, Global Aquaculture Alliance's [[Best Aquaculture Practices]] standard, Label Rouge (France), among still others, and the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) is in development. Seafood is also labeled "organic" but [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] standards for organic seafood are still in development.

There are a variety of [[dolphin safe label]]s, asserting that tuna is caught in a manner that does not harm [[dolphin]]s.

==Energy==

{{Main article|Energy input labeling}}
Many consumer appliances have labels indicating whether or not they are energy efficient compared to similar products.  Common labels include yellow EnergyGuide tags found in North America as part of the [[Energy Star]] program, [[European Union energy label]]s, and the [[Energy Saving Trust Recommended]] logo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421100110/http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/energy_saving_products|title=Energy Saving Products - Energy Saving Trust|author=|date=21 April 2007|website=archive.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; administrated by the [[Energy Saving Trust]] in the United Kingdom.  These labels document how much energy an appliance consumes while being used; [[energy input labeling]] documents how much energy was used to ''manufacture'' the product, an additional consideration in the full life cycle energy use of product.

[[Carbon emission label]]s are an alternative methodology for certification, examining impact on [[greenhouse gas]] emissions rather than direct energy use.

'''Hacksjön''' is a small [[lake]] located east of the former airport at [[Tullinge]], in the municipality [[Botkyrka]] in southern [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. It forms the westernmost lake of one of the branches of the [[Tyresån]] [[lake system]] and is located within the [[Lida-Riksten Open-air Area]].

With its isolated location surrounded by [[moorland]]s and forests, the lake remains relatively unaffected by human activities, which is mostly limited to precipitation and incoming nutrients from local soil.  The lake is used for wireless [[radio-controlled boat]]s in summers and for [[ice racing]] in winters, which have reduced the previously prominent bird life by the lake. Notwithstanding, it is classified as of considerable importance for [[nature conservation]].&lt;ref name="Hacksjon"&gt;Hacksjön&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catchment area ==
The lake is located in a marshy moorland surrounded by forests. West of it is a former military airport today used for [[motocross]] and a [[shooting range]].
&lt;ref name="Botkyrka-Hacksjon"&gt;Sjöar i Botkyrka&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2002 key plan, the land surrounding the lake, owned by the city of Stockholm, is intended to be transformed into one of three [[nature reserve]] within the Lida-Riksten Open-air Area forming one of the important [[Green belt|green wedges]] of Stockholm.  Encompassing 240 hectares, it is marked as "conservation of rural area" and "larger area valuable for open-air life".  Additionally, the area is considered as of significant archaeological interest since it 8.000 years ago, during the [[Stone Age]], was an archipelago composed of sparsely scattered islands and thus contains many traces of the earliest settlements in Stockholm.  The area between the lake and the golf course south of it is considered as of great importance for social history since the homestead there is believed to be about 1.500 years old.&lt;ref name="inriktningsprog"&gt;Inriktningsprogram Lida-Riksten&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental influence ===
The shallow lake is moderately rich in nutrients and virtually unaffected by pollution.  Additionally, it is rich in [[humus]] which gives the water its dark brown colour.  With a [[pH]] of 7,3, the lake is unlikely to acidified.&lt;ref name="Botkyrka-Hacksjon" /&gt;

== Flora and fauna ==
[[Aquatic plant]]s thriving in the shallow lake include [[bladderwort]], [[Schoenoplectus lacustris|common club-rush]], and [[Nymphaeaceae|water lilies]].  The quagmire bordering the lake, dominated by [[Sphagnum|peat moss]] and [[Phragmites australis|reed]], also include [[Carex|sedges]], [[Epilobium palustre|marsh willowherb]], [[Galium palustre|common marsh bedstraw]], [[common mare's tail|mare's tail]], [[gypsywort]], [[Myrica gale|bog-myrtle]], [[Nymphaea alba|white water-lily]], [[Peucedanum palustre|milk parsley]], [[Potamogeton natans|broad-leaved pondweed]], [[Potentilla palustris|marsh cinquefoil]], [[grey sallow]], [[Schoenoplectus lacustris|common club-rush]], [[Sparganium|bur-reed]], [[Typha angustifolia|narrow leaf cattail]], and [[Typha latifolia|broadleaf cattail]].&lt;ref name="Botkyrka-Hacksjon" /&gt;

Open-air and motor sport activities have driven away a range of birds species once abundant by the lake, including the colony of [[black-headed gull]]s which once dominated it, other common species such as [[common pochard|pochard]], [[common teal]], [[mute swan]], [[Eurasian coot]], and more rare visitors such as [[osprey]] and [[black-throated diver]].&lt;ref name="Botkyrka-Hacksjon" /&gt;

Fry of [[smooth newt]] was reported in 2000, the only [[amphibian]] reported by the lake.  An inventory of [[damselflies]] in 1997 resulted in a list of [[emerald damselfly]], [[red-eyed damselfly]], [[variable damselfly]], [[southern hawker]], [[brilliant emerald]], [[four-spotted chaser]], [[eastern white-faced darter]], and [[Sympetrum danae|black darter]].  A second inventory in 2000 produced the following list interpreted as a normal amount of species: [[common hawker]], [[brown hawker]], [[Irish damselfly]], variable damselfly, [[downy emerald]], red-eyed damselfly, [[northern white-faced darter]], brilliant emerald, and black darter.&lt;ref name="Botkyrka-Hacksjon" /&gt;

'''Hydroelectricity''' is [[Electricity generation|electricity produced]] from [[hydropower]]. In 2015, hydropower generated 16.6% of the world's total electricity and 70% of all [[renewable energy|renewable electricity]],&lt;ref name="ren21.net"&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and was expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years.

Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the [[Asia-Pacific]] region generating 33 percent of global hydropower in 2013. [[China]] is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 920 TWh of production in 2013, representing 16.9 percent of domestic electricity use.

The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity. The hydro station consumes no water, unlike coal or gas plants. The average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 [[megawatt]]s is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per [[kilowatt-hour]].&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; With a dam and reservoir it is also a flexible source of electricity since the amount produced by the station can be changed up or down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands. Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, the project produces no direct waste, and in many cases, has a considerably lower output level of [[greenhouse gas]]es than [[fossil fuel]] powered energy plants.&lt;ref name="REN21-2011"&gt;[http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR2011_FINAL.pdf Renewables 2011 Global Status Report, page 25, Hydropower], ''[[REN21]]'', published 2011, accessed 2016-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydropower has been used since ancient times to grind flour and perform other tasks. In the mid-1770s, French engineer [[Bernard Forest de Bélidor]] published ''Architecture Hydraulique'' which described vertical- and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The old [[Robert Moses Niagara Hydroelectric Power Station#Origins|Schoelkopf Power Station No. 1]] near [[Niagara Falls]] in the U.S. side began to produce electricity in 1881. The first [[Thomas Alva Edison|Edison]] hydroelectric power station, the [[Vulcan Street Plant]], began operating September 30, 1882, in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], with an output of about 12.5 kilowatts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.clara.net/darvill/altenerg/hydro.htm|title= Hydroelectric power - energy from falling water|publisher=Clara.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1886 there were 45 hydroelectric power stations in the U.S. and Canada.

At the beginning of the 20th century, many small hydroelectric power stations were being constructed by commercial companies in mountains near metropolitan areas. [[Grenoble]], France held the [[International Exhibition of Hydropower and Tourism]] with over one million visitors. By 1920 as 40% of the power produced in the United States was hydroelectric, the [[Federal Power Act]] was enacted into law. The Act created the [[Federal Power Commission]] to regulate hydroelectric power stations on federal land and water. As the power stations became larger, their associated dams developed additional purposes to include [[flood control]], [[irrigation]] and [[navigable|navigation]]. Federal funding became necessary for large-scale development and federally owned corporations, such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (1933) and the [[Bonneville Power Administration]] (1937) were created.&lt;ref name="watenc"/&gt; Additionally, the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] which had begun a series of western U.S. irrigation projects in the early 20th century was now constructing large hydroelectric projects such as the 1928 [[Boulder Canyon Project Act|Hoover Dam]].&lt;ref name="act"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boulder Canyon Project Act|url=http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g1000/pdfiles/bcpact.pdf|date=December 21, 1928|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613142851/http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g1000/pdfiles/bcpact.pdf|archivedate=June 13, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] was also involved in hydroelectric development, completing the [[Bonneville Dam]] in 1937 and being recognized by the [[Flood Control Act of 1936]] as the premier federal flood control agency.&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;[http://www.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-pamphlets/ep870-1-29/entire.pdf The Evolution of the Flood Control Act of 1936, Joseph L.

Hydroelectric power stations continued to become larger throughout the 20th century. Hydropower was referred to as ''white coal'' for its power and plenty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Book of Knowledge|volume=Vol. 9|page=3220|edition=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hoover Dam]]'s initial 1,345 MW power station was the world's largest hydroelectric power station in 1936; it was eclipsed by the 6809 MW [[Grand Coulee Dam]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a2zlasvegas.com/otherside/sights/hoover.html|title=Hoover Dam and Lake Mead|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Reclamation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Itaipu Dam]] opened in 1984 in South America as the largest, producing 14,000 MW but was surpassed in 2008 by the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China at 22,500 MW. Hydroelectricity would eventually supply some countries, including [[Norway]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Brazil]], with over 85% of their electricity. The United States currently has over 2,000 hydroelectric power stations that supply 6.4% of its total electrical production output, which is 49% of its renewable electricity.&lt;ref name="watenc"/&gt;

==Future potential==
The technical potential for the growth of hydropower around the world are, 71% Europe, 75% North America, 79% South America, 95% Africa, 95% Middle East, 82% Asia Pacific. 
The political realities of new reservoirs in western countries, economic limitations in the third world and the lack of a transmission system in undeveloped areas, result in the possibility of developing 25% of the remaining potential before 2050, with the bulk of that being in the Asia Pacific area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/hydropower_essentials.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A few countries are highly developed and have very little room for growth, Switzerland 12% and Mexico 20%.

==Generating methods==

[[File:Water turbine - edit1.svg|thumb|A typical [[Water turbine|turbine]] and [[electrical generator|generator]]]]

===Conventional (dams)===
{{See also|List of conventional hydroelectric power stations}}

Most hydroelectric power comes from the [[potential energy]] of [[dam]]med water driving a [[water turbine]] and [[electric generator|generator]]. The power extracted from the water depends on the volume and on the difference in height between the source and the water's outflow. This height difference is called the [[head (hydraulic)|head]]. A large pipe (the "[[penstock]]") delivers water from the [[reservoir]] to the turbine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electricityforum.com/hydroelectricity.html|title=hydro electricity - explained|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pumped-storage===
{{Main article|Pumped-storage hydroelectricity}}
{{See also|List of pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations}}

This method produces electricity to supply high peak demands by moving water between [[reservoir]]s at different elevations. At times of low electrical demand, the excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the higher reservoir. When the demand becomes greater, water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine. Pumped-storage schemes currently provide the most commercially important means of large-scale [[grid energy storage]] and improve the daily [[capacity factor]] of the generation system. Pumped storage is not an energy source, and appears as a negative number in listings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesouthslope.com/content/pumped-storage-explained Pumped Storage, Explained] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231233454/http://thesouthslope.com/content/pumped-storage-explained |date=2012-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Run-of-the-river===
{{Main article|Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity}}
{{See also|List of run-of-the-river hydroelectric power stations}}

Run-of-the-river hydroelectric stations are those with small or no reservoir capacity, so that only the water coming from upstream is available for generation at that moment, and any oversupply must pass unused. A constant supply of water from a lake or existing reservoir upstream is a significant advantage in choosing sites for run-of-the-river. In the United States, run of the river hydropower could potentially provide {{convert|60000|MW}} (about 13.7% of total use in 2011 if continuously available).&lt;!--total use in 2011 was 3841 billion kWh from Annual Energy Outlook http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/er/ --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/01/run-of-the-river-hydropower-goes-with-the-flow|title=Run-of-the-River Hydropower Goes With the Flow|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tide===
{{Main article|Tide power}}
{{See also|List of tidal power stations}}

A [[tidal power]] station makes use of the daily rise and fall of ocean water due to tides; such sources are highly predictable, and if conditions permit construction of reservoirs, can also be [[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable]] to generate power during high demand periods. Less common types of hydro schemes use water's [[kinetic energy]] or undammed sources such as undershot [[water wheel]]s. Tidal power is viable in a relatively small number of locations around the world. In Great Britain, there are eight sites that could be developed, which 
have the potential to generate 20% of the electricity used in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darvill.clara.net/altenerg/tidal.htm|title=Energy Resources: Tidal power|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sizes, types and capacities of hydroelectric facilities==

=== Large facilities ===
{{See also|List of largest power stations in the world|List of largest hydroelectric power stations}}

Large-scale hydroelectric power stations are more commonly seen as the largest power producing facilities in the world, with some hydroelectric facilities capable of generating more than double the installed capacities of the current [[List of nuclear power stations|largest nuclear power stations]].

Although no official definition exists for the capacity range of large hydroelectric power stations, facilities from over a few hundred [[megawatt]]s are generally considered large hydroelectric facilities.

Currently, only four facilities over {{nowrap|10 [[Gigawatt|GW]]}} ({{nowrap|10,000 [[Megawatt|MW]]}}) are in operation worldwide, see table below.&lt;ref name=wi2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |title=Use and Capacity of Global Hydropower Increases |author=Worldwatch Institute |date=January 2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

===Small===
{{Main article|Small hydro}}

Small hydro is the development of [[hydroelectric power]] on a scale serving a small community or industrial plant. The definition of a small hydro project varies but a generating capacity of up to 10 [[megawatt]]s (MW) is generally accepted as the upper limit of what can be termed small hydro. This may be stretched to 25 MW and 30 MW in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. Small-scale hydroelectricity production grew by 29% from 2005 to 2008, raising the total world small-hydro capacity to {{nowrap|85 [[Gigawatt|GW]]}}. Over 70% of this was in [[China]] ({{nowrap|65 GW}}), followed by [[Japan]] ({{nowrap|3.5 GW}}), the United States ({{nowrap|3 GW}}), and [[India]] ({{nowrap|2 GW}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf Renewables Global Status Report 2006 Update] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718181410/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf |date=July 18, 2011 }}, ''[[REN21]]'', published 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nw vietnam hydro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A micro-hydro facility in [[Vietnam]]]]
[[File:Amateur Hydroelectricity.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Pico hydroelectricity in [[Mondulkiri]], [[Cambodia]]]]
Small hydro stations may be connected to conventional electrical distribution networks as a source of low-cost renewable energy. Alternatively, small hydro projects may be built in isolated areas that would be uneconomic to serve from a network, or in areas where there is no national electrical distribution network. Since small hydro projects usually have minimal reservoirs and civil construction work, they are seen as having a relatively low environmental impact compared to large hydro. This decreased environmental impact depends strongly on the balance between stream flow and power production.

===Micro===
{{Main article|Micro hydro}}

Micro hydro is a term used for [[hydroelectric power]] installations that typically produce up to {{nowrap|100 [[Kilowatt|kW]]}} of power. These installations can provide power to an isolated home or small community, or are sometimes connected to electric power networks. There are many of these installations around the world, particularly in developing nations as they can provide an economical source of energy without purchase of fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tve.org/ho/doc.cfm?aid=1636&amp;lang=English |title=Micro Hydro in the fight against poverty |publisher=Tve.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426092643/http://tve.org/ho/doc.cfm?aid=1636&amp;lang=English |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Micro hydro systems complement [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] solar energy systems because in many areas, water flow, and thus available hydro power, is highest in the winter when solar energy is at a minimum.

===Pico===
{{Main article|Pico hydro}}

Pico hydro is a term used for [[hydroelectric power]] generation of under {{nowrap|5 [[Kilowatt|kW]]}}. It is useful in small, remote communities that require only a small amount of electricity. For example, to power one or two fluorescent light bulbs and a TV or radio for a few homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.t4cd.org/Resources/ICT_Resources/Projects/Pages/ICTProject_287.aspx|title=Pico Hydro Power|publisher=T4cd.org|accessdate=2010-07-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731064419/http://www.t4cd.org/Resources/ICT_Resources/Projects/Pages/ICTProject_287.aspx|archivedate=2009-07-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even smaller turbines of 200-300W may power a single home in a developing country with a drop of only {{Convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. A Pico-hydro setup is typically [[#Run-of-the-river|run-of-the-river]], meaning that dams are not used, but rather pipes divert some of the flow, drop this down a gradient, and through the turbine before returning it to the stream.

===Underground===
{{Main article|Underground power station}}

An [[underground power station]] is generally used at large facilities and makes use of a large natural height difference between two waterways, such as a waterfall or mountain lake. An underground tunnel is constructed to take water from the high reservoir to the generating hall built in an underground cavern near the lowest point of the water tunnel and a horizontal tailrace taking water away to the lower outlet waterway.[[File:Tailrace-Forebay-Limestone.JPG|thumb|Measurement of the tailrace and forebay rates at the [[Limestone Generating Station]] in [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]].]]

===Calculating available power===
{{Main article|Hydropower}}
A simple formula for approximating electric power production at a hydroelectric station is: &lt;math&gt; P = \rho hrgk &lt;/math&gt;, where
*&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is Power in watts,
*&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of water (~1000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;),
*&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is height in meters,
*&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is flow rate in cubic meters per second,
*&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is acceleration due to [[gravity]] of 9.8&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,
*&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a coefficient of efficiency ranging from 0 to 1. Efficiency is often higher (that is, closer to 1) with larger and more modern turbines.

Annual electric energy production depends on the available water supply. In some installations, the water flow rate can vary by a factor of 10:1 over the course of a year.

==Properties==

===Advantages===
[[File:Stwlan.dam.jpg|thumb|The [[Ffestiniog Power Station]] can generate {{nowrap|360 [[Megawatt|MW]]}} of electricity within 60 seconds of the demand arising.]]

====Flexibility====
Hydropower is a flexible source of electricity since stations can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; Hydro turbines have a start-up time of the order of a few minutes.&lt;ref name="Huggins2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert A. Huggins|title=Energy Storage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nn5y9gQeIlwC&amp;pg=PA60|date=1 September 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-1023-3|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes around 60 to 90 seconds to bring a unit from cold start-up to full load; this is much shorter than for gas turbines or steam plants.&lt;ref name="SusskindRaseman1970"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Herbert Susskind|author2=Chad J. Raseman|title=Combined Hydroelectric Pumped Storage and Nuclear Power Generation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zbu5m1Een2sC|year=1970|publisher=Brookhaven National Laboratory|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Power generation can also be decreased quickly when there is a surplus power generation.&lt;ref name="Sørensen2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bent Sørensen|title=Renewable Energy: Its Physics, Engineering, Use, Environmental Impacts, Economy, and Planning Aspects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y17FoN2VUEwC&amp;pg=PA556|year=2004|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-656153-1|pages=556–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the limited capacity of hydropower units is not generally used to produce base power except for vacating the flood pool or meeting downstream needs.&lt;ref name="(U.S.)1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geological Survey (U.S.)|title=Geological Survey Professional Paper|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37dUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA10|year=1980|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it serves as backup for non-hydro generators.&lt;ref name="Sørensen2004" /&gt;

====Low cost/high value power====
The major advantage of conventional hydroelectric dams with reservoirs is their ability to store water at low cost for [[Dispatchable generation|dispatch later]] as high value clean electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; When used as peak power to meet demand, hydroelectricity has a higher value than base power and a much higher value compared to [[intermittent energy source]]s.

Hydroelectric stations have long economic lives, with some plants still in service after 50–100 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reme.epfl.ch/webdav/site/reme/users/106542/public/SHS4/Gr01.pdf Hydropower – A Way of Becoming Independent of Fossil Energy?]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528070938/http://reme.epfl.ch/webdav/site/reme/users/106542/public/SHS4/Gr01.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Operating labor cost is also usually low, as plants are automated and have few personnel on site during normal operation.

Where a dam serves multiple purposes, a hydroelectric station may be added with relatively low construction cost, providing a useful revenue stream to offset the costs of dam operation. It has been calculated that the sale of electricity from the [[Three Gorges Dam]] will cover the construction costs after 5 to 8 years of full generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2041318 |title=Beyond Three Gorges in China |publisher=Waterpowermagazine.com |date=2007-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614050746/http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2041318 |archivedate=2011-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some data shows that in most countries large hydropower dams will be too costly and take too long to build to deliver a positive risk adjusted return, unless appropriate risk management measures are put in place.&lt;ref&gt;(http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2406852), Should We Build More Large Dams? The Actual Costs of Hydropower Megaproject Development, Energy Policy, March 2014, pp. 1-14&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suitability for industrial applications====
While many hydroelectric projects supply public electricity networks, some are created to serve specific [[industry|industrial]] enterprises. Dedicated hydroelectric projects are often built to provide the substantial amounts of electricity needed for [[aluminium]] electrolytic plants, for example. The [[Grand Coulee Dam]] switched to support [[Alcoa]] aluminium in [[Bellingham, Washington]], [[United States]] for American [[World War II]] airplanes before it was allowed to provide irrigation and power to citizens (in addition to aluminium power) after the war. In [[Suriname]], the [[Brokopondo Reservoir]] was constructed to provide electricity for the [[Alcoa]] aluminium industry. [[New Zealand]]'s [[Manapouri Power Station]] was constructed to supply electricity to the [[aluminium]] [[smelter]] at [[Comalco|Tiwai Point]].

====Reduced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions====
Since hydroelectric dams do not use fuel, power generation does not produce [[carbon dioxide]].  While carbon dioxide is initially produced during construction of the project, and some methane is given off annually by reservoirs, hydro in specific nordic cases, has the lowest [[Greenhouse gas#Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions]] for power generation.&lt;ref&gt;Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions pg19&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to fossil fuels generating an equivalent amount of electricity, hydro displaced three billion tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/topics/renewables/subtopics/hydropower/&lt;/ref&gt; One measurement of greenhouse gas related and other externality comparison between energy sources can be found in the ExternE project by the [[Paul Scherrer Institute]] and the [[University of Stuttgart]] which was funded by the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref name="ExternEFTR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.externe.info/expoltec.pdf |title=Final Technical Report, Version 2 |author=Rabl A. et. al. |date=August 2005 |work=Externalities of Energy: Extension of Accounting Framework and Policy Applications |publisher=European Commission |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307120342/http://www.externe.info/expoltec.pdf |archivedate=March 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to that study, hydroelectricity in Europe produces the least amount of [[greenhouse gases]] and [[externality]] of any energy source.&lt;ref name="ExternEGraphs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gabe.web.psi.ch/projects/externe_pol/index.html|title=External costs of electricity systems (graph format)|year=2005|publisher=Technology Assessment / GaBE ([[Paul Scherrer Institut]])|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101201452/http://gabe.web.psi.ch/projects/externe_pol/index.html|archive-date=1 November 2013|dead-url=|work=ExternE-Pol}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming in second place was [[wind energy|wind]], third was [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], and fourth was [[solar energy|solar]] [[photovoltaic]].&lt;ref name="ExternEGraphs"/&gt; The low [[greenhouse gas]] impact of hydroelectricity is found especially in [[temperate climate]]s. The above study was for local energy in [[Europe]]; presumably similar conditions prevail in North America and Northern Asia, which all see a regular, natural freeze/thaw cycle (with associated seasonal plant decay and regrowth). Greater greenhouse gas emission impacts are found in the tropical regions because the reservoirs of power stations in tropical regions produce a larger amount of [[methane]] than those in temperate areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v4/n9/full/ngeo1226.html|title=Climate science: Renewable but not carbon-free|first=Bernhard|last=Wehrli|date=1 September 2011|publisher=|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=4|issue=9|pages=585–586|via=www.nature.com|doi=10.1038/ngeo1226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other uses of the reservoir====
Reservoirs created by hydroelectric schemes often provide facilities for [[List of water sports|water sports]], and become tourist attractions themselves. In some countries, [[aquaculture]] in reservoirs is common. [[Multipurpose reservoir|Multi-use dams]] installed for [[irrigation]] support [[agriculture]] with a relatively constant water supply. Large hydro dams can control floods, which would otherwise affect people living downstream of the project.&lt;ref name="Water: Science and Issues"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Atkins|first=William|title=Hydroelectric Power|journal=Water: Science and Issues|year=2003|volume=2|pages=187–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
{{see also|Renewable energy debate#Disadvantages of hydroelectricity}}

====Ecosystem damage and loss of land====
[[File:MeroweDam01.jpg|thumb|[[Merowe Dam]] in [[Sudan]]. Hydroelectric power stations that use [[dam]]s submerge large areas of land due to the requirement of a [[reservoir]]. These changes to land color or [[albedo]], alongside certain projects that concurrently submerge rainforests, can in these specific cases, result in the global warming impact, or equivalent [[Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|life-cycle greenhouse gases]] of hydroelectricity projects, to exceed that of coal power stations.]]

Large reservoirs associated with traditional hydroelectric power stations result in submersion of extensive areas upstream of the dams, sometimes destroying biologically rich and productive lowland and riverine valley forests, marshland and grasslands. Damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems, and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; The loss of land is often exacerbated by [[habitat fragmentation]] of surrounding areas caused by the reservoir.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Paul|title=Hydropower|journal=Encyclopedia of Environment and Society|year=2007|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydroelectric projects can be disruptive to surrounding aquatic [[ecosystem]]s both upstream and downstream of the plant site. Generation of hydroelectric power changes the downstream river environment. Water exiting a turbine usually contains very little suspended sediment, which can lead to scouring of river beds and loss of riverbanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internationalrivers.org/en/node/1476|title=Sedimentation Problems with Dams|publisher=Internationalrivers.org|accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since turbine gates are often opened intermittently, rapid or even daily fluctuations in river flow are observed.

====Water loss by evaporation====
A 2011 study by the United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory concluded that hydroelectric plants in the U.S. consumed between 1,425 and 18,000 gallons of water per megawatt-hour (gal/MWh) of electricity generated, through evaporation losses in the reservoir. The median loss was 4,491 gal/MWh, which is higher than the loss for generation technologies that use cooling towers, including concentrating solar power (865 gal/MWh for CSP trough, 786 gal/MWh for CSP tower), coal (687 gal/MWh), nuclear (672 gal/MWh), and natural gas (198 gal/MWh). Where there are multiple uses of reservoirs such as water supply, recreation, and flood control,  all reservoir evaporation is attributed to power production.&lt;ref&gt;John Macknick and others, [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/50900.pdf A Review of Operational Water Consumption and Withdrawal Factors for Electricity Generating Technologies], National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Technical Report NREL/TP-6A20-50900.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Siltation and flow shortage====
When water flows it has the ability to transport particles heavier than itself downstream. This has a negative effect on dams and subsequently their power stations, particularly those on rivers or within catchment areas with high siltation. [[Siltation]] can fill a reservoir and reduce its capacity to control floods along with causing additional horizontal pressure on the upstream portion of the dam. Eventually, some reservoirs can become full of sediment and useless or over-top during a flood and fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patrick James|first=H Chansen|title=Teaching Case Studies in Reservoir Siltation and Catchment Erosion|url=http://www.ijee.dit.ie/articles/Vol14-4/ijee1012.pdf|publisher=TEMPUS Publications|location=Great Britain|pages=265–275|year=1998|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902184753/http://www.ijee.dit.ie/articles/Vol14-4/ijee1012.pdf|archivedate=2009-09-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Șentürk|first=Fuat|title=Hydraulics of dams and reservoirs|year=1994|publisher=Water Resources Publications|location=Highlands Ranch, Colo.|isbn=0-918334-80-2|edition=reference.|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in the amount of river flow will correlate with the amount of energy produced by a dam. Lower river flows will reduce the amount of live storage in a reservoir therefore reducing the amount of water that can be used for hydroelectricity. The result of diminished river flow can be power shortages in areas that depend heavily on hydroelectric power. The risk of flow shortage may increase as a result of [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Frauke Urban and Tom Mitchell 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation Climate change, disasters and electricity generation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920024704/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation |date=September 20, 2012 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]] and [[Institute of Development Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt; One study from the [[Colorado River]] in the United States suggest that modest climate changes, such as an increase in temperature in 2 degree Celsius resulting in a 10% decline in precipitation, might reduce river run-off by up to 40%.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; [[Brazil]] in particular is vulnerable due to its heavy reliance on hydroelectricity, as increasing temperatures, lower water ﬂow and alterations in the rainfall regime, could reduce total energy production by 7% annually by the end of the century.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

====Methane emissions (from reservoirs)====
[[File:Hoover Dam Nevada Luftaufnahme.jpg|thumb|The [[Hoover Dam]] in the [[United States]] is a large conventional dammed-hydro facility, with an installed capacity of {{nowrap|2,080 [[Megawatt|MW]]}}.]]

{{See also|Environmental impacts of reservoirs}}

Lower positive impacts are found in the tropical regions, as it has been noted that the reservoirs of power plants in tropical regions produce substantial amounts of [[methane]]. This is due to plant material in flooded areas decaying in an [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] environment, and forming methane, a [[greenhouse gas]]. According to the [[World Commission on Dams]] report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dams.org/report/|title=WCD Findal Report|publisher=Dams.org|date=2000-11-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821120709/http://www.dams.org/report/|archivedate=2013-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the reservoir is large compared to the generating capacity (less than 100 watts per square metre of surface area) and no clearing of the forests in the area was undertaken prior to impoundment of the reservoir, greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoir may be higher than those of a conventional oil-fired thermal generation plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7046|title=Hydroelectric power's dirty secret revealed|publisher=Newscientist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Boreal forest|boreal]] reservoirs of Canada and Northern Europe, however, [[Greenhouse gas#Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|greenhouse gas emissions]] are typically only 2% to 8% of any kind of conventional fossil-fuel thermal generation. A new class of underwater logging operation that targets drowned forests can mitigate the effect of forest decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/2006/12/01/rediscovered-wood-the-triton-sawfish/#more-1973|title="Rediscovered" Wood &amp; The Triton Sawfish|publisher=Inhabitat|date=2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relocation====
Another disadvantage of hydroelectric dams is the need to relocate the people living where the reservoirs are planned. In 2000, the World Commission on Dams estimated that dams had physically displaced 40-80 million people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internationalrivers.org/en/way-forward/world-commission-dams/world-commission-dams-framework-brief-introduction|title=Briefing of World Commission on Dams|publisher=Internationalrivers.org|date=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Failure risks====
{{See also|Dam failure|List of hydroelectric power station failures}}

Because large conventional dammed-hydro facilities hold back large volumes of water, a failure due to poor construction, natural disasters or sabotage can be catastrophic to downriver settlements and infrastructure.

During Typhoon Nina in 1975 [[Banqiao Dam]] failed in Southern China when more than a year's worth of rain fell within 24 hours. The resulting flood resulted in the deaths of 26,000 people, and another 145,000 from epidemics. Millions were left homeless.

The creation of a dam in a geologically inappropriate location may cause disasters such as 1963 disaster at [[Vajont Dam]] in Italy, where almost 2,000 people died.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;References may be found in the list of [[Dam failure]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Malpasset Dam]] failure in [[Fréjus]] on the [[French Riviera]] (Côte d'Azur), southern France, collapsed on December 2, 1959, killing 423 people in the resulting flood.&lt;ref&gt;http://ecolo.org/documents/documents_in_french/malpasset/malpasset.htm retrieved 02sep2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller dams and [[micro hydro]] facilities create less risk, but can form continuing hazards even after being decommissioned. For example, the small earthen embankment [[Kelly Barnes Dam]] failed in 1977, twenty years after its power station was decommissioned; causing 39 deaths.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://ga.water.usgs.gov/news/historical-toccoa/ Toccoa Flood] USGS Historical Site, retrieved 02sep2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison and interactions with other methods of power generation===
Hydroelectricity eliminates the [[flue gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion]], including pollutants such as [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitric oxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], dust, and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in the [[coal]]. Hydroelectricity also avoids the hazards of [[coal mining]] and the indirect health effects of coal emissions.

====Nuclear power====

Compared to [[nuclear power]], hydroelectricity construction requires altering large areas of the environment while a nuclear power station has a small footprint, and hydro-powerstation failures have caused tens of thousands of more deaths than any nuclear station failure.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The creation of [[Garrison Dam]], for example, required Native American land to create Lake Sakakawea, which has a shoreline of 1,320 miles, and caused the inhabitants to sell 94% of their arable land for $7.5 million in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Michael L. (1982). ''Dammed Indians: the Pick-Sloan Plan and the Missouri River Sioux, 1944–1980''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, nuclear power is relatively inflexible; although nuclear power can reduce its output reasonably quickly. Since the cost of nuclear power is dominated by its high infrastructure costs, the cost per unit energy goes up significantly with low production. Because of this, nuclear power is mostly used for [[baseload]]. By way of contrast, hydroelectricity can supply peak power at much lower cost. Hydroelectricity is thus often used to complement nuclear or other sources for [[load following]]. Country examples were they are paired in a close to 50/50 share include [[Electricity sector in Switzerland|the electric grid in Switzerland]],  the [[Electricity sector in Sweden]] and to a lesser extent, [[Energy in Ukraine#Electricity|Ukraine]] and the [[Electricity sector in Finland]].

====Wind power====

[[Wind power]] goes through predictable [[Variable renewable energy|variation]] by season, but is [[Intermittent energy source|intermittent]] on a daily basis. Maximum wind generation has little relationship to peak daily electricity consumption, the wind may peak at night when power isn't needed or be still during the day when electrical demand is highest. Occasionally weather patterns can result in low wind for days or weeks at a time, a hydroelectric reservoir capable of storing weeks of output is useful to balance generation on the grid. Peak wind power can be offset by minimum hydropower and minimum wind can be offset with maximum hydropower. In this way the easily regulated character of hydroelectricity is used to compensate for the intermittent nature of wind power. Conversely, in some cases wind power can be used to spare water for later use in dry seasons.

In areas that do not have hydropower, [[pumped storage]] serves a similar role, but at a much higher cost and 20% lower efficiency. An example of this is [[Electricity sector in Norway|Norway's trading]] with [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]] and possibly [[Germany]] or the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in the future.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sintef.no/en/latest-news/norway-is-europes-cheapest-battery/&lt;/ref&gt; Norway is 98% hydropower, while it's flatland neighbors are installing wind power.

==World hydroelectric capacity==

[[File:Top 5 Hydropower-Producing Countries.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Trends in the top five hydroelectricity-producing countries]]

{{See also|List of countries by electricity production from renewable sources|Cost of electricity by source}}
{{See also|Category:Hydroelectricity by country}}

The ranking of hydro-electric capacity is either by actual annual energy production or by installed capacity power rating. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity.&lt;ref name="ren21.net"/&gt;
Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generated 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Paraguay]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Venezuela]] have a majority of the internal electric energy production from hydroelectric power. [[Paraguay]] produces 100% of its electricity from hydroelectric dams, and exports 90% of its production to Brazil and to Argentina. [[Norway]] produces 98–99% of its electricity from hydroelectric sources.&lt;ref name=norway/&gt;

A hydro-electric station rarely operates at its full power rating over a full year; the ratio between annual average power and installed capacity rating is the [[capacity factor]]. The installed capacity is the sum of all generator nameplate power ratings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2009/STAGING/local_assets/downloads/spreadsheets/statistical_review_full_report_workbook_2009.xls Consumption BP.com]{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Igbo people]] in [[Jamaica]]''' were shipped by Europeans onto the island between the 18th and 19th centuries as [[Slavery in the British and French Caribbean|enslaved]] and indentured labour on plantations. Igbo people constituted a large portion of the African population enslaved people in Jamaica. Some slave censuses detailed the large number of enslaved Igbo people on various plantations throughout the island on different dates throughout the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Africa in America: Slave Acculturation and Resistance in the American South and the British Caribbean, 1736-1831 |first=Michael |last=Mullin |publisher=University of Illinois Press |page=26 |year=1995 |isbn=0-252-06446-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=so71jZ6mHBAC&amp;pg=PA26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their presence was a large part in forming Jamaican culture, Igbo cultural influence remains in [[List of African words in Jamaican Patois#Igbo language|language]], dance, music, folklore, cuisine, religion and mannerisms.

==History==
{{Igbo people}}
Originating primarily from what was known as the [[Bight of Bonny|Bight of Biafra]] on the West African coast, Igbo people were taken in relatively high numbers to Jamaica as a result of the [[Atlantic slave trade|Transatlantic Slave Trade]], beginning around 1750. The primary ports from which the majority of these enslaved people were taken from were [[Bonny, Nigeria|Bonny]] and [[Calabar]], two port towns that are now in south-eastern Nigeria.&lt;ref name="transatlantic-his"&gt;{{cite book|title=Trans-Atlantic Dimensions of Ethnicity in the African Diaspora |first1=Paul E. |last1=Lovejoy |pages=85–86 |first2=David Vincent |last2=Trotman |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2003 |isbn=0-8264-4907-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSOyBs14tHEC&amp;pg=PA85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Slave ship|slave ships]] arriving from [[Bristol]] and [[Liverpool]] delivered the slaves to British colonies including Jamaica. The bulk of enslaved Igbo people arrived relatively late, between 1790 and 1807, when the British passed the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Abolition of the Slave Trade Act]] which outlawed the slave trade in the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Jamaican Heritage |first=Olive |last=Senior |authorlink=Olive Senior|publisher=Twin Guinep Publishers |year=2003 |isbn=976-8007-14-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jamaica, after [[History of slavery in Virginia|Virginia]], was the second most common disembarkation point for slave ships arriving from the Bight of Biafra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Murder at Montpelier: Igbo Africans in Virginia |first=Douglas B. |last=Chambers |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |pages=14, 159 |year=2009 |isbn=1-60473-246-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Igbo people were spread on plantations on the island's northwestern side, specifically the areas around [[Montego Bay]] and [[Saint Ann Parish|St. Ann's Bay]],&lt;ref name="westjam"&gt;{{cite book|title=Routes to Slavery: Direction, Ethnicity, and Mortality in the Transatlantic Slave Trade |first1=David |last1=Eltis |first2=David |last2=Richardson |publisher=Routledge |page=83 |year=1997 |isbn=0-7146-4820-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuXEzQZQmawC&amp;pg=PA83}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consequently, their influence was concentrated there. The region also witnessed a number of revolts that were attributed to people of Igbo origin. Slave owner Matthew Lewis spent time in Jamaica between 1815 and 1817 and studied the way his slaves organised themselves by ethnicity and he noted, for example, that at one time when he "went down to the negro-houses to hear the whole body of Eboes lodge a complaint against one of the book-keepers".&lt;ref name="EltisRoute"&gt;{{cite book|title=Routes to Slavery |first1=David |last1=Eltis |first2=David |last2=Richardson |publisher= |year=1997 |pages=73–74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuXEzQZQmawC&amp;pg=PA73 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Olaudah Equiano]], a prominent member of the movement for the abolition of the slave trade, was an African-born Igbo ex-slave. On one of his journeys to the Americas as a free man, as documented in his 1789 [[The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano|journal]], Equiano was hired by a Dr. Charles Irving to recruit slaves for his 1776 [[Mosquito Shore]] scheme in Jamaica, for which Equiano hired Igbo slaves, whom he called "My own countrymen". Equiano was especially useful to Irving for his knowledge of the [[Igbo language]], using Equiano as a tool to maintain social order among his Igbo slaves in Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Slavery and Abolition |first=Paul E. |last=Lovejoy |pages=15–16 |publisher=Routledge |volume=27 |issue=3 |date=December 2006 |url=http://www2.bakersfieldcollege.edu/gdumler/English%205A/Articles%20for%205A/Equiano%20Autobiography%20Memory.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Igbo slaves were known, many a times, to have resorted to resistance rather than revolt and maintained "unwritten rules of the plantation" of which the plantation owners were forced to abide by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Martha Brae's Two Histories: European Expansion and Caribbean Culture-building in Jamaica |first=Jean |last=Besson |page=43 |publisher=UNC Press Books |year=2002 |isbn=0-8078-5409-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FRaHpZbQ3wC&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Igbo culture influenced Jamaican spirituality with the introduction of [[Obeah]] folk magic; accounts of "Eboe" slaves being "obeahed" by each other have been documented by plantation owners.&lt;ref name="EltisRoute"/&gt; However, it is more likely that the word "Obeah" was also used by enslaved [[Akan people|Akan]] people, before Igbos arrived in Jamaica.&lt;ref name=rucker/&gt; Other Igbo cultural influences include the [[Jonkonnu]] festivals, Igbo words such as "unu", "una", idioms, and proverbs in [[Jamaican Patois|Jamaican patois]]. In [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroon]] music were songs derived from specific African ethnic groups, among these were songs called "Ibo" that had a distinct style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="Rock It Come Over": The Folk Music of Jamaica&lt;!--, with special reference to Kumina and the work of Mrs. Imogene "Queenie" Kennedy--&gt; |first=Olive |last=Lewin |page=156 |publisher=University of the West Indies Press |year=2000 |isbn=976-640-028-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hqFTA32bLbsC&amp;pg=PA156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Igbo people were hardly reported to have been Maroons.

Enslaved Igbo people were known to have committed mass suicides, not only for rebellion, but in the belief their spirits will return to their motherland.&lt;ref name="transatlantic-his"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Trickster Comes West: Pan-African Influence in Early Black Diasporan Narratives |first=Babacar |last=M'Baye |page=214 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=2009 |isbn=1-60473-233-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a publication of a 1791 issue of ''[[Massachusetts Magazine]]'', an anti-slavery poem was published called ''Monimba'', which depicted a fictional pregnant enslaved Igbo woman who committed suicide on a slave ship bound for Jamaica.

Archibald Monteith, whose birth name was Aneaso, was an enslaved Igbo man taken to Jamaica after being tricked by an African slave trader. Anaeso wrote a journal about his life, from when he was kidnapped from [[Igboland]] to when he became a Christian convert.&lt;ref name=aneaso&gt;{{cite book|last=Warner Lewis|first=Maureen|title=Archibald Monteath: Igbo, Jamaican, Moravian|year=2007|publisher=[[University of the West Indies Press]]|location=[[Kingston, Jamaica]]|isbn=9789766401979|pages=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|abolition of slavery]] in Jamaica in the 1830s, Igbo people also arrived on the island as [[Indentured servitude|indentured servants]] between the years of 1840 and 1864 along with a majority [[Kongo people|Kongo]] and "Nago" ([[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]) people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jamaica in Slavery and Freedom: History, Heritage and Culture |first1=Kathleen E.

===Slave rebellions and uprisings===
Enslaved Igbo people, along with "Angolas" and "Congoes" were often runaways, liberating themselves from enslavement. In slave runaway advertisements held in Jamaica workhouses in 1803 out of 1046 Africans recorded, 284 were described as "Eboes and Mocoes", 185 "Congoes", 259 "Angolas", 101 "Mandingoes", 70 [[Coromantees]], 60 "Chamba" of [[Sierra Leone]], 57 "Nagoes and Pawpaws" and 30 "scattering". 187 were documentined as "unclassified" and 488 were "American born negroes and mulattoes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Negro Slavery - A Survey of the Supply, Employment and Control of Negro Labor as Determined by the Plantation Regime |first=Ulrich Bonnell |last=Phillips |page=44 |publisher=Read Books |year=2010 |isbn=1-4455-3770-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zlZ7iT2HB2kC&amp;pg=PA44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some notable slave rebellions involving Igbo people include:

*The 1815 Igbo conspiracy in Jamaica's [[Saint Elizabeth Parish]], which involved around 250 enslaved Igbo people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Olaudah Equiano and the Igbo World: History, Society and Atlantic Diaspora Connections |first=Chima Jacob |last=Korieh |publisher=Africa World Press |page=364 |year=2009 |isbn=1-59221-664-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; described as one of the revolts that contributed to a climate for [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=African Voices of the Atlantic Slave Trade: Beyond the Silence and the Shame |first=Anne Caroline |last=Bailey |page=98 |publisher=Beacon Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-8070-5512-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YrIjNMu5_vsC&amp;pg=PA98}}&lt;/ref&gt; A letter by the Governor of [[Manchester Parish]] to Bathurst on April 13, 1816,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Documents on British West Indian History, 1807-1833 |author=[[Eric Eustace Williams]] |publisher=Trinidad Pub. Co |year=1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; quoted the leaders of the rebellion on trial as saying "that 'he had all the Eboes in his hand', meaning to insinuate that all the Negroes from that Country were under his controul".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Slaves who Abolished Slavery: Blacks in Rebellion |first=Richard |last=Hart |authorlink=Richard Hart (Jamaican historian and politician)|page=226 |publisher=University of the West Indies Press |year=2002 |isbn=976-640-110-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot was thwarted and several slaves were executed.

*The 1816 [[Black River, Jamaica|Black River]] rebellion plot, was according to Lewis (1834:227—28), carried out by only people of "Eboe" origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Afro-Creole: Power, Opposition, and Play in the Caribbean |first=Richard D. E. |last=Burton |page=84 |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-8014-8325-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O06PhHXMJM0C&amp;pg=PA84}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plot was uncovered on March 22, 1816, by a novelist and absentee planter named Matthew Gregory "Monk" Lewis. Lewis recorded what Hayward (1985) called a proto-[[Calypso music|Calypso]] revolutionary hymn, sung by a group of Igbo slaves, led by the "King of the Eboes". They sang:&lt;blockquote&gt;Oh me Good friend, Mr. Wilberforce, make we free!&lt;br/&gt;God Almighty thank ye! God Almighty thank ye!&lt;br/&gt;God Almighty, make we free!&lt;br/&gt;Buckra in this country no make we free:&lt;br/&gt;What Negro for to do? What Negro for to do?&lt;br/&gt;Take force by force!

:"Mr. Wilberforce" was in reference to [[William Wilberforce]] a British politician wo was a leader of the movement to abolish the slave trade. "Buckra" was a term introduced by Igbo and [[Efik people|Efik]] slaves in Jamaica to refer to [[white people|white]] slave owners and overseers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hog &amp; Hominy: Soul Food from Africa to America |first=Frederick Douglass |last=Opie |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2008 |page=17 |isbn=0-231-14638-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lAl8f11qngC&amp;pg=PA17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Among Igbo cultural items in Jamaica were the Eboe, or Ibo drums popular throughout all of Jamaican music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jamaica the Culture |first=Amber |last=Wilson |page=22 |publisher=Crabtree Publishing Company |year=2004 |isbn=0-7787-9332-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food was also influenced, for example the Igbo word "mba" meaning "yam root" was used to describe a type of [[yam (vegetable)|yam]] in Jamaica called "himba".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=English: History, Diversity, and Change |first1=David |last1=Graddol |first2=Dick |last2=Leith |first3=Joan |last3=Swann |page=210 |publisher=Routledge |year=1996 |isbn=0-415-13117-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=African Continuities in the Linguistic Heritage of Jamaica |first=Maureen Warner |last=Lewis |publisher=African Caribbean Institute of Jamaica |page=24 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Igbo and Akan slaves affected drinking culture among the black population in Jamaica, using alcohol in ritual and libation. In Igboland as well as on the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]], [[palm wine]] was used on these occasions and had to be substituted by [[rum]] in Jamaica because of the absence of palm wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Drinking: Anthropological Approaches |first1=I. de |last1=Garine |first2=Valérie de |last2=Garine |publisher=Berghahn Books |pages=221–222 |year=2001 |isbn=1-57181-809-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PdCJjFrxMewC&amp;pg=PA222}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonkonnu]], a parade that is held in many West Indian nations, has been attributed to the [[Njoku Ji]] "yam-spirit cult", Okonko and [[Ekpe]] of the Igbo. Several masquerades of the [[Kalabari people|Kalabari]] and Igbo have similar appearance to those of Jonkonnu masquerades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Murder at Montpelier |first=Douglas B. |last=Chambers |page=182 |date= 2005 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
Much of Jamaican mannerisms and gestures themselves have a wider African origin, rather than specific Igbo origin. Some examples are non-verbal actions such as "[[sucking-teeth]]" known in Igbo as "ima osu" or "imu oso" and "cutting-eye" known in Igbo as "iro anya", and other non-verbal communications by eye movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jamaica in Slavery and Freedom: History, Heritage and Culture |first1=Kathleen E.

There are a few Igbo words in Jamaican Patois that resulted when slaves were restricted from speaking their own languages. These Igbo words still exist in Jamaican vernacular, including words such as "unu" meaning "you (plural)",&lt;ref name="Cassidy2002" /&gt; "di" meaning "to be (in state of)", which became "de", and "Okwuru" "Okra" a vegetable.&lt;ref name="McWhorter 2000"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Missing Spanish Creoles: Recovering the Birth of Plantation Contact Languages | first=John H. | last=McWhorter| isbn=0-520-21999-6 |page=128 | publisher=University of California Press | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some words of Igbo origin are
* "akara", from "''àkàrà"'', type of food, also from Ewe and Yoruba;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cassidy|2002|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* "attoo", from "''átú" meaning'' "chewing stick".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cassidy|2002|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Idiom such as, via [[Gullah language|Gullah]] "big eye" from Igbo "anya ukwu" meaning "greedy";&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cassidy|2002|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Holloway|2005|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bartens|2003|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "de", from "''dị"'' [with adverbial] "is" ''(to be)'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|2000|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rickford|Romain|Sato|1999|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* unu" or "una" from "''únù"'' meaning "you (plural)"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cassidy|2002|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proverbs===

''"Ilu"'' in Igbo means proverbs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Of Minstrelsy and Masks: The Legacy of Ezenwa-Ohaeto in Nigerian Writing |editor-first1=Christine |editor-last1=Matzke  |publisher=Rodopi |page=147 |year=2006 |isbn=90-420-2168-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W_RQNoVnMPoC&amp;pg=PA147}}&lt;/ref&gt; a part of language that is very important to the Igbo. Igbo proverbs crossed the Atlantic along with the masses of enslaved Igbo people. Several translated Igbo proverbs survive in Jamaica today because of the Igbo ancestors. Some of these include:
*'''Igbo''': "He who will swallow udala seeds must consider the size of his anus"
:'''Jamaican''': "Cow must know 'ow 'im bottom stay before 'im swallow abbe [Twi 'palm nut'] seed"; "Jonkro must know what 'im a do before 'im swallow abbe seed."
* '''Igbo''': "Where are the young suckers that will grow when the old banana tree dies?"
:'''Jamaican''' "When plantain wan' dead, it shoot [sends out new suckers]."
* '''Igbo''': "A man who makes trouble for other is also making one for himself."
:'''Jamaican''': "When you dig a hole/ditch for one, dig two."
* '''Igbo''': "The fly who has no one to advise it follows the corpse into the ground."
:'''Jamaican''': "Sweet-mout' fly follow coffin go a hole"; "Idle donkey follow cane-bump [the cart with cane cuttings] go a [animal] pound"; "Idle donkey follow crap-crap [food scraps] till dem go a pound [waste dump]."
* '''Igbo''': "The sleep that lasts for one market day to another has become death."
:'''Jamaican''': "Take sleep mark death [Sleep is foreshadowing of death]."

== History ==

=== The birth of the IAEG ===
During the XXII [[International Geological Congress]] (IGS) in New Delhi, on 12 December 1964, the Israeli geologist [[Asher Shadmon]] remarked that ''"quarry materials and mineral products used in engineering"'' were not being discussed and proposed that the IUGS should create and fund an international permanent commission dedicated to that topic. Other geologists at the congress suggested that the commission should cover also the relationship between the materials in their natural place and the work of engineers.

On 17 December the assembly voted the following motion unanimously: ''"It is recommended that a distinct Commission of "Engineering Geology" should be established in the context of International Geological Congresses.[…] The objective of the Commission and its Sub-commissions would be to promote the knowledge and dissemination of appropriate information, gather ´case-histories´, prepare literature reviews and relevant catalogues, provide information on completed or ongoing research, gather statistical geological data on the industries and determine the list of further research required"''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnould|first=Marcel|date=1970|title=The International Association of Engineering Geology. History - Activity.|url=|journal=Bulletin of the IAEG|location=Paris|volume=1|pages=22–28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=30th anniversary of the IAEG / 30ème anniversaire de l’AIGI: Evolution of the IAEG life, Engineering geology as an independent science.|last=Shadmon|first=Asher|date=1994|work=IAEG Newsletter|access-date=|location=Paris|volume=21|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December, although the interest in engineering geology was high, due to scarcity of resources that did not allow to support a new permanent commission, the executive committee of the IUGS proposed to create a small committee, headed by Shadmon, in charge of producing and presenting a report on the state of the situation by contacting the [[International Society for Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering|International Society for Soil Mechanics]] and the [[International Society for Rock Mechanics]], as well as existing national societies of engineering geology.

However on 21 December the delegates decided to immediately hold a new session during which the ''International Association for Engineering Geology'' (IAEG) was unanimously created. Besides Asher Shadmon, the founding members were Marcel Arnould (France), G. Bain (USA), M.S. Balasundaram (India), L.M.C. Calembert (Belgium), R.S. Chaturvedi (India), G.C. Chowdhary (India), E. Beneo (Italy), K. Erguvanli (Turkey), A. Hamza (India), M.S. Jain (India), L.E. Kent (South Africa), V.S. Krishnaswamy (India), J.D.S. Lakshmaman (France), A.R. Mahendra (India), M. Manfredi (Italy), V. Prasad (India), B. Ramchandran (India), J.Th. Rosenqvist (Norway), B. Sanatkumar (India), P.B. Srinivasan (India), L.S. Srivastava (India) and M. Zapata (Spain). They elected a provisional committee to steer the initial activity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== The first years ===
At the beginning, the association worked on enhancing the provisional committee to gain full international representation. By the end of 1966, the committee was composed as follows: Asher Shadmon (Israel), as President; Marcel Arnould (France), as Secretary; E. Beneo (Italy); V.S. Krishnaswamy, R.S. Mithal and M.S. Balasundaram (India); K. Erguvanli (Turkey); A.M. Hull (USA), president of the American Association of Engineering Geologist; E.M. Sergeev and N.V. Kolomenskij (USSR); Quido Záruba (Czechoslovakia); M.D. Ruiz (Brazil); G. Champetier de Ribes (France), as Treasurer. Discussions to join the IAEG were still ongoing with representatives of Australia, Japan and Mexico.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

During the first two years the first statutes were established and a programme of the activities was defined. The purposes and goals of the association were defined as follows: ''"Article 1: The scope of engineering geology covers the applications of earth sciences to engineering, planning, construction, prospecting, testing and processing of related materials"; "Article 2: The aims of the IAEG are to encourage'' ''research, training and dissemination of knowledge by developing the international cooperation in its relation to engineering".''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

At the 1967 meeting of the IUGS, a request of affiliation of the IAEG to the IUGS was presented and accepted by the executive committee. The decision was ratified unanimously by the general assembly of the IUGS on 23 August 1968 in Prague.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The first general assembly ===
The input from the Czechoslovakian engineering geologist has been noticeable in the first years, especially that of Quido Záruba and Jaroslav Pasek. They were together responsible for organizing a section on engineering geology at the XXIII International Geological Congress (IGC) in Prague in 1968, at which they shared the aims of the IAEG. They also organised the first scientific symposium of the IAEG in Brno (Czechoslovakia), from 26 to 27 April 1968 and a second symposium during the IGC on ''"Engineering geology and land planning"''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The first general assembly was held on 23 August 1968 in Prague during the XXIII IGC. At the time of the congress, the country was deeply affected by the movement of soviet troops. Nevertheless, the general assembly went ahead and the statutes were ratified and an executive committee was elected for a period of four years to replace the provisional committee.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The new committee was composed as follows: Quido Záruba (Czechoslovakia), President; Marcel Arnould (France), Secretary General; G. Champetier de Ribes (France), Treasurer; Asher Shadmon (Israel), Past President; L. Calembert (Belgium), Vice-president for Europe; L. Cluff (USA), Vice-president for North America; M.D. Ruiz (Brazil), Vice-president for South America; L. Oborn (New Zealand), vice president for Australasia; H. Tanaka (Japan), Vice-president for Asia; a representative from Ghana as Vice-president for Africa. Other members: N.V. Kolomenskij (USSR); A Nemock (Czechoslovakia); J. Janjic (Yugoslavia); R. Glossop (United Kingdom); A. Drucker (Federal Republic of Germany); J.M. Crepeau (Canada).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In addition to the executive committee, three "working groups" were established:

# Landslides, under the responsibility of J. Pasek (Czechoslovakia);
# Soluble rocks, under the responsibility of F. Reuter (East Germany) and K. Erguvanli (Turkey);
# Geotechnical mapping, under the responsibility of M. Matula (Czechoslovakia).

Finally, it was decided to organize future congresses specifically for the IAEG and to hold these alternately with the International Geological Congresses, which means that both events would take place every four years but the IAEG would have a congress with a general assembly every two years and scientific symposia in the years in between.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The first congresses with general assemblies were as follows:

* New Dehli (India) XXII IGC in 1964
* Prague (Czechoslovakia) XXIII IGC in 1968; 
* Paris (France) 1st IAEG congress in 1970.

=== The Bulletin of the IAEG ===
The first elected executive committee decided in their second meeting at the UNESCO Palace in Paris (May 1969) to create a journal of the IAEG, to be edited and published by the Association and called the [[Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment|Bulletin of the IAEG]] (full name: ''"Bulletin of the International Association of Engineering Geology - Bulletin de l'Association Internationale de Géologie de l'Ingénieur"'').

The first edition of the Bulletin was distributed during the first IAEG congress in September 1970 in Paris. This was possible thanks to the personal efforts of Quido Záruba, the IAEG president, J. Pasek, Marcel Arnould and several other staff from the [[Mines ParisTech|Paris School of Mines]]. Starting as a simple artisanal publication, the Bulletin became a scientific reference among the most respected journals in the fields of engineering geology, the environment and other geosciences, and "the official journal of the IAEG". It is now published by [[Springer Science+Business Media]] and edited by the Association, and goes with the title ''Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment.''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== The second statutes ===
As a result of the progressive involvement of engineering geologists in consulting, in the study, design, construction and supervision of large projects and in the assessment and remediation of environmental issues, an update of the first statutes of the association was deemed necessary. The second statutes were approved by the general assembly in Kyoto (Japan) in 1992.

A new definition of [[engineering geology]] was given, which reflected the experience collected during the previous 25 years and read as follows: ''“Engineering geology is a science devoted to the investigation, study and solution of engineering and environmental problems which may arise as the result of the interaction between geology and the works and activities of man as well as to the prediction of and the development of measures for prevention or remediation of geologic hazards. Engineering geology embraces: the definition of geomorphology, structure, stratigraphy, lithology and groundwater conditions of geological formations; the characterization of the mineralogical, physico-geomechanical, chemical and hydraulic properties of all earth materials involved in construction, resource recovery and environmental change; the assessment of the mechanical and hydrologic behaviour of soil and rock masses; the prediction of changes to the above properties with time; the determination of the parameters to be considered in the stability analysis of engineering works and of earth masses; and the improvement and maintenance of the environmental condition and of the properties of the terrain”''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Members ==
As of May 2018, the IAEG has 3,798 members&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; divided as follows:

* North America - 204 members;
* South America - 102 members;
* Europe - 1848 members;
* Africa - 172 members;
* Asia - 798 members;
* Australasia - 684 members.

The IAEG has 59 national groups (+1 for the territory of Chinese Taipei):&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The '''Kaokoveld Desert''' is a [[deserts and xeric shrublands|coastal desert]] of northern [[Namibia]] and southern [[Angola]].

==Setting==
The Kaokoveld Desert occupies a coastal strip covering {{convert|45,700|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, from 13° to 21°S and is bounded by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west, the [[Namibian savanna woodlands]] to the east, and the [[Namib Desert]] to the south. It includes the Mossamedes Desert of southern Angola. The Kaokoveld is a harsh desert of drifting sandunes and rocky mountains. It receives most of its rainfall during the summer, which distinguishes it from the adjacent Namib Desert to the south, which receives most of its rain during the winter.
The [[Kunene River]] is the only permanent watercourse but many dry riverbeds (including the [[Hoanib]], [[Hoarusib]] and [[Khumib River]]s) carry moisture through the desert and are home to animals including elephants, black rhinos, and giraffe. Other than those the area is ancient desert sand, moistened by occasional coastal fog.

==Flora==
The Kaokoveld is home to ''[[Welwitschia mirabilis]]'', a plant that has no close living relatives.

==Fauna==
The Kaokoveld is home to a number of endemic reptiles while large mammals including [[desert elephant]]s (''Loxodonta africana''), black rhinos (''[[Diceros bicornis]]'') and giraffes (''[[Giraffa camelopardalis]]'') visit the riverbeds. There is a great deal of birdlife including the endemic Cinderella waxbill (''[[Estrilda thomensis]]'') on the Kunene River.

==Threats and preservation==
[[Skeleton Coast National Park]] runs for 500 km along the coast of Namibia and is the main protected area in the region, along with other smaller conservancies inland. Much of the area was formerly protected under Game Reserve 2, which was reduced in size to become [[Etosha National Park]] in 1967, with a subsequent increase in poaching and more recently uncontrolled off-road driving. There is an area of sand dunes in [[Iona National Park]] in Angola.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31300">For the majority of cities in [[North America]], the most recent official population census results, estimates or short-term projections date to 2015. This list compiles figures for all North American cities with a population [[city proper|within city limits]] exceeding 500,000 that year. These figures do not reflect the population of the [[urban area|urban agglomeration]] or [[metropolitan area]] which typically do not coincide with the administrative boundaries of the city. They refer to mid-2015 populations with the following exceptions:
#Mexican cities, whose figures derive from the 2015 Intercensal Survey conducted by [[National Institute of Statistics and Geography|INEGI]] with a reference date of 15 March 2015;&lt;ref name=MXdate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/est/contenidos/proyectos/encuestas/hogares/especiales/ei2015/doc/eic_2015_presentacion.pdf |title=Encuesta Intercensal 2015: Presentación de resultados |page=5 |publisher=[[INEGI]] |accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Edmonton, which conducted municipal censuses in April 2014 and April 2016 but has not reported an [[intercensal estimate]] of its 2015 population. The April 2016 census result is given instead.

This is a '''list of [[airport]]s in [[Saint Martin]]''', an [[island]] in the northeast [[Caribbean]].

The southern [[Netherlands|Dutch]] half of the island comprises the ''[[Sint Maarten]]''  and is a [[Countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|constituent country]]. This portion contains the island's international airport: [[Princess Juliana International Airport]].

The northern [[France|French]] half of the island comprises the ''[[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Collectivité de Saint-Martin]]'' (Collectivity of Saint Martin), which became an [[overseas collectivity]] (''collectivité d'outre-mer'' or ''COM'') of [[France]] on February 22, 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5313">[[Menorca]] is a small island in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] belonging to [[Spain]], with a population of approximately 88,000. It is located 39°47' to 40°00'N, 3°52' to 4°24'E. There is good data on the butterflies of Menorca&lt;ref&gt;Cello, J., 1980. Els Rhopalocera de les Illes Balears. ''Treb. Soc. Cat. Lep.'', 3:51-60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cello, J., 1980. Els Rhopalocera de les Illes Balears. Cens provisional. ''Treb. Soc. Cat. Lep.'', 4:33-53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pons, G., 2000. ''Les papallones diurnes de les balears.'', 87pp. Edicions Documenta Balear, Palma de Mallorca.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carreras, J., Jubany, J., and Stefanescu, C. 2004 Noves cites de papallones diürnes per a Menorca i les Illes Balears (Lepidoptera: Rhopalocera) ''Butll. Soc. Cat. Lep., 93.'' http://www.obsam.cat/documents/articles/Noves-cites-papallones-diurnes-Menorca-Balears.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not easy to find as most field guides do not give data on the smaller Mediterranean islands. A good source in English is Butterflies of Menorca&lt;ref&gt;[http://turismenatural.obsam.cat/en/papallones/papallones-de-menorca/ Butterflies of Menorca]&lt;/ref&gt; which lists 26 species and gives data on flight period and abundance.

Butterflies can be seen in all months of the year but the best months are May to September, the only butterfly not to fly in this period is the green hairstreak which usually flies from February to April, but if the season is late it can be seen into May.

* ''[[Gonepteryx rhamni]]'', brimstone (rare; very few good records - Brimstones on Menorca maybe scarce migrants from the Spanish mainland but in the field it is hard to tell apart from the very common Cleopatra so it is probably under reported.)

In 1990 it was introduced, accidentally, to [[Majorca]] on imported ''[[Pelargonium]]'' from South Africa. The butterflies quickly spread to Menorca and other islands as well as to southern Spain and Italy. They are often seen in gardens on geranium plants.)

This is a '''list of diplomatic missions of Afghanistan''', excluding honorary consulates.

At the height of the Taliban regime in the 1990s the only Afghan missions were in [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] (the only countries which recognised the [[Taliban]] regime).  For a while when the Taliban controlled 90% of the country, the ultra-fundamentalist regime was also seeking to regain control of [[Afghanistan]]'s seat at the [[United Nations]], held by the [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]].

Shortly after the September 11 attacks, [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] closed down the Afghan missions to the point [[Afghanistan]] had no foreign functioning embassies.

This list is of '''heritage registers''', inventories of [[Cultural property|cultural properties]], natural and man-made, tangible and [[Intangible cultural heritage|intangible]], movable and immovable, that are deemed to be of sufficient [[Values (heritage)|heritage value]] to be separately identified and recorded. In many instances the pages linked below have as their primary focus the registered assets rather than the registers themselves. Where a particular article or set of articles on a [[List of Wikipedias|foreign-language Wikipedia]] provides fuller coverage, a link is provided.

==United States==
{{Expand list|date=July 2012}}
In the United States, a site is only listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on recommendation from the [[state historic preservation office]]s in the relevant [[U.S. states|state]]. Some states maintain their own state-level historic registers, although in some U.S. states all properties on the state register duplicate the National Register listing. The National Register listing in itself confers no protection to a historic property but may qualify the site for matching grants for historic restoration. Local historic designations in many municipalities provide some limited protection against demolition of historic landmarks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12863">The list of '''British birds''' comprises all those [[bird]] species which have occurred in a wild state in [[Great Britain]]. Since the [[Victorian era]] many bird species have been introduced to Britain, whether for sport, ornament or general experimenting, and some have established themselves whilst others have not. Others have escaped from captivity and established themselves, though many species either die out after a few years or die off in harsh weather. This page lists the bird species that have established colonies in the [[British Isles]]. Some non-native birds have established themselves and become naturalised after naturally migrating to the country and forming colonies, such as the [[collared dove]].

Escaped birds of certain species, e.g. [[ruddy shelduck]], can cause confusion amongst birdwatchers as they occasionally occur in Britain as wild birds. 

The following species have established colonies in the UK at some point in time. They may have since died out, or new colonies established elsewhere.
[[Image:Rose-ringed Parakeet, Karkala, Karnataka, India.jpg|thumb|right|Ring-necked parakeets are now very numerous in places such as the home counties.]]
* [[Black-crowned night heron]]: Since 1951, a free flying colony of the American race has existed at [[Edinburgh Zoo]], Scotland, although the zoo now has a policy of not releasing free winged birds. There is also a similar colony at Great Witchingham, [[Norfolk]].
* [[Black swan]]: One of the commonest of escaped waterfowl, individual birds/pairs can be encountered on almost any body of water and several pairs breed annually, though so far no permanent colonies have become established.
* [[White-fronted goose]]: Wild birds do not breed in the UK. A small breeding population on [[Islay]] in Scotland stems from a wildfowl collection; feral birds may be encountered occasionally amongst flocks of other geese.
* [[Domestic goose]]: Common farmyard escapee. Can be encountered anywhere, and breeds readily with the [[greylag goose]], as the former is a subspecies of the latter.
* [[Bar-headed goose]]: Can be seen in scattered localities, though is not yet a regular breeder.
* [[Snow goose]]: Appears as a wild bird in Scotland annually, those seen in summer are escapes. A small population moves between the islands of [[Coll]] and [[Isle of Mull|Mull]] in the Scottish [[Inner Hebrides]]. There are also scattered birds elsewhere.
* [[Emperor goose]]: An occasional escapee which may be encountered amongst flocks of feral geese, but they have bred at [[Walney Island]] and in [[Essex]].
* [[Swan goose]]: The domesticated version of this bird, commonly known as the Chinese goose, is a common farmyard escapee and can be found on small ponds throughout the country. "True" swan goose is an infrequent escape, individuals or small parties may occasionally be encountered within feral flocks of [[Canada geese]] etc.
* [[Canada goose]]: First introduced in the 17th century, this bird has now spread throughout the country and is abundant throughout its range. Large flocks, often numbering several hundred birds, are a feature of many man-made waterways where truly "wild" geese are generally absent.
* [[Barnacle goose]]: A population of feral birds now exists in southern England, with strong populations in [[East Anglia]], [[Humberside]], [[Bedfordshire]], [[Gloucestershire]] and [[Hampshire]]. These birds are largely resident (wild barnacle geese are winter visitors to parts of Scotland and Ireland) and breeding is frequent. Away from these strongholds, individual feral and escaped birds often join flocks of their far more abundant relative, the [[Canada goose]]
* [[Egyptian goose]]: A population was first introduced in the 17th century, and historically, free-flying flocks were established on private estates in North [[Norfolk]], [[Devon]], [[Bedfordshire]] and [[East Lothian]]. They are now common in [[Norfolk]] and have spread west, as far as [[Rutland Water]]&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Sutherland &amp; G. Allport (2009) The distribution and ecology of naturalized Egyptian Geese Alopochen aegyptiacus in Britain, Bird Study, 38:2, 128-134, DOI: 10.1080/00063659109477080&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Ruddy shelduck]]: Birds are widely reported from all across Britain, especially [[Norfolk]] and south-western England, although confirmed breeding is unusual. Wild ruddy shelducks certainly occurred in Britain during the 19th century and early 20th century and some records, especially in late summer, may still refer to genuine vagrants from breeding areas in southern &amp; south-eastern [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]] (or wanderers from feral colonies across the [[North Sea]])
* [[Muscovy duck]]: A common escapee, frequent on town park lakes or anywhere ducks gather to be fed by humans, breeding pairs can be found on scattered waterways all across the country; a well-established colony exists in [[Cambridgeshire]]. These birds are of the [[Domestic muscovy duck|domesticated form]], differing from the wild South American Muscovy by showing varying amounts of white in their otherwise black plumage.
* [[Domesticated duck]]: The quintessential "farmyard duck" and domesticated form of the [[Mallard]], examples in varying plumages can be found on almost any [[Urban area|urban]] waterway. They will breed readily with genuinely wild mallards (in scientific terms, they are the same [[species]] and ultimately revert to the standard colouration).
* [[Wood duck|Wood or Carolina duck]]: A small population formerly existed in [[Bedfordshire]], it has now declined. In addition can be found breeding at other favoured sites in southern England, though individual escaped/feral birds are more frequent. Is also a potential vagrant from North America; care should be taken especially with birds sighted in south-western England and Ireland
* [[Mandarin duck]]: This Eastern Asian species was introduced as an ornamental bird, with escapes and deliberate releases resulting in a large and expanding population. Most numerous in the [[Home Counties]] but can also be found around [[Norfolk]], [[Rutland Water]], the [[River Severn]], and southern Scotland.
* [[Ruddy duck]]: Introduced to [[Gloucestershire]] in the 1950s as a result of escapees from [[WWT Slimbridge|Slimbridge Wildfowl Trust]], spread rapidly over central England, now subject to eradication program due to the fact that it threatens the [[white-headed duck]] in [[Europe]].
* [[Red-crested pochard]]: A population has become established in scattered areas across southern England, with a well-established breeding colony in the [[Cotswold Water Park]], [[Gloucestershire]]/[[Wiltshire]]:
* [[Bobwhite quail]]: Introduced as game bird to many areas; colonies became established in [[Suffolk]] and the [[Isles of Scilly]], now rarely reported.
* [[Red-legged partridge]]: Introduced as a game bird in the 18th century, now common over much of England as far north as Scotland, and still regularly released for shooting.
* [[Chukar partridge|Chukar]]: Introduced many times for shooting in the past, and regularly hybridised with red-legged partridge until releases of both chukars and hybrids were banned in 1992. Now very rare if not extinct.
* [[Reeves's pheasant]]: Introduced in the 19th century to [[Bedfordshire]] and [[Inverness-shire]], but birds later died out, released for shooting up to the present day, and individuals may be found by chance all over the UK. Has been especially frequently reported in [[Norfolk]] over recent years.
* [[Silver pheasant]]: Introduced several times for use as a game bird and for ornament, but failed to naturalise. Reported occasionally.
* [[Green pheasant]]: Introduced for game shooting purposes, readily hybridises with common pheasant. Releases continue to this day and breeding has been speculated upon, though not proven, in [[Norfolk]]
* [[Common pheasant]]: First introduced as long ago as Roman times, now abundant all over apart from in cities and on the highest ground. Many millions released each year for shooting.
* [[Golden pheasant]]: Introduced to many areas for ornament and as a game bird. Can be encountered anywhere, but is declining as a breeding bird; stronghold remains the [[Breckland]] of [[Norfolk]], with populations persisting on [[Anglesey]], in [[Dumfries and Galloway]] and on [[Brownsea Island]], [[Dorset]]
[[Image:Goldenpheasant04.jpg|thumb|right|Golden pheasant are one of many game birds introduced for sport and ornamental purposes.]]
* [[Lady Amherst's pheasant]]: Introduced for shooting and ornament, but now the small population is confined to Bedfordshire (and is all but extinct). May be found elsewhere from time to time.
* [[Indian peafowl]]: Free ranging birds have escaped and bred on occasion, as has happened in [[Norfolk]], [[Nottinghamshire]] and [[Worcestershire]].
* [[Helmeted guineafowl]]: Birds may stray from farms into the surrounding countryside, and have bred on occasion. Others may just wander during the daytime, to return to the safety of the farm at night.
* [[Rock dove|Feral pigeon]]: Descendants of escaped (and released) domesticated [[rock dove]]s—one of very few truly [[feral]] species.
* [[Barbary dove]]: Cagebird escapes have bred, current status confused by the very similar [[collared dove]].
* [[Alexandrine parakeet]]: This bird, very similar to the ring-necked parakeet, is a frequent escape and has bred in the past.
* [[Ring-necked parakeet]]: Introduced in the 1960s, now widespread in [[south-east England]] and flocks of several thousand gather to roost at sites in [[Kent]], [[Surrey]] and [[Greater London]]. A bird which has readily adapted to [[Urban area|urban]] [[garden]]s, being a frequent visitor to feeding stations, it is now spreading outside of its current range, being able to tolerate the cold winters of the British Isles. The British birds are sometimes refereed to as [[Kingston parakeets]].
* [[Blue-crowned parakeet]]: Escapees have bred in Southern England.
* [[Monk parakeet]]: Several colonies have formed in recent years, notably in [[Hertfordshire]] and [[Surrey]].
* [[Budgerigar]]: Formerly several populations present, including a notable one on the [[Isles of Scilly]] which lasted many years. Now only likely to be encountered as an escapee, of which it is one of the most frequent.
* [[Eurasian eagle owl]]: A famous pair have set up residence in [[North Yorkshire]], and have sparked large media interest. Their status is unknown, as to whether they are escapees or wild birds; other reports, similarly of unknown origin, are occasionally received from wide-ranging localities.
* [[Little owl]]: First recorded in 1842 in Yorkshire, it is now well established throughout England and Wales.[http://www.nonnativespecies.org/factsheet/factsheet.cfm?speciesId=399]
* [[Red-winged laughingthrush]]: One escaped pair of this curious bird have apparently bred on the [[Isle of Man]].
* [[Yellow-fronted canary]]: Cage bird escapes on occasion, though they often do not last long in our climate.
* [[Domestic canary]]: Escapes have survived for some time in the wild, though they are not thought to have bred.
* [[Waxbill|Common waxbill]]: Cagebird escapes of several species from time to time.
* [[Zebra finch]]: This bird is extremely common in aviculture, and is a very productive breeder. Small colonies may set up from time to time after a multiple escape, but they rarely last long.

In addition to the species listed below, almost any bird kept in captivity (especially wildfowl) may escape and their origins may not always be obvious. Excluding the likelihood of captive origin is a major hurdle to be faced by the [[British Birds Rarities Committee]] when assessing  reports of rare and vagrant species to Britain.

The '''Maiden Paps''' are twin hills near [[Hawick]], in the [[Scottish Borders]] of the south east of [[Scotland]], that have the shape of human [[breasts]]. They are located 12 km south of Hawick; the higher pap is 510 m and the lower 500 m high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geolocation.ws/v/W/4d7c3d308786567a40009ad4/the-maiden-paps-viewed-from-moorland/en The Maiden Paps]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are some well defined hills like the Maiden Paps, the Roxburgh Hills are gently rolling for the most part, like much of the [[Southern Uplands]]. Due to the surrounding [[landscape]], hills such as the Maiden Paps tend to look more prominent than they actually are.

The Maiden Paps are relatively close to [[Shankend]] (3.5 km to the NE) and to the [[Hermitage Castle]] (6 km to the south); these are two places with a sinister reputation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1817">The '''Photochemical Reflectance Index''' ('''PRI''') is a reflectance measurement developed by [[John Gamon]] during his tenure as a postdoctorate fellow supervised by [[Christopher Field]] at the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University. The PRI is sensitive to changes in [[carotenoid]] pigments (e.g. [[xanthophyll]] pigments) in live [[foliage]]. Carotenoid pigments are indicative of photosynthetic light use efficiency, or the rate of [[carbon dioxide]] uptake by foliage per unit energy absorbed. As such, it is used in studies of vegetation productivity and stress. Because the PRI measures plant responses to stress, it can be used to assess general ecosystem health using satellite data or other forms of remote sensing. Applications include [[vegetation health]] in evergreen [[shrubland]]s, forests, and agricultural crops prior to [[senescence]]. PRI is defined by the following equation using reflectance (ρ) at 531 and 570&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength:

:&lt;math&gt;PRI=\frac{(\rho 531- \rho 570)}{( \rho 531+ \rho 570)}&lt;/math&gt;
Some authors use
:&lt;math&gt;PRI=\frac{( \rho 570- \rho 531)}{( \rho 570+ \rho 531)}&lt;/math&gt;

The values range from –1 to 1.

{{Culture of Bangladesh}}
[[Bangladesh]] has numerous public holidays, including national memorial, religious and  secular holidays of Bengali origin. The Bengali traditional calendar, known as [[Banggabda]]  is the national and official calendar in Bangladesh. The holidays are celebrated according to Bengali, Islamic or Gregorian calendars for religious and civil purposes, respectively. Religious festivals like Eid are celebrated according to the [[Islamic calendar]] whereas other national holidays are celebrated according to the Bengali and [[Gregorian calendar]]. While the Islamic calendar is based on the movement of the moon, it loses synchronization with the seasons, through seasonal drift. Therefore, some public holidays are subject to change every year based on the lunar calendar.

There are fifteen public holidays in Bangladesh. Muslims and non-Muslims have four religious holidays each in addition to the secular seven national holidays. For the [[Muslims]], four major [[Islamic holidays]]:  [[Muharram]], [[Mawlid]],  [[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid ul-Adha]] are observed. For the [[Hindus]]: [[Krishna Janmashtami]] and [[Durga Puja]] are celebrated. As for the [[Christians]] and [[Buddhist]]s: [[Christmas]] and [[Vesak]] (one day each) are celebrated.

'''Raymond L. Bryant''' is a British-Canadian [[geographer]] and Professor of Political Ecology at [[King's College London]]. He is known for his contributions to the interdisciplinary field of [[political ecology]].

==Education and career==

Bryant studied [[political science|politics]] to receive a [[BA (Hons)]] from the [[University of Victoria]], Canada, in 1983 and an [[Master of Arts|MA]] from [[Carleton University]], Canada, in 1989. He received a [[PhD]] from the [[School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London]] in 1993 for research on [[forestry]] in [[Burma]].&lt;ref name=KCLstaff&gt;{{ cite web | url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/geography/people/academic/bryant/index.aspx | title=Raymond Bryant | publisher=King's College London  | accessdate=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryant has been active in the Department of Geography at King's College London since 1993. He has also taught at [[Cambridge University]], [[Yale University]] and [[University College London]] and has, among other places, been invited to speak at the universities in [[Oxford University|Oxford]], [[Chicago University|Chicago]] and [[Copenhagen University|Copenhagen]].&lt;ref name=KCLstaff /&gt;

He serves on the editorial boards of [[Political Geography (journal)|Political Geography]], the [[Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography]], and the [[Journal of Political Ecology]].&lt;ref name=KCLstaff /&gt;

==Scholarship==

===Political ecology===
Bryant has played a key role in the development of political ecology as an [[interdisciplinary]] field, with implications in geography, [[anthropology]], and [[development studies]]. With [[Sinéad Bailey]], he published the landmark ''Third World Political Ecology'' (Routledge, 1997) arguing that the costs and benefits of [[environmental change]] always are distributed unequally. Environmental change also reinforces or alters social and economic [[Economic inequality|inequalities]] as well as [[power (social and political|power]] relations. Bryant and Bailey developed an actor-centred perspective to show how environmental change is shaped by actors on different [[Scale (ratio)|scales]] with unequal power resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Bryant | first1=Raymond | last2=Bailey | first2=Sinéad | year=1997 | title=Third World Political Ecology | location=London | publisher=Routledge | isbn=0415127440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryant has continued to synthesize research in the field, most recently in the ''International Handbook of Political Ecology'' (Edward Elgar, 2015).

===Forestry===
A key theme in Bryant's research has been the politics of forestry, particularly in Burma. He has studied how the Burmese state historically has sought to control forests and forest-related activities, but also how other environmental actors including [[peasants]], [[lumberjack|loggers]], and [[transnational corporations]] have contested state control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Bryant | first1=Raymond | year=1997 | title=The Political Ecology of Forestry in Burma, 1824–1994 | location=Honolulu | publisher=University of Hawaii Press | isbn= 0824819098 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of a wider effort to study [[ethical consumerism|ethical consumption]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bryant | first1=Raymond L. | last2=Goodman | first2=Michael | year=2004 | title=Consuming Narratives: The Political Ecology of ‘Alternative’ Consumption | journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers | volume=29 | issue=3 | pages=344–366 | doi=10.1111/j.0020-2754.2004.00333.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; he has contributed to our understanding of the [[knowledge regime]]s and [[violence]] associated with [[teak]] [[brand]]ing for [[Western world|Western]] markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bryant | first1=Raymond L. | year=2013 | title=Branding Natural Resources: Science, Violence and Marketing in the Making of Teak | journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers | volume=38 | issue=4 | pages=517–530| doi=10.1111/tran.12006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NGOs and moral capital===
Another theme in Bryant's research has been the role of [[NGOs]] in environmental struggles and the way such organizations strategize and empower themselves by generating '[[moral capital]]'. Through in-depth studies of NGOs in [[the Philippines]], he argues that the 'quest for moral capital' is compromized by NGOs' need to work with political and economic elites.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last1=Bryant | first1=Raymond | year=2005 | title=Nongovernmental Organizations in Environmental Struggles: Politics and the Making of Moral Capital in the Philippines | location=New Haven, CT | publisher=Yale University Press | isbn= 0300106599 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Bryant lives with his wife and two children in London.

'''The Gully''' is a large underwater canyon in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near the edge of the eastern [[continental shelf]] of [[North America]]. It is located east of [[Nova Scotia]] near [[Sable Island]].

The Gully is [[1 E4 m|40 km]] long and 16&amp;nbsp;km wide and reaches depths of over 1&amp;nbsp;km. It is home to a resident population of Northern [[Bottlenose Whale]], Purple sunstarfish and deep-sea [[coral]]. Other species of [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[fish]], [[squid]] and [[shrimp]] also live there.

In 2004, [[Canada]] designated The Gully a Marine Protected Area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inter.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Maritimes/Oceans/OCMD/Gully/Gully-MPA&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada]] prohibit oil and gas exploration within this MPA.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestreet.com/story/14193950/1/oil-and-gas-platforms-dont-belong-in-the-laurentian-channel.html&lt;/ref&gt;
