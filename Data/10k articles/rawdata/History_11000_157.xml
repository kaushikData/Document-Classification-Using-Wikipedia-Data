The '''Ahlen water tower''' is an [[Industry|industrial]] [[monument]] and [[landmark]] in the [[Ahlen]], [[Germany]].

The [[spherical]] [[water tank]] is {{convert|44|m}} high and has a capacity of {{convert|1000|m3}}. From 1915 to 1917, the water tower served as the sole water supply for the [[Westphalia]] [[Mining|mine]] and the miners colony built in 1892 by Gelsenwasser AG.&lt;ref name=triposo&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahlen Water Tower|url=http://www.triposo.com/poi/Ahlen_Water_Tower|publisher=triposo.com|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=placeknow&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahlen Water Tower|url=http://placeknow.com/attractions/germany/ahlen/ahlen-water-tower-13370|publisher=placeknow.com|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=virtualglobetrotting&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Tower Ahlen|url=http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/abandoned-coal-mine-2/view/?service=0|publisher=virtualglobetrotting.com|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the distinctive blue water tower is monument and is a historical example of the early development of [[riveting]] at the beginning of the 20th century.

'''Alexander Neville''' (1544–1614) was an English scholar, known as a historian and translator and a Member of the House of Commons.

==Life==
Alexander Neville was the brother of [[Thomas Neville (dean)|Thomas Neville]], Dean of Canterbury, and son of Richard Neville of [[South Leverton]], [[Nottinghamshire]], by Anne Mantell, daughter of Sir Walter Mantell (d.1529) of [[Nether Heyford]], [[Northamptonshire]]. His mother's sister, Margaret Mantell, was the mother of the poet [[Barnabe Googe]].

Alexander was educated at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he graduated M.A. in 1581,&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=NVL559A|name=Neville, Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time as [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]]. On leaving the university he seems to have studied law in London, where he became acquainted with [[George Gascoigne]]. He is one of the five friends whom Gascoigne describes as challenging him to write poems on Latin mottoes proposed by themselves. Neville soon entered the service of Archbishop [[Matthew Parker]] apparently as a secretary, and edited for him ''Tabula Heptarchiae Saxonicae''.

He attended Parker's funeral on 6 June 1575, and wrote an elegy in Latin heroics. He remained in the service of Parker's successors, [[Edmund Grindal]] and [[John Whitgift]].  Possibly he is identical with the Alexander Neville who sat in parliament as M.P. for [[Christchurch, Hampshire]], in 1585, and for [[Saltash]] in 1601. He died on 4 October 1614, and was buried on 9 October in [[Canterbury Cathedral]], where the dean erected a monument to commemorate both his brother and himself. He married Jane, daughter of Richard Duncombe of [[Morton, Buckinghamshire]], and widow of [[Sir Gilbert Dethick]], but left no issue.

Nevill was a [[Member of Parliament]], representing  [[Christchurch (UK Parliament constituency)|Christchurch]] in the Parliament of 1585, for [[Peterborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Peterborough]] in 1597 and [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]] in that of 1601.{{sfn|Willis|1750|pp=104, 147}}{{sfn|Leedham-Green|2008}}&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=MP/&gt; But he appears to have been inactive.{{sfn|Leedham-Green|2008}}

==Works==

His major work was an account in Latin of [[Kett's rebellion]] of 1549, to which he appended a description of [[Norwich]] and its antiquities. The work, which was undertaken under Parker's guidance, was entitled ''A. Nevylii ... de Furoribus Norfolcensium Ketto Duce. Eiusdem Norvicus'', London (by [[Henry Binneman]]), 1575. A list of the mayors and sheriffs of Norwich was added. The dedication was addressed to Parker, and [[Thomas Drant]] prefixed verses. A passage in it spoke of the laziness of the Welsh levies who had taken part in the suppression of Kett's rebellion, and compared the Welsh soldiers to sheep. Offence was taken by the government at this sneer, and a new edition was at once issued with the offensive sentences omitted and an additional dedication to Archbishop Grindal, the successor of Parker. Neville also published in 1576 'A. Nevylii ad Walliae proceres apologia' (London, by Henry Binneman), in which he acknowledged his error of judgment. The account of Kett was appended under the title 'Kettus' to [[Christopher Ockland]]'s ''Anglorum Praelia'', 1582, and in 1615 an English translation by the Rev. Richard Woods of Norwich appeared with the title ''Norfolk Furies their Foyle under Kett and their Accursed Captaine: with a description of the famous Citye of Norwich''; another edition is dated 1623.

Neville was also a writer of Latin verse and prose. His earliest publication was a translation of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s ''[[Oedipus (Seneca)|Oedipus]]'', into a rough ballad metre in 1560, and dedicated to [[Henry Wotton]].&lt;ref&gt;It was first published as ''The Lamentable Tragedie of Oedipus the Sonne of Laius, Kyng of Thebes, out of Seneca. By A. Nevyle'', London, 1563.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Newton (poet)|Thomas Newton]] included it in his ''Seneca his Tenne Tragedies'', London, 1581. In 1587 appeared Neville's ''Academiae Cantabrigiensis lacrymse tumulo ... P. Sidneij sacratae per A. Nevillum'', Cambridge, 1587, with a dedication to the [[Earl of Leicester]]. [[John Harington (writer)|Sir John Harington]] commended this poem in his annotations on Ariosto's ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' (bk. 37).

Neville also contributed English verses to his cousin Barnabe Googe's ''Eglogs and Sonettes'', 1563.

==Notes==
{{reflist|group=lower-alpha|refs=
&lt;ref  name=MP&gt;[[Sidney Lee]] writing in 1894, suggested that he may be identical with the scholar Alexander Neville(1544-1614), secretary to [[Matthew Parker|Archbishop Parker]], although this was uncertain {{harv|Lee|1894|p=244}}. More recent scholarship by Elisabeth Leedham-Green for the 21st century [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] has confirmed that they are one and the same person {{harv|Leedham-Green|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Annales Bertiniani''''' (or '''''Annals of Saint Bertin''''') are late [[Carolingian]], [[Franks|Frankish]] [[annals]] that were found in the [[Abbey of Saint Bertin]], [[Saint-Omer]], France, after which they are named.  Their account is taken to cover the period 830-82, thus continuing the [[Royal Frankish Annals]] (741–829), from which, however, it has circulated independently in only one manuscript. They are available in the ''[[Monumenta Germaniæ Historica]]'' {{harv|Waitz|1883}} and in a later French edition taking into account a newly discovered manuscript {{harv|Grat|1964}}.
The ''Annals of St. Bertin'' are one of the principal sources of ninth-century [[Francia]], and are particularly well-informed on events in the West Frankish sphere of [[Charles the Bald]]. The ''[[Annales Fuldenses]]'' are usually read as an East Frankish counterpart to their narrative.

== Authorship and manuscripts ==
It has been suggested that the annals were first written by scribes in the court of [[Louis the Pious]]. There is no doubt that they were later continued as an independent narrative, eventually becoming somewhat emancipated from the Palace since the early 840s, first by [[Prudentius of Troyes]] (†861) and thereafter [[Hincmar of Reims]] (until 882), on whose lost manuscript their tradition is almost entirely dependent. Moreover, there are strong hints that the original text of the annals underwent at least minor changes under the latter's supervision.
&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nelson|1991|loc=pp. 7-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources ==
The annals' account is mostly first-hand and includes documents such as papal letters and excerpts from [[Synod|conciliar acts]].

== Content ==
The text is characterized by the struggles between the Carolingians, their relations to the Holy Roman Church – "''sancta romana ecclesia''" – and as well the raids from neighbouring regions.
Amongst these last are the practically annual reports of raids carried out by various [[warrior]]-bands from Scandinavia – whom are now popularly known as [[Viking]]s.

=== The Scandinavian raids ===
During the ninth century, these [[warrior]]-bands regularly laid waste to the lands of the [[Frisians]], sailed up rivers like the [[Seine]], [[Loire]], and [[Rhine]], where they caused great devastation in the country, and plundered Carolingian monasteries and episcopal cities. After 841, only in the years 874 and 875 are there no references to Viking activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nelson|1991|loc= 841-82}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is much to read in the annals, and the narrative sheds also some light on the many incidents that form the scenario in which Scandinavians came to more formal, i.e. diplomatic and ecclesiastic, relations with their southern neighbours – for example the [[Normans]]' [[fealty]] to [[Charles the Simple|King Charles III]] of [[West Francia]] in 911.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|ENCB|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concentration on ecclesiastic centres, which presumably housed vast amounts of movable wealth, has led some historians to believe that contemporary source writers, i.e. clergymen – including Prudentius and Hincmar, which are believed to have had at least editorial influence on the annals – exaggerated their accounts of the raids because they were usually the invaders' primary targets and frequently had to [[foot the bill]] when kings agreed to pay the Vikings off, as [[Charles the Fat]] did at the [[Siege of Paris (885–886)|Siege of Paris]] in 885-6.
&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sawyer|1971|loc=p. 120}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most scholars now believe the Vikings posed little more than a persistent, niggling military threat to the Carolingian regime.
&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Coupland|Nelson|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Rus' ===
The annals are notable, among other things, for containing one of the earliest written references to [[Rus' (people)|Rus']].
&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Garipzanov|2006|loc=p. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the annals, a group of followers to the emissaries from [[Constantinople]] was presented through a letter handed over to the emperor by the emissaries.
The letter stated that they called themselves Rhos – "''qi se, id est gentem suam, Rhos vocari dicebant''" – and had journeyed to Constantinople; but now they were fearful to return home, because the roads they had travelled were not safe.
They had therefore set out with the Byzantine embassy hoping to obtain the Franks' assent for travelling via Germany.
At [[Ingelheim]] royal residence, near [[Mainz]], they were queried by [[Franks|Frankish]] [[King of the Franks|Emperor]] [[Louis the Pious]], as he suspected they might be on [[reconnaissance]] ({{lang-lat|exploratores}}), and they could assure him in the rationale for their northern destination, as they belonged to the [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Sueones]]: "''eos gentis esse Sueonum''".
He decided to keep them by him until it could be ascertained for sure whether they had come in earnest purpose or not, and they are not mentioned again in the annals.
This incident is mentioned under the year 839.

A still ongoing polemic involves the phrase "''rex illorum Chacanus''" {{harv|Waitz|1883|loc=pp. 19-20}}, "''rex illorum Chaganos''" {{harv|Rau|1980|loc=p. 44}}. The phrase belongs to the written presentation to the emperor, and in context names the king of the Rus'; king Chacanus or Chaganos. {{harvtxt|Garipzanov|2006}} has recently made observations on the likelihood that '''chacanus''' is the correct, i.e. original term. The traditional interpretation is that 'rex illorum Chacanus' is meant to be understood as [[khagan]], not actually a person's name, but instead an entirely foreign kind of [[sovereignty]]. However, there is an alternative interpretation, that ''Chacanus'' is a Latin transcription of the Scandinavian proper name ''Håkan''&lt;ref&gt;Александров 1997 - Александров А.А. О руссах на Западе и на Востоке: от Ингельхайма до Могилевского клада // Гiстарычна археалагiчны зборник, (12),  Мiнск, 1997.  С.17-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Шинаков 2014 - Шинаков Е.А. Три первых упоминания русов (росов) конца 30 - начала 40-х гг. IX в. в международном аспекте // Вестник Брянского государственного университета. № 2,  2014.

Сборник статей в честь Ирины Геннадиевны Коноваловой. Под редакцией Т. Н. Джаксон и А. В. Подосинова. М.: Издательство «Индрик», 2014. С.323-329.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Garipzanov|2006|loc=p. 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Garipzanov holds to the latter and finds that the form 'chacanus' is a unique occurrence in Frankish sources; variants hereof, in the Carolingian sources, that do signify the foreign form of sovereignty are ''caganus'', ''chagan'', ''kagan'' and also ''chaganum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Garipzanov|2006|loc=p. 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
The further argument is quite complex.
--&gt;
Some scholars conclude that the Rus' people lived in northern Russia, but that their ancestral homeland was in Sweden.
&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jones|1984|loc=pp. 249-250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have also sought to establish a connection between the Rus'-Byzantine embassy to Louis the Pious and contemporary events in the Eastern Empire, as recorded in the ''Life of [[George of Amastris|St. George of Amastris]]'', [[Paphlagonian expedition of the Rus|one of the earliest Greek sources on the Rus']].

The narrative came to an end in 882 when an elderly, frail Hincmar was forced to flee his cathedral at [[Reims]] from approaching [[Viking]] invaders.
&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nelson|1991|loc= 882}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The scholar-bishop died shortly after at [[Épernay]], and the narrative was not continued.

The annals is one of five major independent narrative accounts of the late 9th century. The others are:
* ''The [[Annals of Fulda]]'' (838-901)
* ''The [[Annals of St. Vaast]]'' (874-900)
* ''The [[Annals of Xanten]]'' (832-874)
* The ''Chronicle'' of [[Regino of Prüm]] (870-906)

The '''''Annales Ceccanenses''''', also called the '''''Chronicon Fossae novae''''', is a chronicle of [[world history]] from the [[birth of Jesus]] down to 1218. It was a written in the late twelfth and early thirteenth century by an anonymous monk of [[Fossanova Abbey]], near [[Ceccano]]. It is partially dependent on the ''[[Annales Cavenses]]'' and ''[[Annales Casinenses]]'', and contains no original material prior to the year 1120. After that it is a valuable source for the history of the [[Papacy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Auguste Molinier]], [https://www-persee-fr.bibliopam-evry.univ-evry.fr/web/ouvrages/home/prescript/article/shf_0000-0000_1903_num_3_1_919_t1_0021_0000_6# "2289.

The '''''Annales Petaviani''''' (''AP'') is one of the so-called "minor annals group", three related ''[[Reichsannalen]]'', year-by-year histories of the [[Carolingian empire]] composed in [[Middle Latin|Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;The others are the ''[[Annales sancti Amandi]]'', ''[[Annales laubacenses]]'', and ''[[Annales tiliani]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; They are named after the former owner of the manuscript, the French Jesuit [[Denis Pétau]] (1583–1652), whose name, in Latin, is Dionysius Petavius. The standard [[critical edition]] of the ''Annales'' is that of [[Georg Pertz]] in the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]''. 

The first entry in the ''Annales Petaviani'' is for the year 687 and records the [[Battle of Tertry]]. There is then a gap until 708, when the annals begin again and continue to 799 in chronological order. Those entries through to 771 were compiled from earlier annals, such as the ''Annales sancti Amandi'' and the ''[[Annales mosellani]]'', and do not comprise an independent source. Together with the ''Annales sancti Amandi'', the ''Annales Petaviani'' are the primary source of the entries for 741–88 in the ''[[Annales laurissenses maiores]]''. Both of these may have been based on an earlier exemplar originally compiled contemporaneously with events at the convent of [[Great St. Martin Church|Sankt Martin]] in [[Cologne]]. For the years 771–99 the ''Annales Petaviani'' are an independent and contemporary source.

They are the only source to date [[Charlemagne]]'s birth to 747. They are also the only source to name either of [[Carloman I]]'s two known sons, who fled to Italy with his widow in 771. The one born towards 770, whom [[Pope Stephen III]] offered to baptise himself, was named Pepin. Carloman's widow, Gisela, is also named in only one source: the ''[[Annales mettenses priores]]''. The ''Annales Petaviani'' also provide a unique explanation for the retirement of Carloman's uncle and namesake, [[Carloman, son of Charles Martel]], who entered the [[Abbey of Montecassino]] in 747, leaving power in the hands of his brother, [[Pepin the Short]]. The ''Annales'' claim that Carloman's conversion to the religious life came about because his conscience was unsettled by his defeat in [[Alemannia]], where he lost thousands of men: ''Karolomannus intravit Alamanniam ubi fertur quod multa hominum millia ceciderit. Unde compunctus regnum reliquit'' ("Carloman enterred Alemannia where it is said that many thousands of men died. In remorse he relinquished the kingdom"). The ''Annales'' also provide evidence of an [[Anglo-Saxon]] presence in [[Marseille]], the great seaport of [[Merovingian]] [[Francia|Gaul]], when they note under the year 790 the death of the son of Botto, an English ''negotiator'' in Marseille.

The '''Archaeological Museum of Puerto de la Cruz''' ({{lang-es|Museo Arqueológico del Puerto de la Cruz}}) is a small [[archaeological museum]] located in the town of [[Puerto de la Cruz]] ([[Tenerife]], [[Canary Islands]], [[Spain]]). One of the most important local [[museum]]s, it offers an archival collection comprising more than 2,600 specimens of the aboriginal [[Guanches|Guanche]] culture, and a document collection named after researcher [[Luis Diego Cuscoy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueopc.museum/nuevo/pagina.asp?id=3 Fondo museográfico del espacio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111223949/http://www.arqueopc.museum/nuevo/pagina.asp?id=3 |date=2009-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Puerto de la Cruz museum has an enormous collection of aboriginal Guanche ceramics, including the remains of several ancient [[Guanche mummies]]. It contains several unique pieces native to the island, such as two [[limpet]] shells, a finding of [[Telesforo Bravo]], and an anthropomorphic figure or clay [[Cult image|idol]] known as "[[Guatimac]]".

'''Armen Ayvazyan''' ({{lang-hy|Արմեն Այվազյան}}) (born May 14, 1964, [[Yerevan]]) is an Armenian historian and political scientist.

Ayvazyan is the Director of the [[Ararat Center for Strategic Research]] and Senior Researcher in the [[Matenadaran]], the Yerevan Institute of Medieval Manuscripts. He holds doctoral degrees in History (1992) and Political Science (2004).

From 1992 to 1994 he worked as Assistant to the President of Armenia, Adviser to the Foreign Minister of Armenia, and Acting Head of the Armenian Delegation to the Conference (now Organization) on Security and Cooperation in Europe at Vienna.

He was a recipient of an International Security Studies grant provided by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, working in affiliation with the Program on the Analysis and Resolution of Conflicts, Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Syracuse University (1995). During the 1997-1998 academic year, he was a Visiting Senior Fulbright Scholar, affiliated with the Center for Russian and East European Studies, Stanford University, USA. He was a Visiting Alexander S. Onassis Foundation Fellow at ELIAMEP, Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy (2000–2001, Athens).

Ayvazyan worked as Adjunct Assistant Professor of Political Science at the American University of Armenia, a Fellow at the American University of Armenia's Center for Policy Analysis, Guest Lecturer at the Yerevan State University and Professor of Political Science of the Armenian State Academy of Governance. He was Team Leader of the European Commission's sponsored Campaign Against "Corruption-Friendly" Legal and Social Settings in Armenia program in 2004-2005.

==Publications==
After the presidential elections in 2013, he wrote a highly critical article in the ''Harvard International Review'', where he qualified the Russian-Western geopolitical game over the influence in Armenia as a [[no-win situation|lose-lose situation]], which damages both their long-term strategic interests and the viability of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hir.harvard.edu/2013-elections-armenias-geopolitical-future-and-prospects-for-democracy?page=0,0  "2013 Elections: Armenia's Geopolitical Future and Prospects for Democracy"], Armen Ayvazyan, ''Harvard International Review'', April 15, 2013.

Speaking with obvious difficulty in the lecture while seated in a wheelchair, Pinter distinguishes between the search for truth in art and the avoidance of truth in politics (5–10).&lt;ref name=ATP/&gt;

He describes his own artistic process of creating ''[[The Homecoming]]'' and ''[[Old Times]]'', following an initial line or word or image, calling "the author's position" an "odd one" as, experiencing the "strange moment … of creating characters who up to that moment have had no existence," he must "play a never-ending game with them, cat and mouse, blind man's buff, hide and seek" during which "the search for the truth … has to be faced, right there, on the spot."  Distinguishing among his plays ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'', ''[[Mountain Language]]'', and ''[[Ashes to Ashes (play)|Ashes to Ashes]]'', he segues into his transitions from "the search for truth" in art and "the entirely different set of problems" facing the artist in "[[Political theatre]]" to the avoidance of seeking "truth" in "[[politics|power politics]]" (5–9).

He asserts:{{quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;Political language, as used by politicians, does not venture into any of this territory [of the artist] since the majority of politicians, on the evidence available to us, are interested not in truth but in power and in the maintenance of that power. To maintain that power it is essential that people remain in ignorance, that they live in ignorance of the truth, even the truth of their own lives. What surrounds us therefore is a vast tapestry of lies, upon which we feed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As every single person here knows, the justification for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] was that [[Saddam Hussein]] possessed a highly dangerous body of [[weapons of mass destruction]], some of which could be fired in 45 minutes, bringing about appalling devastation. We were assured that was true. It was not true. We were told that Iraq had a relationship with [[Al-Qaeda]] and shared responsibility for the atrocity in New York of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001]]. We were assured that this was true. It was not true. We were told that Iraq threatened the security of the world. We were assured it was true. It was not true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The truth is something entirely different. The truth is to do with how the United States understands its role in the world and how it chooses to embody it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;}} Charging the United States with having "[[Criticism of United States foreign policy#Support of dictatorships and state terrorism|supported]] and in many cases [[United States involvement in regime change|engendered]] every right wing military dictatorship in the world after the end of the [[Second World War]]", leading to "hundreds of thousands of deaths," Pinter asks: "Did they take place? And are they in all cases attributable to [[US foreign policy]]?" Then he answers his own question: "The answer is yes, they did take place, and they are attributable to American foreign policy. But you wouldn't know it" (9–10).

Revisiting arguments from his [[Selected bibliography for Harold Pinter#Additional essays and speeches by Harold Pinter|political essays and speeches of the past decade]], Pinter reiterates:{{quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;It never happened. Nothing ever happened. Even while it was happening it wasn't happening. It didn't matter. It was of no interest. The crimes of the United States have been systematic, constant, vicious, remorseless, but very few people have actually talked about them. You have to hand it to America. It has exercised a quite clinical manipulation of power worldwide while masquerading as a force for universal good. It's a brilliant, even witty, highly successful act of [[hypnosis]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I put to you that the United States is without doubt the greatest show on the road. Brutal, indifferent, scornful and ruthless it may be but it is also very clever. As a salesman it is out on its own and its most saleable commodity is self-love. It's a winner. Listen to all American presidents on television say the words, 'the American people', as in the sentence, 'I say to the American people it is time to pray and to defend the rights of the American people and I ask the American people to trust their president in the action he is about to take on behalf of the American people.' (15)&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

In imagery recalling [[Characteristics of Harold Pinter's work#"Two silences": a "continual evasion" of "communication"|his description of "speech" as "a constant stratagem to cover nakedness"]], Pinter adds:{{quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;It's a scintillating stratagem. Language is actually employed to keep thought at bay. The words 'the American people' provide a truly voluptuous cushion of reassurance. You don't need to think. Just lie back on the cushion. The cushion may be suffocating your intelligence and your critical faculties but it's very comfortable. This does not apply of course to the [[Poverty in the United States|40 million people living below the poverty line]] and the [[Incarceration in the United States|2 million men and women imprisoned]] in the vast gulag of prisons, which extends across the US. (16)&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

Toward the end of the lecture, after reading two poems referring to "blood in the streets", "deaths", "dead bodies", and "death" by fellow Nobel Laureate [[Pablo Neruda]] ("I'm Explaining a Few Things") and himself ("Death"), in a whimsically humble gesture, Pinter offers to "volunteer" for the "job" of "speech writer" for President [[George W. Bush]], penning a ruthless message of fierce aggression masquerading as moral struggle of good versus evil yet finally proffering the "authority" of his (Bush's) "fist" (17–22).  Pinter demands prosecution of [[Tony Blair]] in the [[International Criminal Court]], while pointing out, with irony, that he would do the same for Bush had he not refused to "ratify" that Court (18).  Pinter concludes his Nobel Lecture with a call for "unflinching, unswerving, fierce intellectual determination, as citizens, to define the real truth of our lives and our societies" as "a crucial obligation which devolves upon us all," one which he regards as "in fact mandatory," for, he warns, "If such a determination is not embodied in our political vision we have no hope of restoring what is so nearly lost to us – the dignity of man" (23–24).

==Critical response==
Pinter's Nobel Lecture has been the source of much discussion.&lt;ref name=Sample/&gt;&lt;ref name=MerrittHPB/&gt; In an article published in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' on 11 November 2005, entitled "Pinter's Plays, Pinter's Politics," [[Middlebury College]] English professor [[Jay Parini]] observes that "In the weeks that have passed since Harold Pinter won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], there has been incessant chatter on both sides of the Atlantic, some of it unflattering," as "from the [[right-wing politics|right]], in particular, the American reaction to the Pinter award has been one of outrage," whereas "the reaction to the award from Pinter's peers––[[Michael Frayn]], [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]], [[Tom Stoppard]], and others––has been uniformly positive"; in response to naysayers, Parini concludes: "it may be true this time around that the Nobel Prize in Literature was given to the right man for the right reasons.  Few writers in our time have demonstrated such a passionate concern for victims of oppression, whether in the family's living room or in the torturer's faraway bunker, as Harold Pinter.  And few dramatists have been so vastly influential, transforming our basic sense of what happens when we enter a theater."

In response to his videotaped Nobel Lecture broadcast on [[More 4]] and distributed via the [[World Wide Web|internet]], heated critical debate about Pinter spiked in the [[mass media|public media]] and spread throughout the [[blogosphere]].  Such criticism of Pinter encompassed thousands of commentaries and focused mostly on his political activism, particularly his purported "anti-Americanism" and his generally "leftist" views.&lt;ref name=Sample/&gt;&lt;ref name=MerrittHPB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a critical discussion of the contexts of Pinter's Nobel Lecture, see Merritt, "(Anti-)Global Pinter."&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinter's official, authorised biographer, [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] observes that "the reactions to Pinter's Nobel Prize and Lecture" were "fascinating" and "overwhelmingly positive," though he thinks "it is worth picking out the few negative ones" as examples. He observes, "The most startling fact was that Pinter's Nobel Lecture on 7 December was totally ignored by the [[BBC]]", adding: "You would have thought that a living British dramatist's views on his art and [[global politics]] might have been of passing interest to a [[public broadcasting|public service]] broadcaster"; yet "There was ... no reference to the speech on any of [[BBC TV]]'s news bulletins that night or indeed on its current affairs programme, ''[[Newsnight]]''" (''Harold Pinter'' 424).  While "in the press, there was also a handful of attacks on both the award and the Lecture," Billington dispatches criticisms by three of them: "the normally sensible [[Johan Hari]]", who "dismissed the Lecture in advance [of its broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK] as a 'rant' and falsely claimed that Pinter would have refused to resist [[Hitler]]"; "in fact," Billington says, Pinter "has repeatedly said that, had he been of age, he would have accepted [[conscription]] in World War II" (424–25).  "More predictably, [[Christopher Hitchens]] was wheeled out to dismiss Pinter as 'a bigmouth who has strutted and fretted his hour upon the stage for far too long'&amp;nbsp;", and, finally, Billington cites Scottish historian [[Niall Ferguson]]'s "attack" on the Lecture in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', quoting in part Ferguson's statement that in his Nobel Lecture Pinter "&amp;nbsp;'pretend[s] that [US] crimes were equivalent to those of its Communist opponents ...'&amp;nbsp;"––a distortion according to both Billington and Pinter: "he never made any comparison in his speech between atrocities committed by the [[Soviet Union]] and China and those of America"; "&amp;nbsp;'All I ever said,' [Pinter] retorts, 'is that Soviet atrocities were comprehensively documented but that American actions weren't.  I didn't go into comparisons as to who killed more people as if it were a contest.  Ferguson distorted the whole bloody thing'&amp;nbsp;" (Qtd. in Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 425).  Billington also points out that the Harold Pinter Archive in the [[British Library]] contains "two large boxes containing the thousands of letters Pinter received from friends, colleagues, public eminences and total strangers applauding both the prize and his political stance" (425).

The "Harold Pinter Community" Forum hosted on ''HaroldPinter.org'', Pinter's official Website, illustrates further critical debate about Pinter's politics.

'''Ben-Zion Dinur''' ({{lang-he|בן ציון דינור}}, born '''Ben-Zion Dinaburg'''; 2 January 1884 &amp;ndash; 8 July 1973) was a [[Zionist]] activist, educator, historian and [[Israel]]i politician.

==Biography==
Dinaburg was born in 1884 in [[Khorol, Ukraine|Khorol]] in the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Poltava Oblast]], Ukraine). He received his education in a [[Lithuania]]n yeshivot. He studied under [[Shimon Shkop]] in the [[Telz Yeshiva]], and became interested in the [[Haskalah]] through [[Rosh Yeshiva]] [[Eliezer Gordon]]'s polemics. In 1898 he moved to the [[Hebron Yeshiva|Slabodka yeshiva]] and in 1900 he traveled to [[Vilnius]] and was certified a [[Rabbi]]. He then went to [[Lyubavichi]] to witness the [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] branch of [[Hasidic Judaism]]. Between 1902 and 1911 he was engaged in Zionist activism and teaching, which at some point resulted in a brief arrest. In 1910 he married Bilhah Feingold, a teacher who had worked with him in a girls' trade school in [[Poltava]]. In 1911 he left his wife and son for two years to attend the [[Berlin University]], where he studied under [[Michael Rostovtzeff]] and [[Eugen Täubler]]. He then spent two more years at the [[University of Bern]], where he began his dissertation under Rostovzev, on the Jews in the [[Land of Israel]] under the [[Roman Empire]]. The break of [[World War I]] forced him to move to the [[Saint Petersburg State University|University of Petrograd]]. However, due to the [[October Revolution]], he did not receive his PhD. He was a lecturer at the [[University of Odessa]] from 1920 to 1921.&lt;ref name=knesset/&gt;

In 1921 he immigrated to Palestine and from 1923 to 1948 served as a teacher and later as head of the Jewish Teachers' Training College, [[Jerusalem]]. In 1936 he was appointed lecturer in modern Jewish history at the [[Hebrew University]] and became professor in 1948 and professor emeritus in 1952. As a historian he described Zionism in the diaspora as "a huge river into which flowed all the smaller streams and tributaries of the Jewish struggle down the ages",&lt;ref name=wisse&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4871">Several '''Branches of the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]]''' were created by the kings, commanders and relatives of the Rashtrakuta family during their expansion into central and northern India in the eighth to the tenth centuries. These kingdoms ruled during the reign of the parent empire or continued to rule for centuries after the its fall or came to power much later. Well known among these were the Rashtrakutas of [[Gujarat]] (757-888),&lt;ref name="guj"&gt;[[Bisheshwar Nath Reu|Reu]] (1933), p93&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ratta dynasty|Rattas]] of [[Saundatti]] (875-1230) in modern Karnataka,&lt;ref name="kar"&gt;Reu (1933), p100&lt;/ref&gt; the Rashtrakutas of [[Rajasthan]] (known as Rajputana) and ruling from Hastikundi or Hathundi (893-996),&lt;ref name="has"&gt;Reu (1933), p110&lt;/ref&gt; Dahal (near [[Jabalpur]]),&lt;ref name="Dah"&gt;Jain (2001), pp67-75&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mandore]] (near [[Jodhpur]]), the [[Rathore]]s of [[Dhanop]],&lt;ref name="dhan"&gt;Reu (1933), p112&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rashtraudha Kavya|Rashtraudha]] dynasty of [[Mayuragiri]] in modern Maharashtra&lt;ref name="mayur"&gt;De Bruyne (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; and Rashtrakutas of [[Kanauj]].&lt;ref name="kanna"&gt;Majumdar (1966), pp50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rashtrakuta branches==
These branches emerged as a result of Rashtrakuta conquest of North India.

According to one theory, the [[Gahadavala Dynasty|Gahadavalas]] were an offshoot of the Rashtrakutas of Kannauj, but this theory is contradicted by epigraphic evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roma Niyogi |title=The History of the Gāhaḍavāla Dynasty |publisher=Oriental |year=1959 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EJQBAAAAMAAJ |oclc=5386449 |pages=29-33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descendants Of Rashtrakuta==

Their descendants are spread out over large areas of India.

[[File:The Celts - Conquerors of Ancient Europe &amp; The Celts - First Masters of Europe.jpg|thumb|left|300px|US edition (left) and UK edition.]]
In the 4th century BC, the [[Proto-Celtic language|Celtic "koine"]] spread over the whole of Europe, from the Balkans to the British Isles. There was no political unity, but a community of culture, which was expressed both by the exuberance of the [[Celtic art|art]] of metalworking and the same funeral rites. Christiane Éluère traces a history of more than half a millennium of these "barbarians" of the [[Celtic nations|West]]—who were the lovers of gold, wine and war, whom the [[Roman Empire]] tried to subjugate, reducing their frontiers to [[Gaul]], and the survival of their culture to the [[British Isles|island]] peoples, reborn in the art of [[Celtic Christianity]]—in this small but richly illustrated volume—{{lang|fr|L'Europe des Celtes}} (lit. "Europe of the Celts"; UK edition – ''The Celts: First Masters of Europe''; US edition – ''The Celts: Conquerors of Ancient Europe'')—published by [[Éditions Gallimard]] as the 158th volume in their {{lang|fr|Histoire}} series of the {{lang|fr|[[Découvertes Gallimard|Découvertes]]}} collection.

The book contains a huge number of colour illustrations—drawings, engravings, paintings, maps, but mostly the photographs of Celtic artefacts—it opens with a series of bronze masks and hoary faces carved in stone from 7th century BC to 1st century AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eyemagazine.com/feature/article/in-the-beginning-was-the-picture |title=In the beginning was the picture: NEW HORIZONS |last=Davies |first=Jim |date=1994 |magazine=[[Eye (magazine)|Eye]] |publisher= |access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were discovered in France, Austria and [[Bohemia]]. The [[body text]] is divided into six chapters: Ⅰ, "Birth of a Warrior Aristocracy" ({{lang|fr|Naissance d'une aristocratie guerrière}}); Ⅱ, "The First Celtic Princes" ({{lang|fr|La splendeur des premiers princes celtes}}); Ⅲ, "The All-Conquering Celts" ({{lang|fr|Les Celtes à la conquête du monde}}); Ⅳ, "The Celts Against the Might of Rome" ({{lang|fr|Les Celtes face au géant romain}}); Ⅴ, "Realms of Religion" ({{lang|fr|L'Univers des dieux}}); Ⅵ, "Celtic Memories" ({{lang|fr|Mémoires celtiques}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3233">'''David Erskine Baker''' (30 January 1730 – 16 February 1767) was an English writer on drama.

==Life==
David Erskine Baker was the son of [[Henry Baker (naturalist)|Henry Baker]], F.R.S., and his wife, the youngest daughter of [[Daniel Defoe]]. Baker was born in the parish of [[St Dunstan-in-the-West]] in the City of London, on 30 January 1730, and named after his godfather, [[David Erskine, 9th Earl of Buchan]]. When he showed  a taste for mathematics, [[John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu]], [[master of the ordnance]], placed him in the drawing room of the [[Tower of London]], to qualify him for the duties of a royal engineer. In a letter of 1747 to [[Philip Doddridge]] his father wrote&lt;blockquote&gt;At twelve years old, he had translated the whole twenty-four books of "Telemachus" from the French; before he was fifteen he translated from the Italian, and published, a treatise on physic of Dr. Cocchi of Florence concerning the diet and doctrines of Pythagoras, and last year, before he was seventeen, he likewise published a treatise of Sir [[Isaac Newton]]'s "Metaphysics" compared with those of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Dr. Leibniz]], from the French of [[Voltaire|M. Voltaire]]'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Communications from David Erskine Baker were printed in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'', but he married the actress Elizabeth Clendon on 6 August 1752, and joined a company of actors. In 1764 he published his ''Companion to the Play House''.  A revised edition, under the title of ''Biographia Dramatica'', appeared in 1782, edited by [[Isaac Reed]]. In the second edition, Baker's name is given among the list of dramatic authors, and we are told that 'being adopted by an uncle who was a silk throwster in [[Spitalfields|Spital Fields]], he succeeded him in his business; but wanting the prudence and attention which are necessary to secure success in trade he soon failed'. In compiling his ''Companion'' Baker was largely indebted to [[Gerard Langbaine]].  He adds little concerning the early dramatists. but his work is useful for the history of the stage during the first half of the eighteenth century.

He also wrote a small dramatic piece, 'The Muse of Ossian,' 1763, and  translated an Italian comedy in two acts, 'The Maid the Mistress' (''La Serva Padrona'') which was performed at Edinburgh in 1763  and printed  the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=1112|title=Baker, David Lionel Erskine|first=K. D.|last=Reynolds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Jones (editor)|Stephen Jones]], editor of the third edition of the ''Companion'' (1812), says that he died in obscurity at Edinburgh about 1770, while [[John Nichols (printer)|John Nichols]] &lt;ref&gt;''Literary Anecdotes'', v. 277&lt;/ref&gt; gives 16 February 1767 as the date of his death in his ''Literary Anecdotes''.

'''Diyarbakır Fortress''', is a historical fortress in [[Sur, Diyarbakır|Sur]], [[Diyarbakır]], [[Turkey]]. It consists of an inner fortress and an outer fortress.&lt;ref name="kulturvarliklari"&gt;[http://www.kulturvarliklari.gov.tr/TR,44403/diyarbakir-kalesi-ve-surlari-diyarbakir.html "Diyarbakır Kalesi ve Surları (Diyarbakır)"].&amp;#x20;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The main gates of the fortress are: Dağ (Mountain) Gate, [[Urfa]] Gate, [[Mardin]] Gate and Yeni (New) Gate.&lt;ref name="kulturvarliklari" /&gt; The walls come from the old Roman city of [[Amida_(Mesopotamia)|Amida]] and were constructed in their present form in the mid-fourth century AD by the emperor [[Constantius II]]. They are the widest and longest complete defensive walls in the world after only the [[Great Wall of China]] (the Theodosian Walls for example are longer in length, but are not continuous)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zaman.com.tr/sehir_diyarbakir-surlari_562160.html "Diyarbakır Surları"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523061446/http://www.zaman.com.tr/sehir_diyarbakir-surlari_562160.html|date=2015-05-23}}.&amp;#x20;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diyarbakirkulturturizm.gov.tr/TR,56899/surlar.html "Surlar"].&amp;#x20;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNESCO]] added the building to their tentative list on 2000,&lt;ref name="kulturvarliklari" /&gt; and listed it as a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2015 along with [[Hevsel Gardens]].

== Conservation ==
Though the walls and fortress itself were once compared to the Great Wall of China&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allaboutturkey.com/diyarbakir.htm|title=Diyarbakir|last=|first=|date=|website=allaboutturkey.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, this started to change as wars broke out during 2015&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/11/diyarbakirs-urban-plans-risk-destroying-heritage.html|title=Heartbreak in Turkey's Diyarbakir as development transforms ancient Sur|last=|first=|date=November 21, 2017|website=al-monitor.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;(&amp;Al-monitor); walls from the fortress collapsed, along with a mosque, two churches, and the homes of many civilians, forcing some sections to be abandoned&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

As the war continued, the government of Turkey and UNESCO jointly began a reconstruction and preservation effort, intending to complete it within two years, starting with the demolition of part of the city. Historic sites were spared, and in June 2015, UNESCO added the fortress and Hensel Gardens Cultural Landscape to UNESCO's World Heritage List. UNESCO's main focus was to protect the environment of the land itself, more than the heritage of the land&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/historic-structures-damaged-in-diyarbakir--89474|title=Historic Structures damaged in Diyarbakir|last=|first=|date=October 7, 2015|website=hurriyetdailynews.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. And the Prime Minister himself also spoke of plans to reconstruct the city walls as a great tourist attraction intended to resemble Paris; this provoked considerable controversy in Diyarbakir, with some locals arguing that they would lose their ancient culture heritage&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

== Architecture ==
Diyarbakir fortress is constructed with stone, black basalt, and adobe, and has gone through countless renovations; the basalt fortifications are exceptionally durable, one reason why the structure has remained relatively intact for over 2000 years. Diyarbakir fortress is among the best surviving examples of a castle or fort built with a natural feature like a cliffside or body of water on one side as a boundary. The walls have a symbolic function as well as a defensive purpose, with inscriptions on the inner city's walls (the fort) that testify to the city of Diyarbakir's history.&lt;ref name="castle"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-06-01|title=Castle architecture in Anatolia: Fortifications of Diyarbakir|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209526351300023X|journal=Frontiers of Architectural Research|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|pages=209–221|doi=10.1016/j.foar.2013.04.003|issn=2095-2635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Diyarbakir Fortress can be divided into two categories, the bailey and the citadel. In the northeast, the citadel contains the first settlement inside Diyarbakir, and those walls stretch 598 meters long. The bailey houses a tower and the city walls, surrounding the much more urban walled city region of Diyarbakir. Most of these walls are constructed with traditional masonry and construction styles; the towers consist of 2-4 floors and are 4.4 meters thick on the ground floor and get thinner on higher floors.&lt;ref name="castle" /&gt;

The castle plans reveal the dominance of two different building forms, circular and tetragonal. The walls were divided into five groups, four of which contained the towers around the four main gates, while the fifth contained the citadel towers. It has been found that 65 of the original 82 towers still remain on the outside of the city's walls and 18 of the citadel's towers remain today. Due to cultural differences, the fort has undergone some modifications. The fort was reconstructed, repaired and or heightened over time. However, the overall typology has remained constant in the fort's renovations.&lt;ref name="castle" /&gt;

== Construction ==
Diyarbakir fortress was first built in 297 AD by Romans under the order of Constantius II. Over the next 1500+ years, these walls were expanded and fortified using volcanic rock from the surrounding region. There are four main gates and 82 watch towers on the walls. &lt;ref name="thekurdishproject.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thekurdishproject.org/history-and-culture/kurdish-history/historical-sites-in-kurdistan/diyarbakir-city-walls/|title=Diyarbakir City Walls - The Kurdish Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Diyarbakir city walls have an ancient history dating back to the Romans. The towers at Diyarbakir were mainly built by the Romans and later reconstructed by the Ottomans when they took over the city in the 15th and 16th centuries. During the defeat of the Safavids at Diyarbakir, the Ottomans destroyed the walls with the use of cannons &lt;ref name="thekurdishproject.org"/&gt; and therefore had to be rebuilt. Today, the walls are largely intact, and form a ring around the old city that is over 3 miles in circumference. The walls are over 33 feet high and are about 10-16 feet thick. &lt;ref name="thekurdishproject.org"/&gt; They are the widest and longest complete defensive walls in the world after only the Great Wall of China.

== History ==
Diyarbakir Fortress was built, used, and rebuilt during the Roman and Ottoman periods, including the Diyarbakir city walls that measure up to 53 meters long. There are both inner and outer walls; the site also has several gates and towers. Included on the walls are about 63 inscriptions from various historical periods &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebruliturizm.com/4140/diyarbakir-fortress-and-hevsel-gardens-cultural-landscape/|title=Diyarbakır Fortress and Hevsel Gardens Cultural Landscape (2015) {{!}} EBRULI TOURISM- IZMIR-TURKEY|website=www.ebruliturizm.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;including remains from the Hurrians, Medes, Romans, Sassanians, Byzantines, Marwanids (Kurds), Ayyubids (Kurds), and Ottomans.

About one-third of the historic Old Town was deliberaitely destroyed by the Turkish state after the clashes ended, damaging the ancient city irreversibly.

'''Eli Filip Heckscher''' (24 November 1879 – 23 December 1952) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Political economy|political economist]] and [[Economic history|economic historian]].

==Biography==
Heckscher was born in Stockholm, son of the Jewish Danish-born businessman Isidor Heckscher and his spouse Rosa Meyer, and completed his secondary education there in 1897. He studied at [[Uppsala University]] and [[Gothenburg University]], completing his PhD in Uppsala in 1907. He was professor of [[Political economy]] and [[Statistics]] at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]] from 1909 until 1919, when he exchanged that chair for a research professorship in [[economic history]], finally retiring as emeritus professor in 1945. In 1929 Heckscher founded the [[Institute for Economic and Business History Research|Institute for Economic History Research]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

According to a bibliography published in 1950{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}, Heckscher had, as of the previous year, published 1148 books and articles, among which may be mentioned his study of [[Mercantilism]], which had been translated into several languages, and a monumental Economic history of Sweden in several volumes. Heckscher is best known for a model explaining patterns in [[international trade]] ([[Heckscher-Ohlin model]]) that he developed with [[Bertil Ohlin]] at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]].

Eli Heckscher's son was [[Gunnar Heckscher]] (1909-1987), a political scientist and the leader of what would later become the [[Swedish Moderate Party]] 1961–1965. His grandson is the [[Socialdemokratiska arbetarpartiet|Social Democratic]] politician [[Sten Heckscher]].

'''Gomes Eanes de Zurara''' (c. 1410 – c. 1474), sometimes spelled '''Eannes''' or '''Azurara''', was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[chronicler]] of the [[Age of Discovery]], the most notable after [[Fernão Lopes]].

== Life and career ==

Gomes Eanes de Zurara adopted the career of letters in middle life. He probably entered the royal library as assistant to [[Fernão Lopes]] during the reign of King [[Edward of Portugal]] (1433–1438), and he had sole charge of it in 1452. His ''Chronicle of the Siege and Capture of Ceuta'', a supplement (third part) to Lopes's ''Chronicle of King John I'', dates from 1450, and three years later he completed the first draft of the ''Chronicle of the Discovery and Conquest of Guinea'', our authority for the early Portuguese voyages of discovery down the African coast and in the ocean, more especially for those undertaken under the auspices of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]]. It contains some account of the life work of that prince, and has a biographical as a geographical interest.{{sfn|Prestage|1911}}

On 6 June 1454, Zurara became chief keeper of the archives and royal chronicler in succession to Lopes. In 1456 King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]] commissioned him to write the history of [[Ceuta]], the land-gate of the East, under the governorship of D. [[Pedro de Menezes, 1st Count of Vila Real|Pedro de Menezes]], from its capture in 1415 until 1437, and he had it ready in 1463. A year afterwards the king charged him with a history of the deeds of D. [[Duarte de Menezes, 3rd Count of Viana|Duarte de Menezes]], captain of [[Alcácer-Ceguer]], and, proceeding to Africa, he spent a year collecting materials and studying the scenes of the events he was to describe, and in 1468 he completed the chronicle. Afonso corresponded with Zurara on terms of affectionate intimacy, and no less than three [[comenda]]s of the order of Christ rewarded his literary services.{{sfn|Prestage|1911}}

Zurara had little of the picturesque ingenuousness of Lopes, and loved to display his erudition by quotations and philosophical reflections, showing that he wrote under the influence of the first [[Renaissance]]. Many leading classical, early Christian and medieval writers figure in his pages, and he was acquainted with the notable chronicles and romances of Europe and had studied the best Italian and Spanish authors. In addition, he had mastered the geographical system of the ancients and their astrology. As a historian he is laborious, accurate and conscientious, though his position did not allow him to tell the whole truth about his hero, Prince Henry.{{sfn|Prestage|1911}}

== Chronicle of the Henrican Discoveries ==

Zurara's ''Crónica dos feitos da Guiné'' is the principal historical source for modern conception of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] and the Henrican age of [[Portuguese discoveries]] (although Zurara only covers part of it, the period 1434-1448).  Commissioned by Henry himself,&lt;ref&gt;Zurara, ''Crónica dos feitos da Guiné'', (Ch.1, p.3).&lt;/ref&gt;  Zurara's chronicle  is openly hagiographic of the prince and reliant on his recollections. As a result, the reliability of Zurara's chronicles is considered suspect by modern historians.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvnb|Leite|1941}}; {{harvnb|Magalhães Godinho|1945}}; {{harvnb|Diffie|Winius|1977|p=48n}};{{harvnb|Russell|2000|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, having little else to draw upon, historians have had to rely heavily on Zurara.

Zurara claims to have based his account of the expeditions on a more detailed draft manuscript compiled by a certain "Antonio Cerveira".&lt;ref&gt;Zurara ([https://books.google.com/books?id=sd9BAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ch.32], ch. 56 and ch.84)&lt;/ref&gt;  Alas, no copy of Cerveira's original account has ever been found.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief note on the possible identities of Cerveria, see ''Monumenta Henricina'' {{harv|Almeida|Costa Brochado|Dinis|1967|loc=vol 8: [https://books.google.com/books?id=2EoiJHdxVkgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.87]}}. However, Teixeira da Mota believes that [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] may have had access to sources outside of Zurara {{harv|Teixeira da Mota|1946|pp=12–13}}, so possibly Cerveira's manuscript was still extant in the archives around 1507-10.  However,  Barros, writing in 1552, found no trace of it {{harv|Barros|1552}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zurara's own chronicle remained in manuscript form, and hidden from the public eye for centuries.  Indeed, until the publication of [[João de Barros]]'s ''Primeira Década da Ásia'' in 1552, there were no published works about the Henrican discoveries, save for the two brief memoirs of [[Alvise Cadamosto]] (published originally in Italy in 1507).

João de Barros claimed to have constructed his 1552 account on the basis of a copy of Zurara's manuscript he found scattered in the archives.  However, a little over a decade later, [[Damião de Góis]] (writing in 1567), announced that the Zurara manuscript had disappeared.{{sfn|Góis|1905|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_IoDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Ch.6]}}  A hunt for a copy of the manuscript began, but would turn up nothing for a while. The Spanish cleric [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], writing in 1540s, suggested he had a copy of Zurara, but that copy too was never tracked down.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leite|1941}}; {{harvnb|Teixeira da Mota|1946|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry the Navigator (Cronicas).jpg|thumb|right|175px|Frontispiece of Zurara's ''Crónica dos Feitos de Guiné'' (Paris codex)]]
It was only in 1839, that an intact and splendid preserved manuscript copy of Zurara's ''Cronica'' was rediscovered in the Royal Library of Paris (now the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]) by Ferdinand Denis (how it ended up there is a mystery).  Significantly, the Paris codex included a frontispiece with a portrait of a man with a thin moustache in a black Burgundian chaperon that was instantly assumed to be the physical image of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] (there were no pictures of Henry before this; the Paris frontispiece became the basis of modern images of the prince, reproduced in countless books, paintings and monuments since). Luís António de Abreu e Lima (Viscount de Carreira), the Portuguese minister to France at the time, arranged for the first publication of Zurara's ''Cronica'' in 1841, with a preface and notes by Manuel Francisco de Macedo Leitão e Carvalhosa (Viscount of Santarém).&lt;ref&gt;Original title in full was: ''Chronica do Descobrimento e Conquista da Guiné, escrita por mandado de El-Rei D. Affonso V, sob a direcção scientifica, e segundo as instrucções do illustre Infante D. Henrique, pelo Chronista Gomes Eannes de Azurara, fielmente trasladada do manuscrito original contemporaneo, que se conserva na Bibliotheca Real de Pariz, e dada pela primeira vez á luz per deiligencia do Visconde de Carreira, Enviado Extraordinario e Ministro Plenipotentiario de S. Majestade Fidelissima na corte da França, precedida de uma Introducção, e illustrada com algumas notas pelo Visconde de Santarem, Socio da Academia real das Sciencias de Lisboa, e de um grande numero d'Academias e sociedades sabias em Hespanha, França, Italia, Inglaterra, Hollanda, Suecia, e America, etc., e seguida d'um Glossario das Palavras e Phrases Antiquadas e Obsoletas''.  It was published in Paris by J.P. Aillaud in quarto., running 474 pages, with the frontispiece portrait.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nr4NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PP11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false copy online]&lt;/ref&gt;  The publication was a sensation, particularly as Portugal was then engaged in a diplomatic quarrel over recent Anglo-French colonial encroachments in West Africa where questions of priority of discovery were involved (to which Santarém contributed.)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Santarém|1841}}; {{harvnb|Teixeira da Mota|1946|pp=15–17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second manuscript copy was found shortly after, 1845, by [[Johann Andreas Schmeller|J.A. Schmeller]] in the [[Bavarian State Library|Hof- und Staats-Bibliothek]] in Munich (Codex Hisp. 27), as part of a collection of miscellaneous  accounts of Portuguese expeditions originally compiled in 1508 by Lisbon-based German printer known as [[Valentinus Moravus]] (or in Portuguese, as "Valentim Fernandes").  However, this version contains only extracts, and much abridged.&lt;ref&gt;See Schmeller's description {{harv|Schmeller|1847}}.

[[File:Frederick McCubbin - The pioneer - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Frederick McCubbin]], ''[[The Pioneer (painting)|The Pioneer]]'', 1904, [[National Gallery of Victoria]]]]
The '''Heidelberg School''' was an Australian [[art movement]] of the late 19th century. The movement has latterly been described as '''Australian Impressionism.'''&lt;ref name="ngv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/australianimpressionism/education/insights_intro.html|title=Introduction to Australian Impressionism|work=Australian Impressionism|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|accessdate=8 April 2010|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melbourne]] art critic Sidney Dickinson coined the term in a July 1891 review of works by [[Arthur Streeton]] and [[Walter Withers]]. He noted that these and other local artists, who painted ''[[en plein air]]'' in [[Heidelberg, Victoria|Heidelberg]] on the city's outskirts, could be considered members of the "Heidelberg School". The term has since evolved to cover painters who worked together at "artists' camps" around Melbourne and [[Sydney]] in the 1880s and 1890s. Along with Streeton and Withers, [[Tom Roberts]], [[Charles Conder]] and [[Frederick McCubbin]] are considered key figures of the movement. Drawing on [[naturalism (arts)|naturalist]] and [[impressionist]] ideas, they sought to capture Australian life, [[Australian bush|the bush]], and the harsh sunlight that typifies the country.

The works of these artists are notable, not only for their merits as compositions, but as part of Australia's cultural heritage. The period leading up to [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901 saw an upsurge in [[Australian nationalism]], and is the setting for many classic stories of [[Australian folklore]], made famous in the works of [[bush poetry|bush poet]]s associated with the [[The Bulletin#Early history|Bulletin School]], such as [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]]. The Heidelberg School's work provides a visual complement to these tales and their images have become icons of Australian art. The artists are well-represented in Australia's major public galleries, including the [[National Gallery of Australia]], the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] and the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]].

==History==
The name refers to the then rural area of [[Heidelberg, Victoria|Heidelberg]] east of [[Melbourne]] where practitioners of the style found their subject matter, though usage expanded to cover other Australian artists working in similar areas. The core group painted there on several occasions at "artist's camps" in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Besides [[Arthur Streeton]] and [[Walter Withers]], other major artists in the movement included [[Tom Roberts]], [[Frederick McCubbin]] and [[Charles Conder]].&lt;ref name="Heidelberg Artists Trail"&gt;[http://www.artiststrail.com/ Heidelberg Artists Trail]&lt;/ref&gt; See below for a list of other associated artists.

In August 1889, several artists of the Heidelberg School staged the [[9 by 5 Impression Exhibition]] at Buxton's Rooms, [[Swanston Street]], opposite the [[Melbourne Town Hall]]. The exhibition's three principal artists were [[Charles Conder]], Tom Roberts and [[Arthur Streeton]], with minor contributions from [[Frederick McCubbin]], [[National Gallery of Victoria Art School|National Gallery]] students R. E. Falls and Herbert Daly, and sculptor [[Charles Douglas Richardson]], who exhibited five ''sculpted impressions''. Most of the 183 works included in the exhibition were painted on wooden cigar-box lids, measuring 9 by 5 inches (23 × 13&amp;nbsp;cm), hence the name of the exhibition. [[Louis Abrahams (art patron)|Louis Abrahams]], a member of the [[Box Hill artists' camp]], sourced most of the lids from his family's tobacconist shop. In order to emphasise the small size of the paintings, they were displayed in broad [[Eucalyptus|Red Gum]] frames, some left unornamented, others decorated with [[verse (poetry)|verse]] and small sketches, giving the works an "unconventional, [[avant garde]] look".&lt;ref&gt;Lane, ''Australian Impressionism'', p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Japonism|Japonist]] décor featured Japanese screens, umbrellas, and vases with flowers that perfumed the gallery, while the influence of [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]]'s [[Aestheticism]] was also evident in the harmony and "total effect" of the display.&lt;ref&gt;Clark 1986, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artists wrote in the catalogue:

{{quote|An effect is only momentary: so an impressionist tries to find his place. Two half-hours are never alike, and he who tries to paint a sunset on two successive evenings, must be more or less painting from memory. So, in these works, it has been the object of the artists to render faithfully, and thus obtain first records of effects widely differing, and often of very fleeting character.}}

The exhibition caused a stir in Melbourne with many of the city's leading social, intellectual and political figures attending during its three-week run. The general public responded positively, and within two weeks of the exhibition's opening, most of the 9 by 5s had sold. The response from critics, however, was mixed. The most scathing review came from [[James Smith (journalist)|James Smith]], then Australia's most prominent art critic, who said the 9 by 5s were "destitute of all sense of the beautiful" and "whatever influence [the exhibition] was likely to exercise could scarcely be otherwise than misleading and pernicious."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, James. "An Impressionist Exhibition". ''The Argus''. 17 August 1889.&lt;/ref&gt; The artists pinned the review to the entrance of the venue—attracting many more passing pedestrians to "see the dreadful paintings"—and responded with a letter to the Editor of Smith's newspaper, ''[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus]]''. Described as a manifesto, the letter defends freedom of choice in subject and technique, concluding:

{{quote|It is better to give our own idea than to get a merely superficial effect, which is apt to be a repetition of what others have done before us, and may shelter us in a safe mediocrity, which, while it will not attract condemnation, could never help towards the development of what we believe will be a great school of painting in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Conder, Charles; Roberts, Tom; Streeton, Arthur.

Opened at 9 [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]] in April 1888, [[Grosvenor Chambers]], built "expressly for occupation by artists", quickly became the focal point of Melbourne's art scene, and an urban base from which members of the Heidelberg School could meet the booming city's demand for portraits. Tom Roberts, [[Jane Sutherland]] and [[Clara Southern]] were the first to occupy studios in the building, and were soon followed by Charles Conder and Louis Abrahams.&lt;ref name=site&gt;[http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/australianimpressionism/education/insights_ssites.html#06 Significant sites], National Gallery of Victoria. Retrieved 29 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the artists decorated their studios in an '[[Aestheticism|Aesthetic]]' manner, showing the influence of [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]. Roberts' use of [[eucalypt]]s and [[golden wattle]] as floral decorations started a fad for gum leaves in the home.&lt;ref name=site/&gt;

The presence of Roberts, Streeton and Conder at Grosvenor Chambers is reflected in the high number of urban views they included in the 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition.&lt;ref name=site/&gt;

Roberts first visited Sydney in 1887. There, he met the young Conder, and a strong artistic friendship blossomed. The pair painted together at the beachside suburb of [[Coogee, New South Wales|Coogee]] in early 1888 before Conder joined Roberts on his return trip to Melbourne.

When [[Panic of 1890|a severe economic depression]] hit Melbourne in 1890, Roberts and Streeton moved to Sydney, first setting up camp at [[Mosman Bay]], a small cove of [[Port Jackson|the harbour]], before finally settling around the corner at [[Curlew Camp]], which was accessible by the [[Sydney Ferries|Mosman ferry]]. Other ''plen air'' painters occasionally joined them at Curlew, including prominent art teacher and Heidelberg School supporter [[Julian Ashton]], who resided nearby at the [[Balmoral, New South Wales|Balmoral]] artists' camp. Ashton had earlier painted with Conder during the latter's Sydney days, and in 1890, as a trustee of the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales|National Gallery of New South Wales]] in Sydney, he encouraged the art museum to purchase Streeton's Heidelberg landscape ''′Still glides the stream, and shall for ever glide′'' (1890)—the first painting by the artist to enter a public gallery.&lt;ref&gt;Galbally, Ann (1972). ''Arthur Streeton''. Oxford University Press, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The more sympathetic patronage shown by Ashton and others in Sydney inspired other Melbourne artists to join them.

{{quote|Sydney became Streeton's subject. The bravura of his crisp brushwork and his trademark blue, the blue that he had used at Heidelberg, were perfectly suited to registering images of the bustling activity on Sydney's blue harbour.}}

From Sydney, Streeton and Roberts branched out into country New South Wales, where, in the early 1890s, they painted some of their most celebrated works.

==Influences and style==
[[File:Louis Buvelot - Summer afternoon, Templestowe - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|The ''plein air'' landscapes of colonial artist [[Louis Buvelot]] were particularly influential on the Heidelberg School.]]
Like many of their contemporaries in Europe and North America, members of the Heidelberg School adopted a direct and impressionistic style of painting. They regularly painted landscapes ''[[en plein air]]'', and sought to depict daily life. They showed a keen interest in the effects of lighting, and experimented with a variety of brushstroke techniques. Unlike the more radical approach of the French Impressionists, the Heidelberg School painters often maintained some degree of academic emphasis on form, clarity and composition. The latter group had little direct contact with the former; for example, it was not until 1907 that McCubbin saw their works in person, which is reflected in his evolution towards a looser, more abstracted style.

The Heidelberg School painters were not merely following an international trend, but "were interested in making paintings that looked distinctly Australian".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/australianimpressionism/education/qa_later_prepare.html Australian Impressionism: Education Resource], National Gallery of Victoria. Retrieved 16 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Works of the Heidelberg School are generally viewed as some of the first in Western art to realistically and sensitively depict [[The bush|the Australian landscape]] as it actually exists. The works of many earlier colonial artists look more like European scenes and do not reflect Australia's harsh sunlight, earthier colours and distinctive vegetation.

Writing in 1980, Australian artist and scholar [[Ian Burn]] described the Heidelberg School as "mediating the relation to the bush of most people growing up in Australia. ... Perhaps no other local imagery is so much a part of an Australian consciousness and ideological make-up."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Burn|Burn, Ian]].

Heidelberg School artworks are among the most collectible in Australian art; in 1995, the [[National Gallery of Australia]] acquired Streeton's ''[[Golden Summer, Eaglemont]]'' (1889) for $3.5 million, then a record price for an Australian painting.&lt;ref&gt;Strickland, Katrina.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4020">{{History of Ivory Coast}}
On December 4, 1958, [[Ivory Coast]] became a member state within the [[French Community]]. On August 7, 1960, Ivory Coast achieved its full independence from [[France]], and [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] became the first president after the independence.

== Houphouët-Boigny ==

The policies of [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]], compared with the post-colonial leaders of other African countries, were more pro-Western. Houphouët-Boigny maintained a closed political allegiance to the West while many other leaders turned to the communist camp. After independence, Houphouët-Boigny maintained a close relation with France. Ivory Coast had a growing French expatriate community, and many of the French expatriates provided Ivory Coast technical assistance. Besides in economic issues, cooperation with France was also established in military issues. Houphouët-Boigny considered the permanent presence of French force as a protection which guaranteed the security of the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rfi.fr/fichiers/MFI/PolitiqueDiplomatie/708.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Houphouët-Boigny maintained a one-party regime. However, he often employed softer and less direct tactics to maintain his power and dictatorship. He would win over his political opponents by bringing them into the ruling party, giving compromises, offering cooperation, etc. However, every political party was banned except his own party, [[Democratic Party of Côte d'Ivoire]] (PDCI). Fėlix Houphouët-Boigny had won every presidential elections since the independence to his death in 1993.

Under his government, Ivory Coast took the course of liberal free market economy and expanded its [[cash crop]] sector. It became one of the largest producers of [[coffee]] and [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]] in the world. In 1955, ''[[Caisse de Stabilisation et de Soutien des Prix Agricoles]]'' (CAISTAB) was founded to control the prices of coffee and cocoa. By the early 1980s Ivory Coast had one of the highest per capita incomes among those Sub-Saharan states without [[petroleum]]. This was termed the "[[Ivorian miracle]]".

However, in the 1980s, the prices of coffee and cocoa plunged. Equipped with a price stability fund, the government pledged to pay the price difference if farmers did not get enough prices at market for their products. However, the prices continued to drop, the fund quickly dried, subsidies to farmers had to be cut, and the external debt of Ivory Coast rose. As revenues fell, the government was forced to adjust its expense. The government funding was cut in many areas, particularly in education. Protests led by civil servants and students forced the government to hold elections and adopt a multi-party system in 1990.

The two major political parties in the 1990 election were the [[Ivorian Popular Front]] (FPI), founded by [[Laurent Gbagbo]], and the ruling PDCI. Houphouët-Boigny won the first multi-party presidential election in 1990, with more than 80 percent of the vote. However, he died soon afterwards in 1993.

== Bédié ==

[[Henri Konan Bédié]] succeeded Houphouët-Boigny as the president. The economic situation was still unstable. Bédié was accused of corruption, political repression. He adopted nationalist and xenophobic policies such as "[[Ivoirité]]", which disfavored many people with immigrant background. The tension within Ivory Coast kept growing. On December 23, 1999, a group of soldiers rebelled. Bédié was overthrown in the [[1999 Ivorian coup d'état|coup d'état]] of the following day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19271">{{Campaignbox Laotian Civil War}}
'''Kou Kiet''' (translation: Redeem Honor; also called Operation About Face) was a major [[Laotian Civil War]] victory for the anti-communist troops of the [[Kingdom of Laos]]. Patterned after prior [[Operation Raindance]], it depended upon extensive air strikes blasting communist units and clearing them from the path of the Royalist offensive. Powered by 150 daylight and 50 night sorties daily, with 50 to 80 day strikes directed by [[Raven Forward Air Controllers]], ''Kou Kiet'' ran from 6 August to 30 September 1969. It was successful beyond expectations. After the [[Royal Lao Government]] troops achieved their objectives, General [[Vang Pao]] insisted on pushing forward while they had the initiative. As a result, the Royalists regained control of the entire Plain of Jars while also capturing a huge stock of munitions from the communists. Their triumph came at a cost. However successful the Royalists were, by battle's end their battle-worn forces had exhausted their pool of potential recruits, while the Vietnamese could easily replace their personnel losses.

==Overview==

After World War II, France fought the [[First Indochina War]] to retain [[French Indochina]]. As part of its loss of that war at [[Dien Ben Phu]], it freed the [[Kingdom of Laos]]. Laotian neutrality was established in the [[Geneva Agreements|1954 Geneva Agreements]]. When France withdrew most of its military in conformity with the treaty, the United States filled the vacuum with purportedly civilian [[paramilitary]] instructors.&lt;ref&gt;Castle, pp. 7–12, 15–18.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[North Vietnam]]ese-backed communist insurrection began as early as 1949. Invading during the opium harvest season of 1953, it settled in northeastern Laos adjacent to the border of the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;Dommen, pp. 30&amp;ndash;34.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Laotian Civil War]] flared, the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] established a secret guerrilla army in the [[Plain of Jars]]. Interposed between the communist settlement around [[Xam Neua]] and the [[Royal Lao Government]] in Vientiane, the [[Hmong (people)|Hmong]] [[Irregular military|military irregulars]] fought to hold on to their traditional territory, and to preserve Laos.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, pp. 44–47&lt;/ref&gt; After the failure and defeat of [[Operation Pigfat]] and [[Operation Raindance]] in early 1969, the communists had overrun the Plain of Jars to within ten kilometers of the guerrillas' main base at [[Long Chieng]]. As a riposte, Hmong General [[Vang Pao]] plotted another spoiling offensive against the pressing communists. However, the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) beat him to it with [[Campaign Thoan Thang]]. After the Vietnamese campaign ran its course, Vang Pao launched yet another inconclusive offensive that failed to clear the foe from the Plain of Jars, [[Operation Off Balance]].&lt;ref&gt;Warner, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conboy, Morrison, pp. 210–211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, Sexton, pp. 298, 300.&lt;/ref&gt; By 28 June 1969, the PAVN had 60 tanks deployed. Additionally, there were seven new Vietnamese infantry battalions poised on the Plain, while the Royalist remained unreinforced. The PAVN now had a total of 26 battalions in the Plain of Jars area, seemingly poised for a further wet season offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Ahern, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, Sexton, pp. 307–309.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Kou Kiet''==

===Preliminaries===

The [[monsoon]] rains that had crippled the air support for [[Operation Off Balance]], and [[Operation Pigfat]] before that, now began to clear to favor Vang Pao and his forces. With about triple the usual rainfall for the month of July, communist ground [[logistics]] began to bog down, often quite literally. Conversely, Vang Pao's troops were being amply supplied via [[Airbridge (logistics)|air bridge]]; brand new [[M16 rifle]]s were being secretively provided for his troops.&lt;ref name=conboy214/&gt;

Also, U.S. Air Force tactical air strikes with area denial munitions forced the PAVN supply efforts off the main road. However, to the opposing Royalist forces, the PAVN still remained a threatening force in being to the ancestral Hmong territory south of the Plain of Jars. In late July 1969, as Off Balance was still being fought, Vang Pao plotted a diversionary attack against the PAVN's main supply road, Route 7.&lt;ref name=conboy214/&gt; Suspicious of leaky security among the Royal Lao Army command, Vang Pao demanded CIA-supported guerrillas for his next offensive. His insistence was problematic, as he lacked the needed manpower in his own CIA guerrilla army. In an unprecedented move, guerrillas were transferred in from other Military Regions.&lt;ref&gt;Ahern, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hmong general called the new offensive operation ''Kou Kiet'' (Redeemed Honor). His CIA contacts dubbed it Operation About Face when they approved it.&lt;ref name=conboy214&gt;Conboy, Morrison, pp. 214–217.&lt;/ref&gt; No matter the name, it was patterned on the previous Operation Raindance, planned as a three-week attack with the major firepower being tactical air. Newly arrived Ambassador [[G. McMurtrie Godley]] messaged his superiors in the [[U.S. State Department]] that the military situation on the Plain of Jars was so crucial that if [[fighter-bomber]]s would not suffice for ''Kou Kiet'', [[Operation Arc Light|Arc Light]] strikes by [[B-52]]s should be considered as a followup.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, Sexton, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was planned as a two phase operation. The first phase was a helilift of two battalions to a ridgeline overlooking Nong Pet, which oversaw Route 70. From there, both the Royalist battalion of regulars and the Hmong Special Guerrilla Unit would attack and block Route 7. The second phase would involve three battalions of [[Royal Lao Army]] and five battalions of [[irregulars]]. They were to be helicoptered in to take up positions on two mountains that overlooked the southern Plain of Jars. This latter movement seemed beyond Royalist capabilities; both his CIA advisors and Prime Minister [[Souvanna Phouma]] cautioned him about it. However, the Hmong general pressed forward with his plans, even persuading both Military Region 3 and Military Region 4 to loan him a guerrilla battalion each. ''Kou Kiet'' was due to launch on 3 August.&lt;ref name=conboy214/&gt; Although the PAVN outnumbered the Hmong and had superior fighting power, it was believed that air power during favorable weather conditions would tip the balance to the Royalists.&lt;ref&gt;Ahern, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; Planning 150 tactical air strikes during daylight, and 50 strikes per night, the U.S. Air Force could count on [[Raven FACs]] to spot for and direct 50 to 80 sorties per day [[close air support]] for the Royalist guerrillas.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, Sexton, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase one===

After a hold because of bad weather, the offensive kicked off during a heavy rain on 6 August 1969.&lt;ref name=ahern326&gt;Ahern, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; With the new troops available from other Military Regions, the operational planning had shifted to a pincer movement for phase one. Blue Battalion from Military Region 3 was coptered into [[Covert sites of the Laotian Civil War|Bouamlong]], north of Route 7, to be joined by local [[Auto Defense Choc]] militia. They were to march south toward the Nong Pet road junction. The other pincer was landed by [[STOL|short takeoff and landing]] aircraft at San Tiau, southeast of Route 7. This makeshift force was made up of Military Region 4's battalion-sized 2nd Special Guerrilla Unit, Military Region 2's ''Bataillon Volontaires 27'' (Volunteer Battalion 27), plus some ADC guerrillas. Despite the weather hold, the attack began in heavy rain.&lt;ref name=conboy214/&gt;

As a result, the northern contingent was bogged down for about a week before helicopters could move them to Nong Pet. At about the same date, on 19 August, the southern pincer took the ridge overseeing Nong Pet that was their objective. Four days later, the northern task force had moved within eight kilometers of Nong Pet.&lt;ref name=conboy214/&gt;

The People's Army of Vietnam had offered no organized resistance to the Royalist incursion. Road watch teams, plus implanted spy sensors, both reported that no trucks bearing supplies for the communists had made it down Route 7 onto the Plain of Jars since the attacks began. Encouraged by his success, and by the lack of opposition, Vang Pao launched Phase two of his plan.&lt;ref name=conboy214/&gt;

===Phase two===

Building on success, on 20 August Vang Pao expanded his offensive. He continued to plan on a two-pronged operation. As before, there was a northern column. Two battalions of Royalist regular volunteers—''Bataillon Volontaires 21'' and ''Bataillon Volontaires 24''—were stiffened with the ''101 Bataillon Parachutistes'' (101st Paratroop Battalion). This probe moved northeastward from Ban Na; their immediate objective was Moung Phanh. The second column, moving in from the south, consisted of two regimental-size units of guerrillas, ''Groupe Mobile 22'' and ''Groupe Mobile 23''. Most of the ''Kou Kiet'' troops were armed with M16s.&lt;ref name=conboy214/&gt;

GM 22 and GM 23 marched northward without opposition through the marshy southern edge of the Plain of Jars for five days, GM 22 leading, GM 23 trailing. Then GM 22 split in two; part of the unit swerved eastward on its own axis of advance. The two prongs of GM 22 would reunite at the Lat Houang junction of Routes 4 and 5 by the end of August. There they found a feast of abandoned livestock. On 31 August, the U.S. Air Force began five days of spraying [[defoliant]] on communist-held rice paddies on the plain.&lt;ref name=conboy214/&gt; The ongoing success of the campaign was credited to air power. Besides the heavy daily contribution of 140 sorties per day of the U.S. Air Force, fewer than 30 Royal Lao Air Force [[AT-28]]s flew over 90 sorties per day of [[close air support]].&lt;ref name=ahern326/&gt;

By 1 September, there had been no real opposition from the foe. Of the 18 communist battalions that had been occupying the Plain of Jars, only two weren't Pathet Lao.&lt;ref name=ahern326/&gt; A Vietnamese [[prisoner of war]] revealed that the communists planned no new offensive until arrival of the dry season. On 4 September, a captured PAVN officer described his 400-man unit and six tanks as being trapped when they attempted withdrawal back along Route 7 to North Vietnam. Most unusually for the highly disciplined PAVN, the unit broke, scattered, and fled. At about this time, Vang Pao realized he could extend his offensive still further.&lt;ref name=conboy214/&gt;

===Phase two, part two===

By 5 September, the Hmong [[Irregular military|irregulars]] moved north onto the Plain of Jars, overrunning huge hoards of military materiel, including a fleet of [[PT-76]] tanks. Continuing onwards, still uncontested, on 9 September GM 22 captured Khang Khay. Even as they were doing so, GM 23 swung into action. Two of its battalions captured [[Phou Khe]] and [[Phonsavan]] on 12 September; the third relieved GM 22 at Khang Khay. GM 22 advanced one kilometer northwest to occupy a cavern containing a Pathet Lao radio station, and other materiel.&lt;ref name=conboy214/&gt;

Vang Pao brought more fresh troops to his campaign, a mixture of Royalist regulars and Hmong irregulars. On 18 September, ''Bataillon Volontaires 21'' and a force of the hill tribe guerrillas captured Phou San and nearby foothills. Here, for the first time, the RLG troops met resistance. After the communists managed to block the Royalist advance for two days. the latter were reinforced by a regiment, ''Groupe Mobile 21''. GM 21 was tasked with seizing the high ground at Phou Keng in a night assault. They took it on 24 September, granting them surveillance of the northern end of the Plain of Jars.&lt;ref name=conboy214/&gt;

With the Plain of Jars largely under RLG control, a scratch force of seven ''Auto Defense Choc'' militia companies closed in on the PAVN troops stranded in [[Muang Soui]]. On the last day of September, two ADC companies occupied Muang Soui as the battered, starving Vietnamese faded into the jungle. Despite extensive bombing by the U.S. Air Force, most equipment there was undamaged, and untouched by the PAVN.&lt;ref name=conboy214/&gt;

At this point, it became apparent that communist resistance was forming. There were still three intact PAVN regiments in the vicinity; [[military intelligence]] reports heralded the arrival of the [[312th Division (Vietnam)|PAVN 312th Division]] from Vietnam. A PAVN counterattack on an SGU fixed position at Phou Nok Kok showed that the Vietnamese were willing to take heavy casualties to attrite the dwindling guerrilla forces.&lt;ref name="Ahern, p. 329"&gt;Ahern, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results of the operation==

During this operation, Vang Pao and his Hmong army became dependent on close air support to the point they were considered to be the first guerrillas in history to project [[air superiority]]. That dependence began to erode their fighting abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Conboy, Morrison, pp. 249 - 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time ''Kou Kiet'' ended on 30 September 1969, tactical air was credited with hitting 308 communist vehicles. The PAVN had fled, abandoning the Pathet Lao and their weak allies in the ''[[Forces Armées Neutralistes]]''. The Pathet Lao dispersed into the countryside, while the Neutralists refused combat and hastily retreated eastward to the border with the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]. One of the caches captured by the advancing Hmong contained 100 tons of munitions; another held 22 trucks. Falling into the conquerors' hands by the end of October were 25 tanks, 113 vehicles with over 800,000 liters of fuel, more than 6,400 weapons, almost six million rounds of ammunition, and five days rations for the entire PAVN force.&lt;ref&gt;Conboy, Morrison, pp. 203, 205.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of materiel captured, ''Kou Kiet'' was the greatest haul yet in the Second Indochina War.&lt;ref name=conboy248&gt;Conboy, Morrison, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; The loss jarred the PAVN into changing their previous tactics of stockpiling supplies close to their front line troops before an offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Ahern, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, with the width of the plain separating the communists from the main guerrilla bases, the latter were no longer besieged. In addition to the tremendous stores of military materiel captured by the RLG, 20,000 inhabitants of the Plain were removed, depriving the communists of [[Porter (carrier)|porter]]s to move their supplies. The Plain of Jars was now clearly under RLG control for the first time in almost a year.&lt;ref name=conboy214/&gt; However, the Hmong guerrilla attack suffered from success; the irregulars had outrun the planned limits of the campaign and pushed into an area designated for area denial ordnance. As a result, U.S. Air Force pilots could not drop mines to seal off the Vietnamese incursions due to the presence of friendly troops.&lt;ref&gt;Conboy, Morrison, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

Even as ''Kou Kiet'' was grinding to its finish, General [[Võ Nguyên Giáp]] issued orders on 13 September for an upcoming PAVN dry season attack in Military Region 2, dubbed [[Campaign 139]]. A preliminary battalion-sized retaliatory probe on 29 November pushed ''Bataillon Volontaires 21'' and its Hmong auxiliaries off their mountaintop strongpoint. The Hmong, who were transitioning from classic guerrillas to [[light infantry]], suffered irreplaceable increased casualties as a result.&lt;ref name="Ahern, p. 329"/&gt; General Vang Pao's forces had dwindled to about 5,000&lt;ref&gt;Ahern, p, 331.&lt;/ref&gt; to 5,500 effectives. The Pathet Lao outnumbered them, with about 6,000 under arms. PAVN, on the other hand, could muster 16,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, Sexton, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, while the Vietnamese replenished their losses, the Hmong were hard pressed to find recruits to replace their casualties.&lt;ref name=conboy214/&gt;

Refugee relief worker [[Pop Buell]] left an account of recruiting Hmong replacements: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;...we rounded up three hundred fresh recruits. Thirty percent were fourteen years old or less, and ten of them were only ten years old. Another thirty percent were fifteen or sixteen. The remaining forty percent were forty-five or over. Where were the ones in between? I'll tell you—they're all dead.&lt;ref&gt;Tapp, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Pathet Lao communists held rural territory largely barren of population for replacements; their forces had dwindled to battalions of about 150 men. By comparison, the Vietnamese could hypothetically replace 10,000 casualties per year for the next 14 years in the northern Laotian fighting, while Laotian forces could expect few or no replacements.&lt;ref name=conboy248/&gt;

A planned three-week offensive had stretched into three and a half months. The Royalist irregular troops were exhausted by their successful drive. The mismatch in troops made them obviously unable to hold the ground they had captured. The American Embassy backers of the operation recommended that the guerrillas plan a step by step withdrawal back across the Plain of Jars, retreating through a series of four static lines. Key to the original defensive line was Phou Nok Kok. The PAVN attacked Phou Nok Kok's 600 man garrison throughout December, suffering an estimated 400 killed in action and 1,000 wounded, mostly inflicted by close air support. As bad flying weather curtailed air support for the Royalists during January 1971, the communists continued their attacks. On 12 January 1971, after a six-week defense that cost the PAVN about 600 killed, and despite the initial use of RLAF [[AC-47]] gunships for support, the Hmong guerrillas withdrew from the stronghold. They had suffered 12 killed. With the loss of Phou Nok Kok, which barred the eastern entry to the Plain, the Royalists were forced to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, Sexton, pp. 323 - 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, ''Kou Kiet'' was dubbed "the first major victory in the history of the Royal Lao Government".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, Sexton, p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Loren Eiseley''' (September 3, 1907 – July 9, 1977) was an American [[anthropologist]], [[educator]], [[philosopher]], and [[natural science]] writer, who taught and published books from the 1950s through the 1970s. He received many [[honorary degree]]s and was a fellow of multiple professional societies. At his death, he was Benjamin Franklin Professor of Anthropology and History of Science at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

He was a "scholar and writer of imagination and grace," whose reputation and accomplishments extended far beyond the campus where he taught for 30 years. ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' referred to him as "the modern [[Thoreau]]." The broad scope of his writing reflected upon such topics as the mind of [[Sir Francis Bacon]], the [[prehistoric]] origins of man, and the contributions of [[Charles Darwin]].

Eiseley's reputation was established primarily through his books, including ''The Immense Journey'' (1957), ''Darwin's Century'' (1958), ''The Unexpected Universe'' (1969), ''The Night Country'' (1971), and his memoir, ''All the Strange Hours'' (1975). Science author [[Orville Prescott]] praised him as a scientist who "can write with poetic sensibility and with a fine sense of wonder and of reverence before the mysteries of life and nature." Naturalist author Mary Ellen Pitts saw his combination of literary and nature writings as his "quest, not simply for bringing together science and literature... but a continuation of what the 18th and 19th century British naturalists and Thoreau had done." In praise of "The Unexpected Universe", [[Ray Bradbury]] remarked, "[Eiseley] is every writer's writer, and every human's human... One of us, yet most uncommon..."  
 
According to his obituary in the ''[[New York Times]]'', the feeling and philosophical motivation of the entire body of Eiseley's work was best expressed in one of his essays, ''The Enchanted Glass:'' "The anthropologist wrote of the need for the contemplative [[naturalist]], a man who, in a less frenzied era, had time to observe, to speculate, and to dream."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;Blum, Howard. ''Loren Eiseley, Anthropologist, 69; Eloquent Writer on Man and Nature'', ''New York Times'', (Obituary) July 11, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before his death he received an award from the [[Boston Museum of Science]] for his "outstanding contribution to the public understanding of science" and another from the U.S. [[Humane Society]] for his "significant contribution for the improvement of life and environment in this country."

==Early life==
Born in [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], [[Nebraska]], Eiseley lived his childhood with a hardworking father and deaf mother who may have suffered from [[mental illness]]. Their home was located on the outskirts of town where, as author Naomi Brill writes, it was "removed from the people and the community from which they felt set apart through poverty and family misfortune."&lt;ref name=Brill&gt;Brill, Naomi. [http://www.eiseley.org/biography.php Loren Eiseley Society (LES)]&lt;/ref&gt; His autobiography, ''All the Strange Hours'', begins with his "childhood experiences as a sickly afterthought, weighed down by the loveless union of his parents."&lt;ref name=Strange/&gt;

His father, Clyde, was a hardware salesman who worked long hours for little pay, writes Brill. However, as an amateur [[Shakespearean]] actor, he was able to give his son a "love for beautiful language and writing."&lt;ref name=Brill /&gt; His mother, Daisey Corey, was a self-taught prairie artist who was considered a beautiful woman. She lost her hearing as a child and sometimes exhibited irrational and destructive behavior. This left Eiseley feeling distant from her and may have contributed to his parents' unhappy marriage.

Living at the edge of town, however, led to Eiseley's early interest in the natural world, to which he turned when being at home was too difficult. There, he would play in the caves and creek banks nearby.&lt;ref name=Minn&gt;[[Minnesota State University, Mankato|Minnesota State University]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20100603182329/https://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/abcde/eiseley_loren.html EMuseum's Eiseley biography] ([[Internet Archive]] of website defunct since 2011), Retrieved 2015-10-16&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, there were others who opened the door to a happier life. His half-brother, Leo, for instance, gave him a copy of ''[[Robinson Crusoe (novel)|Robinson Crusoe]]'', with which he taught himself to read. Thereafter, he managed to find ways to get to the public library and became a voracious reader.&lt;ref name=Brill/&gt;

Eiseley later attended the Lincoln Public Schools; in high school, he wrote that he wanted to be a [[nature writer]]. He would later describe the lands around Lincoln as "flat and grass-covered and smiling so serenely up at the sun that they seemed forever youthful, untouched by mind or time&amp;mdash;a sunlit, timeless prairie over which nothing passed but antelope or wandering bird."&lt;ref name=Strange/&gt; But, disturbed by his home situation and the illness and recent death of his father, he dropped out of school and worked at menial jobs.

Eiseley enrolled in the [[University of Nebraska]], where he wrote for the newly formed journal, ''[[Prairie Schooner]]'', and went on [[archaeology]] digs for the school's [[natural history]] [[museum]], [[University of Nebraska State Museum|Morrill Hall]].&lt;ref name=Brill/&gt;  In 1927, however, he was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and left the university to move to the western [[desert]], believing the drier air would improve his condition. While there, he soon became restless and unhappy, which led him to hoboing around the country by hopping on freight trains (as many did during the [[Great Depression]]).&lt;ref name=Strange&gt;Eiseley, Loren. ''All the Strange Hours'', (1975) Scribner&lt;/ref&gt;  Professor of religion, Richard Wentz, writes about this period:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Loren Eiseley had been a drifter in his youth. From the plains of Nebraska he had wandered across the American West. Sometimes sickly, at other times testing his strength with that curious band of roving exiles who searched the land above the rippling railroad ties, he explored his soul as he sought to touch the distant past. He became a naturalist and a bone hunter because something about the landscape had linked his mind to the birth and death of life itself.&lt;ref name=Wentz&gt;Wentz, Richard E., [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1391 The American Spirituality of Loren Eiseley] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007182240/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1391 |date=2009-10-07 }} ''Christian Century'', April 25, 1984,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Academic career==
Eiseley eventually returned to the University of Nebraska and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in [[English studies|English]] and a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in [[Geology]]/[[Anthropology]]. While at the university, he served as editor of the literary magazine ''The Prairie Schooner'', and published his poetry and short stories. Undergraduate expeditions to western Nebraska and the southwest to hunt for fossils and human artifacts provided the inspiration for much of his early work. He later noted that he came to anthropology from paleontology, preferring to leave human burial sites undisturbed unless destruction threatened them.

Eiseley received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1937 and wrote his dissertation entitled "Three Indices of Quaternary Time and Their Bearing Upon Pre-History: a Critique", which launched his academic career.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; He began teaching at the [[University of Kansas]] that same year. During [[World War II]], Eiseley taught anatomy to reservist pre-med students at Kansas.

In 1944 he left the University of Kansas to assume the role of head of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at [[Oberlin College]] in [[Ohio]]. In 1947 he returned to the University of Pennsylvania to head its Anthropology Department. He was elected president of the American Institute of Human [[Paleontology]] in 1949. From 1959 to 1961, he was [[Provost (education)|provost]] at the University of Pennsylvania, and in 1961 the University of Pennsylvania created a special interdisciplinary professorial chair for him.

Eiseley was also a fellow of many distinguished professional societies, including the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]] and the [[American Philosophical Society]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

At the time of his death in 1977, he was Benjamin Franklin Professor of Anthropology and History of Science, and the curator of the Early Man section at the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]].&lt;ref name=Penn&gt;University of Pennsylvania Almanac, [http://www.upenn.edu/almanac/volumes/v54/n10/eiseley.html Loren Eiseley’s 100th Birthday Celebration at the Penn Museum] October 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  He had received thirty-six [[honorary degrees]] over a period of twenty years, and was the most honored member of the University of Pennsylvania since [[Benjamin Franklin]]. In 1976 he won the [[Bradford Washburn]] Award of the [[Boston Museum of Science]] for his "outstanding contribution to the public understanding of science" and the [[Joseph Wood Krutch]] Medal from the [[Humane Society of the United States]] for his "significant contribution for the improvement of life and the environment in this country."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Books==
In addition to his scientific and academic work, Eiseley began in the mid-1940s to publish the essays which brought him to the attention of a wider audience. Anthropologist Pat Shipman writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;the words that flowed from his pen... the images and insights he revealed, the genius of the man as a writer, outweigh his social disability. The words were what kept him in various honored posts; the words were what caused the students to flock to his often aborted courses; the words were what earned him esteemed lectureships and prizes. His contemporaries failed to see the duality of the man, confusing the deep, wise voice of Eiseley's writings with his own personal voice. He was a natural fugitive, a fox at the wood's edge (in his own metaphor)...&lt;ref name=Shipman&gt;Shipman, Pat. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D7113EF93AA2575BC0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print An Anthropologist With Bite]''New York Times'', August 19, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eiseley published works in a number of different genres including poetry, autobiography, history of science, biography, and nonfictional essays. In each piece of writing, he consistently used a poetic writing style. Eiseley's style mirrors what he called the concealed essay—a piece of writing that unites the personal dimension with more scientific thoughts.&lt;ref name=Wisner&gt;Wisner, William. "The Perilous Self: Loren Eiseley And The Reticence Of Autobiography." Sewanee Review 113.1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; His writing was unique in that it could convey complex ideas about human origin and the relationship between humans and the natural world to a nonscientific audience. Robert G. Franke describes Eiseley's essays as theatrical and dramatic. He also notes the influence his father's hobby as an amateur [[Shakespearean]] actor may have had on Eiseley's writing, pointing out that his essays often contain dramatic elements that are usually present in plays.&lt;ref name=Franke&gt;Franke, Robert. Journal of American Culture. "A Great Stage, A Great Play: The Theatrical And Tragic In Loren Eiseley's Essays.", 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In describing Eiseley's writing, Richard Wentz wrote, "As the works of any naturalist might, Eiseley's essays and poems deal with the flora and fauna of [[North America]]. They probe the concept of evolution, which consumed so much of his scholarly attention, examining the bones and shards, the arrowpoints and buried treasures. Every scientific observation leads to reflection." &lt;ref name=Wentz /&gt;

In an interview on [[National Public Radio]] (NPR), author [[Michael Lind]] said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Before the rise of a self-conscious intelligentsia, most educated people &amp;ndash; as well as the unlettered majority &amp;ndash; spent most of their time in the countryside or, if they lived in cities, were a few blocks away from farmland or wilderness... At the risk of sounding countercultural, I suspect that thinkers who live in sealed, air-conditioned boxes and work by artificial light (I am one) are as unnatural as apes in cages at zoos. Naturalists like Eiseley in that sense are the most normal human beings to be found among intellectuals, because they spend a lot of time outdoors and know the names of the plants and animals they see... For all of his scientific erudition, Eiseley has a poetic, even cinematic, imagination.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;Lind, Michael. [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5634196&amp;live=1 NPR radio interview], October 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Purposes of his writings===
Richard Wentz describes what he feels are the significance and purposes of Eiseley's writings:&lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;"For Loren Eiseley, writing itself becomes a form of contemplation. Contemplation is a kind of human activity in which the mind, spirit and body are directed in solitude toward some other. Scholars and critics have not yet taken the full measure of contemplation as an art that is related to the purpose of all scholarly activity &amp;ndash; to see things as they really are... Using narrative, parable and exposition, Eiseley has the uncanny ability to make us feel that we are accompanying him on a journey into the very heart of the universe. Whether he is explicating history or commenting on the ideas of a philosopher, a scientist or a theologian, he takes us with him on a personal visit."

However, because of Eiseley's intense and poetic writing style and his focus on nature and [[cosmology]], he was not accepted or understood by most of his colleagues. "You," a friend told him, "are a freak, you know. A God-damned freak, and life is never going to be easy for you. You like scholarship, but the scholars, some of them, anyhow, are not going to like you because you don't stay in the hole where God supposedly put you. You keep sticking your head out and looking around. In a university that's inadvisable." &lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

===1950s===
;''The Immense Journey'' (1957)
His first book, ''The Immense Journey'', was a collection of writings about the history of humanity, and it proved to be that rare science book that appealed to a mass audience. It has sold over a million copies and has been published in at least 16 languages.&lt;ref name=proclamation/&gt; Besides being his first book, ''The Immense Journey'' was also Eiseley's most well known book and established him as a writer with the ability to combine science and humanity in a poetic way.&lt;ref name=Brill /&gt; This book was originally published in 1946.&lt;ref name=Brill /&gt; Then, it was published again in 1957, a few years after the [[Piltdown Man]] hoax discovery.

In the book Eiseley conveys his sense of wonder at the depth of time and the vastness of the universe. He uses his own experiences, reactions to the paleontological record, and wonderment at the world to address the topic of evolution. More specifically, the text concentrates on human evolution and human ignorance. In ''The Immense Journey'', Eiseley follows the journey from human ignorance at the beginning of life to his own wonderment about the future of mankind. [[Marston Bates]] writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It seems to me... that Eiseley is looking at man in a quite hard-headed fashion, because he is willing to sketch problems for which he has no present and sure solution. We are not going to find the answers in human evolution until we have framed the right questions, and the questions are difficult because they involve both body and mind, physique and culture—tools and symbols as well as cerebral configurations.&lt;ref name=Bates&gt;Bates, Marston. "Science", 1958&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Author Orville Prescott wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Consider the case of Loren Eiseley, author of ''The Immense Journey'', who can sit on a mountain slope beside a prairie-dog town and imagine himself back in the dawn of the [[Age of mammals]] eighty million years ago:  'There by a tree root I could almost make him out, that shabby little [[Paleocene]] rat, eternal tramp and world wanderer, father of all mankind.' ... his prose is often lyrically beautiful, something that considerable reading in the works of anthropologists had not led me to expect. ... The subjects discussed here include the human ancestral tree, water and its significance to life, the mysteries of cellular life, 'the secret and remote abysses' of the sea, the riddle of why human beings alone among living creatures have brains capable of abstract thought and are far superior to their mere needs for survival, the reasons why Dr. Eiseley is convinced that there are no men or man-like animals on other planets, ....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He offers an example of Eiseley's style: "There is no logical reason for the existence of a snowflake any more than there is for evolution. It is an apparition from that mysterious shadow world beyond nature, that final world which contains&amp;mdash;if anything contains&amp;mdash;the explanation of men and catfish and green leaves."&lt;ref name=Prescott&gt;Prescott, Orville. "Books of the Times," ''New York Times'', December 27, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Darwin's Century'' (1958)
This book's subtitle is, "Evolution and the Men Who Discovered It." Eiseley documented that animal variation, extinction, and a lengthy history of the earth were observed from the 1600s onward. Scientists groped towards a theory with increasingly detailed observations. They became aware that evolution had occurred without knowing how. Evolution was "in the air" and part of the intellectual discourse both before and after ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was published. The publisher describes it thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the heart of the account is Charles Darwin, but the story neither begins nor ends with him. Starting with the seventeenth-century notion of the [[Great Chain of Being]], Dr. Eiseley traces the achievements and discoveries of men in many fields of science who paved the way for Darwin; and the book concludes with an extensive discussion of the ways in which Darwin's work has been challenged, improved upon, and occasionally refuted during the past hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;''Darwin's Century,'' back cover&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Persons whose contributions are discussed include [[Sir Thomas Browne]], [[Sir Francis Bacon]], [[Carl Linnaeus]],  [[Benoît de Maillet]], the [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]], [[Erasmus Darwin]], [[Louis Agassiz]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], [[James Hutton]], [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]], [[Georges Cuvier]], [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], [[Sir Charles Lyell]], [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], [[William Charles Wells|William Wells]], [[Patrick Matthew]], [[Karl von Baer]], [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]], [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], [[John Richardson (naturalist)|Sir John Richardson]], [[Alexander Humboldt]], [[Gregor Mendel]], [[Hugo De Vries]], [[Wilhelm Johannsen|W. L. Johannsen]], [[Adolphe Quetelet|Lambert Quételet]], and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]. Critics discussed include [[Fleeming Jenkin]], [[Alfred William Bennett|A.W. Bennett]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]], and [[Adam Sedgwick]], both a mentor and a critic.&lt;ref&gt;''Darwin's Century'' as a whole&lt;/ref&gt;

According to naturalist author Mary Ellen Pitts, in the "seminal" ''Darwin's Century'', Eiseley was studying the history of evolutionary thinking, and he came to see that "as a result of scientific studies, nature has become externalized, particularized, mechanized, separated from the human and fragmented, reduced to conflict without consideration of cooperation, confined to [[reductionist]] and [[positivist]] study." The results for humankind, "as part of the '[[Biota (ecology)|biota]]' &amp;ndash; Eiseley's concern as a writer &amp;ndash; are far reaching." In the book, his unique impact as a thinker and a literary figure emerges as he reexamines science and the way man understands science. She concludes that, for Eiseley, "Nature emerges as a [[metonym]] for a view of the physical world, of the 'biota,' and of humankind that must be reexamined if life is to survive."&lt;ref name=Pitts&gt;Pitts, Mary Ellen. ''Toward a Dialogue of Understandings: Loren Eiseley and the Critique of Science'', Lehigh University Press (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his conclusion, Eiseley quotes Darwin: "If we choose to let conjecture run wild, then animals, our fellow brethren in pain, disease, suffering and famine&amp;mdash;our slaves in the most laborious works, our companions in our amusements&amp;mdash;they may partake of our origin in one common ancestor&amp;mdash;we may be all melted together." Eiseley adds, "If he had never conceived of natural selection, if he had never written the ''Origin,'' it would still stand as a statement of almost clairvoyant perception."&lt;ref&gt;''Darwin's Century,'' page 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book won the [[Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science|Phi Beta Kappa prize for best book in science]] in 1958.

===1960s===
;''The Firmament of Time'' (1960) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2UaKo_vGjRAC Read excerpts online]
In discussing ''The Firmament of Time'', Professor of Zoology Leslie Dunn wrote, "How can man of 1960, burdened with the knowledge of the world external to him, and with the consciousness that scientific knowledge is attained through continually interfering with nature, 'bear his part' and gain the hope and confidence to live in the new world to which natural science has given birth? ... The answer comes in the eloquent, moving central essay of his new book."&lt;ref name=Dunn&gt;Dunn, Leslie C. "Natural Law and Science," ''The New York Times'', August 7, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New Yorker'' wrote, "Dr. Eiseley describes with zest and admiration the giant steps that have led man, in a scant three hundred years, to grasp the nature of his extraordinary past and to substitute a natural world for a world of divine creation and intervention... An irresistible inducement to partake of the almost forgotten excitements of reflection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0803267398|title=The Firmament of Time|first1=Loren|last1=Eiseley|first2=Gary|last2=Holthaus|date=1 May 1999|publisher=Bison Books|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''The Chicago Tribune'' added, "[This book] has a warm feeling for all natural phenomena; it has a rapport with man and his world and his problems; ... it has hope and belief. And it has the beauty of prose that characterizes Eiseley's philosophical moods."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0803267398  ''Chicago Sunday Tribune'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Firmament of Time'' was awarded the 1961 [[John Burroughs]] Medal for the best publication in the field of Nature Writing.

{{see also|The Star Thrower}}

Poet [[W.H. Auden]] wrote, "The main theme of ''The Unexpected Universe'' is Man as the Quest Hero, the wanderer, the voyager, the seeker after adventure, knowledge, power, meaning, and righteousness."&lt;ref name=Auden&gt;Auden, W.H.[http://southerncrossreview.org/44/auden-eiseley.htm Introduction to ''The Star Thrower'']&lt;/ref&gt; He quotes from the book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every time we walk along a beach some ancient urge disturbs us so that we find ourselves shedding shoes and garments or scavenging among seaweed and whitened timbers like the homesick refugees of a long war... Mostly the animals understand their roles, but man, by comparison, seems troubled by a message that, it is often said, he cannot quite remember or has gotten wrong... Bereft of instinct, he must search continually for meanings... Man was a reader before he became a writer, a reader of what [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] once called the mighty alphabet of the universe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Evolutionary biologist [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] described Dr. Eiseley as

{{quote|...a [[Proust]] miraculously turned into an evolutionary anthropologist...", and science fiction novelist [[Ray Bradbury]] wrote glowing reviews of many of his books including this one. ... "Here he writes from a naturalist's perspective on the unexpected and symbolic aspects of the universe. Read about seeds, [[hieroglyphs]] on shells, the [[Ice Age]], lost tombs, city dumps and primitive Man. The underlying theme is the desolation and renewal of our planet's history and experience.

Loren Eiseley's dark, brooding prose is unique in the annals of nature writing. ''The Unexpected Universe'' features some of what are considered Eiseley's best essays. Heavily autobiographical and deeply personal, these essays are not cheerful ramblings on the joy of communing with nature. They are bleak, lonely musings on the human condition.}}

===1970s===
;''The Invisible Pyramid (1971) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ukuhJFtLugcC Read excerpts online]
Gregory McNamee of Amazon.com writes, "In 1910 young Loren Eiseley watched the passage of [[Halley's Comet]] with his father. The boy who became a famous naturalist was never again to see the spectacle except in his imagination. That childhood event contributed to the profound sense of time and space that marks ''The Invisible Pyramid''. This collection of essays, first published shortly after Americans landed on the moon, explores inner and outer space, the vastness of the cosmos, and the limits of what can be known. Bringing poetic insight to scientific discipline, Eiseley makes connections between civilizations past and present, multiple universes, humankind, and nature.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Eiseley took the occasion of the lunar landing to consider how far humans had to go in understanding their own small corner of the universe, their home planet, much less what he called the 'cosmic prison' of space. Likening humans to the microscopic phagocytes that dwell within our bodies, he grumpily remarks, 'We know only a little more extended reality than the hypothetical creature below us. Above us may lie realms it is beyond our power to grasp.' Science, he suggests, would be better put to examining that which lies immediately before us, although he allows that the quest to explore space is so firmly rooted in Western technological culture that it was unlikely to be abandoned simply because of his urging. Eiseley's opinion continues to be influential among certain environmentalists, and these graceful essays show why that should be so.&lt;ref&gt;McNamee, Gregory [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/080326738X Amazon.com book description]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Book excerpt:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Man would not be man if his dreams did not exceed his grasp. ... Like [[John Donne]], man lies in a close prison, yet it is dear to him. Like Donne's, his thoughts at times overleap the sun and pace beyond the body. If I term humanity a [[slime mold]] organism it is because our present environment suggest it. If I remember the sunflower forest it is because from its hidden reaches man arose. The green world is his sacred center. In moments of sanity he must still seek refuge there. ... If I dream by contrast of the eventual drift of the star voyagers through the dilated time of the universe, it is because I have seen [[thistle]]down off to new worlds and am at heart a voyager who, in this modern time, still yearns for the lost country of his birth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;''The Night Country (1971) [https://books.google.com/books?id=hsf0wbVJz8wC Read excerpts online]
[[Kirkus Reviews]] wrote,

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;like the medievalists, Eiseley reads nature as the second book of God's revelation, mysterious and heavy with latent, lurking fertility. His sizable audience should welcome the latest voyage in search of the secret springs of creativity - evolutionary, cosmic, mental - as a muted adumbration of temporal mortality." Other reviews: "Eiseley has met strange creatures in the night country, and he tells marvelous stories about them ... For Eiseley, storytelling is never pure entertainment. The autobiographical tales keep illustrating the theses that wind through all his writing - the fallibility of science, the mystery of evolution, the surprise of life.|''Time Magazine''}}

In a published essay, University of Pennsylvania alumnus Carl Hoffman wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;An old man who had done almost all of his writing late, late at night, was speaking to a younger man who liked to read in those same dark hours. In a chapter entitled 'One Night's Dying,' Eiseley said to me: 'It is thus that one day and the next are welded together, and that one night's dying becomes tomorrow's birth. I, who do not sleep, can tell you this.'

;''All the Strange Hours: The Excavation of a Life'' (1975) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6vQ2WZQJoQ8C&amp;output=html Read excerpts online]
"In ''All the Strange Hours''," states Amazon.com,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Eiseley turns his considerable powers of reflection and discovery on his own life to weave a compelling story, related with the modesty, grace, and keen eye for a telling anecdote that distinguish his work. His story begins with his childhood experiences as a sickly afterthought, weighed down by the loveless union of his parents. From there he traces the odyssey that led to his search for early postglacial man—and into inspiriting philosophical territory—culminating in his uneasy achievement of world renown. Eiseley crafts an absorbing self-portrait of a man who has thought deeply about his place in society as well as humanity's place in the natural world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;''The Star Thrower'' (1978)
His friend and science fiction author [[Ray Bradbury]] wrote, "The book will be read and cherished in the year 2001. It will go to the Moon and Mars with future generations. Loren Eiseley's work changed my life."&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, Ray.

;''The Lost Notebooks of Loren Eiseley'' (1987) [https://books.google.com/books?id=NfmoHi4-M-cC&amp;output=html Read excerpts online]
Just before his death Eiseley asked his wife to destroy the personal notebooks which he had kept since 1953. However, she compromised by disassembling them so they couldn't be used. Later, after great effort, his good friend Kenneth Heuer managed to reassemble most of his notebooks into readable form. ''The Lost Notebooks of Loren Eiseley'' includes a variety of Eiseley's writings including childhood stories, sketches while he was a vagabond, old family pictures, unpublished poems, portions of unfinished novels, and letters to and from literary admirers like [[W.H. Auden]], [[Howard Nemerov]], [[Lewis Mumford]] and [[Ray Bradbury]].

In a review of the book, author Robert Finch writes, "Like [[Herman Melville|Melville]], Eiseley thought of himself, and by extension all mankind, as 'an orphan, a wood child, a changeling,' a cosmic outcast born into a world that afforded him no true home." He adds that his "distinctive gift as a writer was to take powerfully formative personal influences of family and place and fuse them with his intellectual meditations on universal topics such as evolution, human consciousness and the weight of time. ... he found metaphors that released a powerful view of man's fate in the modern world." As Kenneth Heuer writes, "there are countless examples of Eiseley's empathy with life in all its forms, and particularly with its lost outcasts...the love that transcends the boundaries of species was the highest spiritual expression he knew.&lt;ref name=Notebook&gt;Finch, Robert. ''New York Times'', September 20, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Finch adds, "We are grateful for a life and a sensibility that would be welcome in any age, but never more so than in our increasingly depersonalized world. ... he made a generation of readers 'see the world through his eyes.' In an undated passage, circa 1959, Eiseley wrote, 'Man is alone in the universe...Only in the act of love, in rare and hidden communion with nature, does man escape himself.'" ''The Lost Notebooks'' contains numerous examples of his "creative and sympathetic imagination, even when that creation takes place in the solitude of journals never meant for public eyes."&lt;ref name=Notebook/&gt;

From other reviews: "Eiseley has rightly been called 'the modern [[Thoreau]].'" –''Publishers Weekly;'' "[an] extensive and enlightening glimpses ... into the intellectual and emotional workshop of one of the most original and influential American essayists of this century." –''New York Times Book Review;''  "Eiseley's great genius for the art of the word coupled with a poetic insight into the connection between science and humanism shines through in page after page... This is a book that will be read and quoted and whose pages will grow thin with wear from hands in continued search of new meaning within its words and images." –''Los Angeles Times;''  "it will enhance any dedicated reader's knowledge of this most remarkable literary naturalist... They provide more than a glimpse into Eiseley's mind and imagination." –''The Bloomsbury Review;''   "It is a joy, like finding a lost Rembrandt in the attic, to discover that Eiseley left behind a legacy." –''San Francisco Examiner-Chronicle.''&lt;ref&gt;Book review of ''The Lost Notebooks'' [http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/catalog/productinfo.aspx?id=672121&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 University of Nebraska Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612073946/http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/catalog/productinfo.aspx?id=672121&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 |date=2011-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical significance ==

===Religion ===
Richard Wentz, professor of religious studies, noted that ''The Christian Century'' magazine called attention to a study of Loren Eiseley by saying: "The religious chord did not sound in him, but he vibrated to many of the concerns historically related to religion." Wentz adds, "Although Eiseley may not have considered his writing as an expression of American spiritually, one feels that he was quite mindful of its religious character. As an heir of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] and [[Thoreau]], he is at home among the poets and [[philosopher]]s and among those scientists whose observations also were a form of contemplation of the universe."

But Wentz considered the inherent contradictions in the statements: "We do not really know what to do with religiousness when it expresses itself outside those enclosures which historians and social scientists have carefully labeled religions. What, after all, does it mean to say, "the religious chord does not sound in someone," but that the person vibrates to the concerns historically related to religion? If the person vibrates to such concerns, the chord is religious whether or not it manages to resound in the temples and prayer houses of the devout."&lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

Wentz quotes Eiseley, from ''All the Strange Hours'' and ''The Star Thrower'', to indicate that he was, in fact, a religious thinker:

{{quote|I am treading deeper and deeper into leaves and silence. I see more faces watching, non-human faces. Ironically, I who profess no religion find the whole of my life a religious pilgrimage.

The religious forms of the present leave me unmoved. My eye is round, open, and undomesticated as an owl's in a primeval forest -- a world that for me has never truly departed.

Like the toad in my shirt we were in the hands of God, but we could not feel him; he was beyond us, totally and terribly beyond our limited- senses.

Man is not as other creatures and. . . without the sense of the holy, without compassion, his brain can become a gray stalking horror -- the deviser of [[Belsen]].}}

Wentz encompasses such quotes in his partial conclusion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He was indeed a scientist – a bone hunter, he called himself. [[Archaeologist]], [[anthropologist]] and naturalist, he devoted a great deal of time and reflection to the detective work of scientific observation. However, if we are to take seriously his essays, we cannot ignore the evidence of his constant meditation on matters of ultimate order and meaning.&lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt; Science writer Connie Barlow says Eiseley wrote eloquent books from a perspective that today would be called [[Religious Naturalism]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metanexus.net/blog/ritualizing-big-history  |title=Ritualizing Big History March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Evolution===
Wentz writes, "Loren Eiseley is very much in the tradition of [[Henry David Thoreau]]. He takes the circumstances of whatever "business" he is about as the occasion for new questioning, new searching for some sign, some glimpse into the meaning of the unknown that confronts him at every center of existence." He quotes Eiseley from ''The Star Thrower'', "We are, in actuality, students of that greater order known as nature. It is into nature that man vanishes." &lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

In comparing Eiseley with Thoreau, he discusses clear similarities in their life and philosophies. He notes that Eiseley was, like Thoreau, a 'spiritual wanderer through the deserts of the modern world.' However, notes Wentz, "Thoreau had left the seclusion of [[Walden Pond]] in order to pace the fields of history, sorting out the artifacts that people had dropped along the way." But "it was those 'fossil thoughts' and 'mindprints' that Eiseley himself explored in his wanderings. These explorations gave depth, a tragic dimension and catharsis to what he called the 'one great drama that concerns us most, the supreme mystery, man.'"&lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

Eiseley's writing often includes his belief that mankind does not have enough evidence to determine exactly how humans came to be. In ''The Immense Journey'', he writes, "…many lines of seeming relatives, rather than merely one, lead to man. It is as though we stood at the heart of a maze and no longer remembered how we had come there." According to Wentz, Eiseley realized that there is nothing below a certain depth that can truly be explained, and quotes Eiseley as saying that there is "nothing to explain the necessity of life, nothing to explain the hunger of the elements to become life . . . ."  and that "the human version of evolutionary events [is] perhaps too simplistic for belief." &lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

===Science and progress===
Eiseley talked about the illusions of science in his book, ''The Firmament of Time'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;A scientist writing around the turn of the century remarked that all of the past generations of men have lived and died in a world of illusion. The unconscious irony in his observation consists in the fact that this man assumed the progress of science to have been so great that a clear vision of the world without illusion was, by his own time, possible. It is needless to add that he wrote before [[Einstein]]... at a time when [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]] was just about to be rediscovered, and before the advances in the study of radioactivity...&lt;ref&gt;Templeton, Robert L. ''Is God the Only Reality?'', Templeton Foundation Press (1994), quoted by, pg. 144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wentz noted Eiseley's belief that science may have become misguided in its goals: "Loren Eiseley thought that much of the modern scientific enterprise had removed humanity ever farther from its sense of responsibility to the natural world it had left in order to create an artificial world to satisfy its own insatiable appetites." Interpreting Eiseley's messages, he adds, "It would be well, he tells us, to heed the message of the [[Buddha]], who knew that 'one cannot proceed upon the path of human [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] until one has made interiorly in one's soul a road into the future.' Spaces within stretch as far as those without." &lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

===Purpose for mankind===
"In essay after essay," writes Wentz, "he writes as a [[magus]], a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] master or a [[shaman]] who has seen into the very heart of the universe and shares his healing vision with those who live in a world of feeble sight. We must learn to see again, he tells us; we must rediscover the true center of the self in the otherness of nature."  &lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

==Death and burial==
[[Image:Eiseley-headstone.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Loren Eiseley's headstone in West Laurel Hill Cemetery - "We loved the earth but could not stay"]]
Loren Eiseley died July 9, 1977, of cardiac arrest following surgery at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D00E3DD1F39E334BC4952DFB166838C669EDE |title=Loren Eiseley, Anthropologist, 69; Eloquent Writer on Man and Nature |publisher=Blum, Howard, ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 11, 1977 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in [[West Laurel Hill Cemetery]] in [[Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania]]. Eiseley's wife, Mabel Langdon Eiseley, died July 27, 1986, and is buried next to him, in the Westlawn section of the cemetery, in Lot 366. The inscription on their headstone reads, "We loved the earth but could not stay", which is a line from his poem ''The Little Treasures''.

A library in the [[Lincoln City Libraries]] [[public library]] system is named after Eiseley.

Loren Eiseley was awarded the Distinguished Nebraskan Award and inducted into the [[Nebraska Hall of Fame]]. A bust of his likeness resides in the [[Nebraska State Capitol]].

==Legacy==
In summarizing some of Eiseley's contributions, the editor of ''The Bloomsbury Review'' wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;There can be no question that Loren Eiseley maintains a place of eminence among nature writers. His extended explorations of human life and mind, set against the backdrop of our own and other universes are like those to be found in every book of nature writing currently available... We now routinely expect our nature writers to leap across the chasm between science, natural history, and poetry with grace and ease. Eiseley made the leap at a time when science was science, and literature was, well, literature... His writing delivered science to nonscientists in the lyrical language of earthly metaphor, irony, simile, and narrative, all paced like a good mystery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On October 25, 2007, the Governor of Nebraska, [[Dave Heineman]], officially declared that year "The Centennial Year of Loren Eiseley."  In a written proclamation, he encouraged all Nebraskans

&lt;blockquote&gt;to read Loren Eisely's writings and to appreciate in those writings the richness and beauty of his language, his ability to depict the long, slow passage of time and the meaning of the past in the present, his portrayal of the relationships among all living things and his concern for the future.&lt;ref name=proclamation&gt;Heineman, Dave, Governor of Nebraska.

'''Magnetic survey''' is one of a number of methods used in [[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|archaeological geophysics]]. Magnetic surveys record spatial variation in the Earth's magnetic field. In [[archaeology]], magnetic surveys are used to detect and map archaeological [[Artefact (archaeology)|artefacts]] and [[Feature (archaeology)|features]]. Magnetic surveys are used in both terrestrial and [[marine archaeology]].

== Overview ==

[[Magnetometer]]s used in geophysical survey may use a single sensor to measure the total magnetic field strength, or may use two (sometimes more) spatially separated sensors to measure the gradient of the magnetic field (the difference between the sensors). In most archaeological applications the latter (gradiometer) configuration is preferred because it provides better resolution of small, near-surface phenomena. Magnetometers may also use a variety of different sensor types. Proton precession magnetometers have largely been superseded by faster and more sensitive fluxgate and cesium instruments.

Every kind of material has unique magnetic properties, even those that we do not think of as being "magnetic". Different materials below the ground can cause local disturbances in the Earth’s magnetic field that are detectable with sensitive magnetometers. The chief limitation of magnetometer survey is that subtle features of interest may be obscured by highly magnetic geologic or modern materials.

== Terrestrial magnetic surveys ==

In terrestrial archaeology, magnetic surveys are typically used for detailed mapping of archaeological features on known archaeological sites. More exceptionally, magnetometers are used for low-resolution exploratory surveys.

Several types of magnetometer are used in terrestrial archaeology. Early surveys, beginning in the 1950s, were conducted with [[Magnetometers#Proton_precession_magnetometer|proton precession magnetometers]]. Data collection with proton precession instruments was slow, making high sample density surveys impracticable. Data were manually recorded and plotted. The subsequent introduction of [[Magnetometers#Fluxgate_magnetometer|Fluxgate]] and [[Magnetometers#Cesium_vapor_magnetometer|cesium vapor]] magnetometers improved sensitivity, and greatly increased sampling speed, making high resolution surveys of large areas practical. Equally important was the development of computers to handle, process, and display large datasets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Clark | first=Anthony J. | year=1996 | title=Seeing Beneath the Soil. Prospecting Methods in Archaeology | publisher=B.T. Batsford Ltd. | location=London, United Kingdom }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetometers react very strongly to iron and steel, brick, burned soil, and many types of rock, and archaeological features composed of these materials are very detectable. Where these highly magnetic materials do not occur, it is often possible to detect very subtle anomalies caused by disturbed soils or decayed organic materials. Many types of sites and features have been successfully mapped with magnetometers, ranging from very ephemeral prehistoric campsites to large urban centers.

Magnetic survey helped to proved that the survey area is potential for more detail studies and the magnetic survey has a huge potential for scientific excavation.

== Marine Magnetic Surveys ==

Magnetic surveys are extremely useful in the excavation and exploration of underwater archaeological sites.  The apparatus used on the water slightly differs from that on land.  Marine [[magnetometers]] come in two types: Surface towed and near-bottom.  Both are towed a sufficient distance (about two ship lengths) away from the ship to allow them to collect data without it being polluted by the ship's magnetic properties.  Surface towed magnetometers allow for a wider range of detection at the price of precision accuracy that is afforded by the near-bottom magnetometers.&lt;ref name="woods"&gt;"Marine Magnetometer." Ocean Instruments. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=8415&amp;tid=3622&amp;cid=14847&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common type of magnetometer used for marine survey is the [[fluxgate magnetometer]].  Fluxgate magnetometers utilize two ferromagnetic cores each wound with a primary coil (in opposite directions) and an outer secondary coil attached to an amp meter.  When an alternating current (AC) is passed through the primary coils, it creates two opposing magnetic fields that vary in intensity based on the outside magnetic fields.&lt;ref name="Boyd"&gt;Boyd, Thomas M. "Measuring the Earth's Magnetic Field." Introduction to Geophysical Exploration. 30 June 1999. University of Melbourne. 9 May 2009 http://www.earthsci.unimelb.edu.au/ES304/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  By floating them parallel to the seafloor, they can measure the changes in magnetic fields over the seabed.

Another common type is the newer [[proton precession magnetometer]].  This utilizes a container full of hydrogen rich liquids (commonly [[kerosene]] or [[methanol]]) that, when agitated by a direct current (DC) or Radio Frequency (RF), cause the electrons to become energized and transfer that energy to the protons due to the [[Overhauser Effect]] basically turning them into dipole magnets.  When the stimulus is removed, the protons precess at a rate that can be interpreted to determine the magnetic forces of the area.&lt;ref name="Boyd"/&gt;

In maritime archaeology, these are often used to map the geology of wreck sites and determine the composition of magnetic materials found on the seafloor.  An Overhauser magnetometer (PPM) was used in 2001 to map Sebastos (the harbor of [[Caesarea Maritima]]) and helped to identify components of the [[Roman concrete]].&lt;ref name="boyce"&gt;Boyce, Joseph I., Eduard G. Reinhardt, Avner Raban, and Matthew R. Pozza. "Marine Magnetic Survey of a Submerged Roman Harbour, Caesarea Maritima, Israel."

==Backstory==
The Emirates were among the five Arab allies that joined the United States in the [[2014 military intervention against ISIS in Syria|airstrikes in Syria]] in 2014. So to beat back ISIS forces, and were first to participate.&lt;ref name=NBC/&gt; In an interview with MSNBC,&lt;ref name=ex&gt;[http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/monde/proche-moyen-orient/mariam-al-mansouri-la-femme-pilote-des-emirats-qui-dirige-les-frappes-en-syrie_1579631.html Mariam al-Mansouri, la femme pilote des Emirats qui dirige les frappes en Syrie], Clément Daniez, 26/09/2014, [[L'Express (France)
|L'express]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yousef Al Otaiba]], Emirati ambassador to the United States, recounted that when U.S. Air Force tanker pilots radioed in to speak with the UAE mission during [[air refueling]] and heard al-Mansouri's voice, they were initially surprised and silent for a short time.&lt;ref name=NBC/&gt;

==Family, education, and work==
Al-Mansouri is one of 8 children.&lt;ref Name=NatEmiratiwoman/&gt; Her family is related to [[Sultan bin Saeed Al Mansoori]], an engineer and politician in the UAE.&lt;ref name=dm&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2771731/Family-UAE-s-female-fighter-pilot-spearheaded-attacks-against-ISIS-publicly-disown-taking-brutal-international-aggression-against-Syria.html Arab woman pilot who is poster girl for Gulf states' blitz on ISIS is 'disowned by her family' for bombing 'Sunni heroes of Iraq and the Levant'] Mariam Al Mansouri's F-16 bombing raids were celebrated in the [[Western world|West]], but a statement purporting to be from her UAE family has 'disowned' her, that it attacks her for 'taking part in the brutal aggression against Syria'], Ted Thornhill and Chris Spargo for MailOnline, 27/9/2014&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''Deraa Al Watan'' magazine, she said that her family supported her career goals, but she had to overcome gender stereotypes along the way. It helped that she had finished high school with excellent marks.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/meet-female-pilot-led-airstrike-isis/story?id=25751373 Meet the Female Pilot Who Led Airstrike on ISIS] Sep 25, 2014, SUSANNA KIM Good Morning America, abc news&lt;/ref&gt; She earned an undergraduate degree in [[English literature]] from [[United Arab Emirates University]].&lt;ref Name=NatEmiratiwoman/&gt;

Al-Mansouri served in the army before starting in flight training. She attended the Khalifa bin-Zayed Air College of the [[United Arab Emirates Air Force]] for pilots, graduating in 2007.&lt;ref name=nat&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/uaes-female-fighter-pilot-leads-airstrikes-against-isil UAE’s female fighter pilot leads airstrikes against ISIL] UAE The National, September 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; She received the Mohammed bin Rashid Pride of the Emirates medal&lt;ref Name=NatEmiratiwoman/&gt; for excellence in her field.&lt;ref Name=NBC/&gt;

Before the Syrian airstrikes, al-Mansouri was profiled in ''The National'', an Abu Dhabi newspaper, in June 2014. In July 2014, [[CNN]] interviewed her about her career in the UAE Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/unitedarabemirates/11121115/First-woman-fighter-jet-pilot-from-United-Arab-Emirates-says-she-has-to-prove-herself-in-front-of-the-men.html#ooid=k2eXRvcDr4nQf-mJmMOyooqdNpP5dVEE CNN Interview with Masouri July 2014, on Telegraph website]&lt;/ref&gt; She said she aspired to become a pilot since high school, but had to wait until women were permitted.&lt;ref Name=NatEmiratiwoman/&gt; In the meantime, she earned her degree and worked for the army general staff in other capacities.&lt;ref Name=NatEmiratiwoman/&gt;

==2014 airstrikes and media role==
Al Otaiba called her a "fully qualified, highly trained, combat-ready pilot and wing leader".&lt;ref Name=NBC/&gt; He regards al-Mansouri as a role model for women in Islamic and Arab states.&lt;ref Name=NBC/&gt; Al Otaiba said, "I think it's important for us moderate Arabs, moderate Muslims, to step up and say: 'this is a threat against us'".&lt;ref name=nat/&gt;

''[[Spiegel Online]]'' and ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' referred to al-Mansouri's reception in [[social media]] where she had been dubbed ''"[[Liberty (goddess)|Lady Liberty]]"'' and ''"nightmare of the ISIS fighters"''.&lt;ref name=faz&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/kampf-gegen-is-miliz-lady-liberty-fliegt-luftangriffe-auf-dschihadisten-13175254.html Kampf gegen IS-Miliz „Lady Liberty“ fliegt Luftangriffe auf Dschihadisten], Christoph Sydow FAZ 26/9/2014&lt;/ref&gt; ''Spiegel'' used the title ''"Operation Wüstenmaid"'' (Operation ''Desert Maiden''). The German news source started a sort of PR campaign. The [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] used her example and the involvement of Saudi prince Chalid bin-Salman, pilot of an IDS [[Panavia Tornado]], against extremism.&lt;ref name=spon&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/is-islamischer-staat-pilotin-und-prinz-bombardieren-syrien-und-irak-a-993927.html Kampf gegen IS als PR-Offensive: Golfstaaten starten Operation Wüstenmaid], Spiegel Von Christoph Sydow 26.09.2014&lt;/ref&gt; According to Palestinian sources, al-Mansouri had been disowned by her family; a claim not confirmed independently.&lt;ref name=dm/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3507">'''Matthew 1:12''' is the twelfth verse of the first chapter of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in the [[New Testament]].  The verse is part of the section where the [[genealogy]] of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], the betrothed of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], the mother of [[Jesus Christ]], is listed.

In the [[King James Version]] of the Bible the text reads:
:And after they were brought to [[Babylon]], 
:[[Jeconiah|Jechonias]] begat [[Shealtiel|Salathiel]]; 
:and Salathiel begat [[Zerubbabel|Zorobabel]];

The [[World English Bible]] translates the passage as:
:After the exile to Babylon, 
:Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel. 
:Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel.

For a collection of other versions see [http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=1:12&amp;src=! BibRef Matthew 1:12]

==Analysis==
[[Jeconiah]] was a [[Kings of Judah|King of Judah]], the last of these kings to be included among Joseph's ancestors.  He was captured and brought to [[Babylon]] along with many of his subjects, beginning the [[Babylonian captivity]].  His son [[Shealtiel]] was born in Babylon, as was Shealtiel's son [[Zerubbabel]].  It was Zerubbabel who led the [[Jew]]s out of exile in Babylon and he plays a prominent role in the [[Book of Ezra]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Zerubbabel and Shealtiel are also listed in the genealogy of [[Luke 3:27]]. However, in Luke, Shealtiel is not listed as the son of Jechoniah but rather of Neri.  A number of explanations have been advanced to explain this.  [[Robert H. Gundry]] believes that Luke gives the actual physical genealogy while Matthew is presenting the ceremonial one.  Thus Neri was Shealtiel's natural father, but it was from Jeconiah which came the leadership of the Jewish people.  This may link in with the prophecy of [[Jeremiah 36:30]], which states that Jehoiakim's children would never again sit on the throne of [[David]] because of his sins. By having Shealtiel be the biological son of Neri, and only the adopted son of Jechoniah, this prohibition is avoided.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert H. Gundry|Gundry, Robert H.]] ''Matthew a Commentary on his Literary and Theological Art.'' Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is further complicated as [[1 Chronicles 3:19]] states that the father of Zerubbabel was Pedaiah, a brother of Shealtiel.  Zerubbabel, which means "born in Babylon" was a common name and it is entirely possible that Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel had a cousin also named Zerubbabel.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Gundry notes that the opening line "after the exile to Babylon" clearly does not refer to this verse alone.  Jeconiah and Shealtiel were in no way after the exile.  Rather, the first line is an introduction to this last third of the biography that covers the period from the captivity to the birth of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert H. Gundry|Gundry, Robert H.]] ''Matthew a Commentary on his Literary and Theological Art.'' Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1722">The '''Meiningen Ensemble''', also known as the [[Meiningen]] Company, was the [[Noble court|court]] theatre of the [[Germany|German]] [[Ernestine duchies|state]] of [[Saxe-Meiningen]], led by [[Georg II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen]]. Its principal director was [[Ludwig Chronegk]]. The Ensemble was a great influence on [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]], [[André Antoine (actor)|Antoine]], and [[Constantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]].&lt;ref name=Innes10/&gt;

The Duke admired [[Charles Kean]]'s attempts to stage [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays in a manner that was historically accurate for the place and period in which each drama was set. The Ensemble that he created, which toured Germany and Europe in 1874–1890, became famous across Europe for its detailed, archeologically authentic reproductions of locations and its realistic, fully individuated crowd scenes.&lt;ref name=Innes10/&gt; Its productions offered a model of an [[Gesamtkunstwerk|integrated, unified]] theatrical [[aesthetic]] and a demonstration of the potential of a tightly controlled, [[Theatre director|director]]-focused mode of theatre-making.

'''Mindre teatern''' (''The Smaller Theatre''), '''Nya teatern''' (''The New Theatre''), '''Lindeberska teatern''' (''The Lindeberg Theatre''), was a Swedish theatre at [[Kungsgatan, Stockholm|Kungsgatan]] in [[Stockholm]], active 1842–1863. The building was used as localitites for the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] in 1863–1908.  

== History ==
The theatre was founded by [[Anders Lindeberg]] in 1842 after the theatre monopoly of the Royal Dramatic theatre was abolished. It was called Mindre teatern (The Smaller Theatre), as the old Royal Dramatic theatre was called "The Big Theatre", Nya teatern (The New Theatre), and also Lindeberska teatern (The Lindeberg Theatre), after its founder. 

It became a popular theatre, which rivaled the royal Theatre. In 1863, the theatre was sold to the Royal Theatre and dissolved. The building itself became the new house for the Royal Dramatic Theatre, who also employed many of the actors, and continued as such for 45 years. It was the fourth building to serve as localities for the royal theatre. When the royal opera and the royal theatre shared building, the Royal Dramatic Theatre was often called "The Small stage", while the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] was called "The Big stage", and this continued after they were separated.    

Eventually, the building was deemed inadequate, and when the new building for the royal theatre was finished in 1908, it was demolished.

Others have March 20, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; – April 20, 1959), had a [[Master of Science]] Degree in astronomy and, though employed for most of his life as an automobile-parts salesman and a photographer, is probably best remembered for his writings on [[UFO|UFOs]].

==Early life==
Born near [[Rockville, Indiana]], Jessup grew up with an interest in [[astronomy]]. He earned a [[Bachelor's degree#BA.2C AB.2C BS.2C BSc.2C SB.2C ScB|bachelor of science]] degree in astronomy from [[The University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] in 1925 and, while working at the Lamont-Hussey Observatory, received a [[Master of Science#MA.2C MS.2C MSc.2C MSE.2C AM.2C SM|master of science]] degree in 1926. Though he began work on his [[doctorate]] in [[astrophysics]], he ended his dissertaton work in 1931 and never earned the higher degree.  Nevertheless, he was sometimes referred to as "Dr. Jessup."  He apparently dropped his career and studies in astronomy and worked for the rest of his life in a variety of jobs unrelated to science, although he is sometimes erroneously described as having been an instructor in astronomy and mathematics at the University of Michigan and [[Drake University]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris K. Jessup, annotated by three unknown individuals, ''The Case for the UFO'', Varo Edition, (Garland, TX: Varo Corporation, 1957); available at [http://www.cassiopaea.org/cass/Varo-Jessup.PdF].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Jessup has been referred to in ufological circles as "probably the most original [[extraterrestrial hypothesis]]er of the 1950s", and it has been said of him that he was "educated in [[astronomy]] and [[archeology]] and had working experience in both."&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Clark, ''The UFO Encyclopedia'', 2nd Edition, (Detroit: Omnigraphics, 1988), p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;  Actual evidence of an educational background in archaeology or archaeological field work is absent from Jessup's resume, but [[Jerome Clark]]&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Jerome, ''The UFO encyclopedia: the phenomenon from the beginning, volume 2, L-Z, Detroit: Omnigraphics, 1998, {{ISBN|0780800974}}''&lt;/ref&gt; reports that Jessup took part in archeological expeditions to the [[Yucatan]] and [[Peru]] in the 1920s.  Jessup documented an expedition to [[Cuzco]] he took part in during 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Jessup, M.K., "Inca Masonry at Cuszco", ''American Anthropologist'', 35, (1934), pp. 239-241, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/aa.1934.36.2.02a00100/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

Jessup achieved some notoriety with his 1955 book ''The Case for the UFO'', in which he argued that [[unidentified flying object]]s (UFOs) represented a mysterious subject worthy of further study. Jessup speculated that UFOs were "exploratory craft of "solid" and "nebulous" character."&lt;ref&gt;David Richie, ''UFO: The Definitive Guide to Unidentified Flying Objects and Related Phenomena'', (New York: Facts on File, 1994), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jessup also "linked ancient monuments with prehistoric superscience,"&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; years before similar claims were made by [[Erich von Däniken]] in ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'' and other books.

Jessup wrote three further flying-saucer books, ''UFOs and the Bible'', ''The UFO Annual'' (both 1956), and ''The Expanding Case for the UFO'' (1957). The latter suggested that [[transient lunar phenomenon]] were somehow related to UFOs in the earth's skies. Jessup's main flying-saucer scenario came to resemble that of the [[Richard Sharpe Shaver|Shaver Hoax]] perpetrated by the science-fiction magazine editor [[Raymond A. Palmer]]&amp;mdash;namely, that "good" and "bad" groups of space aliens were/are meddling with terrestrial affairs.  Like most of the writers on flying saucers and the so-called [[contactees]] that emerged during the 1950s, Jessup displayed familiarity with the alternative [[mythology]] of human prehistory developed by [[Helena P. Blavatsky]]'s cult of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], which included the mythical lost continents of [[Atlantis]], [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]], and [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]].

==Death==
Jessup attempted to make a living writing on the subject of UFOs, but his follow-up books did not sell well and his publisher rejected several other manuscripts. In 1958 his wife left him, and his friends described him as being somewhat unstable when he traveled to [[New York City]]. After returning to [[Florida]], he was involved in a serious car accident and was slow to recover, apparently increasing his despondency. On April 19, 1959, Jessup contacted Dr. [[Manson Valentine]] and arranged to meet with him the next day, claiming to have made a breakthrough regarding an event known as the [[Philadelphia Experiment]]. However, on April 20, 1959, Jessup was found dead in [[Miami-Dade County|Dade County, Florida]], with a hose between the exhaust pipe and a rear window of the vehicle, filling the car with toxic exhaust fumes. The death was ruled a [[suicide]]. Some people believed that "The circumstances of Jessup's apparent suicide remain mysterious"&lt;ref&gt;Richie, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] theorists contended that it was connected to his knowledge of the "Philadelphia Experiment".&lt;ref&gt;William L. Moore with [[Charles Berlitz]], ''The Philadelphia Experiment: Project Invisibility'', (New York: Fawcett Crest, 1979), chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although some friends claimed that he possibly had been driven to suicide by the "Allende Case,"&lt;ref&gt;Moore, pp. 79-81.&lt;/ref&gt; other friends said that an extremely depressed Jessup had been discussing suicide with his friends for several months before committing suicide. &lt;ref&gt;Ronald D. Story, ''The Encyclopedia of UFOs'', (Garden City, NY: Doubleday/Dolphin, 1980), p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kooli Mudiyett കൂളി മുടിയേറ്റ്.jpg|thumb|250px|right|kooli - a character who helps Kali appear as a comedian]]
'''Mudiyett''' or Mudiyettu is a traditional ritual theatre and folk dance drama from [[Kerala]] that enacts the mythological tale of a battle between the goddess [[Kali]] and the demon [[Darika]].  The ritual is a part of the [[bhagavathi]] or [[bhadrakali]] cult. The dance is performed in bhadrakali temples, the temples of the [[Mother Goddess]], between February and May after the harvesting season.
In 2010 Mudiyettu was inscribed in the [[UNESCO]]’s [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]], becoming the second art form from Kerala after [[Koodiyattam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UNESCO recognition a boost to Mudiyettu&amp;#124;http://www.hindu.com/2010/11/26/stories/2010112651080200.htm|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=November 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Kali - Darika myth ==
Darika was a demon who received a boon from [[Brahma]] which granted that he would never be defeated by any man living in any of the [[Hindu mythology|fourteen worlds of Hindu mythology]]. This made Darika immensely powerful and arrogant. Armed with this boon, Darika went on to conquer the world defeating even [[Indra]], the king of the gods. As his atrocities became intolerable, the sage [[Narada]] requested [[Shiva]] to contain Darika. Shiva agreed, circumventing Brahma's boon by declaring that Darika would be killed by the goddess Kali, she being a woman and one not born among the humans.

== Features of Mudiyett ==
Mudiyett is a village ritual performed by members of the [[Marar]] and Kuruppu communities in [[Thrissur]], [[Ernakulam]], [[Kottayam]] and [[Idukki]] districts of Kerala. However, the entire community contributes to and participates in it.  Mudiyettu is performed annually in ‘Bhagavati Kavus’, the temples of the goddess, in different villages along the rivers [[Chalakkudy Puzha]], [[Periyar (river)|Periyar]] and [[Moovattupuzha]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00345&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no rehearsal or preparation involved in playing Kali. The performance is a natural progression from Lord Shiva, Narada, demons Danavan and Darikan to Kali. A complete Mudiyettu performance requires a total of 16 persons— including percussionists, Kalamezhuthu artists, vocalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Girls too must inherit the tradition: Mudiyettu exponent&amp;#124;http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/article906982.ece|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=November 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also evident regional differences in the attire and performance styles of Mudiyettu. Thus, in the Koratty style, Kali  exhibits a bare torso, covered only by a breast-shaped plank while in the Keezhillam and the Pazhoor styles, she wears a full upper body dress. Similarly, in the Koratty style, Darika's ''mudi'' resembles the [[Kathakali]] crown and his face paint the ''Kathi Veshas'' of Kathakali. This points to how the two forms have become interlinked even though Mudiyettu predates Kathakali, with [[Epigraphy|epigraphists]] tracing its evolution as an art to even the 9th or 10th century AD.&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;{{cite news |title=UNESCO recognition for an age-old art &amp;#124;http://www.hindu.com/2010/11/17/stories/2010111753170500.htm|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=November 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The role of the community ==
Mudiyettu is a communal undertaking in which each caste of the village plays a specific role. The bamboo artefacts and leather hides for drums are provided by the [[Parayan]] caste while the [[Thandan]] caste brings the [[areca nut]] fronds that are required for the masks and headgears. The [[Ganaka]]n community paints the masks while the Kuruvan community keeps the country torches burning. It is the Veluthedan (Patiyan) caste that washes the clothes used for making the deity’'s dress while the Maran caste readies the torches and keeps them supplied with oil. 

Thus each caste in the village contributes to the festival according to its traditional caste role. Mutual cooperation and collective participation of each caste in the ritual instills and strengthens common identity and mutual bonding in the community.&lt;ref name="NominationFile"&gt;Nomination File No. 00345  For Inscription on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2010. UNESCO, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transmitting and conserving Mudiyett ==
Being a community based art form it is the community that has traditionally encouraged and trained the next generation to preserve the art form. There is no school or institution to give training in this art form and its survival depends almost exclusively on direct transmission through the Guru-Shishya Parampara.&lt;ref name="NominationFile" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6125">The '''National Public Housing Museum''' is a historical institution at 1322 W Taylor St. in [[Chicago]], Illinois set to open by the end of 2018.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The museum is located in the last remaining building of the [[Jane Addams]] Homes of [[ABLA Homes]], and will feature an [[oral history]] archive, public programming, and an entrepreneurship hub. [[Exhibition]]s will include restored apartment of three families who lived in the Jane Addams homes. The building that the museum is contained within opened in 1938 as the first federal government [[Public housing|housing project]] in Chicago. It housed thousands of families over six decades and has been vacant since 2002 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nphm.org/our-vision/place/|title=Place|website=National Public Housing Museum|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The movement for conservation of a public housing building began in the 1990s with the announcement of the Plan for Transformation, a [[Chicago Housing Authority]] initiative to demolish 17,000 units of [[public housing]] and replace them with mixed-income housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecha.org/about/plan-for-transformation/|title=Plan for Transformation|last=|first=|date=|website=The Chicago Housing Authority|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents, led by Deverra Beverly, a former commissioner for the Chicago Housing Authority, began and led the movement for the creation of a memorialization of their presence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/national-public-housing-museum-abla-jane-addams-homes/Content?oid=27428793|title=The National Public Housing Museum’s long journey home|last=Dukmasova|first=Maya|work=Chicago Reader|access-date=2017-10-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beverly and other public housing residents approached Sunny Fischer, a philanthropy professional and former public housing resident herself, with their proposal for a museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-07-08/site/ct-tribu-remarkable-sunny-fischer-20120708_1_national-public-housing-museum-jane-addams-homes-tenement-museum|title=Remarkable Woman: Sunny Fischer|last=|first=|date=|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2017-10-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the way, CHA residents were joined by "civic leaders, preservationists, historians, and cultural experts who also wanted to create a new architectural landmark to recognize an important historic site."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Lisa Yun|date=2017-08-11|title=The Stories We Collect: Promoting Housing as a Human Right at the National Public Housing Museum|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/666786|journal=Forum Journal|volume=31|issue=3|pages=9–20|issn=2325-7296}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group came together to preserve and transform the current site of the museum, originally designed by a team of architects led by [[John Holabird]]. As the project moved forward, the museum maintained a commitment to uplifting the voices and narratives of public housing residents, and includes public housing residents as about a third of its board.

== Exhibits, collections and programming == 
The mission of the museum is to “promote, interpret, and propel housing as a human right” . This mission manifests in the museums oral history-focused approach to storytelling and community development and programming.  The museum’s planned exhibitions and collections include an archive of [[Oral history|oral histories]] of public housing residents, three restored apartments of three diverse (One [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jewish]], one [[Italian Americans|Italian-American]], and one [[African Americans|African American]]) families that lived in the public housing based on the oral histories of Inez Medor, members of the Rizzi family, and Marshall Hatch,  and a community space for discussion and interpretation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Prior to opening, the museum served largely as a “museum in the streets” and hosted events like neighborhood storytelling and poetry readings, beautification projects at the site of the museum, and panels across the country. Most recently, National Public Housing Museum has partnered with Oral History Summer School to help train a group of activists, organizers, students, and artists in how to collect and utilize the medium of oral history, while additionally expanding the museum’s [[Archive|archival]] collection of oral histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nphm.org/programs/exhibits/|title=Exhibits|website=National Public Housing Museum|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum has not yet determined if it will devote a significant amount of resources to growing and maintaining a collection. As a member of the International Coalition of Sites of Conscience, the museum holds a responsibility to not only historicize its focus but also connect the focus to current struggles and initiatives.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sitesofconscience.org/en/membership/national-public-housing-museum/|title=National Public Housing Museum (USA)|last=|first=|date=|website=Sites of Conscience|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum used the examples of the [[Apartheid Museum]], [[District Six Museum]], the [[Lower East Side Tenement Museum|Tenement Museum]] and the [[Hull House|Jane Addams Hull-House Museum]] as inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/museums/ct-chicago-public-housing-museum-ae-0508-20160505-column.html|title=Chicago National Public Housing Museum aims for the conscience|last=Johnson|first=Steve|date=6 May 2016|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2017-10-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Serbia''' ({{lang-uk|Нова Сербія|Nova Serbija}}; {{lang-ru|Новая Сербия}}; {{lang-sr|Нова Србија}} / {{lang|sr-latn|Nova Srbija}}; archaic Serbian name: Нова Сербія or Ново-Сербія; {{lang-ro|Noua Serbie}}) was a military frontier of [[Imperial Russia]] from 1752 to 1764 subordinated directly to the [[Governing Senate|Senat]] and Military Collegium.

It was mostly located in the territory of present-day [[Kirovohrad Oblast]] of [[Ukraine]], although some of its parts were located in the territory of present-day [[Cherkasy Oblast]], [[Poltava Oblast]] and [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]]. The administrative centre of New Serbia was Novomirgorod (literally "New [[Mirgorod]]"), which is now [[Novomyrhorod]], Ukraine.

==History==
The region was named after [[Serbs]], who migrated in 1752 to  the [[Russian Empire]] from the [[Military Frontier]] of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. Russian authorities gave these Serbian settlers a land, which thus acquired its name, New Serbia soon after the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. As the Panonian Frontier, New Serbia was also organized into military province located on the Russian-[[Poland|Polish]] border and on the land of Buhogard palanka, [[Zaporizhian Sich]]. The purpose of the polity was a protection of southern borders of the Russian empire as well as participation in Russian military operations near that region. Commandant of New Serbia was [[Jovan Horvat]] who vouched for his subordinates the Austrian [[Grenz infantry]].

==Demographics==
Before the formation of New Serbia, its territory was mostly populated by [[Ukrainians]] and included 3,710 houses of settlers from the [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetmanate]], [[Slobozhanshchina]] and [[Zaporizhia]], 643 houses of native inhabitants and 195 houses of Ukrainian settlers from [[Poland]] and [[Moldavia]]. When New Serbia was formed, the [[Russian senate]] ordered that all these settlers, except native inhabitants, must return to the places where they had previously lived.

After the formation of New Serbia, its initial new settlers were [[Serbs]], but also many [[Moldavia]]ns and other [[Romanians]] (''[[:ro:Mocani|Mocani]]'' from [[Transylvania]]), [[Ukrainians]], [[Bulgarians]] and others settled in the area.

Some of the original Ukrainian settlers who left the territory of New Serbia settled in the southern regions of modern-day [[Ukraine]]. In 1745, before the formation of New Serbia, its territory was populated by 9,660 inhabitants, while in 1754, the number of inhabitants was 3,989.

Because of the large number of Moldavian settlers, the largest ethnic group in the province in 1757 were not Serbs, but Moldavians.&lt;ref&gt;Olga M. Posunjko, Istorija Nove Srbije i Slavenosrbije, Novi Sad, 2002, page 36.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1757, population of New Serbia numbered 5,482 inhabitants, including:&lt;ref&gt;Olga M. Posunjko, Istorija Nove Srbije i Slavenosrbije, Novi Sad, 2002, page 36.&lt;/ref&gt;
*75.33% [[Moldavia]]ns
*11.56% [[Serbs]]
*13.11% others

In their new home, Serbs established new places, and consequently gave them same names such as the names of the places in their old home in the [[Pannonian Plain]] (in modern-day [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]] and [[Hungary]]). Serbs also changed names of some older settlements, giving them [[Serbian language|Serb]] names. Of the 41 settlements that existed in New Serbia, 26 were founded before arrival of the Serbs.

'''Norbert Finzsch''' (born 1951 in Cologne, Germany) as '''Norbert Rollewitz''' is a [[Germans|German]] [[historian]].

==Education and career==
Norbert Finzsch studied [[German literature]] and [[United States]][[history]] at the [[University of Cologne]], where he passed the state exam in both majors in 1977. In 1980 he received his [[PhD]] in history at Cologne. The title of the dissertation was ''The Gold miners of California: Conditions of Work, Standards of Living, and Political System in the Middle of the Nineteenth Century''. It was a [[cliometric]] study. From 1981 to 1988 Finzsch taught American History as an assistant professor at the University of Cologne. In 1983/1984 he was a fellow of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] at the [[University of California]] at Berkeley. In 1988 Finzsch passed his Habilitation (qualification for a professorship) and award of the Venia Legendi (right to teach) with a study of the [[social history]] of the [[Rhineland]] during the late 18th and early 19th century. In 1990 Finzsch was appointed Deputy Director of the [[German Historical Institute]] in Washington, D.C. In 1992 he received the chair of Modern History at the [[University of Hamburg]] as the successor of [[Günter Moltmann]]. He went to the [[University of Cologne]] in 2001 as Professor for North-American History. His research interests encompass the social history of the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries, the history of gender and sexuality and, since 2001, Australian history. From 2005 to 2007 Finzsch served as Vice President of the University of Cologne. Between 1996 and 2000 Finzsch received several fellowships at the University of California in Berkeley, both at the ''Center for German and European Studies'' and the ''Center for International Government Studies''. 2000/2001 he served as a visiting Professor at the [[Université Michel Montaigne]] at Bordeaux, 2003 as Visiting Scholar at the ''Humanities Research Centre'' at the [[Australian National University]] in [[Canberra]], Australia. 2012/13 Finzsch was appointed Distinguished Visiting Scholar at Berkeley. 2014/2015 he was received a fellowship at the International Research Center ''re:work'' at the [[Humboldt University]] in Berlin. In 2016 Finzsch retired.

==Research==
Finzsch began his career as a quantifying social historian of the US and Germany. Influenced by the [[linguistic turn]] and [[post-structuralist theory]], he became a cultural historian, focusing on [[African American history]], the history of penitentiaries and the history of [[sexualities]]. At the end of the 1990s, Finzsch broadened his interests by researching the history of [[genocides]] and [[female genital mutilation]] in Western Europe between 1600 and 1950.

'''Pavel Bergmann''' (14 February 1930, in Prague – 17 April 2005, in Prague) was a Czech historian, philosopher, a signatory of the [[Charter 77]] manifesto, and a founding member of the [[Civic Forum]].

==Early life==
'''Pavel Bergmann''' was born in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]] on 14 February 1930 to Jindřich Bergmann and Karolina Steinova. His father's family belonged to the Jewish-German cultural circle. His mother's belonged to Czech cultural circle. After his father died when he was two years old, his grandfather brought him up.

==World War II==
After the Munich crisis in 1938, the prevailing circumstances prevented his mother from emigrating. She was on a special [[Gestapo]] list because she had supported German and Austrian refugees in [[Czechoslovakia]] who were fleeing the [[Nazis]]. She was deported to [[Ghetto Terezin]] and died there in the spring of 1943. Later he was deported to the Ghetto in October 1942 and was there till the spring of 1944. In May 1944 Bergmann was deported to [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]], where he was until the start of the evacuation of this concentration camp in January 1945. Subsequently he was transported to the [[Mauthausen concentration camp]] in Austria. The American army freed the camp in May 1945.

==Education==
Bergmann returned to [[Prague]] in the spring of 1945. Most of the members of his family had been murdered by the Nazis so he lived with his grandmother in Northwestern Bohemia. He finished high school in [[Teplice]]. Bergmann was interested in history and philosophy and was fortunate to start his studies while some of the leading scholars still worked at [[Charles University in Prague]]. He has been a member of the Czech Historical Club since 1947 and was able to attend lectures by Professors [[Jindřich Chalupecký]], [[František Roubík]], [[František Kutnar]] and [[Jan Patočka]].

In the fall of 1947 he entered the [[Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party]] and did not side with those members of the party who joined the Communists in June 1948. In 1950, when another wave of persecutions was coming, he was told by some Communist friends that further purges were imminent. He decided to leave [[Prague]]. He had reasons to be wary because he had known a number of prominent people who were persecuted by the Communist regime, for instance [[Arthur London]] who was sentenced to life imprisonment in the well-known trial of [[Rudolf Slánský]]. He did not interrupt his studies but at the same time he taught small children to read, write and do arithmetic at the elementary level in a small village.

At university he was interested mainly in history but he also studied philosophy, [[sociology]] and [[psychology]]. Since the beginning of liberalization in the Eastern Block in 1956, he had tried to enter public life as a member of the organization which united victims and veterans of World War II. At the time, [[Antonín Novotný]], a former mauthausen prisoner, whom he knew from the concentration camp was the president of Czechoslovakia. It was the fact that helped Bergmann convince him to demand a plaque in memory of the German Social Democrats and Communists who were executed because of their activities as resistance fighters.

==Career==
Pavel Bergmann worked as a scholar at the Philosophical Faculty of Charles University in Prague. In 1964 he was a witness at the so-called Great trial of the leading SS men from the Auschwitz concentration camp. The protocol of this trial was published in English, and the introduction was written by [[Hannah Arendt]]. [[Peter Weiss]], a famous German playwright, used this trial as the basis for his play about the essence of totalitarian crimes against humanity and the role of human beings in such conditions.

In the second half of the 1960s he was able to pursue the studies which were in his interest, that is, the study of totalitarian regimes, especially [[Nazism]]. He was also interested in the problems of the Communist totalitarian system. Since that he had been helping in the reconciliation of the Czech and German nations. He continued his endeavours in this direction even after the restoration of [[Stalinism]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] after 1968, the year of the [[Prague Spring]] and its suppression.

In 1968 he took part in the attempt to reform the Czechoslovak political system and was among those who tried to renew the [[Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party]]. He worked as an advisor on Germany for [[Josef Smrkovský]], the chairman of the National Assembly. In autumn of 1969, the Czechoslovak borders were again closed and after that he returned to [[Prague]] from [[Berlin]] where he lectured.

In 1970 he was forced to leave the University. As a Jew he could leave the country whenever he wanted. However he considered it his duty to stay in Czechoslovakia and to resist the repression of the Czech nation by neo-Stalinists. He tried to keep his contacts abroad, and worked mainly for [[Amnesty International]]. In the summer of 1976 Professor [[Jan Patočka]] asked him to become his political advisor. In December 1976 Bergmann took part in the founding of the [[Charter 77]] movement. Together with [[Rudolf Battěk]] he founded the Independent Socialistic Movement in Czechoslovakia. The main reason for the establishment of this movement was to link the movement for human rights in Czechoslovakia with political structures of the democratic West.

In the period 1979 to 1980 he was a co-editor of ''Dialogue: a Cultural and Political Review'', published in a samizdat. In winter 1980, Bergmann and his co-workes formed the Committee of [[Charter 77]]. His very intensive period of political activity culminated in the fall of 1988 with the establishment of the so-called Movement for Civil Liberty which was the direct predecessor of the [[Civic Forum]]. One of the co-founders of it was future president of the Czech Republic, [[Václav Havel]].

The intensive political opposition actively against the Communist regime was crowned in the autumn of 1989 by the establishment of the [[Civic Forum]] which initiated and led the anti-Communist [[Velvet revolution]]. Bergmann worked in a leading position for [[Civic Forum]]. During the revolution Bergmann was one of the renewers of the [[Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party]].

==Political career==

During his life, Bergmann was heavily involved in the politics of Czechoslovakia and later Czech Republic. He was an important member of the [[Dissident]] Movement which was fighting for the independence of Czechoslovakia from the Communist Regime. Bergmann held a number of political positions including:

*1968, Member of the new [[Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party]].
*1968, Advisor to [[Josef Smrkovský]], the chairman of the National Assembly.
*1976, Political Advisor to [[Jan Patočka]].
*1976, Founding Member of [[Charter 77]] movement.
*1976, Founder of the Independent Socialistic Movement in Czechoslovakia, along with [[Rudolf Battěk]]
*1980, Founder of the Committee of [[Charter 77]]
*1988, Part of Movement for Civil Liberty, the direct predecessor to the [[Civic Forum]], alongside future President [[Václav Havel]].
*1989, Leading Advisor for the [[Civic Forum]].
*1990s, One of several renewers behind the newly reformed [[Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party]].

==Personal life==
Bergmann was married once, to Eva Bergmannová and the couple had two sons, scientist Pavel Bergmann Jr. and film producer Daniel Bergmann. The marriage ended in divorce and he had three children with his domestic partner, also named Eva, however they never married. Bergmann died on 17 April 2005 in Prague aged 74. He was survived by his wife, 5 children, and three grandchildren. Bergmann's daughter Julie married sculptor [[Pavel Opočenský]].

Surviving natives continued using fire to clear savanna until European colonists began colonizing the eastern seaboard two hundred years later.  Many colonists continued the practice of burning to clear underbrush, reinforced by their similar experience in Europe, but some land reverted to forest.&lt;ref name=Brown2000 /&gt;

== Postglacial events ==
During the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] about 18,000 years ago, the glacial front in the eastern United States extended south to the approximate location of the [[Missouri River|Missouri]] and [[Ohio River]]. These glaciers destroyed any vegetation in their path, and cooled the climate near their front. Pre-existing natural communities remained largely intact south of the glaciers, but saw an increase in dominance of pine and a now-extinct species of temperate [[spruce]], (''[[Picea crutchfieldii]]''). This area included many plant communities that rely on a lightning-based fire regime, such as the [[longleaf pine]] savanna. When the glaciers began to retreat, the ancient natural communities of the southeast would be the primary source of colonization for the newly exposed areas in the midwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Predicting Pleistocene climate from vegetation in North America |journal=  Climate of the Past  |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=109-118 |url=http://www.clim-past.net/3/109/2007/cp-3-109-2007.pdf |first1=C. |last1=Loehle |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warming and drying during the [[Holocene climatic optimum]] began about 9,000 years ago and affected the vegetation of the southeast.  The prairies and savannas of the southeast expanded their range, and xeric oak and oak-hickory forest types proliferated.  Cooler-climate species migrated northward and upward in elevation.  This retreat caused a proportional increase in pine-dominated forests in the Appalachians.&lt;ref name="Owen2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/sustain/report/terra2/terra2.htm|title=Chapter 2 (TERRA–2): The History of Native Plant Communities in the South|last=Owen|first=Wayne|year=2002|work=Southern Forest Resource Assessment Final Report|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Southern Research Station|accessdate=2008-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about 4,000 years BP, the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] Indian cultures began practising agriculture.  Technology had advanced to the point that pottery was becoming common, and the small-scale felling of trees became feasible.  Concurrently, the Archaic Indians began using fire in a widespread manner. Intentional burning of vegetation was taken up to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories, thereby making travel easier and facilitating the growth of herbs and berry-producing plants that were important for both food and medicines.&lt;ref name=Owen2002 /&gt; In some areas, the effects of Native Americans fires would mimic natural lightning regimes, while in others they would significantly alter the natural communities.&lt;ref name="Lentz2000"&gt;{{cite book|title=Imperfect balance: landscape transformations in the Precolumbian Americas|editor=David L. Lentz|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|year=2000|pages=xviii-xix|isbn=0-231-11157-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Grand Bay NOAA Nerr0754.jpg|thumb|Maritime slash pine savanna]]

From the 16th century on, the [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas#Depopulation from disease|massive depopulation of Native Americans]] caused by the arrival of European settlers meant an end to burning and farming across large areas.&lt;ref name=Owen2002/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...by the time the first European observers were reporting the nature of the vegetation of the region, it is likely to have changed significantly since the regional peak of Indian influence. A myth has developed that prior to European culture the New World was a pristine wilderness. In fact, the vegetation conditions that the European settlers observed were changing rapidly because of aboriginal depopulation. As a result, canopy closure and forest tree density were increasing throughout the region.&lt;ref name=Owen2002/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Historic or remaining savanna areas ==

Savanna surrounded much of the continent's central [[tallgrass prairie]] and [[shortgrass prairie]].  Fire also swept the [[Rocky Mountains]] aspen as frequently as every ten years, creating large areas of parkland.&lt;ref name="Brown2000" /&gt;  In the far southwest was [[California oak woodland]] and [[Fire ecology#Ponderosa pine forests|Ponderosa Pine savanna]], while further north was the [[Oregon White Oak]] savanna.  The [[Central Hardwood Region]] covers a wide belt from northern Minnesota and Wisconsin, down through Iowa, Illinois, northern and central Missouri, eastern Kansas, and central Oklahoma to north-central Texas, with isolated pockets further east around the Great Lakes.&lt;ref name="Dey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/2065|title=Sustaining Oak Ecosystems in the Central Hardwood Region: Lessons from the Past--Continuing the History of Disturbance|last=Dey|first=Daniel C.|author2=Richard P. Guyette|year=2000|work=Trans. 65th No. Amer. Wildl. and Natur. Resour. Conf. p. 170-183|accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Eastern savannas of the United States]] extended further east to the Atlantic seaboard.

In the southeast, [[longleaf pine]] dominated the savanna and open-floored forests which once covered {{convert|92000000|acre|km2}} from Virginia to Texas.  These covered 36% of the region's land and 52% of the upland areas.  Of this, less than 1% of the unaltered forest still stands.&lt;ref name=PIF2001&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/wildlife/plan/pl_03_10.pdf|title=Partners in Flight Bird Conservation Plan for The South Atlantic Coastal Plain (Physiographic Area 03) |last=Hunter |first=William C. |author2=Lori H. Peoples |author3=Jaime A. Collazo |date=May 2001 |pages=10–12, 63–64 |accessdate=2008-07-20|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Eastern Deciduous Forest, frequent fires kept open [[Kentucky bluegrass]] areas which supported herds of bison.  A substantial portion of this forest was extensively burned by agricultural Native Americans.  Annual burning created many large oaks and white pines with little understory.&lt;ref name="Telfer2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Telfer|first=Edmund S.|title=Wildland fire in ecosystems: effects of fire on fauna.|editor=Jane Kapler Smith|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station|location=Ogden, UT|date=January 2000|volume=1|pages=9–15|chapter=Regional Variation in Fire Regimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Southeastern Pine Region, from Texas to Virginia, is characterized by longleaf, slash, loblolly, shortleaf, and sand pines.  Lightning and humans burned the understory of longleaf pine every 1 to 15 years from Archaic periods until widespread fire suppression practices were adopted in the 1930s.  Burning to manage wildlife habitat did continue and was a common practice by 1950.  Longleaf pine dominated the coastal plains until the early 1900s, where loblolly and slash pines now dominate.&lt;ref name="Telfer2000" /&gt;

At low altitudes in the Rocky Mountain region, large areas of Ponderosa pine and Douglas fir had an open park-like structure until the 1900s.  In California's Sierra Nevada area, frequent fires kept clear the understory of stands of both Ponderosa pines and giant Sequoia.&lt;ref name="Telfer2000" /&gt;

== Destruction of the savannas ==

Industrialized sawmills in the early 20th Century cleared many tall savanna old-growth trees, while [[fire suppression]] methods adopted in the 1930s and 1940s stopped much of the regular burning which the savanna required.&lt;ref name=Brown2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GOBER&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestry.state.al.us/publication/TF_publications/tffall99/products_of_the_longleaf_pine.pdf |title=Products of the Longleaf Pine |last=GOBER |first=JIM R. |accessdate=2008-07-20 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007170731/http://www.forestry.state.al.us/publication/TF_publications/tffall99/products_of_the_longleaf_pine.pdf |archivedate=October 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biswell|first=Harold|author2=James Agee|title=Prescribed Burning in California Wildlands Vegetation Management  |publisher=University of California Press|year=1999|pages=86|isbn=0-520-21945-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the latter half of the 20th Century many researchers had rediscovered both the prehistoric use of fire and methods to practice burning, but by then almost all prairie and savanna lands had been converted to agriculture or succeeded to full-canopy [[forest]].  Modern conservation of savanna includes controlled burning, and at present about {{convert|6000000|acre|km2}} a year are burned.&lt;ref name=Brown2000 /&gt;

'''Ptolemy I Soter''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɒ|l|əm|i}}; {{lang-gr|Πτολεμαῖος Σωτήρ}}, ''Ptolemaĩos Sōtḗr'' "Ptolemy [[Soter|the Savior]]"; c. 367 BC – January 282 BC) was a [[Macedonian Greek general]] and historian of [[Alexander the Great]] who succeeded to [[Empire of Alexander the Great|his empire]]. Ptolemy became ruler of [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Egypt]] (323–282 BC) and founded the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] which ruled it for the next three centuries, turning [[Egypt]] into a [[Hellenistic culture|Hellenistic]] kingdom and [[Alexandria]] into a center of [[Greek culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ancient.eu/Ptolemaic_Dynasty/ Ptolemaic Dynasty at Ancient History Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ptolemy was the son of [[Arsinoe of Macedon]] by either her husband [[Lagus]] or [[Philip II of Macedon]], the father of Alexander. Ptolemy was one of Alexander's most trusted companions and military officers. He had been an intimate friend of Alexander since childhood.

Ptolemy's mother was [[Arsinoe of Macedon]], and, while his father is unknown, ancient sources variously describe him either as the son of [[Lagus]], a Macedonian nobleman, or as an illegitimate son of [[Philip II of Macedon]] (though this claim may have just been made to legitimize his right to rule by claiming to be of royal blood). The paternity of the latter, if true, would have made Ptolemy the half-brother of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. It is possible that this is a later myth fabricated to glorify the Ptolemaic dynasty. However, the genealogical strands preserved in a number of accounts state Ptolemy is presented as having direct blood relationships with the Argead kings. [[Satyrus the Peripatetic]] traced the patrilineal descent of Arsinoe directly through Macedonian kings, back to Hercules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carney|first1=Elizabeth|title=Philip II and Alexander The Great: Father and Son, Lives and Afterlives|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-973815-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Alexander died in 323 BC, Ptolemy is said to have instigated the settlement of the empire made at [[Babylon]]. Through the [[Partition of Babylon]], he was appointed [[satrap]] of [[Egypt]], under the nominal kings [[Philip III of Macedon|Philip III Arrhidaeus]] and the infant [[Alexander IV of Macedon|Alexander IV]]; the former satrap, the Greek [[Cleomenes of Naucratis|Cleomenes]], stayed on as his deputy. Ptolemy quickly moved, without authorization, to subjugate [[Cyrenaica]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=616}}

By custom, kings in Macedonia asserted their right to the throne by burying their predecessor. Probably because he wanted to pre-empt [[Perdiccas]], the imperial regent, from staking his claim in this way, Ptolemy took great pains in acquiring the body of Alexander the Great, placing it temporarily in [[Memphis, Egypt]]. Ptolemy then openly joined the coalition against Perdiccas. Perdiccas appears to have suspected Ptolemy of aiming for the throne himself, and may have decided that Ptolemy was his most dangerous rival. Ptolemy executed Cleomenes for spying on behalf of Perdiccas; this removed the chief check on his authority, and allowed Ptolemy to obtain the huge sum that Cleomenes had accumulated.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Peter (1990).

In 321 BC, Perdiccas attempted to invade Egypt, only to fall at the hands of his own men.&lt;ref&gt;Anson, Edward M (Summer 1986). "Diodorus and the Date of Triparadeisus". ''The American Journal of Philology'' (The Johns Hopkins University Press) 107 (2): 208–217. {{doi|10.2307/294603}}. {{JSTOR|294603}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy's decision to defend the [[Nile]] against Perdiccas ended in fiasco for Perdiccas, with the loss of 2,000 men. This failure was a fatal blow to Perdiccas' reputation, and he was murdered in his tent by two of his subordinates. Ptolemy immediately crossed the Nile, to provide supplies to what had the day before been an enemy army. Ptolemy was offered the regency in place of Perdiccas; but he declined.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Green p14&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy was consistent in his policy of securing a power base, while never succumbing to the temptation of risking all to succeed Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Green pp 119&lt;/ref&gt;

In the long wars that followed between the different [[Diadochi]], Ptolemy's first goal was to hold Egypt securely, and his second was to secure control in the outlying areas: Cyrenaica and [[Cyprus]], as well as [[Coele-Syria|Syria]], including the province of [[Judea]]. His first occupation of Syria was in 318, and he established at the same time a protectorate over the petty kings of Cyprus. When [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus One-Eye]], master of Asia in 315, showed expansionist ambitions, Ptolemy joined the coalition against him, and on the outbreak of war, evacuated Syria. In Cyprus, he fought the partisans of Antigonus, and re-conquered the island (313). A revolt in [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] was crushed the same year.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=616}}

In 312, Ptolemy and [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], the fugitive satrap of Babylonia, both invaded Syria, and defeated [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius]] Poliorcetes ("besieger of cities"), the son of Antigonus, in the [[Battle of Gaza (312 BC)|Battle of Gaza]]. Again he occupied Syria, and again—after only a few months, when Demetrius had won a battle over his general, and Antigonus entered [[Syria]] in force—he evacuated it. In 311, a peace was concluded between the combatants. Soon after this, the surviving 13-year-old king, Alexander IV, was murdered in Macedonia on the orders of Cassander, leaving the satrap of Egypt absolutely his own master.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=616}}

The peace did not last long, and in 309 Ptolemy personally commanded a fleet that detached the coastal towns of [[Lycia]] and [[Caria]] from Antigonus, then crossed into Greece, where he took possession of [[Corinth]], [[Sicyon]] and [[Megara]] (308 BC). In 306, a great fleet under Demetrius attacked Cyprus, and Ptolemy's brother [[Menelaus (son of Lagus)|Menelaus]] was defeated and captured in another decisive [[Battle of Salamis (306 BC)|Battle of Salamis]]. Ptolemy's complete loss of Cyprus followed.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=616}}

The satraps Antigonus and Demetrius now each assumed the title of king; Ptolemy, as well as [[Cassander]], [[Lysimachus]] and [[Seleucus I Nicator]], responded by doing the same. In the winter of 306 BC, Antigonus tried to follow up his victory in Cyprus by invading Egypt; but Ptolemy was strongest there, and successfully held the frontier against him. Ptolemy led no further overseas expeditions against Antigonus.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=617}} However, he did send great assistance to [[Rhodes]] when it was [[Siege of Rhodes (305–304 BC)|besieged by Demetrius (305/304)]]. The Rhodians granted divine honors to Ptolemy as a result of the lifting of the siege.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/sources/content/diodorus/the-siege-of-rhodes/ Siege of Rhodes at Livius.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the coalition against Antigonus was renewed in 302, Ptolemy joined it, and invaded Syria a third time, while Antigonus was engaged with Lysimachus in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]]. On hearing a report that Antigonus had won a decisive victory there, he once again evacuated Syria. But when the news came that Antigonus had been defeated and slain by Lysimachus and Seleucus at the [[Battle of Ipsus]] in 301, he occupied Syria a fourth time.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=617}}

The other members of the coalition had assigned all Syria to Seleucus, after what they regarded as Ptolemy's desertion, and for the next hundred years, the question of the ownership of southern Syria (i.e., Judea) produced recurring warfare between the [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucid]] and Ptolemaic dynasties. Henceforth, Ptolemy seems to have involved himself as little as possible in the rivalries between [[Asia Minor]] and [[Greece]]; he lost what he held in Greece, but reconquered Cyprus in 295/294. [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], after a series of rebellions, was finally subjugated in about 300 and placed under his stepson [[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=617}}

==Lost history of Alexander's campaigns==
Ptolemy himself wrote an eyewitness history of Alexander's campaigns (now lost).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker, Teil 2, Zeitgeschichte. – B. Spezialgeschichten, Autobiographien und Memoiren, Zeittafeln [Nr. 106-261]|last=Jacoby|first=Felix|publisher=Weidmann|year=1926|oclc=769308142|location=Berlin|pages=752–769, no. 138, "Ptolemaios Lagu"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second century AD, Ptolemy's history was used by [[Arrian]] of Nicomedia as one of his two main primary sources (alongside the history of [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia|Aristobulus]] of [[Cassandreia]]) for his own extant ''[[The Anabasis of Alexander|Anabasis]]'' of Alexander, and hence large parts of Ptolemy's history can be assumed to survive in paraphrase or précis in Arrian's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Arrian to Alexander: Studies in Historical Interpretation|last=Bosworth|first=A. B.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0198148630|location=Oxford|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrian cites Ptolemy by name on only a few occasions, but it is likely that large stretches of Arrian's ''Anabasis'' reflect Ptolemy's version of events. Arrian once names Ptolemy as the author "whom I chiefly follow",&lt;ref&gt;''Anabasis'' [[s:The Anabasis of Alexander/Book VI/Chapter II|6.2.4]]&lt;/ref&gt; and in his Preface claims that Ptolemy seemed to him to be a particularly trustworthy source, "not only because he was present with Alexander on campaign, but also because he was himself a king, and hence lying would be more dishonourable for him than for anyone else".&lt;ref&gt;''Anabasis'', [[s:The Anabasis of Alexander#6|Prologue]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ptolemy's lost history was long considered an objective work, distinguished by its straightforward honesty and sobriety,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=617}} but more recent work has called this assessment into question. R. M. Errington argued that Ptolemy's history was characterised by persistent bias and self-aggrandisement, and by systematic blackening of the reputation of [[Perdiccas]], one of Ptolemy's chief dynastic rivals after Alexander's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Errington|first=R. M.|date=1969-01-01|title=Bias in Ptolemy's History of Alexander|jstor=637545|journal=The Classical Quarterly|volume=19|issue=2|pages=233–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Arrian's account of the fall of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] in 335 BC (''Anabasis'' [[s:The Anabasis of Alexander/Book I/Chapter VIII|1.8.1–1.8.8]], a rare section of narrative explicitly attributed to Ptolemy by Arrian) shows several significant variations from the parallel account preserved in [[Diodorus Siculus]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/17A*.html#8.3 17.11–12]), most notably in attributing a distinctly unheroic role in proceedings to Perdiccas. More recently, J. Roisman has argued that the case for Ptolemy's blackening of Perdiccas and others has been much exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roisman|first=Joseph|date=1984-01-01|title=Ptolemy and His Rivals in His History of Alexander|jstor=638295|journal=The Classical Quarterly|volume=34|issue=2|pages=373–385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Euclid==
Ptolemy personally sponsored the great [[Greek mathematics|mathematician]] [[Euclid]]. He found Euclid's seminal work, the ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', too difficult to study, so he asked if there were an easier way to master it. According to [[Proclus]] Euclid famously quipped: "Sire, there is no [[Royal Road]] to [[geometry]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Victor|title=The Story of Medicine|year=2005|location=Whitefish, Montana|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-1-4191-5431-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZAaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=The+Story+of+Medicine|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11399">[[File:Rafael Larco Hoyle at excavation.jpg|thumb|right|Rafael Larco Hoyle at an excavation at Peru, 1935.]]
'''Rafael Larco Hoyle''' (18 May 1901 in [[Chicama|Chicama Valley]], [[Peru]] &amp;ndash; 23 October 1966, [[Lima]]), raised at Chiclin, his family's estate, was sent to school in [[Maryland]], United States, at the age of twelve. He later entered [[Cornell university|Cornell University]] to study [[agricultural engineering]] and by 1923 returned to Peru to work on the family's [[sugar cane]] plantation. After spending most of his youth abroad, Larco Hoyle arrived to Peru with the eyes of an outsider. With this foreigner's curiosity he explored the country and discovered an ancient cultural patrimony in the north coast.  Larco Hoyle recognized the need to house these objects in a safe place. It was at that point, Larco Hoyle dreamt of a museum, one like he had seen in the United States.

In 1925, Larco Hoyle's father, Rafael Larco Herrera acquired a collection of vases and other archaeological pieces from Alfredo Hoyle, his brother-in-law. There were approximately 600 ceramic pieces in all. The arrival of these objects ignited a collector's enthusiasm in Larco Hoyle. Soon after, Larco Herrera left his son in charge of the collection and those pieces completed the first collection of what would become the Rafael Larco Herrera Museum.

During that same year, Larco Hoyle received some advice from his uncle, Victor Larco Herrera, a founder of the first museum in Lima. He urged Larco Hoyle to form a new museum in Lima, one that could guard all the archaeological relics that were continually being extracted by clandestine excavators.

Larco Hoyle agreed with his uncle. He yearned to erect a living monument in honor of his father whom he admired so much for his patriotism and love for Peru. He got to work creating a museum that would carry on his father's legacy. Larco Hoyle purchased two large collections: 8000 pieces from Roa and 6000 pieces from Carranza. He also purchased several small collections in Chicama Valley, [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], [[Virú Province|Virú]], and [[Chimbote]]. Within a year, the collection had grown significantly and display cases were installed in a small house on the Chiclín estate. On July 28, 1926, Independence Day, the [[Larco Museum|Rafael Larco Herrera Museum]] opened its doors to the public.

With the museum up and running and a collection of approximately 30,000 pieces, Larco Hoyle began classifying the collection. Peruvian archaeology was in its infancy and Larco Hoyle realized many typologies were yet to be recognized. He set out to correct that and approached archaeological research academically. During the 1930s, he discovered many distinct [[Pre-Inca cultures|Peruvian cultures]] such as Viru, Salinar, [[Cupisnique]], and [[Lambayeque culture|Lambayeque]]. The focus of his research became the Mochica culture. In 1946, Larco Hoyle, director of the [[Larco Museum]], developed the first Peruvian chronology of ancient cultures, one that has remained current.

== Career ==
Susanna K. Elm is the daughter of historian [[:de:Kaspar Elm|Kaspar Elm]].  She graduated from the [[Gymnasium Leopoldinum]] in [[Detmold]] in 1978.  Afterwards, she studied Classical Philology and History at [[Freie Universität Berlin]].  In 1986, she graduated from [[St Hilda's College, Oxford]], where her doctoral thesis, ''The Organisation and Institutions of Female Asceticism in Fourth Century Cappadocia and Egypt'', was supervised by classical historian, John F. Matthews.  She then worked as an analyst at [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.|Morgan Guaranty Trust]] for a year before becoming assistant professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1989. In 1994, she became an associate professor and has held a professorship at Berkeley since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/7215310/curriculum-vitae-susanna-elm-department-of-history-dwinelle-|title=CURRICULUM VITAE Susanna Elm Department of History, Dwinelle ...|last=Yumpu.com|newspaper=yumpu.com|access-date=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Elm was part of a University of California research team that won the [[Society for Classical Studies|American Philological Association (APA)]] Prize for Scholarly Outreach for creating middle-school course materials on the fall of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucr.edu/1760|title=UCR Newsroom: Antiquity Research Group Honored|website=newsroom.ucr.edu|language=en|access-date=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her publications include ''Virgins of God: The Making of Asceticism in Late Antiquity'' (Clarendon, 1994/1996); ''Medical Challenges for the New Millennium: An Interdisciplinary Task'' (Kluver, 2001), co-edited with Stefan Willich; and ''Sons of Hellenism, Fathers of the Church (University of California, 2012).''  She has received a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] as well as fellowships from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] (1995), the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and the [[Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanacademy.de/home/person/susanna-elm|title=Susanna Elm {{!}} American Academy in Berlin|website=www.americanacademy.de|language=en|access-date=January 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202074454/http://www.americanacademy.de/home/person/susanna-elm|archive-date=February 2, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Virgins of God'' was a development of her doctoral thesis about female asceticism in early Christianity.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;  Enthusiastic religious women sought virtue by engaging in [[spiritual marriage]] or becoming [[anchoress]]es.  Elm recounted how the religious hierarchy restrained such practises, condemning some of them as heresy.  Doug Lee, writing in ''The Classical Review'', praised the work as a "stimulating exposition which negotiates the complexities of the source material and subject matter with skill and assurance. ...one of the many strengths of the study is E's exploitation of little-known sources such as an anonymous treatise ''On Virginity'' (pp. 34–9 331–6) and [[Athanasius]]' ''Letter to the Virgins Who Went to Jerusalem'' (pp. 331–6)."&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{citation |jstor=714136 |title=Review: Virgins of God |first=A. D. |last=Lee |journal= The Classical Review |volume=49 |number=2 |year=1999 |pages=451–453 |publisher=Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Classical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her book, ''Sons of Hellenism, Fathers of the Church'' was described by the [[Bryn Mawr Classical Review]] as 'a welcome and erudite study of Gregory of Nazianzus's intellectual engagement with the emperor Julian.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Storin|first=Bradley K.|date=January 23, 2017|title=Review of: Sons of Hellenism, Fathers of the Church: Emperor Julian, Gregory of Nazianzus, and the Vision of Rome.

In a 2016 interview for ''Studies in Late Antiquity'', a journal which she edits, she described her writing and research as 'an integrated approach that combines written sources from authors that are Christian and non-Christian with documentary and material sources.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/blog/23147/editors-spotlight-meet-susanna-elm-associate-editor-of-studies-in-late-antiquity/|title=Editor’s Spotlight: Meet Susanna Elm, associate editor of Studies in Late Antiquity|language=en-US|access-date=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1980s ===

* In the U.S., the early 1980s were marked by the end of the second wave and the beginning of the [[feminist sex wars]]. Many historians view the second-wave feminist era in America as ending in the early 1980s with the intra-feminism disputes of the feminist sex wars over issues such as sexuality and pornography, which ushered in the era of [[third-wave feminism]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="end"&gt;As noted in:

'''''Translatio imperii''''' ([[Latin]] for "transfer of rule") is a [[Historiography|historiographical]] concept, originating in the [[Middle Ages]], in which history is viewed as a linear succession of transfers of an ''[[imperium]]'' that invests supreme power in a singular ruler, an "[[emperor]]" (or sometimes even several emperors, e.g., the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] and the Western [[Holy Roman Empire]]). The concept is closely linked to ''[[translatio studii]]'' (the geographic movement of learning). Both terms are thought to have their origins in the second chapter of the [[Book of Daniel]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] (verses 39–40).&lt;ref&gt;Carol Ann Newsom and Brennan W. Breed, ''Daniel: A Commentary'', Westminster John Knox Press, 2014, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
[[Jacques Le Goff]]&lt;ref name="Le Goff"&gt;Le Goff, Jacques. ''La civilisation de l'Occident médieval''. Paris. 1964; English translation (1988): ''Medieval Civilization'', {{ISBN|0-631-17566-0}} &amp;ndash; "translatio imperii" is discussed in Part II, Chapter VI, section on "Time, eternity and history".&lt;/ref&gt; describes the ''translatio imperii'' concept as "typical" for the Middle Ages for several reasons:
* the idea of linearity of time and history was typical for the Middle Ages;
* the ''translatio imperii'' idea typically also neglected simultaneous developments in other parts of the world (of no importance to medieval Europeans);
* the ''translatio imperii'' idea didn't separate "divine" history from the history of "worldly power": medieval Europeans considered divine (supernatural) and material things as part of the same continuum, which was their reality. Also the causality of one reign necessarily leading to its successor was often detailed by the medieval chroniclers, and is seen as a typical medieval approach.

Each medieval author described the ''translatio imperii'' as a succession leaving the supreme power in the hands of the monarch ruling the region of the author's provenance:
* [[Adso of Montier-en-Der]] (French area, 10th century): Roman Empire → [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian Franks]] → '''[[Saxons]]'''&lt;ref name=latowsky&gt;{{cite book|title=Emperor of the World: Charlemagne and the Construction of Imperial Authority, 800–1229|first=Anne A.|last=Latowsky|publisher=Cornell UP|year=2013|isbn=9780801451485|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Otto of Freising]] (living in German region): [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] → [[Byzantium]] → [[Franks]] → [[Longobards]] → '''[[Germany|Germans]]''' (=[[Holy Roman Empire]]);
* [[Chrétien de Troyes]] (living in medieval France): [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] → Rome → '''[[Medieval France|France]]'''&lt;ref&gt;De Troyes, Chrétien. ''[[Cligès]]''. Circa 1176.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Richard de Bury]] (England, 14th century): "Athens" (Greece) → Rome → "Paris" (France) → '''[[England]]'''

Later, continued and reinterpreted by modern and contemporary movements and authors (some known examples):
* [[Fifth Monarchists]] (England, 17th century): [[Babylonian Empire|Caldeans (Babylonians)]] → [[Persian Empire|Persians]] → [[Macedonian Empire]] → Rome → '''England''' (and the '''[[British Empire]]''' later)
* [[António Vieira]] (Portugal, 17th century): [[Assyrian Empire|Assyro]]-[[Babylonian Empire|Caldeans (Babylonians)]] → Persians → Greeks → Romans → '''[[Portuguese Empire]]'''
* [[Fernando Pessoa]] (Portugal, 20th century): Greece → Rome → [[Christianity]] → [[Europe]] → '''[[Portugal]]'''

Medieval and Renaissance authors often linked this transfer of power by genealogically attaching a ruling family to an ancient Greek or Trojan hero; this schema was modeled on [[Virgil]]'s use of [[Aeneas]] (a [[Troy|Trojan]] hero) as progenitor of the city of [[Rome]] in his ''[[Aeneid]]''.  Continuing with this tradition, the twelfth-century Anglo-Norman authors [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] (in his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'') and [[Wace]] (in his ''[[Roman de Brut|Brut]]'') linked the founding of [[Iron Age Britain|Britain]] to the arrival of [[Brutus of Troy]], son of Aeneas.&lt;ref&gt;Bratu, Cristian. "Translatio, autorité et affirmation de soi chez Gaimar, Wace et Benoît de Sainte-Maure." The Medieval Chronicle 8 (2013): 135-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar way, the French Renaissance author [[Jean Lemaire de Belges]] (in his ''Les Illustrations de Gaule et Singularités de Troie'') linked the founding of Celtic [[Gaul]] to the arrival of the Trojan [[Francus]] (i.e. [[Astyanax]]), the son of [[Hector]]; and of Celtic Germany to the arrival of Bavo, the cousin of [[Priam]]; in this way he established an illustrious genealogy for [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]] and [[Charlemagne]] (the legend of Francus would also serve as the basis for [[Ronsard]]'s epic poem, "La Franciade").

== From the Byzantine to the Holy Roman Empire ==
The cardinal point in the idea of the ''Translatio imperii'' is the link between the Byzantine to the Holy Roman Empire.
*[[Constantine the Great|Emperor Constantine I]] established [[Constantinople]], a [[New Rome]], as a second capital of the [[Roman Empire]] in 330.
*After the death of [[Theodosius I|Emperor Theodosius I]], the Roman Empire is permanently divided into the [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] (Byzantine Empire).
*With the demise of the Western Empire in 476, the Byzantine Empire remained as the sole Roman Empire.
*Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]] married his son [[Leo IV the Khazar|Leo IV]] to [[Irene of Athens]] on 17 December 768, brought to [[Constantinople]] by the father on 1 November 768. On 14 January 771, Irene gave birth to a son, [[Constantine VI|Constantine]]. Following the deaths of Constantine V in 775 and Leo IV in 780, Irene became [[regent]] for their nine-year-old son, [[Constantine VI]].
*As early as 781, Irene began to seek a closer relationship with the Carolingian dynasty and the Papacy. She negotiated a marriage between her son Constantine and Rotrude, a daughter of Frankish king Charlemagne. Irene went as far as to send an official to instruct the Frankish princess in Greek; however, Irene herself broke off the engagement in 787, against her son's wishes. 
*As [[Constantine VI]] approached maturity, the relationship between mother/regent and son/emperor was increasingly strained. In 797 Irene deposed her son, who died soon afterwards.
*Some western authorities considered the Byzantine throne, now occupied by a woman, to be vacant and recognized that Charlemagne, who controlled Italy and many of the cities of the Western Roman Empire, had a valid claim to the imperial name. [[Pope Leo III]], crowned Charlemagne as [[Holy Roman Emperor|Roman Emperor]] in 800, an act not recognized by the Byzantine Empire.
*Irene is said to have endeavoured to negotiate a marriage between herself and Charlemagne, but according to [[Theophanes the Confessor]], who alone mentions it, the scheme was frustrated by [[Aetios (eunuch)|Aetios]], one of her favourites.&lt;ref&gt;See Garland, p. 89, who explains that Aetios was attempting to usurp power on behalf of his brother Leo.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 802, Empress Irene was deposed by a conspiracy and replaced by [[Nikephoros I]]. She was exiled and died the following year.
* ''[[Pax Nicephori]]'',  a [[peace treaty]] in 803 between the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charlemagne]] and [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Nikephoros I]], [[Basileus]] of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].
* Recognition of [[Charlemagne]] as [[Emperor]] ([[Basileus]]) in 812 by Emperor [[Michael I Rangabe]] of the Byzantine Empire (crowned on 2 October 811 by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]]), after he reopened negotiations with the [[Franks]]. In exchange for that recognition, [[Venice]] was returned to the Byzantine Empire.
* On February 2, 962, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] was solemnly crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] by [[Pope John XII]]. Ten days later at a Roman synod, Pope John XII, at Otto's desire, founded the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg]] and the [[Bishopric of Merseburg]], bestowed the [[pallium]] on the [[Archbishop of Salzburg]] and [[Archbishop of Trier]], and confirmed the appointment of [[Ratherius|Rather]] as [[Bishop of Verona]]. The next day, the emperor issued a decree, the famous ''[[Diploma Ottonianum]]'', in which he confirmed the Roman Church in its possessions, particularly those granted by the [[Donation of Pepin]].

'''Universal jurisdiction''' allows [[Sovereign state|state]]s or [[international organization]]s to claim criminal [[jurisdiction]] over an accused person regardless of where the alleged crime was committed, and regardless of the accused's nationality, country of [[Residency (domicile)|residence]], or any other relation with the prosecuting entity. Crimes prosecuted under universal jurisdiction are considered crimes against all, too serious to tolerate [[jurisdictional arbitrage]]. &lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph--&gt;

The concept of universal jurisdiction is therefore closely linked to the idea that some international norms are ''[[erga omnes]]'', or owed to the entire world community, as well as the concept of ''[[jus cogens]]'' – that certain international law obligations are binding on all states.&lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lyal S. Sunga]] Individual Responsibility in International Law for Serious Human Rights Violations, Nijhoff (1992) 252 p. {{ISBN|978-0-7923-1453-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Commentaries on the Roman Law'', Book I, Chapter I, "De Jure Gentium et Civili".&lt;/ref&gt; says that "All nations ... are governed partly by their own particular laws, and partly by those laws which are common to all, [those that] natural Reason appoints for all mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Maine| first =Sir Henry Sumner| title =Ancient Law: Its Connection With the Early History of Society and Relation to Modern Ideas| publisher =John Murray| publication-place = London | edition = 1861 first| date =| page = 46| language = | isbn =| url = https://archive.org/stream/ancientlawitsco18maingoog#page/n58/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding on the classical understanding of universal law accessible by reason, in the seventeenth century, the Dutch jurist [[Grotius]] laid the foundations for universal jurisdiction in modern international law, promulgating in his ''De Jure Pradae'' (''Of the Law of Captures'') and later ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'' (''Of the Law of War and Peace'') the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] view that there are universal principles of right and wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grotius|authorlink=Grotius |title=[[De Jure Pradae (book)|De Jure Pradæ: (Of the Law of Captures)]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=London |year=1604 |pages=xviii |isbn=}} (discussing in introductory notes Grotius' account of universal principles of right and wrong derived from reason and divine Will, the underpinning of much modern international law).&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, international law came to recognize the analogous concept of ''[[hostes humani generis]]'' ("enemies of the human race"): pirates, hijackers, and similar outlaws whose crimes were typically committed outside the territory of any state. The notion that heads of state and senior public officials should be treated like pirates or outlaws before the global bar of justice is, according to Henry Kissinger, a new gloss on this old concept.&lt;ref name=HK-2001/&gt; From these premises, representing the Enlightenment belief in trans-territorial, trans-cultural standards of right and wrong, derives universal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Anthony Pagden|title=The Enlightenment, and Why It Still Matters |year=2013 |publisher=Random House |quote= [I]f there does exist some concept of universal justice, if even the most powerful states on occasion feel compelled to abide by the demands of international law, that we owe to the Enlightenment. | url= |isbn=978-1-4000-6068-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most notable and influential precedent for universal jurisdiction were the mid-20th century [[Nuremberg Trials]]. U.S. Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] then chief prosecutor, famously stated that an [[International Military Tribunal]] enforcing universal principles of right and wrong could prosecute acts without a particular geographic location, Nazi "crimes against the peace of the world"—even if the acts were perfectly legal at the time in Fascist Germany. Indeed, one charge was Nazi law itself became a crime, law distorted into a bludgeon of oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/nuremberg/jackson.html |title=Justice Jackson's Opening statement for the Prosecution |author=Jackson, Robert, U.S. Supreme Court Justice  |date=21 November 1945 |work= Proceedings, Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal|publisher=International Military Tribunal |accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nuremberg trials supposed universal standards by which one nation's laws, and acts of its officials, can be judged; an international rule of law unbound by national borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jack Goldsmith |title=The Shadow of Nuremberg |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/books/review/justice-and-the-enemy-nuremberg-9-11-and-the-trial-of-khalid-sheikh-mohammed-by-william-shawcross-book-review.html |quote=The compromises of 1945 came to be seen as imperfect but essential progress toward international rule of law and the foundation for modern international criminal tribunals. |work=[[New York Times]] |date= January 20, 2012|accessdate=2016-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, even at the time the Nuremberg trials appeared to be victor's justice, revenge papered over with legal simulcra. US Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Harlan F. Stone|Harlan Fiske Stone]] remarked that his colleague Justice Jackson acting as Nuremberg Chief prosecutor was "conducting his high-grade lynching party in Nuremberg. I don't mind what he does to the Nazis, but I hate to see the pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law. This is a little too sanctimonious a fraud to meet my old-fashioned ideas."&lt;ref&gt;Alpheus T. Mason, Harlan Fiske Stone: Pillar of the Law (New York: Viking, 1956), p. 716.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenneth Roth]], the executive director of [[Human Rights Watch]], argues that universal jurisdiction allowed Israel to try [[Adolf Eichmann]] in Jerusalem in 1961. Roth also argues that clauses in treaties such as the [[Geneva Convention]]s of 1949 and the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] of 1984, which requires signatory states to pass [[municipal law]]s that are based on the concept of universal jurisdiction, indicate widespread international acceptance of the concept.&lt;ref name=KR-2001/&gt;

==Universal distinct from extraterritorial jurisdiction==
Universal jurisdiction differs from a state's prosecuting crimes under its own laws, whether on its own territory ([[territorial jurisdiction]]) or  abroad ([[extraterritorial jurisdiction]]). As an example, the United States asserts jurisdiction over stateless vessels carrying illicit drugs on international waters—but here the US reaches across national borders to enforce its own law, rather than invoking universal jurisdiction and trans-national standards of right and wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Neil Boister |title=An Introduction to Transnational Criminal Law |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |quote=   | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kElWbHK0JF8C&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=us+transnational+criminal+jurisdiction&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ohc-p-b-Tm&amp;sig=BSde-49gTF84cpZEEwvpzCvEX5U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZzt_XlsjLAhWHVh4KHYfrDyAQ6AEIZzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=us%20transnational%20criminal%20jurisdiction&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-19-960538-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

States attempting to police acts committed by foreign nationals on foreign territory tends to be more controversial than a state prosecuting its own citizens wherever they may be found. Bases on which a state might exercise jurisdiction in this way include the following:

*The least controversial basis is that under which a state can exercise jurisdiction over acts that affect the fundamental interests of the state, such as [[espionage|spying]], even if the act was committed by foreign nationals on foreign territory. For example, the Indian [[Information Technology Act 2000]] largely supports the extraterritoriality of the said Act. The law states that a contravention of the Act that affects any computer or computer network situated in India will be punishable by India irrespective of the culprit's location and nationality.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}&lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph--&gt;
*Also relatively non-controversial is the ability of a state to try its own nationals for crimes committed abroad. France and some other nations will refuse to [[extradition|extradite]] their own citizens as a matter of law, but will instead try them on their own territory for crimes committed abroad.
*More controversial is the exercise of jurisdiction where the victim of the crime is a national of the state exercising jurisdiction. In the past some states have claimed this jurisdiction (e.g., Mexico, ''Cutting Case'' (1887)), while others have been strongly opposed to it (e.g., the United States, except in cases in which an American citizen is a victim: ''US v Yunis'' (1988)). In more recent years, however, a broad global consensus has emerged in permitting its use in the case of torture, "forced disappearances" or terrorist offences (due in part to it being permitted by the various United Nations conventions on terrorism); but its application in other areas is still highly controversial. For example, former dictator of Chile [[Augusto Pinochet]] was arrested in London in 1998, on Spanish judge [[Baltazar Garzon]]'s demand, on charges of human rights abuses, not on the grounds of universal jurisdiction but rather on the grounds that some of the victims of the abuses committed in Chile were Spanish citizens. Spain then sought his [[extradition]] from Britain, again, not on the grounds of universal jurisdiction, but by invoking the law of the [[European Union]] regarding extradition; and he was finally released on grounds of health. Argentinian [[Alfredo Astiz]]'s sentence is part of this juridical frame.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}&lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph and specifically for the quote--&gt;

==International tribunals invoking universal jurisdiction==
[[File:ICC member states world map.png|thumb|States parties to the Statute of the [[International Criminal Court]] (light green means ratification or accession deposited but not yet in force, brown means signed but not yet ratified).]]
Established in [[The Hague]] in 2002, the International Criminal Court (ICC) is an international tribunal of general jurisdiction (defined by treaty) to prosecute state-members' citizens for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression, as specified by several international agreements, most prominently the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] signed in 1998.  Universal jurisdiction over the crimes enumerated in the Rome Statute was rejected by the signing parties, however universal jurisdiction is what allows the United Nations Security Council to refer specific situations to the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1317&amp;context=bjil&lt;/ref&gt;  This has only happened with Darfur (2005) and Libya (2011).

In addition the United Nations has set up geographically specific courts to investigate and prosecute crimes against humanity under a theory of universal jurisdiction, such as the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (1994), and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (1993).

The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia investigates war crimes that took place in the Balkans in the 1990s.  It convicted former Bosnian Serb leader [[Radovan Karadžić]] on 10 charges relating to directing murders, purges and other abuses against civilians, including genocide in connection with the 1995 massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica; he was sentenced to 40 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Brian Murphy  |title=U.N. tribunal finds former Bosnia Serb leader guilty of genocide |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/un-tribunal-finds-former-bosnia-serb-leader-guilty-of-genocide/2016/03/24/1a9f1066-f1c9-11e5-85a6-2132cf446d0a_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_karadzic_11am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory |quote= |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=March 24, 2016 |accessdate=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Particular states invoking universal jurisdiction==
Universal jurisdiction may be asserted by a particular nation as well as by an international tribunal. The result is the same: individuals become answerable for crimes defined and prosecuted regardless of where they live, or where the conduct occurred; crimes said to be so grievous as to be universally condemned.

Amnesty International argues that since the end of the Second World War over fifteen states have conducted investigations, commenced prosecutions and completed trials based on universal jurisdiction for the crimes or arrested people with a view to extraditing the persons to a state seeking to prosecute them. These states include: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, [[Israel]], Mexico, Netherlands, [[Senegal]], Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref name="AI-FAQ"/&gt;  Amnesty writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt; All states parties to the [[UN Convention Against Torture|Convention against Torture]] and the [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture|Inter-American Convention]] are obliged whenever a person suspected of torture is found in their territory to submit the case to their prosecuting authorities for the purposes of prosecution, or to extradite that person. In addition, it is now widely recognized that states, even those that are not states parties to these treaties, may exercise universal jurisdiction over torture under customary international law.&lt;ref name=AI-UJ&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior53/012/2001/en/?OpenDocument Universal Jurisdiction: The duty of states to enact and implement legislation – Chapter Nine (Torture: The legal basis for universal jurisdiction)], [[Amnesty International]] 1 September 2001. Section II. Universal Jurisdiction over torture &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Examples of particular states invoking universal jurisdiction are Israel's prosecution of Eichmann in 1961 (see {{section link||Israel}} below) and Spain's prosecution of South American dictators and torturers (see {{section link||Spain}} below).  More recently, the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] tried first in Switzerland and then in Canada to prosecute former US President [[George W. Bush]] on behalf of persons tortured in US detention camps, invoking the universal jurisdiction doctrine. Bush cancelled his trip to Switzerland after news of the planned prosecution came to light. Bush has traveled to Canada but the Canadian government shut down the prosecution in advance of his arrest.&lt;ref name = "Center Prosecution"&gt;{{cite news |author=Matt Eisenbrandt |author2=Katherine Gallagher |title=Halting Canadian Bush Prosecution Violated International Obligations|url=http://jurist.org/hotline/2012/01/eisenbrandt-gallagher-bush.php |work=[[Jurist]] | quote=Canada disregarded an opportunity to shatter the global impunity Bush enjoys and in so doing violated international law. |date=January 17, 2012  |accessdate=2016-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center has filed a grievance with the United Nations for Canada's failure to invoke universal jurisdiction to enforce the [[Convention Against Torture]], a petition on which action is pending.&lt;ref name = "Center Prosecution"/&gt;

==Immunity for state officials==
On 14 February 2002, the International Court of Justice in the [[Case Concerning the Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)|''ICJ Arrest Warrant Case'']] concluded that state officials may have immunity under international law while serving in office. The court stated that immunity was not granted to state officials for their own benefit, but instead to ensure the effective performance of their functions on behalf of their respective states. The court also stated that when abroad, state officials may enjoy immunity from arrest in another state on criminal charges, including charges of war crimes or crimes against humanity.&lt;ref name=ICJ-PR-020214&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2002/afr379.html|title=ICJ rejects Belgian arrest warrant for foreign ministers of Democratic Republic of Congo|publisher=United Nations Information Service|date=14 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the ICJ qualified its conclusions, saying that state officers "may be subject to criminal proceedings before certain international criminal courts, where they have jurisdiction. Examples include the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda&amp;nbsp;..., and the future International Criminal Court."&lt;ref name=CRAN-2003-fn6&gt;Cesare P.R.

Cites in footnote 6: Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium), Judgment, Merits, para. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Charles G. Taylor|Charles Taylor]], the former president of [[Liberia]], was served with an arrest warrant by the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] (SCSL) that was set up under the auspices of a treaty that binds only the United Nations and the Government of Sierra Leone.&lt;ref name=CRAN-2003&gt;Cesare P.R. Romano and André Nollkaemper. ''[http://www.asil.org/insights/insigh110.htm The Arrest Warrant Against The Liberian President, Charles Taylor]'', on the website of the [[American Society of International Law]], June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor contested the Special Court's jurisdiction, claiming immunity, but the Special Court for Sierra Leone concluded in 2004 that "the sovereign equality of states does not prevent a head of state from being prosecuted before an international criminal tribunal or court".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sc-sl.org/CASES/ProsecutorvsCharlesTaylor/tabid/107/Default.aspx&lt; |title=Prosecutor v.

David |lastauthoramp=yes |date=31 May 2004 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, the question whether a former head of state might have immunity depends on which international court or tribunal endeavors to try him, how the court is constituted, and how it interprets its own mandate.

===Australia===

The High Court of Australia confirmed the authority of the Australian Parliament, under the Australian Constitution, to exercise universal jurisdiction over war crimes in the ''[[Polyukhovich v Commonwealth]]'' case of 1991.

===Belgium===
In 1993, Belgium's Parliament passed a "law of universal jurisdiction" (sometimes referred to as "Belgium's genocide law"), allowing it to judge people accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. In 2001, four Rwandan citizens were convicted and given sentences from 12 to 20 years' imprisonment for their involvement in 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/french/press/2003/justice02.htm |title=Belgique : Questions et Réponses sur la loi de Compétence Universelle |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a rapid succession of cases:
*Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] was accused of involvement in the 1982 [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] in Lebanon, conducted by a Christian militia;
*Israelis filed a case against [[Yasser Arafat]] on grounds of responsibility for terrorist activity;
*In 2003, Iraqi victims of a [[Gulf War|1991 Bagdad bombing]] pressed charges against [[George Herbert Walker Bush|George H.W. Bush]], [[Colin Powell]] and [[Dick Cheney]].

Confronted with this sharp increase in cases, Belgium established the condition that the accused person must be Belgian or present in Belgium. An arrest warrant issued in 2000 under this law, against the then Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was challenged before the [[International Court of Justice]] in the case entitled ''[[Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)|ICJ Arrest Warrant Case]]''. The ICJ's decision issued on 14 February 2002 found that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the question of universal jurisdiction, instead deciding the question on the basis of immunity of high-ranking state officials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061002112703/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/iCOBE/icobejudgment/icobe_ijudgment_20020214.PDF ICJ's decision] See paragraph 43&lt;/ref&gt; However, the matter was addressed in separate and dissenting opinions,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070313044438/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/iCOBE/iCOBEframe.htm separate and dissenting opinions]&lt;/ref&gt; such as that of President Guillaume who concluded that universal jurisdiction exists only in relation to piracy;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/121/8128.pdf separate opinion of President Guillaume] at paragraph 12&lt;/ref&gt; and the dissenting opinion of Judge Oda who recognised piracy, hijacking, terrorism and genocide as crimes subject to universal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020312003750/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/iCOBE/icobejudgment/icobe_ijudgment_20020214_oda.PDF dissenting opinion of Judge Oda], paragraph 12&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2003, Belgium repealed the law on universal jurisdiction, and introduced a new law on [[extraterritorial jurisdiction]] similar to or more restrictive than that of most other European countries. However, some cases that had already started continued. These included those concerning the Rwandan genocide, and complaints filed against the Chadian ex-President [[Hissène Habré]] (dubbed the "African [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/press/2003/08/belgium080103.htm|title=Belgium: Universal Jurisdiction Law Repealed|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=1 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2005, Habré was indicted for crimes against humanity, torture, war crimes and other human rights violations by a Belgian court. Arrested in [[Senegal]] following requests from Senegalese courts, he was tried and convicted for war crimes by the Special Tribunal in Senegal in 2016 and sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trial-ch.org/fr/trial-watch/profil/db/facts/hissene_habre_87.html Trial Watch : Hissène Habré] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413081352/http://www.trial-ch.org/fr/trial-watch/profil/db/facts/hissene_habre_87.html |date=13 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

To implement the Rome Statute, Canada passed the [[Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act]]. [[Michael Byers (Canadian author)|Michael Byers]], a [[University of British Columbia]] law professor, has argued that these laws go further than the Rome Statute, providing Canadian courts with jurisdiction over acts pre-dating the ICC and occurring in territories outside of ICC member-states; "as a result, anyone who is present in Canada and alleged to have committed genocide, torture ... anywhere, at any time, can be prosecuted [in Canada]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Byers|title=Intent for a Nation|year=2007 |publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-1-55365-250-2|page=111 |authorlink=Michael Byers (Canadian author)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===

A Finnish high court sentenced a Rwandan preacher to life in jail in 2010 for his participation in Rwanda's genocide in 1994. Francois Bazaramba, 59, moved in 2003 to Finland seeking asylum. Finland allows prosecutions for crimes against humanity wherever they are committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10294529 | work=BBC News | title=Finland sentences Rwanda preacher to life for genocide | date=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the genocide, he was a pastor in the Baptist church in Nyakizu in southern Rwanda. According to Finnish newspaper ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'', the court found him guilty of orchestrating deadly attacks, and organising the torching of Tutsi homes. In a statement the court said he had spread anti-Tutsi propaganda and incited "killings through fomenting anger and contempt towards Tutsis". It stated that "The court has found Bazaramba guilty of an offence which without a genocidal intent would be judged as a murder or incitement to murder ... For those crimes, the only possible punishment is life imprisonment." ''Helsingin Sanomat'' reported that he was acquitted of 10 counts of murder and of providing training and acquiring weapons.

===Germany===
{{Main|Völkerstrafgesetzbuch}}

Germany has implemented the principle of universal jurisdiction for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes into its criminal law through the "'''''Völkerstrafgesetzbuch"''''' or '''''VStGB''''' ("international criminal code", literally "book of the criminal law of peoples"), which implemented the treaty creating the [[International Criminal Court]] into domestic law. The law was passed in 2002 and up to 2014 it has been used once, in the trial of [[Rwanda]]n rebel leader [[Ignace Murwanashyaka]]. In 2015 he was found guilty and sentenced to 13 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://armedgroups-internationallaw.org/2015/09/28/conviction-of-fdlr-leaders-by-german-court/ | title=Conviction of FDLR leaders by German Court | work= Armed Groups and International Law | date=28 September 2015 | accessdate=2015-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/05/us-tells-armed-group-drc-surrender-military-option|title = US tells armed group in DRC to surrender or face 'military option'|date = 5 Aug 2014|work = |accessdate = 19 Nov 2014|publisher = The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Adolf Eichmann}}
The [[moral philosophy|moral philosopher]] [[Peter Singer]], along with Kenneth Roth,&lt;ref name=KR-2001/&gt; has cited [[Israel]]'s prosecution of [[Adolf Eichmann]] in 1961 as an assertion of universal jurisdiction. He claims that while Israel did invoke a statute specific to [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] crimes against Jews, its [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] claimed universal jurisdiction over crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Singer |title=One World |year=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=114 |isbn=0-300-09686-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eichmann's defense lawyer argued that Israel did not have jurisdiction on account of Israel not having come into existence until 1948. The Genocide Convention also did not come into effect until 1951, and the Genocide Convention does not automatically provide for universal jurisdiction. It is also argued that Israeli agents obtained Eichmann illegally, violating international law when they seized and kidnapped Eichmann, and brought him to Israel to stand trial. The Argentinian government settled the dispute diplomatically with Israel.&lt;ref name = EichmannTrial&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Attorney General of Israel v. Eichmann |vol=Criminal Case 40/61 |reporter= |court=District Court of Jerusalem |date=1961 |url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ }} {{citation|title=Transcripts |accessdate=6 February 2013 |url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ |  archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20061001235018/http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ |archivedate = 1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel argued universal jurisdiction based on the "universal character of the crimes in question" and that the crimes committed by Eichmann were not only in violation of Israel law, but were considered "grave offenses against the law of nations itself".&lt;ref name = EichmannTrial/&gt; It also asserted that the crime of genocide is covered under international customary law. As a supplemental form of jurisdiction, a further argument is made on the basis of protective jurisdiction. Protective jurisdiction is a principle that "provides that states may exercise jurisdiction over aliens who have committed an act abroad which is deemed prejudicial to the security of the particular state concerned".&lt;ref name = EichmannTrial/&gt;

In November 2011, the [[Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission]] purportedly exercised universal jurisdiction to [[trial in absentia|try and convict ''in absentia'']] former US President [[George W.

===Senegal===

In July 2015, the first trial in Africa of a universal jurisdiction case relating to crimes committed abroad by a foreigner with foreign victims was held in a Senegalese courtroom. The former dictator of [[Chad]], [[Hissène Habré]], denied the legitimacy of the special court set up to try him in Senegal for the deaths of thousands during his rule, but the head of the tribunal, [[Gberdao Gustave Kam]], said he would be compelled to participate.  Mr. Habré's lawyers said he was forced to attend the first day of his trial for crimes against humanity, war crimes and torture. The case was lauded by [[Human Rights Watch]]. It was also the first time the courts of one country are prosecuting the former ruler of another for alleged human rights crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/ex-dictator-of-chad-denies-legitimacy-of-torture-crimes-trial-in-senegal/article25599568/ theglobeandmail.com: "Ex-dictator of Chad denies legitimacy of torture crimes trial in Senegal"], 20 Jul 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===

Spanish law recognizes the principle of universal jurisdiction. Article 23.4 of the Judicial Power Organization Act (LOPJ), enacted on 1 July 1985, establishes that Spanish courts have jurisdiction over crimes committed by Spaniards or foreign citizens outside Spain when such crimes can be described according to Spanish criminal law as genocide, terrorism, or some other, as well as any other crime that, according to international treaties or conventions, must be prosecuted in Spain. On 25 July 2009, the Spanish Congress passed a law that limits the competence of the [[Audiencia Nacional of Spain|Audiencia Nacional]] under Article 23.4 to cases in which Spaniards are victims, there is a relevant link to Spain, or the alleged perpetrators are in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spain reins in crusading judges |publisher=BBC News | date=25 June 2009 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8119920.stm |first=Steve |last=Kingstone}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law still has to pass the Senate, the high chamber, but passage is expected because it is supported by both major parties.&lt;ref name="The Associated Press"&gt;{{cite news | title=Spanish court ends Israel bombing probe | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g7nVX6JkK9c3ofnkBpgD_5eFF84AD9950VPO0 | agency=Associated Press | date=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, [[Nobel peace prize]] winner [[Rigoberta Menchú]] brought a case against the [[Guatemala]]n military leadership in a Spanish Court.

On 11 January 2006, the [[Audiencia Nacional|Spanish High Court]] agreed to investigate a case in which seven former Chinese officials, including the former [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|Communist Party General Secretary]] [[Jiang Zemin]] and former [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Li Peng]] were alleged to have participated in a genocide in [[Tibet]].

===United States===
While the United States has no formal statute authorizing it, in some cases the Federal government has exercised [[self-help (law)|self-help]] in apprehending or killing persons suspected of conspiring to commit crimes within the United States from outside of the country, or committing crimes against U.S officials outside of the United States. This has occurred even when the suspect is not a U.S. person, has never been in the United States, and even when the person has never conspired or assisted in the commission of a crime within the United States, there is a functioning government which could try the person for the crime committed there, and notwithstanding the existence of a proper extradition treaty between that country and the United States, ignoring the provisions of the treaty and capturing or killing the person directly.

In 1985, Dr. Humberto Alvarez-Machain, a [[Mexico|Mexican]] national, allegedly assisted in the torture and murder of a U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent in Mexico. Notwithstanding that the U.S had an extradition treaty with Mexico (and because the Mexican government declined to extradite a Mexican national to the U.S. for a crime allegedly committed in Mexico), the U.S. Government hired a private citizen and some Mexican nationals to essentially act as mercenaries, who then went into Mexico, kidnapped Dr. Alvarez-Machain, and brought him back to the U.S. for trial for the crime committed in Mexico. The trial court ruled that since Alvarez-Machain had been brought to the U.S. in violation of the treaty, his arrest was unlawful. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], in ''[[United States v. Alvarez-Machain]]'', ruled that notwithstanding the existence of an extradition treaty with Mexico, it was still legal for the U.S. government to exercise self-help and essentially grab him off the street in Mexico ("forcible abduction") to bring him back to the U.S. for trial. In Alvarez-Machain's subsequent criminal trial, he was acquitted, and he lost a civil suit he filed for false arrest against the government.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Foundation===
[[File:John Ward by Thomas Beech.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Ward (actor)|John Ward]]]]The Warwickshire Company of Comedians was founded by [[John Ward (actor)|John Ward]] at Birmingham's [[Moor Street Theatre]], which opened in 1740 and which Ward is recorded as managing in the early 1740s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Pendleton|first=Muriel|year=2010|title=From bullbaiting to theater and oratorio attending: The cultural development of Birmingham during the eighteenth century|publication-place=Long Beach, CA|publisher=California State University|pp=38–39|url=http://gradworks.umi.com/14/86/1486356.html|accessdate=2011-05-23}} ; {{Harvnb|Thompson|1999|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the precise date of its foundation is unknown, the company was definitely in existence by 1744, when they are recorded as visiting [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|1999|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their burgeoning reputation was apparent by the time of their next visit in May 1746, when a surviving letter from a local schoolmaster described them as "a Company of Strolling-Players ... much ye best Set I have seen out of London, &amp; in which opinion I am far from being singular".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McManaway|1949|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company returned to Stratford again later that year, when their performance of ''[[Othello]]'' on 9 September – raising money to restore the memorial bust of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] in [[Church of the Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon|Holy Trinity Church]] – was the earliest recorded performance of a play by Shakespeare in the playwright's home town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Highfill|Burnim|Langhans||1993|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following decades the company toured widely, performing in town halls, barns, schoolhouses and guildhalls throughout the [[English Midlands]] and [[Wales]].&lt;ref name="Thompson 1999 143"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|1999|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their reputation was such that they were able to play long seasons at each venue – 23 weeks at [[Ludlow]] in 1758 and seventeen weeks at [[Brecon]] in 1764&lt;ref name="Thompson 1999 143"/&gt; – and their repertoire was wide: as well as [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] it included works by [[William Congreve|Congreve]], [[John Dryden|Dryden]], [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Rowe]], [[Nathaniel Lee|Lee]], [[Richard Steele|Steele]] and [[John Vanbrugh|Vanbrugh]], and extended to [[pantomime]], [[music]] and [[dance]].&lt;ref name="McManaway 1949 307"&gt;{{Harvnb|McManaway|1949|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their performances also had a keen sense of spectacle: in [[Hereford]] in 1753 they presented ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' with the "Grand Funeral Procession and Solemn Dirge set to Music by Signor Pasqualli",&lt;ref name="McManaway 1949 307"/&gt; and at [[Gloucester]] in 1747 they performed ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'' "with the whole ceremony of the coronation of Queen Anne Bullen and the military ceremony of the Champion (on horse-back) in Westminster Hall. The Robes, Armour, Canopy and Bishops' and Judges' dresses and all the decorations of the play entirely new".&lt;ref name="Highfill 1993 261"&gt;{{Harvnb|Highfill|Burnim|Langhans||1993|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kemble===
[[File:Harlow The Court for the Trial of Queen Katharine.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the [[Kemble family]], including [[Sarah Siddons]] and [[John Philip Kemble]], performing at the [[Royal Opera House|Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]] in 1806]]The major turning point in the company's existence took place in 1751 when [[Richard Yates (actor)|Richard Yates]]' company from London's [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] opened the purpose-built [[King Street Theatre]] in Birmingham to compete with the smaller venue in Moor Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Price|first=Victor J.|year=1988|title=Birmingham theatres: concert and music halls, 1740-1988|publication-place=Studley|publisher=Brewin Books|page=1|isbn=0-947731-35-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ward's reaction to this invasion of his long-held territory was ill-tempered – the contemporary actor [[Charles Lee Lewes]] records him describing the newcomers as "drawling, face-making puppies" and promising to "work the dogs a penn'orth for daring to cross my circuit"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Lewes|first1=Charles Lee|year=1805|title=Memoirs of Charles Lee Lewes: containing anecdotes, historical and biographical, of the English and Scottish stages, during a period of forty years|volume=1|publication-place=London|publisher=Richard Phillips|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gM5MAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA89|accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and Ward responded by advertising in the London newspapers for "capital performers" to join him in Birmingham.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1999 143"/&gt; This was pivotal moment in theatrical history, as it was this advertisement that brought [[Roger Kemble]] to Birmingham to join the company, and the following June in [[Cirencester]] Kemble married the Wards' daughter Sarah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McManaway|1949|pp=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the couple's twelve children each that survived into adulthood went onto the stage, all except one married performers, and all were to start their careers performing with the Warwickshire Company of Comedians: this marked the origin of the [[Kemble family]], who were to dominate the English stage over the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Highfill|Burnim|Langhans||1982|pp=390–391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several sources relate the Wards' anger at their daughter Sarah's elopement: she was not yet 16 and although a "main prop" of her father's in the "comic province", they felt that "an actor's existence was the last into which they wished her to drift".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McManaway|1949|pp=305–306}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kembles were readmitted into the company, however, with Ward justifying his "sullen forgiveness" in the light of his low opinion of his new son-in-law's talents, telling his daughter "I forbade you to marry an actor. You have not disobeyed me since the man you have married neither is nor ever can be an actor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McManaway|1949|p=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Kembles left the company and toured independently between 1761 and 1763, the Wards retired to [[Leominster]] in 1766 and Roger Kemble took over its management on 24 May of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Highfill|Burnim|Langhans||1982|p=389}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the company appeared at [[Worcester]] in 1767 they were described as "Mr Kemble's Company of Comedians", with the cast featuring the Kembles' 14-year-old daughter Sarah – the future [[Sarah Siddons]] – and their 12-year-old son [[John Philip Kemble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Price|1948|p=42}}; {{Harvnb|Highfill|Burnim|Langhans||1982|p=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kemble retired in 1781 and the company's stock and goodwill was split between two of the company's members: [[John Boles Watson]], who formed the "Cheltenham Company of Comedians" and established it as the resident company at his newly built [[Theatre Royal, Cheltenham|Cheltenham Playhouse]], and [[Henry Masterman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Denning|first1=Anthony|last2=Ranger|first2=Paul|year=1993|title=Theatre in the Cotswolds|publication-place=London|publisher=Society for Theatre Research|pages=1–2|isbn=0-85430-054-6}}; {{Harvnb|Price|1948|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation and legacy==
The growth of the reputation of the Warwickshire Company of Comedians marked the birth of Birmingham's theatrical tradition, which was well established by 1750,&lt;ref name="Money" /&gt; and further extended this influence to the surrounding counties – they "made the temporary theatre in barn, hall or inn the centre of polite provincial life and brought London tastes and diversions to the country towns".&lt;ref name="Highfill 1993 261"/&gt; 

Under Ward the company's performances were of a much higher standard than that typical of [[strolling players]], being more comparable to those of the major [[London]] companies, with whom Ward and several of his company had considerable experience and with whose development they maintained a lively interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Price|1948|pp=39–41, 42}}; {{Harvnb|McManaway|1949|pp=299, 304}}; {{Harvnb|Highfill|Burnim|Langhans||1993|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high regard in which the company was held was recorded by the contemporary actor [[Charles Lee Lewes]], whose memoirs describe the "Great Ward" and his "very great company at Birmingham: many of them are no less than Londoners".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Lewes|first1=Charles Lee|year=1805|title=Memoirs of Charles Lee Lewes: containing anecdotes, historical and biographical, of the English and Scottish stages, during a period of forty years|volume=2|publication-place=London|publisher=Richard Phillips|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=glAOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA130|accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Holcroft]], who acted with the company in the 1770s, recalled that in Kemble's time too it was "more respectable than many other companies of strolling players".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Holcroft|first1=Thomas|publication-date=1856|year=1810|title=Memoirs of the late Thomas Holcroft: written by himself; and continued to the time of his death|volume=17|series=The Traveller's Library|publication-place=London|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green and Longmans|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ksXVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA81|accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The principle importance of the company, however, lies in its role in the genesis of the [[Kemble family]], who were generally thought to have received their beauty and talent from the Wards and whose emergence saw actors with provincial origins for the first time leading rather than following the London stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Highfill|Burnim|Langhans||1993|p=261}}; {{Harvnb|McManaway|1949|p=309}}; {{Harvnb|Thomson|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annotations from Ward's surviving [[prompt book]]s show that he was familiar with [[early texts of Shakespeare's works]] and was restoring Shakespeare's original text at an earlier date and more comprehensively even than [[David Garrick]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McManaway|1949|pp=313–314}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also suggest that changes to the staging of ''[[Hamlet]]'' introduced to London as innovations by John Phillip Kemble had been practiced by Ward's company as early as 1740.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|1999|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; While tradition has it that Sarah Siddons "learnt her trade" between her initial unsuccessful appearance at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] in 1775 and her triumphant return in 1782, it is equally possible that it was popular taste in London that had caught up in the meantime with her style, which was more suited to the emerging [[romanticism]] than the existing fashionable [[neoclassicism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Trussler|first=Simon|publication-date=2000|year=1994|title=The Cambridge illustrated history of British theatre|publication-place=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=206|isbn=0-521-41913-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
