'''Balwant Pandurang Kirloskar''' ([[Devanagari]]: बळवंत पांडुरंग किर्लोस्कर) (31 March 1843 − 2 November 1885), popularly known as '''Annasaheb Kirloskar''', was a [[Marathi language|Marathi]] playwright from [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].

Kirloskar was born on March 31, 1843 at [[Gurlhosur]] in [[Belgaum district]] to a [[Karhade]] Brahmin family.
After completing schooling in his native place, at the age of twenty, Annasaheb moved to [[Pune]] to pursue further education. His overwhelming interest, however, lay in theatre and he faced parental pressure for his continued disinterest in formal education. His father pressurised him to return to his native [[Belgaum]].

To support himself, Kirloskar then worked for eight years as a school teacher in [[Belgaum]];  he subsequently worked for a few years in the police department and then as a clerk in the revenue commissioner's office. Despite his lack of much formal education, Kirloskar was well-versed in [[Sanskrit]] literature.

==Marathi theater history==
In 1843, the same year in which Kirloskar's was born, [[Vishnudas Bhave]] pioneered presentation of [[Marathi language|Marathi]] plays by staging the play ''Seeta Swayamwar'' (सीतास्वयंवर), the [[Raja]] of the princely state of [[Sangli]] being then in attendance among the audience.

While working as a school teacher in Belgaum, Kirloskar established ''Bharatshastrottejak Mandali'' (भरतशास्त्रोत्तेजक मंडळी) in 1866. Seven years later, he completed composition of his first prose play ''Shri Shankar Digvijay'' (श्रीशांकर दिग्विजय) for public presentation by ''Kolhapurkar Natak Mandali'' (कोल्हापूर नाटक मंडळी). Around 1874, he founded ''Kirloskar Natak Mandali'' (किर्लोस्कर नाटक मंडळी).

In 1879, playwright and producer Trilokekar independently presented his musical play ''Nal-Damayanti'' (नल-दमयंती) to Marathi public. It was the first musical play on Marathi stage.

===Shakuntal===
Kirloskar felt inspired to produce a similar musical play in Marathi in a full-fledged manner. Accordingly, translating into Marathi the first four acts of [[Kālidāsa|Kalidas]]'s renowned [[Sanskrit]] play ''Abhidnyan Shakuntalam'' or "Abhijñānashākuntala" (अभिज्ञानशाकुंतलं), he presented them on stage in 1880 as a musical play titled ''Shakuntal'' (शाकुंतल).

The next year, he translated the remaining three acts of ''Abhidnyan Shakuntalam'' and staged the entire play. He performed in the play himself.

Kirloskar incredibly included 198 musical pieces in his Marathi ''Shakuntal''. They consisted of a mix of [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] and [[Carnatic classical music]], and lighter music.

===Saubhadra===
One year later, in 1882, Kirloskar presented on stage his musical ''Saubhadra'' (सौभद्र). This play too contained well over 100 musical pieces, and once again he acted in the play.

Because of its multifaceted quality, ''Saubhadra'' surpassed even the high popularity of ''Shakuntal''. Innumerable performances of these two plays have been presented by different performing groups to the Marathi audience since their premiere 130 years ago.

===Ram Rajya Wiyog===
In 1884, Kirloskar presented to the audience the first three acts of his musical ''Ram Rajya Wiyog''. Before he could finish writing the planned remaining three acts of this play, he died in 02 NOVEMBAR 1885 at age 42.

==Marathi theater companies==
''Kirloskar Natak Mandali'' founded by Anna Saheb in 1880 was the pioneer and breakthrough performing company in Marathi theater.&lt;ref&gt;India's Shakespeare: Translation, Interpretation, and Performance edited by Poonam Trivedi And Dennis Bartholomeusz, Poonam Trivedi(2005) pp:50&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the prime performing company in Marathi language until 1913. After Kirloskar's death, it presented  plays of [[Govind Ballal Deval]] and Shripad Krushna   Kolhatkar besides Kirloskar's ''Shakuntal'' and ''Saubhadra''. It toured through  [[Maharashtra]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Maratha]] princely states in North India under the [[British Raj]] at that time - [[Indore]], [[Baroda]], [[Gwalior]] etc.The ''Mandali'' had several star singer-actors in its employ, including [[Bal Gandharva]], Govindrao Tembe, Master Krushnarao, and [[Ganesh Bodas]].

''Kirloskar Natak Mandali'' folded around 1935.

[[Bal Gandharva]]'s ''Gandharva Natak Mandali''; Vasudeorao Dongre's ''Dongre Mandali''; Pandoba Gurav Yavateshwarkar's ''Waikar Sangeet Mandali'';  Janubhau Nimkar and Keshavrao Bhosale's ''Swadesh-Hita-Chintak Mandali'', which evolved into ''Lalit-Kaladarsha Mandali''; and Master Dinanath's ''Balwant Natak Mandali'' were the other main performing companies which were formed in Maharashtra after 1913.

'''Babm''' (pronounced {{IPA-art|bɔˈɑːbɔmu|}}) is an [[international auxiliary language]] created by the Japanese philosopher Rikichi [Fuishiki] Okamoto (1885–1963). Okamoto first published the language in his 1962 book, The Simplest Universal Auxiliary Language Babm,&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3PBYAAAAMAAJ|title=Universal auxiliary language, Babm|author=Okamoto|first=Fuishiki|date=1962|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=Tokyo|pages=|accessdate=2014-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the language has not caught on even within the [[constructed language]] community, and does not have any known current speakers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uweb.ucsb.edu/~jwieser/IALattempts.htm&lt;/ref&gt;The language uses the [[Latin script]] as a [[syllabary]], and possesses no [[Article (grammar)|articles]] or [[Auxiliary verb|auxiliary verbs]]. Each letter marks an entire [[syllable]] rather than a single [[phoneme]]. Babm follows a sound-based rule set, which Okamoto outlines in his book. He states "Nouns are coined from three consonants and one vowel, verbs from one or two vowels between two consonants at the beginning and at the end. Adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, numerals, and propositions have respectively their own peculiar form." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=(The Simplest) Universal Auxiliary Language BABM|last=Okamoto|first=Fuishiki|publisher=Fuishiki Okamoto|year=1962|isbn=|location=Tokyo, Japan|pages=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The language has in common with some 17th-century artificial languages an over-riding concern with [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]], and providing a universally consistent set of names for chemicals, etc.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://a-bas-le-ciel.blogspot.ca/2012/05/babm-japans-inspiring-answer-to.html |title=à bas le ciel: BABM: Japan's (inspiring?) answer to Esperanto |publisher=A-bas-le-ciel.blogspot.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; the author's "scientific" preoccupation is a contrast to the socio-political mandate of [[Esperanto]], although the 1962 book is certainly not lacking in statements about world peace. Okamoto hoped this "simple" language would become universally useful. 

== Phonology ==
Every consonant in Babm must be followed by a particular short vowel, with the exception of /k/ which can be followed by any vowel. Vowels that are attached to nouns are short vowels by default, and those not attached to nouns are long, but vowel length can be modified. Because of this, words have a basic CV structure with some vowel clusters but no consonant clusters.&lt;ref name="google" /&gt;

== Syntax ==
Okamoto provides limited information about the syntax, stating that "it is rather desirable that it [the sentence] be free from many rules of composition." The [[word order]] is [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]], with [[Grammatical modifier|modifiers]] preceding the elements they modify.&lt;ref name="google" /&gt;

The language exhibits some degree of [[Isolating language|analytic]] [[inflection]]: In sentences with complex structures, the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], the [[direct object]], and the [[indirect object]] can be distinguished through preceding "prepositional conjunctions." There is also a set of auxiliary-like elements that Okamoto terms "executive complements," which modify the verb in various ways and may occur either as suffixes or as separate words preceding the verb.&lt;ref name="google" /&gt;

== Semantics ==
Okamoto's book provides a detailed dictionary, split up into a number of sections. In his text, Okamoto splits nouns up into nine sections: "Living Things", "Material Bodies", "Chemical Terms", "Expendables and Materials", "Durable Goods", "Human Body and Physiology", ""Conscious Actions", "Structure of Living", and "Politics". Each of these sections is split into a number of sub-sections. The other parts of speech further split into smaller sections in the book are Verbs, Complements and Prepositional Conjunctions. Okamoto also includes a section for "Abridged Common Expressions" such as "Good evening!" and "Congratulations!" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Morphology ==
In order to keep the language simple, Babm does not have articles or auxiliary verbs, and avoids the inflection of a basic word.&lt;ref name="google" /&gt;

=== Nouns ===
As a rule, 4 letters make up a noun. Nouns have an initial short-sound letter which indicates meaning, usually followed by a long-sound letter which is pronounced long and with a strong accent. The third letter is also usually short-sound, and it indicates the sort of noun divided by meaning, although it can be long-sound as well. The final letter is also short-sound, and it specifies the noun. If a noun has two long-sound letters in the middle, the first is accentuated. Proper nouns should follow these guidelines, however one long-sound or one short-sound letter may be added before or after the word. ''c, lr,'' and ''qw'' are not permitted to be noun-initial, and ''l'' and ''w'' are avoided at the end of nouns. 

Example nouns include ''babm'' (a universal language) and ''rboit'' (mother and father).

=== Verbs ===
Verbs have either 3 or 4 letters. They must start with a short-sound letter which indicates meaning and end with a short-sound letter. There can be one or two long-sound letters in the middle. One long-sound letter and the final short-sound letter correspond with their similar-sounding noun counterpart. On rare occasions, verbs may have three long-sound letters. The first long-sound letter and the third long-sound letter (if present) are accentually pronounced and the final short-sound letter is pronounced slightly strongly and distinctly. 

Example: ''bean''

=== Complements ===
Complements have less than three letters and are conducted by ''c''. The complement is an adjective when modifying a noun or pronoun and an adverb when qualifying any other word. The suffix ''-w'' may also be added to adverbs to make it clearer. They generally end with a short-sound letter. ''l'' and ''w'' are avoided at the end of complements. Example: cefd (white)

=== Pronouns ===
Pronouns have four classes: personal pronoun, impersonal pronoun, relative pronoun, and interrogative pronoun. 

Personal and impersonal pronouns:
{| class="wikitable"
|+
!First person
!Second person
!Third person
!Impersonal
|-
|''V-'' I

''va-'' we

''ov'' - I (male)

''ova -'' we (male)

''iv -'' I (female)

''iva'' - we (female)
|''Y'' - you (singular)

''ya -'' you (plural)

''oy'' - you (male)

''oya -'' you (plural)

''iy''- you (female)

''iya'' - you (plural) 
|''x -'' he or she

''xa -'' they

''ox'' - he

''oxa'' - they (male)

''ix -'' she

''ixa -'' they (female)
|''z'' - an object

''za -'' objects

''ez'' - that object

''eza -'' those objects

''iz'' - this object 

''iza -'' these objects
|}

Relative pronouns are based on ''lr'', and interrogative pronouns are based on ''qw.'' Both of these are used as the subject or object. The beginning short-sound letter and the first long-sound letter are accented, and other long-sound letters are pronounced somewhat strongly and distinctly with a pause.

=== Prepositional conjunctions ===
The prepositional conjunction is one letter, ''a''. It usually accompanies one or two long-sound letters before or after one short-sound letter and may be placed before any word, clause, or sentence. 

=== Exclamations ===
Exclamations are two long-sounding letters and ''w'' may be added to the middle or end. 

=== Affixes ===
Babm utilizes prefixes and suffixes to modify nouns, verbs, complements, and pronouns. 

== Writing&lt;ref name="google" /&gt; ==
Babm uses the Latin alphabet with 26 letters. Each letter of the alphabet represents said letter plus a short vowel. Written vowels represent long vowels. The consonant and vowel inventories are as follows:

'''Baltix''' is an [[operating system]] for Lithuanian and Latvian people, based on [[Debian]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]].&lt;ref name="Official Baltix website in English"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://baltix.akl.lt/english |title=Official Baltix website in English |access-date=2008-04-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403072222/http://baltix.akl.lt/english |archive-date=2008-04-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main language is [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]].

It uses the [[GNOME]] desktop environment (also [[Unity (user interface)|Ubuntu Unity]] user interface is included since 2011) and is distributed as an installable [[Live CD]].

The first public versions of Baltix were released in 2003 and were based on [[Knoppix]] [[Live CD]] and [[Debian]] software packages,&lt;ref&gt;[https://lists.akl.lt/pipermail/baltix-knoppix/2003-May/000000.html Announce of Baltix-Knoppix]&lt;/ref&gt; and later, on the [[Morphix]] Live CD framework.  Most recently, [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] technology was chosen for Live CD. Despite of changes in startup and installation technologies, Baltix is always distributed as an installable Live CD with graphical installer.&lt;ref name="Baltix on Ubuntu derivative Wiki"&gt;[http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Baltix Baltix description on official Ubuntu derivative Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007 separate Baltix CD/DVD images for home/business use, educational institutions (DVD version for "Science and Education"&lt;ref&gt;[http://mokslui.akl.lt Free software for Education and Science]&lt;/ref&gt;) and servers are being released.

Baltix can run directly from its live-CD, without installation to a computer's permanent storage (hard disk, solid state drive, etc.), but also can be installed into a computer's Linux or Windows partition(s).

== Additional software ==
Baltix has software packages not included in default [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] CD/DVD images:

* Educational software for kids and adults, including [[GCompris]], [[TuxPaint]], [[Atomix (GNOME game)|Atomix]], etc.
* Parental Control and Content Filtering software [[GNOME Nanny]], [[Dansguardian|Dansguardian-GUI]]
* Possibility to run software, compiled for Windows OS [[Wine (software)]]
* Vector graphic, [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] and diagram drawing software, including [[Inkscape]], [[QCAD]] and [[Dia (software)|Dia]]

== Goals ==
* Easy and right away ready for majority of Lithuanian, Latvian and Russian home/office users (no need to install additionally software for multimedia support or office work, e.g. spelling dictionaries or templates)
* Ability to run software, compiled for Windows OS
* Possibility to work comfortable on older computers (starting from 128MB RAM and 700Mhz CPU), little resources consuming desktop environment is included (currently [[LXDE]])
* Comfortable for computer manufacturers (Baltix 1.x, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014) have a noninteractive automatic installation (autoinstall) feature - OS can be installed into computer in about 10 minutes without user intervention.&lt;ref name="Baltix on Ubuntu derivative Wiki"/&gt;

'''Bantenese language''', '''Western Sundanese language''' or '''Western Sundanese dialect''' is a dialect of [[Sundanese language]] spoken by the [[Bantenese people|Bantenese]] and [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] native to Banten and the western side of [[Bogor Regency]]. The western Bogor area comprises the Jasinga Raya region, which covers Jasinga,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://heibogorcom.wordpress.com/2015/09/04/jasinga-bagian-bogor-yang-banten-secara-kultural/ |title=Jasinga, Bagian Bogor yang Banten Secara Kultural |author= |publisher=HEIBOGOR |date=4 September 2015 |accessdate=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cigudeg, Tenjo, Nanggung, Parungpanjang, Sukujaya subdistrict&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kecamatanjasinga.bogorkab.go.id/index.php/multisite/post/3620/asal-usul-nama-jasinga#.WW2TloSGOM9 |title=Asal Usul Nama Jasinga |author=Kalakay Jasinga |publisher=Kecamatan Jasinga Kabupaten Bogor |date=25 April 2016 |accessdate=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also the northwestern parts of [[Sukabumi Regency]]. The Bantenese language is the [[lingua franca]] of the ''Kasepuhan Ciptagelar'' traditional community in Cisolok subdistrict, and the ''Kasepuhan Banten Kidul'' traditional community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0NkADi2dc |title=KASEPUHAN CIPTAGELAR (full movie) |author=Watchdoc Image |publisher=YouTube |date=29 November 2015 |accessdate=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regional government of Banten is currently making a significant approach to preserve this dialect through a news program entitled ''Beja ti Lembur'', which was aired by the regional CTV Banten network in Bantenese language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bantenprov.go.id/upload/Konten%20statis/WARISAN%20BUDAYA%20BANTEN.pdf |title=Warisan Budaya Banten |author=Dr. Taufiqurokhman, Hari Widodo, SH.

==Geographic distribution==
[[File:Mataram Sultanate in Sultan Agung Reign id.svg|thumb|left|Area of the [[Mataram Sultanate]] kingdom that controls the [[Parahyangan]] region.]]
The Bantenese language in general does not recognize [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] of language, due to the fact that [[Banten]] was never under the rule or influence of the [[Mataram Sultanate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Claude Guillot, Hasan Muarif Ambary &amp; Jacques Dumarçay|title=Banten|year=1990|publisher=Gramedia Book Publishing Division|isbn=97-940-3922-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; differed from the Priangan dialect spoken in the [[Parahyangan]] region. This has caused the Bantenese language to be seen as a language that is still closely related to the old [[Sundanese language]].

[[File:Linguistic map West Java.png|thumb|right|Linguistic map of [[West Java]], [[Banten]] and [[Jakarta]].]]
Today, the Bantenese language is categorized as a western dialect of [[Sundanese language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bacatangerang.com/bahasa-sunda-tangerang-aing-tangerang-jasa/|title=Bahasa Sunda Tangerang (Aing Tangerang Jasa) - Baca Tangerang|website=www.bacatangerang.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dialect is generally spoken mostly in the southern region of [[Banten]], which are [[Lebak Regency|Lebak]] (including Cilangkahan region), and [[Pandeglang Regency]] (including Caringin and Cibaliung). In the northern [[Serang Regency]], this language is used daily by the people of Ciomas, Pabuaran, Padarincang, [[Cinangka]], Baros, Petir, Cikeusal, Kopo, Cikande, Pamarayan and parts of Anyar subdistrict.&lt;ref name="GDSDKS"&gt;{{cite book|author=Agus Suriamiharja, Hidayat &amp; Yoyo Mulyana|title=Geografi dialek Sunda di Kabupaten Serang|year=1981|publisher=Pusat Pembinaan dan Pengembangan Bahasa, Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaa|oclc=64958736}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dialect is also used by Sundanese transmigrants in [[Central Lampung Regency]], [[Lampung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anjunganlampung.com/regency-city/kabupaten-lampung-tengah/|title=Kabupaten Lampung Tengah {{!}} Anjungan Lampung|website=anjunganlampung.com|language=id-ID|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Serang Regency]], Bantenese language and Bantenese Javanese are both used daily by the people of Anyar, Mancak, Waringinkurung, Taktakan, Cipocok Jaya, Walantaka, as well as Kragilan subdistrict.&lt;ref name="GDSDKS" /&gt; This dialect is also used in some parts of [[Tangerang Regency]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tangselpos.co.id/2015/10/28/mulok-bahasa-sunda-terancam-punah/ |title=Mulok Bahasa Sunda Terancam Punah |author= |publisher=Tangsel Pos |date=28 August 2015 |accessdate=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in its southern, southwestern, midwest and northern parts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Taufik Ampera, Cece Subarna &amp; Tien Wartini|title=Bahasa dan sastra daerah di Kabupaten Tangerang : pengkajian budaya dan nilai-nilai tradisional pengkajian budaya dan nilai-nilai tradisional|year=2004|publisher=Pemerintah Kabupaten Tangerang|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in cities of [[Tangerang]] and [[South Tangerang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Multamia R. M. T. Lauder|title=Pemetaan dan distribusi bahasa-bahasa di Tangerang|year=1993|publisher=Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan|isbn=97-945-9368-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Baduy people]] in the Leuwidamar subdistrict of the [[Lebak Regency]] are active speakers of another [[Sundanese language]] dialect known as [[Baduy language|Baduy dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://joshuaproject.net/languages/bac |title=Language: Badui |publisher=[[Joshua Project]] |date= |accessdate=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Building Engineer''' is recognised as being expert in the use of [[technology]] in the [[design]], [[construction]], assessment and maintenance of the [[built environment]].&lt;ref&gt;Definition used by the CABE (Chartered Association of Building Engineer)&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial Building Engineers are concerned with the planning, design, construction, operation, renovation, and maintenance of buildings, as well as with their impacts on the surrounding environment.&lt;ref&gt;Information available from the website of the Concordia University in Montreal, Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==
===Australia===
In [[Australia]] building engineers, also known as architectural engineers may work on new building projects, or renovations of existing structures. Areas of study include:
* [[architectural history]] and design of buildings
* [[air conditioning]], lighting and electrical power distribution
* water supply and distribution
* fire and life safety systems
* [[sustainable building]] systems design
* building structures and building construction technology
* construction planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.vu.edu.au/courses/bachelor-of-engineering-honours-architectural-engineering-nhea |title=Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (Architectural Engineering) &amp;#124; Victoria University &amp;#124; Melbourne Australia |website=Vu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a multifaceted build environment professional, a building engineer can provide important leadership in the design and construction of the built environment, collaborating with architects, engineers, builders and other design professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/handbooks/courses/E3009.html |title=Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and Bachelor of Architectural Design |website=Monash.edu.au |date=2016-10-15 |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], Building Engineers have to follow an interdisciplinary program that integrates pertinent knowledge from different disciplines.  The building engineer explores all phases of the life cycle of a building and develops an appreciation of the building as an advanced technological system. Problems are identified and appropriate solutions found to improve the performance of the building in areas such as:
* Energy efficiency, passive solar engineering, lighting and acoustics;
* Indoor air quality;
* [[Construction management]]
* [[HVAC]] and control systems
* Advanced [[building materials]], building envelope
* Earthquake resistance, wind effects on buildings, [[computer-aided design]].

A building engineer can be a licensed professional, and in some countries is synonymous with an [[architect]]. Building engineers are licensed to perform whole-building design with architect-engineer teams, or as practitioners in structural, mechanical, or electrical fields of [[building design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadian-universities.net/Universities/Programs/Building_Engineering.html |title=Canada Building Engineering University Programs |website=Canadian-universities.net |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
Within the [[European Community]], building engineers are affiliated with the AEEBC (Association of European Experts in Building and Construction) one of the biggest pan-European bodies for construction professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeebc.org/members.html |title=AEEBC-Members &amp; Membership plus Affiliations |website=Aeebc.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The titles, tasks and duties of a building engineer may vary from one European State to another.

===Nigeria===
In [[Nigeria]] a building engineer is simply known as builder.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}
A builder is an academic trained specialist statutory registered professional responsible for Building Production, Management, Construction and Maintenance of Building for the use and protection of mankind. A builder must be a member of Nigeria institute of building(NIOB) and Council of Registered Builders of Nigeria(CORBON).{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The major consultancy services rendered by building engineers are listed below:
* Building production management
* Building maintenance management
* Project management
* Building surveying
* Feasibility and viability studies
* Facilities monitoring and evaluation
* Arbitration, meditation and expert witness.

Functions of building engineers in the building code before plan approval according to the National Building Code:
* Contract Drawing and specification prepared by registered architects anđ registered engineers;
* Priced bill of Quantities prepared by abregistered quantity surveyors;
* Construction programme, project quality management plan,project health and safety plan and Buildability and maintenance analysis prepared by a registered Builder;
* Conditions of contract.
* All-risk insurance for the building works, personnel and equipment.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], the title of "building engineer" is regulated by the [[Chartered Association of Building Engineers|CABE]] (Chartered Association of Building Engineers). The 'Chartered Association of Building Engineers' was founded as the 'Incorporated Association of Architects and Surveyors' (IAAS) in 1925 in London. The Incorporated Association of Architects and Surveyors became the 'Association of Building Engineers' (ABE) in 1993 and on obtaining its Royal Charter, became the 'Chartered Association of Building Engineers' (CABE) in 2014, its current name.

The CABE accredits university qualifications to use the title Chartered Building Engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbuilde.com/careers/accredited-universities/list-of-accredited-universities/ |title=List of Accredited Universities - Chartered Association of Building Engineers |website=Cbuilde.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the United Kingdom and Ireland, Chartered Building Engineers are involved within the design, planning, engineering, construction, legal compliance, fire safety, and maintenance of buildings. Their roles may vary from one practice to another. Building Engineers may offer specialised services within phases of the construction process or for different engineering aspects of the [[construction industry]], such as [[fire safety]], conservation, sustainability, planning or construction.

In England and Wales, 'Building Engineers' may also be state authorised "Approved Inspectors" (or are employed by a state authorised "Corporate Approved Inspector") and thus may provide UK "Building Regulations" compliance &amp; approval.

Many 'Building Engineers' are employed by Scottish, English and Welsh local authorities to enforce and apply the Building Regulations and other Building Act 1984 related functions, including public safety in respect of "Dangerous Structures", etc.

In the Republic of Ireland, where a semi-public building control system was implemented in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/si/9/made/en/print |title=S.I. No. 9/2014 - Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 |website=Irishstatutebook.ie |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chartered Building Engineers may register as Building Surveyors in order to act as certifiers for compliance with building regulations at design and construction stage.

The tasks and duties of the building engineer are:
* Design and preparation of plans
* Preparation of [[planning applications]]
* Remedial works
* Dilapidation schedules / negotiations
* Site inspections and certification of works
* Repair and maintenance of buildings
* Energy auditing and [[energy performance]] certificates
* Measured survey of land and buildings
* Advice on energy-saving designs
* Access audits
* Rehabilitation of properties
* Conservation
* [[Construction management]]
* [[Quantity surveying]]
* Fire safety and [[health and safety]]
* Demolition
* Negotiating, obtaining and implementing claims and grants
* Building variations
* Building inspections and surveys
* Advice on building law/party wall issues
* Checking building designs for compliance with the 'Building Regulations' and related 'Building' &amp; 'Fire' Legislation.
* Enforcement of breaches of the 'Building Regulations' and related 'Building' &amp; 'Fire' Legislation, including 'law court' proceedings.

===United States of America===
In the [[United States of America]] building engineering, also known as [[Architectural engineering]] is the application of engineering principles and technology to building design and construction. Definitions of an architectural engineer may refer to:
* An engineer in the structural, mechanical, electrical, construction or other engineering fields of building design and construction.
* A licensed engineering professional in parts of the United States.
* Architectural engineers are those who work with other engineers and architects for the designing and construction of buildings.

The [[architectural engineer]] applies the knowledge and skills of broader [[engineering]] disciplines to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, and renovation of buildings and their component systems while paying careful attention to their effects on the surrounding environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asce.org/architectural-engineering/architectural-engineering-institute/|title=Architectural Engineering Institute – ASCE|website=Asce.org|accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the establishment of a specific "Architectural Engineering" [[NCEES]] [[Professional Engineer]]ing registration examination in the 1990s, and first offering in April 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncees.org|title=Welcome to NCEES|website=Ncees.org|accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural Engineering is now recognized as a distinct engineering discipline in the United States.

In [[broadcast programming]], '''burning off''' is the airing of otherwise-abandoned [[television program]]s, usually by [[scheduling (broadcasting)|scheduling]] in [[graveyard slot|far less important time slots]], moving shows to less-important [[sister station|sister network]]s, or taking extensive [[Hiatus (television)|hiatuses]].

Abandoned programs may be burned off for a number of reasons: 
* They have to air to meet contractual or legal requirements.
* The production company needs enough first-run episodes to meet minimum requirements for syndication.
* Their use as "filler" is perceived as slightly more profitable than reruns or other fillers.

==Methods==
Up through the 1990s, this often meant the airing of [[television pilot|pilots]] for shows that were not going to be picked up, such as ''[[The Art of Being Nick]]'', ''[[Poochinski]]'', ''Heart and Soul'', and ''[[Barney Miller]]'', usually during the summer months to provide some form of new programming in the technical sense of the word. In a few cases, the pilot may prove popular enough that a series is eventually commissioned; such was the case with ''Barney Miller'' and ''[[The Seinfeld Chronicles]]'', the latter of which led to the long-running sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]''. Anthology series such as ''[[Love, American Style]]'' were devoted to many such failed pilots.

Since the late 1990s, episodes of long-running shows that are no longer hits and have been taken off the schedule have been burned off. ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'' is an example of a series whose entire final season was burned off (the series' ninth season aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the summer of 2004). In many cases, instead of airing the episodes during the regular television season, the episodes are held back and presented during the summer months to fulfill the network's obligation to air them and to produce at least some return on their investment. Another example occurs in 1997 when the remaining ''[[EZ Streets]]'' episodes aired on CBS, after its October 1996 cancellation. Yet another example of these is burned off episodes from the second season of ''[[Max Headroom (TV series)|Max Headroom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://benjamonsterstv.blogspot.com/2012/10/weekend-rewind-abc-1987-88-season.html|title=Benjamonster'sTV: WEEKEND REWIND: ABC 1987-88 Season|last=Benjamonstertv|date=2012-10-14|website=Benjamonster'sTV|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent examples of summer burn-offs include Fox's ''[[Sons of Tucson]]'' (2010) and the NBC medical/fantasy drama ''[[Do No Harm (TV series)|Do No Harm]]'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118017270.html |title=Fox axes 'Sons of Tucson'|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|accessdate=April 6, 2010|date=April 6, 2010|first=Michael|last=Schneider}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/03/human-target-lie-to-me-sons-of-tucson-keep-em-or-kill-em.html|title='Human Target,' 'Lie to Me,' 'Sons of Tucson': Keep 'em or kill 'em?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some programs may not air even in this form; in 2010, the final unaired episodes of the seldom-promoted ABC workplace comedy ''[[Better Off Ted]]'' were to be used solely as a filler just in case the [[2010 NBA Finals]] ended after five games. However, the Finals were a full seven-game series, and the remaining episodes of ''Better Off Ted'' would not premiere until the release of the series' second season [[DVD]] box set and eventual [[streaming media|streaming]] on [[Netflix]].

In one of the earliest examples of a burning-off, [[Milton Berle]], then in the middle of a 30-year contract witn [[NBC]], was installed as host of the show ''[[Jackpot Bowling]]'' when Berle, who was one of television's first major stars but was rapidly fading in the face of new competition, could no longer draw enough viewers to headline a [[variety show]] of his own.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1960/05/05/archives/cbs-postpones-bergman-tv-play-drama-delayed-indefinitely-when.html C.B.S. POSTPONES BERGMAN TV PLAY; Drama Delayed Indefinitely When Dire... - Free Preview - The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment failed after six months, and NBC finally terminated his contract in 1961.

During the 2009&amp;ndash;10 season, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] aired 37 first-run episodes of the sitcom ''[['Til Death]]'': 22 season four episodes and 15 unaired episodes from season three. The series had been renewed for a fourth season only after [[Sony Pictures Television]] offered Fox a discount on the licensing fee in order to get enough episodes aired to compile a saleable [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] package. Several episodes of the series were burned off in unusual time slots, including: four episodes in a [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] "[[marathon (television)|marathon]]", two episodes being aired against [[Super Bowl XLIV]], and three unaired third season episodes being broadcast in June after the fourth season (and series) finale had already aired in May.&lt;ref&gt;Fox Broadcasting.

Other examples include in television syndication, having a station pick up one program solely to air another, as was the case in 2009 when a syndicator offered [[Stripping (television)|stripped]] repeats of [[MTV]]'s ''[[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County|Laguna Beach]]'' which were of little interest to viewers or the stations themselves, but eventually led into the more popular MTV series ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]'', which was part of the same package. In the reverse, shows such as ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and ''[[Three's Company]]'' have had their [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] (in the mentioned cases, ''[[The Golden Palace]]'' and ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'') bundled together due to the strong continuity between the original series and the spin-off.

Often, the program is moved to a [[sister station|sister]] [[cable network]] into low-profile time slots to mute collateral damage to the main broadcast's schedule as much as possible. Such was the case with [[NBC]]'s broadcast airing of the MySpace series ''[[Quarterlife]]'', the ABC pageant reality series ''[[All American Girl (2003 TV series)|All American Girl]]'' and ABC's ''[[Greg Behrendt]]'s Wake Up Call''. In these cases, ''Quarterlife'' aired in the form of a one-day marathon on [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]], while ''All American Girl'' was placed on [[ABC Family]]. In the case of ''Wake Up Call'', the show never aired on ABC due to several factors, including the failure of Berhendt's [[The Greg Behrendt Show|self-titled talk show]] during the same season, and a glut of [[reality television|reality series]] during the 2006–07 summer season. The program was held up until January 2009, when it had a short run on ABC's [[SoapNet]]. In 2011, Fox similarly dumped the canceled sitcom ''[[Running Wilde]]'' on sister channel [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] after a short burn-off run on the network's late night Saturday lineup; FX consigned the show to four different time slots during the burn off. 

[[Nickelodeon]] often uses its sister networks [[TeenNick]] and [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]] to burn off series that failed on Nickelodeon, or to air acquired programming from its international sister networks which contractually require a minimum American run (the [[List of Oggy and the Cockroaches episodes#Season 4: 2012–13|fourth season of]] ''[[Oggy and the Cockroaches]]'', a show popular in its home European market but mediocre in American airings on [[Freeform (TV network)|Fox Family]] and Nickelodeon, is an example of this; it was removed from Nickelodeon and burned off in low-viewed Nicktoons timeslots as fast as possible due to light parental controversy involving unnoticed background comical nudity in an episode).

Similarly, [[Cartoon Network]] sometimes moves programming to [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]], airing acquired programming not fitting Cartoon Network's current programming direction (such as ''[[Grojband]]'' and ''[[The Garfield Show]]''), and also airing episodes of some of Cartoon Network's acquired shows before they aired on Cartoon Network (such as ''[[Johnny Test]]'' and ''[[Peanuts]]''). Original Cartoon Network programming moving to Boomerang while still in original production is much rarer than it is for Nickelodeon's networks (especially as Boomerang has less distribution than Nickelodeon's secondary networks), and Cartoon Network will usually burn off episodes on their network to provide closure to viewers. As the networks of [[Disney Channel]] are separated by age and gender ([[Disney XD]] has a young male focus, while [[Disney Junior]] is meant for young children), that network rarely directs little-watched programming to another network and instead merely downgrades series to lower-profile timeslots.

Another case involving cable television had the final five episodes of [[Syfy]]'s ''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]'' being burned off on January 4, 2011 after the network determined that it would neither renew the series nor be able to support a traditional finale due to scheduling factors.

In March 2014, the [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]] series ''[[Those Who Kill (U.S. TV series)|Those Who Kill]]'' was moved to [[LMN (TV channel)|Lifetime Movie Network]] after A&amp;E canceled the show following two low-rated episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benched A&amp;E Drama Series 'Those Who Kill' To Air On Sibling LMN|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/03/ae-drama-series-those-who-kill-to-air-on-lmn/|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=March 25, 2014|accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chimakuan''' language family consists of one extinct and one severely endangered language spoken in northwestern [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], United States, on the [[Olympic Peninsula]]. It is part of the [[Mosan languages|Mosan]] [[sprachbund]], and one of its languages is famous for having no [[nasal stop|nasal consonants]]. The two languages were about as close as English and [[German language|German]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Family division==
# '''[[Chemakum language|Chemakum]]''' (also known as Chimakum or Chimacum) ''(†)''
# '''[[Quileute language|Quileute]]''' (also known as Quillayute) ''(†)''

Chemakum is now [[Extinct language|extinct]]. It was spoken until the 1940s on the east side of the Olympic Peninsula between [[Port Townsend, Washington|Port Townsend]] and [[Hood Canal]]. The name Chemakum is an Anglicized version of a Salishan word for the [[Chimakum]] people, such as the nearby [[Skokomish (tribe)|Twana]] word ''čə́bqəb'' {{IPA|[t͡ʃə́bqəb]}} (earlier {{IPA|[t͡ʃə́mqəm]}}).

Quileute is now severely [[endangered language|endangered]]. It is spoken by a few people south of the [[Makah people|Makah]] on the western coast of the Olympic peninsula south of Cape Flattery at La Push and the lower [[Hoh River]]. The name Quileute comes from ''kʷoʔlí·yot''' {{IPA|[kʷoʔlíːjotʼ]}}, the name of a village at La Push.

==Phonology==
The Chimakuan languages have phonemic inventories similar to other languages of the Mosan sprachbund, with three vowels, [[ejective consonant]]s, [[uvular consonant]]s, and [[lateral affricate]]s. However, both languages have typological oddities: Chemakum had no simple [[velar consonant]]s, and Quileute has no [[nasal stop|nasal consonants]].

===Proto-Chimakuan===
The (pre-)Proto-Chimakuan sound system contained three vowels, long and short, and lexical stress. It had the following consonants.

In Proto-Chimakuan the series {{IPA|[t͡ʃ t͡ʃʼ ʃ]}} occurred (mostly?) before the vowel {{IPA|/i/}}. On the other hand, {{IPA|[kʷ kʷʼ xʷ]}} occurred (mostly?) before the vowels {{IPA|/a, o/}}. These series may have become separate phonemes before Chimakum and Quileute split, but if so, it seems clear that they had been [[allophone]]s not long before then.

In Quileute the stress became fixed to the penultimate syllable, though subsequent changes made it somewhat unpredictable, and the glottalized sonorants became allophonic with glottal stop-sonorant sequences and so can no longer be considered phonemic. Open syllables developed long vowels. Perhaps as recently as the late 19th century, the nasals {{IPA|/m n m̰ n̰/}} became voiced plosives {{IPA|/b d ʔb ʔd/}}.

In Chemakum, stressed vowels frequently acquired glottal stops; {{IPA|/t͡ʃ t͡ʃʼ ʃ/}} depalatalized to {{IPA|/t͡s t͡sʼ s/}}, while {{IPA|/k kʼ x/}} palatalized to {{IPA|/t͡ʃ t͡ʃʼ ʃ/}}; sonorants lost their glottalization; and the approximants {{IPA|/j w j̰ w̰/}} hardened to {{IPA|/t͡ʃ kʷ/}} in the environment of stressed vowels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5021">In mathematics and computer science, the '''critical exponent''' of a finite or infinite sequence of symbols over a finite alphabet describes the largest number of times a contiguous subsequence can be repeated.  For example, the critical exponent of "Mississippi" is 7/3, as it contains the string "ississi", which is of length 7 and period 3.

If ''w'' is an infinite word over the alphabet ''A'' and ''x'' is a finite word over ''A'', then ''x'' is said to occur in ''w'' with exponent α, for positive real α, if there is a factor ''y'' of ''w'' with ''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a prefix of ''x'', ''a'' is the integer part of α, and the length |''y''| ≥ α |''x''|: we say that ''y'' is an  ''α-power''.  The word ''w'' is  ''α-power-free'' if it contains no factors which are  α-powers.&lt;ref name=K281&gt;{{harvtxt|Krieger|2006}} p.281&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''critical exponent'' for ''w'' is the [[supremum]] of the  α for which ''w'' has  α-powers,&lt;ref name=BLRS126&gt;Berstel et al (2009) p.126&lt;/ref&gt; or equivalently the [[infimum]] of the  α for which ''w'' is  α-power-free.&lt;ref name=K280/&gt;

==Examples==
* The critical exponent of the [[Fibonacci word]] is (5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{radic|5}})/2 ≈ 3.618.&lt;ref name=K280/&gt;&lt;ref name =AS37&gt;{{harvtxt|Allouche|Shallit|2003}} p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
* The critical exponent of the [[Thue–Morse sequence]] is 2.&lt;ref name=K280/&gt;  The word contains arbitrarily long squares, but in any factor ''xxb'' the letter ''b'' is not a prefix of ''x''.

==Properties==
* The critical exponent can take any real value greater than 1.&lt;ref name=K280/&gt;{{sfnp|Krieger|Shallit|2007}}
* The critical exponent of a [[morphic word]] over a finite alphabet is either infinite or an [[algebraic number]] of degree at most the size of the alphabet.&lt;ref name=K280&gt;{{harvtxt|Krieger|2006}} p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repetition threshold==
The '''repetition threshold''' of an alphabet ''A'' of ''n'' letters is the minimum critical exponent of infinite words over ''A'': clearly this value RT(''n'') depends only on ''n''.  For ''n''=2, any binary word of length four has a factor of exponent 2, and since the critical exponent of the Thue–Morse sequence is 2, the repetition threshold for binary alphabets is RT(2) = 2.  It is known that RT(3) = 7/4, RT(4) = 7/5 and that for ''n''≥5 we have RT(''n'') ≥ ''n''/(''n''-1).  It is conjectured that the latter is the true value, and this has been established for 5 ≤ ''n'' ≤ 14 and for ''n'' ≥ 33.&lt;ref name=BLRS126/&gt;&lt;ref name=AS37/&gt;
Recently, M. Rao completed the proof for all values of ''n''.

The conjecture is due to Eric Dittert and (independently) Bruce Hajek.&lt;ref name=Hogben&gt;{{cite book|editor=Hogben, Leslie|title=Handbook of Linear Algebra|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=2014|pages=43–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Er7MBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=SA42-PA42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cheon&gt;{{cite journal|volume=436|issue=4|date=15 February 2012|pages=791–801|title=Some results towards the Dittert conjecture on permanents|journal=Linear Algebra and its Applications|author=Cheon, Gi-Sang|author2=Wanless, Ian M.|doi=10.1016/j.laa.2010.08.041}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=81909|title=Eric R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41999">'''Electricity price forecasting (EPF)''' is a branch of [[energy forecasting]] which focuses on predicting the [[Spot contract|spot]] and [[forward price]]s in wholesale [[electricity market]]s. Over the last 15 years electricity price forecasts have become a fundamental input to energy companies’ decision-making mechanisms at the corporate level.

== Background ==
Since the early 1990s, the process of [[deregulation]] and the introduction of [[Electricity market|competitive electricity markets]] have been reshaping the landscape of the traditionally monopolistic and government-controlled power sectors. Throughout Europe, North America and Australia, electricity is now traded under market rules using [[Spot contract|spot]] and [[Derivative (finance)|derivative contracts]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Electricity price forecasting: A review of the state-of-the-art with a look into the future|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207014001083|journal = International Journal of Forecasting|date = 2014|pages = 1030–1081|volume = 30|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/j.ijforecast.2014.08.008|first = Rafał|last = Weron|others = [Open Access]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modelling Prices in Competitive Electricity Markets|publisher = Wiley|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0-470-84860-9|location = |pages = |editor-last = Bunn|editor-first = Derek W.|url = http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047084860X.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, electricity is a very special commodity: it is economically non-storable and power system stability requires a constant balance between production and consumption. At the same time, electricity demand depends on weather (temperature, wind speed, precipitation, etc.) and the intensity of business and everyday activities ([[Load profile|on-peak vs. off-peak hours]], weekdays vs. weekends, holidays, etc.). These unique characteristics lead to price dynamics not observed in any other market, exhibiting daily, weekly and often annual [[seasonality]] and abrupt, short-lived and generally unanticipated [[price spike]]s.

Extreme [[Volatility (finance)|price volatility]], which can be up to two orders of magnitude higher than that of any other commodity or financial asset, has forced market participants to hedge not only volume but also price risk. Price forecasts from a few hours to a few months ahead have become of particular interest to power portfolio managers. A power market company able to forecast the volatile wholesale prices with a reasonable level of accuracy can adjust its bidding strategy and its own production or consumption schedule in order to reduce the risk or maximize the profits in day-ahead trading.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modeling and Forecasting Electricity Loads and Prices: A Statistical Approach|last = Weron|first = Rafał|publisher = Wiley|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0-470-05753-7|location = |pages = |url = http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047005753X.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ballpark estimate of savings from a 1% reduction in the [[mean absolute percentage error]] (MAPE) of short-term price forecasts is $300,000 per year for a [[Public utility|utility]] with 1GW [[Load profile|peak load]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.energybiz.com/magazine/article/404587/crystal-ball-lessons-predictive-analytics|title = Crystal Ball Lessons in Predictive Analytics|last = Hong|first = Tao|date = 2015|journal = EnergyBiz Magazine|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = Spring|pages = 35–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taxonomy of modeling approaches ==
[[File:EPF taxonomy wiki v2.png|thumb|A taxonomy of electricity price forecasting (EPF) and modeling approaches according to Weron (2014).]]
A variety of methods and ideas have been tried for EPF over the last 15 years, with varying degrees of success. They can be broadly classified into six groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Multi-agent models ===
''Multi-agent'' ([[Agent-based model|''multi-agent simulation'']]'', equilibrium, [[Game theory|game theoretic]]'') models simulate the operation of a system of heterogeneous agents (generating units, companies) interacting with each other, and build the price process by matching the demand and supply in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Electricity market modeling trends|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421503003161|journal = Energy Policy|date = 2005|pages = 897–913|volume = 33|issue = 7|doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2003.10.013|first = Mariano|last = Ventosa|first2 = Álvaro|last2 = Baı́llo|first3 = Andrés|last3 = Ramos|first4 = Michel|last4 = Rivier}}&lt;/ref&gt; This class includes ''cost-based models'' (or ''production-cost models'', PCM),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Power Generation, Operation and Control|last = Wood|first = A.J.|publisher = Wiley|year = 1996|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Wollenberg|first2 = B.F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''equilibrium'' or ''game theoretic'' approaches (like the Nash-Cournot framework, supply function equilibrium - SFE, strategic production-cost models - SPCM)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Forecasting the Mean and the Variance of Electricity Prices in Deregulated Markets|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=4414354|journal = IEEE Transactions on Power Systems|date = 2008|issn = 0885-8950|pages = 25–32|volume = 23|issue = 1|doi = 10.1109/TPWRS.2007.913195|first = C.M.|last = Ruibal|first2 = M.|last2 = Mazumdar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Stochastic models for bidding strategies on oligopoly electricity market|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00186-008-0252-7|journal = Mathematical Methods of Operations Research|date = 2009|issn = 1432-2994|pages = 579–592|volume = 69|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s00186-008-0252-7|first = Magdalena|last = Borgosz-Koczwara|first2 = Aleksander|last2 = Weron|first3 = Agnieszka|last3 = Wyłomańska}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A strategic production costing model for electricity market price analysis|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=1388494|journal = IEEE Transactions on Power Systems|date = 2005|issn = 0885-8950|pages = 67–74|volume = 20|issue = 1|doi = 10.1109/TPWRS.2004.831266|first = Carlos|last = Batlle|first2 = J.|last2 = Barquin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[agent-based model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Learning Agents in an Artificial Power Exchange: Tacit Collusion, Market Power and Efficiency of Two Double-auction Mechanisms|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10614-008-9127-5|journal = Computational Economics|date = 2008|issn = 0927-7099|pages = 73–98|volume = 32|issue = 1-2|doi = 10.1007/s10614-008-9127-5|first = Eric|last = Guerci|first2 = Stefano|last2 = Ivaldi|first3 = Silvano|last3 = Cincotti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multi-agent models generally focus on qualitative issues rather than quantitative results. They may provide insights as to whether or not prices will be above marginal costs, and how this might influence the players’ outcomes. However, they pose problems if more quantitative conclusions have to be drawn, particularly if electricity prices have to be predicted with a high level of precision.

=== Fundamental models ===
''Fundamental'' (''structural'') methods try to capture the basic physical and economic relationships which are present in the production and trading of electricity.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Managing Energy Risk: An Integrated View on Power and Other Energy Markets|url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9781119209102|doi = 10.1002/9781119209102|last = Burger|first = M.|last2 = Graeber|first2 = B.|last3 = Schindlmayr|first3 = G.|publisher = Wiley|year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The functional associations between fundamental drivers (loads, weather conditions, system parameters, etc.) are postulated, and the fundamental inputs are modeled and predicted independently, often via statistical, reduced-form or [[computational intelligence]] techniques. In general, two subclasses of fundamental models can be identified: ''parameter rich models''&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Energy and Power Risk Management: New Developments in Modeling, Pricing, and Hedging|last = Eydeland|first = Alexander|publisher = Wiley|year = 2003|isbn = 978-0-471-10400-1|location = |pages = |last2 = Wolyniec|first2 = Krzysztof|url = http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471104000.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''parsimonious structural models''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Survey of Commodity Markets and Structural Models for Electricity Prices|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-7248-3_2|publisher = Springer New York|date = 2014|isbn = 978-1-4614-7247-6|pages = 41–83|doi = 10.1007/978-1-4614-7248-3_2|first = René|last = Carmona|first2 = Michael|last2 = Coulon|editor-first = Fred Espen|editor-last = Benth|editor-first2 = Valery A.|editor-last2 = Kholodnyi|editor-first3 = Peter|editor-last3 = Laurence}}&lt;/ref&gt; of supply and demand.

Two major challenges arise in the practical implementation of fundamental models: data availability and incorporation of stochastic fluctuations of the fundamental drivers. In building the model, we make specific assumptions about physical and economic relationships in the marketplace, and therefore the price projections generated by the models are very sensitive to violations of these assumptions.

=== Reduced-form models ===
''Reduced-form'' (''quantitative, [[Stochastic model|stochastic]]'') models characterize the statistical properties of electricity prices over time, with the ultimate objective of [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives valuation]] and [[risk management]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Their main intention is not to provide accurate hourly price forecasts, but rather to replicate the main characteristics of daily electricity prices, like [[marginal distribution]]s at future time points, price dynamics, and correlations between commodity prices. If the price process chosen is not appropriate for capturing the main properties of electricity prices, the results from the model are likely to be unreliable. However, if the model is too complex, the computational burden will prevent its use on-line in trading departments. Depending on the type of market under consideration, reduced-form models can be classified as:
* ''Spot price models'', which provide a parsimonious representation of the dynamics of spot prices. Their main drawback is the problem of pricing derivatives, i.e., the identification of the risk premium linking spot and forward prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Revisiting the relationship between spot and futures prices in the Nord Pool electricity market|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988314000541|journal = Energy Economics|date = 2014|pages = 178–190|volume = 44|doi = 10.1016/j.eneco.2014.03.007|first = Rafał|last = Weron|first2 = Michał|last2 = Zator}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most popular subclasses include [[Jump diffusion|jump-diffusion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Market price of risk implied by Asian-style electricity options and futures|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014098830700076X|journal = Energy Economics|date = 2008|pages = 1098–1115|volume = 30|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.eneco.2007.05.004|first = Rafał|last = Weron}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A critical empirical study of three electricity spot price models|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988311002866|journal = Energy Economics|date = 2012|pages = 1589–1616|volume = 34|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.eneco.2011.11.012|first = Fred Espen|last = Benth|first2 = Rüdiger|last2 = Kiesel|first3 = Anna|last3 = Nazarova}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Markov regime-switching]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An empirical comparison of alternate regime-switching models for electricity spot prices|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988310000885|journal = Energy Economics|date = 2010|pages = 1059–1073|volume = 32|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.eneco.2010.05.008|first = Joanna|last = Janczura|first2 = Rafal|last2 = Weron}}&lt;/ref&gt; models.
* ''Forward price models'' allow for the pricing of derivatives in a straightforward manner (but only of those written on the forward price of electricity). However, they too have their limitations; most importantly, the lack of data that can be used for calibration and the inability to derive the properties of spot prices from the analysis of forward curves.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Stochastic Modeling of Electricity and Related Markets|url = http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/6811|doi = 10.1142/6811|first = Fred Espen|last = Benth|first2 = Jūratė Šaltytė|last2 = Benth|first3 = Steen|last3 = Koekebakker|publisher = World Scientific|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statistical models ===
''Statistical'' (''[[Econometric model|econometric]], [[technical analysis]]'') methods forecast the current price by using a mathematical combination of the previous prices and/or previous or current values of exogenous factors, typically consumption and production figures, or weather variables.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The two most important categories are ''additive'' and ''multiplicative'' models. They differ in whether the predicted price is the sum (additive) of a number of components or the product (multiplicative) of a number of factors. The former are far more popular, but the two are closely related - a multiplicative model for prices can be transformed into an additive model for log-prices. Statistical models are attractive because some physical interpretation may be attached to their components, thus allowing engineers and system operators to understand their behavior. They are often criticized for their limited ability to model the (usually) nonlinear behavior of electricity prices and related fundamental variables. However, in practical applications, their performances are not worse than those of the non-linear [[computational intelligence]] methods (see below). For instance, in the ''load forecasting track'' of the [[Global Energy Forecasting Competition|Global Energy Forecasting Competition (GEFCom2012)]] attracting hundreds of participants worldwide, the top four winning entries used regression-type models.
[[File:EPF ANN wiki.png|thumb|A taxonomy of the [[artificial neural network]] architectures that are most popular in EPF (see Weron, 2014). Input nodes are denoted by filled circles, output nodes by empty circles, and nodes in the hidden layer by empty circles with a dashed outline. The [[activation function]]s for [[Radial basis function network|RBF networks]] are radial basis functions, whereas [[Multi-layer perceptron|multi-layer perceptrons (MLP)]] typically use piecewise linear or sigmoid activation functions (illustrated in circles).]]

=== Computational intelligence models ===
''[[Computational intelligence]]'' (''[[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence-based]], [[machine learning]], non-parametric, non-linear statistical'') techniques combine elements of learning, evolution and fuzziness to create approaches that are capable of adapting to complex dynamic systems, and may be regarded as "intelligent" in this sense. [[Artificial neural network]]s,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets by a new fuzzy neural network|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=1626395|journal = IEEE Transactions on Power Systems|date = 2006|issn = 0885-8950|pages = 887–896|volume = 21|issue = 2|doi = 10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873409|first = N.|last = Amjady}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keles|first=Dogan|last2=Scelle|first2=Jonathan|last3=Paraschiv|first3=Florentina|last4=Fichtner|first4=Wolf|date=2016|title=Extended forecast methods for day-ahead electricity spot prices applying artificial neural networks|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261915012039|journal=Applied Energy|volume=162|issue=|pages=218–230|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.09.087|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[fuzzy systems]]&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Energy price forecasting in the Ontario competitive power system market|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=1266590|journal = IEEE Transactions on Power Systems|date = 2004|issn = 0885-8950|pages = 366–374|volume = 19|issue = 1|doi = 10.1109/TPWRS.2003.821470|first = C.P.|last = Rodriguez|first2 = G.J.|last2 = Anders}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[support vector machine]]s (SVM)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mid-term electricity market clearing price forecasting: A hybrid LSSVM and ARMAX approach|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142061513001658|journal = International Journal of Electrical Power &amp; Energy Systems|date = 2013|pages = 20–26|volume = 53|doi = 10.1016/j.ijepes.2013.04.006|first = Xing|last = Yan|first2 = Nurul A.|last2 = Chowdhury}}&lt;/ref&gt; are unquestionably the main classes of computational intelligence techniques in EPF. Their major strength is the ability to handle complexity and non-linearity. In general, computational intelligence methods are better at modeling these features of electricity prices than the statistical techniques (see above). At the same time, this flexibility is also their major weakness. The ability to adapt to nonlinear, spiky behaviors will not necessarily result in better point or probabilistic forecasts.

=== Hybrid models ===
Many of the modeling and price forecasting approaches considered in the literature are ''hybrid'' solutions, combining techniques from two or more of the groups listed above. Their classification is non-trivial, if possible at all.
As an example of hybrid model AleaModel (AleaSoft) combines Neural Networks and Box Jenkins models.

== Forecasting horizons ==
It is customary to talk about short-, medium- and long-term forecasting,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but there is no consensus in the literature as to what the thresholds should actually be:
* ''Short-term forecasting'' generally involves horizons from a few minutes up to a few days ahead, and is of prime importance in day-to-day market operations.
* ''Medium-term'' ''forecasting'', from a few days to a few months ahead, is generally preferred for [[balance sheet]] calculations, [[risk management]] and [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives pricing]]. In many cases, especially in electricity price forecasting, evaluation is based not on the actual point forecasts, but on the distributions of prices over certain future time periods. As this type of modeling has a long-standing tradition in [[finance]], an inflow of "finance solutions" is observed.
* ''Long-term'' ''forecasting'', with lead times measured in months, quarters or even years, concentrates on [[Valuation (finance)|investment profitability analysis]] and planning, such as determining the future sites or fuel sources of power plants.

== Future of electricity price forecasting ==
In his extensive review paper, Weron&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; looks ahead and speculates on the directions EPF will or should take over the next decade or so:

=== Fundamental price drivers and input variables ===

==== Seasonality ====
A key point in electricity spot price modeling and forecasting is the appropriate treatment of seasonality.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janczura|first=Joanna|last2=Trück|first2=Stefan|last3=Weron|first3=Rafał|last4=Wolff|first4=Rodney C.|date=2013|title=Identifying spikes and seasonal components in electricity spot price data: A guide to robust modeling|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988313000625|journal=Energy Economics|volume=38|pages=96–110|doi=10.1016/j.eneco.2013.03.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; And it should be emphasized that the electricity price exhibits seasonality at three levels: the daily and weekly, and to some extent - the annual. In ''short-term forecasting'', the annual or long-term seasonality is usually ignored, but the daily and weekly patterns (including a separate treatment of holidays) are of prime importance. This, however, may not be the right approach. As Nowotarski and Weron&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nowotarski|first=Jakub|last2=Weron|first2=Rafał|date=2016|title=On the importance of the long-term seasonal component in day-ahead electricity price forecasting|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014098831630127X|journal=Energy Economics|volume=57|issue=|pages=228–235|doi=10.1016/j.eneco.2016.05.009|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have recently shown, decomposing a series of electricity prices into a long-term seasonal and a stochastic component, modeling them independently and combining their forecasts can bring - contrary to a common belief - an accuracy gain compared to an approach in which a given model is calibrated to the prices themselves. 

In ''mid-term forecasting'', the daily patterns become less relevant and most EPF models work with average daily prices. However, the long-term trend-cycle component plays a crucial role. Its misspecification can introduce bias, which may lead to a bad estimate of the mean reversion level or of the price spike intensity and severity, and consequently, to underestimating the risk. Finally, in the ''long term'', when the time horizon is measured in years, the daily, weekly and even annual seasonality may be ignored, and long-term trends dominate. Adequate treatment - both in-sample and [[Out of sample testing|out-of-sample]] - of seasonality has not been given enough attention in the literature so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nowotarski|first=Jakub|last2=Tomczyk|first2=Jakub|last3=Weron|first3=Rafał|date=2013|title=Robust estimation and forecasting of the long-term seasonal component of electricity spot prices|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988313000686|journal=Energy Economics|volume=39|issue=|pages=13–27|doi=10.1016/j.eneco.2013.04.004|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lisi|first=Francesco|last2=Nan|first2=Fany|date=2014|title=Component estimation for electricity prices: Procedures and comparisons|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988314000656|journal=Energy Economics|volume=44|issue=|pages=143–159|doi=10.1016/j.eneco.2014.03.018|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weron|first=Rafał|last2=Zator|first2=Michał|date=2015|title=A note on using the Hodrick–Prescott filter in electricity markets|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988314002990|journal=Energy Economics|volume=48|issue=|pages=1–6|doi=10.1016/j.eneco.2014.11.014|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Variable selection ====
Another crucial issue in electricity price forecasting is the appropriate choice of explanatory variables.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gianfreda|first=Angelica|last2=Grossi|first2=Luigi|date=2012|title=Forecasting Italian electricity zonal prices with exogenous variables|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988312001338|journal=Energy Economics|volume=34|issue=6|pages=2228–2239|doi=10.1016/j.eneco.2012.06.024|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ziel|first=Florian|last2=Steinert|first2=Rick|last3=Husmann|first3=Sven|date=2015|title=Efficient modeling and forecasting of electricity spot prices|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988314002576|journal=Energy Economics|volume=47|issue=|pages=98–111|doi=10.1016/j.eneco.2014.10.012|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from historical electricity prices, the current spot price is dependent on a large set of fundamental drivers, including system loads, weather variables, fuel costs, the [[reserve margin]] (i.e., available generation minus/over predicted demand) and information about scheduled maintenance and forced [[Power outage|outages]]. Although "pure price" models are sometimes used for EPF, in the most common day-ahead forecasting scenario most authors select a combination of these fundamental drivers, based on the heuristics and experience of the forecaster.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Energy price forecasting - problems and proposals for such predictions|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=1597990|journal = IEEE Power and Energy Magazine|date = 2006|issn = 1540-7977|pages = 20–29|volume = 4|issue = 2|doi = 10.1109/MPAE.2006.1597990|first = N.|last = Amjady|first2 = M.|last2 = Hemmati}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very rarely has an automated selection or [[Shrinkage (statistics)|shrinkage]] procedure been carried out in EPF, especially for a large set of initial explanatory variables.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uniejewski|first=Bartosz|last2=Nowotarski|first2=Jakub|last3=Weron|first3=Rafał|date=2016-08-05|title=Automated Variable Selection and Shrinkage for Day-Ahead Electricity Price Forecasting|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/9/8/621|journal=Energies|language=en|volume=9|issue=8|pages=621|doi=10.3390/en9080621}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[machine learning]] literature provides viable tools that can be broadly classified into two categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4614-7138-7|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R|last=James|first=Gareth|last2=Witten|first2=Daniela|last3=Hastie|first3=Trevor|last4=Tibshirani|first4=Robert|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-7138-7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Feature selection|Feature or subset selection]], which involves identifying a subset of predictors that we believe to be influential, then fitting a model on the reduced set of variables. 
* [[Shrinkage (statistics)|Shrinkage]] (also known as [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]]), that fits the full model with all predictors using an algorithm that shrinks the estimated coefficients towards zero, which can significantly reduce their variance. Depending on what type of shrinkage is performed, some of the coefficients may be shrunk to zero itself. As such, some [[Shrinkage (statistics)|shrinkage]] methods - like the [[Lasso (statistics)|lasso]] - ''de facto'' perform [[variable selection]].
Some of these techniques have been utilized in the context of EPF:

* and [[Elastic net|elastic nets]],&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; 
but their use is not common. Further development and employment of methods for selecting the most effective input variables - from among the past electricity prices, as well as the past and predicted values of the fundamental drivers - is needed.

==== Spike forecasting and the reserve margin ====
When predicting spike occurrences or spot price volatility, one of the most influential fundamental variables is the [[reserve margin]], also called [[surplus generation]]. It relates the available capacity (generation, supply), &lt;math&gt;C_t&lt;/math&gt;, to the demand (load), &lt;math&gt;D_t&lt;/math&gt;, at a given moment in time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. The traditional engineering notion of the reserve margin defines it as the difference between the two, i.e., &lt;math&gt;RM = C_t - D_t&lt;/math&gt;, but many authors prefer to work with dimensionless ratios &lt;math&gt;\rho_t=D_t/C_t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_t=C_t/D_t -1&lt;/math&gt; or the so-called capacity utilization &lt;math&gt;CU_t=1 - D_t/C_t&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Its rare application in EPF can be justified only by the difficulty of obtaining good quality reserve margin data. Given that more and more system operators (see e.g. http://www.elexon.co.uk) are disclosing such information nowadays, reserve margin data should be playing a significant role in EPF in the near future.

=== Probabilistic forecasts ===
The use of [[prediction interval]]s (PI) and densities, or [[probabilistic forecasting]], has become much more common over the past three decades, as practitioners have come to understand the limitations of point forecasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = 25 years of time series forecasting|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207006000021|journal = International Journal of Forecasting|date = 2006|pages = 443–473|volume = 22|series = Twenty five years of forecasting|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.ijforecast.2006.01.001|first = Jan G.|last = De Gooijer|first2 = Rob J.|last2 = Hyndman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the bold move by the organizers of the [[Global Energy Forecasting Competition|Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014]] to require the participants to submit forecasts of the 99 [[percentile]]s of the predictive distribution (day-ahead in the price track) and not the point forecasts as in the 2012 edition,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207013000745|journal = International Journal of Forecasting|date = 2014|pages = 357–363|volume = 30|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.ijforecast.2013.07.001|first = Tao|last = Hong|first2 = Pierre|last2 = Pinson|first3 = Shu|last3 = Fan}}&lt;/ref&gt; this does not seem to be a common case in EPF as yet.

If PIs are computed at all, they usually are distribution-based (and approximated by the standard deviation of the model residuals&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) or empirical. The latter method resembles the estimation of the [[Value at risk|Value-at-Risk]] via [[Historical simulation (finance)|historical simulation]], and consists of computing sample [[quantile]]s of the empirical distribution of the one-step-ahead prediction errors. A new forecast combination (see below) technique has been introduced recently in the context of EPF. [[Quantile regression averaging|Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA)]] involves applying [[quantile regression]] to the point forecasts of a small number of individual forecasting models or experts, hence allows to leverage existing development of point forecasting.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Computing electricity spot price prediction intervals using quantile regression and forecast averaging|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00180-014-0523-0|journal = Computational Statistics|date = 2015|issn = 0943-4062|pages = 791–803|volume = 30|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s00180-014-0523-0|first = Jakub|last = Nowotarski|first2 = Rafał|last2 = Weron|others = [Open Access]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Combining forecasts ===
[[Consensus forecast]]s, also known as ''combining forecasts'', ''forecast averaging'' or ''model averaging'' (in [[econometrics]] and [[statistics]]) and ''[[committee machine]]s'', ''[[ensemble averaging]]'' or ''expert aggregation'' (in [[machine learning]]), are predictions of the future that are created by combining together several separate forecasts which have often been created using different methodologies. Despite their popularity in econometrics, averaged forecasts have not been used extensively in the context of [[electricity market]]s to date. There is some limited evidence on the adequacy of combining forecasts of electricity demand,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Using combined forecasts with changing weights for electricity demand profiling|url = http://www.palgrave-journals.com/doifinder/10.1057/palgrave.jors.2600856|journal = Journal of the Operational Research Society|pages = 72–82|volume = 51|issue = 1|doi = 10.1057/palgrave.jors.2600856|first = J W|last = Taylor|first2 = S|last2 = Majithia|year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was only very recently that combining was used in EPF and only for point forecasts.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Combining day-ahead forecasts for British electricity prices|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988311002921|journal = Energy Economics|date = 2013|pages = 88–103|volume = 35|series = Quantitative Analysis of Energy Markets|doi = 10.1016/j.eneco.2011.12.001|first = Silvano|last = Bordignon|first2 = Derek W.|last2 = Bunn|first3 = Francesco|last3 = Lisi|first4 = Fany|last4 = Nan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An empirical comparison of alternative schemes for combining electricity spot price forecasts|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988314001716|journal = Energy Economics|date = 2014|pages = 395–412|volume = 46|doi = 10.1016/j.eneco.2014.07.014|first = Jakub|last = Nowotarski|first2 = Eran|last2 = Raviv|first3 = Stefan|last3 = Trück|first4 = Rafał|last4 = Weron}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining probabilistic (i.e., interval and density) forecasts is much less popular, even in econometrics in general, mainly because of the increased complexity of the problem. Since [[Quantile regression averaging|Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA)]] allows to leverage existing development of point forecasting,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; it is particularly attractive from a practical point of view and may become a popular tool in EPF in the near future.

=== Multivariate factor models ===
The literature on forecasting daily electricity prices has concentrated largely on models that use only information at the aggregated (i.e., daily) level. On the other hand, the very rich body of literature on forecasting intra-day prices has used disaggregated data (i.e., hourly or half-hourly), but generally has not explored the complex dependence structure of the multivariate price series.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If we want to explore the structure of intra-day electricity prices, we need to use dimension reduction methods; for instance, factor models with factors estimated as [[principal components]] (PC). Empirical evidence indicates that there are forecast improvements from incorporating disaggregated (i.e., hourly or zonal) data for predicting daily system prices, especially when the forecast horizon exceeds one week.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Forecasting of daily electricity prices with factor models: utilizing intra-day and inter-zone relationships|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00180-014-0531-0|journal = Computational Statistics|date = 2015|issn = 0943-4062|pages = 805–819|volume = 30|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s00180-014-0531-0|first = Katarzyna|last = Maciejowska|first2 = Rafał|last2 = Weron|others = [Open Access]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Forecasting day-ahead electricity prices: Utilizing hourly prices|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988315001668|journal = Energy Economics|date = 2015|pages = 227–239|volume = 50|doi = 10.1016/j.eneco.2015.05.014|first = Eran|last = Raviv|first2 = Kees E.|last2 = Bouwman|first3 = Dick|last3 = van Dijk}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increase of computational power, the real-time calibration of these complex models will become feasible and we may expect to see more EPF applications of the multivariate framework in the coming years.

=== A universal test ground ===
All major review publications conclude that there are problems with comparing the methods developed and used in the EPF literature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This is due mainly to the use of different datasets, different software implementations of the forecasting models and different error measures, but also to the lack of statistical rigor in many studies. This calls for a comprehensive, thorough study involving (i) the same datasets, (ii) the same robust error evaluation procedures, and (iii) statistical testing of the significance of one model's outperformance of another. To some extent, the [[Global Energy Forecasting Competition|Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014]] has addressed these issues. Yet more has to be done. A selection of the better-performing measures (weighted-MAE, seasonal MASE or RMSSE) should be used either exclusively or in conjunction with the more popular ones (MAPE, RMSE). The empirical results should be further tested for the significance of the differences in forecasting accuracies of the models.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29638">The '''endurance running hypothesis''' is the [[hypothesis]] that the evolution of certain human characteristics can be explained as adaptations to long distance running.&lt;ref name="Carrier" /&gt;&lt;ref name="number8"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bramble|first=Dennis|author2=Lieberman, Daniel|title=Endurance running and the evolution of Homo|journal=Nature|date=November 2004|volume=432|doi=10.1038/nature03052|pmid=15549097|pages=345–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis suggests that endurance running played an important role for early [[hominins]] in obtaining food. Researchers have proposed that endurance running began as an adaptation for scavenging and later for [[persistence hunting]].

==Anatomical and physiological adaptations==

===Running vs. walking===
Much research has been geared towards the mechanics of how [[bipedal]] walking has evolved in the genus ''[[Homo]]''. However, little research has been conducted to examine how the specific adaptations for running emerged, and how they influenced human evolution.

The bit of research that has focused on human running provides much evidence for bodily function and structures that improve running only, and are not used in walking. This suggests that running was an adaptation, not that it came about as a byproduct of walking.

Running and walking incorporated different biomechanisms. Walking requires an "inverted pendulum" where the body's center of mass is shifted over the extended leg, to exchange potential and kinetic energy with each step.&lt;ref name="number8"/&gt; Running involves a "mass spring" mechanism to exchange potential and kinetic energy, with the use of tendons and ligaments. Tendons and ligaments are elastic tissues that store energy. They are stretched and then release energy as they recoil. This mass spring mechanism becomes less energetically costly at faster speeds and is therefore more efficient than the inverted pendulum of walking mechanics when traveling at greater speeds.&lt;ref name=number8 /&gt; Tendons and ligaments, however, do not provide these benefits in walking.

Although the mass spring mechanism can be more energetically favorable at higher speeds, it also results in an increase in ground reaction forces&lt;ref name=number8 /&gt; and is less stable because there is more movement and pitching of the limbs and core of the body. Ground forces and body pitching movement is less of an issue in the walking gait, where the position of the body's center of mass varies less, making walking an inherently more stable gait. In response to the destabilization of the running gait, the human body appears to have evolved adaptations to increase stabilization, as well as for the mass-spring mechanism in general. These adaptations, described below, are all evidence for selection for endurance running.

===Skeletal evidence===
Many researchers compare the skeletal structures of early hominins such as ''[[Australopithecus]]'' to those of ''Homo'' in order to identify structural differences that may be significant to endurance running.

'''[[Nuchal ligament]]:''' Because the head is decoupled from the shoulders, early ''Homo'' needed a way to stabilize the head. The nuchal ligament is an important evolved feature in head stabilization. It starts at the midline of the [[occiput]] and connects to the upper [[trapezius]]. This ligament is also important in terms of archaeological findings, because it leaves a small indentation and ridge in the skull, allowing researchers to see if various species had a nuchal ligament. The ability to see traces of ligaments in archaeological findings is rare because they degrade quickly and often leave no trace. In the case of the nuchal ligament, a trace of its existence is left with the presence of the skull ridge. Because neither ''[[Australopithecus]]'' nor ''[[Pan (genus)|Pan]]'' had the skull ridge, it has been concluded that this feature is unique to ''Homo''. &lt;ref name="Lieberman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lieberman|first=Daniel|author2=Bramble, Dennis |author3=Raichlen, David |author4= Shea, John |title=Brains, Brawn, and the Evolution of Human Endurance Running Capabilities|journal=Contributions from the Third Stony Brook Human Evolution Symposium and Workshop|date=October 2006|pages=77–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the nuchal ligament is only activated while running, the amount of running can be inferred from the muscle markings. In the case of Homo Erectus and Neanderthals, very strong nuchal ligament markings are present, but are less marked in modern humans, indicating a decrease in running behavior &lt;ref name="Lieberman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lieberman|first=Daniel|author2=Bramble, Dennis |author3=Raichlen, David |author4= Shea, John |title=Brains, Brawn, and the Evolution of Human Endurance Running Capabilities|journal=Contributions from the Third Stony Brook Human Evolution Symposium and Workshop|date=October 2006|pages=77–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Nuchal Ligament of Homo Sapien.jpg| thumb|Nuchal ligament of ''Homo sapiens'']]

'''Shoulder and head stabilization:''' The human skeleton is different from early hominins as there is less of a connection between the [[pectoral girdle]] parts of the shoulders and upper back and head, which would be advantageous for climbing but would hinder the movements of the upper body needed to counter leg movement and therefore stabilize the body and head when running. This stabilization is unnecessary in walking.

'''Limb length and mass:''' ''Homo'' has longer legs relative to body mass, which helps to decrease the energetic costs of running, as time in contact with the ground increases.&lt;ref name=number8 /&gt; There is also a decrease in mass of distal parts of limbs of humans, which is known to decrease metabolic costs in endurance running, but has little effect on walking.&lt;ref name=number8 /&gt; Additionally, the mass of the upper body limbs in ''Homo'' has decreased considerably, relative to total body mass, which is important to reduce the effort of stabilizing the arms in running.

'''Joint surface:''' Humans have evolved to absorb great shock and force on the skeletal structure while running. The impact force on the body can reach up to 3-4 times body weight in endurance running, putting the skeletal structure under great stress. To reduce this stress humans have increased joint surfaces relative to body mass to spread force over larger surface areas, particularly in the lower body.&lt;ref name=number8 /&gt; This adaptation, which allows humans to absorb great shock and force applied to the skeleton, is not seen in australopithecine skeletal structures.

'''Plantar arch:''' The [[plantar arch]] in the human foot has an elastic spring function that generates energy for running but not walking.&lt;ref name=number8 /&gt; Fossils of the australopithecine foot show only partial arch, suggesting less of a spring capacity. For the plantar arch spring mechanism to function fully, there must also be restricted rotation in the hind and front parts of the foot. This restriction comes from projected toe bone and compacted mid-foot joint structures in humans, which does not become present until ''Homo habilis''.&lt;ref name=number8 /&gt;

'''Calcaneal tuber and Achilles tendon:''' Studies have explored the calcaneal tuber, the posterior half of the calcaneus bone, as a correlate for [[Achilles tendon]] length and have found correlation between calcaneal tuber length and Achilles tendon length. Because shorter calcaneal tuber length leads to greater Achilles stretch, more kinetic energy is converted to elastic energy, translating into better overall [[running economy]]. Comparisons between Neanderthals and modern humans reveal that this adaptation was absent in Neanderthals, leading researchers to conclude that endurance running capabilities may have been enhanced in anatomically modern humans.&lt;ref name="Raichlen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raichlen|first=D.A.|author2=Armstrong, H |author3=Lieberman, D.E. |title=Calcaneus length determines running economy: Implications for endurance running performance in modern humans and Neandertals.|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=26 January 2011|volume=60|pages=299–308|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmet/21269660|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.11.002|pmid=21269660}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Calcaneus anatomy.jpg|Calcaneus 
&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''Shorter toes:''' Human toes are straight and extremely short in relation to body size compared to other animals. In running, the toes support 50 to 75% of body mass in humans. [[Impulse (physics)|Impulse]] and mechanical work increase in humans as toe length increases, showing that it is energetically favorable to have shorter toes. The costs of shorter toes are decreased gripping capabilities and power output. However, the efficiency benefits seem to outweigh these costs, as the toes of ''A. afarensis'' remains were shorter than great apes, but 40% longer than modern humans, meaning that there is a trend toward shorter toes as the primate species moves away from tree-dwelling. This 40% increase in toe length would theoretically induce a flexor impulse 2.5 times that of modern humans, which would require twice as much mechanical work to stabilize.&lt;ref name="Rolian"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rolian|first=Campbell|author2=Lieberman, Daniel |author3=Hamill, Joseph |author4=Scott, John |author5= Werbel, William |title=Walking, running and the evolution of short toes in humans|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|date=November 2008|pages=212, 713–721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stabilization===
'''Semicircular canal:''' The [[semicircular canal]], a series of three interconnected tubes within each ear, is important for sensing angular rotations of the head and thus plays a crucial role in maintaining balance and sensing and coordinating movement. Comparative studies have shown that animals with larger semicircular canals are able to sense a greater range of head movements and therefore have greater speed and agility. Evolutionarily, greatly reduced semicircular canal diameters are evident in Neanderthals but expanded in modern humans, suggesting that this adaptation was selected for in response to increased endurance running.&lt;ref name=Raichlen /&gt;

'''Vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VORs):''' [[Vestibulo-ocular reflex|VORs]] are enabled by muscles in the eye, which sense angular accelerations of the head and adjust eye movements to stabilize these images. This was an important adaptation for running because it allowed ''Homo'' to see more clearly during the rough pitching motion that occurs during running.&lt;ref name=Lieberman /&gt;

'''Gluteals:''' The [[gluteus maximus]] in ''Homo erectus'' is significantly larger than that of ''Australopithecus''. It is suited to stabilize the trunk while running, but gluteals of that size and strength are not necessary for walking.

'''Iliac spine:''' ''Homo'' has expanded areas on the sacrum and posterior iliac spine for greater muscle attachment. These areas are used to stabilize the trunk and reduce the body's forward pitch caused by running strides.

===Increased efficiency===
==== Thermoregulation ====
{{further|Thermoregulation}}
In addition to advances in skeletal structure and stabilization, adaptations that led to increased efficiency in dissipation of heat were instrumental in the evolution of endurance running in ''Homo''.&lt;ref name="Carrier" /&gt; The duration for which an animal can run is determined by its capacity to release more heat than is produced to avoid lethal temperatures.

The majority of mammals, including humans, rely on evaporative cooling to maintain body temperature. Most medium-to-large mammals rely on panting, while humans rely on [[perspiration|sweating]], to dissipate heat. Advantages to panting include cooler skin surface, little salt loss, and heat loss by forced convection instead of reliance on wind or other means of convection. On the other hand, sweating is advantageous in that evaporation occurs over a much larger surface area (the skin), and it is independent of respiration, thus is a much more flexible mode of cooling during intense activity such as running. Because human sweat glands are under a higher level of neuronal control than those of other species, they allow for the excretion of more sweat per unit surface area than any other species. Heat dissipation of later hominins was also enhanced by the reduction in body hair.&lt;ref name="Carrier"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carrier|first=D.R.|title=The Energetic Paradox of Human Running and Hominid Evolution|journal=Current Anthropology|date=Aug–Oct 1984|volume=25|issue=4|pages=483–495|jstor=2742907|doi=10.1086/203165|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; By ridding themselves of an insulating fur coat, running humans are better able to dissipate the heat generated by exercise.

In addition to improved thermoregulation, hominins have evolved an enhanced method of respiration consistent with the demands of running. Due to their orientation, respiration in quadrupedal mammals is affected by skeletal and muscular stresses generated through the motion of running. The bones and muscles of the chest cavity are not only responsible for shock absorption, but are also subjected to continuous compression and expansion during the running cycle. Because of this movement, quadrupeds are restricted to one breath per locomotor cycle, and thus must coordinate their running gait and respiration rate.&lt;ref name=Carrier /&gt; This tight coordination then translates into another restriction: a specific running speed that is most energetically favorable. The upright orientation of bipedal hominins, however, frees them from this respiration-gait restriction. Because their chest cavities are not directly compressed or involved in the motion of running, hominins are able to vary their breathing patterns with gait.&lt;ref name=Carrier /&gt; This flexibility in respiration rate and running gait contributes to hominins having a broader range of energetically favorable running speeds.

==== Storage and utilization of energy ====
During periods of prolonged exercise, animals are dependent on a combination of two sources of fuel: [[glycogen]] stored in the muscles and liver, and fat. Because glycogen is more easily oxidized than fat, it is depleted first. However, over longer periods of time, energy demands require that fat stores be utilized as fuel. This is true for all mammals, but hominins, and later modern humans, have an advantage of being able to alter their diet to meet these prolonged energy demands.

In addition to flexibility in the utilization of energy, hominins have evolved larger [[thyroid]] and [[adrenal]] glands which enable them to utilize the energy in carbohydrates and fatty acids more readily and efficiently. These organs are responsible for releasing hormones including epinephrine, norepinephrine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), glucagon, and thyroxine. Larger glands allows for greater production of these key hormones and ultimately, maximized utilization of stored fuel.&lt;ref name=Carrier /&gt;

Taken together, the flexibility in diet and the enhanced usage of fuel heightens the previously mentioned finding that, unlike quadrupeds, hominins do not have a single energetically optimal running speed. For quadrupeds, increasing running speed means increasing the demand for oxygen and fuel. Due to skeletal structure and bipedalism, hominins are free to run energetically over a broader range of speeds and gaits, while maintaining a constant energy consumption rate of approximately 4.1&amp;nbsp;MJ per 15&amp;nbsp;km. Thus their utilization of energy is greatly enhanced.&lt;ref name=Carrier /&gt;

==Endurance running and scavenging==
All of the aforementioned adaptations enabled Homo to scavenge for food more effectively. Endurance running could have been used as a means of gaining access to distant carcasses or food stores faster than other scavengers and/or carnivores. Scavenging may have taken one or both of two forms: Opportunistic scavenging and strategic scavenging.

Early Homo almost certainly scavenged opportunistically. Scavenging is considered opportunistic when one "come[s] across carcasses in the course of [their] daily foraging activities".&lt;ref name=Lieberman /&gt;

Strategic scavenging involves a planned search for carcasses. This style of scavenging would have benefitted from endurance running much more than opportunistic scavenging. Strategic scavenging would have involved the use of long range cues, such as birds circling overhead. Endurance running would have been advantageous in this setting because it allowed hominins to reach the carcass more quickly. Selection pressures would have been very high for strategic scavenging, because hominins were diurnal, while their major competitors (hyenas, lions, etc.) were not. Thus, they would have had to make sure to capitalize on daytime carcasses. Selection pressure also came from the weakness of Homo. Because they were very weak, they were unlikely to drive off any large competition at the carcass. This fact led to an even higher need for a way to reach the carcass before these competitors.&lt;ref name=Lieberman /&gt;

==Endurance running and persistence hunting==
[[Persistence hunting]] is "a form of pursuit hunting in which [the hunter uses] endurance running during the midday heat to drive [prey] into [[hyperthermia]] and exhaustion so they can easily be killed".&lt;ref name="Carrier" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lieberman /&gt; Many question persistence hunting's plausibility when bow and arrow and other technologies were so much more efficient. However, in the Early Stone Age (ESA), spears were only sharpened wood, and hominins had not begun using tools. The lack of spearheads or bows meant they could only hunt from very close range—between 6 and 10 meters.&lt;ref name="Churchill"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Churchill|first=S.E.|title=Weapon technology, prey size selection and hunting methods in modern hunter gatherers: implications for hunting in the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]]|journal=Archeological Papers of the American Anthropological Association|year=1993|issue=4|pages=11–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hominins thus must have developed a way to stab prey from close range without causing serious bodily harm to themselves. Persistence hunting makes killing an animal easier by first bringing it to exhaustion, so that it can no longer retaliate violently.

Persistence hunters work by hunting in the middle of the day, when it is hottest. Hunters choose a single target prey and chase it at a speed between its trot and gallop, which is extremely inefficient for the animal. The hunter then continues pursuing over a period of hours, during which he may lose sight of the animal. In this case, the hunter must use tracks and an understanding of the animal to continue the chase. The prey eventually overheats and becomes unable to continue fleeing. Homo, which does not overheat as quickly because of its superior thermoregulation capabilities, is then able to stab the prey while it is incapacitated and cannot attack.

===Tracking===
Due to the complexity of following a fleeing animal, tracking methods must have been a prerequisite for the use of endurance running in persistence hunting. Scientists posit that early tracking methods were developed in open, sparsely vegetated terrain such as the [[Kalahari Desert]] in southern Africa. This "systemic tracking" involves simply following the footprints of animals and was most likely used for tracking grassland species on soft terrain. Skeletal remains suggest that during the Middle Stone Age, hominins used systemic tracking to scavenge for medium-sized animals in vegetation cover, but for hunting antelope in more open grasslands. From the Middle Stone Age into the Later Stone Age, tracking methods developed into what is termed "speculative tracking". When tracks could not easily be found and followed, ''Homo'' predicted where tracks were most likely to be found and interpreted other signs to locate prey.&lt;ref name="Liebenberg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liebenberg|first=Louis|title=Persistence Hunting by Modern Hunter-Gatherers|journal=Current Anthropology|date=December 2006|volume=47|issue=6|pages=1017–1026|jstor=10.1086/508695|doi=10.1086/508695}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This advanced method of tracking allowed for the exploitation of prey in a variety of terrains, making endurance running for persistence hunting more plausible.

===Examples of persistence hunters===
Although exact dates and methods of persistence hunting are difficult to study, several recent accounts of persistence hunting have been recorded. Tribes in the Kalahari Desert in Botswana have been known to employ endurance running to scavenge and hunt prey. In the open country, the !Xo and /Gwi tribes run down slow-moving animals such as aardvark and porcupines, while during the hotter part of the day, they target animals such as [[Common eland|eland]], [[kudu]], [[gemsbok]], [[hartebeest]], [[duiker]], [[steenbok]], [[cheetah]], [[caracal]], and [[African wildcat]]s. In addition to these existing African tribes, it has been suggested that the [[Tarahumara people]] in Mexico and the [[Southern Paiute|Paiute people]] and [[Navajo people|Navajo]] in the American Southwest, used persistence hunting to capture prey including deer and pronghorn. The [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigines]] in Australia are known to have hunted kangaroo in similar ways.&lt;ref name=Liebenberg /&gt;  Due to the increased availability of weapons, nutrition, tracking devices, and motor vehicles, one may argue that persistence hunting is no longer an effective method of hunting animals for food. However, there are examples of the practice occurring in modern times: the !Xo and /Gwi in the central Kalahari, still practice persistence hunting and have developed advanced methods of doing so. Similarly, the Russian [[Lykov family]] that lived in isolation for 40 years also used persistence hunting due to a lack of weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/For-40-Years-This-Russian-Family-Was-Cut-Off-From-Human-Contact-Unaware-of-World-War-II-188843001.html |title=For 40 Years, This Russian Family Was Cut Off From All Human Contact, Unaware of World War II &amp;#124; History &amp;#124; Smithsonian |publisher=Smithsonianmag.com |date=2013-01-28 |accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Gemsbok photo.jpg|[[Gemsbok]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Seasonal differences===
In particular, these two tribes maximize the efficiency of persistence hunting by targeting specific species during different seasons. In the rainy season, prime targets include steenbok, duiker, and gemsbok, as wet sand opens their hooves and stiffens their joints. Hunting in the early rainy season is particularly advantageous because dry leaves form "rocks" in the animals' stomachs, resulting in diarrhea. Stiff joints and suboptimal digestion make the prey weaker and more available targets. In contrast, in the dry season, hunters run down kudu, eland, and red hartebeest because these species tire more easily in the loose sand. Hunters say that the best time to practice persistence hunting is near the end of the dry season when animals are poorly nourished and therefore more easily run to exhaustion.&lt;ref name=Liebenberg /&gt;  By targeting the most vulnerable prey during each season, the hunters maximize the advantages of endurance running.

===Conditions/parameters===
# Persistence hunting must be performed during the day when it is hot, so that the animal will overheat.
# ''Homo'' must have been able to track the animal, as they would have lost sight of it during the chase.
# Such a long hunt requires high amounts of dietary sources of water, salt, and [[glycogen]].
# Although the success rate of recorded persistence hunts is very high (approximately 50%&lt;ref name=Lieberman /&gt;), unsuccessful hunts are very costly. Therefore, there would have had to be a social system in which individuals share food, so unsuccessful hunters could borrow food from others when necessary.

==In culture and folklore==
In the oral traditions of the [[Hadza people|Hadza]], an isolated [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|aboriginal]] people of [[hunter-gatherers]] living in [[Tanzania]], the ''Tlaatlanebe'' in their folk history's second [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] practiced this.

In the first epoch, the world was inhabited by large hairy humanoids called ''Akakaanebe'' ("ancestors"), who did not yet possess tools or fire. They simply "stared" at game until it fell dead, referring to either [[scavenging]] or early [[persistence hunting]] without weapons, or a combination of the two. They did not build houses but slept under trees.

The Tlaatlanebe of the second epoch, however, were large but without hair and lived in caves. As animals had grown more wary of humans due to earlier hunting, they now had to be chased and hunted with dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ndagala|first=D. K.|last2=Zengu|first2=N.|title=Who needs the past?: indigenous values and archaeology|year=1994|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-09558-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7TPIDL9RdsoC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=From+the+raw+to+the+cooked:+Hadzabe+perceptions+of+their+past#v=onepage&amp;q=From%20the%20raw%20to%20the%20cooked%3A%20Hadzabe%20perceptions%20of%20their%20past&amp;f=false|editor=Robert Layton|chapter=From the raw to the cooked: Hadzabe perceptions of their past|pages=51–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
While there is evidence supporting selection on human morphology to improve endurance running ability, there is some dispute over whether the ecological benefits of scavenging and persistence hunting foraging behaviors were the driving force behind this development.

The majority of the arguments opposing persistence hunting and scavenging behaviors are linked to the fact that the paleohabitat and [[paleoecology]] of early ''Homo'' were not conducive to these behaviors. It is thought that the earliest members of ''Homo'' lived in African savanna-woodlands.&lt;ref name=number9 /&gt; This environment consisted of open grassland, as well as parts with dense vegetation—an intermediate between forest and open savannas. The presence of such tree covering would reduce visibility and so require tracking skills. This causes problems for the hypothesis of persistence hunting and running to aid scavenging.

===Against persistence hunting===

[[Ungulates]] are known from archaeological evidence to have been the main prey of the early ''Homo'', and given their great speed, they would have easily been able to outrun early hominins. Ungulate speed, coupled with the variable visibility of the savanna-woodland, meant that hunting by endurance running required the ability to track prey. Pickering and Bunn argue that tracking is part of a sophisticated cognitive skill set that early hominins would not have had, and that even if they were following a trail of blood left by an injured ungulate—which may have been in their cognitive capacity—the ability to craft penetrating projectile technology was absent in early hominins.&lt;ref name="number9"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pickering|first=Travis Rayne|author2=Bunn, Henry|title=The endurance running hypothesis and hunting and scavenging in savanna-woodlands|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=October 2007|volume=53|issue=4|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.01.012|pages=434–438|pmid=17720224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that modern hunters in Africa do not use persistence hunting as a foraging method, and most often give up a chase where the trail they were following ends in vegetation.&lt;ref name=number9 /&gt; The rare groups of hunters who do occasionally participate in persistence hunting are able to do so because of the extremely hot and open environments. In these groups, a full day of rest and recovery is required after a hunt, indicating the great toll persistence hunts take on the body, making them rare undertakings.&lt;ref name=number9 /&gt;

Finally, in critique of Liebenberg's research on modern day persistence hunting, it was revealed that the majority of the hunts initiated were prompted for filming rather than spontaneous, and that few of these hunts were successful. The hunts that were successful involved external factors such as the hunters being able to stop and refill water bottles.&lt;ref name=number9 /&gt;

A response to these criticisms has been formulated by Lieberman et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The evolution of endurance running and the tyranny of ethnography: A reply to Pickering and Bunn (2007)|url=http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3743587/2007i.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting that it is unclear how humans could have grown to occupy a new niche as a diurnal social carnivore without persistence hunting, as the weapons preferred in modern hunter-gatherer tribes would not have been available at the time.

===Against scavenging===
The proposed benefit of endurance running in scavenging is the ability of early hominins to outcompete other scavengers in reaching food sources.&lt;ref name=number9 /&gt; However paleoanthropological studies suggest that the savanna-woodland habitat caused a very low competition environment. Due to low visibility, carcasses were not easily located by mammalian carnivores, resulting in less competition.

'''Gina Kaus''' (born '''Regina Wiener'''; 21 October 1893, [[Vienna, Austria]] – 23 December 1985, [[Los Angeles, California]]) was an Austrian-American novelist and screenwriter.

==Life and career==
Regina Wiener, the daughter of money broker Max Wiener, attended an all-girls school. Regina married the Viennese musician Josef Zirner in 1913, but he died in 1915 on the battlefield in World War I. She was the mistress and common law wife of the banker Josef Kranz and used the last name Zirner-Kranz. Four years later, 1920, she married the writer Otto Kaus, but the couple divorced in 1926, after the birth of two sons, [[Otto Kaus]], a [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]] Associate Justice, and Peter.

In the twenties, Gina Kaus published her first novel ''The Rise'', which won the Theodor Fontane Prize, and was very active in the circle of  literary intellectuals in Berlin and Vienna. She had friendships with both Austrian writers [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] and a romance with Otto Soyka; in her autobiography she would write "... I had a lover, I am not loved." In 1933 she would watch both their books fall victim to the [[Nazi book burnings]].

In March 1938, Kaus moved from Vienna via Zurich to Paris. In Paris she wrote two screenplays from her play ''Gefängnis ohne Gitter'' and her novel ''Die Schwestern Kleeh'', which became the popular movies ''Prison sans barreaux'' and ''[[Conflict (1938 film)|Conflict]]'', both starring [[Corinne Luchaire]]. Later the same year ''Prison sans barreaux'' was remade into the British film ''[[Prison Without Bars]]'' with Luchaire reprising her original part. One year later ''Prison Without Bars'' was shown as a [[BBC Television|BBC]] live television broadcast with [[Nova Pilbeam]] in the leading role.&lt;ref&gt;http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/a1b30ce213504b958b1d18ae61394ced&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939, Gina Kaus emigrated to the United States. After a few months in New York, she settled in Hollywood in November 1939. She wrote many scripts there and would not return to Vienna until 1948 and visit Berlin until 1951.

In 1956. Kaus's 1940 novel ''Devil Next Door'' was made into the film ''[[Devil in Silk]]'' by director [[Rolf Hansen (director)|Rolf Hansen]], starring [[Lilli Palmer]] and [[Curt Jürgens]].

In 1979, Kaus wrote an autobiography published in Germany as ''Und was für ein Leben...mit Liebe und Literatur, Theater und Film''.

Gina Kaus wrote some of her works under the [[pseudonym]], "Andreas Eckbrecht".

She died in Los Angeles in 1985.

Her grandson is pundit [[Mickey Kaus]].

In 1897, Kanyasulkam was published (by [[Vavilla Ramaswamy Sastrulu and Sons]], Madras) and was dedicated to Maharaja Ananda Gajapati. Gurajada Appa Rao (along with brother Syamala Rao) had written several English poems. His [[Sarangadhara]], published in "Indian Leisure Hour" was well received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/call-to-propagate-works-of-gurajada-appa-rao/article3853844.ece|title=Call to propagate works of Gurajada Appa Rao|first=Staff|last=Reporter|date=3 September 2012|publisher=|via=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editor of the Calcutta-based "Rees and Ryot" Sambhu Chandra Mukherji read it and re-published it in his magazine. ''Gundukurti Venkata Ramanayya'', editor of the "Indian Leisure Hour" encouraged Gurazada greatly during the same period. In 1891, Gurajada was appointed to the post of [[Epigraphist]] to the Maharaja of Vizianagaram.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Gurazada was born on 21 September 1862 at his maternal uncle's home in Rayavaram village, near [[Yelamanchili]],   [[Visakhapatnam district]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; in a [[Brahmin]] family. His parents were Venkata Rama Dasu and Kausalyamma. Gurajada lived most of his life in and around [[Vizianagaram]] in what was then called as Kalinga Rajyam. He and his father before him were both employed by the princely state of [[Vizianagaram]]. Gurazada enjoyed a close relationship with the ruling family during his adult life.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
Gurazada had his initial schooling in [[Cheepurupalli]] while his father was working there. His remaining schooling was done at Vizianagaram after his father died. During that time, he was taken care of by the then M.R. College Principal, C. Chandrasekhara Sastri who provided him free lodging and boarding. He completed his matriculation in 1882 and obtained F.A. in 1884. Soon after, he was employed as a teacher in M.R. High School in 1884 with a salary of Rs.25.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In 1887, Gurajada spoke at a Congress Party meeting in Vizianagaram. His daughter Voleti Lakshmi Narasamma was born in 1887. He was simultaneously involved in social work and became a member of the Voluntary Service Corps in Visakhapatnam in 1888. He was elected vice-president of the Ananda Gajapati Debating club in 1889. His son Gurazada Venkata Ramadasu was born in 1890. In 1891 he was promoted to Lecturer (Level III) with a salary of Rs.125. He taught the F.A. and B.A. classes several subjects including English Grammar, Sanskrit Literature, Translation, Greek and Roman Histories. His younger brother Syamala Rao died in 1892 while studying at Madras Law College.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

=== 1908 Congress session at Madras ===
In 1911, he was appointed to the Board of Studies by [[Madras University]]. The same year, Gurajada and his friends started the ''Andhra Sahitya Parishat'' to promote use of spoken dialects. The next year, he was invited to attend the meeting of the Bangeeya Sahitya Parishat (Bengal Literary Association) at Calcutta.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Retirement and death ==
GuraZada took retirement in 1913, the then [[Madras University]] honored him with the title "Emeritus Fellow".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  Gurazada Apparao died on 30 November 1915.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

=== Kanyasulkam ===
[[File:Gurajada Apparao house 06.jpg|thumb|120px|Gurazada Apparao house (presently used as a memorial library) in Vizianagaram, Andhra Pradesh]]
[[File:Poetic lines by Gurazada Apparao garu.jpg|thumb|120px|Poetic lines by Sri Gurazada Apparao garu]]
''Kanyasulkam'' is about the deplorable condition of widows in traditional [[Brahmin]] families in the [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]] region of [[India]] during the 19th century. The play is a highly thought-provoking social drama dealing with social issues relevant to the time. Gurajada Apparao was deeply troubled by the double standards, hypocrisy and social inequalities in the Indian society. The English preface to the first edition of his play states: "Such a scandalous state of things is a disgrace to society, and literature can not have a higher function than to show up such practices and give currency to a high standard of moral ideas.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Until reading habits prevail among masses, one must look only to the stage to exert such healthy influence." Perhaps for the first time in Telugu literary history, a [[prostitute]] was given a very positive image so much so that she is shown to better the lives of many people during the course of the play. The play is ageless in the sense that its projection of the Indian mindset and psyche is very relevant and applicable in Indian Society today. The play was in some ways way ahead of its time and was very bold in criticizing the popular opinions and practices during that era. It frequently jabs at the male-dominated society of India, by bringing to the forefront certain egoistic idiosyncrasies of a typical Indian male, in an unflattering manner. It also questions the practices of [[witchcraft]], sorcery, and their popular usage in medical practice during that period in India.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Life History of Gurazada Apparao garu.jpg|thumb|120px|Life History of Gurazada Apparao garu displayed at his house, which is used as a memorial library now]]
He was married to Appala Narasamma in 1885. In the mean time, he continued his studies and graduated with B.A. (Philosophy major and Sanskrit minor) in 1886. For some period during 1886, he worked as Head Clerk in the Deputy Collector's office. On Vijayadasami day, 1887, he joined as a Lecturer (Level IV) in ''M.R. College'' with a salary of Rs.100. Around the same time, he was introduced to Maharajah [[Pusapati Ananda Gajapati Raju]] (1850–1897).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In 1905, Gurajada's mother died. In 1906, his close friend P.T. Srinivasa Iyyangar, principal of Mrs. A.V.N. College, Visakhapatnam started an association to promote curriculum reform in high schools. One of the chief aims was to introduce spoken dialects. Along with him, J.A. Yates (1874–1951) -a British civil servant, Gidugu and Gurajada were the principal members. Another friend [[S. Srinivasa Iyengar]] (1874–1941) also gave a lot of support and encouragement. Incidentally, this Srinivasa Iyengar was a well-known lawyer and was the President of AICC (All India Congress Committee) annual session at Guwahati in 1926. Gurajada's childhood friend and classmate in Chipurupalli, [[Gidugu Rammurty]] (1863–1940) was his school of thought.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

'''Hernán Valdés''' (born 1934) is a [[Chile]]an writer, best known for his book ''{{ill|Tejas Verdes: Journal of a Concentration Camp in Chile|es|Tejas Verdes: diario de un campo de concentración en Chile|lt=Tejas Verdes}}'', the first published account of the repression carried out by the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|military dictatorship]] led by General [[Augusto Pinochet]].

==Biography==
As a writer, Valdés began publishing poetry – his first book appeared in 1954 – but he then moved on to prose. His first novel, ''Cuerpo creciente'', saw the light in 1966, and won the [[Santiago Municipal Literature Award]] the following year.&lt;ref name=Municipal&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=emFdAAAAMAAJ |title=Antología crítica de la poesía chilena: Modernidad, marginalidad y fragmentación urbana (1953–1973) |trans-title=Critical Anthology of Chilean Poetry: Modernity, Marginalitty, and Urban Fragmentation (1953–1973) |first=Naín |last=Nómez |publisher=[[LOM Ediciones]] |page=545 |language=Spanish |year=2006 |access-date=24 April 2018 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valdés studied film in [[Prague]] in the 1960s. He lived a couple of years in [[Paris]], and in 1970 he returned to Chile by sea. [[Pablo Neruda]] was also traveling on the ship and Valdés brought the originals of his second novel: ''Zoom''.&lt;ref name=comisión&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://diario.elmercurio.com/detalle/index.asp?id={a0ea8cfc-fd8c-4458-a63e-b14acaebbec8} |title=La comisión debe reparar sus omisiones |trans-title=The Commission Must Repair its Omissions |first=María Teresa |last=Cárdenas |work=[[El Mercurio]] |language=Spanish |date=5 February 2005 |access-date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left in 1971, under the [[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]] government, and it would be the last work he published in Chile before departing for exile.

After Pinochet's [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|coup d'état]], on 12 February 1974, armed civilian agents entered his apartment in [[Santiago]] in search of [[Miguel Enríquez (politician)|Miguel Enríquez]], leader of the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|Revolutionary Left Movement]] (MIR). Although they were mistaken – Valdés declared that he did not know anyone from the MIR – he was arrested and admitted the following day to the prison camp of Tejas Verdes ([[Llolleo]]), where he was tortured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://diario.latercera.com/edicionimpresa/hernan-valdes-los-escritores-en-chile-son-cursis-y-les-falta-humor/ |title=Hernán Valdés: 'Los escritores en Chile son cursis y les falta humor' |trans-title=Hernán Valdés: 'Writers in Chile are Corny and Lack Humor' |first=Javier |last=García |work=[[La Tercera]] |language=Spanish |date=22 July 2012 |access-date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valdés spent a month in Tejas Verdes, and when he was released, he sought asylum at the Swedish embassy. In May of that year he arrived in [[Barcelona]], and a few days later began to write what would become ''Tejas Verdes: Journal of a Concentration Camp in Chile'', "the best story that exists about the pain of a subject put through military humiliation in the first months of the dictatorship."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://critica.cl/literatura-chilena/ficcion-y-referente-historico-la-narrativa-de-hernan-valdes |title=Ficción y Referente Histórico.

The Narrative of Hernán Valdés. |first=Ricardo |last=Cuadros |work=Crítica.cl |language=Spanish |date=8 June 2005 |access-date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his testimonial book – published the same year in Spain, but only be published in Chile 22 years later, in 1996 – Valdés returned to fiction and wrote other novels. ''A partir del fin'', focused on the military coup of 1973, came out in Mexico in 1981 (in Chile, also 22 years later).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.letras.s5.com/hv1712051.htm |title=A partir del Fin: una reflexión perpleja del Golpe |trans-title=A partir del Fin: A Perplexed Reflection on the Coup |first=Roberto |last=Careaga Catenacci |work=[[El Mostrador]] |language=Spanish |date=15 March 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816222749/http://www.letras.s5.com/hv1712051.htm |archive-date=16 August 2016 |dead-url=yes |access-date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La historia subyacente'', published in German in 1984, appeared in Spanish, in Chile, in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://diario.elmercurio.com/detalle/index.asp?id={f0f56cc6-27c8-4385-a42a-c6b507cd74d2} |title=Publican novela alemana de Hernán Valdés |trans-title=German Novel of Hernán Valdés Published |first=José |last=Promis |work=[[El Mercurio]] |language=Spanish |date=22 July 2007 |access-date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On ''A partir del fin'', María Teresa Cárdenas (''[[El Mercurio]]'') has said that "if there is any literary justice, it should be recognized as the great novel about the military coup."&lt;ref name=comisión/&gt;

Hernán Valdés is based in [[Kassel]], Germany, after having lived for a long time in Spain and England.&lt;ref name=Altazor&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.premioaltazor.cl/hernan-valdes-fantasmas-literarios/ |title=Hernán Valdés |publisher=[[Altazor Award]] |language=Spanish |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519132153/http://www.premioaltazor.cl/hernan-valdes-fantasmas-literarios/ |archive-date=19 May 2014 |dead-url=yes |access-date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5639">A '''hospitality service''', also known as "accommodation sharing", "hospitality exchange" (short "hospex"), "home stay network", or "home hospitality network" ("hoho"), is a centrally organized [[social networking service]] of travelers who offer or seek [[homestay]]s ([[lodging]] in a home) either gratis or for [[money]]. Hospitality services generally connect users via the [[internet]] and are examples of [[collaborative consumption]] and [[sharing]]. In cases where lodging is offered gratis, they are examples of a [[barter economy]] or [[gift economy]]. A hospitality service may collect [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]]s on each homestay, charge a membership fee, or be completely free.

==History==
In 1949, Bob Luitweiler founded [[Servas International]], the first hospitality service, as a volunteer-run international [[nonprofit organization]] advocating interracial and international peace.

In 1953, several European teachers who wanted to travel internationally during their summer breaks founded [[Intervac International]], a [[home exchange]] network.

In 1965, John Wilcock set up the Traveler's Directory as a listing of his friends willing to host each other when traveling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yX-ky6Mc8qQC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100 | title=You Can Travel Free | first=Robert William | last=Kirk | publisher=[[Pelican Publishing Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, Joy Lily rescued the organization from imminent shutdown, forming Hospitality Exchange.

In 1966, psychologist [[Rubén Feldman González]] created Programo Pasporto, a hospitality service for [[Esperanto]] speakers in [[Argentina]]. In 1974, with the help of Jeanne-Marie Cash, it became [[Pasporta Servo]] and published its first membership directory, which listed 40 hosts.

In 1971, Sue Coppard founded [[WWOOF]] ("Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms"), a network in which food, lodging, and education is provided to guests in exchange for [[housekeeping]] and [[farmworker]] services.

In 1977, Presbyterian minister Wayne Smith and U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] established [[Friendship Force International]], with the mission of improving [[intercultural relations]], [[cultural diplomacy]], [[friendship]], and [[intercultural competence]] via organized trips involving homestays.

In 1992, Hospex.org became the first internet-only hospitality service; it later was folded into [[Hospitality Club]], created in 2000 by Veit Kühne.

In 2004, Casey Fenton founded [[CouchSurfing]], the largest hospitality service in which accommodation is offered gratis.

In 2008, [[Brian Chesky]] and [[Joe Gebbia]] founded [[Airbnb]] after a popular conference made it hard to find accommodation. Hosts receive monetary payment from guests, paid online in advance, and Airbnb receives commissions from each transaction.

Sir '''Ifor Williams''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (16 April 1881 – 4 November 1965) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] scholar who laid the foundations for the academic study of [[Old Welsh]], particularly early Welsh poetry.

Ifor Williams was born at [[Pendinas]], [[Tregarth]] near [[Bangor, Wales|Bangor]], [[Wales]] the son of John Williams, a quarryman, and his wife Jane. His maternal grandfather, Hugh Derfel Hughes, was a noted local historian who wrote a well-regarded book on the history of the area. He went to [[Friars School, Bangor]], in 1894 but had only been there for just over a year when he suffered a serious accident. This left him with back injuries that made him bedridden for several years.

Having recovered, he attended [[Clynnog Fawr|Clynnog]] School in 1901 and in 1902 won a scholarship to the [[Bangor University]]. In 1905 he graduated with honours in Greek, then in 1906 in [[Welsh (language)|Welsh]]. He spent the 1906–07 academic year at the Department of Welsh working for his M.A. degree and assisting Sir [[John Morris-Jones]], the Professor of Welsh, before being appointed an assistant lecturer. In 1920 a Chair of Welsh Literature was specially created for him, which he held until Sir John Morris-Jones died in 1929, when he became Professor of Welsh Language and Literature.

Ifor Williams had a lifelong interest in Welsh place-names, and was one of the first to apply rigorous academic methods to this field. He published ''Enwau Lleoedd'' ("Place Names") in 1945 which is still of great value today. Many of his early publications were written in order to provide teaching material and included versions with detailed notes of a number of old Welsh tales, notably the ''[[Mabinogi]]'' in 1930. He also produced books giving the text with notes of the works of a number of mediaeval poets such as [[Dafydd ap Gwilym]] and others in 1914 and [[Iolo Goch]] in 1925 with colleagues.

His main field of study however was [[Old Welsh language|Old Welsh]] and the earliest Welsh Poetry. He produced ''Canu Llywarch Hen'' in 1935 covering the poetry associated with [[Llywarch Hen]], then in 1938 possibly his most important work, ''Canu Aneirin'', the text with notes of the [[Y Gododdin|Gododdin]] attributed to the 6th-century poet [[Aneirin]]. For the first time the original text was distinguished from later additions and made comprehensible with notes, and this work has provided the foundation for all subsequent work on this poetry.  He wrote an introduction to ''Canu Taliesin'' in 1960 on work of the poet [[Taliesin]], with particular emphasis on the dating of the 6th century poems in the Taliesin corpus.  The book followed his introduction with a new translation by J.E. Caerwyn Williams. Ifor Williams also published works on later Welsh poetry, such as the 10th century [[Armes Prydein|Armes Prydain]].

Williams edited the ''[[Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies]]'' from 1937 to 1948. He was also a speaker on the radio, and selections of his radio lectures were published in three books. He retired in 1947 and was knighted the same year. In 1949 the [[University of Wales]] awarded him the honorary degree of Ll.D.. He lived between 1913–1947 in Menai Bridge and retired to Pontllyfni where he died in 1965. He is buried in the burial ground attached to Capel Brynaerau, Pontllyfni.

'''Ignatius Behnam Hadliyo''', also known as '''Behnam of Hidl''', was the [[Patriarch of Antioch]], and head of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] from 1445 until his death in 1454.&lt;ref name="Barsoum"&gt;Barsoum (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Behnam, son of John, was born in the village of Hidl (also spelt Hedel), near Esfes, into the Habbo Kanni family, which was originally from the village of Bartulli. He became a monk at the [[Mor Gabriel Monastery|Monastery of Mor Gabriel]] and was later ordained as a priest there. In 1404, Behnam was consecrated as [[Maphrian]], upon which he assumed the name Basilius, and was elevated to [[Patriarch]] of [[Mardin]] as Ignatius on 24 July 1412. Following the death of Patriarch [[Baselius IV Simon]], Behnam convinced the diocese of Antioch to proclaim him as legitimate patriarch and, in 1445, he was consecrated as Patriarch of Antioch. He was a prolific poet and great writer, composing a total of eleven odes.&lt;ref name="Barsoum" /&gt;

'''Khaling''' (kʰɛ̂l brâː ख्या:ल् ब्रा:) is a [[Kiranti languages|Kiranti]] language spoken in [[Solukhumbu district]], [[Nepal]] and in [[India]]. It is one of the few Kiranti languages with tonal contrasts, which are of secondary origin.&lt;ref&gt;Tonogenesis in Khaling in discussed in the following articles:

*Jacques, Guillaume, Aimée Lahaussois, Boyd Michailovsky, and Dhan Bahadur Rai. 2012. An overview of Khaling verbal morphology. 'Language and linguistics' 13.6: 1095–1170. [http://www.ling.sinica.edu.tw/files/publication/j2012_6_03_7314.pdf] 
*Jacques, Guillaume. 2016. Tonogenesis and tonal alternations in Khaling. In Enrique L. Palancar &amp; Jean Léo Léonard (eds.), Tone and Inflection, 41–66. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter. [https://www.academia.edu/10516416/Tonogenesis_and_tonal_alternations_in_Khaling]&lt;/ref&gt;

Khaling has approximately 15,000 speakers and is therefore considered a vulnerable language. Khaling has a complex system of [[stem alternations]]: as many as 10 distinct stems have to be posited for a word (Jacques et al. 2012).  Khaling is very unusual in having an auditory demonstrative (see Jacques and Lahaussois 2014). Khaling is also known as Rai, Khalinge Rai, Khael Bra, and Khael Baat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/4408|title=Did you know Khaling is vulnerable?|website=Endangered Languages|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General information==
Khaling is still being acquired by children who live in Khaling-speaking areas, as well as non-Khaling children who happen to live in that area.

==Geographical distribution==
Khaling is spoken in the following VDC's of Nepal (''[[Ethnologue]]'').

*[[Solukhumbu District]], [[Sagarmatha Zone]]: [[Kaku, Nepal|Kanku]], [[Basa, Nepal|Basa]], [[Baku, Nepal|Waku]], [[Buksa, Nepal|Buksa]], [[Jubing]], and [[Phuleli]] villages

'''Indonesian law affecting Chinese-Indonesians''' were conducted through a series of laws, directives, or constitutions enacted by the [[Government of Indonesia]] that affected the lives of [[Chinese Indonesians]] or [[China|Chinese]] nationals living in Indonesia since the nation's independence. The laws were made against Chinese Indonesians.  Most of these laws are revoked following [[Reformation (Indonesia)|Reformation era]] under president [[Abdurrahman Wahid]].

==1950==
In the early 1950s the Government of Indonesia implemented the [[Benteng program]] (''fortress program''), under which only [[Native Indonesians]] (''pribumi'') were allowed to have licenses to import certain items. This rule gave rise to the term "[[Ali Baba (business)|Ali Baba]]", referring to illicit co-operation between Chinese businessmen and native Indonesians who had connections in the government bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="tempo-menggusur"/&gt;

Presidential Regulation 10 of 1959 ({{lang-id|[[:id:Peraturan Presiden Nomor 10 tahun 1959|Peraturan Presiden Nomor 10 tahun 1959]]}}) was a law directive issued by Indonesian government and signed by Minister of Trade, Rachmat Mujomisero. The law prohibited foreign nationals from doing retail business in rural areas and required them to transfer their businesses to Indonesian nationals by 1 January 1960 or relocate to urban areas. This directive was approved by President [[Sukarno]]. The rule became controversial since its implementation resulting in several people being killed in West Java (also known as racial riot of Cibadak) and triggered a huge exodus of Chinese Indonesians back to China.&lt;ref name="tempo-menggusur"&gt;{{cite news | title = Peraturan yang Menggusur Tionghoa | url = http://majalah.tempointeraktif.com/id/arsip/2007/08/13/LU/mbm.20070813.LU124735.id.html | work = [[Tempo magazine (Indonesia)|Tempo]] | date = 13–19 August 2007 | pages = 94–95 | accessdate = 1 February 2009|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the regulation merely mentioned that only "foreign citizens" were required to do the relocation and closure of business, the law affected many Chinese nationals and Chinese Indonesians. From the 86,690 foreign business retailer listed, about 90 percent of these were Chinese.&lt;ref name="tempo-menggusur"/&gt;

===Background===
Right after the Indonesian Independence in 1945, the Indonesian people was overwhelmed by the euphoria of "freedom" and took over a lot of foreign companies: this action was referred to as "Anti-Dutch sentiment". Among others, one was a Dutch company [[Koninklijke Paketvaart-Maatschappij]] (KPM), a company serving in sea transportation from [[Netherlands]] to Indonesia. Marhaen, a labour group that later on become a political party, took over this company. Other foreign capital seized were oil fields, by the oil labourers claiming themselves as "Laskar Minyak" (The Oil Defenders).&lt;ref name="tempo-nasionalisasi"&gt;{{cite news | title = Nasionalisasi Berakhir Buntung | url = http://majalah.tempointeraktif.com/id/arsip/2007/08/13/LU/mbm.20070813.LU124732.id.html | work = [[Tempo magazine (Indonesia)|Tempo]] | date = 13–19 August 2007 | pages = 88–89 | accessdate = 1 February 2009|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a while, the Government of Indonesia realised that unskilled and inexperienced Indonesians were unable to run the company. The Indonesians, referred to as ''Kaum pribumi'', also did not have enough capital, and it was almost impossible to compete with foreign investment and the Chinese capital (before independence, the ethnic Chinese had more chances to do business from colonialist ruler).&lt;ref name="tempo-nasionalisasi"/&gt; These companies suffer losses after the seizure. As a solution, the Government of Indonesia signed an agreement during [[Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference]] in [[Den Haag]], [[Netherlands]], which stated that the government of Indonesia would return all seized foreign investment assets to its previous owner. In return, to strengthen up the weak Indonesians (pribumi), the Government of Indonesia had the right to issue a law or directive to protect the national interest and those who were "economically feeble".

On 19 March 1956, during Indonesian National Importer Congress in [[Surabaya]] (''Kongres Importir Nasional Indonesia''), [[Assaat|Asaat Datuk Mudo]] made an opening oration that the Chinese had become [[monopoly|monopolistic]] in doing their business by closing all possible entry routes for Indonesian nationals to join the trade market.
{{cquote|The Chinese as an exclusive group refuse other group to enter, specially in economy. They were so exclusive that in their practice they become monopolistic.}}

As a closing statement, Assat also added that he believes this was the time to have a special economy initiative to protect Indonesian (pribumi).&lt;ref name="tempo-menggusur"/&gt;

Asaat's speech became the beginning of "Asaat movement" or "Pro Indonesian (term used was for Indonesian was ''Pribumi'') movement" and had a huge impact on the following rules favouring it. In November 1959, PP Nomor 10 Tahun 1959 was issued.

In the 1950s, almost all retail stores in Indonesia were owned by Chinese or Chinese-Indonesians from grocery stores, hardware stores and even restaurants. Alwi Sahab, a [[Betawi people|Betawi]] culture expert stated that during his youth in Kwitang, Central Jakarta, the economic centre was in Jakarta fully dependent on the Chinese or Chinese Indonesian businessman. {{cquote|Well, if you think there are [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]] Restaurants or other restaurant like now, you really shouldn't, everything was owned by the Chinese then.&lt;ref name="tempo-menggusur"/&gt;}}

===Implementation, protest and counter action===
Tempo magazine investigation published in year 2009 mentioned that during the implementation, the law affected 86,690 foreign retailers listed (90 percent Chinese) to about 500,000 were affected.&lt;ref name="tempo-menggusur"/&gt; However, Waspada Daily in their commemorative anniversary published their story printed in the 1960s during the happening, and it had a different number, according to Waspada Daily only about 25,000 small groceries booths by foreign retailers (mainly) Chinese affected by PP No. 10.&lt;ref name="waspada"&gt;{{id icon}} Berita Peristiwa 60 Tahun Waspada: Penduduk Cina Dipulangkan (1960). PP No.10 dan Masalah Pemulangan Hoakiao Hal 39&lt;/ref&gt;

The sanctions specified in the directive were only property confiscation (all items had to be given to Koperasi),&lt;ref name="waspada"/&gt; fines, and forced relocation, but, in practice, there were also some offenders executed (Cimahi and Cibadak, [[West Java]]&lt;ref name="tempo-menggusur"/&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{id icon}} [http://indonesiamedia.com/rubrik/berta/berta00september-sistemnilai.htm "Sistem Nilai Kita Sudah Dirusak."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218134817/http://www.indonesiamedia.com/rubrik/berta/berta00september-sistemnilai.htm |date=18 February 2008 }} ''Indonesia Media'' online. September 2000. Accessed 25 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some places, the law was enforced by the military. The military shot dead two Chinese women, which triggered a riot in Cimahi, Jawa Barat. It was also noted that the Chinese were forced to leave their home and properties.&lt;ref name="tempo-menggusur"/&gt; However, while, nationwide, the implementation of this law went smoothly,&lt;ref name="waspada"/&gt; in some places like Bandung and Medan, there were Chinese merchants trying to stop the implementation of PP 10 by hiding or emptying the stores and piling the goods in warehouses, causing price increases of main food materials. Specially, after another government directive was issued about price adjustments, according to the Attorney General Special Instruction, in some areas, including North Sumatra, Economic Survaillance Teams were formed to watch certain issues in economy such as stabilising prices and making appropriate actions to everyone who withhold the food program implemented by the government. The Economic Surveillance Team in North Sumatra manage to secure 200 warehouses in Medan consisting of food materials, the merchants being punished by imprisonment.&lt;ref name="waspada"/&gt;

The law was meant to strengthen the national economy in Indonesia, yet this law resulted in a tense diplomatic relation between Republic of Indonesia and the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). During a meeting between State Minister Subandrio and Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia (Huang Chen) in Jakarta, the PRC insisted that PP No. 10 should be reviewed, and the request was denied.&lt;ref name="waspada"/&gt; Later on during a parliamentary hearing, State Minister Subandrio restated that there is no element of anti-Chinese related in the implementation of PP No. 10, the law being solely the beginning of nationalisation and socialisation in the Indonesian economy, and as part of the Indonesian revolution movement. On the nationalisation part, PP No. 10 stated that foreign retailers must be closed outside ''ibukota kabupaten'' and the merchant had to live only in his property, which was not allowed to conduct any business activities. Foreigners had to close their business at the latest on 1 January 1960 and give all their assets to [[Koperasi]].&lt;ref name="waspada"/&gt;

The Government of [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] was upset. On 10 December 1959, [[Peking]] radio announced a campaign for Chinese citizen to return to "The Warmth of Motherland". The [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] Embassy in Jakarta soon listed all Chinese citizens interested in returning to [[China]]. About 199,000 applied, but only 102,000 managed to be placed in a ship sent by the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Terusir dari Kampung Sendiri | url = http://majalah.tempointeraktif.com/id/arsip/2007/08/13/LU/mbm.20070813.LU124736.id.html | work = [[Tempo magazine (Indonesia)|Tempo]] | date = 13–19 August 2007 | pages = 96–97 | accessdate = 1 February 2009|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{id icon}} Arsip. Majalah Tempo 24 November 1990 dimuat pada Majalah Tempo edisi 13-19 Agustus 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The tension between [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] Government and Government of Indonesia reduced after [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] Prime Minister [[Zhou Enlai]] met President [[Soekarno]].

===Pro and cons===
According to Mestika Zed from [[Andalas University]], [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]], [[West Sumatera]], Asaat Datuk Mudo was a real nationalist and always reacted according to facts and reality. The economy of ''pribumi'' (Native Indonesian) after independence was weak with no one defending them. Meanwhile, even during Dutch Imperialism, the Chinese always had a better economy than the ''pribumi''. After Indonesian independence, they took over the economy from small, middle, and large scale. Assaat's ideas were later adopted by [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] and [[Mahathir Mohamad]] as the Malaysian economy policy to protect the majority and indigenous ethnic Malay in [[Malaysia]], which was then faced with a similar economic situation.

From historical perspective, even in the beginning of Indonesian Independence the Chinese was always been suspected because they are divided into three groups: "Pro-Dutch", "Pro-Chinese Government", and "Pro-Indonesian Nationalist Movement". There are also Indonesian Chinese who agree that it was needed to do an [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] or ''pribumisation'' of Indonesian Chinese (also known as the Tionghoa) through religion ([[Islam]] and [[PITI]]) as Moslem organisation. [[Hamka]] for example, is included in this group. They have given their support and chances to Chinese-Indonesians to prove that they want to become a "good Indonesian citizen". There is also a lot of co-operation between the Chinese and the Indonesians noted during Indonesian national movement. Even some of the prominent Chinese figures were trying hard to make the Chinese-Indonesian return to Indonesia. [[Yap Thiam Hien]], a Chinese-Indonesian lawyer, famous for his Indonesian nationalist idealism, established Baperki (Indonesian Citizenship Discussion Body) in 1954. The organisation's purpose was to make Chinese-Indonesians willing to be an Indonesian citizen, specially to those that take side to the Dutch and the Chinese Government. This body also gave a lot of contribution in proposing the Indonesian Citizenship Law 1958, which was implemented on the beginning of 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Thung | first = Ju Lan | title = Empat Masa 'Persoalan Cina' | url = http://majalah.tempointeraktif.com/id/arsip/2007/08/13/LU/mbm.20070813.LU124737.id.html | work = [[Tempo magazine (Indonesia)|Tempo]] | date = 13–19 August 2007 | accessdate = 1 February 2009|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discriminative rule also noted as an attempt to maintain politics of [[divide and rule|divide and conquer]].

Leo Suryadinata, a Chinese-Indonesian now teaching in [[National University of Singapore]] (NUS), thinks that both ''fortress rules'' or PP 10/ 1959 is a beginning anti-Chinese movement in Indonesia. According to Suryadinata, during colonialism by the Dutch, the Chinese-Indonesians were mostly small retailers, but after Indonesian independence, their position was strengthened, which is why ''pribumi'' think that they cannot compete and would like to take over the power by using the government.

==Presidential Decision 240 of 1967==
Presidential Decision 240 of 1967&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coppel|2002|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang|id|Keputusan Presiden Nomor 240 Tahun 1967}}'', Keppres No. 240/1867) mandated assimilation of "foreigners" and supported a previous directive, 127/U/Kep/12/1966, for Indonesian Chinese to adopt Indonesian-sounding names.

==Presidential Instruction 14 of 1967==
{{Wikisourcelang|id|Instruksi Presiden Republik Indonesia Nomor 14 Tahun 1967}}
{{Wikisourcelang|id|Keputusan Presiden Republik Indonesia Nomor 6 Tahun 2000}}
Presidential Instruction No. 14/1967 (Inpres No. 14/1967) on Chinese Religion, Beliefs, and Traditions effectively banned any Chinese literature and cultures in Indonesia, including the prohibition of Chinese characters. Although Chinese names were not explicitly mentioned, "newly naturalized" Indonesian Chinese were strongly advised to adopt non-Chinese names. (Annulled by former president [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] in Keppres No. 6/2000;&lt;ref&gt;Keputusan Presiden Republik Indonesia Nomor 6 Tahun 2000&lt;/ref&gt; annulment supported by former president [[Megawati Soekarnoputri]] in Keppres No 19/2002 by declaring [[Chinese New Year]] as national holiday.)

==1967==
Laws affecting Chinese Indonesians proliferated under the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] regime under former President [[Suharto]]'s reign. Suharto was a strong advocate for Chinese assimilation rather than integration. As part of 1967's 'Basic Policy for the Solution of the Chinese Problem' and other measures, only one Chinese-language newspaper was allowed to continue, all Chinese religious expressions had to be confined to their homes, Chinese-language schools were phased out, Chinese script in public places was banned, and Chinese were encouraged to take on [[Indonesian-sounding names adopted by Chinese Indonesians|Indonesian-sounding names]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schwarz |first=A. |year=1994 |title=A Nation in Waiting: Indonesia in the 1990s |publisher=Westview Press|isbn=1-86373-635-2 |page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of this legislation were revoked following Suharto's fall from power in 1998.

==Ampera Cabinet Presidium Circular 6 of 1967==
'''Ampera Cabinet Presidium Circular 6 of 1967''' ({{lang-id|Surat Edaran Presidium Kabinet Ampera Nomor SE-06/Pres.Kab/6/1967}}) was released on 28 June 1967. One of the points of contention is the selection of a proper term to describe Indonesian residents of Chinese descent. Accompanying explanatory text to Article 26 of the [[Constitution of Indonesia|1945 Constitution]] used the term ''Tionghoa'' to describe this group.&lt;ref&gt;{{id icon}} [[s:id:Penjelasan Undang-Undang Dasar Republik Indonesia 1945|Penjelasan Undang-Undang Dasar Republik Indonesia 1945]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] began using ''Tionghoa'' in its terminology, prompting the beginning of an unofficial ban on its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Pramoedya Ananta | last = Toer | authorlink = Pramoedya Ananta Toer | title = Hoakiau di Indonesia | publisher = Bintang Press | year = 1960 | location = Djakarta|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1967, a cabinet circular enforced the use of the term ''Cina'' over ''Tionghoa'' and ''Tiongkok''.&lt;ref&gt;{{id icon}} [[s:id:Surat Edaran Presidium Kabinet Ampera Nomor 06 Tahun 1967|Surat Edaran Presidium Kabinet Ampera Nomor 06 Tahun 1967]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other examples==
* Cabinet Presidium Instruction No. 37/U/IN/6/1967, prohibiting further residency or work permits to new Chinese immigrants, their wives, or children; freezing any capital raised by "foreigners" in Indonesia; closure of "foreign" schools except for diplomatic corps and their families; requiaring the number of Indonesian students to be the majority and in proportion to "foreigners" in any state schools; and making implementation of the "Chinese issue" be the responsibility of the minister for political affairs.
* Resolution of the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly No. 32, 1966 (TAP MPRS No. 32/1966), effectively banning the use of Chinese characters in newspapers and magazines.
* Home Affairs Ministry No. 455.2-360/1988 on Regulation of Temples, effectively and severely restricting building or repairing Chinese temples.
* Circular of the Director General for Press and Graphics Guidance in the Ministry of Information No. 02/SE/Ditjen-PPGK/1988, further restricting the usage of Chinese language and/or characters.
* Instruction of the Ministry of Home Affairs No. X01/1977 on Implementing Instructions for Population Registration and the confidential instructions No.3.462/1.755.6 of the Jakarta government 28 January 1980, both authorising special codes in national identification cards to indicate ethnic Chinese origin, the code being A01
* Cabinet Presidium Circular SE-06/Pres-Kab/6/1967 on Changing the Term China and Chinese, requiring the usage of the term "Cina" (considered a derogatory term by many Chinese Indonesians) instead of "Tionghoa" or "[[Tiongkok]]" (used by ethnic Chinese themselves).
* the status of Confucianism as one of Indonesia's six official religions was revoked. In 1978, the Minister of Home Affairs issued a directive that there were only five religions, excluding Confucianism. On 27 January 1979, a presidential cabinet meeting took place and it firmly decided that Confucianism was not a religion. Another directive from Minister of Home Affairs was issued in 1990 re-iterating about there being only five official religions in Indonesia.

==Anomalies and exceptions==
There are exceptions to laws and regulations that ban the use of [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]. The use of Mandarin in traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions, for example, is not prohibited, since legal proceedings related to this case have been suspended after lobbying made to the Attorney General (Jaksa Agung) of Indonesia by INI ([[Ikatan Naturopatis Indonesia]]).

==Current practice==
During his tenure as President, [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] ended restrictions on Chinese culture and language, and made [[Chinese New Year]] as a national holiday. Today, Indonesian Chinese hold the same rights as other ethnic groups. They can practise their culture daily, with the use of the Chinese language being also now allowed. [[Metro TV]] became the first to air its news in Chinese.

Chinese schools are now able to be established as either International or "National- plus" schools. Mandarin Chinese is also taught as an optional extracurricular subject in many schools.

'''Maojia''' (猫家 ''{{IPA|mau˥ka˥}}''&lt;ref name="Chen2013"&gt;Chen, Qiguang [陈其光] (2013). ''Miao and Yao language'' [苗瑶语文]. Beijing: China Minzu University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[mixed language]] in Southern China. Some scholars think Maojiahua is a [[Hmongic]] dialect of [[Hmong-Mien languages]], although it absorbs a lot of Chinese words. Others treat Maojiahua as [[Chinese dialect]] which mixes with [[Hmong-Mien languages]].

Maojiahua is spoken by about 200,000 people of Au-Ka (Aoka 奥卡) [[Miao people|Miao]] [[ethnic group|ethnicity]] in [[Chengbu Miao Autonomous County|Chengbu]], [[Suining County, Hunan|Suining]], [[Wugang, Hunan|Wugang]] and [[Suining County, Hunan|Suining]] in southwest part of [[Hunan Province]], as well as in [[Ziyuan County|Ziyuan]] and [[Longsheng County|Longsheng]] in north part of Guangxi Province.&lt;ref&gt;http://asiaharvest.org/wp-content/themes/asia/docs/people-groups/China/chinaPeoples/A/Aoka.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Chen Qiguang (2013:32),&lt;ref name="Chen2013"/&gt; "Maojia" (''{{IPA|mau˥ka˥}}''), also known as "Qingyi Miao 青衣苗", is spoken mostly in [[Chengbu Miao Autonomous County|Chengbu County]], [[Hunan]], and also in Suining, Wugang, Longsheng, and Ziyuan counties. There is a total of about 120,000 speakers. The representative dialect given in Chen (2013) is that of Xintang Village 信塘村, Yangshi Township 羊石乡, [[Chengbu Miao Autonomous County]], Hunan Province. Li (2004) covers various dialects of Qingyi Miao in detail.

'''Medefaidrin''' (Medefidrin), or ''Obɛri Ɔkaimɛ'', is an artificial language and script created as a Christian [[sacred language]] by an [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]] congregation in 1930s Nigeria. It has its roots in [[glossolalia]] ('speaking in tongues').

Speakers consider Medefaidrin to be a 'spirit language'. It was created by two leaders of the church, Michael Ukpong and Akpan Akpan Udofia. They report that the [[Holy Spirit]] revealed the words of the language to Ukpong, while Udofia wrote them down. At the time Ibibio was not a written language, and Udofia created a script to write Medefaidrin.

After finalizing the language in 1936, members of the church started a school in which children were instructed in Medefaidrin. This was not tolerated by the British colonial government, who closed the school that same year. Nonetheless, the language continued to be used for church activities, including liturgy and hymns, and for letters and written contracts between members. The language faded from use, but in 1986 Udofia began teaching it again in the church's Sunday school in [[Ididep]]. Old manuscripts in the script are in poor condition, and in the 21st century there has been some effort to preserve them.

In structure, the language is largely a [[relexification]] of English, though the [[semantics]] are closer to the native language of its users, [[Ibibio language|Ibibio]]. Medefaidrin is a stress-accented rather than tonal language, though this may be changing under Ibibio influence. There are several [[consonant cluster]]s that do not exist in English. (Ibibio has no consonant clusters.) The definite article is ''dei'', and several prepositions alliterate or rhyme with their English equivalents: ''su'' "to", ''fra'' "from", ''nai'' "by", ''kin'' "in". Most words, however, resemble nothing in English or Ibibio, but appear to have been created without a specific underlying system. The [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] is not highly developed, but a few elements have been taken from English, such as the plural in -s (z?). The [[vigesimal]] numbering system, however, and the calendar, reflect Ibibio norms. The calendar year contains sixteen four-week months.&lt;ref&gt;The week is reported to consist of eight days, but it is not clear if it is 8 by Ibibio or English counting. What is 2 days from now in English is 3 days from now in Ibibio (with today counted as the first day), so starting a new week every 8 days when thinking in Ibibio means every 7 days when thinking in English.&lt;/ref&gt;

The script has upper- and lower-case letters like the English alphabet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2016/16101r-medefaidrin.pdf | title=L2/16-101R: Proposal for encoding the Medefaidrin (Oberi Okaime) script in the SMP of the UCS | first1=Andrij | last1=Rovenchak | first2=Dafydd | last2=Gibbon | first3=Moses | last3=Ekpenyong | first4=Eno-Abasi | last4=Urua | publisher=ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2 | date=2016-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the letters were invented and there is no systematic relationship between glyph and sound. There are a number of arbitrary digraphs, whose pronunciation cannot be determined from their component letters, again as in English.

{{refimprove|date=June 2011}}

A '''Nantucket sleighride''' was a term used by [[Nantucket, Massachusetts|Nantucket]] whalers to describe what occurs immediately following the [[harpooning]] of a [[whale]]. The whale, distressed by the harpoon, attempts to flee and thus drags the whalers' longboat along with it. The speed of the "sleigh ride" would vary depending on the species of the whale, with certain species (e.g. humpbacks) giving faster rides. The [[sperm whale]] was the whale that caused the longest drag events, reaching speeds of 23&amp;nbsp;mph (37&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name="Salariya" /&gt; The length of the drag for the sailors would last as long as the whale could swim before it became exhausted. [[Fin whale]]s and [[sei whale]]s were the most dangerous species, as they would dive scores of fathoms deep taking the longboat and its occupants beneath the surface if possible. Once the whale had exhausted its energy, the sailors (if still alive) would kill it and harvest its oil.

The discovery of [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] in [[Pennsylvania]] in the mid-1800s began a slow end to the whale hunting by American whalers. Other nations followed as either they discovered petroleum reserves of their own, or the increase in the trade of natural gas and oil rendered whale hunting less worthy of the dangers inherent in its pursuit. [[Japan]] still engages in the practice; [[Norway]] closed its last rendering station at [[Grytviken]] ([[South Georgia Island]]) about 1965.

'''Nayi''' (also known as "Nao") is an [[Omotic]] language of the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language family spoken in western [[Ethiopia]].  
Most of the speakers of the language live in two separated areas. The largest grouping live in [[Decha]] [[woreda]] of the [[Keffa Zone]]. The nearest city to their region is [[Bonga]]. A few in Dulkuma village of the Shoa Bench woreda, some in [[Sheko (woreda)|Sheko]] woreda having moved there in 1976-1977 as a result of conflicts between local feudal lords and the military government (Aklilu 2002:4). In Decha, young people no longer speak the language.

The language is notable for its [[retroflex consonant]]s (Aklilu Yilma 1988), a striking feature shared with closely related [[Dizi language|Dizi]], [[Sheko language|Sheko]] and nearby (but not closely related) [[Bench language|Bench]].  The language has 5 vowels that can be long or short.  The question of the status of a short mid central vowel is still unresolved. There are three phonemic tones and syllabic nasal consonants. There are [[ejective consonants|ejective]] stops and affricates, but no [[implosives]] (Aklilu 2002:6,7).

Nayi, together with the [[Dizi language|Dizi]] and [[Sheko language|Sheko]] languages, is part of a cluster of languages variously called "Maji" or "[[Dizoid languages|Dizoid]]".

'''Page 3''' was a feature in the British [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' for over 44 years, from November 1970 until January 2015. It consisted of a large photograph of a [[topless]] female [[glamour model]], often known as a "Page 3 girl," usually published on the third page of the print edition.

When ''The Sun'' became a tabloid on 17 November 1969, it began intermittently publishing images of clothed glamour models on its third page. The editors introduced nudity on 17 November 1970 when they printed an image of 20-year-old model [[Stephanie Marrian|Stephanie Khan]] in her "birthday suit" to celebrate the newspaper's first anniversary as a tabloid. Topless Page 3 girls soon became a regular feature in ''The Sun'' and are credited with helping to boost the newspaper's circulation significantly in the 1970s and 1980s. Some Page 3 girls became household names. [[Samantha Fox]], who appeared on Page 3 from 1983 to 1986, became one of the most photographed British women of the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/12/samantha-fox-glamour-model-fame-16-stalkers-david-cassidy | work=[[The Guardian]] | title=Samantha Fox on fame at 16, stalkers and David Cassidy | first=Amy | last=Fleming | date=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and famously earned more than then-prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] while still in her teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30899581 | work=[[BBC News]] | title=How Page Three fell out of step with the times | first=Justin | last=Parkinson | date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's other [[Tabloid (newspaper format)#Red top tabloids|"red top" tabloids]] introduced competing features under different names. ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|The Daily Star]]'' called its topless models "Starbirds." ''[[Daily Mirror|The Daily Mirror]]'' also experimented with topless models, although it scrapped the feature in the 1980s. 

Page 3 generated considerable controversy throughout its run. Critics often argued that Page 3 objectified and demeaned women. Others believed that images of topless glamour models were inappropriate for a generally circulated national newspaper. Campaigners regularly advocated for legislation to ban Page 3 or tried to convince newspaper owners and editors to voluntarily eliminate the feature or modify it so that models no longer appeared topless. Campaigns against Page 3 proved fruitless for many years, with ''The Sun'' often branding opponents of the feature, such as Labour MP [[Clare Short]], as killjoys. However, pressure increasingly mounted on the publication to end the feature after activists launched a [[No More Page 3]] campaign in 2012.

The Irish edition of ''The Sun'' ceased publishing topless Page 3 models in August 2013, citing cultural differences between Ireland and the UK. The decision was subsequently taken to drop Page 3 from the UK edition as well. On 19 January 2015, another [[News UK]] title, ''[[The Times]]'', reported that it "understands that Friday's edition of [''The Sun''] was the last that will carry an image of a glamour model with bare breasts on that page."&lt;ref name="O'Carroll"&gt;Lisa O'Carroll, Mark Sweney and Roy Greenslade [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jan/19/has-the-sun-axed-page-3-topless-pictures "The Sun calls time on topless Page 3 models after 44 years"], ''The Guardian'', 19 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;Lucy Hunter Johnston [https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/it-wasnt-the-nipples-that-made-page-three-so-utterly-offensive-9990244.html "Page 3 is still demeaning – even without the nipples"]. ''The Independent'', 20 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; However, after several days of publishing images of clothed glamour models, ''The Sun'' on 22 January 2015 stated on its front page that "We've had a mammary lapse" and featured a topless photograph of 22-year-old Nicole Neal on Page 3. This seeming intent to restore topless models caused a media and social media backlash, after which no further Page 3 images appeared in the print edition.&lt;ref name="Telegraph2015"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/11361739/The-Sun-brings-back-page-3.html "The Sun brings back Page 3"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 22 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenslade060315"&gt;Roy Greenslade (6 March 2015).

As of September 2018, the Page3.com website has been removed. ''The Daily Star'' has continued to print topless models on Page 3. 

==History==
===Beginnings and early years===
When [[Rupert Murdoch]] relaunched the flagging ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|Sun]]'' newspaper in [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] format on 17 November 1969, he began publishing photographs of clothed glamour models on its third page in a move intended to help the paper compete with its principal rival, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', which was printing photos of women in lingerie or bikinis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inside Rupert's Brain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yHOxG4rq72YC|first=Paul|last=La Monica|publisher=Penguin|year=2009|isbn=9781101016596}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition featured that month's [[Penthouse Pet]], Ulla Lindstrom, wearing a suggestively unbuttoned shirt. Page 3 photographs over the following year were often provocative, but did not feature nudity.

Whether it was editor [[Larry Lamb (newspaper editor)|Larry Lamb]] or Murdoch who decided to introduce the Page 3 feature is disputed, but on 17 November 1970, the tabloid celebrated its first anniversary by publishing a photograph of 20-year-old Singapore born model [[Stephanie Marrian|Stephanie Khan]] in her "birthday suit" (i.e., in the nude).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who was Stephanie?

Page 3 was not a strictly daily feature at the beginning of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Greenslade [https://books.google.com/books?id=KPR0pB9UCS4C&amp;pg=PA250 ''Press Gang: How Newspapers Majke Profits From Propaganda''], London and Basingstoke: Pan, 2003 [2004], p.250&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sun'' only gradually began to feature Page 3 models in more overtly topless poses, with their nipples clearly visible. The feature, and the paper's other sexual content, quickly led to ''The Sun'' being banned from some public libraries. The first such decision was taken by a Conservative council in Sowerby Bridge, Yorkshire, although it was reversed after a series of local stunts organised by the newspaper and a change in the council's political orientation in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Chippindaler and Chris Horrie ''Stick It Up Your Punter: The Uncut Story of the ''Sun'' newspaper'', London: Pocket Books, 1999 [2005], p.47-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HorrieBBC"&gt;Chris Horrie [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1026989.stm "Flirty not dirty at 30"], BBC News (London), 17 November 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The feature is partly credited with the increased circulation that established ''The Sun'' as one of the most popular newspapers in the United Kingdom by the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Ethics for journalists | series=Media skills | first=Richard | last=Keeble | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | year=2009 | isbn=0-415-43074-7 | page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to compete with ''The Sun'', the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' tabloids also began publishing images of topless women, although the ''Daily Mirror'' stopped featuring topless models in the 1980s, deeming the photographs demeaning to women.

===After the mid-1990s===
''The Sun'' made some stylistic changes to Page 3 in the mid-1990s. It became standard to print Page 3 photographs in colour rather than in black and white. Captions to Page 3 photographs, which previously contained sexually suggestive [[double entendre]], were replaced by a simple listing of models' first names, ages, and hometowns. After polling its readers, ''The Sun'' in 1997 instituted a policy of featuring only models with natural breasts.&lt;ref name="Addley"&gt;Esther Addley [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jan/23/page-3-sun-rupert-murdoch "The Sun’s Page 3 is surviving on nothing but a necklace and a wink"], ''The Guardian'', 23 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1999, ''The Sun'' launched its official Page 3 website, ''Page3.com'', which featured the tabloid's daily Page 3 girl in three different poses, including the photograph published in the printed edition. On 1 August 2013, coinciding with the launch of the subscription-based website ''Sun+'', the official Page 3 website became accessible only to ''Sun+'' subscribers.

Before 2003, British tabloids sometimes featured 16- and 17-year-old girls as topless models. [[Samantha Fox]], [[Maria Whittaker]], [[Debee Ashby]], and others began their topless modelling careers in ''The Sun'' when they were 16. The ''[[Daily Sport]]'' was even known to count down the days until it would feature a girl topless on her 16th birthday, as it did with [[Linsey Dawn McKenzie]] in 1994. After 2003, the legal age for topless modelling was raised to 18.

During her tenure as deputy editor of ''The Sun'', [[Rebekah Brooks]] argued that Page 3 lowered the newspaper's circulation because women readers found the feature offensive. When she became the tabloid's first female editor in January 2003, she was widely expected either to terminate the feature or to modify it so that models no longer exposed their breasts. However, Brooks changed her position and became a staunch advocate of the feature.&lt;ref name=obs030713/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1418828/Sun's-first-woman-editor-to-keep-Page-Three-Girls.html | location=London | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | title=Sun's first woman editor to keep Page Three Girls | first=Tom | last=Leonard | date=14 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later wrote an editorial defending Page 3 from its critics, calling its models "intelligent, vibrant young women who appear in ''The Sun'' out of choice and because they enjoy the job."&lt;ref name=Killjoy /&gt; ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' journalist [[Hadley Freeman]] in 2005 accused Brooks of having "played up" Page 3 by introducing the "News in Briefs" caption (a paragraph attributing the newspaper's editorial views to the Page 3 model).&lt;ref&gt;Hadley Freeman [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jun/16/sundaytelegraph.pressandpublishing "Ladies of the press"], ''The Guardian'', 16 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brooks&gt;{{cite news|last=Ditum|first=Sarah|title=Good riddance to News in Briefs, the nastiest part of Page 3|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/media/2013/06/good-riddance-news-briefs-nastiest-part-page-3|accessdate=1 September 2013|newspaper=[[New Statesman]]|date=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The caption was removed in June 2013 when [[David Dinsmore]] took over as editor.&lt;ref name=Waugh&gt;{{cite news|last=Waugh|first=Paul|title=Politics Home (The Waugh Room): Page 3 girls lose their voice|url=http://www.politicshome.com/uk/article/80774/end_of_an_era.html|accessdate=1 September 2013|newspaper=Politics Home|publisher=[[Dods (Group) PLC|Dods Monitoring]]|date=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies and campaigns==
Critics usually considered Page 3 to be demeaning and objectifying to women, a form of [[softcore pornography]]&lt;ref name="Braid"&gt;Mary Braid [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3651850.stm "Page Three girls – the naked truth"], BBC News, 14 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; that was inappropriate for publication in a national newspaper readily available to children. Some campaigners sought legislation to have Page 3 banned. Others, wary of calling for government censorship of the press, sought to convince newspaper editors and owners to voluntarily remove the feature or modify it so that it no longer featured a topless female model.

A [[YouGov]] survey carried out in October 2012 found marked differences in attitude toward Page 3 among readers of different newspapers. 61% of ''Sun'' readers wished to retain the feature, while 24% said that the newspaper should stop showing Page 3 women. However, only 4% of ''Guardian'' readers said ''The Sun'' should keep Page 3, while 86% said it should be abolished. The poll also found notable differences by gender, with 48% of men overall saying that Page 3 should be retained, but just 17% of women taking that position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survey Report |url= http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/6jyst3v95o/YG-Archive-Pol-Sun-results-021012-Page-3-girls.pdf |work=YouGov / The Sun Survey Results|publisher=YouGov|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political campaigners for legislative action against Page 3 included Labour Party MPs [[Clare Short]] and [[Harriet Harman]], Liberal Democrat MP [[Lynne Featherstone]], and Green Party MP [[Caroline Lucas]]. ''The Sun'' has responded to such campaigns with mockery. When Short tried in 1986 to introduce a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] bill banning topless models from British newspapers, ''The Sun'' branded her "killjoy Clare".&lt;ref&gt;Assinder, Nick (12 May 2003). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2835059.stm Profile of Clare Short], ''[[BBC News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; When Short renewed her campaign against Page 3 in 2004, ''The Sun'' superimposed her face on a Page 3 model's body and accused her of being "fat and jealous".&lt;ref name=Killjoy&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jan/14/pressandpublishing.politicsandthemedia | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]] | title=Sun turns on 'killjoy' Short in Page 3 row | first=Ciar | last=Byrne | date=14 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sun'' also branded Harman a "feminist fanatic" and Featherstone a "battleaxe" because of their stances against Page 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/election2010/2974248/Liberal-Democrats-to-ban-Page-3.html|title=Lib Dems 'to Ban Page 3' Beauties|last=Newton Dunn|first=Tom|date=15 May 2010|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, Lucy-Anne Holmes, a writer and actress from [[Brighton]], began a grassroots social media campaign called [[No More Page 3]] with the goal of convincing ''The Sun''{{'s}} editors to voluntarily remove Page 3 from the newspaper. Holmes stated that she began the campaign after noticing that despite the achievements of Britain's women athletes in the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], the largest photograph of a woman in the nation's biggest-selling newspaper was "a massive image of a beautiful young woman in her knickers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|title=No More Page 3 campaigner Lucy-Anne Holmes on her battle with the Sun|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/mar/10/anti-page-3-the-sun-campaigner|accessdate=23 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes further argued that Page 3 perpetuated the outdated sexist norms of the 1970s, portrayed women as sex objects, negatively affected girls' and women's body image, and contributed to a culture of sexual violence against women and girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/exclusive-weve-seen-enough-breasts--why-i-started-the-no-more-page-3-campaign-8159600.html | location=London | work=[[The Independent]] | title=Exclusive: We've seen enough breasts – why I started the No More Page 3 campaign | first=Lucy | last=Holmes | date= 20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators, such as [[Kira Cochrane]] in ''The Guardian'', were supportive of Holmes' goals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|title=Could this campaign to stop Page 3 succeed?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/shortcuts/2012/sep/11/campaign-stop-page-3-succeed|accessdate=23 August 2013|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although commentators in publications such as the ''Telegraph'' and ''New Statesman'' criticised the campaign, calling it "censorious" and "sinister".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/brendanoneill2/100181517/the-censorious-campaign-against-page-3-is-driven-by-the-oldest-and-most-foul-form-of-snobbery/ | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | title=The censorious campaign against Page 3 is driven by the oldest and most foul form of snobbery | first=Brendan | last=O'Neill | date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/media/2012/10/sinister-campaign-against-page-3 | work=[[New Statesman]] | title=The sinister campaign against Page 3 | first=Martin | last=Robbins | date=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] party conference in September 2012, former MP [[Evan Harris]] with the support of others, lent support to Holmes' campaign by proposing a party motion to "[tackle] the projection of women as sex objects to children and adolescents by restricting sexualised images in newspapers and general circulation magazines to the same rules that apply to pre-watershed broadcast media".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liberal Democrats Autumn Conference: Conference Extra 2011 | url = http://www.libdems.org.uk/siteFiles/resources/docs/conference/Conference%20Extra%20Autumn2011.pdf | publisher = Liberal Democrats | accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, party leader and deputy prime minister [[Nick Clegg]] distanced himself from the motion. In an October 2012 radio interview, Clegg said he did not support a legislative ban on Page 3, believing that government in a liberal society should not dictate the content of newspapers. "If you don't like it, don't buy it ... you don't want to have a moral policeman or woman in Whitehall telling people what they can and cannot see," Clegg stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/12/clegg-banning-sun-page-3-illiberal | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]] | title=Rupert Murdoch hints at Page 3 replacement in The Sun | first=Nicholas | last=Watt | date=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Leveson Inquiry]] heard arguments for and against Page 3. Representatives of women's groups (including Object and the End Violence Against Women Coalition) argued that Page 3 was part of an endemic culture of tabloid sexism that routinely objectified and sexualised women. The inquiry also heard testimony from ''Sun'' editor Dominic Mohan, who argued that Page 3 was an "innocuous British institution" that had become a "part of British society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/16927925 | location=London | publisher=BBC | title=Sun editor Dominic Mohan defends Page Three (video footage from The Leveson Inquiry) |accessdate=23 August 2013 | first=News: video | last=BBC | date=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Leveson report concluded that arguments over Page 3, and the representation of women in the tabloid press more generally, raised "important and sensitive issues which merit further consideration by any new regulator".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the press | url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/hc1213/hc07/0780/0780_ii.pdf | work = The Leveson Inquiry | publisher = HMSO | accessdate = 23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, [[Rupert Murdoch]], chairman and chief executive of News International, parent group of the ''Sun,'' stated on social networking site Twitter that he was considering replacing Page 3 with a "halfway house", whereby Page 3 would feature clothed glamour photographs, but not bare breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21408900 | location=London | publisher=BBC | title=Rupert Murdoch hints at Page 3 replacement in The Sun | date=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Green Party MP [[Caroline Lucas]] defied parliamentary dress code to wear a T-shirt bearing the slogan "No More Page Three" during a House of Commons debate on media sexism. Arguing that ''The Sun'' newspaper should be removed from sale in Parliament until it dropped the feature, she said that "if Page Three still hasn't been removed from ''The Sun'' by the end of this year, I think we should be asking the government to step in and legislate". Culture minister [[Ed Vaizey]] responded by stating that the government did not plan to regulate the content of the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22873790 | publisher=BBC News | title=Caroline Lucas in Page Three T-shirt protest during debate | date=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, newly appointed ''Sun'' editor [[David Dinsmore]] confirmed that he would continue printing photographs of topless women on Page 3, calling it "a good way of selling newspapers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/26/sun-page-3-topless-women-david-dinsmore | first=Josh | last=Halliday | accessdate=19 July 2013 | work=[[The Guardian]] | title=Sun's Page 3 photos of topless women will stay, says new editor | date=26 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, citing "cultural differences" between the UK and Ireland, Paul Clarkson, editor of ''The Sun''{{'}}s Irish Republic edition, announced that he would no longer print images of topless models on Page 3. The Irish ''Sun'' now features images of glamour models with their breasts covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenslade|first=Roy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/aug/08/sun-page-3|title=The Sun's Irish edition drops topless Page 3 pictures|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= 8 August 2013| accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Slattery|first=Laura|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/media-and-marketing/irish-sun-ditches-bare-breasts-on-page-3-1.1487381|title='Irish Sun' ditches bare breasts on Page 3|work=The Irish Times |location=Ireland |date= 8 August 2013| accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The No More Page 3 campaign called the decision "a huge step in the right direction", and thanked Clarkson "for taking the lead in the dismantling of a sexist institution", and called on Dinsmore to follow suit with the newspaper's UK edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reynolds|first=John|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/aug/08/sun-page-3-pressure-irish|title=The Sun's Page 3 under renewed pressure after Irish cover up|work=[[The Guardian]] |location=UK |date= 8 August 2013| accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hopes of campaigners were further raised when Rupert Murdoch, in his Twitter feed in September 2014 suggested the Page 3 feature was "old fashioned". Eighteen months earlier on Twitter Murdoch had suggested that it might be better to show "glamorous fashionistas" (i.e., clothed models).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|first=Jane|last=Martinson|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/sep/10/rupert-murdoch-sun-page-3-old-fashioned|title=Rupert Murdoch says the Sun's page 3 is old fashioned|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murdoch affirmed that the feature would eventually end in an interview for ''[[India Today]]'' magazine in 1994. While defending it from criticism, he said: "But show it to me in any other newspaper I own. Never in America, never in Australia. Never. Never. Never. It just would not be accepted."&lt;ref name="Addley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Braid"/&gt;

==End of the feature==
The feature in the British newspaper was reported as having been scrapped in 2015 with the edition of 16 January supposedly the last to carry the feature, after a 20 January article in ''[[The Times]]'', another Murdoch paper, said that a decision had been made to end Page 3 in the present incarnation.&lt;ref name="Addley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bill Gardner [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/11356186/Has-The-Sun-quietly-dropped-Page-3.html "The Sun drops Page 3"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 19 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2015, after an absence of six days, ''The Sun'' returned to publishing shots of topless female models. A notice appeared in the issue: "Further to recent reports in all other media outlets, we would like to clarify that this is Page 3 and this is a picture of Nicole, 22, from Bournemouth. We would like to apologise on behalf of the print and broadcast journalists who have spent the last two days talking and writing about us."&lt;ref name="Telegraph2015"/&gt; In the evening of 21 January, Dylan Sharpe, the head of public relations at ''The Sun'' wrote on social media: "I said that it was speculation and not to trust reports by people unconnected to the Sun. A lot of people are about to look very silly".&lt;ref name="Quinn"&gt;Ben Quinn and Lisa O'Carroll [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jan/22/the-sun-topless-women-page-3 "The Sun brings back topless women days after apparent end of Page 3"], ''The Guardian'', 22 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparent ending of the feature gained much attention in the British press. Clare Short thought that the dropping of topless photographs on Page 3 of  ''The Sun'' "is an important public victory for dignity."&lt;ref&gt;Clare Short, et al [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/20/sun-scrapping-page-3-topless-victory-women "The panel: Is the Sun's scrapping of Page 3 topless models a victory for women?"], ''The Guardian'', 20 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; As Caroline Lucas explained in an article for ''[[The Independent]]'': "So long as ''The Sun'' reserves its right to print the odd topless shot, and reserve its infamous page for girls clad in bikinis, the conversation isn't over."&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Lucas [https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/page-3s-demise-should-be-celebrated-but-it-doesnt-mean-that-were-not-still-stuck-in-the-past-9990748.html "Page 3's demise should be celebrated, but it doesn't mean that we're not still stuck in the past"], ''The Independent'', 20 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The business minister [[Jo Swinson]] criticised the newspaper, saying that the decision to replace topless models with women in bikinis did not go far enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Page 3 Replacing Topless Models With Bikinis Not Far Enough, Says Equalities Minister|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/01/20/the-sun-page-3-jo-swinson-_n_6506362.html|date=20 January 2015|work=The Huffington Post UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the re-appearance of a topless Page 3 model after nearly a week's absence, Lucy-Anne Holmes wrote on social media: "So it seems the fight might be back on."&lt;ref name="Quinn"/&gt;

The edition of 22 January saw the return of a topless Page 3 model, but this revival has turned out to be a one-off.&lt;ref name="Greenslade060315"/&gt; ''The Sun'' continued to run the Page 3 website, featuring multiple topless shots of a different model on a daily basis until 29 March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.page3.com/ |title=Page3 Website July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724140008/https://www.page3.com/|archive-date=2018-07-24|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circa September 2018, the Page 3 website was taken down and the website's [[URL]] made to redirect to ''The Sun'' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.page3.com/|title=Page3 Website September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925164216//www.page3.com/|archive-date=2018-09-25|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1655">'''Pukka sahib''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ʌ|k|ə|_|ˈ|s|ɑː|(|ɪ|)|b}} {{respell|PUK|ə|_|SAH(-i)b}})&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]].&lt;/ref&gt; is a slang term taken from [[punjabi language|Punjabi]] words for "Absolute" ("first class", "absolutely genuine" for [[English language|English]] users) and "master", but meaning "true gentleman" or "excellent fellow". The expression was used in the [[British Empire]] to describe [[Europe]]ans or to describe an attitude which British administrators were said to affect, that of an "aloof, impartial, incorruptible
arbiter of the political fate of a large part of the earth's surface".&lt;ref&gt;"Race against Time"
M. Freedman, ''Phylon'', 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "pukka" is still used formally in 21st-century English to describe something as "first class" or "absolutely genuine". As a slang term, it is often used by British service-people.

==Trivia==
The term is frequently referenced in [[E. M. Forster]]'s ''[[A Passage to India]]'', and in [[Agatha Christie]]'s [[Hercule Poirot]] series. In his anti-Empire novel ''[[Burmese Days]]'', [[George Orwell]] refers to it as a "pose", and one of his characters talks of the difficulty that goes into maintaining it.  Alexandra Fuller also uses the term in her book ''Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness.'' In the 1938 film, [[The Young in Heart]], [[Roland Young]]'s character Col. Anthony Carleton, assumes the title to enable his career as a card sharp and con man.

In May 1920, Haq became an editor of ''Shiksak'', an educational monthly magazine and remained with this magazine for three years. He was also a writer and earned considerable fame for his poems, novels, essays, and children's literature.&lt;ref name=bpedia/&gt;

==Life and works==

Rangarajan was born in [[Kumbakonam]] to [[Sanskrit]] scholar R.V. Krishnamacharya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiaeveryday.in/fullnews-ra-ki-rangarajan-passes-away-1005-4290958.htm Ra.Ki.

He was one of the greatest kings with many dimensions." The novel involved extensive research, including visits to libraries, as well as discussions with historians and artists.  Rangarajan stated that he was "an admirer of [[Kalki Krishnamurthy]]" and that he "tried to emulate his style."&lt;ref name=peppy&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/arts/books/article1525619.ece?homepage=true Peppy and prolific], ''The Hindu'', March 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Rangarajan said his inspirations were [[Charles Dickens]], [[Alexander Dumas]] and [[Jeffrey Archer]] in English; [[Kalki Krishnamurthy]] in Tamil.&lt;ref name=peppy/&gt;

[[Image:Colourful shopping carts.jpg|thumb|300px|A row of parked shopping carts equipped with coin-operated locking mechanisms]]
[[File:Plus Market shopping cart.jpg|thumb|200px|Shopping cart]]

A '''shopping cart''' ([[American English]]) or '''trolley''' ([[British English]]), also known by a variety of [[shopping cart#Name|other names]], is a [[cart]] supplied by a [[Retail#Types of retail outlets|shop]], especially [[supermarket]]s, for use by [[customer]]s inside the shop for transport of [[merchandise]] to the [[checkout counter]] during [[shopping]]. In many cases customers can then also use the cart to transport their purchased goods to their vehicles, but some carts are designed to prevent them from leaving the shop.

In many places in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], customers are allowed to leave the carts in designated areas within the [[parking lot]], and store personnel will return the carts to the storage area. In many continental European premises, however, coin- (or token-) operated locking mechanisms are provided to encourage shoppers to return the carts to the correct location after use.

Studies have shown that it is advisable for shoppers to sanitize the handles and basket areas prior to handling them or filling them with groceries due to high levels of [[bacteria]] that typically live on shopping carts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/yourlife/health/2011-03-02-grocerycarts_N.htm|title=Carts one of dirtiest places in grocery store, study says | first = Heather | last = VanNest | publisher = USATODAY.com | date = March 2, 2011 | accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the carts having a high level of exposure to the [[skin flora]] of previous users.

==Design==

[[Image:Carrinho.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A child-friendly shopping cart design]]
Most modern shopping carts are made of metal or a combination of metal and plastic and have been designed to nest within each other in a line to facilitate collecting and moving many at one time and also to save on storage space. The carts can come in many sizes, with larger ones able to carry a child. There are also specialized carts designed for two children, and electric [[mobility scooter]]s with baskets designed for disabled customers.

In the United States, 24,000 children are injured each year in shopping carts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shopping Cart–Related Injuries to Children|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/118/2/e540.abstract|work=Pediatrics|publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics|accessdate=June 20, 2012|author=Gary A. Smith, MD, DrPH|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some stores both in the USA and internationally have child carrying carts that look like a car or van with a seat where a child can sit equipped with a steering wheel and sometimes a horn.  Such "Car-Carts" may offer protection and convenience by keeping the child restrained, lower to the ground, protected from falling items, and amused.

Shopping carts are usually fitted with four wheels, however if any one wheel jams the cart can become difficult to handle. Most carts in the United States have [[Caster|swivel wheels]] at the front, while the rear wheels are fixed in orientation, while in Europe it is more common to have four swivel wheels. This difference in design correlates with smaller retail premises in Europe.

An alternative to the shopping cart is a small hand-held '''shopping basket'''. A customer may prefer a basket for a small amount of merchandise. Small shops, where carts would be impractical, often supply only baskets, or may offer a small cart which uses an inserted shopping basket within the frame of the cart to provide either choice to a customer.

==History==

=== Development of first shopping cart by Sylvan Goldman ===
One of the first shopping carts was introduced on June 4, 1937, the invention of [[Sylvan Goldman]], owner of the Humpty Dumpty supermarket chain in [[Oklahoma]]. One night, in 1936, Goldman sat in his office wondering how customers might move more groceries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sylvan Goldman: Fascinating facts about Sylvan Goldman inventor of the shopping cart in 1937 |url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventors/goldman.htm|work=The Great Idea Finder|publisher=The Great Idea Finder|accessdate=June 20, 2012|date=April 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found a wooden folding chair and put a basket on the seat and wheels on the legs. Goldman and one of his employees, a mechanic named Fred Young, began tinkering. Their first shopping cart was a metal frame that held two wire baskets. Since they were inspired by the folding chair, Goldman called his carts "folding basket carriers". Another mechanic, Arthur Kosted, developed a method to mass-produce the carts by inventing an assembly line capable of forming and welding the wire. The cart was awarded patent number 2,196,914 on April 9, 1940 (Filing date: March 14, 1938), titled, "Folding Basket Carriage for Self-Service Stores". They advertised the invention as part of a new “No Basket Carrying Plan."  Goldman had already pioneered self-serve stores and carts were part of the self-serve retail concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crockett|first1=Zachary|title=How a Basket on Wheels Revolutionized Grocery Shopping|url=http://priceonomics.com/how-a-basket-on-wheels-revolutionized-grocery/|website=Priceconomics|accessdate=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention did not catch on immediately.  Men found them effeminate; women found them suggestive of a baby carriage. "I've pushed my last baby," an offended woman informed Goldman.  After hiring several male and female models to push his new invention around his store and demonstrate their utility, as well as greeters to explain their use, shopping carts became extremely popular and Goldman became a multimillionaire. In urban areas like [[New York City]], where transporting groceries home from the store's parking lot is more likely to involve walking and/or a trip by [[public transportation]] than a car ride, privately owned carts resembling Goldman's design are still popular. Instead of baskets, these carts are built to hold the [[paper bag]]s dispensed by the grocery store.

Another shopping cart innovator was [[Orla watson|Orla Watson]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanprofile.com/articles/orla-watson-invented-the-grocery-cart-with-a-basket/ Orla Watson Invented the Grocery Cart with a Basket]. November 16, 2003. ''American Profile''.&lt;/ref&gt; who invented the swinging rear door to allow for "nesting" in 1946.&lt;ref name="WilsonGoldman"&gt;Terry P. Wilson, ''The Cart that Changed the World: The Career of Sylvan N. Goldman'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1978). {{ISBN|978-0-8061-1496-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InventionCart"&gt;Catherine Grandclément, "Wheeling One's Groceries Around the Store: The Invention of the Shopping Cart, 1936-1953", in Warren Belasco and Roger Horowitz (eds.), ''Food Chains: From Farmyard to Shopping Cart'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008), pp. 233-251. {{ISBN|978-0-8122-4128-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MorganOnGoldman"&gt;[[Ted Morgan (writer)|Ted Morgan]], ''On Becoming American: A Celebration of What it Means and How it Feels'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1978, pp. 45-6). {{ISBN|978-0-395-26283-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldman continued to make modifications to his original design, but advice from his trusted business partners Fred Taylor, a [[grocery store]] owner,&lt;ref name="ensmp1"/&gt; and George O'Donnell, a grocery store refrigeration salesman, and the incorporation of Watson's swinging door yielded the familiar nesting cart that we see today (albeit the original telescope cart had two baskets rather than one).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswise.com/articles/smithsonian-snapshot-telescoping-shopping-cart-c-1949 Smithsonian Snapshot: Telescoping Shopping Cart, c. 1949]. Newswise.com.&lt;/ref&gt;  Goldman patented a similar version of the cart which he called the "Nest-Kart" in 1948, over one year after Watson filed for his patent.&lt;ref name="ensmp1"&gt;Catherine Grandclément (2006). [http://www.csi.ensmp.fr/working-papers/WP/WP_CSI_006.pdf Wheeling food products around the store… and away:  the invention of the shopping cart, 1936-1953 ]. CSI Working Papers Series.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Nest-Kart incorporated the same nesting mechanism present on the shopping carts designed by Watson, and an interference investigation was ordered by Telescope Carts, Inc. alleging infringement of the patent in 1948.&lt;ref name="ensmp1"/&gt;  After a protracted legal battle, Goldman ultimately recognized Watson’s invention and paid one dollar in damages for counterfeit, in exchange for which Watson granted Goldman an exclusive operating license (apart from the three licenses that had already been granted).&lt;ref name="ensmp1"/&gt;

In 1909, Bessie DeCamp invented a seat belt for chairs, go-carts or carriages.&lt;ref&gt;Child's-chair safety device - Bessie DeCamp - patent #944,020&lt;/ref&gt; This was well before shopping carts with child seating areas were invented. Goldman introduced a child seating area on shopping carts in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unarco.com/carthistory.html|title=Unarco--Cart History|publisher=|accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Phil Ament |url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventors/goldman.htm |title=Inventor Sylvan Goldman Biography |publisher=Ideafinder.com |date= |accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For whatever reason, it wasn't until 1967 that seat belts for shopping carts were introduced by David Allen. It was high tech for the time, because it was a retractable seat belt.&lt;ref&gt;Safety retaining belt for shopping carts – David L. Allen – patent #3,550,136&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development of nesting carts by Orla Watson ===

[[File:The original two-basket Telescope Cart designed by Orla Watson.jpg|thumb|Original patent documents showing design of the nesting feature of the Telescope Cart.  The rear of the cart swings forward when a cart is shoved into it, hence the nesting feature.]]
[[Image:Shopping cart shepherd for Target jeh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Nested carts being returned from a [[parking lot]] to a [[Target Corporation#Target Stores|Target store]] by a [[cart pushing assist device]]]]
In 1946, [[Orla watson|Orla Watson]] devised a system for a telescoping (i.e., "nesting") shopping cart which did not require assembly or disassembly of its parts before and after use like Goldman's cart; Goldman's design up until this point required that the cart be unfolded much like a folding chair.&lt;ref name="ensmp1"/&gt;  This cart could be fitted into another cart for compact storage via a swinging one-way rear door.  The swinging rear door formed the basis of the patent claim, and was a major innovation in the evolution of the modern shopping cart.  Watson applied for a patent on his shopping cart invention in 1946, but Goldman contested it and filed an application for a similar patent with the swinging door feature on a shopping cart with only one basket in 1948 which Goldman named the "Nest-Kart". After considerable litigation and allegations of patent infringement, Goldman relinquished his rights to the patent in 1949 to Watson and his company, Telescope Carts, Inc. realizing that the swinging rear door feature was the key to Watson's patent.  Watson was awarded patent #2,479,530 on August 16, 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archpatent.com/applicants/%220%20E.%20WATSON%202%204%207%209%205%203%200%20STORE%20BASKET%20AND%20CARRIAGE%20Filed%20September%201946%201%22 |title=ArchPatent |publisher=ArchPatent |date= |accessdate=April 7, 2013 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In exchange, Goldman was granted an exclusive licensing right in addition to the three other licenses previously granted; Telescope Carts, Inc. continued to receive [[royalties]] for each cart produced by Goldman's company that incorporated the "nesting" design.  This included any shopping cart utilizing his hinged rear door, including the familiar single basket "nesting" designs similar to those used in the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeanne Sklar |url=http://amhistory.si.edu/archives/d8739.htm |title=Technology, Invention, and Innovation collections |publisher=Amhistory.si.edu |date= |accessdate=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to its overwhelming success, many different manufacturers desired to produce shopping carts with the rear swinging door feature but were denied due to the exclusive license issued to Goldman.  The federal government filed a lawsuit against Telescope Carts, Inc. in 1950 alleging the exclusive license granted to Goldman was invalid, and a [[Consent Decree]] was entered into where Telescope Carts, Inc. agreed to offer the same license to any manufacturer.  [[Orla Watson]] and Telescope Carts, Inc. licensed their telescoping shopping cart design to several manufacturers throughout the 1950s and 1960s until the [[patent]] expired.

=== New developments ===
In 2012, a driverless shopping cart was made by Chaotic Moon Labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/02/shoppingcart/|title=Microsoft Kinect Games Grocery Shopping at Texas Whole Foods|date=February 27, 2012|work=WIRED|accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device, called "Project Sk8" or "Smarter Cart" was basically a cart fitted with Windows Kinect (to detect obstacles), and an electric drivetrain, and used in conjunction with a Windows 8 tablet.  For smaller stores, shopping baskets with wheels can be used either as a large basket or a small cart.   These carts are designed for indoor use only

== Retail store acceptance ==

Past studies determined that retailers who did not offer shopping carts such as [[Sears]] suffered lower sales in comparison{{Vague|date=September 2016}} with retailers who did use shopping carts.&lt;ref&gt;Assortment (referencing a study by [https://web.archive.org/web/20011031161554/http://www.americasresearchgroup.com/britt.html Britt Beamer of America's Research Group]) [http://www.essortment.com/influence-shopping-cart-45466.html Influence Of The Shopping Cart], Retrieved on May 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
Subsequent to the introduction of shopping carts and centralized checkout lines at Sears stores, the company noticed a correlating increase in sales.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Steve Vitucci, Texas A&amp;M University&amp;nbsp;– Central Texas [http://www.tarleton.edu/~svitucci/Cases/Sears/SEARS%20UPDATE%20case%20notes.doc Sears update case notes], Retrieved on May 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 British supermarket chain [[Tesco]], trialed shopping carts with user-adjustable wheel resistance, heart rate monitoring and calorie counting hardware in an effort to raise awareness of health issues. The cart's introduction coincided with Tesco's sponsorship of the cancer awareness [[Race for Life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trolley offers supermarket workout|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3665777.stm|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=June 20, 2012|date=April 28, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trim Trolley Takes Off The Weight While You Grocery Shop|url=http://inventorspot.com/articles/trim_trolley_takes_weight_while__7543|work=Inventor Spot|publisher=Aha Cafe LLC.|accessdate=June 20, 2012|author=Elana Bowman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2004, shopping carts were identified as a source of [[pathogens]] and became a major public health concern.{{To whom?|date=September 2016}} This was primarily due to the media spotlight on a Japanese research study revealing large amounts of bacteria on shopping carts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.menshealth.com/health/eliminate-germs-your-life |title=Eliminate Germs from Your Life | first = Heather | last = Loeb | publisher=Menshealth.com | date = April 21, 2015 | accessdate = April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;African Journal of Microbiology Research Vol. 5(23), pp. 3998-4003, October 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Those findings were later backed by a [[University of Arizona]] study in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Sobotka (March 14, 2011.) [http://digitaljournal.com/article/304424 Study: E.coli contamination found on half of shopping carts]. ''Digital Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 researchers developed prototypes of computerized [[Context awareness|context aware]] shopping carts by attaching [[tablet computers]] to ordinary carts. Initial [[Field experiment|field trials]] showed that the prototype's context awareness provided an opportunity for enhancing and altering the shopping experience.&lt;ref&gt;Black, D., Clemmensen, N. J., and Skov, M. B. (2009) [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.149.7239&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Shopping in the Real World: Interacting with a Context-Aware Shopping Trolley], Proc. of Mobile Interaction with the Real World. Shopping in the Real World: Interacting with a Context-Aware Shopping Trolley &lt;/ref&gt;

Some retailers, such as [[Target Corporation|Target]], have begun using carts fully made of [[Plastic recycling|recycled plastic]] with the only metal part being the wheel axles, drawing away from the established metal cart design. Target's cart has won design awards for its improved casters, interchangeable plastic parts to simplify repairs, and handles that improve maneuverability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cook|first=Kim|title=Shopping cart advances just keep rolling along|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44431406/ns/business-retail/|accessdate=September 8, 2011|newspaper=MSNBC|date=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cart designs also incorporate additional features such as a [[cupholder]] for cold or hot drinks or a bouquet of flowers, along with other features such as a secure shelf for a [[tablet computer]] or [[mobile phone]] to allow the use of mobile coupons and circulars, or as seen in an all-plastic design created for the [[Wisconsin]]-based [[Festival Foods]] and also used by [[Whole Foods Market]] by [[Bemis Manufacturing Company]], all of these features, along with extra rungs on the side rail designed to attach plastic bags or carry handles for beverages. Smaller half-sized carts for smaller shopping trips have also become common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.plasticsnews.com/article/20160614/NEWS/160619934/bemis-develops-line-of-all-plastic-sh_2|title=Bemis develops line of all-plastic shopping carts|last=Jansen|first=Kerri|date=June 14, 2016|publisher=[[Plastics News]]|accessdate=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deposits==
[[File:Einkaufswagen-2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Shopping carts locked with a chain]]
[[File:Systec duraloc mechanism locked chain coin-1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Mechanism of a typical shopping cart lock]]

In many countries, the customer has to pay a small [[deposit account|deposit]] by inserting a [[coin]], token or card, which is returned if and when the customer returns the cart to a designated cart parking point. One motivation behind the deposit system is to reduce the expense of employees having to gather carts that are not returned, and to avoid damage done by runaway carts. Trolleys that are not returned may be returned voluntarily by a pedestrian, with the deposit coin acting as a reward.

Although almost ubiquitous in continental Europe and the UK, the deposit system is less common in Canada and has not been widely adopted in the United States, with the exception of some chains like [[Aldi]], which require a $0.25 deposit. Other stores such as [[Costco]] and [[ShopRite (United States)|ShopRite]] also use the coin deposit system, but it is not used at all of their locations.

In Australia, deposit systems are common in some local government areas as they have been made compulsory by local law.{{Citation needed|reason=Jan 2010|date=January 2010}} Usually, all [[ALDI]] stores, and most Coles{{Citation needed|reason=Jan 2010|date=January 2010}} and Woolworths{{Citation needed|reason=Jan 2010|date=January 2010}} stores will have a lock mechanism on their carts which requires a $1 or $2 coin to unlock.

The deposit varies, but usually coins of higher value, such as [[Euro|€]]1,  [[Pound Sterling|£]]1, or [[Canadian dollar|$]]1 are used. While the deposit systems usually are designed to accommodate a certain size of domestic coin, foreign coins, former currencies (like German [[Deutsche Mark|D-Marks]]), or even appropriately folded pieces of cardboard can be used to unlock the carts as well. Cart collectors are also usually provided with a special key which they can use to unlock the carts from the cart bay and get the key back.

Some retailers sell "tokens" as an alternative to coins, often for charity. Merchandising companies also offer branded shopping tokens as a product.

==Theft prevention==

Shopping cart theft can be a costly problem with stores that use them. The carts, which typically cost between $75 and $150 each with some models being $300–400, are removed by people for various purposes. To prevent costly theft, estimated at $800 million worldwide per annum, stores use various security systems as discussed below.&lt;ref name="wheels"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/06.03.99/shoppingcarts-9922.html | title = Wheels of Fortune | first = Kelly | last = Wilkinson | first2 = Michael | last2 = Learmonth | work = Metroactive | date = June 3, 1999 | accessdate = May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cart retrieval service===

Most retailers in North America {{citation needed|date=December 2015}} utilize a cart retrieval service, which collects carts found off the store's premises and returns them to the store for a fee. The primary strength of this system is the ability of pedestrian customers to take purchases home and allow retailers to recapture abandoned carts in a timely manner at a fraction of the cost of a replacement cart. It also allows retailers to maintain their cart inventories without an expensive capital outlay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Montague|first=Julian|title=The Stray Shopping Cart Project|url=http://www.strayshoppingcart.com/shopping_cart/1_introduction.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424180727/http://www.strayshoppingcart.com/shopping_cart/1_introduction.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 24, 2006|work=Web Site|publisher=The Stray Shopping Cart Project|accessdate=September 8, 2011|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt; A drawback of this method is that it is reactive instead of proactively preventing the carts from leaving a parking lot.&lt;ref name="wheels"/&gt;

===Electronic and magnetic===

Electronic systems are sometimes used by retailers. Each shopping cart is fitted with an electronic locking [[wheel clamp]], or 'boot'. US Patent No. 5598144A.  A transmitter with a thin wire is placed around the perimeter of the parking lot, and the boot locks when the cart leaves the designated area. Store personnel must then deactivate the lock with a handheld remote to return the cart to stock. Often a line is painted in front of the broadcast range to warn customers that their cart will stop when rolled past the line. However, these systems are very expensive to install and although helpful are not foolproof. The wheels can be lifted over the electronic barrier and/or pushed hard enough that the locks break.&lt;ref name="wheels"/&gt;&lt;ref name="corraling"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/CORRALING+CARTS%3B+ANTI-THEFT+DEVICE+KEEPS+SHOPPING+BASKETS+IN+THEIR...-a083608953 | title = Corralling Carts: Anti-Theft Device Keeps Shopping Baskets In Their Place | first = Dara Akiko | last = William | date = April 20, 1999 | work = [[Los Angeles Daily News]] | publisher = Gale Group | accessdate = May 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also safety concerns if the person pushing the trolley is running, and also if the trolley doesn't lock and is taken onto a road, locking due to magnetic materials under the road. Some cities have required retailers to install locking wheel systems on their shopping carts. In some cases, electronic systems companies have encouraged passage of such laws to create a captive audience of potential customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Elmahrek|first=Adam|title=Santa Ana Shopping Cart Law Shows Extent of Mayor's Business Dealings|url=http://www.voiceofoc.org/oc_central/article_cbb69e46-3fef-11e0-89d8-001cc4c002e0.html|accessdate=September 8, 2011|newspaper=Voice of OC|date=February 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical===
A low-tech form of theft prevention utilizes a physical impediment, such as vertical posts at the store entrance to keep carts from being taken into the parking lot. This method also impedes physically disabled customers, which may be illegal in many jurisdictions. For example, in the [[United States of America|United States,]] it is a violation of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]].&lt;ref name="corraling"/&gt;

Another method is to mount a pole taller than the entrance, onto the shopping cart, so that the pole will block exit of the cart. However, this method requires that the store aisles be higher than the pole, including lights, piping, any overhead signage and fixtures. It also prevents customers from carting their purchases to their cars in the store's carts.  Many customers learn to bring their own folding or otherwise collapsible cart with them, which they can usually hang on the store's cart while shopping.

A further system is to use a [[cattle grid]] style system. All pedestrian exits have specially designed flooring tiles which, along with specially designed wheels on the cart, will immobilize the cart as they roll onto them. Like the magnetic systems, this can easily be overcome by lifting the cart over the tiles.

Some retailers, including the [[Aldi]] chain of supermarkets, use a system where each cart has a lock mounted on the handle, connecting it to the cart in front of it when nested together, or to a chain mounted on a cart collection corral. The lock releases when a suitable coin or token is inserted, and the user gets their coin or token ejected back out of the lock when the cart is reattached to another trolley. This encourages shoppers to bring their carts back, solving both theft and the issue of carts being left around parking lots. The system is slightly flawed, however, in that carts can be attached to each other away from the corral and retrieve your tokens from all but the front-most cart.

==For people with a disability==
{{Main|Motorized shopping cart}}

Special electronic shopping carts are provided by many retailers for the elderly or people with a disability. These are essentially [[electric wheelchair]]s with an attached basket. They allow customers to navigate around the store and collect items.

Manually powered carts are also available specifically designed for use by wheelchair users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trolley for use with a wheelchair, United States Patent 4555124|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4555124.html|work=FPO|publisher=FreePatentsOnline.com|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zinc Plated Clear Coated Wire Basket Shopping Cart/Trolleys with multiple capacities|url=http://www.qhdc.com.au/category/2-shopping-trolleys-accessories|work=QHDC Australia|publisher=QHDC Australia PTY LTD|accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A still to be implemented aid for people with disabilities is the addition of a guide wheel at the center of rotation of a cart with four caster wheels.

The '''Sotho–Tswana languages''' are a group of closely related [[Southern Bantu languages]] spoken in Southern Africa. 
The Sotho–Tswana group corresponds to the S.30 label in [[Malcolm Guthrie|Guthrie's]] (1967–1971) [[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages|classification]]&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, Malcolm (1967-1971). ''Comparative Bantu: An Introduction to the Comparative Linguistics and Prehistory of the Bantu Languages''. (Volumes 1-4). Farnborough: Gregg International, cf. [http://www.cbold.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/Lgs/LgsbyGN.html the CBOLD Guthrie name list] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130051056/http://www.cbold.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/Lgs/LgsbyGN.html |date=2006-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of languages in the Bantu family.

The group is divided into three branches, Tswana (or ''Tswanaic'') and Sotho, as follows:
*Tswanaic (also wrongly referred to as Western Sotho)
**[[Tswana language|Tswana]] (''Setswana''), with dialects:     Hurutshe,     Kgatla,    Kwena,    Lete,    Ngwaketse,    Ngwato,    Rolong,    Tawana,    Tlharo,    Tlhaping,    Tlharo,  Fokeng,   [[Tlokwa]]
**[[Kgalagadi language|Kgalagadi]], with dialects:   Nuclear Kgalagadi (Kgalagadi proper),  Balaongwe,     Kenyi,     Khakhae, Koma,    Ngologa,    Pedi,   Phaleng,   Rhiti,   Shaga,    Siwane
*Sotho
**Sesotho-Lozi
***Southern Sotho or [[Sotho language|Sotho]] proper (''Sesotho'') :   Phuthi, Taung
***[[Lozi language|Lozi]] (''Silozi'' or Rozi)
** [[Northern Sotho language|Northern Sotho]] (''Sesotho sa Leboa'')
***Birwa
***Lovedu
*** Sepedic: includes Pedi and  Tswapong:
****Pedi:     Sehananwa (GaMmalebogo-Makgababeng), Sekgaga (Greater [[Lebowakgomo]]), Sekhutswe, Sekopa, Masemola (GaMasemola), Sekone (GaMatlala-Moletši), Sepai, Phalaborwa, Sepulana/Sepulane ([[Mashishing]]-[[Bushbuckridge]]), Setlokwa (Botlokwa and GaManthata), Tšhwene (GaTšhwene)
****Tswapong
*[[Pretoria Sotho|Sepitori]]

The various dialects of Tswana, Southern Sotho and Northern Sotho are highly mutually intelligible.&lt;ref name=Makalela&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/figure/10.1080/19313150903073489 |title=Harmonizing South African Sotho Language Varieties: Lessons From Reading Proficiency Assessment |author=Leketi Makalela |year=2009|journal= International Multilingual Research Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On more than one occasion, proposals have been put forward to create a unified Sotho–Tswana language.&lt;ref name=Makalela&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EPLouw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/African%20Journals/pdfs/Critical%20Arts/cajv6n1/caj006001004.pdf |title=Language and National Unity in a Post-Apartheid South Africa |author=Eric P.

Northern Sotho, which appears largely to be a taxonomic holding category for what is Sotho-Tswana but neither identifiably Southern Sotho nor Tswana,&lt;ref&gt;See Doke, Clement M. (1954). ''The Southern Bantu Languages. Handbook of African Languages''. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; subsumes highly varied [[dialect]]s including Pedi (''Sepedi''), Tswapo (''Setswapo''), Lovedu (''Khilobedu''), Pai and Pulana. Maho (2002) leaves the "East Sotho" varieties of Kutswe, Pai, and Pulana unclassified within Sotho-Tswana.

Lozi is spoken in [[Zambia]] and northeastern [[Namibia]] (in the [[Caprivi Strip|Caprivi]]). It is distinct from the other Sotho-Tswana languages due to heavy linguistic influences from [[Luyaana language|Luyaana]], and possibly other Zambian and Caprivi languages. In the Guthrie work&amp;mdash;as is now widely acknowledged&lt;ref&gt;Gowlett, Derek. (2003). Zone S. In D. Nurse &amp; G. Philippson (eds.), ''The Bantu Languages'', 609-638. London: Curzon/Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;Lozi was misclassified as K.21.

{{Translation sidebar}}

A '''target text''' ('''TT''') is a translated text written in the intended [[Target language (translation)|target language]], which is the result of a translation from a given [[source text]].  According to Jeremy Munday's definition of translation, "the process of translation between two different written languages involves the changing of an original written text (the source text or ST) in the original verbal language (the source language or SL) into a written text (the target text or TT) in a different verbal language (the target language or TL)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Translation Studies: theories and applications (4th ed.)|last=Munday|first=Jeremy|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-1138912557|location=London/New York|pages=8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms 'source text' and 'target text' are preferred over 'original' and 'translation' because they do not have the same positive vs. negative value judgment.

Translation scholars including [[Eugene Nida]] and [[Peter Newmark]] have represented the different approaches to translation as falling broadly into source-text-oriented or target-text-oriented categories.{{sfn|Munday|2016|pp=67-74}}

'''Western Khmer''', also known as '''Chanthaburi Khmer''', is the dialect of the [[Khmer language]] spoken by the [[Khmer people]] native to the [[Cardamom Mountains]] on both sides of the border between western [[Cambodia]] and eastern [[Central Thailand|Central]] [[Thailand]] ([[Chanthaburi Province]]).

'''Zeynalabdin Shirvani''' ({{lang-fa|زین‌العابدین شیروانی}}) (16 August 1780, [[Shamakhy]]—1838, near [[Jeddah]]), also known as '''Tamkin''', was a [[Persian people|Persian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pellat|first1=prepared by a number of leading orientalists ; edited by ...

==Early life==
Shirvani was born to a family of a Muslim cleric Isgandar Shirvani in [[Shamakhy]] (then the capital of the [[Shirvan Khanate]], now a city in [[Azerbaijan]]). In 1785 the family moved to [[Karbala]] (present-day [[Iraq]]) where Zeynalabdin Shirvani was admitted to a religious school and studied mostly [[Islam]]ic subjects as well as [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Turkic languages]] ([[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani Turkic]], [[Turkish language|Anatolian Turkish]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]]). In 1796, he moved to [[Baghdad]] where he spent a year studying geography, literature, philosophy, medicine, astronomy, and mathematics. At the age of 17, he went on his first journey. By the end of his life he will have travelled over 60,000 kilometres within 37 years.

==Travels==
Zeynalabdin Shirvani had keen interest in exploring [[Asia]] and almost never visited [[Europe]]. He was attached to his homeland and turned down many offers of local lords who were fascinated by his erudition and wanted him to settle on their lands (in Egypt, Turkey, etc.).

During his first journey, Shirvani visited what is now [[Azerbaijan]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://etnolingvistika.ru/saryi-shusha-karabah-kabala-gyandzh-i-baylakan.html Russian source describes Shirvani's theories on various place names in Azerbaijan]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]], and [[Bangladesh]].

His second journey included Iran, [[Oman]], [[Yemen]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Sudan]] (he is considered the last Eurasian to visit the independent Kingdom of [[Darfur]] in 1820), [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Egypt]], [[Levant|the Levant]], and [[Turkey]].

Finally, on his third journey he travelled to [[Bulgaria]], [[Greece]], Turkey, Azerbaijan, Iran, and Iraq.

In between those journeys, Shirvani also went on several small trips within Iran and Azerbaijan. He wrote reflections on all of his travels in three main works&lt;ref&gt;[http://etnolingvistika.ru/sochineniya-shirvani.html Details of Shirvani's main works (in Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt; (all of them in [[Persian language|Persian]]):

*'''''Riyadh as-Sayahat''''' (''The Flower Garden of Journeys''). It consists of two volumes written in 1822 and 1827 respectively. Parts of the book are now kept at the [[British Museum]] and the St Petersburg branch of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. Volume I contains brief historical overview of Iran (including a complete list of ancient and medieval royal dynasties, and biographies of [[Mazdak]], [[Papak|Babak]] and of over 60 poets), as well as detailed geographic material on [[Iranian Azerbaijan]], [[Armenia]], [[Shirvan]], [[Talysh Khanate|Talysh]], [[Mughan]], [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], [[Gilan]], [[Kurdistan]], and [[Fars Province|Fars]]. Volume II (thought to have been lost but rediscovered in mid-20th century) contains similar information on [[Central Asia]], Turkey, [[Arabia]] and India.
*'''''Hadaiq as-Sayahat''''' (''The Gardens of Journeys'') is an alphabetised list of geographic localities (including states, cities and rivers) in the [[Middle East]], and their detailed description. Shirvani worked on this book for 30 years. The copies of ''Hadaiq as-Sayahat'' are kept at the British Museum, the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] and a private library in Iran.
*'''''Bustan as-Sayahat''''' (''The Flower Bed of Journeys''). This book was written in 1832 but was first published 65 years later. In the first three chapters of the book, the author talks about prominent Middle Eastern scholars, literati and clergy. The fourth chapter contains geographic, cultural and ethnographic information on virtually all regions visited by Shirvani. In ''Bustan as-Sayahat'', he also mentioned countries he did not visit (mainly [[Russia]], [[France]], [[Austria]] and the [[United States]]) but has done research based on written sources of the time, as well as on his discussions with the scholars. At the end of the book, Shirvani introduces an educational program aimed at encouraging wealthy classes to sponsor education for talented youths who came from poor families, and proposed ways of facilitating living conditions for lower classes. The copies of this book are kept in the [[United Kingdom]], Russia, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and Iran.

==Philosophical &amp; Other Works==
As well as his famous travel works, Shirvani also composed the '''''Kashf ul-Maarif''''' (''The Discovery of Enlightenment''), a rather philosophical piece of writing. It consists of Shirvani's biography in the preface, his meetings with famous scholars, and their beliefs and theories. The only copy of the book that is known to have survived to our era was discovered by Azerbaijani historian [[Agamir Guliyev]] in [[Kabul]] in 1973. The book was never published and the manuscript remained at Guliyev's private library.

Some scholars believe that Shirvani wrote a biographical reflection on the great Sufi poet [[Rumi]] under the pen name Rahmat Ali Shah. The work was not published during Shirvani's lifetime but was later used in the introduction of an 1895 Bombay edition of the [[Masnavi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://etnolingvistika.ru/sochineniya-shirvani.html Details of the Rumi work (in Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that Shirvani warned readers that inaccurate statements might have been included in his works as he was often persecuted by Islamic feudals who regarded his books as a "threat to the religion". In one case, a study on which he had been working for 25 years was stolen from him and burned by Muhammad Qasim of Gumsha. It took Shirvani a long time to partially restore the lost data.

==Family==
Shirvani got married in [[Shiraz]] in the early 1820s. He had two sons one of whom died early and the other, Husamaddin Ali, followed his fathers footsteps and also became a geographer.

In 1838, Shirvani planned a [[hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]] but died of an unknown disease on a ship near [[Jeddah]] (present-day Saudi Arabia), where he was buried.
