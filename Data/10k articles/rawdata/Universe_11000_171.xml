== Test and trials ==
The boat was launched on  9 November 2016. After that multiple sets of tests and trials were conducted to verify the operational characteristics and safety standards of the boat.
* '''Optimisation Trials''' - to refine the settings in the internal software to ensure higher efficiency in the solar energy conversion and propulsion system, the tests was done on 13 and 14 November 2016 with the experts from France.
* '''Builders Trials''' - done on 15 November 2016, to ensure the systems was functioning as per specifications.
* '''[[Indian Register of Shipping|IRS]] and Technical Committee Trials''' - done on 16 November 2016&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/solar-ferry-undergoes-successful-trials/article9366690.ece|title=Solar ferry undergoes successful trials|last=|first=|date=20 November 2016|website=|newspaper=The Hindu|access-date=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to verify the operation, speed, safety of the boat. The maximum speed was noted as 7.4 knots @ 90% propulsive power. The power needed to move the boat at cruise speed of 5.5 knots was 15&amp;nbsp;kW. The boat was also tested for redundancy trials by shutting down one system and checked whether using one system the boat can still move at cruise speed of 5.5 knots. Other manoeuvring tests were also done.
* '''Client Trials''' - done on  25 November 2016,&lt;ref name="DeccanChronicle"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/in-other-news/261116/kerala-first-solar-ferry-ride-a-success.html|title=First solar ferry ride a success|last=|first=|date=26 November 2016|website=|newspaper=Deccan Chronicle|access-date=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2016/nov/26/commuters-get-ready-for-more-sun-kissed-rides-on-the-waters-1542697.html|title=Commuters, get ready for more sun-kissed rides on the waters|last=|first=|date=26 November 2016|website=|newspaper=New Indian Express|access-date=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with Transport Minister Sri. [[A. K. Saseendran]], Aroor MLA Sri. [[A. M. Ariff]], Vaikom MLA [[C. K. Asha]]. The performance was satisfactory for the dignitaries as well as the operators of the [[Kerala State Water Transport Department]]. The Transport Minister proclaimed that 14 more such ferries are planned this year.&lt;ref name="DeccanChronicle" /&gt;
* '''Site Trials''' - done at Vaikom to Thavanakkadavu route in presence of Technical committee, [[Indian Register of Shipping|IRS]] and Kerala Port surveyor from morning to evening. As per the specifications, 22 trips was done with full load and it was satisfactory.

== Technical features ==
The 20-metre-long and 7-metre-wide boat is covered by {{convert|140|m2}} of [[solar panels]] rated at 20&amp;nbsp;kW, which in turn connect to two [[electric motors]] of 20&amp;nbsp;kW, one in each [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]. There are 700&amp;nbsp;kg of lithium-ion batteries in the ship's two hulls with a total capacity of 50&amp;nbsp;kWh. The [[catamaran]] hull and its shape allow it to reach speeds of up to 7.5&amp;nbsp;[[Knot (unit)|knots]]. This was verified by [[Indian Register of Shipping]] surveyor, Kerala Port surveyor and technical committee. The hull was designed based on extensive experience of Navgathi&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navgathi.com Navgathi]&lt;/ref&gt; and AltEn&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternativesenergies.com AltEn]&lt;/ref&gt; and extensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was done to determine its [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamics]]. The boat is designed to be used as a passenger ferry to operate between Vaikom and Thavanakadavu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.destination-kerala.com/2016/07/01/navalt-spreading-ripples-of-eco-friendliness/|title=NavAlt Spreading Ripples of Eco-friendliness|website=Destination Kerala|access-date=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal operating speed is 5.5 knots (10&amp;nbsp;km/h) to achieve a 15-minute travel time between [[Vaikom]] and Thavanakkadavu, a distance of 2.5&amp;nbsp;km on water. For achieving this speed, the power needed is about 16&amp;nbsp;kW. During manoeuvring, when leaving the jetty or approaching it, about 22&amp;nbsp;kW of power are needed. Hence, on an average about 20&amp;nbsp;kW power is needed. The total running time, neglecting the time in jetty for embarkation and disembarkation of passengers, is 5.5 hours on a sunny day (depending on client needs).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Although the maximum power needed is a total of 22&amp;nbsp;kW during manoeuvring and 16&amp;nbsp;kW under cruise, more than double the power, a total of 40&amp;nbsp;kW, is provided in two motors of 20&amp;nbsp;kW each. The two systems on either side of the boat (in each demi-Hull) are electrically independent to ensure redundancy in case of system failure in one. Even if one system fails the power is available to safely cruise to shore with other. Also, unlike diesel engines, since efficiency does not drop with load, the electric motors can normally operate at 50% load and in emergencies at 100%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For higher safety standards and reliability, the vessel is built under [[Indian Register of Shipping]] rules for inland vessels and operating conditions of the [[Vaikom]] – Thavanakkadavu route. The boat construction is complete and was tested by Technical committee, [[Indian Register of Shipping]] surveyor and Kerala Port surveyor on 16 November 2016, near in backwaters at Aroor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2016/nov/18/vembanad-lake-to-set-sail-first-solar-powered-boat-1540138.html|title=Indian Express|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boat is registered in Kodungallur Port under Kerala Ports.

The boat is remotely monitored and trouble shooting can also be done remotely. All the operating parameters of the boat are recorded and transmitted to the NavAlt Solar and Electric Boats&lt;ref name="NavAlt Solar and Electric Boats"/&gt; server from where the technical experts can monitor the boat. The upgrades and settings in the software can also be performed remotely as if a computer is plugged on the boat. This makes the boat even more safe.

The project cost was US$370,000.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.solartoday.co.in/News/Cruising-through-the-sun/98761|title=Solar Today - India's first magazine dedicated to the emerging Solar industry|website=www.solartoday.co.in|access-date=2016-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scoopwhoop.com/Soon-These-Solar-Powered-Boats-Could-Ferry-People-Along-Keralas-Backwaters/|title=Kerala’s Backwaters Will Soon Have India’s First Solar Powered Boats|last=TK|first=Sreeraj|website=ScoopWhoop|language=En|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|author=|date=30 May 2016|url=http://indiaclimatedialogue.net/2016/05/30/solar-powered-ferry-debut-sunlit-kerala/|title=Solar-powered ferry to debut in sunlit Kerala|website=India Climate Dialogue|access-date=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety features ==
The boat satisfies the [[Indian Register of Shipping]]'s safety requirement of being able to maintain cruise speed with one set of propulsion shut down.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Energy balance as per the Specifications ==
[[File:Energy balance.png|thumb|500x500px]]The total energy needed to operate the ferry for 5.5 hours is 110 kWh (20&amp;nbsp;kW is average power). 1&amp;nbsp;kW solar panels produce 4 kWh of energy per day, factoring the system efficiency and standard sun of the location of 5.72 (average throughout the year). Hence the energy from solar panels is 80 kWh. The gap in energy is provided by lithium battery that can provide up to 40 kWh (80% discharge) from a total capacity of 50 kWh. The lithium batteries are fully charged in the morning because of overnight grid charging.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A trip between the two boat points takes 15 minutes and it needs energy of 5 kWh. Hence a total of 22 trips can be made daily transporting 1,650 people daily, or 580,000 people every year without burning fuel.

'''Trips on average sunny day: 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM (running hours 5.5 hours)'''

The below table describes the 22 trips in each column, and for each trip the start time and end time. It also list the break time at the end of each trip. In non-peak hours this is about 15 minutes, in peak time it is 10 minutes and around noon it is two hours. The energy from sun is cumulative at the end of the period and for an average sunny day it is about 72 kWh from 18&amp;nbsp;kW panels (the rest is for auxiliary systems and charges a different battery bank). The battery state of charge (SOC) is shown at the beginning of trip and end of trip. At the end of the day, the battery has about 20% charge left. The energy use can be further optimised by adding one more trip (5 kWh usage) so that end of day battery SOC can be 10%.

On a cloudy day, the no. of trips is reduced and the break time is increased. If it is very cloudy in the break time, then shore charging can be done. This is a 32A charger and charges at 7&amp;nbsp;kW. Hence in the three hour break, it can charge battery by 21 kWh.

Compared to a conventional boat powered by diesel with same functional features and safety standards which costs 231,000 US$, the solar ferry costs 370,000 US$. An efficient conventional boat consumes 120 litres per day (12 litres per hour), or 3,500 litres per month and 42,000 litres per year of diesel. This amounts to 39,000 US$ for diesel (@ 0.93 US$/litre) and total operating costs including lube oil and other maintenance costs amounts to 44,600 US$ per year.

The operating cost of solar ferry is 40 units of electricity or 6.2 US$ per day which amounts to 185 US$ per month and 2,150 US$ per year.

The pay-back period is under three years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Government of India under the leadership of Prime Minister, Sri. [[Narendra Modi]] is very supportive of the project and the [[Ministry of New and Renewable Energy]] has also agreed to sponsor the project considering that this is a first of its kind in India. The benefit of sponsorship would mean that [[Kerala State Water Transport Department]] would get the boat at almost free of cost. In this scenario the boat is cheaper than conventional boat and they would start saving money from day one.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Diamond==
{{main|Diamond}}

'''Diamond''' is a well known allotrope of carbon. The [[hardness]] and high [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion of light]] of diamond make it useful for both industrial applications and jewelry. Diamond is the hardest known natural [[mineral]]. This makes it an excellent abrasive and makes it hold polish and luster extremely well. No known naturally occurring substance can cut (or even scratch) a diamond, except another diamond.

The market for industrial-grade diamonds operates much differently from its gem-grade counterpart. Industrial diamonds are valued mostly for their hardness and heat conductivity, making many of the [[gemology|gemological]] characteristics of diamond, including clarity and color, mostly irrelevant. This helps explain why 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 100 million carats or 20 tonnes annually) are unsuitable for use as gemstones and known as ''[[bort]]'', are destined for industrial use. In addition to mined diamonds, [[synthetic diamond]]s found industrial applications almost immediately after their invention in the 1950s; another 400 million carats (80 tonnes) of synthetic diamonds are produced annually for industrial use, which is nearly four times the mass of natural diamonds mined over the same period.

The dominant industrial use of diamond is in [[Diamond cutting|cutting]], [[Diamond drilling|drilling]] ([[drill bit]]s), [[Diamond grinding|grinding]] (diamond edged cutters), and polishing. Most uses of diamonds in these technologies do not require large diamonds; in fact, most diamonds that are not gem-quality can find an industrial use. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades, or ground into a powder for use in grinding and polishing applications (due to its extraordinary hardness). Specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for high pressure experiments (see [[diamond anvil]]), high-performance [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], and limited use in specialized [[window]]s.

With the continuing advances being made in the production of synthetic diamond, future applications are beginning to become feasible. Garnering much excitement is the possible use of diamond as a [[semiconductor]] suitable to build [[integrated circuit|microchip]]s from, or the use of diamond as a [[heat sink]] in [[electronics]]. Significant research efforts in [[Japan]], [[Europe]], and the [[United States]] are under way to capitalize on the potential offered by diamond's unique material properties, combined with increased quality and quantity of supply starting to become available from synthetic diamond manufacturers.

Each carbon atom in a diamond is covalently bonded to four other carbons in a [[tetrahedron]]. These tetrahedrons together form a 3-dimensional network of six-membered carbon rings (similar to [[cyclohexane]]), in the [[chair conformation]], allowing for zero [[bond angle]] strain. This stable network of [[covalent bonds]] and hexagonal rings is the reason that diamond is so strong.  Although graphite is the most stable allotrope of carbon under standard laboratory conditions (273 or 298 K, 1 atm), a recent computational study indicated that under idealized conditions (''T'' = 0, ''p'' = 0), diamond is the most stable allotrope by 1.1 kJ/mol compared to graphite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grochala|first=Wojciech|date=2014-04-01|title=Diamond: Electronic Ground State of Carbon at Temperatures Approaching 0 K|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201400131/abstract|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|language=en|volume=53|issue=14|pages=3680–3683|doi=10.1002/anie.201400131|issn=1521-3773|pmid=24615828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graphite==
{{main|Graphite}}
'''Graphite''', named by [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] in 1789, from the Greek γράφειν (''graphein'', "to draw/write", for its use in pencils) is one of the most common allotropes of carbon. Unlike diamond, graphite is an electrical conductor. Thus, it can be used in, for instance, electrical arc lamp electrodes. Likewise, under [[standard conditions]], graphite is the most stable form of carbon. Therefore, it is used in thermochemistry as the [[standard state]] for defining the [[standard enthalpy of formation|heat of formation]] of carbon compounds.

Graphite [[Electrical conductor|conducts electricity]], due to [[delocalization]] of the [[pi bond]] [[electron]]s above and below the planes of the carbon atoms. These electrons are free to move, so are able to conduct electricity. However, the electricity is only conducted along the plane of the layers. In diamond, all four outer electrons of each carbon atom are 'localised' between the atoms in covalent bonding. The movement of electrons is restricted and diamond does not conduct an electric current. In graphite, each carbon atom uses only 3 of its 4 outer energy level electrons in covalently bonding to three other carbon atoms in a plane. Each carbon atom contributes one electron to a delocalised system of electrons that is also a part of the chemical bonding. The delocalised electrons are free to move throughout the plane. For this reason, graphite conducts electricity along the planes of carbon atoms, but does not conduct in a direction at right angles to the plane.

Graphite powder is used as a dry [[lubricant]]. Although it might be thought that this industrially important property is due entirely to the [[cleavage (crystal)|loose interlamellar coupling]] between sheets in the structure, in fact in a [[vacuum]] environment (such as in technologies for use in [[Outer space|space]]), graphite was found to be a very poor lubricant. This fact led to the discovery that graphite's lubricity is due to [[adsorbed]] air and water between the layers, unlike other layered dry lubricants such as [[molybdenum disulfide]]. Recent studies suggest that an effect called [[superlubricity]] can also account for this effect.

When a large number of crystallographic defects bind these planes together, graphite loses its lubrication properties and becomes what is known as [[pyrolytic carbon]], a useful material in blood-contacting implants such as [[prosthetic]] [[heart valve]]s.

Graphite is the most stable allotrope of carbon. Contrary to popular belief, high-purity graphite does not readily burn, even at elevated temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22aTqTKRPBI Glowing nuclear reactor graphite 2]. YouTube (2007-11-07). Retrieved on 2015-10-22.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, it is used in [[nuclear reactor]]s and for high-temperature crucibles for melting metals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artisanfoundry.co.uk/store/index.php?cPath=26&amp;osCsid=932b7bbb45af1524a27fd64a7709dd8e Crucibles, Artisan Foundry Shop]. Artisanfoundry.co.uk. Retrieved on 2015-10-22.&lt;/ref&gt; At very high temperatures and pressures (roughly 2000&amp;nbsp;°C and 5 GPa), it can be transformed into diamond.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Natural and crystalline graphites are not often used in pure form as structural materials due to their shear-planes, brittleness and inconsistent mechanical properties.

In its pure glassy (isotropic) synthetic forms, [[pyrolytic graphite]] and [[carbon fiber]] graphite are extremely strong, heat-resistant (to 3000&amp;nbsp;°C) materials, used in reentry shields for missile nosecones, [[solid rocket]] engines, [[Pebble-bed reactor|high temperature reactors]], [[brake]] shoes and [[electric motor]] [[Brush (electric)|brushes]].

Intumescent or expandable graphites are used in fire seals, fitted around the perimeter of a fire door. During a fire the graphite intumesces (expands and chars) to resist fire penetration and prevent the spread of fumes. A typical start expansion temperature (SET) is between 150 and 300&amp;nbsp;°C.

Density: graphite's specific gravity is 2.3, which makes it lighter than diamonds.

Chemical activity: it is slightly more reactive than diamond. This is because the reactants are able to penetrate between the hexagonal layers of carbon atoms in graphite. It is unaffected by ordinary solvents, dilute acids, or fused alkalis. However, [[chromic acid]] oxidises it to carbon dioxide.

===Graphene===
{{main|Graphene}}
A single layer of graphite is called [[graphene]] and has extraordinary electrical, thermal, and physical properties. It can be produced by [[epitaxy]] on an insulating or conducting substrate or by mechanical exfoliation (repeated peeling) from graphite. Its applications may include replacing [[silicon]] in high-performance electronic devices. With two layers stacked, [[bilayer graphene]] results with different properties.

===AA'-graphite===
[[AA'-graphite]] is an allotrope of carbon similar to graphite, but where the layers are positioned differently to each other as compared to the order in graphite.

==Amorphous carbon==
{{main|Amorphous carbon}}
'''Amorphous carbon''' is the name used for [[carbon]] that does not have any [[crystal]]line structure. As with all [[Amorphous solid|glassy]] materials, some short-range order can be observed, but there is no long-range pattern of atomic positions. While entirely amorphous carbon can be produced, most amorphous carbon actually contains microscopic crystals of [[graphite]]-like,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Randall L. Vander Wal|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19970023067.pdf |title=Soot Precursor Material: Spatial Location via Simultaneous LIF-LII Imaging and Characterization via TEM |year=1996 |publisher=The Combustion Institute |work=Twenty-sixth Symposium (International) on Combustion |pages=2269–2275}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even [[diamond]]-like carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/goldbook/D01673.html|title=IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology 2nd Edition |year=1997|chapter= diamond-like carbon films|doi=10.1351/goldbook.D01673|isbn=0-9678550-9-8|editor1=McNaught, A. D.|editor2=Wilkinson, A.|publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications|place= Oxford }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coal]] and [[soot]] or [[carbon black]] are informally called amorphous carbon. However, they are products of [[pyrolysis]] (the process of decomposing a substance by the action of heat), which does not produce true amorphous carbon under normal conditions.

==Nanocarbons==

===Buckminsterfullerenes===
{{Nanomat}}
{{main|Fullerene}}
The ''buckminsterfullerenes'', or usually just ''fullerenes'' or ''buckyballs'' for short, were discovered in 1985 by a team of scientists from Rice University and the University of Sussex, three of whom were awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. They are named for the resemblance to the geodesic structures devised by [[Buckminster Fuller|Richard Buckminster "Bucky" Fuller]]. Fullerenes are positively curved molecules of varying sizes composed entirely of carbon, which take the form of a hollow sphere, ellipsoid, or tube.

As of the early twenty-first century, the chemical and physical properties of fullerenes are still under heavy study, in both pure and applied research labs. In April 2003, fullerenes were under study for potential medicinal use&amp;nbsp;— binding specific antibiotics to the structure to target resistant bacteria and even target certain cancer cells such as melanoma.

===Carbon nanotubes===
{{main|Carbon nanotube}}

Carbon nanotubes, also called buckytubes, are cylindrical [[carbon]] [[molecules]] with novel properties that make them potentially useful in a wide variety of applications (e.g., nano-electronics, [[optics]], [[materials science|materials]] applications, etc.). They exhibit extraordinary strength, unique [[electricity|electrical]] properties, and are efficient conductors of [[heat]]. [[Inorganic nanotubes]] have also been synthesized.
A nanotube is a member of the [[fullerene]] structural family, which also includes [[Buckyball (molecule)|buckyballs]]. Whereas buckyballs are [[spherical]] in shape, a nanotube is [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]], with at least one end typically capped with a hemisphere of the buckyball structure. Their name is derived from their size, since the diameter of a nanotube is on the order of a few [[nanometer]]s (approximately 50,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair), while they can be up to several centimeters in length. There are two main types of nanotubes: [[single-walled nanotubes]] (SWNTs) and [[MWNT|multi-walled nanotubes]] (MWNTs).

===Carbon nanobuds===
[[File:NanobudComputations70%.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Computer models of stable nanobud structures]]
{{main|Carbon nanobud}}
'''Carbon nanobuds''' are a newly discovered allotrope of [[carbon]] in which [[fullerene]] like "buds" are covalently attached to the outer sidewalls of the [[carbon nanotubes]]. This hybrid material has useful properties of both fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. For instance, they have been found to be exceptionally good [[field emission|field emitters]].

=== Schwarzites ===
Schwarzites are negatively curved carbon molecules. (A negatively curved object bends inwards like a saddle rather than bending outwards like a sphere.)

The team that first created schwarzites did not recognize them as such. Instead they were called zeolite-templated carbons (ZTCs). The name derives from their origin  inside the pores of [[zeolite]]s, crystalline [[silicon dioxide]] minerals. Another team recognized them as schwarzites and refined the original synthesis technique. A vapor of carbon-containing molecules is injected into the zeolite, where the carbon gathers on the pores' inner walls. It forms a 2D sheet that pulls inwards, creating the negative curve. Dissolving the zeolite leaves the carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newatlas.com/schwarzite-carbon-nanostructure-negative-curvature/55882|title=Negative curvature schwarzite rounds out trinity of carbon nanostructures|last=Irving|first=Michael|date=August 13, 2018|website=newatlas.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glassy carbon==
[[File:Glassy carbon and a 1cm3 graphite cube HP68-79.jpg|thumb|left|A large sample of glassy carbon.]]
{{main|Glassy carbon}}
'''Glassy carbon''' or '''vitreous carbon''' is a class of non-graphitizing [[carbon]] widely used as an electrode material in [[electrochemistry]], as well as for high-temperature crucibles and as a component of some prosthetic devices.

It was first produced by Bernard Redfern in the mid-1950s at the laboratories of The Carborundum Company, Manchester, UK. He had set out to develop a polymer matrix to mirror a diamond structure and discovered a resole (phenolic) resin that would, with special preparation, set without a catalyst. Using this resin the first glassy carbon was produced.

The preparation of glassy carbon involves subjecting the organic precursors to a series of heat treatments at temperatures up to 3000&amp;nbsp;°C. Unlike many non-graphitizing carbons, they are impermeable to gases and are chemically extremely inert, especially those prepared at very high temperatures. It has been demonstrated that the rates of oxidation of certain glassy carbons in oxygen, carbon dioxide or water vapour are lower than those of any other carbon. They are also highly resistant to attack by acids. Thus, while normal [[graphite]] is reduced to a powder by a mixture of concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids at room temperature, glassy carbon is unaffected by such treatment, even after several months.

==Atomic and diatomic carbon==
{{main|Atomic carbon|diatomic carbon}}
Under certain conditions, carbon can be found in its atomic form. It is formed by passing large electric currents through carbon under very low pressures. It is extremely unstable, but it is an intermittent product used in the creation of [[carbene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.colby.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1239&amp;context=honorstheses Reactions of Atomic Carbon with Acid Chlorides]. None. Retrieved on 2011-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diatomic carbon]] can also be found under certain conditions. It is often detected via [[spectroscopy]] in extraterrestrial bodies, including [[comet]]s and certain [[star]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Harwit|title=Astrophysical concepts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trAAgqWZVlkC|accessdate=24 November 2011|year=1998|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-94943-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2009/04feb_greencomet/ Green Comet Approaches Earth].

==Carbon nanofoam==
{{main|Carbon nanofoam}}
'''Carbon nanofoam''' is the fifth known allotrope of carbon, discovered in 1997 by [[Andrei V. Rode]] and co-workers at the [[Australian National University]] in [[Canberra]]. It consists of a low-density cluster-assembly of carbon atoms strung together in a loose three-dimensional web.

Each cluster is about 6 nanometers wide and consists of about 4000 carbon [[atom]]s linked in [[graphite]]-like sheets that are given negative curvature by the inclusion of [[heptagon]]s among the regular [[hexagon]]al pattern. This is the opposite of what happens in the case of [[buckminsterfullerene]]s, in which carbon sheets are given positive curvature by the inclusion of [[pentagon]]s.

The large-scale structure of carbon nanofoam is similar to that of an [[aerogel]], but with 1% of the density of previously produced [[Aerogel#Carbon|carbon aerogels]] – only a few times the density of [[air]] at [[sea level]]. Unlike carbon aerogels, carbon nanofoam is a poor [[electrical conductivity|electrical conductor]].

==Carbide-derived carbon==
{{main|Carbide-derived carbon}}
Carbide-derived carbon (CDC) is a family of carbon materials with different surface geometries and carbon ordering that are produced via selective removal of metals from metal carbide precursors, such as TiC, SiC, Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C, etc. This synthesis is accomplished using chlorine treatment, hydrothermal synthesis, or high-temperature selective metal desorption under vacuum. Depending on the synthesis method, carbide precursor, and reaction parameters, multiple carbon allotropes can be achieved, including endohedral particles composed of predominantly amorphous carbon, carbon nanotubes, epitaxial graphene, nanocrystalline diamond, onion-like carbon, and graphitic ribbons, barrels, and horns. These structures exhibit high porosity and specific surface areas, with highly tunable pore diameters, making them promising materials for supercapacitor-based energy storage, water filtration and capacitive desalinization, catalyst support, and cytokine removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/adfm.201002094|title=Carbide-Derived Carbons – From Porous Networks to Nanotubes and Graphene|year=2011|author2= Heon, Min |author3=Gogotsi, Yury|journal=Advanced Functional Materials|volume=21|pages=810–833|last=Presser|first=Volker|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond)==
{{main|Lonsdaleite}}
'''Lonsdaleite''' is a [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] allotrope of the carbon allotrope [[diamond]], believed to form from [[graphite]] present in [[meteor]]ites upon their impact to [[Earth]]. The great heat and stress of the impact transforms the graphite into diamond, but retains graphite's hexagonal [[crystal lattice]]. Hexagonal diamond has also been synthesized in the laboratory, by compressing and heating graphite either in a static press or using explosives. It can also be produced by the thermal decomposition of a polymer, [[poly(hydridocarbyne)]], at atmospheric pressure, under inert gas atmosphere (e.g. argon, nitrogen), starting at temperature {{convert|110|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Diamond &amp; DLC from Preceramic Polymer"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bianconi P |year=2004 |title=Diamond and Diamond-like Carbon from a Preceramic Polymer |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=126 |issue=10 |pages=3191–3202 |pmid=15012149 |doi=10.1021/ja039254l |name-list-format=vanc |display-authors=1 |last2=Joray |first2=Scott J. |last3=Aldrich |first3=Brian L. |last4=Sumranjit |first4=Jitapa |last5=Duffy |first5=Daniel J. |last6=Long |first6=David P. |last7=Lazorcik |first7=Jason L. |last8=Raboin |first8=Louis |last9=Kearns |first9=James K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="facile synthesis"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/10601320801946108|title=Facile Synthesis of Poly(hydridocarbyne): A Precursor to Diamond and Diamond-like Ceramics|year=2008|author=Nur, Yusuf|journal=Journal of Macromolecular Science Part A|volume=45|page=358|last2=Pitcher|first2=Michael|last3=Seyyidoğlu|first3=Semih|last4=Toppare|first4=Levent|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="electrochemical polymerizatıon"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10853-009-3364-4|title=Electrochemical polymerizatıon of hexachloroethane to form poly(hydridocarbyne): a pre-ceramic polymer for diamond production|year=2009|author=Nur, Yusuf|journal=Journal of Materials Science|volume=44|page=2774|last2=Cengiz|first2=Halime M.|last3=Pitcher|first3=Michael W.|last4=Toppare|first4=Levent K.|bibcode = 2009JMatS..44.2774N|issue=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variability of carbon==
[[File:Diamond and graphite2.jpg|thumb|Diamond and graphite are two allotropes of carbon: pure forms of the same element that differ in structure.]]
The system of carbon allotropes spans an astounding range of extremes, considering that they are all merely structural formations of the same element.

Between diamond and graphite:
*Diamond crystallizes in the [[cubic (crystal system)|cubic system]] but graphite crystallizes in the [[hexagonal (crystal system)|hexagonal system]].
*Diamond is clear and transparent, but graphite is black and opaque.
*Diamond is the hardest mineral known (10 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]), but graphite is one of the softest (1–2 on [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]).
*Diamond is the ultimate abrasive, but graphite is soft and is a very good lubricant.
*Diamond is an excellent electrical insulator, but graphene is an excellent conductor.
*Diamond is an excellent thermal conductor, but some forms of graphite are used for thermal insulation (for example heat shields and firebreaks).
*At standard temperature and pressure, graphite is the thermodynamically stable form. Thus diamonds do not exist forever. The conversion from diamond to graphite, however, has a very high [[activation energy]] and is therefore extremely slow.

Despite the hardness of diamonds, the chemical bonds that hold the carbon atoms in diamonds together are actually weaker than those that hold together graphite. The difference is that in diamond, the bonds form an inflexible three-dimensional lattice. In graphite, the atoms are tightly bonded into sheets, but the sheets can slide easily over each other, making graphite soft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==History==
Manson studied at the [[London Guildhall University#City of London College|London College of Furniture]], where he completed a new course for stringed instrument makers. Such a course did not exist in [[England]] at the time and Manson was encouraged by the college to create his own course on becoming a [[luthier]]. He built his first instrument in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andymanson.com/aboutbio/ |title=About |author=Andy Manson |year=2012 |accessdate=29 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603032406/http://andymanson.com/aboutbio/ |archivedate=3 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manson started a workshop in 1969 in [[Sussex|Sussex, UK]].

In the early 1980s, Manson was joined by his brother Hugh Manson, who focused on building electric guitars and basses. The two of them moved workshop to [[Devon|Devon, England]] in 1985.

Andy Petherick and Simon Smidmore, former associates of Andy Manson's, went on to found Brook Guitars, where they produce some of his regular designs under licence.&lt;ref name=Custom/&gt;&lt;ref name=Illustrated/&gt;

==Notable works==
In 1974, Manson created a now iconic instrument for [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] of [[Led Zeppelin]]. The instrument featured three necks: six and 12 string guitar and mandolin. The instrument was used extensively during Led Zeppelin's acoustics sets throughout the mid to late 70's. The story of the creation of this guitar can be found in Manson's book ''Talking Wood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andy Manson|title= Talking Wood, a guitar maker's diary |year= 1998 |publisher= R&amp;D Associates |location=Tiverton|isbn= 9780951751213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones has continued using Manson through the years.

In 1994, Manson was commissioned to make a [[Multi-neck guitar|triple-neck]] guitar for [[Jimmy Page]]. It was used during the [[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded|Unledded]] performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.led-zeppelin.org/joomla/studio-and-live-gear/241 |title=Manson Triple Neck Acoustic Instrument |author= |date= |work= |publisher=www.led-zeppelin.org |accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8196">'''CALPHAD''' stands for ''CALculation of PHAse Diagrams'', a methodology which has been introduced in the previous century by Larry Kaufman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/851391370|title=Thermodynamic Data, Models, and Phase Diagrams in Multicomponent Oxide Systems : an Assessment for Materials and Planetary Scientists Based on Calorimetric, Volumetric and Phase Equilibrium Data|last=B.|first=Fabrichnaya, Olga|date=2004|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|others=Saxena, Surendra K., Richet, Pascal, Westrum, Edgar F.|isbn=9783662105047|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|oclc=851391370}}&lt;/ref&gt; An equilibrium [[phase diagram]] is usually a diagram with axes for temperature and [[chemical composition|composition]] of a chemical system. It shows the regions where substances or solutions (i.e. phases) are stable and regions where two or more of them coexist. Phase diagrams are a very powerful tool for predicting the state of a system under different conditions and were initially a graphical method to rationalize experimental information on states of equilibrium. In complex systems, computational methods such as CALPHAD are employed to model thermodynamic properties for each phase and simulate multicomponent phase behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/663969016|title=Computational thermodynamics : the CALPHAD method|last=L.|first=Lukas, H.|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Fries, Suzana G., Sundman, Bo.|isbn=0521868114|location=Cambridge|oclc=663969016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CALPHAD approach is based on the fact that a phase diagram is a manifestation of the equilibrium [[List of thermodynamic properties|thermodynamic properties]] of the system, which are the sum of the properties of the individual phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/960196125|title=Computational thermodynamics of materials|last=Zi-Kui.|first=Liu,|others=Wang, Yi. (Writer on thermodynamics)|isbn=9780521198967|location=Cambridge|oclc=960196125}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus possible to calculate a phase diagram by first assessing the thermodynamic properties of all the phases in a system.

==Methodology==
With the CALPHAD method one collects all experimental information on phase equilibria in a system and all thermodynamic information obtained from thermochemical and thermophysical studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/851391370|title=Thermodynamic Data, Models, and Phase Diagrams in Multicomponent Oxide Systems : an Assessment for Materials and Planetary Scientists Based on Calorimetric, Volumetric and Phase Equilibrium Data|last=B.|first=Fabrichnaya, Olga|date=2004|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|others=Saxena, Surendra K., Richet, Pascal, Westrum, Edgar F.|isbn=9783662105047|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|oclc=851391370}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thermodynamic properties of each phase are then described with a mathematical model containing adjustable parameters.  The parameters are evaluated by optimizing the fit of the model to all the information, also involving coexisting phases.  It is then possible to recalculate the phase diagram as well as the thermodynamic properties of all the phases. The philosophy of the CALPHAD method is to obtain a consistent description of the phase diagram and the thermodynamic properties so to reliably predict the set of stable phases and their thermodynamic properties in regions without experimental information and for [[metastable]] states during simulations of [[phase transformation]]s. 

===Thermodynamic modeling of a phase===
There are two crucial factors for the success of the CALPHAD method. The first factor is to find realistic as well as convenient mathematical models for the [[Gibbs energy]] for each phase. The Gibbs energy is used because most experimental data have been determined at known temperature and pressure and any other thermodynamic quantities can be calculated from it.  It is not possible to obtain an exact description of the behavior of the Gibbs energy of a multi-component system with analytical expressions. It is thus necessary to identify the main features and base the mathematical models on them. The discrepancy between model and reality is finally represented by a power series expansion in temperature, pressure and constitution of the phase. The adjustable parameters of these model descriptions are refined to reproduce the experimental data. The strength of the CALPHAD method is that the descriptions of the constituent sub-systems can be combined to describe a multi-component system.  

===Equilibrium calculations===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CALPHADex.jpg|thumb|right|Calculated Fe-1.5Cr-3Ni-0.5Mn-0.3Si-C phase diagram with the CALPHAD method]] --&gt;
The second crucial factor is the availability of computer software for calculating equilibria and various kinds of diagrams and databases with the stored assessed information.  As there are at present many different kinds of models used for different kinds of phases there are several thermodynamic databases available, either free or commercially, for different materials like steels, super-alloys, [[semiconductor]] materials, [[aqueous solution]]s, [[slag]]s, etc. There are also several different kinds of software available using different kinds of algorithms for computing the equilibrium. It is an advantage if the software allows the equilibrium to be calculated using many different types of conditions for the system, not only the temperature, pressure and overall composition because in many cases the equilibrium may be determined at constant volume or at a given [[chemical potential]] of an element or a given composition of a particular phase.

==Applications==
CALPHAD had a slow start in the 60s but sophisticated thermodynamic data bank systems started to appear in the 80s and today there are several commercial products on the market, e.g. FactSage, MTDATA, PANDAT, MatCalc, JMatPro, and Thermo-Calc as well as the [[Free_software|free]] implementation OpenCalphad [http://www.opencalphad.com/]. They are used in research and industrial development (e.g., QuesTek Innovations' PrecipiCalc software and ''Materials by Design'' Technology), where they save large amounts of time and resources by reducing the experimental work and by making thermodynamic predictions available for multi-component systems that would be practically unattainable without this approach. There is a journal with this name where recent scientific achievements are published but scientific papers describing the use of the CALPHAD methods are published also in many other journals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1020">A '''cascade converter''' is a type of [[motor-generator]] which was patented in 1902 by '''J. L. la Cour''' and '''O. S. Bragstad'''.

It consists of an [[induction motor]] driving a [[dynamo]] through a shaft.  In addition, the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] of the induction motor is electrically connected to the [[armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] of the dynamo.

When the machine is running, half the power is transmitted mechanically through the shaft while the other half is transmitted electrically.  

The advantage of this arrangement is that the machine can be smaller than a conventional motor-generator of the same power.

The [[United Kingdom|British]] manufacturing rights for the cascade converter were held by [[Bruce Peebles &amp; Co. Ltd.]] of [[Edinburgh]].

A '''coaling tower''', '''coal stage''' or '''coaling station''' is a facility used to load [[coal]] as fuel into railway [[steam locomotive]]s. Coaling towers were often sited at [[motive power depot]]s or locomotive maintenance shops.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.michiganrailroads.com/RRHX/CoalFacilities/CoalFacilitiesMenu.htm | work= | accessdate=August 27, 2010 | title=Coal facility}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coaling towers were constructed of wood, steel-reinforced concrete, or steel. In almost all cases coaling stations used a [[gravity]] fed method, with one or more large storage bunkers for the coal elevated on columns above the railway tracks, from which the coal could be released to slide down a [[chute (gravity)|chute]] into the waiting locomotive's coal storage area. The method of lifting the bulk coal into the storage bin varied. The coal usually was dropped from a hopper car into a pit below tracks adjacent to the tower. From the pit a conveyor-type system used a chain of motor-driven buckets to raise the coal to the top of the tower where it would be dumped into the storage bin; a skip-hoist system lifted a single large bin for the same purpose.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some facilities lifted entire railway coal trucks or wagons. Sanding pipes were often mounted on coaling towers to allow simultaneous replenishment of a locomotive's sand box.

As railroads transitioned from the use of steam locomotives to the use of [[diesel locomotive]]s in the 1950s the need for coaling towers ended. Many reinforced concrete towers remain in place if they do not interfere with operations due to the high cost of [[demolition]] incurred with these massive structures.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4038">'''Copolyester''' forms when modifications are made to [[polyesters]], which are combinations of [[diacid]]s and [[diol]]s. For example, by introducing other diacids, such as [[isophthalic acid]] (IPA), or other diols, such as [[cyclohexane dimethanol]] (CHDM) to the polyester [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET), the material becomes a copolyester due to its comonomer content.&lt;ref name="Jaarsma"&gt;''Copolyester – A Versatile Choice for Medical Applications'' Thijs Jaarsma. 2004. Business Briefing: Medical Device Manufacturing &amp; Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

Copolyesters retain their strength, clarity, and other mechanical properties even when exposed to a variety of chemicals that typically affect other materials, such as [[polycarbonate]]s. This, plus their versatility and flexibility, allows manufacturers to use them effectively in the design of both high-volume, low-cost parts as well as critical, more expensive component parts.

==Applications==
Copolyesters offer versatility to meet a wide variety of applications.&lt;ref name="Jaarsma" /&gt;
Copolyester resins have proved to be effective in [[packaging]] applications, due to their toughness, versatility and chemical resistance. They are  also frequently used in the manufacture and packaging of [[consumer goods]] and materials. Markets that rely on copolyesters include medical packaging, [[home appliances]], consumer goods (pens, toys, sporting goods, etc.), and [[cosmetics]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071016145742/http://eastman.com/Brands/Eastar/Introduction/ Eastman - EASTAR copolyester - Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071016145758/http://eastman.com/Brands/Eastar/Products/ Eastman - EASTAR copolyester - Product List]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bostik-us.com/our-brands/vitel/default.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316160118/http://www.bostik-us.com/our-brands/vitel/default.html |archivedate=2011-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dynapol.com/product/dynapol/en/products-services/dynapol-types/dynapol-series/pages/default.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=John Scheirs|first=Timothy E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7196">In [[mathematical analysis]], a '''domain''' is any [[connected (topology)|connected]] [[open set|open subset]] of a finite-dimensional vector space. This is a different concept than the [[domain of a function]], though it is often used for that purpose, for example in [[partial differential equations]] and [[Sobolev space]]s.

Various degrees of smoothness of the boundary of the domain are required for various properties of functions defined on the domain to hold, such as integral theorems ([[Green's theorem]], [[Stokes theorem]]), properties of [[Sobolev space]]s, and to define [[Measure (mathematics)|measures]] on the boundary and spaces of [[Trace operator|traces]] (generalized functions defined on the boundary). Commonly considered types of domains are domains with [[continuous function|continuous]] boundary, [[Lipschitz domain|Lipschitz boundary]], [[Smooth function|''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] boundary, and so forth.

A '''Bounded domain''' is a domain which is a [[bounded set]], while an '''Exterior''' or '''external domain''' is the [[Interior (topology)|interior]] of the [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of a bounded domain.

In [[complex analysis]], a '''complex domain''' (or simply '''domain''') is any connected open subset of the [[complex plane]] ℂ. For example, the entire complex plane is a domain, as is the open [[unit disk]], the open [[upper half-plane]], and so forth.  Often, a complex domain serves as the [[domain of a function|domain of definition]] for a [[holomorphic function]].

In the study of [[several complex variables]], the definition of a domain is extended to include any connected open subset of ℂ''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''.

==Historical notes==
{{quote
|text='''Definition'''. Eine offene Punktmenge heißt zusammenhängend, wenn man sie nicht als Summe von zwei offenen Punktmengen darstellen kann. Eine offene zusammenhängende Punktmenge heißt ein Gebiet.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-en|"An open set is connected if it cannot be expressed as the sum of two open sets. An open connected set is called a domain"}}: in this definition, Carathéodory considers obviously [[Empty set|non empty]] [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] sets.&lt;/ref&gt;

|sign= [[Constantin Carathéodory]]
|source={{Harv|Carathéodory|1918|p=222}}
}}

According to [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Hahn|1921|loc=p. 85 footnote 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of a domain as an open connected set was introduced by [[Constantin Carathéodory]] in his famous book {{harv|Carathéodory|1918}}. Hahn also remarks that the word "''Gebiet''" ("''Domain''") was occasionally previously used as a [[synonym]] of [[open set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hahn|1921|loc = p. 61 footnote 3}}, commenting the just given definition of open set ("offene Menge"), precisely states:-"''Vorher war, für diese Punktmengen die Bezeichnung "Gebiet" in Gebrauch, die wir (§ 5, S. 85) anders verwenden werden.''" (Free English translation:-"''Previously, the term "Gebiet" was occasionally used for such point sets, and it will be used by us in (§ 5, p. 85) with a different meaning.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the term "domain" was occasionally used to identify closely related but slightly different concepts. For example, in his influential [[monograph]]s on [[elliptic partial differential equation]]s, [[Carlo Miranda]] uses the term "region" to identify an open connected set,&lt;ref name="M&amp;Mp1"&gt;See {{harvs|last= Miranda|year1=1955|year2=1970|loc1=p. 1|loc2=p. 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Precisely, in the first edition of his monograph, {{harvtxt|Miranda|1955|p=1}} uses the Italian term "''campo''", meaning literally "field" in a way similar to [[Field (agriculture)|its meaning in agriculture]]: in the second edition of the book, Zane C. Motteler appropriately translates this term as "region".&lt;/ref&gt; and reserves the term "domain" to identify an internally connected,&lt;ref&gt;An internally connected set is a set whose interior is connected.&lt;/ref&gt; [[perfect set]], each point of which is an accumulation point of interior points,&lt;ref name="M&amp;Mp1"/&gt; following his former master [[Mauro Picone]]:&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Picone|1922|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; according to this convention, if a set {{math|''A''}} is a region then its [[Closure (topology)|closure]] {{math|''{{overline|A}}''}} is a domain.&lt;ref name="M&amp;Mp1" /&gt;

'''''Energy Autonomy: The Economic, Social &amp; Technological Case for Renewable Energy''''' is a 2006 book written by [[Hermann Scheer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ecologist, Volume 37|date=2007|publisher=[[The Ecologist]]|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CdlFAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Energy+Autonomy%22+Scheer&amp;dq=%22Energy+Autonomy%22+Scheer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mRC-U6L_Mc2lyATPvoKABw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published on December 1, 2006 through [[Routledge]] and discusses the topic of renewable energy.

==Synopsis==
In the book Scheer discusses that for the past two hundred years industrial civilization has relied predominantly upon [[fossil fuels]], which are abundant and cheap but also have adverse social and environmental effects. Scheer argues that it would be more beneficial if they transition to [[renewable energy]] and distributed, decentralized energy generation, as this is a model that has already been proven to be successful. Much progress with [[renewable energy commercialization]] has already been made in Europe where the renewable energy industry is a multi-billion Euro industry with high growth rates.

==Reception==
Critical reception has been mostly positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kapoor|first1=Rakesh|title=Energy Autonomy: The Economic, Social and Technological Case for Renewable Energy (review)|journal=[[Futures (journal)|Futures]]|date=2009|volume=41|issue=9|pages=665–668|doi=10.1016/j.futures.2009.04.002|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328709000640|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Doctors for the Environment Australia'' gave the book a favorable review, commenting that "''Energy Autonomy'' is engagingly written, well referenced, with informative tables and a good index."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Book Review: Energy Autonomy.

'''Enrico Fermi Nuclear Power Plant''' was a [[nuclear power plant]] at [[Trino]] (often referred to as ‘Trino Vercellese’, meaning ‘Trino in the [[Province of Vercelli]]’), in north-west [[Italy]].

Consisting of one 260 [[megawatt]] [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) from the vendor [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]], it operated from 1964 until 1990. Trino was in 1964 the third ever commercially operated PWR worldwide, and it had the second highest megawatt-capacity of them. It was closed down following the [[Italian nuclear power referendum, 1987]].

The experimental [[Uranium enrichment|enrichment plant]], [[EUREX]], near the power plant,  was closed down in 1984.

'''Harrison Ngau Laing''' is a Malaysian [[environmentalist]] and politician, a member of the [[Kayan people (Borneo)|Kayan tribe]]. He was awarded the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] in 1990 for his work to prevent [[deforestation]] of the [[Sarawak]] region. He was a member of the [[Parliament of Malaysia|Malaysian Parliament]] from 1990 to 1995.

==Life and career==
Harrison Ngau was born in 1959 at his home village in Long Keseh, which is located near the [[Baram River]] in the northen region of [[Sarawak]]. In 1976, a logging company named WTK (short form for the company's founder, Wong Tuong Kwang) went to his village. Harrison was a 17 year old boy who just had just completed second last year of his secondary school at [[Marudi]]. He went back to his village for a Christmas holiday when a large meeting convened in his longhouse. The villagers only realised that WTK company had just been granted a concession behind their longhouse when the company turned up with bulldozers, heavy machinaries, and chainsaws in front of them. The villagers initially mooted the idea of stopping the loggers, however when company workers sent them some free biscuits and [[Coca-Cola|Coke]], the villagers accepted the food and the resistance died down. It was later turned out that two villagers in the longhouse own shares in another logging company who owned the concession. They sold to concession to WTK and made a handsome profit. Since Harrison was the only one who know how write, he offered himself to write letters to the company. WTK later agreed to pay a compensation of RM 2 (US$ 0.60) for every tonne of timber taken from their area.&lt;ref name="Money Logging"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lukas |first1=Straumann |title=Money Logging On the Trail of the Asian Timber Mafia |date=2014 |publisher=[[Bergli Books]] |location=Basel, Switzerland |isbn=978-3-905252-72-9 |pages=111-116 |edition=First |url=https://books.google.com.my/books/about/Money_Logging.html?id=-F8aCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Harrison&amp;f=false |accessdate=2 November 2018 |language=English |chapter= Chapter 5 -  Blowpipes against bulldozers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison then went on to work in a hotel in [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]], an ice factory, and with Shell oil company. In 1980, he started Sarawak branch of Sahabat Alam Malaysia (SAM), an environmental and human rights organisation in Malaysia. He went to Marudi rented a office for his organisation. In November 1980, he was married to 17 year old Uding, another Kayan from a nearby village. They raised four children and continue to campaigned against logging companies in Baram region. The first protest was at the Apoh river against the Samling logging company. The Kayans from three longhouses went to threatened the company's employees. The company then agreed to pay compensation to the three longhouses. Harrison's organisation was primarily involved in advising the indigenous people in exercising their land rights. In the mid 1980s, the [[Penan people]] started turn up to his office when they themselves were also affected by logging.&lt;ref name="Money Logging"/&gt;

The biggest protest came in March 1987 when 4,700 indigenous people from 26 Penan villages and six longhouses turned up simultaneously to prevent loggers from reaching upper Baram and [[Limbang]] region. Around 200 bulldozers and 1,600 timber workers were held up for several months. After a few months, the blockade was forcefully dismantled by the police. On 27 October 1987, [[Operation Lalang]] was started by the then Malaysian prime minister, [[Mahathir Mohamad]]. Harrison was arrested under [[Internal Security Act 1960|Internal Secruity Act]]. Harrison was flown to Miri and spent a night at a cell there before he was transported to [[Kuching]] through an off-road vehicle. He was held for 60 days and nights but no charge was brought against him. Harrison was released in December 1987. Harrison's arrest brought attention to environmental campaigners and human rights activists worldwide. They wrote letters to protest the Malaysian government actions.  One year later, SAM received "Right Livelihood Award" for Harrison's work in Sarawak.&lt;ref name="Money Logging"/&gt;

Harrison received [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] in 1990. He later used the prize money to fund his campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/recipient/harrison-ngau-laing/|title=Harrison Ngau Laing Asia 1990 Goldman Prize Recipient|publisher=[[Goldman Environmental Prize]]|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goldman&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/124 |title=Asia 1990.

'''Ice IX''' is a form of solid [[water]] stable at temperatures below 140 [[Kelvin|K]] and pressures between 200 and 400 [[MPa]]. It has a [[tetragonal]] crystal lattice and a density of 1.16 g/cm³, 26% higher than ordinary ice. It is formed by cooling [[ice III]] from 208 K to 165 K (rapidly&amp;mdash;to avoid forming [[ice II]]). Its structure is identical to ice III other than being hydrogen-ordered.{{clarify|date=December 2017}}

Ordinary [[ice|water ice]] is known as [[ice Ih|ice I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;]] in the [[Percy Williams Bridgman|Bridgman]] nomenclature. Different types of ice, from [[ice II]] to [[ice XVI]], have been created in the laboratory at different temperatures and pressures.

'''Johari-Goldstein relaxation''', also known as the JG β-relaxation, is a universal property of [[glasses]] and certain other disordered materials. 
Initially posited in 1969 by Martin Goldstein, its existence was proved experimentally by Gyan P. Johari and Martin Goldstein in 1970 by experiments on glasses made from rigid molecules.
The relaxation, a peak in mechanical or [[dielectric]] loss at a particular frequency, had previously been attributed to a type of molecular flexibility.  The fact that such a loss peak shows up in glasses of rigid molecules lacking this flexibility demonstrated its universal character.
The JG relaxation is regarded as the precursor of the α-relaxation, i.e., its occurrence facilitates viscous flow, and it must occur before the latter can occur. Accordingly, the narrow ε″ peak observed at GHz frequencies in the spectra of polar liquids at high temperatures is associated with processes similar to the JG relaxation that is observed at lower temperatures. As the liquid is cooled, the ε″ peak at GHz frequency broadens and shifts to lower frequencies. A new peak
in ε″ emerges from the low frequency side of this peak once some value of higher density and viscosity are reached. The relaxation time at which it emerges is typically 0.1 to 1 μs. As the liquid is further
cooled, this peak broadens and grows in strength at the expense of the original peak and rapidly moves to very low frequencies at T &lt; Tg from above. This is the α-relaxation peak. Its relaxation rate changes more rapidly on cooling than the rate of JG relaxation and the motions that produce it become kinetically frozen at Tg while the motions due to the JG relaxation persist. In the glassy state, its mechanism is seen to be thermally activated hindered reorientation, the same as that in a low viscosity liquid at high temperatures. The discovery was made by Johari and Goldstein in the period 1970-1976  and these observations have now been confirmed by a number of authors on many types of systems. The relative amplitudes of the JG process and the α processes in terms of dielectric strength have also been given in some cases.
It is known that viscosity and density of a liquid also increase as a liquid polymerizes at a fixed T and macromolecular structure grows in the liquid as covalent bonds replace weaker Van der Waals interactions. More recently, it has been shown by dielectric measurements that during polymerization, the α-relaxation process emerges from the JG relaxation at a fixed T as monomeric liquids polymerize under isothermal conditions, i.e., the viscosity of the liquid increases irreversibly until it becomes a glass isothermally. As polymerization progresses, the ε″ peak observed in the GHz frequency
range for the monomeric liquid begins to decrease in strength while its position does not change significantly. A new ε″ peak that corresponds to the α-relaxation evolves on the low frequency side,
increases in strength, and shifts to lower frequency as the viscosity increases. As polymerization occurs, the decrease in Δε for the high frequency relaxation with time has the same form as the decrease in Δε_JG as structural relaxation occurs during isothermal annealing.

'''John Frederic Daniell''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (12 March 1790 &amp;ndash; 13 March 1845) was an [[England|English]] [[chemist]] and [[physicist]].

==Biography==
Daniell was born in [[London]]. In 1831 he became the first professor of chemistry at the newly founded [[King's College London]]; and in 1835 he was appointed to the equivalent post at the [[East India Company]]'s [[Addiscombe Military Seminary|Military Seminary at Addiscombe, Surrey]].&lt;ref name="vibart"&gt;{{cite book |first=H.M. |last=Vibart |title=Addiscombe: its heroes and men of note |place=Westminster |publisher=Archibald Constable |year=1894 |page=133 |url=https://archive.org/stream/addiscombeitsher00viba#page/132/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt; His name is best known for his invention of the [[Daniell cell]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions]]'', 1836.&lt;/ref&gt; an element of an [[Battery (electricity)|electric battery]] much better than [[voltaic cell]]s. He also invented the dew-point [[hygrometer]] known by his name,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Quarterly Journal of Science]]'', 1820.&lt;/ref&gt; and a register [[pyrometer]];&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical Transactions'', 1830.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1830 he erected in the hall of the [[Royal Society]] a water-[[barometer]], with which he carried out a large number of observations.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical Transactions'', 1832.&lt;/ref&gt; A process devised by him for the manufacture of illuminating gas from turpentine and resin was in use in [[New York City]] for a time.

In 1842 he was awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Civil Law|Doctorate of Civil Law]] by the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name="vibart"/&gt;

==Publications==
Daniell's publications included ''Meteorological Essays'' (1823), an ''Essay on Artificial Climate considered in its Applications to Horticulture'' (1824), which showed the necessity of a humid atmosphere in hothouses devoted to tropical plants, and an ''Introduction to the Study of Chemical Philosophy'' (1839).

==Lectures==
In 1840 he was invited to deliver the [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Royal Institution Christmas Lecture]] on ''The First Principles of Franklinic Electricity''.

==Death and commemoration==
Daniell died suddenly of [[apoplexy]] in London in March 1845, while attending a meeting of the council of the Royal Society, of which he had become a fellow in 1813 and Foreign Secretary in 1839.

The [[lunar crater]] [[Daniell (crater)|Daniell]] is named in his honour.

{{nihongo|'''Jōyō'''|常陽}} is a test [[sodium-cooled fast reactor]] located in [[Ōarai, Ibaraki]], [[Japan]], operated by the [[Japan Atomic Energy Agency]].  The name comes from the previous country name of the area around Ibaraki.

It was made with the purpose of doing tests on and advancing the development of that type of reactor, as an irradiation test facility for construction materials. It also does tests with the nuclear fuel as well as activation experiments.

The reactor has gone through 3 different core changes.
*MK-I April 24, 1977 - January 1, 1982 (the power was 50-75 MWt)
*MK-II November 22, 1982 - September 12, 1997. This core surpassed 50,000 hours of operating time with 100 MWt.
*MK-III July 2, 2003–2007 (140-150 MWt).

The current core provides the neutron flux of 4×10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for E&gt;0.1 MeV.

After an incident in 2007, the reactor is suspended for repairing, recovery works were planned to be completed in 2014.

Following the closure of the unsuccessful follow-on [[fast breeder reactor]] [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant|Monju]] in 2016, a decision was made to continue research at Jōyō.&lt;ref name=nei-20161004&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsjapan-to-continue-fast-reactor-development-without-monju-5023427/ |title=Japan to continue fast reactor development without Monju |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=4 October 2016 |accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bohr radius|size]] of [[helium]] atoms relative to their spacing is shown to scale under 1950 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]] of pressure. The atoms have a certain, average speed, slowed down here two [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] fold from room temperature.]]

The '''kinetic theory of gases''' describes a [[gas]] as a large number of submicroscopic [[particle]]s ([[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s), all of which are in constant, rapid, [[randomness|random]] [[motion (physics)|motion]]. The randomness arises from the particles' many collisions with each other and with the walls of the container.

Kinetic theory of gases explains the [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] properties of gases, such as pressure, temperature, viscosity, [[thermal conductivity]], and volume, by considering their molecular composition and motion. The theory posits that gas pressure results from particles' collisions with the walls of a container at different velocities.

Kinetic molecular theory defines temperature in its own way, in contrast with the [[temperature|thermodynamic definition]].&lt;ref name="C &amp; C"/&gt;

Under an [[optical microscope]], the molecules making up a liquid are too small to be visible. However, the jittery motion of pollen grains or dust particles in liquid are visible. Known as [[Brownian motion]], the motion of the pollen or dust results from their collisions with the liquid's molecules.

==History==

In approximately 50 [[before common era|BCE]], the     Roman philosopher [[Lucretius]] proposed that apparently static macroscopic bodies were composed on a small scale of rapidly moving atoms all bouncing off each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Maxwell|first1=J.

In 1738 [[Daniel Bernoulli]] published ''[[Hydrodynamica]]'', which laid the basis for the kinetic theory of gases.  In this work, Bernoulli posited the argument, still used to this day, that gases consist of great numbers of molecules moving in all directions, that their impact on a surface causes the gas pressure that we feel, and that what we experience as [[heat]] is simply the [[kinetic energy]] of their motion. The theory was not immediately accepted, in part because [[conservation of energy]] had not yet been established, and it was not obvious to physicists how the collisions between molecules could be perfectly elastic.&lt;ref name="PonomarevKurchatov1993"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Quantum Dice|author1=L.I Ponomarev|author2=I.V Kurchatov|date=1 January 1993|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-7503-0251-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|36–37}}

Other pioneers of the kinetic theory (which were neglected by their contemporaries) were [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] (1747),&lt;ref&gt;Lomonosov 1758&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges-Louis Le Sage]] (ca. 1780, published 1818),&lt;ref&gt;Le Sage 1780/1818&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Herapath]] (1816)&lt;ref&gt;Herapath 1816, 1821&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John James Waterston]] (1843),&lt;ref&gt;Waterston 1843&lt;/ref&gt; which connected their research with the development of [[mechanical explanations of gravitation]]. In 1856 [[August Krönig]] (probably after reading a paper of Waterston) created a simple gas-kinetic model, which only considered the translational motion of the particles.&lt;ref&gt;Krönig 1856&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857 [[Rudolf Clausius]], according to his own words independently of Krönig, developed a similar, but much more sophisticated version of the theory which included translational and contrary to Krönig also rotational and vibrational molecular motions. In this same work he introduced the concept of [[mean free path]] of a particle.
&lt;ref&gt;Clausius 1857&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, after reading a paper on the diffusion of molecules by [[Rudolf Clausius]], Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] formulated the [[Maxwell distribution]] of molecular velocities, which gave the proportion of molecules having a certain velocity in a specific range.&lt;ref&gt;See:

In 1871, [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] generalized Maxwell's achievement and formulated the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. Also the [[logarithm]]ic connection between [[entropy]] and [[probability]] was first stated by him.

In the beginning of the twentieth century, however, atoms were considered by many physicists to be purely hypothetical constructs, rather than real objects. An important turning point was [[Albert Einstein]]'s (1905)&lt;ref&gt;Einstein 1905&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marian Smoluchowski]]'s (1906)&lt;ref&gt;Smoluchowski 1906&lt;/ref&gt;
papers on [[Brownian motion]], which succeeded in making certain accurate quantitative predictions based on the kinetic theory.

==Assumptions==
The theory for ideal gases makes the following assumptions:

* The gas consists of very small particles known as molecules. This smallness of their size is such that the total [[volume]] of the individual gas molecules added up is negligible compared to the volume of the smallest open ball containing all the molecules. This is equivalent to stating that the average distance separating the gas particles is large compared to their [[atomic radius|size]].
* These particles have the same [[mass]].
* The number of molecules is so large that statistical treatment can be applied.

* The rapidly moving particles constantly collide among themselves and with the walls of the container. All these collisions are perfectly elastic. This means the molecules are considered to be perfectly spherical in shape and elastic in nature.
* Except during collisions, the [[interaction]]s among molecules are negligible. (That is, they exert no [[force]]s on one another.) 
:This implies:
::1. [[Special relativity|Relativistic]] effects are negligible.
::2. [[Quantum mechanics|Quantum-mechanical]] effects are negligible. This means that the [[mean inter-particle distance|inter-particle distance]] is much larger than the [[thermal de Broglie wavelength]] and the molecules are treated as [[classical mechanics|classical]] [[physical body|objects]].
::3. Because of the above two, their dynamics can be treated classically. This means that the equations of motion of the molecules are time-reversible.

* The average kinetic energy of the gas particles depends only on the [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]] of the [[system]]. The kinetic theory has its own definition of temperature, not identical with the thermodynamic definition.
* The elapsed time of a collision between a molecule and the container's wall is negligible when compared to the time between successive collisions.
* There are negligible gravitational force on molecules.

More modern developments relax these assumptions and are based on the [[Boltzmann equation]]. These can accurately describe the properties of dense gases, because they include the volume of the molecules. The necessary assumptions are the absence of quantum effects, [[molecular chaos]] and small gradients in bulk properties. Expansions to higher orders in the density are known as [[virial expansion]]s.

An important book on kinetic theory is that by [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Chapman]] and [[Thomas Cowling|Cowling]].&lt;ref name="C &amp; C"&gt;[[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Chapman, S.]], [[Cowling, T.G.]] (1939/1970).&lt;/ref&gt; An important approach to the subject is called [[Chapman–Enskog theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Kauzmann, W. (1966). ''Kinetic Theory of Gasses'', W.A. Benjamin, New York, pp. 232–235.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been many modern developments and there is an alternative approach developed by Grad based on moment expansions.&lt;ref&gt;Grad 1949&lt;/ref&gt;
In the other limit, for extremely rarefied gases, the gradients in bulk properties are not small compared to the mean free paths. This is known as the Knudsen regime and expansions can be performed in the [[Knudsen number]].

==Equilibrium properties==
=== {{anchor|Pressure and Kinetic Energy}}Pressure and kinetic energy===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pressure]] --&gt;
In kinetic model of gases, the [[pressure]] is equal to the force exerted by the atoms hitting and rebounding from a unit area of the gas container surface. Consider a gas of ''N'' molecules, each of mass ''m'', enclosed in a cube of volume ''V'' = ''L''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. When a gas molecule collides with the wall of the container perpendicular to the ''x'' axis and bounces off in the opposite direction with the same speed (an [[elastic collision]]), the change in [[momentum]] is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = p_{i,x} - p_{f,x} = p_{i,x} - (-p_{i,x}) = 2 p_{i,x} = 2 mv_x,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'' is the momentum, ''i'' and ''f'' indicate initial and final momentum (before and after collision), ''x'' indicates that only the ''x'' direction is being considered, and ''v'' is the speed of the [[particle]] (which is the same before and after the collision).

The particle impacts one specific side wall once every

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t = \frac{2L}{v_x},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''L'' is the distance between opposite walls.

The [[force]] due to this particle is

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{m v_x^2}{L}.&lt;/math&gt;

The total force on the wall is

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{Nm\overline{v_x^2}}{L},&lt;/math&gt;

where the bar denotes an average over the ''N'' particles.

Since the motion of the particles is random and there is no bias applied in any direction, the average squared speed in each direction is identical:

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{v_x^2} = \overline{v_y^2} = \overline{v_z^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

By [[Pythagorean theorem]] in three dimensions the total squared speed ''v'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{v^2} = \overline{v_x^2} + \overline{v_y^2} + \overline{v_z^2},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{v^2} = 3\overline{v_x^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{v_x^2} = \frac{\overline{v^2}}{3},&lt;/math&gt;

and the force can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{Nm\overline{v^2}}{3L}.&lt;/math&gt;

This force is exerted on an area ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, the pressure of the gas is

:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{F}{L^2} = \frac{Nm\overline{v^2}}{3V},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' = ''L''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is the volume of the box.

In terms of the kinetic energy of the gas ''K'':

:&lt;math&gt;PV = \frac{2}{3} \times{K}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a first non-trivial result of the kinetic theory because it relates pressure, a [[macroscopic]] property, to the  (translational) [[kinetic energy]] of the molecules &lt;math&gt;N\frac{1}{2} m\overline{v^2}&lt;/math&gt;, which is a [[microscopic]] property.

===Temperature and kinetic energy===

Rewriting the above result for the pressure as &lt;math&gt;PV = {Nm\overline{v^2}\over 3} &lt;/math&gt;, 
we may combine it with the [[ideal gas law]]

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle PV = N k_B T ,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle k_B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle T&lt;/math&gt; the
[[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute]] [[temperature]] defined by the ideal gas law, to obtain

:&lt;math&gt;k_B T  =   {m\overline{v^2}\over 3} &lt;/math&gt;,

which leads to simplified expression of the average kinetic energy per molecule,&lt;ref&gt;The average kinetic energy of a fluid is proportional to the [[Root-mean-square speed|root mean-square velocity]], which always exceeds the mean velocity - [http://www.mikeblaber.org/oldwine/chm1045/notes/Gases/Kinetic/Gases08.htm Kinetic Molecular Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;   \displaystyle     \frac {1} {2} m\overline{v^2} =  \frac {3} {2}  k_B T&lt;/math&gt;.

The kinetic energy of the system is N times that of a molecule, namely &lt;math&gt; K= \frac {1} {2} N m \overline{v^2} &lt;/math&gt;.
Then the temperature &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle T&lt;/math&gt; takes the form

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;   \displaystyle    T   =   {m\overline{v^2}\over 3 k_B}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

which becomes

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;   \displaystyle    T   =   \frac   {2}   {3}   \frac   {K}   {N k_B}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
Eq.({{EquationNote|3}})
is one important result of the kinetic
theory:
''The average molecular kinetic energy is proportional to the ideal gas law's absolute temperature''.
From Eq.({{EquationNote|1}}) and
Eq.({{EquationNote|3}}),
we have
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   PV 
   =
   \frac
   {2}
   {3}
   K.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}
Thus, the product of pressure and
volume per [[Mole (unit)|mole]] is proportional to the average
(translational) molecular kinetic energy.

Eq.({{EquationNote|1}}) and Eq.({{EquationNote|4}})
are called the "classical results",
which could also be derived from [[statistical mechanics]];
for more details, see:&lt;ref&gt;
[http://clesm.mae.ufl.edu/wiki.pub/index.php/Configuration_integral_%28statistical_mechanics%29 Configuration integral (statistical mechanics)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428193950/http://clesm.mae.ufl.edu/wiki.pub/index.php/Configuration_integral_%28statistical_mechanics%29 |date=2012-04-28 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Since there are
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 3N&lt;/math&gt;
[[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] in a monatomic-gas system with
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle N&lt;/math&gt;
particles,
the kinetic energy per degree of freedom per molecule is
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   \frac
   {K}
   {3 N}
   =
   \frac
   {k_B T}
   {2}
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|5}}}}
In the kinetic energy per degree of freedom,
the constant of proportionality of temperature
is 1/2 times [[Boltzmann constant]] or R/2 per mole. In addition to this, the temperature will decrease when the pressure drops to a certain point.{{why?|date=June 2014}}
This result is related
to the [[equipartition theorem]].

As noted in the article on [[heat capacity]], diatomic
gases should have 7 degrees of freedom, but the lighter diatomic gases act
as if they have only 5. Monatomic gases have 3 degrees of freedom.

Thus the kinetic energy per kelvin (monatomic [[ideal gas]]) is 3 [R/2] = 3R/2:
* per mole: 12.47 J
* per molecule: 20.7 yJ = 129 μeV.

At [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature]] (273.15 K), we get:
* per mole: 3406 J
* per molecule: 5.65 zJ = 35.2 meV.

===Collisions with container===
One can calculate the number of atomic or molecular collisions with a wall of a container per unit area per unit time.

Assuming an ideal gas, a derivation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.arizona.edu/~salzmanr/480a/480ants/collsurf/collsurf.html Collisions With a Surface&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; results in an equation for total number of collisions per unit time per area:

:&lt;math&gt;N^* = \frac{1}{4}\frac{N}{V} v_\text{avg} = \frac{n}{4} \sqrt{\frac{8 k_{B} T}{\pi m}}. &lt;/math&gt;

This quantity is also known as the "impingement rate" in vacuum physics.

===Speed of molecules===
From the kinetic energy formula it can be shown that

:&lt;math&gt;v_\text{p} = \sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{k_B T}{m}},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \bar v = \frac {2}{\sqrt{\pi}} v_p = \sqrt{\frac {8}{\pi} \cdot \frac{k_B T}{m}},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v_\text{rms} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} v_p = \sqrt{{3} \cdot \frac {k_B T}{m}},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' is in m/s, ''T'' is in kelvins, and ''m'' is the mass of one molecule of gas. The most probable (or mode) speed &lt;math&gt;v_\text{p}&lt;/math&gt; is 81.6% of the rms speed &lt;math&gt;v_\text{rms}&lt;/math&gt;, and the mean (arithmetic mean, or average) speed &lt;math&gt;\bar v&lt;/math&gt; is 92.1% of the rms speed ([[isotropy|isotropic]] [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution#Distribution of speeds|distribution of speeds]]).

==Transport properties==

The kinetic theory of gases deals not only with gases in thermodynamic equilibrium, but also very importantly with gases not in thermodynamic equilibrium. This means considering what are known as "transport properties", such a viscosity and thermal conductivity.

===Viscosity and kinetic momentum===
In books on elementary kinetic 
theory&lt;ref name="Sears1975"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sears|first1=F.W.|last2=Salinger|first2=G.L.|year=1975|title=Thermodynamics, Kinetic Theory, and Statistical Thermodynamics|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc.|location= Reading, Massachusetts, USA |edition=3|chapter=10|pages=286–291|isbn=978-0201068948}}&lt;/ref&gt;
one can find results for dilute gas modeling that has widespread use. 
Derivation of the kinetic model for shear viscosity usually starts by considering a [[Couette flow]] where two parallel plates are separated by a gas layer. The upper plate is moving at a constant velocity to the right due to a force F. The lower plate is stationary, and an equal and opposite force must therefore be acting on it to keep it at rest. The molecules in the gas layer have a forward velocity component &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; which increase uniformly with distance &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; above the lower plate. The non-equilibrium flow is superimposed on a [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution]] of molecular motions.

Let &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; be the collision [[Cross section (physics)#Collision among gas particles|cross section]] of one molecule colliding with another. The number density &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; is defined as the number of molecules per (extensive) volume &lt;math&gt; C = N/V &lt;/math&gt;. The collision cross section per volume or collision cross section density is &lt;math&gt; C \sigma &lt;/math&gt;, and it is related to the [[Mean free path#Mean free path in kinetic theory|mean free path]] &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; by 

&lt;math&gt; \quad l = \frac {1} {\sqrt{2} C \sigma} &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the unit of the collision cross section per volume &lt;math&gt; C \sigma &lt;/math&gt; is reciprocal of length. The mean free path is the average distance traveled by a molecule, or a number of molecules per volume, before they make their first collision.

Let &lt;math&gt; u_{0} &lt;/math&gt; be the forward velocity of the gas at an imaginary horizontal surface inside the gas layer. On the average, a molecule that crosses the surface makes its last collision before crossing at a distance equal to two-thirds of the mean free path (i.e. &lt;math&gt; 2l/3 &lt;/math&gt;) away from the surface. At this distance above and below the surface, the forward momentum of the molecule is respectively

&lt;math&gt; \quad p_{x}^{\pm} = m \left( u_{0} \pm \frac {2}{3} l {d u \over dy} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where m is the molecular mass. The molecular flux  &lt;math&gt; \Phi &lt;/math&gt; includes all molecules arriving at one side of an element of the surface within the gas layer. The incoming molecules are coming from all directions at the one side of the surface and with all speeds. This molecular flux (i.e. the number flux) is related to the average molecular speed &lt;math&gt; \bar v &lt;/math&gt; by

&lt;math&gt; \quad \Phi = \frac {1}{4} \bar v C &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the forward velocity gradient &lt;math&gt;du/dy&lt;/math&gt; can be considered to be constant over a distance of mean free path. Next we multiply by the total flux to get the change of momentum per unit time and per unit area, that is carried by the molecules crossing from either above or below the surface area. This gives the equation

&lt;math&gt; \quad \Phi p_{x}^{\pm} = \frac {1}{4} \bar v C \cdot m \left( u_{0} \pm \frac {2}{3} l {d u \over dy} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

The net rate of momentum per unit area that is transported across the imaginary surface is thus

&lt;math&gt; \quad \tau = \Phi p_{x}^{+}  - \Phi p_{x}^{-} = \frac {1}{3} \bar v C m \cdot l {d u \over dy} &lt;/math&gt;

The defining equation for the (shear) viscosity &lt;math&gt; \eta &lt;/math&gt; of the gas is

&lt;math&gt; \quad \frac {F} {A} = \eta {d u \over dy} &lt;/math&gt;

Combining the above kinetic equation with defining equation for (shear) viscosity by &lt;math&gt; \tau = F/A &lt;/math&gt; gives the equation for shear viscosity, which is usually denoted &lt;math&gt; \eta_{0} &lt;/math&gt; when it is a dilute gas:

&lt;math&gt; \quad \eta_{0} = \frac {1} {3} \bar v C m l &lt;/math&gt;

Combining this equation with the equation for mean free path gives

&lt;math&gt; \quad \eta_{0} = \frac {1} {3 \sqrt{2} } \frac {m \cdot \bar v} {\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

From statistical thermodynamics for gases we have equations relating average molecular speed to most likely speed and further to temperature. These statistical results gives the average (equilibrium) molecular speed as

&lt;math&gt; \quad \bar v = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} v_{p} = 2 \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi} \cdot \frac {k_{B}T}{m_{}}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v_{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the most probable speed, &lt;math&gt; k_{B} &lt;/math&gt; is the Boltzmann constant. We note that

&lt;math&gt; \quad k_{B} \cdot N_{A} = R \quad \text{and} \quad M = m \cdot N_{A} &lt;/math&gt;

and insert the velocity in the viscosity equation above. This gives the well known equation for shear viscosity for dilute gases:

&lt;math&gt; \quad \eta_{0} = \frac {2} {3 \sqrt{\pi} } \cdot \frac {\sqrt{m k_{B} T}} { \sigma } 
= \frac {2} {3 \sqrt{\pi} } \cdot \frac {\sqrt{MRT}} { \sigma \cdot N_{A} } &lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is the molar mass. The equation above presupposes that the gas density is low (i.e. the pressure is low). This implies that the kinetic translational energy dominates over rotational and vibrational molecule energies. The viscosity equation further presupposes that there is only one type of gas molecules, and that the gas molecules are perfect elastic and hard core particles of spherical shape. This assumption of elastic, hard core spherical molecules, like billiard balls, implies that the collision cross section of one molecule can be estimated by

&lt;math&gt; \quad \sigma = \pi \left( 2 r \right)^2 = \pi d^2 &lt;/math&gt;

The radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is called collision cross section radius or kinetic radius, and the diameter &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is called collision cross section diameter or [[kinetic diameter]] of a molecule in a monomolecular gas. There are no simple general relation between the collision [[Cross section (physics)#Collision among particles|cross section]] and the hard core size of the (fairly spherical) molecule. The relation depends on shape of the potential energy of the molecule. For a real spherical molecule (i.e. a noble gas atom or a reasonably spherical molecule) the interaction potential is more like the [[Lennard-Jones potential]] or [[Morse potential]] which have a negative part that attracts the other molecule from distances longer than the hard core radius. [[Mean free path#Mean free path in kinetic theory|The radius for zero  Lennard-Jones potential]] is then appropriate to use as estimate for the kinetic radius.

'''MV ''Iron Baron''''' (formerly [[MV Ocean Express|MV ''Ocean Express'']] and MV ''Irrawaddy'') was a 37,557 [[Deadweight tonnage|dwt]] [[bulk carrier]] built in 1985. It was chartered by [[BHP Shipping]] in 1990.

On 10 July 1995 it was nearing the end of a voyage transporting 24,000 [[tonne]]s of [[manganese]] [[ore]] from [[Groote Eylandt]] via [[Port Kembla, New South Wales|Port Kembla]] to the port of [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] in northern [[Tasmania]], [[Australia]].  Weather conditions at the time were north-westerly 37–46 km/h (20–25 [[knot (unit)|knot]]) winds and two-metre seas. It grounded on Hebe Reef as it approached the mouth of the [[Tamar River (Tasmania)|Tamar River]] and began leaking [[Fuel oil#Bunker fuel|bunker fuel oil]].  The crew was safely evacuated.&lt;ref name=AMSA&gt;[http://www.amsa.gov.au/Marine_Environment_Protection/Major_oil_spills_in_australia/Iron_Baron/index.asp Australian Maritime Safety Authority – Major Oil Spills in Australia: Iron Baron, Hebe Reef, Tasmania, 10 July 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 July the ''Iron Baron'' was refloated and moved to an offshore anchorage.  Underwater inspections confirmed that it had incurred major structural damage and was continuing to deteriorate.  With further bad weather predicted, it was decided by BHP to dump the ship.  It was towed to an approved disposal site 85&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Flinders Island]] where it sank on 30 July.&lt;ref name=AMSA/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1732">The '''maximum ramp weight (MRW)''' (also known as the '''maximum taxi weight (MTW)''') is the maximum weight authorised for manoeuvring (taxiing or towing) an aircraft on the ground as limited by aircraft strength and airworthiness requirements. It includes the weight of taxi and run-up fuel for the engines and the [[auxiliary power unit]] (APU).

It is greater than the maximum takeoff weight due to the fuel that will be burned during the taxi and runup operations.

The difference between the maximum taxi/ramp weight and the maximum take-off weight (''maximum taxi fuel allowance'') depends on the size of the aircraft, the number of engines, APU operation, and engines/APU fuel consumption, and is typically assumed for 10 to 15 minutes allowance of taxi and run-up operations.

Given the problem of the [[aerodynamic]] [[design]] of the [[nose cone]] section of any vehicle or body meant to travel through a [[compressible fluid]] medium (such as a [[rocket]] or [[aircraft]], [[missile]] or [[bullet]]), an important problem is the determination of the [[nose cone]] geometrical shape for optimum performance. For many applications, such a task requires the definition of a [[solid of revolution]] shape that experiences minimal resistance to rapid motion through such a fluid medium, which consists of elastic particles.

== Nose cone shapes and equations ==
===General dimensions===
[[File:Nose_cone_general_dimensions.svg|alt=Two-dimensional drawing of an elliptical nose cone with dimensions added to show how L is the total length of the nose cone, R is the radius at the base, and y is the radius at a point x distance from the tip.|thumb|300x300px|General parameters used for constructing nose cone profiles.]]
In all of the following nose cone shape equations, {{mvar|L}} is the overall length of the nose cone and {{mvar|R}} is the radius of the base of the nose cone. {{mvar|y}} is the radius at any point {{mvar|x}}, as {{mvar|x}} varies from {{math|0}}, at the tip of the nose cone, to {{mvar|L}}. The equations define the two-dimensional profile of the nose shape. The full [[body of revolution]] of the nose cone is formed by rotating the profile around the centerline {{frac|{{mvar|C}}|{{mvar|L}}}}. While the equations describe the 'perfect' shape, practical nose cones are often blunted or truncated for manufacturing or aerodynamic reasons.

===Conic===
{{Multiple image

| image2 = Conic_Nose_Cone_Render.png

}}
A very common nose-cone shape is a simple [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. This shape is often chosen for its ease of manufacture. More optimal, streamlined shapes (described below) are often much more difficult to create. The sides of a conic profile are straight lines, so the diameter equation is simply:

: &lt;math&gt;y = {xR \over L}&lt;/math&gt;

Cones are sometimes defined by their half angle, {{math|&amp;phi;}}:

: &lt;math&gt;\phi = \arctan \left({R \over L}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = x \tan(\phi)\;&lt;/math&gt;

==== Spherically blunted conic  ====
{{Multiple image
| align = 
| direction = 
| width = 
| image1 = Spherically blunted cone geometry.svg
| caption1 = 
| image2 = Spherically_Blunted_Conic_Nose_Cone_Render.png
| caption2 = 
| footer_align = center
| footer = Spherically blunted conic nose cone render and profile with parameters shown.
| total_width = 500
}}
In practical applications, a conical nose is often blunted by capping it with a segment of a [[sphere]]. The tangency point where the sphere meets the cone can be found from:
: &lt;math&gt;x_t = \frac{L^2}{R} \sqrt{ \frac{r_n^2}{R^2 + L^2} }&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y_t = \frac{x_t R}{L}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|r&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the radius of the spherical nose cap.

The center of the spherical nose cap, {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;}}, can be found from:
: &lt;math&gt;x_o = x_t + \sqrt{ r_n^2 - y_t^2} &lt;/math&gt;

And the apex point, {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be found from: 
: &lt;math&gt;x_a = x_o - r_n&lt;/math&gt;

===Bi-conic===
{{Multiple image
| align = 
| direction = 
| width = 
| image1 = nose cone bi-conic.png
| caption1 = 
| image2 = Bi-Conic Nose Cone Render.png
| caption2 = 
| footer_align = center
| footer = Bi-conic nose cone render and profile with parameters shown.
| total_width = 500
}}
A bi-conic nose cone shape is simply a cone with length {{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} stacked on top of a [[frustum]] of a cone (commonly known as a ''conical transition section'' shape) with length {{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where the base of the upper cone is equal in radius {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} to the top radius of the smaller frustum with base radius {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

:&lt;math&gt;L=L_1+L_2&lt;/math&gt;
:For &lt;math&gt;0 \le x \le L_1 &lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;y = {xR_1 \over L_1}&lt;/math&gt;
:For &lt;math&gt;L_1 \le x \le L&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;y = R_1 + {(x - L_1)(R_2-R_1)\over L_2}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Half angles:'''

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_1 = \arctan \left({R_1 \over L_1}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = x \tan(\phi_1)\;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_2 = \arctan \left({R_2 - R_1 \over L_2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = R_1 + (x - L_1) \tan(\phi_2)\;&lt;/math&gt;

===Tangent ogive===
{{Multiple image
| align = 
| direction = 
| width = 
| image1 = Nose_cone_tangent_ogive.png
| caption1 = 
| image2 = Tangent Ogive Nose Cone Render.png
| width2 = 
| caption2 = 
| footer_align = center
| footer = Tangent ogive nose cone render and profile with parameters and ogive circle shown.
| total_width = 500
}}
Next to a simple cone, the tangent [[ogive]] shape is the most familiar in [[model rocketry|hobby rocketry]]. The profile of this shape is formed by a segment of a [[circle]] such that the rocket body is [[tangent]] to the curve of the nose cone at its base, and the base is on the radius of the circle. The popularity of this shape is largely due to the ease of constructing its profile, as it is simply a circular section.

The radius of the circle that forms the ogive is called the ''ogive radius'', {{mvar|&amp;rho;}}, and it is related to the length and base radius of the nose cone as expressed by the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = {R^2 + L^2\over 2R}&lt;/math&gt;
The radius {{mvar|y}} at any point {{mvar|x}}, as {{mvar|x}} varies from {{math|0}} to {{mvar|L}} is:
:&lt;math&gt;y = \sqrt{\rho^2 - (L - x)^2}+R - \rho&lt;/math&gt;

The nose cone length, {{mvar|L}}, must be less than or equal to {{mvar|&amp;rho;}}. If they are equal, then the shape is a [[Sphere|hemisphere]].

==== Spherically blunted tangent ogive ====
{{Multiple image
| align = 
| direction = 
| width = 
| image1 = Spherically blunted tangent ogive geometry.svg
| caption1 = 
| image2 = Spherically_Blunted_Tangent_Ogive_Nose_Cone_Render.png
| caption2 = 
| footer_align = center
| footer = Spherically blunted tangent ogive nose cone render and profile with parameters shown.
| total_width = 500
}}
A tangent ogive nose is often blunted by capping it with a segment of a [[sphere]].  The tangency point where the sphere meets the tangent ogive can be found from:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  x_o &amp;= L - \sqrt{\left(\rho - r_n\right)^2 - (\rho - R)^2} \\
  y_t &amp;= \frac{r_n(\rho - R)}{\rho - r_n} \\
  x_t &amp;= x_o - \sqrt{r_n^2 - y_t^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|r&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the radius and {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the center of the spherical nose cap.

Finally, the apex point can be found from:
: &lt;math&gt;x_a = x_o - r_n&lt;/math&gt;

===Secant ogive===
{{Multiple image
| align = 
| direction = 
| width = 
| image1 = nose cone secant ogive 1.png
| caption1 = 
| image2 = Secant_Ogive_Nose_Cone_Render.png
| caption2 = 
| footer_align = center
| footer = Secant ogive nose cone render and profile with parameters and ogive circle shown.
| total_width = 500
}}
The profile of this shape is also formed by a segment of a circle, but the base of the shape is not on the radius of the circle defined by the ogive radius. The rocket body will '''not''' be tangent to the curve of the nose at its base. The ogive radius {{mvar|&amp;rho;}} is not determined by {{mvar|R}} and {{mvar|L}} (as it is for a tangent ogive), but rather is one of the factors to be chosen to define the nose shape. If the chosen ogive radius of a secant ogive is greater than the ogive radius of a tangent ogive with the same {{mvar|R}} and {{mvar|L}}, then the resulting secant ogive appears as a tangent ogive with a portion of the base truncated.

:&lt;math&gt;\rho &gt; {R^2 + L^2 \over 2R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \arctan \left({R \over L}\right) - \arccos \left({\sqrt{L^2 + R^2} \over 2\rho}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Then the radius {{mvar|y}} at any point {{mvar|x}} as {{mvar|x}} varies from {{math|0}} to {{mvar|L}} is:
:&lt;math&gt;y = \sqrt{\rho^2 - (\rho\cos(\alpha) - x)^2} + \rho\sin(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;
{{Multiple image
| align = 
| direction = 
| width = 
| image1 = nose cone secant ogive 2.png
| caption1 = 
| image2 = Secant_Ogive_Nose_Cone_(Bulge)_Render.png
| caption2 = 
| footer_align = center
| footer = Alternate secant ogive render and profile which show a bulge due to a smaller radius.
| total_width = 500
}}
If the chosen {{mvar|&amp;rho;}} is less than the tangent ogive {{mvar|&amp;rho;}} and greater than half the length of the nose cone, then the result will be a secant ogive that bulges out to a maximum diameter that is greater than the base diameter. The classic example of this shape is the nose cone of the [[MGR-1 Honest John|Honest John]].
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{2} &lt; \rho &lt; {R^2 + L^2 \over 2R}&lt;/math&gt;

===Elliptical===
{{Multiple image
| align = 
| direction = 
| width = 
| image1 = nose cone elliptical.svg
| caption1 = 
| image2 = Elliptical_Nose_Cone_Render.png
| caption2 = 
| footer_align = center
| footer = Elliptical nose cone render and profile with parameters shown.
| total_width = 500
}}
The profile of this shape is one-half of an [[ellipse]], with the major axis being the centerline and the minor axis being the base of the nose cone. A rotation of a full ellipse about its major axis is called a [[prolate]] spheroid, so an elliptical nose shape would properly be known as a prolate hemispheroid. This shape is popular in subsonic flight (such as [[model rocketry]]) due to the blunt nose and tangent base.{{elucidate|date=June 2014}} This is not a shape normally found in professional rocketry, which almost always flies at much higher velocities where other designs are more suitable. If {{mvar|R}} equals {{mvar|L}}, this is a [[Sphere|hemisphere]].

:&lt;math&gt;y = R \sqrt{1 - {x^2 \over L^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Parabolic===
{{Multiple image

| direction =

| image1 = Parabolic (Half) Nose Cone Render.png
| caption1 = Half ({{Math|''K''′ {{=}} 1/2}})

| caption3 = Full ({{Math|''K''′ {{=}} 1}})
| footer_align = center
| footer = Renders of common parabolic nose cone shapes.

}}
This nose shape is not the blunt shape that is envisioned when people commonly refer to a "parabolic" nose cone. The parabolic series nose shape is generated by rotating a segment of a [[parabola]] around a line parallel to its [[latus rectum]]. This construction is similar to that of the tangent ogive, except that a parabola is the defining shape rather than a circle. Just as it does on an ogive, this construction produces a nose shape with a sharp tip. For the blunt shape typically associated with a parabolic nose, see [[Nose_cone_design#Power_series|power series]] below. (The parabolic shape is also often confused with the elliptical shape.)

For &lt;math&gt;0 \le K' \le 1&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;y = R\left({2 \left({x \over L}\right) - K'\left({x \over L}\right)^2 \over 2 - K'}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

{{math|''K''′}} can vary anywhere between {{math|0}} and {{math|1}}, but the most common values used for nose cone shapes are:
{| class="wikitable"
!Parabola Type
!{{math|''K''′}} Value 
|-
|Cone
|{{Math|0}}
|-
|Half
|{{Math|1/2}}
|-
|Three Quarter
|{{Math|3/4}}
|-
|Full
|{{Math|1}}
|}
For the case of the full parabola ({{math|''K''′ {{=}} 1}}) the shape is [[tangent]] to the body at its base, and the base is on the axis of the parabola. Values of {{math|''K''′}} less than {{Math|1}} result in a slimmer shape, whose appearance is similar to that of the secant ogive. The shape is no longer tangent at the base, and the base is parallel to, but offset from, the axis of the parabola.

===Power series===
[[File:Nose Cone Power Series.svg|thumb|Graphs illustrating power series nose cone shapes|alt=|350x350px]]
{{Multiple image

}}
The ''power series'' includes the shape commonly referred to as a 'parabolic' nose cone, but the shape correctly known as a parabolic nose cone is a member of the parabolic series (described above). The power series shape is characterized by its (usually) blunt tip, and by the fact that its base is not tangent to the body tube. There is always a discontinuity at the joint between  nose cone and body that looks distinctly non-aerodynamic. The shape can be modified at the base to smooth out this discontinuity. Both a flat-faced [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] and a [[cone (geometry)|cone]] are shapes that are members of the power series.

The power series nose shape is generated by rotating the {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''R''(''x''/''L'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} curve about the {{mvar|x}}-axis for values of {{mvar|n}} less than {{math|1}}. The factor {{mvar|n}} controls the bluntness of the shape. For values of {{mvar|n}} above about {{math|0.7}}, the tip is fairly sharp. As {{mvar|n}} decreases towards zero, the power series nose shape becomes increasingly blunt.

:For  &lt;math&gt;0 \le n \le 1&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;y = R\left({x \over L}\right)^n&lt;/math&gt;

Common values of {{mvar|n}} include:

===Haack series===

Unlike all of the nose cone shapes above, the [[Wolfgang Haack|Haack]] series shapes are not constructed from geometric figures. The shapes are instead mathematically derived for the purpose of minimizing [[Drag (physics)|drag]]; see also [[Sears–Haack body]]. While the series is a continuous set of shapes determined by the value of {{mvar|C}} in the equations below, two values of {{mvar|C}} have particular significance: when {{math|''C'' {{=}} 0}}, the notation {{mvar|LD}} signifies minimum drag for the given length and diameter, and when {{math|''C'' {{=}} 1/3}}, {{mvar|LV}} indicates minimum drag for a given length and volume. The Haack series nose cones are not perfectly tangent to the body at their base except for the case where {{math|''C'' {{=}} 2/3}}. However, the discontinuity is usually so slight as to be imperceptible. For {{math|''C'' &gt; 2/3}}, Haack nose cones bulge to a maximum diameter greater than the base diameter. Haack nose tips do not come to a sharp point, but are slightly rounded.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \theta &amp;= \arccos \left(1 - {2x \over L}\right) \\
       y &amp;= {R \over \sqrt{\pi}} \sqrt{\theta - {\sin(2\theta)\over 2} + C \sin^3 (\theta)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Special values of {{mvar|C}} (as described above) include:
{| class="wikitable"
!Haack Series Type
!{{mvar|C}} Value 
|-
|LV-Haack
|{{Math|1/3}}
|-
|LD-Haack (Von Kármán)
|{{Math|0}}
|-
|Tangent
|{{Math|2/3}}
|}

===Von Kármán===
The [[#Haack series|Haack series]] giving minimum drag for the given length and diameter, the LD-Haack where {{math|''C'' {{=}} 0}}, is commonly called the [[Theodore von Kármán|''Von Kármán'']] or ''Von Kármán [[ogive]]''.

===Aerospike===
{{main|Drag-reducing aerospike}}

==Nose cone drag characteristics==

For aircraft and rockets, below [[Mach number|Mach]] .8, the nose pressure drag is essentially zero for all shapes. The major significant factor is friction drag, which is largely dependent upon the [[wetted area]], the surface smoothness of that area, and the presence of any discontinuities in the shape. For example, in strictly subsonic rockets a short, blunt, smooth elliptical shape is usually best. In the [[transonic]] region and beyond, where the pressure drag increases dramatically, the effect of nose shape on drag becomes highly significant. The factors influencing the pressure drag are the general shape of the nose cone, its [[fineness ratio]], and its bluffness ratio.

===Influence of the general shape===

Many references on nose cone design contain empirical data comparing the drag characteristics of various nose shapes in different flight regimes. The chart shown here seems to be the most comprehensive and useful compilation of data for the flight regime of greatest interest.{{attribution needed|date=January 2012}} This chart generally agrees with more detailed, but less comprehensive data found in other references (most notably the [[Missile Datcom|USAF Datcom]]).

[[Image:Nose cone drag comparison.png|Comparison of drag characteristics of various nose cone shapes in the [[transonic]] to low-mach regions. Rankings are: superior (1), good (2), fair (3), inferior (4).|alt=|center|thumb|504x504px]]

In many nose cone designs, the greatest concern is flight performance in the transonic region from 0.8 to 1.2 Mach. Although data are not available for many shapes in the transonic region, the table clearly suggests that either the Von Kármán shape, or power series shape with {{Math|n {{=}} 1/2}}, would be preferable to the popular conical or ogive shapes, for this purpose.

[[File:F-16_June_2008.jpg|thumb|right|alt=General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]]

This observation goes against the often-repeated conventional wisdom that a conical nose is optimum for 'Mach-breaking'. Fighter aircraft are probably good examples of nose shapes optimized for the transonic region, although their nose shapes are often distorted by other considerations of avionics and inlets. For example, an [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]] nose appears to be a very close match to a Von Kármán shape.

===Influence of the fineness ratio===
The ratio of the length of a nose cone compared to its base diameter is known as the ''[[fineness ratio]]''. This is sometimes also called the ''aspect ratio'', though that term is usually applied to wings and fins. Fineness ratio is often applied to the entire vehicle, considering the overall length and diameter. The length/diameter relation is also often called the ''caliber'' of a nose cone.

At supersonic speeds, the fineness ratio has a significant effect on nose cone [[wave drag]], particularly at low ratios; but there is very little additional gain for ratios increasing beyond 5:1. As the fineness ratio increases, the wetted area, and thus the skin friction component of drag, is also going to increase. Therefore, the minimum drag fineness ratio is ultimately going to be a trade-off between the decreasing wave drag and increasing friction drag.

An '''octane rating''', or '''octane number''', is a standard measure of the performance of an engine or aviation fuel. The higher the octane number, the more [[Compression ratio|compression]] the fuel can withstand before detonating (igniting). In broad terms, fuels with a higher octane rating are used in high performance [[Petrol engine|gasoline engine]]s that require higher [[compression ratio]]s. In contrast, fuels with lower octane numbers (but higher [[cetane number]]s) are ideal for [[diesel engine]]s, because diesel engines (also referred to as compression-ignition engines) do not compress the fuel, but rather compress only air and then inject fuel into the air which was heated by compression. Gasoline engines rely on ignition of [[Air-fuel mixture|air and fuel]] compressed together as a mixture, which is ignited at the end of the compression [[stroke (engine)|stroke]] using [[spark plug]]s. Therefore, high compressibility of the fuel matters mainly for gasoline engines. Use of [[gasoline]] with lower octane numbers may lead to the problem of [[engine knocking]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Werner Dabelstein, Arno Reglitzky, Andrea Schütze and Klaus Reders "Automotive Fuels" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2007, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.{{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a16_719.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
===The problem: pre-ignition and knocking===
{{main|Engine knocking}}
In a normal spark-ignition engine, the air-fuel mixture is heated because of being compressed and is then triggered to burn rapidly by the spark plug. During the combustion process, if the unburnt portion of the fuel in the combustion chamber is heated (or compressed) too much, pockets of unburnt fuel may self-ignite (detonate) before the main flame front reaches them. Shockwaves produced by detonation can cause much higher pressures than engine components are designed for, and can cause a "knocking" or "pinging" sound. Knocking can cause major engine damage if severe.

The most typically used engine management systems found in automobiles today have a [[knock sensor]] that monitors if knock is being produced by the fuel being used. In modern computer-controlled engines, the [[ignition timing]] will be automatically altered by the engine management system to reduce the knock to an acceptable level.

===Isooctane as a reference standard===
[[Image:OctaneStds.png|thumb|left|320px|[[2,2,4-Trimethylpentane]] (iso-octane) (upper) has an octane rating of 100 whereas [[n-heptane]] has an octane rating of 0.]]
[[Octane]]s are a family of hydrocarbons that are typical components of gasoline. They are colorless liquids that boil around 125&amp;nbsp;°C (260&amp;nbsp;°F). One member of the octane family, isooctane, is used as a reference standard to benchmark the tendency of [[gasoline]] or [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] fuels to resist self-ignition.

The octane rating of [[gasoline]] is measured in a test engine and is defined by comparison with the mixture of [[2,2,4-trimethylpentane]] (iso-octane) and [[heptane]] that would have the same anti-knocking capacity as the fuel under test: the percentage, by volume, of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane in that mixture is the octane number of the fuel.  For example, gasoline with the same knocking characteristics as a mixture of 90% iso-octane and 10% heptane would have an octane rating of 90.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kemp, Kenneth W. |author2=Brown, Theodore |author3=Nelson, John D. |title=Chemistry: the central science |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J |year=2003 |page=992 |isbn=0-13-066997-0 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A rating of 90 does not mean that the gasoline contains just iso-octane and heptane in these proportions but that it has the same detonation resistance properties (generally, gasoline sold for common use never consists solely of iso-octane and heptane; it is a mixture of many hydrocarbons and often other additives). Because some fuels are more knock-resistant than pure iso-octane, the definition has been extended to allow for octane numbers greater than 100.

Octane ratings are not indicators of the energy content of fuels. (See [[Octane rating#Effects|Effects]] below and [[Heat of combustion]]). They are only a measure of the fuel's tendency to burn in a controlled manner, rather than exploding in an uncontrolled manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ygVsCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT853&amp;dq=Octane+ratings+are+not+indicators+of+the+energy+content+of+fuels.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD4deanPbXAhVE12MKHWxjA9gQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Octane%20ratings%20are%20not%20indicators%20of%20the%20energy%20content%20of%20fuels.&amp;f=false|title=Chemistry for the IB Diploma Second Edition|last=Harwood|first=Richard|last2=Coates|first2=Christopher|last3=Talbot|first3=Christopher|date=2015-07-31|publisher=Hodder Education|isbn=9781471829222|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the octane number is raised by blending in ethanol, energy content per volume is reduced. Ethanol [[British thermal unit|BTU]]s can be compared with gasoline BTUs in heat of combustion tables.

It is possible for a fuel to have a Research Octane Number (RON) more than 100, because iso-octane is not the most knock-resistant substance available.  Racing fuels, [[avgas]], LPG and [[alcohol fuel]]s such as [[methanol]] may have octane ratings of 110 or significantly higher. Typical "octane booster" [[gasoline additive]]s include [[MTBE]], [[ETBE]], [[isooctane]] and [[toluene]]. [[Lead]] in the form of [[tetraethyllead]] was once a common additive, but its use for fuels for road vehicles has been progressively phased-out worldwide, beginning in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/R10/airpage.nsf/webpage/Leaded+Gas+Phaseout|title=Leaded Gas Phaseout|date=June 1995|publisher=U.S. EPA, Region 10|id=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603152013/http://yosemite.epa.gov/R10/airpage.nsf/webpage/Leaded%2BGas%2BPhaseout|archivedate=2008-06-03|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2012-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement methods==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Avgas]] --&gt;

[[Image:Gas Station Pump Five Octane Ratings.jpg|thumb|280px|right|A US gas station pump offering five different (R+M)/2 octane ratings]]

===Research Octane Number (RON){{anchor|RON}}===
The most common type of octane rating worldwide is the '''Research Octane Number''' ('''RON''').  RON is determined by running the fuel in a test [[engine]] with a variable [[compression ratio]] under controlled conditions, and comparing the results with those for mixtures of iso-octane and n-heptane.

===Motor Octane Number (MON){{anchor|MON}}===
Another type of octane rating, called '''Motor Octane Number''' ('''MON'''), is determined at 900 rpm engine speed instead of the 600 rpm for RON.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;  MON testing uses a similar test engine to that used in RON testing, but with a preheated fuel mixture, higher engine speed, and variable [[ignition system|ignition timing]] to further stress the fuel's knock resistance.  Depending on the composition of the fuel, the MON of a modern pump gasoline will be about 8 to 12 octane lower than the RON, but there is no direct link between RON and MON.  Pump gasoline specifications typically require both a minimum RON and a minimum MON.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

===Anti-Knock Index (AKI) or (R+M)/2{{anchor|AKI}}===
In most countries in Europe (also in Australia and New Zealand) the "headline" octane rating shown on the pump is the RON, but in Canada, the United States, Brazil, and some other countries, the headline number is the average of the RON and the MON, called the '''Anti-Knock Index''' ('''AKI'''), and often written on pumps as '''(R+M)/2'''.  It may also sometimes be called the '''Posted Octane Number''' ('''PON''').

===Difference between RON, MON, and AKI{{anchor|Sensitivity}}===
Because of the 8 to 12 octane number difference between RON and MON noted above, the AKI shown in Canada and the United States is 4 to 6 octane numbers lower than elsewhere in the world for the same fuel.  This difference between RON and MON is known as the fuel's Sensitivity,&lt;ref name="vintagebonanza.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagebonanza.com/octane.htm|title=Octane determination in Piston Engines|work=vintagebonanza.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190552/http://www.vintagebonanza.com/octane.htm|archivedate=2013-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is not typically published for those countries that use the Anti-Knock Index labelling system.

See the table in the following section for a comparison.

===Observed Road Octane Number (RdON)===
Another type of octane rating, called '''Observed Road Octane Number''' ('''RdON'''), is derived from testing gasolines in real world multi-cylinder engines, normally at wide open throttle. It was developed in the 1920s and is still reliable today. The original testing was done in cars on the road but as technology developed the testing was moved to chassis dynamometers with environmental controls to improve consistency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.runyard.org/jr/CFR/OctaneExplanation.htm|title=Octane Explanation|work=runyard.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727224512/http://www.runyard.org/jr/CFR/OctaneExplanation.htm|archivedate=2011-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Octane Index===
The evaluation of the octane number by the two laboratory methods requires a standard engine, and the test procedure can be both expensive and time-consuming.  The standard engine required for the test may not always be available, especially in out-of-the-way places or in small or mobile laboratories. These and other considerations led to the search for a rapid method for the evaluation of the anti-knock quality of gasoline. Such methods include FTIR, near infrared on-line analyzers (ASTM D-2885) and others. Deriving an equation that can be used for calculating the octane quality would also serve the same purpose with added advantages. The term Octane Index is often used to refer to the calculated octane quality in contradistinction to the (measured) research or motor octane numbers. The octane index can be of great service in the blending of gasoline. Motor gasoline, as marketed, is usually a blend of several types of refinery grades that are derived from different processes such as straight-run gasoline, reformate, cracked gasoline etc. These different grades are considered as one group when blending to meet final product specifications. Most refiners produce and market more than one grade of motor gasoline, differing principally in their anti-knock quality. The ability to predict the octane quality of the blends prior to blending is essential, something for which the calculated octane index is specially suited.&lt;ref&gt;H. Al-Haj Ibrahim and M. Al-Kassmi, Determination of calculated octane index for motor gasoline, The Arabian Journal for science and engineering, vol. 25, No. 2B, Oct. 2000, pp. 179-186.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aviation gasoline octane ratings===
[[Aviation gasoline]]s used in piston aircraft engines common in general aviation have a slightly different method of measuring the octane of the fuel.  Similar to an AKI, it has two different ratings, although it is referred to only by the lower of the two. One is referred to as the "aviation lean" rating and is the same as the MON of the fuel up to 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.txideafarm.com/unpublished_blend_paper.pdf |title=Replacing Leaded Aviation Gasoline |website=Txideafarm.com |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304211600/http://www.txideafarm.com/unpublished_blend_paper.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second is the "aviation rich" rating and corresponds to the octane rating of a test engine under forced induction operation common in high-performance and military piston aircraft.  This utilizes a supercharger, and uses a significantly richer fuel/air ratio for improved detonation resistance.&lt;ref name="vintagebonanza.com"/&gt; {{unreliable source?|date=April 2018}}

The most commonly used current fuel, [[100LL]], has an aviation lean rating of 100 octane, and an aviation rich rating of 130.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aviation-fuel.com/pdfs/avgas100llspecsastmd910_2011.pdf |format=PDF |title=Standard Specification for Aviation Gasolines |website=Aviation-fuel.com |accessdate=2017-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415123705/http://www.aviation-fuel.com/pdfs/avgas100llspecsastmd910_2011.pdf |archivedate=2016-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The RON/MON values of n-[[heptane]] and iso-octane are exactly 0 and 100, respectively, by the definition of octane rating. The following table lists octane ratings for various other fuels.&lt;ref name="Purdue Coal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/1organic/coal.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425075157/http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/1organic/coal.html |archivedate=2009-04-25 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IUPAC"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1983/pdf/5502x0199.pdf |first=Alexandru T. |last=Balaban |title=Topological Indices based on Topological Distances in Molecular Graphs |journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry |volume=55 |pages=199–206 |year=1983 |publisher=IUPAC |format=PDF |doi=10.1351/pac198855020199 |issue=2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830045002/https://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1983/pdf/5502x0199.pdf |archivedate=2017-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
{{Uncited-section|date=September 2018}}
Higher octane ratings correlate to higher [[activation energy|activation energies]]: the amount of applied energy required to initiate combustion.  Since higher octane fuels have higher activation energy requirements, it is less likely that a given compression will cause uncontrolled ignition, otherwise known as autoignition or detonation.

Because octane is a measured and/or calculated rating of the fuel's ability to resist autoignition, the higher the octane of the fuel, the harder that fuel is to ignite and the more heat is required to ignite it. The result is that a hotter ignition spark is required for ignition. Creating a hotter spark requires more energy from the ignition system, which in turn increases the parasitic electrical load on the engine. The spark also must begin earlier in order to generate sufficient heat at the proper time for precise ignition. As octane, ignition spark energy, and the need for precise timing increase, the engine becomes more difficult to "tune" and keep "in tune". The resulting sub-optimal spark energy and timing can cause major engine problems, from a simple "miss" to uncontrolled detonation and catastrophic engine failure.

The other rarely-discussed reality with high-octane fuels associated with "high performance" is that as octane increases, the [[specific gravity]] and energy content of the fuel per unit of weight are reduced. The net result is that to make a given amount of [[Power (physics)|power]], more high-octane fuel must be burned in the engine. Lighter and "thinner" fuel also has a lower [[Heat Capacity|specific heat]], so the practice of running an engine "rich" to use excess fuel to aid in cooling requires richer and richer mixtures as octane increases.

Higher-octane, lower-energy-dense "thinner" fuels often contain [[alcohol]] compounds incompatible with the stock fuel system components, which also makes them [[hygroscopic]]. They also evaporate away much more easily than heavier, lower-octane fuel which leads to more accumulated contaminants in the fuel system. Its typically the {{Citation needed span|text=hydrochloric acids that form due to that water|date=September 2018|reason=HCl can't form from plain water unless chlorine atoms are somehow involved (petrol has almost no Cl so where do these come from?)}} and the compounds in the fuel that have the most detrimental effects on the engine fuel system components, as such acids corrode many metals used in gasoline fuel systems. 

During the compression stroke of an internal combustion engine, the temperature of the air-fuel mix rises as it is compressed, in accordance with the [[ideal gas law]]. Higher compression ratios necessarily add parasitic load to the engine, and are only necessary if the engine is being specifically designed to run on high-octane fuel. Aircraft engines run at relatively low speeds and are "[[undersquare]]". They run best on lower-octane, slower-burning fuels that require less heat and a lower compression ratio for optimum vaporization and uniform fuel-air mixing, with the ignition spark coming as late as possible in order to extend the production of cylinder pressure and torque as far down the power stroke as possible. The main reason for using high-octane fuel in air-cooled engines is that it is more easily vaporized in a cold carburetor and engine and absorbs less intake air heat which greatly reduces the tendency for [[carburetor icing]] to occur. 

With their reduced densities and weight per volume of fuel, the other obvious benefit is that an aircraft with any given volume of fuel in the tanks is automatically lighter. And since many airplanes are flown only occasionally and may sit unused for weeks or months, the lighter fuels tend to evaporate away and leave behind fewer deposits such as "varnish". Aircraft also typically have dual "redundant" ignition systems which are nearly impossible to tune and time to produce identical ignition timing so using a lighter fuel that's less prone to autoignition is a wise "insurance policy". For the same reasons, those lighter fuels which are better solvents are much less likely to cause any "varnish" or other fouling on the "backup" spark plugs. 

Because of the high cost of unleaded, high-octane [[avgas]], and the tendency of piston-engine aircraft to be recreational vehicles and the potential for fuel loss via evaporation/theft/leaks, most general aviation pilots attempt to save money by tuning their fuel-air mixtures and ignition timing to run "lean of peak". 

That practice can be fine for "cruising" straight and level and in smooth air, but in case of the need to rapidly add power (sudden climb, headwind, etc), the additional "insurance policy" of excess octane in avgas helps prevent dangerously lean fuel-air mixtures from rapidly melting and physically "burning" the aluminum pistons in an air-cooled aircraft engine. With only fuel, lubricating oil and airflow to cool the engine and a "lean of peak" mixture with no "excess" fuel for cooling, the engine is only a few seconds of dangerously lean mixtures, autoignition and detonation away from catastrophic failure.

==Regional variations==
The selection of octane ratings available at the pump can vary greatly from region to region.

*Australia: "regular" [[unleaded]] fuel is 91&amp;nbsp;RON, "premium" unleaded with 95&amp;nbsp;RON is widely available, and 98&amp;nbsp;RON fuel is also reasonably common. Shell used to sell 100&amp;nbsp;RON fuel (5% ethanol content) from a small number of service stations, most of which are located in major cities (stopped in August 2008). United Petroleum used to sell 100 RON unleaded fuel (10% ethanol content) at a small number of its service stations (originally only two, but then expanded to 67 outlets nationwide) (stopped in September 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitedpetroleum.com.au/index.asp?pgID=65 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830065746/http://www.unitedpetroleum.com.au/index.asp?pgID=65 |archivedate=2010-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitedpetroleum.com.au/distributor-premium100-locations.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902062128/http://www.unitedpetroleum.com.au/distributor-premium100-locations.asp |archivedate=2010-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All fuel in Australia is unleaded except for some aviation fuels. E85 unleaded fuel is also available at several United service stations across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitedpetroleum.com.au/united/fuel/ethanol-85 |title=Ethanol 85 |website=Unitedpetroleum.com.au |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223102114/http://www.unitedpetroleum.com.au/united/fuel/ethanol-85 |archivedate=2016-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently E10 fuel has become quite common {{cn|date=October 2017}}, and is available at almost every major fuel station. The Australian government makes stations advertise E10 as 94 RON. {{cn|date=October 2017}}
*Bahrain: 91 and 95 (RON), standard in all gasoline stations in the country and advertised as (Jayyid) for Regular or 91 and (Mumtaz) for Premium or 95 and 98 (RON) as super.
*Bangladesh: Two types of fuel are available at petrol stations in Bangladesh. Motor Gasoline Regular (marketed as "Petrol") which has RON 80 rating, and Motor Gasoline Premium (marketed as "Octane") which has RON 95 rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pocl.gov.bd/?page_id=951|title=Product Specification - Petroleum|last=|first=|date=|work=Padma Oil Company Limited|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petrol stations in Bangladesh are privatised, but the prices are regulated by the authorities and have a fixed price at BDT 86.00 (USD 1.04) and BDT 89.00 (USD 1.07) (as of 1 March, 2018) per litre respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bpc.gov.bd/contactus.php?id=39|title=Petroleum Local Price|last=|date=|website=www.bpc.gov.bd|language=en|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*China: 92 and 95 (RON) (previously 93 and 97&lt;ref name="icct-cn-5"&gt;{{cite web|title=China V gasoline and diesel fuel quality standards|url=http://www.theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/ICCTupdate_ChinaVfuelquality_jan2014.pdf|publisher=International Council on Clean Transportation|format=PDF|accessdate=7 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927064315/http://www.theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/ICCTupdate_ChinaVfuelquality_jan2014.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are commonly offered. In limited areas higher rating such as 98 RON is available. In some rural areas it can be difficult to find fuel with over 92 RON.
*Chile: 93, 95 and 97 RON are standard at almost all gas stations thorough Chile. The three types are unleaded.
*Colombia: "Ecopetrol", Colombia's monopoly of refining and distribution of gasoline establishes a minimum AKI of 81 octanes for "Corriente" gasoline&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and minimum AKI of 87 octanes for "Extra" gasoline.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; (91.5 RON corriente,&lt;ref name="ecopetrol.com.co"/&gt; and 91 RON for extra&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;)
*Costa Rica: RECOPE, Costa Rica's distribution monopoly, establishes the following ratings: Plus 91 (at least 91 RON) and Super (at least 95 RON).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.recope.go.cr/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Manual_Productos.pdf |format=PDF |title=Manual de Productis |date=2011 |website=Recope.go.cr |accessdate=2017-01-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107010050/https://www.recope.go.cr/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Manual_Productos.pdf |archivedate=2017-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Croatia: All fuel stations offer unleaded "Eurosuper BS" (abbreviation "BS" meaning "no sulfur content") 95 RON fuel, many also offer "Eurosuper Plus BS" 98 RON.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ina.hr/default.aspx?id=204|title=INA d.d.|work=ina.hr|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222140334/http://www.ina.hr/default.aspx?id=204|archivedate=2014-02-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lukoil.hr|title=Lukoil Hrvatska|work=lukoil.hr|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218080333/http://www.lukoil.hr/|archivedate=2014-02-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies offer 100 RON fuel instead of 98.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crodux-derivati.hr/cijene-goriva/|title=Crodux derivati|work=crodux-derivati.hr|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221074851/http://crodux-derivati.hr/cijene-goriva/|archivedate=2014-02-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cyprus: All fuel stations offer unleaded 95 and 98 RON and a few offer 100 RON as well.
*Denmark: 95 RON is a common choice, with 92 and 95 being widely available. However several fuel stations are phasing out 92 RON. By law, it is decided that all gasoline companies from July 2010 should use a mix containing 5% bioethanol in the gasoline.
*Ecuador: "Extra" with 87 and "Super" with 92 (RON) are available in all fuel stations. "Extra" is the most commonly used. All fuels are unleaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arch.gob.ec/index.php/descargas/leyes-y-reglamentos/doc_download/292-norma-inen-935-2012.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070707/http://www.arch.gob.ec/index.php/descargas/leyes-y-reglamentos/doc_download/292-norma-inen-935-2012.html |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Egypt: Egyptian Fuel Stations had 90 RON until July 2014 when the Government found no remaining use for it, leaving only 92 RON and 95 RON. 80 RON is found in a very limited amount of fuel stations as they are used only for extremely old cars that cannot cope with high octane fuel. 95 RON was used limitedly due to its high price (more than twice the price of 92 RON).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/arabic/middleeast/2014/07/140704_egypt_fuel_prices|title=الحكومة المصرية ترفع أسعار الوقود بنسبة تقترب من الضعف|work=BBC Arabic|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201103611/http://www.bbc.co.uk/arabic/middleeast/2014/07/140704_egypt_fuel_prices|archivedate=2014-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But after the increasing the prices again in 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.skynewsarabia.com/business/1056999-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B3%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%82%D9%88%D8%AF|title=الحكومة المصرية ترفع أسعار الوقود|work=Sky News Arabic&lt;/ref&gt;, 95 RON price became only 15% higher than 92 RON, so it started to gain popularity. 
*Estonia: 95 RON and 98 RON are widely available.
*Finland: 95 and 98 (RON), advertised as such, at almost all gas stations. Most cars run on 95, but 98 is available for vehicles that need higher octane fuel, or older models containing parts easily damaged by high ethanol content. Shell offers V-Power, advertised as "over 99 octane", instead of 98. In the beginning of 2011 95&amp;nbsp;RON was replaced by 95E10 containing 10% ethanol, and 98&amp;nbsp;RON by 98E5, containing 5% ethanol. ST1 also offers RE85 on some stations, which is 85% ethanol made from [[biodegradable waste]] (from which the advertised name "ReFuel" comes). RE85 is only suitable for [[flexifuel]] cars that can run on high-percentage ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vtt.fi/news/2009/03312009b.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308020531/http://www.vtt.fi/news/2009/03312009b.jsp |archivedate=2012-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Germany: "Super E10" 95&amp;nbsp;RON and "Super Plus E5" 98&amp;nbsp;RON are available practically everywhere. Big suppliers such as [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] or [[Aral AG|Aral]] offer 100&amp;nbsp;RON gasoline ([[Shell V-Power]], Aral Ultimate) at almost every fuel station. "Normal" 91&amp;nbsp;RON is only rarely offered because lower production amounts make it more expensive than "Super" 95&amp;nbsp;RON. Due to a new European Union law, gas stations are being required to offer a minimum rate of the new mixture of "Super" 95 RON with up to 10% Ethanol branded as "Super E10".{{Citation needed|reason=this needs a reliable source or reference to the law.

*Greece (Hellas): 95 RON (standard unleaded), 97+ &amp; 100 RON unleaded offered by some companies (e.g. EKO, Shell, BP). Also available Super LRP 96 RON for older (non-catalytic) vehicles.
*Hong Kong: only 98&amp;nbsp;RON is available in the market. There have been calls to re-introduce 95&amp;nbsp;RON, but the calls have been rejected by all automotive fuel station chains, citing that 95&amp;nbsp;RON was phased out because of market forces.
*India: India's ordinary and premium petrol options are of 91 RON. The premium petrols are generally ordinary fuels with additives, that do not really change the octane value. Two variants, "Speed 93" and "Speed 97", were launched, with RON values of 93 and 97. Recently, Hindustan Petroleum launched poWer 99 with an RON value of 99 which is currently available only in Bangalore, Pune and now in Mumbai but expected to roll out in other major cities soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.team-bhp.com/news/hindustan-petroleum-launches-99-octane-fuel-high-end-cars|title=Hindustan Petroleum Launches High Performance 99 Octane Fuel - NDTV CarAndBike|last=|first=|date=|work=CarAndBike|access-date=2018-04-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's economy-class vehicles usually have compression ratios under 10:1, thus enabling them to use lower-octane petrol without engine knocking.
*Indonesia: Indonesia's "Premium" gasoline rated at 88 RON. Other options are "Pertalite", rated at 90 RON, "Pertamax", rated at 92 RON and the "Pertamax Plus" rated at 95 RON, and "Pertamax Racing", a 100 RON fuel sold in few stations. Starting from August 2016 Pertamina has started selling a new fuel variant rated at 98 RON marketed by the name of Pertamax Turbo, serving as a replacement for Pertamax Plus. Total and Shell stations only sell RON 92 and 95 gasoline. However, in early 2018, Shell launched a new variant "Regular", rated at 90 RON and currently sold at certain locations. Petronas has decided to shut down its retail business in Indonesia in 2012, after years of sluggish sales.
*Iran: 92 RON (marketed as regular) and 95 RON (marketed as Super) are widely available in gas stations.
*Ireland: 95&amp;nbsp;RON "unleaded" is the only gasoline type available through stations, although E5 (99&amp;nbsp;RON) is becoming more commonplace.
*Italy: 95&amp;nbsp;RON is the only compulsory gasoline offered (''verde'', "green"), only a few fuel stations (Agip, IP, IES, OMV) offer 98&amp;nbsp;RON as the premium type, many Shell and Tamoil stations close to the cities offer also V-Power Gasoline rated at 100&amp;nbsp;RON. Recently Agip introduced "Blu Super+", a 100 RON gasoline.
*Israel: 95&amp;nbsp;RON &amp; 98&amp;nbsp;RON are normally available at most automotive fuel stations. 96&amp;nbsp;RON is also available at a large number of gas stations but 95&amp;nbsp;RON is more preferred because it's cheaper and performance differences aren't very wide and noticeable. "Regular" fuel is 95&amp;nbsp;RON. All variants are unleaded.
*Japan: Since 1986, "regular" is &gt;=89&amp;nbsp;RON, and "high octane" is &gt;=96&amp;nbsp;RON, lead free. Those values are defined in standard JIS K 2202. Sometimes "high octane" is sold under different names, such as "F-1".
*Latvia: 95 RON and 98 RON widely available.
*Lebanon: 95 RON and 98 RON are widely available.
*Lithuania: 95 RON and 98 RON widely available. In some gas stations E85 (bioethanol) gasoline, 98E15 (15% of ethanol), 98E25 (25% of ethanol) are available.
*Malaysia: 95 RON, 97 RON and 100 RON. "Regular" unleaded fuel is 95&amp;nbsp;RON; "Premium" fuel is rated at 97&amp;nbsp;RON (Shell's V-Power Racing is rated 97&amp;nbsp;RON). Petron sells 100 RON in selected outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petrolworld.com/asia-headlines/malaysia-to-phase-out-ron-92-petrol-in-2009.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405063131/http://www.petrolworld.com/asia-headlines/malaysia-to-phase-out-ron-92-petrol-in-2009.html |archivedate=2012-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*México: Pemex Magna (87 AKI) is sold as a "regular" fuel and is available at every station. And Pemex Premium (92 AKI) is sold at almost all gas stations. Both variants are unleaded.
*Mongolia: 92 RON and 95 RON (advertised as A92 and A95 respectively) are available at nearly all stations while slightly fewer stations offer 80 RON (advertised as A80). 98 RON (advertised as A98) is available in select few stations.
*Montenegro: 95 RON is sold as a "regular" fuel. As a "premium" fuel, 98 RON is sold. Both variants are unleaded.
*Myanmar: Most petrol stations carry 92 RON as standard especially in rural areas. Most larger cities and highway stations have introduced 95 RON in the past few years. The highest grade available is 97 RON which is only sold by a few stations in Yangon and Nay Pyi Taw (e.g., PTT, MMTM, Petrotrans).
*Netherlands: 95&amp;nbsp;RON "Euro" is sold at every station, whereas 98&amp;nbsp;RON "Super Plus" is being phased out in favor of "premium" fuels, which are all 95 RON fuels with extra additives. Shell V-Power is a 97&amp;nbsp;RON (labelled as 95 due to the legalities of only using 95 or 98 labelling), some independent tests have shown that one year after introduction{{when|date=August 2013}} it was downgraded to 95 RON,{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} whereas in neighboring Germany Shell V-Power consists of the regular 100&amp;nbsp;RON fuel.
*New Zealand: 91&amp;nbsp;RON "Regular" and 95&amp;nbsp;RON "Premium" are both widely available. 98&amp;nbsp;RON is available instead of 95&amp;nbsp;RON at some (BP, Mobil, Gull) service stations in larger urban areas.
*Norway: 95 RON are widely available, but 98 RON is also available at Shell; it is 10-20% more expensive as 95 RON fuel. [[Statoil]] has discontinued production and sale due to low demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.altaposten.no/lokalt/nyheter/article9516487.ece |title=Tømmer tanken for 98 oktan |website=Altaposten.no |date=2014-04-15 |accessdate=2017-01-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407090426/http://www.altaposten.no/lokalt/nyheter/article9516487.ece |archivedate=2017-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Philippines: A brand of [[Petron Corporation|Petron]], Petron Blaze is rated at 100 RON (the only brand of gasoline in the Philippines without an [[ethanol]] blend). Other "super premium" brands like Petron XCS, Caltex Gold, Shell V-Power are rated at 95-97 RON, while Petron Xtra Unleaded, Caltex Silver, and Shell Super Unleaded are rated at 93 RON.
*Poland: Eurosuper 95 (RON 95) is sold in every gas station. Super Plus 98 (RON 98) is available in most stations, sometimes under brand (Orlen - Verva, BP - Ultimate, Shell - V-Power) and usually containing additives. Shell offers V-Power Racing fuel which is rated RON 100.
*Portugal: 95 RON "Euro" is sold in every station and 98 RON "Super" being offered in almost every station.
*Russia and [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries: 92&amp;nbsp;RON is the minimum available, the standard is  95&amp;nbsp;RON is sold in every gas station. 98&amp;nbsp;RON  is available in most stations. As a "premium" fuel, 100 RON is sold, Gazpromneft and Lukoil both variants are unleaded.
*Saudi Arabia: Two types of fuel are available at all petrol stations in Saudi Arabia. "Premium 91" (RON 91) where the pumps and liquid (look [[fuel dyes]]) are coloured green, and "Super Premium 95" (RON 95) where the pumps and liquid are coloured red. While petrol stations in Saudi Arabia are privatised, the prices are regulated by the authorities and have a fixed at [[Saudi riyal|SR]] 1.37 (USD 0.37) and SR 2.04 (USD 0.54) (as of 1 January, 2018) per litre respectively; and is currently being increased at an annual rate to bring it up to the worldwide average by 2020. Prior to 2006, only Super Premium RON 95 was available and the pumps weren't coloured in any specific order. The public didn't know what Octane rating was, therefore big educating campaigns were spread, telling the people to use the "red petrol" only for high end cars, and save money on using the "green petrol" for regular cars and trucks.
*Singapore: All four providers, [[Caltex]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[Singapore Petroleum Company Limited|SPC]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] have 3 grades of gasoline. Typically, these are 92, 95, and 98 RON. However, since 2009, [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] has removed 92 RON.
*South Africa: "regular" unleaded fuel is 95 RON in coastal areas. Inland (higher elevation) "regular" unleaded fuel is 93 RON; once again most fuel stations optionally offer 95 RON.
*South Korea: "regular" unleaded fuel is 91~94 RON, "premium" is 95+ RON nationally. However, not all gas stations carry "premium."
*Spain: 95 RON "Euro" is sold in every station with 98 RON "Super" being offered in most stations. Many stations around cities and highways offer other high-octane "premium" brands.
*Sri Lanka: In Ceypetco filling stations, 92 RON is the regular automotive fuel and 95 RON is called 'Super Petrol',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceypetco.gov.lk/Ceypetco_Products.htm|title=Ceylon Petroleum Corporation|work=ceypetco.gov.lk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531180434/http://ceypetco.gov.lk/Ceypetco_Products.htm|archivedate=2014-05-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which comes at a premium price. In LIOC filling stations, 90 RON remains as regular automotive fuel and 92 RON is available as 'Premium Petrol'. The cost of premium gasoline is lower than the cost of super gasoline. (Sri Lanka switched their regular gasoline from 90 RON to 92 RON on January 1, 2014)
*Sweden: 95 RON, 98 RON and E85 are widely available.
*Taiwan: 92 RON, 95 RON and 98 RON are widely available at gas stations in Taiwan.
*Thailand: 91 RON and 95 RON are widely available. 91 RON automotive fuel withdrawn on January 1, 2013 to increase uptake of gasohol fuels.
*Trinidad and Tobago: 92 RON (Super) and 95 RON (Premium) are widely available.
*Turkey: 95 RON and 95+ RON widely available in gas stations. 91 RON (Regular) has been dropped in 2006. 98 and 100 RON (Shell V-Power Racing) has been dropped in late 2009. The Gas which has been advertised 97 RON has been dropped in 2014 and renamed 95+.
*Ukraine: 80 RON gasoline is available, the standard gasoline is 92 RON, but 95 RON gasoline is also widely available and popular.
*United Kingdom: 'regular' gasoline has an octane rating of 95 RON, with 97 RON fuel being widely available as the ''Super Unleaded''. [[Tesco]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] both offer 99 RON fuel. In April 2006, [[BP]] started a public trial of the super-high [[octane]] [[gasoline]] ''BP Ultimate Unleaded 102'', which as the name suggests, has an octane rating of 102 RON.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/bp_ultimate/STAGING/brand_assets/downloads_pdfs/pq/bp_ultimate_uk_102_final_press_release.pdf|title=BP|work=bp.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214104236/http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/bp_ultimate/STAGING/brand_assets/downloads_pdfs/pq/bp_ultimate_uk_102_final_press_release.pdf|archivedate=2010-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although BP Ultimate Unleaded (with an octane rating of 97 RON) and BP Ultimate Diesel are both widely available throughout the UK, BP Ultimate Unleaded 102 was available throughout the UK in only 10 filling stations, and was priced at about two and half times more than their 97 RON fuel. In March 2010, BP stopped sales of Ultimate Unleaded 102, citing the closure of their specialty fuels manufacturing facility.&lt;ref name="bp.com"/&gt; Shell V-Power is also available, but in a 99 RON octane rating, and [[Tesco]] fuel stations also supply the [[Greenergy]] produced 99 RON "Momentum&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;".

This directly translates to less fuel and reduced absolute compression in the cylinder, therefore deterring knock. It is safe to fill a carbureted car that normally takes 87 AKI fuel at sea level with 85 AKI fuel in the mountains, but at sea level the fuel may cause damage to the engine. However, since virtually all cars produced since the mid-1980s have [[fuel injection]], 85 AKI fuel is not recommended for modern automobiles and may cause damage to the engine and decreased performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mark Phelan |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/05/29/bad-gasoline-low-octane-too-much-ethanol/2369579/ |title=Vacationers, beware: Bad gas can damage your car |website=Usatoday.com |date=2013-05-29 |accessdate=2017-01-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120013630/http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/05/29/bad-gasoline-low-octane-too-much-ethanol/2369579/ |archivedate=2016-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another disadvantage to this strategy is that most turbocharged vehicles are unable to produce full power, even when using the "premium" 91 AKI fuel.

*Venezuela: 91 RON and 95 RON gasoline is available nationwide, in all PDV gas stations. 95 RON gasoline is the most widely used in the country, although most cars in Venezuela would work with 91 RON gasoline. This is because gasoline prices are heavily subsidized by the government (0.$083 per gallon 95 RON, vs 0.$061 per gallon 91 RON). All gasoline in Venezuela is unleaded.
*Vietnam: 92 is in every gas station and 95 is in the urban area. They start selling A92-E5 gasoline (A92 with 5 percent of Ethanol) at 2017. On January 1, 2018, Vietnamese gorvernment forced every gas station stop selling 92 and sell 95 + A92-E5 instead.
*Zimbabwe: 93 octane available with no other grades of fuels available, E10 which is an ethanol blend of fuel at 10% ethanol is available the octane rating however is still to be tested and confirmed but it is assumed that its around 95 Octane. E85 available from 3 outlets with an octane rating AKI index of between 102-105 depending on the base gasoline the ethanol is blended with.

[[File:Italian olive oil 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|A bottle of [[olive oil]] used in food]]
{{Special characters}}

An '''oil''' is any [[polarity (chemistry)|nonpolar]] [[chemical substance]] that is a [[viscosity|viscous]] [[liquid]] at ambient temperatures and is both [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] (does not mix with [[water]], literally "water fearing") and [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] (mixes with other oils, literally "fat loving"). Oils have a high carbon and hydrogen content and are usually flammable and [[surfactant|surface active]].

The general definition of oil includes classes of chemical compounds that may be otherwise unrelated in structure, properties, and uses. Oils may be [[animal fats|animal]], [[vegetable oil|vegetable]], or [[petrochemistry|petrochemical]] in origin, and may be [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] or non-volatile.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|oil}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are used for food (e.g., [[olive oil]]), fuel (e.g., [[heating oil]]),  medical purposes (e.g., [[mineral oil]]), [[lubrication]] (e.g. [[motor oil]]), and the manufacture of many types of paints, plastics, and other materials. Specially prepared oils are used in some religious ceremonies and rituals as purifying agents.

== Etymology ==
First attested in English 1176, the word ''oil'' comes from [[Old French]] ''oile'', from [[Latin]] ''oleum'',&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|oleum|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἔλαιον}} (''elaion''), "olive oil, oil"&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|e)/laion|ἔλαιον|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and that from {{lang|grc|ἐλαία}} (''elaia''), "[[olive]] tree", "olive fruit".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|e)lai/a|ἐλαία|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|oil}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest attested forms of the word are the [[Mycenaean Greek]] {{lang|gmy|𐀁𐀨𐀺}}, ''e-ra-wo'' and {{lang|gmy|𐀁𐁉𐀺}}, ''e-rai-wo'', written in the [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Linear B word e-ra-wo|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ShowWord.aspx?Id=16728|website=Palaeolexicon. Word study tool of ancient languages}} {{cite web|url=http://minoan.deaditerranean.com/resources/linear-b-sign-groups/e/e-ra3-wo/|title=e-ra3-wo}} {{cite web|last=Raymoure|first=K.A.|url=http://minoan.deaditerranean.com/resources/linear-b-sign-groups/e/e-ra-wo/|title=e-ra-wo|work=Minoan Linear A &amp; Mycenaean Linear B|publisher=Deaditerranean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Organic oils ===
Organic oils are produced in remarkable diversity by plants, animals, and other organisms through natural [[metabolic]] processes. ''[[Lipid]]'' is the scientific term for the [[fatty acid]]s, [[steroid]]s and similar chemicals often found in the oils produced by living things, while oil refers to an overall mixture of chemicals. Organic oils may also contain chemicals other than lipids, including [[protein]]s, [[wax]]es (class of compounds with oil-like properties that are solid at common temperatures) and [[alkaloid]]s.

Lipids can be classified by the way that they are made by an organism, their chemical structure and their limited [[solubility]] in water compared to oils. They have a high [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]] content and are considerably lacking in [[oxygen]] compared to other organic compounds and minerals; they tend to be relatively [[Chemical polarity|nonpolar]] molecules, but may include both polar and nonpolar regions as in the case of [[phospholipid]]s and steroids.&lt;ref name=alberts&gt;Alberts, Bruce; Johnson, Alexander; Lewis, Julian; Raff, Martin; Roberts, Keith; Walter, Peter. ''Molecular Biology of the Cell''. New York: Garland Science, 2002, pp. 62, 118-119.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mineral oils ===
Crude oil, or [[petroleum]], and its refined components, collectively termed ''[[petrochemicals]]'', are crucial resources in the modern economy. Crude oil originates from ancient [[fossilized]] [[organic material]]s, such as [[zooplankton]] and [[algae]], which [[geochemical]] processes convert into oil.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.orggeochem.2005.09.001
|title=Organic geochemistry – A retrospective of its first 70 years
|year=2006|last1=Kvenvolden|first1=Keith A.|journal=Organic Geochemistry
|volume=37|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name "mineral oil" is a [[misnomer]], in that minerals are not the source of the oil—ancient plants and animals are. Mineral oil is organic. However, it is classified as "mineral oil" instead of as "organic oil" because its organic origin is remote (and was unknown at the time of its discovery), and because it is obtained in the vicinity of rocks, underground traps, and sands. ''[[Mineral oil]]'' also refers to several specific distillates of crude oil.

== Applications ==

=== Cooking ===
{{Main article|Cooking oil}}
Several edible vegetable and animal oils, and also [[fat]]s, are used for various purposes in cooking and food preparation. In particular, many foods are fried in oil much hotter than boiling water. Oils are also used for flavoring and for modifying the texture of foods (e.g. [[stir frying|Stir Fry]]). Cooking oils are derived either from animal fat, as [[butter]], [[lard]] and other types, or plant oils from the [[olive oil|olive]], [[corn oil|maize]], [[sunflower oil|sunflower]] and many other species.

=== Cosmetics ===
Oils are applied to hair to give it a lustrous look, to prevent tangles and roughness and to stabilize the hair to promote growth. See [[hair conditioner]].

=== Religion ===
Oil has been used throughout history as a religious medium. It is often considered a spiritually purifying agent and is used for [[anointing]] purposes. As a particular example, [[holy anointing oil]] has been an important ritual liquid for [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]].

=== Painting ===
Color [[pigments]] are easily [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] in oil, making it suitable as a supporting medium for [[Oil paint|paints]]. The oldest known extant oil paintings date from 650 AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/02/19/oldest-oil-painting.html "Oldest Oil Paintings Found in Afghanistan"], Rosella Lorenzi, Discovery News. Feb. 19, 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603234713/http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/02/19/oldest-oil-painting.html |date=June 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heat transfer ===&lt;!--Redirect points to this section--&gt;
{{See also|Transformer oil}}
Oils are used as coolants in [[oil cooling]], for instance in electric [[Transformer#Coolant|transformers]]. Heat transfer oils are used both as [[coolant]]s (see [[oil cooling]]), for heating (e.g. in [[oil heater]]s) and in other applications of heat transfer.

=== Lubrication ===
Given that they are non-polar, oils do not easily adhere to other substances. This makes them useful as [[lubricants]] for various engineering purposes. Mineral oils are more commonly used as machine lubricants than biological oils are. [[Whale oil]] is preferred for lubricating clocks, because it does not evaporate, leaving dust, although its use was banned in the USA in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frankenmuthclock.com/questionscuckoo.htm|title=Bavarian Clock Haus and Frankenmuth Clock Company|work=Frankenmuth Clock Company &amp; Bavarian Clock Haus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a long-running myth that [[spermaceti]] from whales has still been used in NASA projects such as the [[Hubble Telescope]] and the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probe because of its extremely low freezing temperature. Spermaceti is not actually an oil, but a mixture mostly of wax esters, and there is no evidence that NASA has used whale oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ksj.mit.edu/tracker/2014/03/who-would-believe-nasa-used-whale-oil-vo/|title=Troubled waters: Who Would Believe NASA Used Whale Oil on Voyager and Hubble?|work=Knight Science Journalism at MIT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fuel ===
[[File:Motor oil.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Synthetic motor oil]]
Some oils [[Combustion|burn]] in liquid or [[aerosol]] form, generating [[light]], and [[heat]] which can be used directly or converted into other forms of energy such as electricity or mechanical work. To obtain many fuel oils, [[crude oil]] is pumped from the ground and is shipped via [[oil tanker]] or a [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] to an [[oil refinery]]. There, it is converted from crude oil to [[diesel fuel]] (petrodiesel), [[ethane]] (and other short-chain [[alkanes]]), [[fuel oil]]s (heaviest of commercial fuels, used in ships/furnaces), [[gasoline]] (petrol), [[jet fuel]], [[kerosene]], [[benzene]] (historically), and [[liquefied petroleum gas]]. A 42-gallon barrel (U.S.) of crude oil produces approximately 10 gallons of diesel, 4 gallons of jet fuel, 19 gallons of gasoline, 7 gallons of other products, 3 gallons split between heavy fuel oil and liquified petroleum gases,&lt;ref name=EIA&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.cfm?page=oil_home U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)] — Retrieved 2011-10-02.&lt;/ref&gt; and 2 gallons of heating oil. The total production of a barrel of crude into various products results in an increase to 45 gallons.&lt;ref name=EIA/&gt; Not all oils used as fuels are mineral oils, see [[biodiesel]] and [[vegetable oil fuel]].

In the 18th and 19th centuries, [[whale oil]] was commonly used for lamps, which was replaced with natural gas and then electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petroleumhistory.org/OilHistory/pages/Whale/whale.html|title=Whale Oil|work=petroleumhistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemical feedstock ===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2017}}

Crude oil can be refined into a wide variety of component [[hydrocarbons]]. ''[[Petrochemicals]]'' are the refined [[components of crude oil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eya6BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=%C2%A0+Petrochemicals+are+refined+components+of+crude+oil&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbi4yxp-7UAhVBi1QKHb_GC0UQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0%20Petrochemicals%20are%20refined%20components%20of%20crude%20oil&amp;f=false|title=Oil Pollution in the Baltic Sea|last=Kostianoy|first=Andrey G.|last2=Lavrova|first2=Olga Yu|date=2014-07-08|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642384769|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the chemical products made from them. They are used as [[detergents]], [[fertilizers]], [[medicines]], [[paints]], [[plastics]], [[synthetic fiber]]s, and [[synthetic rubber]].

Organic oils are another important chemical feedstock, especially in [[green chemistry]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It outlined a series of hypothetical international events taking place in December 2005, all related to world supply and demand of [[petroleum]]. Participants in the scenario [[role play|role-played]] [[Cabinet of the United States|Presidential Cabinet]] officials, who were asked to discuss and respond to the events.  The hypothetical events included civil unrest in [[OPEC]] country [[Nigeria]], and coordinated terrorist attacks on ports in [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Alaska]]. In the original [[simulation]], the participants had all previously held jobs closely related to their roles in the exercise.

Jason Grumet, from the ''[[National Commission on Energy Policy]]'', said that the message of the simulation was that, "very modest disruptions in oil supply, whether they're here at home or abroad can have truly devastating impacts on our nations economy and our overall security."

== Details of the scenario ==
The original event was performed June 23, 2005, and was a simulation of December 2005, six months in the future.  The first scenario involved civil unrest in [[Nigeria]], a member of the [[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]], resulting in oil companies and the US government evacuating their personnel from the country. In the simulation, this led to decrease in oil supply and the price spikes causing a variety of negative effects on the United States economy. 

More events followed as the scenario progressed, including a very cold winter in the Northern hemisphere, terrorist attacks on Saudi Arabian and Alaskan oil ports, and [[Al-Qaeda]] cells hijacking oil tankers and crashing them into the docking facilities at the ports (which might effectively shut down such port for weeks, if not months).

The scenarios were set up with pre-produced scripted news clips. Participants were also given briefing memos with background information related to their specific cabinet positions. The participants discussed and prepared policy recommendations for an unseen Chief Executive after each part of the scenario.

==Original participants==
The original event was a one-time exercise and used participants that held positions that were identical or closely related to their positions in the simulation. Participants included former administrator of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] Carol Browner, former [[Director of Central Intelligence]] Robert Gates, former Marine Corps Commendant and member of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] General P.X. Kelley USMC (Ret.), and former National Economic Advisor to the President, Gene Sperling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secureenergy.org/reports/oil_shock_report_master.pdf Simulation Report and Summary of Findings]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5469">'''Oriented structural straw board''' (OSSB) is an engineered board that is made by splitting [[straw]] and formed by adding [[formaldehyde]]-free [[adhesive]]s and then hot compressing layers of straw in specific orientations. Research and development for OSSB panels began in the mid 1980s and was spearheaded by The Alberta Research Council, Canada (today AITF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buildwelllibrary.org/building-materials/fibers/straw/straw-panels/25-oriented-split-straw-board-a-new-era-in-building-products-wasyclciw-2001-1/file |title=Oriented split Straw Board - A New Era in Building Products |publisher=Builddwelllibrary.org |accessdate=2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which identified the straw strand manufacturing technology using formaldehyde-free (p-MDI) adhesives.

==Uses==

OSSB can replace wood [[oriented strand board]] (OSB) and [[particle board]] in structural and non-structural applications, such as interior and exterior walls for house construction, furniture and interior decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsu.edu/bioresources/BioRes_07/BioRes_07_3_2986_Han_CME_Zn_Borate_OS_Straw_Bd_Termite_Trial_2741.pdf |format=PDF |title=Performance of Zinc Borate-Treated Oriented Structural Straw Board against Mold Fungi, Decay Fungi, and Termites - A Preliminary Trial |publisher=Ncsu.edu |accessdate=2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-MCGY201003017.htm |title=Utilization of Wheat Straw as a Building Material——Oriented Structural Straw Board in a Housing System-《China Wood Industry》2010年03期 |publisher=En.cnki.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; OSSB panels are formaldehyde-free, they are also used for applications where air quality is a concern, such as kindergartens, hospitals, bedrooms, and hotels.

==Manufacturing==
OSSB panel manufacturing starts with careful selection of straw fibres, which are then cut, cleaned, split and dried. Splitting straws allows resin to coat what would otherwise be the inside of a hollow straw.  Producing split straw of sufficient length was the key technical innovation making OSSBs possible.  OSSB is thus sometimes referred to as oriented split straw board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wasylciw|first1=Wayne|title=Oriented Split Straw Board – A New Era In Building Products|journal=American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers Annual Meeting|date=2001|doi=10.13031/2013.4213|url=http://elibrary.asabe.org/abstract.asp?aid=4213|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Formaldehyde free resin is added to the straw and the fibres are oriented for strength and appearance, and shaped into a mat through directional mat forming. The mat is then pressed between heated belts, water is vaporized, transferring heat into the straw. The heat cures the adhesive and causes a series of physical and chemical changes to the pressurized raw materials, which harden the final product.

==Production==
One producer of OSSB on a commercial scale is Novofibre Panel Board Holding China, Ltd., located in Yangling, Shaanxi province in China. Currently, their factory has a {{convert|60,000|m3|cuft cuyd|sigfig=3|adj=on}} yearly capacity.

==Properties==
OSSB panels have high structural strength, load bearing and stability in both directions, as well as superior workability and excellent nail holding properties on all sides. Water permeability treated OSSB panels are more water resistant than treated traditional wood panel boards because they have no internal gaps or voids. OSSB panels are also highly earthquake resistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albertatechfutures.ca/NewsRoom/NewsReleases/2009NewsReleases/ARCCelebratesOSSB%E2%80%9CWheatboard%E2%80%9DinChina.aspx |title=ARC Celebrates OSSB “Wheatboard” in China |publisher=Albertatechfutures.ca |date=2009-10-29 |accessdate=2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The resin used to manufacture OSSB is p-MDI, which does not emit [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) and is formaldehyde-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbpionline.com/features/mdi-a-simple-equation-for-osb-production/ |title=MDI – a simple equation for OSB production? - Wood Based Panels |publisher=Wbpionline.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The raw material can be treated by various [[borate]] compounds, which are toxic to termites, beetles, molds, and fungi, but not to mammals in applied doses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ojs.cnr.ncsu.edu/index.php/BioRes/article/view/BioRes_07_3_2986_Han_Zinc_Borate_Strawboard_Fungi_Termites/0 |title=Performance Of Zinc Borate-Treated Oriented Structural Straw Board Against Mold Fungi, Decay Fungi, And Termites – A Preliminary Trial &amp;#124; Han &amp;#124; Bioresources |publisher=Ojs.cnr.ncsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
OSSB boards are available in thicknesses varying from {{convert|3|–|30|mm|2|abbr=in}} in different densities.
Novofibre Panel Board Holding China, Ltd., manufactures 3 standard products:
# OSSB1 - General purpose boards for construction and interior decoration.
# OSSB 3 - Load-bearing boards for use in construction with high strength stability needs.
# OSSB DECO–multipurpose boards with a unique elegant texture, which is especially suitable for decoration.
# OSSB panels can be produced in a range of finished products for acoustic, floor or home applications keeping the natural straw surface appearance.

== What type of thing is nuclear power? ==

Nuclear power can be described as all of the following:

* [[Nuclear technology]] ([[Outline of nuclear technology|outline]]) &amp;ndash; technology that involves the reactions of atomic nuclei. Among the notable nuclear technologies are nuclear power, nuclear medicine, and nuclear weapons. It has found applications from smoke detectors to nuclear reactors, and from gun sights to nuclear weapons.
* [[Electricity generation]] &amp;ndash; the process of generating [[electric energy]] from other [[forms of energy]]. The fundamental principles of electricity generation were discovered during the 1820s and early 1830s by the British scientist [[Michael Faraday]].  His basic method is still used today: electricity is generated by the movement of a loop of wire, or disc of copper between the poles of a [[magnet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theiet.org/about/libarc/archives/biographies/faraday.cfm 'The Institution of Engineering &amp; Technology: Michael Faraday']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parasporal body''' is a crystalline protein that forms around a spore in some bacteria that acts as a toxin precursor{{explain|date=June 2017}} when digested.

For example, ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' and ''Bacillus sphaericus'' form a solid [[protein]] crystal, the parasporal body, next to their [[endospores]] during spore formation. The ''B. thuringiensis'' parasporal body contains protein toxins that kill over 100 species of moths by dissolving in the alkaline gut of caterpillars and destroying the [[epithelium]]. The solubilized toxin proteins are cleaved by mid-gut [[protease]]s to smaller toxic [[polypeptides]] that attack the gut [[epithelial cells]]. The alkaline gut contents escape into the blood, causing paralysis and death. One of these toxins has been shown to form pores in the [[plasma membrane]] of the target insect's cells. These channels allow [[Monovalent ion|monovalent]] cations such as potassium to pass through. 

''B. thuringiensis'' toxin genes have been engineered to make a variety of pest-resistant, [[genetically modified]] plants. The ''B. sphaericus'' parasporal body contains proteins toxic for mosquito larvae and may be useful in controlling the mosquitoes that carry the malaria parasite ''Plasmodium''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2698">{{short description| relation of the partial pressure of water in air to temperature }}
The '''psychrometric constant''' &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; relates the [[partial pressure]] of water in air to the air temperature.  This lets one [[interpolate]] actual vapor pressure from paired dry and wet [[thermometer]] bulb temperature  readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first=R.G. |author2=Pereira, L.S. |author3=Raes, D. |author4= Smith, M.  |title=Crop Evapotranspiration—Guidelines for Computing Crop Water Requirements |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/X0490E/x0490e00.HTM |accessdate=2007-10-08 |series=FAO Irrigation and drainage paper 56 |year=1998 |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |location=Rome, Italy |isbn=92-5-104219-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;  \gamma =\frac{ \left( c_p \right)_{air} *  P }{ \lambda_v * MW_{ratio} } &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;   \gamma = &lt;/math&gt; psychrometric constant [kPa °C&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;],

: P = atmospheric pressure [kPa],

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_v = &lt;/math&gt; [[latent heat]] of water vaporization, 2.26 [MJ kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;],

:&lt;math&gt; c_p = &lt;/math&gt; [[specific heat]] of air at constant pressure, [MJ kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; °C&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;],

:&lt;math&gt; MW_{ratio} = &lt;/math&gt; ratio [[molecular weight]] of water vapor/dry air = 0.622.

Both &lt;math&gt; \lambda_v &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; MW_{ratio} &lt;/math&gt; are constants.&lt;br&gt;
Since [[atmospheric pressure]], P,  depends upon altitude, so does &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
At higher [[altitude]] water evaporates and boils at lower temperature.

Although &lt;math&gt; \left( c_p \right)_{H_2 O} &lt;/math&gt; is constant, varied air composition results in varied &lt;math&gt; \left( c_p \right)_{air} &lt;/math&gt;.

Thus on average, at a given location or altitude, the psychrometric constant is approximately constant.  Still, it is worth remembering that weather impacts both atmospheric pressure and composition.

== vapor pressure estimation ==
Saturated vapor pressure, &lt;math&gt;e_s = e \left[ T_{wet}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Actual vapor pressure,   &lt;math&gt;e_a = e_s - \gamma * \left( T_{dry} - T_{wet} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

: here e[T]  is vapor pressure as a function of temperature, T.
::T&lt;sub&gt;dew&lt;/sub&gt; = the [[dewpoint]] temperature at which water condenses.
::T&lt;sub&gt;wet&lt;/sub&gt; = the temperature of a wet thermometer bulb from which water can evaporate to air.
::T&lt;sub&gt;dry&lt;/sub&gt; = the temperature of a dry thermometer bulb in air.

==Policy==
Policy that supports renewable energy development in Luxembourg is the 1993 Framework Law (amended in 2005), in which there are special tariffs given to different type of renewable energy used and subsidies available for private companies that invest in renewable energy technology.

==Generation==
In 2005, renewable energy contributed to the 24.8% electricity generation in the country, which comprises pump storage (19.0%), hydro (2.3%), biomass (1.8%), wind (1.3%) and solar (0.4%).&lt;ref name="energy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.eu/renewables/factsheets/2008_res_sheet_luxembourg_en.pdf|date=23 January 2008|title=Luxembourg Renewable Energy Fact Sheet|accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robin Hood Energy''' is a [[Not for Profit]] Energy Company launched in September 2015 by [[Nottingham City Council]] as a competitor to the [[Big Six Energy Suppliers (UK)]]. The company operates as both an energy generator and supplier. Nottingham City Council wholly own the company making it the first local authority energy company in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-34171736|title=Nottingham City Council energy company claims UK first|date=7 September 2015|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2016|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior none had existed since the UK energy system was nationalised in 1948&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/463562/Nottingham-City-Council-sets-up-energy-company|title=Robin Hood's giving power to the people: Council sets up own energy company|date=7 September 2015|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the [[Electricity Act 1947]] and subsequently privatised in 1990 under the [[Electricity Act 1989]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://robinhoodenergy.co.uk/about-us|title=About us - RobinHoodenergy|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/energy/2015/09/new-not-for-profit-energy-provider-launches-but-is-robin-hood-energy-any-good|title=Not-for-profit energy provider launches, but is Robin Hood Energy any good?|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the organisation is provide low cost energy to all households and address fuel poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/jun/03/energy-companies-council-run-market-london|title=Energy companies are cheaper and cleaner when run by the council|first=Michael|last=Jacobs|date=3 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides special tariffs to residents within the boundaries of the Nottingham City Council and provides a socially orientated pricing structure to the entirety of the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localgov.co.uk/Council-energy-companies-creating-competitive-energy-tariffs/40982|title=Council energy companies creating competitive energy tariffs|first=Hemming Group|last=Ltd|date=3 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company operates Not for Profit by keeping overheads as low as possible, does not pay bonuses to staff and none of the organisation's directors are paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.energylinx.co.uk/robin-hood-energy.html|title=Robin Hood Energy|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aspokesmansaid.com/energy/our-reviews/content-8493/robin-hood-energy-review|title=Robin Hood Energy Review|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the company rare within the UK energy market as a Not For Profit company.

== Energy Mix ==
The company generates electricity from the city’s incinerator, solar panels and waste food plants while also buying in gas and electricity from the UK electricity and gas markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/07/robin-hood-energy-nottingham-council-launches-not-for-profit-energy-company|title=Robin Hood Energy: Nottingham launches not-for-profit power firm|first=David|last=Hellier|date=7 September 2015|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture of energy generated and bought from markets to be sold to consumers has not been revealed at this time. Robin Hood Energy will publish its first Fuel Mix Disclosure in the summer of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://robinhoodenergy.co.uk/home-energy/help-advice|title=Help &amp; advice - Home energy - RobinHoodenergy|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== White Rose Energy ==
Robin Hood Energy partnered with [[Leeds City Council]] to establish as of September 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.energylinx.co.uk/white-rose-energy.html|title=White Rose Energy|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; White Rose Energy, an iniative to provide affordble energy to residents in Leeds and Yorkshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whiteroseenergy.co.uk/about-us|title=About Us - White Rose Energy|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leeds.gov.uk/council/Pages/White-Rose-Energy.aspx|title=White Rose Energy|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ebico ==
Robin Hood Energy was announced on March 10, 2017 as the new supply partner for Not For Profit energy provider and registered Social Enterprise Ebico.&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|1127587|The Ebico Trust For Sustainable Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; This began a transition of Ebico customers who opted in to be transferred to the new Ebico Zero Tariffs provided by Robin Hood Energy. In the decision to opt for a relationship with Robin Hood Energy Ebico stated "we wanted to ensure our supply partner shared the same values as us; something Robin Hood Energy does in its mission to provide its customers with low-cost energy." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ebico.org.uk/ebico-news/new-cheaper-gas-and-electricity-tariffs-under-the-new-partnership-with-robin-hood-energy/|title=New, cheaper, energy deals under the new partnership with Robin Hood Energy|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision by Ebico to end its partnership with its former supply partner [[SSE plc]] was due to SSE deciding to close Ebico's EquiGas/EquiPower tariffs to new sales.

The partnership was welcomed by a number of prominent politicians including [[Jesse Norman]] MP - Minister for Energy and Industry, Dr. [[Alan Whitehead]] MP - Shadow Minister for Energy and Climate Change and [[Callum McCaig]] MP - SNP Spokesperson on Energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ebico.org.uk/ebico-news/cross-party-support-for-ebico-and-robin-hood-energy-partnership-to-fight-fuel-poverty-in-the-uk/

'''Silvology''' ([[Latin]], [[sylva (disambiguation)|silva or sylva]], "forests and woods"; and {{lang-grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'', "''science of'' or ''study of''") is the biological science of studying [[forests|forests and woods]], incorporating the understanding of natural forest [[ecosystems]], and the effects and development of [[silviculture|silvicultural]] practices. The term compliments [[silviculture]], which deals with the art and practice of forest management.&lt;ref&gt;Hemery, G., and J.P. Skovsgaard. 2018. “Silvology: Redefining the Biological Science for the Study of Forests.” Quarterly Journal of Forestry 112 (April) (2): 128–31. https://gabrielhemery.com/silvology-defined/&lt;/ref&gt;

Silvology is seen as a single science for forestry and was first used by Roeloff Oldeman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oldeman|first=R.A.A.|title=Forests: elements of silvology|year=1990|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin|isbn=0-387-51883-5|pages=624}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It integrates the study of forests and forest ecology, dealing with single [[tree]] [[autecology]] and natural [[forest ecology]].

'''''Sludge''''' is a 2005 documentary film by [[Appalshop]] filmmaker Robert Salyer chronicling the [[Martin County Sludge Spill]] that was an accident that occurred after midnight on October 11, 2000 when a [[coal]] [[Coal slurry impoundment|sludge impoundment]] in [[Martin County, Kentucky]], broke through an underground mine below, propelling 306 million gallons of sludge down two tributaries of the [[Tug Fork River]]. The movie documents the continuing story of the Martin County disaster, the resulting federal investigation, and the looming threat of coal sludge ponds throughout the coalfield region.

In the United States today, coal is the largest single source of fuel for energy production. Annually, the country mines over a billion tons of coal. Coal waste is a consequence of this consumption; the [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] has estimated that there are over 235 sludge ponds throughout the region with the potential to break into an underground mine, as the Martin County pond did in 2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2663">The '''sponge iron reaction''' (SIR) is a chemical process based on [[redox]] cycling of an iron-based contact mass, the first cycle is a conversion step between [[iron]] metal (Fe) and [[wuestite]] (FeO), the second cycle is a conversion step between wuestite (FeO) and [[magnetite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/doc/ARI/ARI%20Study%20Report/ACT-RPT-NRG-ARI-04-2301-Sponge%20Iron%20Process-Graz.pdf Sponge iron process for manned space exploration]&lt;/ref&gt; In application, the SIT is used in the '''reformer sponge iron cycle''' (RESC) in combination with a [[steam reforming]] unit.

==Process description==
The process has two modes, a reduction mode and an oxidation mode.
===Iron-wuestite===         
{{chem|Fe|O}} + {{chem|H|2}} ↔ {{chem|Fe}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}

===Magnetite-wuestite===   
{{chem|Fe|3|O|4}} + {{chem|H|2}} ↔ 3{{chem|Fe|O}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}

==Application==
The reformer sponge iron cycle is a two step cycle to produce [[hydrogen]] from [[hydrocarbon fuel]]s based SIR and steam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=14863380 A novel process for stationary hydrogen production: the reformer sponge iron cycle]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformer sponge iron cycle===
In the first step the [[hydrocarbon fuel]] is reformed to [[syngas]] in the reformer which is then used to reduce the [[iron oxide]] ([[magnetite]]—Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) to iron ([[wüstite]]—FeO), in the second step steam is utilized to re-oxidise the iron into magnetite and hydrogen. The iron oxide [[Pelletizing|pellets]] are placed in a pelletbed and have a [[service life]] of several thousand [[redox]] cycles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TH1-4G94HVT-4&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=3c0c6f5c75eaa384c993c9d0d53fbcde First investigations of structural changes of the contact mass in the RESC process for hydrogen production]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Department of Energy National Laboratories and Technology Centers''' are a system of facilities and laboratories overseen by the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) for the purpose of advancing [[science]] and technology to fulfill the DOE mission. Sixteen of the seventeen DOE national laboratories are [[federally funded research and development centers]] administered, managed, operated and staffed by private-sector organizations under management and operating (M&amp;O) contract with DOE.

== History ==
The system of centralized national laboratories grew out of the massive scientific endeavors of [[World War II]], in which new technologies such as [[radar]], the [[computer]], the [[proximity fuze]], and the [[atomic bomb]] proved decisive for the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory. Though the United States government had begun seriously investing in scientific research for national security since [[World War I]], it was only in late 1930s and 1940s that monumental amounts of resources were committed or coordinated to wartime scientific problems, under the auspices first of the [[National Defense Research Committee]], and later the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]], organized and administered by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] engineer [[Vannevar Bush]].

During the second world war, centralized sites such as the [[Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology|Radiation Laboratory]] at MIT and [[Ernest O. Lawrence]]'s [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|laboratory]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] allowed for a large number of expert scientists to collaborate towards defined goals as never before, and with virtually unlimited government resources at their disposal.

In the course of the war, the Allied nuclear effort, the [[Manhattan Project]], created several secret sites for the purpose of bomb research and material development, including a laboratory in the mountains of [[New Mexico]] directed by [[Robert Oppenheimer]] ([[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]]), and sites at [[Hanford Site|Hanford, Washington]] and [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge, Tennessee]]. Hanford and Oak Ridge were administered by private companies, and Los Alamos was administered by a public university (the [[University of California]]). Additional success was had at the [[University of Chicago]] in [[nuclear reactor|reactor]] research, leading to the creation of [[Argonne National Laboratory]] outside Chicago, and at other academic institutions spread across the country.

After the war and its scientific successes, the newly created [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] took over the future of the wartime laboratories, extending their lives indefinitely (they were originally thought of as temporary creations). Funding and infrastructure were secured to sponsor other "national laboratories" for both classified and basic research, especially in [[physics]], with each national laboratory centered around one or many expensive machines (such as [[particle accelerators]] or [[nuclear reactors]]). 

Most national laboratories maintained staffs of local researchers as well as allowing for visiting researchers to use their equipment, though priority to local or visiting researchers often varied from lab to lab. With their centralization of resources (both monetary and intellectual), the national labs serve as an exemplar for [[Big Science]].

Elements of both competition and cooperation were encouraged in the laboratories. Often two laboratories with similar missions were created (such as [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Lawrence Livermore]] which was designed to compete with [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]]) with the hope that competition over funding would create a culture of high quality work. Laboratories which did not have overlapping missions would cooperate with each other (for example, Lawrence Livermore would cooperate with the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory]], which itself was often in competition with [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]). The idea of regional laboratories to work with local universities for nuclear development originated with [[Arthur Compton]] and [[Charles Allen Thomas]], though [[Leslie Groves]] later claimed the idea as his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Nichols |first= Kenneth David |title= The Road to Trinity: A Personal Account of How America's Nuclear Policies Were Made |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear=  |year=  |publisher= William Morrow and Company |location= New York |isbn= 0-688-06910-X |oclc= 15223648 |page= 232 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The national laboratory system, administered first by the Atomic Energy Commission, then the [[Energy Research and Development Administration]], and currently the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], is one of the largest (if not the largest) scientific research systems in the world. The DOE provides more than 40% of the total national funding for [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[materials science]], and other areas of the [[physical sciences]]. Many are locally managed by private companies, while others are managed by academic universities, and as a system they form one of the overarching and far-reaching components in what is known as the "[[Iron triangle (US politics)|iron triangle]]" of [[military]], [[academia]], and [[industry]].

In [[fiction]], [[engineering]], and [[thought experiment]]s, '''unobtainium''' is any fictional, extremely rare, costly, or impossible material, or (less commonly) device needed to fulfill a given design for a given application. The properties of any particular unobtainium depend on the intended use. For example, a [[pulley]] made of unobtainium might be massless and frictionless; however, if used in a [[nuclear propulsion|nuclear rocket]], unobtainium might be light, strong at high temperatures, and resistant to radiation damage. The concept of unobtainium is often applied flippantly or humorously. For instance, unobtainium is described as being stronger than steel, and lighter than helium{{where|date=August 2018}}.

The word ''[[wikt:unobtainium|unobtainium]]'' derives humorously from ''[[wikt:unobtainable|unobtainable]]'' with the suffix ''[[wikt:-ium|-ium]]'', the conventional designation for a [[chemical element]]. It pre-dates the similar-sounding IUPAC [[systematic element name]]s, such as [[ununennium]].  An alternative spelling, '''unobtanium''' is sometimes used (for example, for the [[crypto-currency]] Unobtanium), based on the spelling of metals such as [[titanium]].

== Engineering origin ==
Since the late 1950s,{{Efn|"unobtainium, n. A substance having the exact high test properties required for a piece of hardware or other item of use, but not obtainable either because it theoretically cannot exist or because technology is insufficiently advanced to produce it. Humorous or ironical." Listed in "Interim Glossary, Aero-Space Terms," as compiled by Woodford Heflin and published in February 1958 by the Air University of the US Air Force.}}&lt;ref name="Langley"&gt;Since at least the 1950s: [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4305/sp4305.htm Hansen, James R. (1987) "Engineer in Charge: A History of the Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, 1917–1958." The NASA History Series, sp-4305.] Chapter 12, recounting an October 1957 meeting, mentions the problems caused by "the lack of a superior high-temperature material (which the Langley structures people dubbed 'unobtainium')" This paragraph in turn cites Becker, John V. "[http://crgis.ndc.nasa.gov/crgis/images/5/5f/Becker1983.pdf The Development of Winged Reentry Vehicles, 1952–1963]," unpublished, dated 23 May 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; aerospace engineers have used the term ''"unobtainium"'' when referring to unusual or costly materials, or when theoretically considering a material perfect for their needs in all respects, except that it does not exist.  By the 1990s, the term was in wide use, even in formal engineering papers such as "Towards unobtainium &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;new composite materials for space applications&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=TRD&amp;recid=200114009286MT&amp;recid=A9116974AH&amp;q=towards+unobtainium&amp;uid=788302480&amp;setcookie=yes |archivedate=2009-04-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424223613/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=TRD&amp;recid=200114009286MT&amp;recid=A9116974AH&amp;q=towards+unobtainium&amp;uid=788302480&amp;setcookie=yes |title=Towards unobtainium &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;new composite materials for space applications&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; |last=Misra |first=Mohan &lt;!-- see www.itnes.com/misra.html--&gt;|journal=Aerospace Composites and Materials |volume=2 |pages=29–32 |date=Nov–Dec 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

The word ''unobtainium'' may well have been coined in the aerospace industry to refer to materials capable of withstanding the extreme temperatures expected in [[atmospheric reentry|re-entry]].&lt;ref name="Langley" /&gt; [[Aerospace engineering|Aerospace engineers]] are frequently tempted to design aircraft which require parts with strength or resilience beyond that of currently available materials.

Later, ''unobtainium'' became an engineering term for practical materials that really exist, but are difficult to get.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metalsuppliersonline.com/research/Charts/periodic/113Unobtainium.asp |title=Unobtainium |publisher=Metal Suppliers Online |accessdate=2010-06-04 |quote=We can loosely define it as any metal that is specified by Engineering and unavailable to Purchasing }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, during the development of the [[SR-71 Blackbird]] spy plane, [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] engineers at the "[[Skunk Works]]" under Clarence "Kelly" Johnson used ''unobtainium'' as a [[dysphemism]] for ''[[titanium]].'' Titanium allowed a higher strength-to-weight ratio at the high temperatures the Blackbird would reach, but the [[Soviet Union]] controlled its supply and was trying to deprive the US armed forces of this [[Resource (economics)|resource]].{{Efn|Relatively large amounts of titanium are used in aircraft such as the F-15, F-18, and F-22 fighters and the B-1 bomber.}}

In the 1970s, driver and engineer [[Mark Donohue]] claimed unobtainium was used in the construction of [[Penske]] race cars&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2013/05/28/racing-heroes-mark-donohue/|title=https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2013/05/28/racing-heroes-mark-donohue/|website=www.hemmings.com|access-date=2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Contemporary popularization ==
By 2010, the term had diffused beyond engineering, and now can appear in the headlines of mainstream newspapers, especially to describe the commercially useful [[rare-earth metals|rare earth elements]] (particularly [[terbium]], [[erbium]], [[dysprosium]], [[yttrium]], and [[neodymium]]). These are essential to the performance of [[consumer electronics]] and [[green technology]], but the projected [[Demand (economics)|demand]] for them so outstrips their current supply that they are called "unobtainiums" within the [[Extractive metallurgy|ore industry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1241872/EXCLUSIVE-Inside-Chinas-secret-toxic-unobtainium-mine.html
|title=EXCLUSIVE: Inside China's secret toxic unobtainium mine |publisher= [[Mail Online]] |date= 2010-01-10 |last=Jones |first=Richard |accessdate=2010-06-04 |quote= The rare-earths blasted out of rocks here [ [[Bayan Obo|Baiyun Obo]] ] feed more than 77 per cent of global demand... 'Dysprosium, for instance, allows systems to work under extreme conditions,' he explained. 'The US military doesn't want to buy it on the open market. They need a guaranteed supply and it's becoming a problem. }}
&lt;/ref&gt; and by commentators on the [[US Congress]]ional hearings into [[Plug-in electric vehicle#Rare earth metals availability and supply security|the "supply security" of rare-earths]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/03/congress-holds-hearings-on-unobtainium/ |title=Congress Holds Hearings on Unobtainium |publisher=[[wired (magazine)|wired.com]] |accessdate=2010-06-04 |last=Hodge |first=Nathan |quote=[[House Committee on Science and Technology|The House Committee on Science and Technology]]’s investigations and oversight panel is holding a hearing today on rare-earth metal supplies, focusing on [[China]]’s near-monopoly on the stuff. |date=2010-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kosich2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/3617/the-rare-earth-revolution-has-investors-stampeding-3617.html |title=The Rare Earth Revolution has investors stampeding |date=2010-01-13 |quote=Metals analyst Christopher Ecclestone suggests the hunt for Unobtainium storyline reminds him 'of some of the talk surrounding Rare Earths (REE) these days' |publisher=Mineweb |accessdate=2010-06-04 |last=Kosich |first=Dorothy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201135754/http://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/3617/the-rare-earth-revolution-has-investors-stampeding-3617.html |archive-date=2014-02-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''"Unobtainium"'' has come to be used as a synonym for "unobtainable" among people who are neither science fiction fans nor engineers to denote an object that actually exists, but which is very hard to obtain either because of high price (sometimes referred to as "unaffordium") or limited availability. It usually refers to a very [[high-end]] and desirable product; for instance, in the [[mountain biking]] [[community]], "These [[titanium]] hubs are unobtainium, man!" Old-car enthusiasts use "unobtainium" to describe parts that are vanishingly rare or no longer available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unobtainiumsupply.com/ |title=Unobtainium Supply Co. - When it's NLA, who do you call? |publisher=www.unobtainiumsupply.com |accessdate=2010-06-04 |quote=If you've been desperately searching for a part for your classic or [[Vintage car|vintage]] Ferrari, and have been hearing "IT'S NO LONGER AVAILABLE", or "IT CAN'T BE FIXED" }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.califspeed.com/index.cfm/fa/categories.main/parentcat/15775 |title=Parts "unobtainium" for sale - Rare auto and motorcycle parts |publisher=www.califspeed.com |accessdate=2010-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524133909/http://www.califspeed.com/index.cfm/fa/categories.main/parentcat/15775 |archive-date=2010-05-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In maintaining old equipment, ''unobtainium'' refers to replacement parts that are no longer made, such as parts for reel-to-reel audio-tape recorders or rare vacuum tubes that cost more than the equipment they are fitted to (especially true of certain vacuum tubes, such as the [[1L6]], used almost exclusively in [[United States|American]] battery-powered [[shortwave]] radios or the [[WD-11]] used in certain early 1920s radios). Similarly, parts for classic &amp; vintage Ferraris are made by a company actually named Unobtainium Supply Co.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unobtainiumsupply.com&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been repeated attempts to attribute the name to a real material. Because of the long-standing usage of the term "unobtainium" within the [[space elevator]] research community to describe a material with the necessary characteristics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Arnold |first1= James R. |last2= Thompson |first2= William B. |year=1992 |title=Advanced propulsion for LEO-Moon transport: II. Tether configurations in the LEO-Moon system: The Role of "Unobtainium" |publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute |page=57 |bibcode=1992lbsa.conf...55A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/elevator_update_020819.html |title='''Wanted: unobtainium''' Going Up? Private Group Begins Work on Space Elevator |accessdate=2010-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406030118/http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/elevator_update_020819.html |archivedate=2010-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LiftPort Group]] President Michael Laine has advocated assigning the term as the generic name for cables woven of [[carbon nanotube]] fibers, which seem to satisfy the requirements for this application. Since he claimed that sufficiently long nanotube cables will be prohibitively expensive to develop without inexpensive access to [[Microgravity environment|microgravity]], these cables would still be close enough to unobtainable to meet the definition. However, this usage does not seem to have become widespread. The eyewear and fashion wear company [[Oakley, Inc.]] also frequently denotes the material used for many of their eyeglass nosepieces and earpieces, which has the unusual property of increasing tackiness and thus grip when wet, as unobtanium.

Frequent Sunday night/Monday morning host of ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' [[George Knapp (journalist)|George Knapp]] usually opens his show mentioning unobtainium. As a play on the word, ''[[Obtainium]]'' is an album by [[Skeleton Key (band)|Skeleton Key]], released in 2002 by [[Ipecac Recordings]].

==Science fiction==
[[File:Unobtainium.PNG|thumb|A piece of the valuable ''unobtanium'' {{sic}} from ''Avatar''.]]
''Unobtainium'' can refer to any substance needed to build some device critical to the plot of a [[science fiction]] story but which does not exist in the universe as we know it. A hull material that gets stronger by absorbing and converting heat and pressure into energy in the film ''[[The Core]]'' (2003) was nicknamed ''unobtainium'', but the concept under different names can be seen in the anti-gravity material [[cavorite]] from H. G. Wells' 1901 novel ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]'', as well as the super-strong material [[scrith]] from [[Larry Niven]]'s novel ''[[Ringworld]]'', which requires a tensile strength (i.e. [[chemical bonds]]) on the order of the [[strong force|force]] binding an [[atomic nucleus]].

The term was used in [[James Cameron]]'s 2009 movie ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', as a substance that was named (in the film's dialog) ''unobtanium'' (note the slightly different spelling). In the film, it was mined on the fictional moon [[Fictional universe of Avatar|Pandora]] and was a [[room-temperature superconductor]].&lt;ref&gt;This property of Unobtanium is stated in movie guides, rather than in the film. {{cite book |last=Wilhelm |first=Maria |author2=Dirk Mathison |title=James Cameron's Avatar: A Confidential Report on the Biological and Social History of Pandora |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |date=November 2009 |page=4|isbn=0-06-189675-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Unobtainium'' can also refer to any rare but desirable material used to motivate a conflict over its possession, making it a [[MacGuffin]] (it appears in the story as something to obtain, not something that is significantly used).

''Unobtainium'' can be used in a disparaging context (e.g., "That idea is silly; you'd need unobtainium wires to hold the planet up!") or a hypothetical one ("If one were to build an unobtainium shell around a [[black hole]]'s [[event horizon]], what would happen to the material piling up on it?").

== Similar terms ==
The term '''handwavium''' (suggesting [[handwaving]]) is another term for this hypothetical material, as are '''buzzwordium''', '''impossibrium''', '''hardtofindium''', and less commonly, '''phlebotinum'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/narrative/v018/18.3.lang.html "The Status is Not Quo!": Pursuing Resolution in Web-Disseminated Serial Narrative] // Narrative Volume 18, Number 3, October 2010 
pp. 367-381 [[doi:10.1353/nar.2010.0002]]: "... Joss Whedon's work is such that there is an invented term—"phlebotinum"—which he and other writers employ when talking about devices they use to move the plot on which are incidental to the action."&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''eludium''' (also spelled with variants such as '''illudium''') has been used to describe a material which has ''eluded'' attempts to develop it.  This was mentioned in several [[Looney Tunes]] cartoons, where [[Marvin the Martian]] tried (unsuccessfully) to use his "Eludium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator" to blow up the Earth.

Another largely synonymous term is '''wishalloy''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4221/ch8.htm |title= NASA SP-4221: The Space Shuttle Decision – NASA's Search for a Reusable Space Vehicle |first=Thomas A. |last=Heppenheimer |year=1999 }} Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; although the sense is often subtly different in that a wishalloy usually does not exist at all, whereas unobtainium may merely be unavailable.

A similar conceptual material in [[alchemy]] is the [[philosopher's stone]], a mythical substance with the ability to turn [[lead]] into [[gold]], or bestow [[immortality]] and [[youth]].  While the search to find such a substance was not successful, it did lead to discovery of a new [[Chemical element|element]]: [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,690450-2,00.html "Experts Warn of Impending Phosphorus Crisis"], by Hilmar Schmundt, ''[[Der Spiegel|Spiegel]]'', 21 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Another closely related term is '''quantonium''' (a portmanteau of '''quantum''' and '''plutonium'''), the rare element that serves as the [[MacGuffin]] in the film [[Monsters vs Aliens]].

'''Uranyl nitrate''' ([[uranium|U]][[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;([[nitrogen|N]][[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a [[water]] [[soluble]] yellow [[uranium]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]. The yellow-green&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, D.E. and  Modise, T.S. (2007). Laser removal of loose uranium compound contamination from metal surfaces.  Applied Surface Science 253, 5258–5267.&lt;/ref&gt; [[crystal]]s of dioxouranium nitrate hexahydrate are [[triboluminescent]].

[[Uranyl]] nitrate can be prepared by reaction of uranium salts with [[nitric acid]]. It is soluble in [[water]], [[ethanol]], [[acetone]], and [[diethyl ether|ether]], but not in [[benzene]], [[toluene]], or [[chloroform]].

==Uses==
During the first half of the 19th century, many [[photosensitive]] metal salts had been identified as candidates for [[photographic process]]es, among them uranyl nitrate. The prints thus produced were alternately referred to as uranium prints, urbanities, or more commonly uranotypes.
The first uranium printing processes were invented by a Scotsman, J. Charles Burnett, between 1855 and 1857, and used this compound as the sensitive salt. Burnett, authored an 1858 article comparing "Printing by the Salts of the Uranic and Ferric Oxides"
The basis for the process lies in the ability of the uranyl ion to pick up two [[electron]]s and reduce to the lower [[oxidation state]] of uranium(IV) under [[ultraviolet]] light.
Uranotypes can vary from print to print from a more neutral, brown russet to strong Bartolozzi red, with a very long tone grade. Surviving prints are slightly [[radioactive]], a property which serves as a means of non-destructively identifying them.
Several other more elaborate photographic processes employing the compound sprang up and vanished throughout the second half of the century with names like Wothlytype, Mercuro-Uranotype and the Auro-Uranium process. Uranium papers were manufactured commercially at least until the end of the 19th century, vanishing in the face of the superior sensitivity and practical advantages of the [[silver halide]]s. Nevertheless, between the 1930s through the 1950s [[Kodak]] Books still described a uranium toner (Kodak T-9) using uranium nitrate hexahydrate. Some alternative process photographers including artists Blake Ferris and Robert Schramm continue to make uranotype prints today.

Along with [[uranyl acetate]] it is used as a [[negative stain]] for [[virus]]es in [[electron microscopy]]; in tissue samples it stabilizes [[nucleic acid]]s and [[cell membrane]]s.

Uranyl nitrate was used to fuel [[Aqueous Homogeneous Reactor]]s in the 1950s as an alternative to the more corrosive uranyl sulfate. However, research focus was on heterogeneous reactor designs and the experiments were abandoned{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

Uranyl nitrate is important for [[nuclear reprocessing]]; it is the compound of uranium that results from dissolving the decladded spent [[nuclear fuel]] rods or [[yellowcake]] in nitric acid, for further separation and preparation of [[uranium hexafluoride]] for [[isotope separation]] for preparing of [[enriched uranium]].

==Health and environmental issues==
Uranyl nitrate is an oxidizing and highly toxic compound. When ingested, it causes severe [[renal insufficiency]] and [[acute tubular necrosis]] and is a [[lymphocyte]] [[mitogen]]. Target organs include the [[kidney]]s, [[liver]], [[lungs]] and [[brain]]. It also represents a severe fire and explosion risk when heated or subjected to shock in contact with oxidizable substances.

The UK's targets are:

*By 2010 reduce biodegradable municipal waste landfilled to 75% of that produced in 1995
*By 2013 reduce biodegradable municipal waste landfilled to 50% of that produced in 1995
*By 2020 reduce biodegradable municipal waste landfilled to 35% of that produced in 1995

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3064">{{For|the professor of geoinformation|Werner Kuhn (scientist)}}
'''Werner Kuhn''' (February 6, 1899 – August 27, 1963) was a Swiss [[physical chemist]] who developed the first model of the [[viscosity]] of polymer solutions using [[statistical mechanics]].&lt;ref name="britannica" &gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9343561/Werner-Kuhn Werner Kuhn] - Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;  He is known for being the first to apply [[Boltzmann's entropy formula]]:&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, W. (1934). "Über die Gestalt fadenförmiger Moleküle in Losungen" (On the shape of filform molecules in solutions). Kolloidzeitschrift 68, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S = k \log W \!&lt;/math&gt;

to the modeling of [[rubber]] molecules, i.e. the "rubber band [[entropy]] model", [[molecule]]s which he imagined as chains of ''N'' independently oriented links of length ''b'' with an end-to-end distance of ''r''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Müller | first = Ingo | title = A History of Thermodynamics - the Doctrine of Energy and Entropy | publisher = Springer | year = 2007 | ISBN = 978-3-540-46226-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model, which resulted in the derivation of the thermal [[equation of state]] of rubber, has since been extrapolated to the [[entropic]] modeling of proteins and other conformational polymer chained molecules attached to a surface.

Kuhn received a degree in [[chemical engineering]] at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH, [[Federal Institute of Technology]]), in Zürich, and later a doctorate (1923) in [[physical chemistry]]. He was appointed professor of physical chemistry at the University of Kiel (1936–39) and then returned to Switzerland as director of the Physico-Chemical Institute of the [[University of Basel]] (1939–63), where he also served as rector (1955–56). &lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;

In a 1951 lecture along with his student V.B. Hargitay, he was the first to hypothesize the [[countercurrent exchange#Countercurrent multiplier|countercurrent multiplier]] mechanism in the mammalian kidney, later to be discovered in many other similar biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;A 2001 [http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/12/7/1566.full.pdf translation of the 1951 lecture originally published in German]. The translation was published with remarks by Professor Bart Hargitay, then one of Kuhn's two former student aids. Harbitay says: Before settling in Basel, Kuhn did some very fundamental work in Kiel, separating isotopes in a centrifuge. This caused him to be fascinated with the effect of countercurrents in multiplying a very small single effect to significant separations.

'''WindShare''' is a for-profit [[wind power]] [[Cooperative|co-operative]] that was officially launched in February 2002 in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada. It was created by the non-profit Toronto Renewable Energy Co-operative (TREC) which was incorporated in 1998. TREC continues to exist as a separate non-profit entity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trec.on.ca/about/aboutus.html website for Toronto Renewable Energy Co-operative (TREC) - About page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.windshare.ca/about/test.html |title=website for Windshare - history page |access-date=2010-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308110641/http://www.windshare.ca/about/test.html |archive-date=2010-03-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nowtoronto.com/lifestyle/ecoholic.cfm?content=171668|title=Taking T.O. off the grid |author=[[Adria Vasil]] |date= Oct 6–13, 2009|work= |publisher=[[Now (newspaper)|Now]] |accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hydro backs waterfront windmill plan |author=Brian McAndrew |work= |newspaper= [[Toronto Star]]|date=July 1, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Energy answer blowin' in the lakefront wind project|author=Karen Palmer |newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]]|date= July 1, 1999|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

WindShare's ExPlace [[wind turbine]] was erected on December 18, 2002, on the grounds of [[Exhibition Place]], in [[Toronto]]. It was the first [[wind turbine]] installed in a major North American urban city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.torontohydro.com/corporate/initiatives/green_power/wind_turbine/index.cfm|title= Canada's First Urban Wind Turbine - Not Your Average Windmill|accessdate=2008-04-11 |date= 2006-02-06|work= |publisher= [[Toronto Hydro]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080330064457/http://www.torontohydro.com/corporate/initiatives/green_power/wind_turbine/index.cfm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first community-owned [[wind power]] project in [[Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.windshare.ca/explace/the_wind_turbine.html |title=Explace turbine information on the Windshare website |access-date=2012-01-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103234226/http://www.windshare.ca/explace/the_wind_turbine.html |archive-date=2012-01-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{convert|91|m|ft|0|adj=on}} tall ExPlace wind turbine is co-owned by the ''WindShare'' [[Cooperative|co-operative]] and [[Toronto Hydro]], and annually adds an average of 1000 MWh of electricity to the city's main power grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.friendsofbruce.ca/Photos,Maps,Etc/Toronto_Wind_Energy_Co-op_Windmill.html|title= Toronto Wind Energy Co-op Windmill|accessdate=2008-04-11|work= |publisher=Bruce Centre for Energy Research and Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WindShare and its parent, the Toronto Renewable Energy Cooperative (TREC), have plans for more wind turbines. As of March, 2010 these plans are called "[[WindShare#Lakewind Project|The Lakewind Project]]." (See below)

==Lakewind Project==
{{Update section|date=September 2016}}
Lakewind Power Co-operative Inc. is a sustainable energy development entity consisting of two Ontario co-operatives: Countryside Energy Co-operative, and TREC-Windshare 2 Co-operative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ontario-sea.org/Storage/26/1774_A_Collaboration_of_two_Co-operatives_.pdf |title=Lakewind Power Co-operative Inc. - A Collaboration of two Co-operatives |access-date=2012-01-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304071652/http://www.ontario-sea.org/Storage/26/1774_A_Collaboration_of_two_Co-operatives_.pdf |archive-date=2012-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ontario Power Authority]]'s [[Feed-in tariff|Feed-In Tariff (FIT)]] program  is now in place as the most generous renewable energy support program in North America (See [[Green Energy Act 2009]], and [http://www.powerauthority.on.ca/sop/Page.asp?PageID=751&amp;SiteNodeID=250 Ontario Power Authority "Standard Offer Program" (SOP) for Wind Energy Projects] ).  TREC is moving ahead with ambitious generation development plans. Building on the experience from the WindShare co-operative's Exhibition Place wind turbine project, TREC has submitted a FIT contract application for a 20-megawatt (MW) wind farm project called Lakewind. TREC has incorporated Lakewind Power Co-operative Inc., a for-profit co-operative of Ontarians that will develop and own the project near the village of Bervie, just east of [[Kincardine, Ontario]]. The Lakewind project will be the largest co-operatively owned, wind power project in Canada and pending a successful FIT application, is expected to be generating power in the spring of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.windshare.ca/lakewind/index.html|title= The Lakewind Project|author= WindShare|date= |work= WindShare website|publisher= WindShare|accessdate= 9 March 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100306004538/http://www.windshare.ca/lakewind/index.html|archive-date= 6 March 2010|dead-url= yes|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If awarded a FIT contract, WindShare hoped to be looking for investors by the summer of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.windshare.ca/lakewind/index.html|title= The Lakewind Project|author= WindShare|date= |work= WindShare website|publisher= WindShare|accessdate= 9 March 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100306004538/http://www.windshare.ca/lakewind/index.html|archive-date= 6 March 2010|dead-url= yes|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ontario's feed-in tariff program==

{{See also|Green Energy Act 2009}}

[[Ontario]] introduced a [[feed-in tariff]] in 2006, and revised it in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerauthority.on.ca/SOP/Page.asp?PageID=122&amp;ContentID=6856&amp;SiteNodeID=412&amp;BL_ExpandID=190 RESOP Program Update]&lt;/ref&gt; which in a draft proposal increases from 42¢/kWh to 80.2¢/kWh for micro-scale (≤10&amp;nbsp;kW) grid-tied photovoltaic projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerauthority.on.ca/fit/Storage/30/10149_FIT_Price_Schedule_-_Draft_March_13__2009.pdf Proposed Feed-In Tariff Prices for Renewable Energy Projects in Ontario]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boell.de/climate-transatlantic/index-17.html Transatlantic Climate Policy Group] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311181935/http://www.boell.de/climate-transatlantic/index-17.html |date=2010-03-11 }}: [http://www.boell.de/climate-transatlantic/index-129.html Feed-in Tariffs in America: Driving the Economy with Renewable Energy Policy that Works] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718191209/http://www.boell.de/climate-transatlantic/index-129.html |date=2011-07-18 }}, accessed on April 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Ontario's FIT program also includes a tariff schedule for larger projects up to and including 10MW solar farms at a reduced rate.
