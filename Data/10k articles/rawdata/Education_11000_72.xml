The '''Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music''' ('''ABRSM''') is an examinations board and [[Charitable organization|registered charity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|292182}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in London, UK, which provides [[music examination|examinations in music]] at centres around the world. ABRSM is one of four examination boards accredited by [[Ofqual]] to award graded exams and diploma qualifications in music within the UK's [[National Qualifications Framework]] (along with the [[London College of Music Examinations|London College of Music]], Rockschool Ltd and [[Trinity College London]]). 'The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music' was established in 1889&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gb.abrsm.org/en/about-us/abrsm-history/ |title=ABRSM history |accessdate=18 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213235519/http://gb.abrsm.org/en/about-us/abrsm-history |archivedate=13 February 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rebrand]]ed as ABRSM in 2009.&lt;ref name=wayback/&gt; The clarifying [[strapline]] "the exam board of the Royal Schools of Music" was introduced in 2012.&lt;ref name=wayback&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abrsm.org |title=Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music |type=archived versions of website |publisher=Internet Archive |date=19 October 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717154627/http://www.abrsm.org/en/home |archivedate=17 July 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Schools referred to in ABRSM's title are:
* [[Royal Academy of Music|The Royal Academy of Music]]
* [[Royal College of Music|The Royal College of Music]]
* [[Royal Conservatoire of Scotland|The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland]]
* [[Royal Northern College of Music|The Royal Northern College of Music]]

More than 600,000 candidates take ABRSM exams each year in over 93 countries. ABRSM also provides a publishing house for music which produces syllabus booklets, sheet music and exam papers and runs professional development courses and seminars for teachers.

ABRSM is one of the UK's 200 largest charitable organisations ranked by annual expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charitiesdirect.com/CharitiesSearchTop500.asp?sortby=E Charities Direct: Top 500 Charities – Expenditure] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202024052/http://www.charitiesdirect.com/CharitiesSearchTop500.asp?sortby=E |date=2 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the year ended 31 January 2014, income was £42.9 million and expenditure was £39.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=292182&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|title=Charity Commission|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graded music exams==
Graded music exams provide a structured framework for progression from beginner to advanced musician. In the United Kingdom, ABRSM graded examinations are [[QCDA|QCA-accredited]] at three levels in the [[NQF|National Qualifications Framework]]:  Grades 1–3 at Level 1 (SQA: National 5, GCSE: Grades D–G), Grades 4–5 at Level 2 (SQA: Higher (G4) and Advanced Higher (G5), GCSE: grades A*–C)  and Grades 6–8 at Level 3 (SQA: Advanced Higher, GCE: A-Level).  Most subjects are offered from Grades 1–8 and have three standards of pass: a straight pass, a pass with merit and a pass with distinction. Candidates may enter any Practical or Music Theory exam grade without having taken any other, though there is a requirement to have passed Grade 5 Theory or Grade 5 Practical Musicianship or Grade 5 in a solo Jazz subject before Grade 6–8 Practical exams can be taken. Passes in Grades 6–8 in either Music Theory or Practical exams may be used as part of the [[UCAS Tariff|UCAS tariff]] in obtaining a university place in Britain. The four types of graded exam are as follows:

===Practical exams===
These are by far the most commonly taken exams. Available for over 35 instruments, these exams incorporate four individual components:
* '''Set pieces'''. The student is required to play three pieces prepared beforehand. These pieces are selected from the current syllabus for the instrument and grade, usually one piece from each of the groups A, B and C.  Group A usually features [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and early [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] repertoire, Group B late Classical and [[Romantic music|Romantic]], and Group C 20th century and contemporary music, encouraging the student to select a balanced programme with music in a range of styles and periods. For most instruments (obviously excluding the piano itself), some or all of the pieces are played with piano accompaniment. Each piece is marked out of 30. The pass mark is 20.
* '''Scales'''. Various [[musical scale|scales]], [[arpeggio]]s, [[Dominant 7th|dominant]] and [[Diminished seventh chord|diminished]] 7ths and, for Grades 1–4 only (Grades 1 &amp; 2 for Piano), [[broken chord]]s, are examined, according to the grade of difficulty. Scales are marked out of 21. The pass mark is 14.
* '''Sight reading'''. The student is presented with an unseen piece, has up to 30 seconds to prepare, and then must play to the best of his or her ability. Sight-reading is marked out of 21. The pass mark is 14.
* '''Aural'''. Various exercises are played by the examiner and the student is required to demonstrate skills in listening to and analysing music, for example clapping the rhythm or singing the [[melody]].  At higher grades, students are expected to comment on features of a short piece played by the examiner, including dynamics, phrasing and style and period. Aural is marked out of 18. The passing mark is 12.

The exams are marked out of 150, where 100 is a pass, 120 a pass with merit, and 130 a distinction.

===Music Theory exams===
Music Theory is examined through written papers. Papers last between one and a half and three hours depending on the grade. They are marked out of 100, where 66 is a pass, 80 a merit, and 90 a distinction.
Candidates are required to pass Grade 5 Theory, Grade 5 Practical Musicianship or Grade 5 in a solo Jazz subject in order to progress to Practical exams at Grades 6, 7 and 8.

===Practical Musicianship===
In a Practical Musicianship exam candidates demonstrate their understanding of melody, harmony, rhythm and form by responding to questions about music and by singing or playing an instrument of their choice in a series of tests. This exam is unaccredited and is used as an internal assessment prerequisite.

===Jazz exams===
Jazz exams (Grades 1–5) are available for a variety of instruments. They are marked in the same way as Practical exams. However, many of the pieces include large improvisational sections, where the instrumentalist is required to fill in the empty bars with their own melody to fit the standard chord progression listed above.

== Music Medals ==

[[Music Medals]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abrsm.org/musicmedals "Welcome to Music Medals!"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority|QCA]]–accredited music assessments and teaching resources aimed at younger, group-taught learners. Music Medals are distinct from graded music exams in that no external examiners are involved and the initial assessment is made by the teacher.

==ABRSM diploma, licentiate diploma and fellowship==
ABRSM offers diplomas in three disciplines:
*Music Performance
*Music Direction
*Instrumental/Vocal teaching

For each discipline there are four levels of award:

*DipABRSM (Diploma of The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music)
*ARSM (Associate of the Royal Schools of Music)
*LRSM (Licentiate of the Royal Schools of Music)
*FRSM (Fellowship of the Royal Schools of Music)
These are professional qualifications, and entitle the recipient to append the letters after his or her name.  The prerequisite for ARSM and DipABRSM is Grade 8 in the instrument offered, and LRSM and FRSM require the previous diploma in the same discipline to have been passed.  In addition, for the Instrumental/Vocal Teaching discipline, candidates for DipABRSM must have Grade 6 Theory, and Grade 8 Music Theory for LRSM.

===Music performance===
The examinations for DipABRSM, LRSM and FRSM are divided as follows: 
*Section 1: Recital
*Section 2: [[Oral exam|Viva Voce]] and Quick Study
Candidates perform various pieces from a selected list and may select works other than those listed but should not exceed one third of the entire recital programme. Recital time for DipABRSM is 35 minutes, ARSM is 30 minutes (performance only), LRSM is 40 minutes while for FRSM the time range is around 50 minutes.

Before the viva voce, the candidate must submit written programme notes on the day of the exam (for FRSM, the written submission should be submitted ''with'' the application form, in the form of an essay with in-depth analysis and requires sophisticated knowledge of the history, context of the composer as well as the era in which the works were composed) which should include background information as well as sufficient information and analysis of the works that are performed. The examiner(s) would engage in a conversation with the candidate concerning the notes submitted as well as other related questions that would allow the candidate to demonstrate his or her knowledge as a professional musician.

The Quick Study is a short piece with an equivalent difficulty of an ABRSM Grade 6 piece (for DipABRSM), an ABRSM Grade 7 piece (for LRSM) and an ABRSM Grade 8 piece (for FRSM). The candidate is required to sightread the piece and may be asked questions about the technical aspects and style of the selection.

===Instrumental/vocal teaching===
Candidates are expected to discuss their teaching materials and approach, and at LRSM must provide a video recording of their teaching. At DipABRSM candidates are assessed on their understanding of the principles of teaching up to Grade 5 level. At LRSM candidates are expected to demonstrate skills in teaching up to Grade 8 level, and for FRSM, up to DipABRSM level. The written submissions and Viva Voce are considerably longer than those for Music Performance. While there is no Recital section, candidates are expected to include demonstrations of passages in repertoire as part of their Viva Voce (e.g. candidates for FRSM Teaching are expected to be able to give authoritative demonstrations of sections of repertoire that are of a level to be performed in a DipABRSM exam). The Quick Study is the same as for the Performance diploma at the same level.

==Teacher training==
Since 1995, the CT ABRSM (Certificate of Teaching) designed specifically for music teachers has been offered in addition to the diplomas, albeit as a separate qualification. In 2010, the new CT ABRSM Plus, which combined the DipABRSM and old CT ABRSM, was launched to give teachers access to the DipABRSM. From September 2013, the CT ABRSM Plus stopped being offered in the UK or Singapore for financial reasons. The CT ABRSM Plus is now only offered in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CT ABRSM Plus |url=http://www.abrsm.org/en/teachers/courses/ukireland/ctabrsm/ctabrsmplusfirst/ |publisher=abrsm.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403032611/http://www.abrsm.org/en/teachers/courses/ukireland/ctabrsm/ctabrsmplusfirst/ |archivedate=3 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also numerous short courses and seminars on music teaching, accompaniment and syllabus instruction available to teachers.

==ABRSM publications==
ABRSM published its first books in 1918&lt;ref name="Libretto2014"/&gt; and its publishing department was first set up in 1921 and was designed to provide suitable music for examinations, performance editions of popular works and new instructional compositions. One of the original editors was Sir [[Donald Tovey]], who wrote informative notes on the music which are still highly regarded today. ABRSM (Publishing) Ltd. was established as a separate company in 1985.

ABRSM continues to produce copies of popular works, along with commentaries from distinguished editors. It publishes contemporary music in its "Spectrum" series of books, and also issues a variety of publications for beginners and younger instrumentalists such as the 'Time Pieces' books for a variety of instruments and 'Joining the Dots' for piano, guitar and violin players.

==ABRSM digital resources==
Since 2009 ABRSM has produced several practice applications to support teachers and students:

* Melody Writer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://melodywriter.org|accessdate=10 July 2014|title=Melody Writer|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205060816/http://melodywriter.org/|archive-date=5 December 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; - a tool designed to help improve melody writing and music theory knowledge and understanding
* Aural Trainer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gb.abrsm.org/en/exam-support/practice-tools-and-applications/aural-trainer|accessdate=10 July 2014|title=Aural Trainer}}&lt;/ref&gt; - an iPhone app that helps students practice their aural skills
* Speedshifter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gb.abrsm.org/en/exam-support/practice-tools-and-applications/speedshifter/|accessdate=10 July 2014|title=Speedshifter}}&lt;/ref&gt; - a practice tool that allows students to vary the speed of audio without altering the pitch
* Piano Practice Partner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gb.abrsm.org/en/exam-support/practice-tools-and-applications/piano-practice-partner/|accessdate=12 August 2014|title=Piano Practice Partner}}&lt;/ref&gt; - an app for iOS and Android devices that helps students practice exam pieces for piano at Grades 1 to 3. Piano Practice Partner plays one hand so that students can play the other as they learn.

==History==
The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music was founded in 1889 when [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], then the Principal of the [[Royal Academy of Music]], and [[George Grove]], founding Director of the [[Royal College of Music]], decided that both institutions should combine to form an associated examining board to run joint local exams. The first syllabi was published in 1890 for Piano, Organ, Violin, Cello and Harp, with Viola, Double Bass and woodwind instruments added the following year. Originally, the ABRSM had only two grades and were the equivalent of the current grades 6 and 7. Due to the popular demand for beginner grades, the present structure (grades 1-8) was introduced in 1933. In 1947, the [[Royal Manchester College of Music]] (merged to form the present [[Royal Northern College of Music]]) and Royal Scottish Academy of Music (now the [[Royal Conservatoire of Scotland]]) joined ABRSM. Since the post-[[World War II]] years, the ABRSM saw an increase in overseas exam applications. The curriculum also expanded, with the addition of [[Guitar]], [[Saxophone]] and [[Recorder (musical instrument)|Recorder]]. The 1990s saw percussion and jazz added to the syllabus. The current diploma exams were introduced in 2000,&lt;ref name="Libretto2014"&gt;{{cite journal|title=ABRSM through time|url=http://sg.abrsm.org/fileadmin/user_upload/PDFs/libretto0214_asia.pdf|journal=Libretto|publisher=ABRSM|date=2014|issue=2|pages=16-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as similar exams for instructors and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Feature: Professional Development for Teachers|url=http://www.musicteachers.co.uk/journal/2001-01_abrsm_3.html|publisher=musicteachers.co.uk|date=January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the ABRSM celebrated its 120th anniversary and of the 93 countries in which the association offers music examination support, they have been in Sri Lanka when it was known as Ceylon since 1898; in Malta from 1903; New Zealand (1908); Jamaica (1909); Barbados (1926); Antigua (1941); Kenya (1949); Hong Kong, Malaysia and Cyprus (1951); Brunei and Mauritius (1959); Switzerland (1961); Netherlands (1975); Indonesia (1977); Abu Dhabi (1981); Thailand (1982); USA and Canada (1986); Sweden (1988); Turkey and Portugal (1990); and Serbia (2006).

{{Accounting}}
An '''accountant''' is a practitioner of [[accounting]] or accountancy, which is the measurement, disclosure or provision of assurance about financial information that helps managers, investors, tax authorities and others make decisions about allocating resource(s).

In many jurisdictions, professional accounting bodies maintain standards of practice and evaluations for professionals. Accountants who have demonstrated competency through their professional associations' certification exams are certified to use titles such as [[Chartered Accountant]], [[Chartered Certified Accountant]] or [[Certified Public Accountant]]. Such professionals are granted certain responsibilities by statute, such as the ability to certify an organization's [[financial statement]]s, and may be held liable for professional misconduct. Non-qualified accountants may be employed by a qualified accountant, or may work independently without statutory privileges and obligations.

The [[Big Four (audit firms)|Big Four auditors]] are the largest employers of accountants worldwide. However, most accountants are employed in commerce, industry and the [[public sector]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, in 2009 in Ontario, Canada, national firms employ 4,425 [[Chartered Accountant]]s, which is less than 50% of the members in public practice. ([http://www.icao.on.ca/Institute/MemberDemographics/1009page4088.pdf Chartered Accountants in National Firms in Ontario, Canada] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706192237/http://www.icao.on.ca/Institute/MemberDemographics/1009page4088.pdf |date=July 6, 2011 }}) As total membership is 33,146, the national firms employ about 13% of all Chartered Accountants in Ontario.

Excepting the Association of Certified Public Accountants, each of the above bodies admits members only after passing examinations and undergoing a period of relevant work experience. Once admitted, members are expected to comply with ethical guidelines and gain appropriate professional experience.

Chartered, Chartered Certified, Chartered Public Finance, and International Accountants engaging in practice (i.e. selling services to the public rather than acting as an employee) must gain a "practising certificate" by meeting further requirements such as purchasing adequate insurance and undergoing inspections.

The ICAEW, ICAS, ICAI, ACCA and AAPA are five Recognised Supervisory Bodies ('''RSB''') in the UK. A member of one of them may also become a ''Statutory Auditor'' in accordance with the Companies Act, providing they can demonstrate the necessary professional ability in that area and submit to regular inspection. It is illegal for any individual or firm that is not a Statutory Auditor to perform a company audit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auditregister.org.uk/Forms/RSBList.aspx|title=Recognised Supervisory Body List|author=|date=|website=www.AuditRegister.org.uk|access-date=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/Conduct/Professional-oversight/Oversight-of-Audit.aspx|title=FRC|first=FRC web|last=team|date=|website=www.FRC.org.uk|access-date=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICAEW, ICAS, ICAI, ACCA, AIA and CIPFA are six recognised qualifying bodies statutory ('''RQB''') in the UK. A member of one of them may also become a ''Statutory Auditor'' in accordance with the Companies Act, providing they are a member of one of the five Recognised Supervisory Bodies '''RSB''' mentioned above.

All six RQBs are listed under EU mutual recognition directives to practise in 27 EU member states and individually entered into agreement with the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA).

Further restrictions apply to accountants who carry out insolvency work.

In addition to the bodies above, technical qualifications are offered by the [[Association of Accounting Technicians]], ACCA and AIA, which are respectively called AAT Technician, CAT ([[Certified Accounting Technician]]) and IAT (International Accounting Technician).

===Australia===
In Australia, there are three legally recognised local professional accounting bodies which all enjoy the same recognition and can be considered as "qualified accountant": the [[Institute of Public Accountants]] (IPA), [[CPA Australia]] (CPA) and the [[Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand]] (CAANZ). Other international bodies such as [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]] (The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) and [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] (ICAEW) enjoy recognition for the purposes of supporting their members in their careers. For instance, ACCA has achieved recognition by the Tax Practitioner Board, as Tax and BAS agents, in 2010.

===Bangladesh===
{{main|Accountancy profession in Bangladesh}}
Chartered accountancy is governed in Bangladesh by the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh]] (ICAB).

And The Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of Bangladesh (ICMAB) offers management accountant studies in Bangladesh.

===Canada===
In Canada, a '''[[Chartered Professional Accountant]] (CPA)''' must be a member of the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (designatory letters CPA).

Up to 2013, there were three nationally recognized accounting designations in Canada: Chartered Accountant (CA), [[Certified General Accountant]] (CGA), and Certified Management Accountants (CMA).  The national CA and CGA bodies were created by Acts of Parliament in 1902 and 1913 respectively, The national CMA organization was established under the Canada Corporations Act in 1920.

In January 2012, following eight months of member and stakeholder consultation, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA), the Society of Management Accountants of Canada (CMA Canada) and Certified General Accountants of Canada (CGA-Canada) issued ''A Framework for Uniting the Canadian Accounting Profession'' under a new Canadian Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) designation. Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada ([[CPA Canada]]) was established by CICA and CMA Canada on January 1, 2013, under the Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act, to support Canadian provincial accounting bodies that were unifying under the CPA banner. CGA-Canada integrated with CPA Canada on October 1, 2014, completing the unification of Canada’s accounting profession at the national level.

All recognized national and provincial accounting bodies in Canada have now unified under the CPA banner. The Canadian CPA designation is held by more than 200,000 members in Canada and around the world.

===India===

==Austria==
In Austria the accountancy profession is regulated by the Bilanzbuchhaltungsgesetz 2006 (BibuG – Management Accountancy Law).

==Hong Kong==
{{main|Accountancy in Hong Kong}}
{{about||the functional constituency|Accountancy (constituency)}}
In [[Hong Kong]], the accountancy industry is regulated by [[Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] [[HKICPA]] under the Professional Accountants Ordinance (Chapter 50, Laws of [[Hong Kong]]). The auditing industry for limited companies is regulated under the Companies Ordinance (Chapter 32, Laws of [[Hong Kong]]), and other ordinances such as the securities and futures ordinance, the listing rules, etc.

[[HKICPA]] terminated all recognition of oversea bodies in 2005 for ''accreditation'' under professional accountants ordinance. In general, all British RQBs except for CIPFA were re-accredited. Please refer to [[HKICPA]] for latest recognition.

==Portugal==
In Portugal, there are two accountancy qualifications: the ''Técnicos Oficiais de Contas'' (TOC), responsible for producing accounting and tax information, and the ''Revisor Oficial de Contas'' (ROC), more related to auditing practices. The TOC certification is exclusively awarded by the professional organization ''[[Ordem dos Técnicos Oficiais de Contas]]'' (OTOC), and the certification to become an auditor  is awarded by another professional organization, the ''Ordem dos Revisores Oficiais de Contas'' (OROC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oroc.pt|title=Ordem dos Revisores Oficiais de Contas|first=|last=Seara.com|date=|website=www.OROC.pt|access-date=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, accountants or auditors accredited by OTOC or OROC are individuals with [[university]] graduation diplomas in business management, economics, mathematics or law who, after further studies, applied for an exam and received the certification to be a TOC or ROC. That certification is only received after a one-year (TOC) or three-year (ROC) internship. Any citizen having a [[polytechnic (Portugal)|polytechnic]] degree as a [[Bookkeeping|bookkeeper]] is also entitled to apply for the exam and certification at the OTOC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.otoc.pt OTOC official site]&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{Further|Legal liability of certified public accountants}}
In the United States, licensed accountants are [[Certified Public Accountant]]s (CPAs), and in certain states, Public Accountants (PAs). Unlicensed accountants may be [[Certified Internal Auditor]]s (CIAs) and [[Certified Management Accountant]]s (CMAs). The difference between these certifications is primarily the legal status and the types of services provided, although individuals may earn more than one certification. Additionally, much accounting work is performed by uncertified individuals, who may be working under the supervision of a certified accountant. As noted above the majority of accountants work in the private sector or may offer their services without the need for certification.

The training time required for accountancy certification in the US requires specific guidelines:
* Certificate: Several months to a year
* Associate degree: 1–2 years
* Bachelor’s degree: 3–4 years
* CPA: 5 years of education (150 semester college credits) plus 1–2 years of work experience (length of work experience requirement depends on which state is granting the license)
* Master’s degree: 1–2 years
* Doctoral degree: 3–5 years

A CPA is licensed by a state to provide auditing services to the public. Many CPA firms also offer accounting, tax, litigation support, and other financial advisory services.  The requirements for receiving the CPA license vary from state to state, although the passage of the [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination]] is required by all states. This examination is designed and graded by the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]].

A PA (sometimes referred to as LPA—Licensed Public Accountant) is licensed by the state to practice accountancy to the same extent as are CPAs, although in some states PAs are not permitted to perform audits or reviews (notably Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon, &amp; South Carolina). A PA's ability to practice out of state is very limited due to most states having phased out the PA designation. While most states no longer accept new PA license applicants, four states still accept PA applicants for practice privileges within the state. As with the CPA, the requirements for receiving the PA license vary from state to state. Most states require a passage of either 2 or 3 (out of 4) sections of the CPA exam or passage of the Comprehensive Examination for Accreditation in Accounting which is administered and graded by the [[Accreditation Council for Accountancy and Taxation]] (ACAT).

A certified internal auditor (CIA) is granted a certificate from the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), provided that the candidate has passed a four-part examination. One of the four parts is waived if the candidate has already passed the CPA Exam. A CIA typically provides services directly to an employer rather than to the public.

A person holding the Certificate in Management Accounting (CMA) is granted the certificate by the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA), provided that the candidate has passed an examination of two parts and has met the practical experience requirement of the IMA. A CMA provides services directly to employers rather than to the public. A CMA can also provide services to the public, but to an extent much lesser than that of a CPA.

An [[Enrolled agent|Enrolled Agent]] (EA) is a [[Tax Advisor]], federally authorized tax practitioner empowered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to represent taxpayers before the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS). Enrolled agent status is the highest credential awarded by the IRS, unlimited rights of representation. &lt;ref&gt;Enrolled Agent Information, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, at [https://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Enrolled-Agents/Enrolled-Agent-Information].&lt;/ref&gt; The EA credential is recognized across all 50 [[U.S. states]]. Candidates must pass a three-part exam (called the [[Special Enrollment Examination]]) covering the subjects of individual tax, business tax, and client representation, or must have worked at the IRS for five consecutive years in a position which regularly engaged in these areas.

The [[United States Department of Labor]]'s [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] estimates that there are about one million persons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes132011.htm|title=Accountants and Auditors|author=|date=|website=www.BLS.gov|access-date=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; employed as accountants and auditors in the U.S.

[[Taxation in the United States|U.S. tax laws]] grant CPAs and EAs a form of [[accountant–client privilege]].

===Non-certified accountants===
{{Main article|List of accounting roles}}

==Japan==
In Japan, a certified public accountant must be a member of the Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (JICPA). It is the sole professional accountancy organization in Japan. The JICPA started as a voluntary organization in 1500s and later became a corporation under the CPA Act in 1700s.

The '''Anti-Hazing Act of 1995''', also known as '''Republic Act No. 8049''' is a national legislation in the [[Philippines]] regulating the act of [[hazing]] and other [[initiation rites]] in [[fraternities and sororities]] [[Fraternities and sororities in the Philippines|in the country]]. It prohibits and penalizes physical harm and violence in such practices.

==Background==
The Anti-Hazing Act was passed as a response to the death of Leonardo Villa in 1991. Villa died from multiple injuries when he underwent hazing rites by the [[Aquila Legis]], a fraternity of law students at the [[Ateneo de Manila University]]. Two decades later in 2012, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] found five members of the fraternity guilty of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide. The Anti-Hazing Act couldn't be applied to the five since it was still yet to be enacted as law when Villa died.&lt;ref name="scpunishes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Romero|first1=Purple|title=SC punishes 5 frat members for Lenny Villa's death|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/1658-sc-punishes-5-frat-members-for-lenny-villa-s-death|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=Rappler|date=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convictions==
By 2017, only 1 conviction has been made under the Anti-Hazing Act which was in 2015 when two [[Alpha Phi Omega (Philippines)|Alpha Phi Omega]] members were found guilty for the death of Marlon Villanueva, a [[University of the Philippines Los Baños]] student, in 2006&lt;ref name=years22&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cabico|first1=Gaea Katreena|title=Anti-hazing law: 22 years, 1 conviction|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/09/21/1740694/anti-hazing-law-22-years-1-conviction|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The Philippine Star|date=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed amendments==
Bills to amend the Anti-Hazing Act has been passed in both the Upper and Lower House. In 2016, Majority leader [[Tito Sotto]] passed Senate Bill 223 which aims to impose the maximum penalty for violators under the influence of alcohol and illegal drugs as well as if a non-resident or alumni fraternity member present during the hazing rites.&lt;ref name=years22/&gt;

Both [[Win Gatchalian]]'s Senate Bill 199 and Bagong Henerasyon party-list representative Bernadette Herrera-Dy's House Bill 3467 seeks to ban all forms of hazing, only allowing initiation rites which do not inflict physical or psychological harm. Gatchalian's bill also proposes to impose stiffer penalties and fine to non-resident and intoxicated members involved in hazing, additional fine if hazing results to death, mutilation, rape, and sodomy,
and requiring schools to conduct awareness campaign on hazing.&lt;ref name=years22/&gt;

'''Armenian Environmental Network (AEN)''', a project of [[Earth Island Institute]] (EII), is a [[non-profit organization]] headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]] [[United States]], with an office in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]]. AEN was founded in 2007 as a response to a lack of environmental information available to [[Armenians]] in the [[Diaspora]] on environmental problems in Armenia.

The Founder, Ursula Kazarian, and the Executive Director, Serda Ozbenian, are based in the United States. The Armenia office includes Armine Sargsyan, Armenia Office Director, and Armenuhi Nikoghosyan, Project Manager.

AEN serves a dual mission to: (1) Increase information sharing and distribution among Armenians in Armenia, the [[Armenian Diaspora]] and the wider conservation community; and (2) Facilitate partnerships through the responsible involvement of Diasporan and international resources to promote [[sustainable development]] in Armenia. This way, AEN is active in environmental problems in Armenia, and also creates a dialogue between Armenia and the Diaspora.

In Armenia, AEN focuses on [[waste management]] through project implementation and education programs. The [[Vardenis]] Environmental Education Initiative (VEEI), part of AEN's Waste Management Program,&lt;ref&gt;AEN's Integrated Waste Management Program&lt;/ref&gt; was implemented with the goal of bringing environmental education into the classroom.  Teachers of the Vardenis sub-region were trained on teaching methodologies, basic [[ecology]], and waste management using the AEN Teacher's Guide, specifically developed for use in rural Armenia. Other projects include constructing Armenia's first [[modern landfill]] in the city of [[Berd]]. AEN also holds Youth Forums, which are designed to inform Armenia's youth from regions outside of Yerevan on [[environmental issues]].

In the United States, AEN is working to expand its activities in cities with strong [[Armenian-American]] communities, with the hope to one day also expand to other Diasporan communities outside the U.S. AEN has organized environmental panel discussions in the U.S. since 2007, with topics ranging from [[deforestation]] and [[illegal logging]] to [[public health]], water and [[sanitation]], [[energy security]], and the role of transparency in environmental work.

The '''Association of University Administrators''' ('''AUA''') is the professional body for higher education administrators and managers in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland]]. The AUA exists to advance and promote the professional recognition and development of all who work in professional services roles in higher education, and to be an authoritative advocate and champion for the sector.

The AUA was formed from a merger of the Association of Polytechnic Administrators (APA) and the Conference of University Administrators (CUA). CUA traced its history back to the Meeting of University Academic Administrative Staff, founded in 1961. The AUA celebrated the golden jubilee of the professionalisation of support staff in UK universities in 2011.

==Aims==
AUA members are individually and collectively committed to:
* the continuous development of their own and others' professional knowledge, skills and practices;
* actively championing equality of educational and professional opportunity;
* the advancement of higher education through the robust application of professional knowledge, skills and practices;
* the highest standards of fair, ethical and transparent professional behaviour.

==Annual conference==
The AUA's annual conference is the largest professional development conference in the UK HE calendar, with plenary and keynote presentations and around 100 working sessions.  The 2011 Conference (in The AUA's Golden Jubilee Year) was held at the [[University of Nottingham]] 18–20 April 2011. The 2016 Conference was held in Leeds, at the [[Royal Armouries Museum]], 21–23 March 2016. The conference returns to Manchester from 10–11 April 2017 for the start of a three-year residency.

==Professional development==
The AUA provides professional development opportunities for university managers and administrators in the higher education sector. It provides opportunities to help members identify and meet their professional development needs through information services, events and conferences. The AUA organises an annual programme of seminars, workshops and conferences.

==CPD Framework==
The AUA has developed the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Framework to support the continuous professional development of all professional services staff working in the sector. The project was a culmination of a highly collaborative 2 year Leadership, Governance and Management (LGM) project, and was jointly funded by AUA, [[HEFCE]], [[Leadership Foundation for Higher Education|LFHE]] and the [[Higher Education Academy|HEA]]. The Framework is a significant milestone in the development of the profession of HE management and administration.

Since the Framework was formally launched at the [[AUA Conference and Exhibition]] 2009, The AUA has been working on plans to support implementation projects across the sector. By working with a small number of pre-pilot early adopting partners The AUA has established the extent to which the Framework can be adapted to a wide variety of organisational context.

The full CPD Framework document and supporting online resources are available for use by staff in HE.

==Postgraduate certificate==
The AUA Postgraduate Certificate in Professional Practice is a portfolio-based scheme validated by the [[Nottingham Trent University]].  Achievement of the award demonstrates a knowledge of key areas within the HE sector, transferable skills and evidence of the 'professional journey' undertaken.

==Themed networks==
The AUA has established a number of themed networks which allow members with similar interests to share good practice and develop their understanding of specific areas of HE policy and practice.

The AUA also have a number of established working groups which meet together to organise events or discuss key issues and exchange best practice, including the Planning Forum and the Equality Advisory Group.

==International==
The AUA has strong links with similar organisations and individuals worldwide. Members can also apply for Travel Awards of up £1,000 to undertake small research visits to countries outside of the UK and Ireland. In addition, The AUA organises an annual Study Tour, which involves a group of ten members of The AUA undertaking a two-week fact finding visit. Recent Study Tours have visited New Zealand, India, Brazil, and Japan. These and other international activities are organised by the [https://aua.ac.uk/connect/themed-networks/#InternationalHigherEducation International Higher Education Network], one of the specialist themed networks within The AUA, and co-funded by AHUA.

==Publications==
Members receive free of charge The AUA's quarterly journal, [https://web.archive.org/web/20111001061459/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/tpsp Perspectives]; quarterly newsletter, Newslink, and each new title in the Good Practice Guide series.

==Online==
The AUA's online services include a number of email discussion groups: aua-news, for electronic bulletins including weekly press digest and fortnightly professional development bulletin; and aua-forum, email list for sharing information and best practice. The AUA also has [[Jisc]] mailing lists, JISCmail, to aid communication within sub-groups of the organisation (e.g. aua-bc, aua-pgcert) and for special interest groups (e.g. aua-deptadmin).  It has an online jobs noticeboard.

==Chairs==
The senior official within AUA is the Chair of the Board of Trustees.

'''Chimie ParisTech''' (officially '''École nationale supérieure de chimie de Paris''' (''National Chemical Engineering Institute in Paris''), also known as '''ENSCP''' or '''Chimie Paris'''), founded in 1896 within the [[University of Paris]], is an [[Engineering education|engineering school]] and a constituent college of [[PSL Research University]] specialised in [[Chemistry|chemical science]]. It is located in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]].

The students enter the school after highly competitive exams known as the ''[[:fr:Concours Communs Polytechniques|Concours Communs Polytechniques]]'', following at least two years of ''[[classes préparatoires]]''. The school is known as France's most selective chemical engineering college&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccp.scei-concours.fr/sccp.php?page=cpge/statistique/statistique_accueil_cpge.html&amp;onglet=statistiques CCP : un concours pour écoles d'ingénieurs]. Ccp.scei-concours.fr (2013-09-16). Retrieved on 2014-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The school is a research center hosting ten laboratories which conduct high level research in various fields of chemistry.

==History==
The '''École nationale supérieure de chimie de Paris''' was founded in 1896 by [[Charles Friedel]], a chemist and mineralogist who headed the school until 1899. At the time, the school was called the '''Laboratoire de chimie pratique et industrielle'''. It was located in the [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]] (rue Michelet), where it stayed until 1923.

After the death of Friedel, [[Henri Moissan]] took the reins of the school. He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] for chemistry in 1906, while he was director. Moissan made student admission subject to competitive exams and renamed the school '''Institut de chimie appliquée''' (Institute of Applied Chemistry).

In 1907, the school began delivering a prestigious masters of engineering. In the same year, Moissan died and a transitional directorate was created. Soon thereafter, Camille Chabrié was named director. The school closed when [[World War I]] started and reopened in 1916. This was also the first year a female student was admitted; the ENSCP was one of the first engineering schools in France to do so.

In 1923, the school moved to its current location, on the rue Pierre et Marie Curie (in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th arrondissement]]). The buildings were designed and built by [[Henri-Paul Nénot]], architect of the [[Sorbonne]]. In 1932, the school became '''l'Institut de Chimie de Paris''' (Paris Institute of Chemistry). Finally, in 1948, it became the '''École nationale supérieure de chimie de Paris''' (ENSCP).

The '''Council for At-Risk Academics''' (CARA) is a charitable British organisation dedicated to assisting academics in immediate danger, those forced into exile, and many who choose to remain in their home countries despite the serious risks they face. Cara also supports higher education institutions whose continuing work is at risk or compromised. Cara offers academics support to continue their studies either by financially and logistically assisting scholars relocate to higher education institutions abroad or by assisting academics in their country of origin.

The organisation was founded in 1933 as the '''Academic Assistance Council''' (AAC), to assist academics who were forced to flee the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]]. In 1936 it was consolidated and renamed the '''Society for the Protection of Science and Learning''' (SPSL). In 1999 it was renamed the '''Council for Assisting Refugee Academics''' (CARA). It changed to its current name in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cara.ngo/who-we-are/our-history/|title=CARA: Our History|publisher=CARA|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charity is currently based on the premises of [[London Southbank University]] and continues to provide support to academics in danger.

==History==
[[File:Sir W.H. Beveridge, head-and-shoulders portrait, facing left.jpg|thumb|William Beveridge]] 
The Academic Assistance Council (AAC)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v158/n4003/abs/158092c0.html Society for the Protection of Science and Learning] ''Nature''&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in April 1933 by [[William Beveridge]]. Whilst en route to [[Vienna]] he learnt of the dismissal of a number of leading professors from German universities on racial and/or political grounds and was moved to launch a ‘rescue operation’ for the increasing numbers of displaced academics. On his return to Britain Beveridge set about enlisting the support of prominent academics.

By May 22, 1933, a founding statement&lt;ref&gt;http://cara.ngo/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Cara-Founding-Statement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; had been produced and it was circulated amongst British universities, politicians and philanthropists. This initial rallying call focused on the need for practical support, assistance escaping persecution and relocating in British universities, and deliberately avoided making any sort of political comment.

The council was formed of 41 men and women active in British intellectual activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2368638 | pmid=20777582 | volume=1 | title=ACADEMIC ASSISTANCE COUNCIL: AID FOR DISPLACED GREMAN PREFESSORS | journal=Br Med J | pages=974 |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.3778.974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and had as assistant secretary, the "redoubtable" [[Esther Simpson]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cara.ngo/who-we-are/our-history/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC Radio 4, "Miss Simpson's Children", broadcast 12 May 2017: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08pgm4b.&lt;/ref&gt; with office accommodation provided by [[The Royal Society]]. The Nobel Prize-winning chemist and physicist [[Ernest Rutherford|Lord Rutherford]] was chosen as the first President. [[Archibald Hill|A.V. Hill]], another Nobel Prize-winning scientist, and also Cambridge University MP, became Vice-President.The council included [[John Scott Haldane|J. S. Haldane]] and [[Frederick Gowland Hopkins|Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins]], [[Robert Strutt, 4th Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]], [[William Henry Bragg|Sir William Henry Bragg]].

In October 1933 ten thousand people attended an event at the [[Albert Hall]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; organised by several organisations including the AAC. [[Albert Einstein]], in his last major public address in Europe before his departure for the United State, spoke on the importance of Academic Freedom. In his address Einstein encouraged his audience to "resist the powers which threaten to suppress intellectual and individual freedom" and spoke of our duty to "care for what is eternal and highest amongst our possessions".

In 1936 the AAC changed its name to the Society for Protection of Science and Learning (SPSL). This change reflected the ideological development of the role of the organisation: from assisting individual academics, to the protection of academic freedom itself. Thousands of academics were helped by SPSL in the 1930s and 1940s. Sixteen academics assisted became [[Nobel Laureate]]s, eighteen were knighted and over a hundred were elected as Fellows of the [[British Academy]] or the [[Royal Society]]. Notably [[Ludwig Guttmann]] went on to found the [[Paralympic Games|Paralympics]]; [[Max Born]] was a pioneer of [[quantum mechanic]]s and one of the most prominent physicists to oppose the development of nuclear weapons; and [[Ernst Chain]] would be instrumental in the discovery of [[penicillin]].

The SPSL’s work continued past the end of the Second World War. Beveridge would later explain in his ''A Defence of Free Learning'' (1959) how "although Hitler was dead, intolerance was not" and "continued needs and the possible future crises" rendered the Society’s services as necessary as ever, in Europe and across the world.

In the 1940s and 1950s, the SPSL helped many academics seeking refuge from the Stalinist regimes in the USSR and Eastern Europe. As time passed, the SPSL’s focus expanded, to include, among others, those fleeing the [[apartheid]] regime in South Africa and juntas in Chile and Argentina. One of the most prominent South African exiles, whom the SPSL helped in 1966 and again in 1988, was the anti-apartheid leader [[Albie Sachs]], later a Justice in the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|South African Constitutional Court]] under [[Nelson Mandela]]. Sachs describes the "immense moral and emotional comfort" which SPSL’s assistance provided and he continues to be a supporter of the charity.

Since the 1990s SPSL’s focus has shifted to the Middle East, particularly Iraq and Iran, and to troubled regions of Africa. In 1999 SPSL was renamed Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara). In 2014 Cara was renamed again, but retained its acronym, becoming the Council for At-Risk Academics. This change reflected the fact that Cara helps many who are at great risk but do not see themselves as ‘refugees’, and instead still hope to return to their home countries when conditions allow.

== Prominent academics assisted by AAC/SPSL/Cara ==

Amongst the 1,500 academics assisted in the early years, sixteen went on to win [[Nobel Prize]]s, eighteen received Knighthoods, well over a hundred were elected as Fellows of the [[The Royal Society|Royal Society]] and of the [[The British Academy|British Academy]], and many more became leaders in their respective fields.

==Governance and Organisation==
Cara has a [https://web.archive.org/web/20120216170833/http://www.academic-refugees.org/council-of-management.asp Council of Management] of twenty-five, recruited predominantly from the world of academia. The Council of Management meets twice annually whilst the Council’s Finance &amp; General Purposes Committee meets at least quarterly.

Professor Sir [[Malcolm Grant]] CBE is the President of Cara. [[Anne Lonsdale]] is Chair of the Council and Professor Sir [[Deian Hopkin]] is Vice-Chair. The Executive Director, [[Stephen Wordsworth]], is charged with the day-to-day management of Cara and its staff.

==Current work ==
Cara runs several programmes.

The Fellowship Programme supports academics, often in immediate danger, to continue their work in safety. Cara works closely with the 112  universities in the Cara [[Scholars at Risk]] UK Universities Network, as well as other institutions in the UK and abroad, to secure placements for academics. Cara checks the applicants’ background, qualifications and references and negotiates the details of the higher education placement. Fee waivers and financial and in-kind support are secured by Cara, whilst any additional funding needed is allocated from the organisation's own resources. Cara assists in obtaining the appropriate visas for both the academic and, often, their families as well.

Many of the academics supported by Cara are committed to returning to their home country to rebuild their societies when conditions allow, employing the skills and connections they have obtained during their international academic placement. Cara also supports academics unable to return home because of continuing dangers by offering employment advice alongside training and education opportunities that enable academics to rebuild their careers in the UK.

Cara’s Country Programmes provide support to academics who are either working on in their country despite the risks or who have been forced into exile in the surrounding region.

The Iraq Programme was launched in late 2006 in response to a targeted campaign of assassination and kidnap. Over 350 Iraqi academics were murdered between 2003 and 2012, with thousands driven into exile or internally displaced. At the height of the Iraq Programme, over 75 academics from 16 UK universities and 11 Iraqi universities collaborated on research of direct relevance to Iraq. Research focused on issues as diverse as: the impact of depleted uranium-contaminated soils; bias in primary/secondary school curricula and texts; the development of child mental capacities in the absence of existing services; use of mobile phone technologies to enhance public health services; and the status of female academics post-2003. Cara's Iraq Programme sought to ensure skills and expertise in Iraq and the wider region were developed rather than lost.

The Zimbabwe Programme was launched in 2009 in response to a marked increase in the number of academics fleeing Zimbabwe, amid reports of a dramatic decline in the quality of higher education. The Programme offered grants and fellowships to pay for vital equipment and supplies, and in 2012 established a ‘Virtual Lecture Hall’ at the [[University of Zimbabwe]]. This enabled Zimbabwean academics in exile and others to connect in real time with the colleges and faculties of health and veterinary sciences, to plug knowledge gaps, to improve standards of teaching and research and to facilitate increased networking and collaboration. In response to demand, a second, mobile, system was provided in October 2013. The equipment has been formally handed over to the University of Zimbabwe, and continues to be in regular use, providing a long-lasting legacy

A '''divergent question''' is a [[question]] with no specific answer, but rather exercises one's ability to think broadly about a certain topic.

==In education==
Popular in [[inquiry education]], divergent questions allow students to explore different avenues and create many different variations and alternative answers or scenarios. Correctness may be based on logical projections, may be contextual, or arrived at through basic knowledge, conjecture, inference, projection, creation, intuition, or imagination. These types of questions often require students to analyze, synthesize, or evaluate a knowledge base and then project or predict different outcomes.

A simple example of a divergent question is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Write down as many different uses as you can think of for the following objects: (1) a brick, (2) a blanket.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Education in Mexico''' has a long history. The [[Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico]] was founded by royal decree in 1551, a few months after the [[National University of San Marcos]] in Lima. By comparison, [[Harvard College]], the oldest in Anglo-America, was founded in 1636.  Education in Mexico was until relatively recently largely confined to elite males and under the auspices of the [[History of Roman Catholicism in Mexico|Roman Catholic Church in Mexico]].

The Mexican state has been directly involved in education since the nineteenth century, promoting secular education.  Control of education was a source of ongoing conflict between the Mexican state and the Roman Catholic Church, which since the colonial era had exclusive charge of education.&lt;ref&gt;Pilar Gonzalbo Aizpuru, "Education: Colonial" in ''Encyclopedia or Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 434-438.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Escobar Ohmstede, "Education: 1821-1989" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 438-441.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Kay Vaughan, "Education: 1889-1940" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 441-445.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valentina Torres Septién, "Education: 1940-1996" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 445-449.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mid nineteenth-century Liberal Reform separated church and state, which had a direct impact on education.  President [[Benito Juárez]] sought the expansion of public schools. During the lengthy tenure of president [[Porfirio Díaz]], the expansion of education became a priority under a cabinet-level post held by [[Justo Sierra]]; Sierra also served President [[Francisco I. Madero]] in the early years of the [[Mexican Revolution]].

The [[1917 Constitution of Mexico|1917 Constitution]] strengthened the Mexican state's power in education, undermining the power of the Roman Catholic Church to shape the educational development of Mexicans. During presidency of [[Álvaro Obregón]] in the early 1920s, his Minister of Public Education [[José Vasconcelos]] implemented a massive expansion of access to public, secular education. This work was built on and expanded in the administration of [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] by [[Moisés Sáenz]]. In the 1930s, the Mexican government under [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] mandated socialist education in Mexico and there was considerable push back from the Roman Catholic Church as an institution.  Socialist education was repealed during the 1940s, with the administration of [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]]. A number of private universities have opened since the mid twentieth century.

Education in Mexico is currently regulated by the [[Secretariat of Public Education]] ({{lang-es|Secretaría de Educación Pública}}) ('''SEP'''). Education standards are set by this Ministry at all levels except in "autonomous" universities chartered by the government (e.g., [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]]). Accreditation of private schools is accomplished by a mandatory approval and registration with this institution. Religious instruction is prohibited in public schools; however, religious associations are free to maintain [[private school]]s, which receive no public funds.

In the same fashion as other education systems, education has identifiable stages: Primary School, Junior High School (or Secondary School), High School, Higher education, and Postgraduate education.

==Structure of the basic education system==
[[Image:Inukshuk Monterrey 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Students in [[Monterrey]], [[Nuevo León]]]]
In Mexico, basic education is normally divided in three steps: [[primary school]] (''primaria''), comprising grades 1-6; [[Middle school|junior high school]] (''secundaria''), comprising grades 7-9; and [[high school]] (''preparatoria''), comprising grades 10-12.

Depending on definitions, Primary education comprises ''primaria'' and ''secundaria'', which are compulsory by law, while Secondary education only includes ''preparatoria'', which was not compulsory a few years ago, but it has been made mandatory as well.

===Primary School===
The terms "Primary School" or "Elementary School" usually corresponds to ''primaria'', comprising grades 1-6, when the student's age is 6 to 12 years old. It starts the basic compulsory education system. These are the first years of schooling.

Depending on the school, a bilingual education may be offered from the beginning, where half the day instruction is in Spanish, and the rest is in a second language, for example, [[English language|English]] or [[French language|French]].

===Junior High School===
The terms "Junior High School" or "Middle School" usually correspond to ''secundaria'', comprising grades 7-9 when the student's age is 12 to 15 years old it is part of the basic compulsory education system, it follows primary school, and comes before  "high school" (''preparatoria'').

At this level, more specialized subjects may be taught such as Physics, Chemistry, and World History.
There is also the ''técnica'' which provides vocational training, and the ''telesecundaria'' which provides [[distance learning]].&lt;ref name="transition63"/&gt;

Despite the similarities of the words "Secondary school" and ''secundaria'', in Mexico the former is usually translated to ''preparatoria'', while in other countries, such as [[Puerto Rico]], or within the Spanish-speaking populations of the United States, the term ''secundaria'' refers to university.

===High School===
The terms "High School"&lt;ref&gt;United States&lt;/ref&gt; usually corresponds to ''preparatoria'' or ''bachillerato'', and follow "secundaria" comprising grades 10-12, when the student's age is 15 to 18 years old. Students may choose between two main kinds of high school programs: The SEP incorporated, and a University Incorporated one, depending on the state. Other minority of programs are available only for private schools, such as the [[International Baccalaureate]] which carries a completely different system. Nevertheless, in order to be taught, it must include a national subject at least. In addition, there are programs such as ''tecnología'' and ''comercio'' that prepare students for a particular vocational career.&lt;ref name="transition63"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mexico's Transition to a Knowledge-Based Economy: Challenges and Opportunities|page=63|first1=Yevgeny N.|last1=Kuznetsov|first2=Carl J.|last2=Dahlman|year=2008|publisher=[[World Bank Publications]]|isbn=978-0-8213-6921-0|doi=10.1596/978-0-8213-6921-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gq3pw2fE-vkC&amp;pg=PA63|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Preparatoria'' traditionally consists of three years of education, divided into six semesters, with the first semesters having a common curriculum, and the latter ones allowing some degree of specialization, either in physical sciences (physics, [[chemistry]], [[biology]], etc.) or social sciences ([[commerce]], [[philosophy]], [[law]], etc.). The term ''bachillerato'' is most commonly used for institutions that offer a three-year education program that "prepares" the student with general knowledge to continue studying at a university. In contrast, the term ''preparatioria'' is most often used for institutions that provide [[vocational school|vocational training]], in two or three years, so the graduate can get a job as a [[skilled worker]], for example, an assistant [[accountant]], a bilingual [[secretary]] or a [[technician]]. 

== Educational Integration ==
In 1993, educational integration was formally implemented nationwide through the reform article 41 of the General Education Law. This law mandates the integration of students with special needs into regular classrooms&lt;ref&gt;Diario Oficial de la Federación. (1993). ''Ley General de Educación'' retrieved August 10, 2018), from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.sep.gob.mx/work/models/sep1/Resource/b490561c-5c33-4254-ad1caad33765928a/07104.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Although formally, the term ‘educational integration’ is used, ‘inclusive education’ is often used to describe the educational system&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Fletcher, T., Dejud, C., Klingler, C., &amp; Lopez-Marisca, I. (2003) The changing paradigm of special education in Mexico: Voices from the field. ''Bilingual Research Journal, 27''(3), 409-430.&lt;/ref&gt;. Implementation of educational integration has taken many years and still continues face obstacles. Under the current model, students with severe disabilities that would not benefit from inclusion, study the same curriculum as regular classrooms in separate schools called Centros de Atencion Multiple [Multiple Attention Center], or CAM. Otherwise, special needs students are placed in regular classrooms and are supported by the Unidades de Servicio y Apoyo a la Educación Regular or the Unit of Support Services for Regular Education, (USAER). This group is made up of special education teachers, speech therapists, psychologists and other professionals to help special needs students in the classroom and minimize barriers to their learning.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, T., Dejud, C., Klingler, C., &amp; Lopez-Marisca, I. (2003) The changing paradigm of special education in Mexico: Voices from the field. ''Bilingual Research Journal, 27''(3), 409-430.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Challenges to Educational Integration ===
The combination of USAER professionals and regular teaching working in the same classroom has caused some issues for educational integration. Specifically, there is confusion about the roles of USAER professionals who work in regular classrooms. A study of USAER members found that regardless of urban or rural contexts, professionals had four common concerns. First, USAER professionals felt that they lacked preparation for working in the classroom. The second issue was feeling like their role had changed due to more demands being placed on them. The last two concerns were the lack of communication and collaboration between teachers and USAER professionals. Although the two work in the same classroom, they often work independently. However this creates problems when adjusting the curriculum for special needs students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Accessibility is another challenge for educational integration. Schools are required to have accessible buildings and classrooms, provide technical support and appropriate materials for special needs students&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Flores Barrera, V.J., &amp; García Cedillo, I. (2016) Apoyos que reciben estudiantes de secundaria con discapacidad en escuelas regulares: ¿Corresponden a lo que dicen las leyes? ''Revista Educación, 40''(2), 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt;. However, implementation of these features is inconsistent across schools. A case study of a student with visual impairment revealed that the school did not provide her with braille textbooks and her mother had to teach her the material.&lt;ref&gt;Palmeros y Avila, G.P., Perez-Castro, J., &amp; Quiroz Segura, M.L. (2017) Educational inclusion and development of strategies for learning a second language. The case study of a student with visual impairment.  ''International Journal of Humanities and Social Science, 7''(7), 162-170.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar case study found that the school was not equipped for students with sensory disabilities. The school lacked accessible furniture, handicapped restrooms or proper modification for students with sensory disabilities. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Finally, training for new teachers doesn’t provide them enough experience with special needs students, making the shift to educational integration difficult. A study of 286 pre-service teachers found that a third of didn’t have any experience working with special needs students. Additionally, 44% of the teachers reported having no formal training in working with this population.&lt;ref&gt;Forlin, C., García-Cedillo, I., Romero‐Contreras, S., Fletcher, T., &amp; Rodríguez-Hernández, H.J., (2010) Inclusion in Mexico: ensuring supportive attitudes by newly graduated teachers. ''International Journal of Inclusive Education, 14''(7), 723-739.&lt;/ref&gt; A qualitative study on pre-service teachers assessed their attitude towards special needs students and their self efficacy found that overall most teachers have positive perceptions of inclusive education. However, teachers with more hours of training, more experience, and better knowledge of policies had higher levels of confidence in working with students with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Romero-Contreras, S., Garcia-Cedillo, I., Forli, C., &amp; Lomelí-Hernández, K.A., (2013) Preparing teachers for inclusion in Mexico: How effective is this process? ''Journal of Education for Teaching'', ''39''(5), 509-522.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality of education in Mexico==
[[File:Biblioteca Vasconcelos, Ciudad de México, México, 2015-07-20, DD 04-06 HDR.JPG|thumb|Interior of [[Biblioteca Vasconcelos]], photo taken during [[Wikimania 2015]]]]
[[File:Biblioteca Vasconcelos, Ciudad de México, México, 2015-07-20, DD 19-20 HDR.JPG|thumb|left|[[Gabriel Orozco]]'s ''Ballena'' (''Whale'') in [[Biblioteca Vasconcelos]]]]
In recent years, the progression through Mexican education has come under much criticism. While over 90% of children in Mexico attend primary school, only 62% attend secondary school ("secundaria"). Only 45% finish high school ("preparatoria"). After secondary school, only a quarter pass on to higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Rama, A.

A program of education reform was enacted in February 2013 which provided for a shift in control of the education system from the teachers union [[Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación|SNTE]] and its political boss, [[Elba Esther Gordillo]], to the central and state governments. Education in Mexico had been controlled by the teachers union and its leaders for many years.&lt;ref name="BBC022613"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mexico's Peña Nieto enacts major education reform|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-21582629|accessdate=June 16, 2016|work=BBC|date=26 February 2013|quote=The law foresees a centralised process for hiring, evaluating, promoting and retaining teachers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter Gordillo was arrested on racketeering charges.&lt;ref name="BBC022813"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mexico union head Gordillo charged with organised crime|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-21597680|accessdate=June 16, 2016|work=BBC|date=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016 the government continued to struggle with the union and its offshoot, [[Coordinadora Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación|CNTE]].&lt;ref name="WSJ61216"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Juan Montes|title=Mexico Detains Leader of Dissident Teachers Group in Oaxaca State Rubén Núñez arrested on charges of using illegally obtained funds, Attorney General’s Office says|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/mexico-detains-leader-of-dissident-teachers-group-in-oaxaca-state-1465780259|accessdate=June 16, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Higher education==
{{see also|List of universities in Mexico}}
[[File:UNAM Ciudad Universitaria.jpg|right|thumb|250 px|[[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]] ''The main campus of this public university in [[Mexico City]].]]
[[File:IBERO.JPG|right|thumb|250px|[[Universidad Iberoamericana]], a private institution founded in the early 1940s]]

There are both public and private institutions of higher education. Higher education usually follows the [[Higher education in the United States|US education model]] with an at least 4-year bachelor's degree undergraduate level (''Licenciatura''), and two degrees at the postgraduate level, a 2-year [[Master's degree]] (''Maestría''), and a 3-year [[Doctoral degree]] (''Doctorado''), followed by the [[higher doctorate]] of [[Doctor of Sciences]] (''Doctor en Ciencias''). 
This structure of education very closely conforms to the [[Bologna Process]] started in [[Europe]] in 1999, allowing Mexican students to study abroad and pursue a master's degree after ''Licenciatura'', or a Doctoral degree after ''Maestría''. 
&lt;!--
Regarding the type of school, four kinds of institutes can generally be identified:{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
# Universities, offering 4-5 year degrees.
# Technical institutes, offering 3-year programs in engineering and management.
# Teacher-training colleges, offering bachelor's degrees in the fields of education.
# Technological universities, offering two-year programs to prepare students as Higher University Technicians, which later can decide to complete a full engineering degree.
--&gt;
Unlike other [[OECD]] countries, the majority of Mexico's public universities do not accredit part-time enrollment programs.{{sfn|Kuznetsov|Dahlman|2008|p=72}}{{sfn|Kuznetsov|Dahlman|2008|p=81}}

===Undergraduate studies===
Undergraduate studies normally last at least 4 years, divided into [[semester]]s or [[Academic quarter (year division)|quarter]]s, depending on the college or university, and lead to a bachelor's degree (''Licenciatura''). According to OECD reports, 23% of Mexicans aged 23–35 have a college degree.

Although in theory every graduate of a ''Licenciatura'' is a Licenciate (''Licenciado'', abbreviated ''Lic.'') of his or her profession, it is common to use different titles for common professions such as Engineering and Architecture.
* Engineer, ''Ingeniero'', abbreviated ''Ing.''
**Electrical Engineer, ''Ingeniero Eléctrico''
**Electronics Engineer, ''Ingeniero Electrónico''
**Mechanical Engineer, ''Ingeniero Mecánico''
**Computer Systems Engineer, ''Ingeniero en Sistemas Computacionales'', abbreviated ''I.S.C.''
* Architect, ''Arquitecto'', abbreviated ''Arq.''
* Licenciate, any degree, especially those from social sciences, ''Licenciado'', abbreviated ''Lic.''

===Postgraduate studies===
New regulations since 2005 divide postgraduate studies at Mexican universities and research centers in two main categories:&lt;ref name="Posgrado DGEST"&gt;{{cite book |title= Disposiciones para la Operación de Estudios de Posgrado en el Sistema Nacional de Educación Superior Tecnológica |first1=Reyes |last1=Tamez Guerra |first2=Julio |last2=Rubio Oca |first3=Bulmaro |last3=Fuentes Lemus |first4=Mario |last4=Valdés Garza |date=May 2005 |publisher=Dirección General de Educación Superior Tecnológica |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Targeted at professional development
** ''Especialización''. A 1-year course after a bachelor's degree (''Licenciatura''), which awards a Specialization Diploma (''Diploma de Especialización'').
** ''Maestría''. A 2-year degree after a bachelor's degree (''Licenciatura''), which awards the title of Master (''Maestro'').
Targeted at scientific research
* ''Maestría en Ciencias''. A 2-year degree after a bachelor's degree (''Licenciatura''), which awards the title of Master of Science (''Maestro en Ciencias'').
* ''Doctorado''. A 3-year degree after a master's degree (either ''Maestría'' or ''Maestría en Ciencias''), or a 4-year degree directly after the bachelor's degree (''Licenciatura'') for high-achieving students. The [[Doctor of Sciences]] degree (''Doctor en Ciencias'') is equivalent to the [[higher doctorate]] awarded in countries such as [[Denmark]], [[Ireland]], the [[UK]], and the former [[USSR]] countries.

=== Intercultural Universities ===
[[Intercultural Universities in Mexico]] were established in 2004 in response to the lack of enrollment of the [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous population]] in the country. While an estimated 10% of the population of [[Mexico]] is indigenous, it is the least represented in higher education. According to estimates, only between 1% and 3% of [[higher education]] enrollment in Mexico is indigenous. In response to this inequality, the General Coordination for Intercultural and Bilingual Education at the Ministry of Education established Intercultural Universities with the active participation of indigenous organizations and academic institutions in each region.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/FIELD/Cairo/images/RethinkingEducation.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International education==
As of January 2015, the International Schools Consultancy (ISC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iscresearch.com/|title=Home - International School Consultancy|website=www.iscresearch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; listed Mexico as having 151 international schools.&lt;ref name="iscresearch.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000123/http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ISC defines an 'international school' in the following terms "ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country’s national curriculum and is international in its orientation."&lt;ref name="iscresearch.com"/&gt; This definition is used by publications including [[The Economist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21636757-english-language-schools-once-aimed-expatriates-now-cater-domestic-elites-new|title=The new local|website=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In central Mexico, the history of education stretches back to the prehispanic era, with the education of Nahuas in schools for elites and commoners.  A formal system of writing was created in various parts of central and southern Mexico, with trained experts in its practice.  After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], friars embarked on a widespread program of evangelization of Christianity. In the colonial era, schooling of elite men of European descent was established under the auspices of the Catholic Church.  Liberals' attempts to separate church and state in post-independence Mexico included removal of the Catholic Church from education.  Education remains an important aspect of Mexican institutional and cultural life, and conflicts continue about how it should be conducted. The history of education in Mexico gives insight into the larger history of the nation.

==Education in Mesoamerica Before the Spanish==
[[File:Codex Mendoza folio 61r.jpg|thumb|right|[[Codex Mendoza]], Folio 61 recto&lt;br&gt;''(top)'' Formal education of 15-year-old Aztec boys trained for the military or the priesthood.&lt;br&gt;''(bottom)'' A 15-year-old girl gets married.]]

In central Mexico in the cultural area known as [[Mesoamerica]], the [[Aztecs]] set up schools called [[calmecac]] for the training of warriors and schools for the training of priests, called ''cuicacalli''. An early post-conquest manuscript prepared by native scribes for the viceroy of Mexico, [[Codex Mendoza]] shows these two types of schools. Aztec religion was highly complex and priests held a higher status, so that the creation of schools to train them in ritual and other aspects of religion was important. Overseeing an expansionist empire, Aztec rulers needed trained warriors, so that the creation of formal schools for their training was as important.

==Colonial-era education, 1521-1821==

===Education of the Indigenous in Central Mexico===
The Spanish Crown made a significant commitment to education in colonial [[New Spain]].  The first efforts of schooling in Mexico were friars’ evangelization of indigenous populations. “Educating the native population was a crucial justification of the colonizing enterprise, and that ''criollo'' (Spanish American) culture was encouraged as a vehicle for integrating” the indigenous.&lt;ref&gt;Pilar Gonzalbo Aizpuru, “Education: Colonial” in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt;   Fray [[Pedro de Gante]] established schools for indigenous in the immediate post-conquest years and produced pictorial texts to teach Catholic doctrine.  All the mendicant orders in Mexico, the Franciscans, Dominicans, and Augustinians, built churches in large indigenous communities as places of worship and to teach the catechism, so that large outdoor atriums functioned as classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Aizpuru, “Education: Colonial,” p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt; Elite indigenous lads were tapped for training as catechists and helpers to the priests, whose small numbers could in no way minister to large numbers of ordinary indigenous.

In 1536, the Franciscans and the Spanish crown established a school to train an indigenous Catholic priesthood, the [[Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco]], which was deemed a failure in its goal of training priests, but did create a small cohort of indigenous men who were literate in their native language of [[Nahuatl]], as well as Spanish and Latin.  The Franciscans also founded the school of San José de los Naturales in Mexico City, which taught trades and crafts to boys. The [[Colegio de San Gregorio]] was also founded for the education of indigenous elites, the most famous of whom was [[Chimalpahin]], (also known as Don Domingo Francisco de San Antón Muñón Chimalpahin Quauhtlehuanitzin).

Religious orders, particularly the Franciscans, taught indigenous scribes in central Mexico to be literate in their own languages, allowing the creation of documents at the local level for colonial officials and communities to enable crown administration as well as production of last will and testaments, petitions to the crown, bills of sale, censuses and other types of legal record to be produced at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Karttunen, “Nahuatl Literacy” in ''The Inca and Aztec States'', New York:  Academic Press,&lt;/ref&gt;  The large number of indigenous language documents found in the archives in Mexico and elsewhere have enabled scholars of the [[New Philology]]  to analyze life of Mexico’s colonial-era indigenous from indigenous perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest''.  Stanford: Stanford University Press 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education of Elite Creole Men===
The [[Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico ]] was founded in September 1551 at the request by Mexico’s first viceroy, Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]]  to the Spanish crown.  The university was located in the central core (''traza'') of [[Mexico City|History of Mexico City]].  Its first rector, [[Francisco Cervantes de Salazar]], wrote an account of the university.  The institution initially trained in priests, lawyers, and starting in 1579, medical doctors.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Eugenia Rodríguez, “Escuela Nacional de Medicina,” in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 458.&lt;/ref&gt;  These were the traditional disciplines of the medieval and early modern eras.  The Royal and Pontifical University was the sole institution that could confer academic degrees.  With the title of royal and pontifical university, its degrees were titled the same as European degrees.&lt;ref name="Aizpuru, p. 436"&gt;Aizpuru, “Education: Colonial,” p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Jesuits]] arrived in Mexico in 1571 and rapidly founded schools and colegios, and sought to confer degrees; however, the [[Council of the Indies]], the royal entity overseeing the Spanish overseas empire, decided against them.&lt;ref name="Aizpuru, p. 436"/&gt;

The university retained its premier position. One of its best known graduates was Don [[Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora]], a Mexican savant of the seventeenth century, who was a friend of Sor [[Juana Inés de la Cruz]], a cloistered nun and intellectual, famous in her lifetime as the “Tenth Muse.”   Sor Juana was barred from attending the university due to her gender.

[[File:José Jiménez - Interior of the Metropolitan Cathedral Choir School - Google Art Project.jpg|250px|thumbnail|''Interior del Colegio de Infantes de la Catedral de México'', José Jiménez, 1857. [[Museo Nacional de Arte]].]]
In general, educational institutions were urban-based, with the capital Mexico City having the largest concentration.  However, there were seminaries to train priests in provincial cities, such as the Colegio de San Nicolás, founded by Bishop [[Vasco de Quiroga]] in the city now called [[Morelia]]. Insurgent leader Father [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] served as rector there until he was relieved of his position. One of his students was insurgent leader Father [[José María Morelos]].  Educated priests were prominent in the movement toward independence from Spain.

===Education of Girls and Mixed-Race Children===
Most of the Mexican population was illiterate and entirely unschooled, and there was no priority for education of girls.&lt;ref&gt;Lino Gómez Canedo, ''La educación de los marginados durante la época colonial'',"cap. III. "Casas de recogimiento y de educación para niñas indias," Mexico: Porrúa 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;  A few girls in cities attended schools run by cloistered nuns. Some entered convent schools at around age eight, “to remain cloistered for the rest of their lives.”&lt;ref&gt;Aizpuru, “Education: Colonial,” p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt; There were some schools connected to orphanages or confraternities. Private tutors educated girls from wealthy families, but only enough so that they could oversee a household.  There were few opportunities for mixed race boys or girls. “Education was, in short, highly selective as befits a stratified society, and the possibilities of self-realization were a lottery of birth rather than talent.”&lt;ref&gt;Aizpuru, “Education: Colonial,” p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Independence Era, 1821-present==
[[File:ENPlogo.jpg|thumb|left|Logo of the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria]], founded in 1868.]]
[[File:Escudo-UNAM-escalable.svg|thumb|right|Logo of the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]]]]

When [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] put his Liberal vice president [[Valentín Gómez Farías]] in charge of running the government, the vice president created in 1833 a public education system. This preceded the establishment of a Ministry of Public Education.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Andrade de Herrara, "Education in Mexico: Historical and Contemporary Educational Systems" in ''Children of La Frontera: Binational Efforts to Serve Mexican Migrant and Immigrant Students'', Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), 1996, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; This reform was short lived, but with the Liberal Reform in the mid-nineteenth century, a [[normal school]] for teacher training was established.&lt;ref&gt;Andrade de Herrrara, "Education in Mexico", p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberals push for public education awaited the end of the [[War of the Reform]] and the ousting of the French Empire in Mexico (1862–67).  The restored republic of President [[Benito Juárez]] reaffirmed the liberal principles separation of church and state, which in the educational sphere meant supplanting the Catholic Church by the Mexican state.  Primary education in Mexico was henceforth to be secular, free of fees and tuition, and obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;Andrade de Herrara, "Education in Mexico", p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

A key figure in higher education in Mexico was [[Gabino Barreda]], who chaired Juárez's commission on education in 1867.&lt;ref name="Charles A. Hale 1989, p. 140"&gt;Charles A. Hale, ''The Transformation of Liberalism in Late Nineteenth-Century Mexico''. Princeton: Princeton University Press 1989, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Barreda was a follower of French intellectual [[Auguste Comte]] who established [[positivism]] the dominant philosophical school in the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Delmez, "The Positivist Philosophy in Mexican Education, 1867-1873," ''The Americas'' vol. 6, no. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The Juárez government created a system of secondary education, and a key institution was the [[National Preparatory School]] ('''Escuela Nacional Preparatoria'''), founded in 1868 in Mexico City, which Barreda directed.&lt;ref name="Charles A. Hale 1989, p. 140"/&gt;  Education at the Preparatoria was uniform for all students and "designed to fill what José Díaz Covarrubias identified as the traditional void between primary and professional training."&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''The Transformation of Liberalism'', p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, the government of [[Porfirio Díaz]] under the minister of education [[Justo Sierra]] established the secular, state-controlled Universidad Nacional de México. The [[Pontifical University of Mexico]] under religious authority was suppressed in 1865.

The government expanded [[normal schools]] after the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1910.&lt;ref name="Agren 4A"&gt;{{Cite news | first=David | last=Agren | title='Normalistas' fight changes in Mexico education system | url=http://www.floridatoday.com/usatoday/article/1748405 | newspaper=[[Florida Today]] | location=Melbourne, Florida | pages= 4A | date=December 10, 2012 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---hard copy source different from soft copy but is the identical article---&gt;

The 1960 national census illustrates the historically poor performance of the Mexican educational system. The 1960 census found that as to all Mexicans over the age of five, 43.7% had not completed one year of school, 50.7% had completed six years or less of school, and only 5.6% had continued their education beyond six years of school.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Alba, ''The Population of Mexico: Trends, Issues, and Policies'' (New Brunswick: Transaction Books, 1982), 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, Mexico had only three million students enrolled in education. Today, there are 32 million enrolled students.&lt;ref&gt;Rama, A. (2011, April 13). “Factbox: Facts about Mexico's education system.” Retrieved November 17, 2014, from https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/13/us- mexico-education-factbox-idUSTRE73C4UY20110413!&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, some teachers from rural areas, specifically, from [[Michoacan]] and [[Guerrero]] states, opposed federal regulations which prevented them from automatic [[lifetime tenure]], the ability to sell or will their jobs, and the teaching of either English or computer skills.&lt;ref name="Agren 4A"/&gt;&lt;!---hard copy source different from soft copy but is the identical article---&gt;

In 2015, 96.2% of six to fourteen year-olds attended school, up from 91.3% in 2000.&lt;ref name="Encuesta Intercensal 2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Principales resultados de la Encuesta Intercensal 2015 Estados Unidos Mexicanos |url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/est/contenidos/proyectos/encuestas/hogares/especiales/ei2015/doc/eic2015_resultados.pdf |publisher=[[INEGI]] |accessdate=9 December 2015 |pages=28–32 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210212235/http://www.inegi.org.mx/est/contenidos/proyectos/encuestas/hogares/especiales/ei2015/doc/eic2015_resultados.pdf |archivedate=10 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The state with the highest attendance rate was [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]] (97.8%) and the state with the lowest attendance rate was [[Chiapas]] (93%).&lt;ref name="Encuesta Intercensal 2015"/&gt;  In the same year, 63% of three to five year-olds attended preschool or kindergarten, up from 52.3% in 2010.&lt;ref name="Encuesta Intercensal 2015"/&gt; Also in 2015, 44% of 15 to 24 year-olds attended secondary or tertiary school, an increase from 32.8% in 2000.&lt;ref name="Encuesta Intercensal 2015"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6898">'''Floor hockey''' is a family of indoor [[hockey]] games. 5 variations exist: three variations in the style of [[ice hockey]], and the other two in the style of [[bandy]], one of which is called [[floorball]] in English speaking regions.
Two of these variations involve the use of wheeled skates and are categorized as [[roller sports]] under the title of [[roller hockey]]. [[Quad hockey]] uses [[quad skates]] and looks similar to bandy, while [[inline hockey]] uses [[inline skates]] and is of the ice hockey variation.
All styles and codes are played on dry, flat floor surfaces such as a gymnasium or basketball court. As in other hockey codes, players on each team attempt to shoot a ball or puck into a goal using sticks, usually with a
curved end.&lt;ref&gt;“Floor Hockey Rules,” http://sportsvite.com/sports/FloorHockey/rules{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Floor hockey games differ from [[street hockey]] in that the games are more structured, and two use wheeled skates. The variations which do not involve wheeled skates are sometimes used for training children to play ice hockey&lt;ref name=encyclo&gt;{{cite book|page=158|chapter=floor hockey|title=Webster's Sports Dictionary|publisher=G&amp;G Merriam Company|year=1976|location=Springfield, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bandy in a training format known as [[dryland training]].

==History==
Floor hockey codes derived from ice hockey were first officially played in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada in 1875, but the game's official creation is credited to [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]] inductee, [[Samuel Perry Jacks]], better known as "Sam Jacks".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportshall.ca/stories.html?proID=491&amp;catID=all&lt;/ref&gt; Jacks is the individual credited with both the creation of the official skateless game derived from ice hockey and codifying its first set of rules in 1936. At the time, Jacks was working as assistant physical director at the West End YMCA in [[Toronto]]. His achievement was later recognized by the [[United Nations]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Floor hockey is a physical fitness sport in many public schools for physical education class.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Academic Edition, s.v. “Ice Hockey”&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of [[ringette]] was introduced as a sport in the Winter [[Special Olympics]] in 1932.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} In 1970, the [[Special Olympics]] added team floor hockey as an event, with the distinction of it being the only team sport under its purview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Floor Hockey: Sport History|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322110631/http://www.specialolympicspa.org/sportslive/FloorHockey.php|archive-date=March 22, 2012|url=http://www.specialolympicspa.org/sportslive/FloorHockey.php|publisher= Special Olympics – Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Ball Hockey Association]] (CBHA) was formed in 1991 to provide more formal leagues of ball-based floor hockey.&lt;ref&gt;“Canadian Ball Hockey Association History,” The Canadian Ball Hockey Association, http://cbha.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=2&lt;/ref&gt;  The CBHA runs leagues for men, women, and juniors, and organizes National Championships for each division.&lt;ref&gt;“CBHA Who We Are”, The Canadian Ball Hockey Association, http://cbha.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association Hockey Committee released a baseline set of rules for intramural floor hockey for college campuses across the United States.

==Equipment==

Floor hockey equipment differs between each code. Some codes use an indoor [[Puck (sports)|puck]], a ring made of felt or other material ( [[Gym Ringette]] ) while others use a lightweight plastic ball, or a heavier ball. Some codes require standard [[ice hockey]], field hockey or [[bandy]] sticks, while others use lightweight plastic. In gym ringette plastic bladeless sticks are used while the Special Olympics version of floor hockey uses wooden ones. The types of checking and protective equipment allowed also vary.

==Variations==

One variation, especially popular in [[Europe]], is [[floorball]]. Floorball uses a lightweight plastic ball and sticks made of plastic and carbon fiber. Limited checking is permitted.

Another variation, [[cosom hockey]], uses plastic sticks and pucks, while [[gym ringette]] uses circular rings and sticks with no blade.

[[Power hockey]] is a floor hockey game similar to floorball that has been designed for players using electric wheelchairs.
Knee pads are required for the goal keeper

== Rules ==

Although floor hockey is made up of several different codes, there are some basic rules which are typically followed regardless of code.

With the exception of gym ringette, games start with a face-off, where a player from each team have an equal chance to gain possession. The face-off is also used to resume play after goals, and to start each period.

A goal is scored when the entire puck or ball crosses the plane of the goal line, unless it is intentionally kicked in by the attacking team.

The team with the most goals at the end of the game is declared the winner. If the game is tied, the games usually proceed into overtime in order to determine a winner.  Overtime rules vary, but typically include [[extra time]] and/or [[penalty shootout]].

Penalties for illegal actions are enforced.  A player committing a major infraction is required to sit out of the game for two minutes, resulting a [[power play (sport)|power play]], but a minor infraction may result in a free hit. Penalties are typically given for the following actions:
*  Tripping – Using the body or stick to intentionally cause a player to fall
*  Hooking – Using the curved end of the stick to impede a player’s forward progress by pulling him or her back
*  Slashing – Using the stick to hit an opposing player's body
*  Interference – Using the body to move a player from his current position on the floor or preventing him from playing the ball or puck
*  High Sticking – Allowing the curved end of the stick to come above your waist
*  Pushing Down – Using the stick to push an opponent down
*  Checking from behind – Hitting a player from behind

Due to the limited padding worn by players, body checking is typically disallowed in floor hockey games,&lt;ref name="nirsa.org"&gt;“NIRSA Floor Hockey Basics,” Last modified 2010, The National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association, http://www.nirsa.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Sports/IntramuralRules/im_floorhockey.htm&lt;/ref&gt; although shoulder-to-shoulder checking is allowed.

A '''foot arch stretcher''' (also known as a '''foot stretcher''', '''arch stretcher''', '''pointe stretcher''', '''toe stretcher''', or '''arch enhancer''') is a device used in the fields of [[ballet]], [[dance]], [[gymnastics]], [[cheerleading]], and other [[Sport of athletics|athletics]] in order to stretch the [[arches of the foot]]. It is believed that regular use of a foot arch stretcher may increase flexibility in the arch, [[ankle]], and [[metatarsal]] areas of the [[foot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://liveonpointe.blogspot.com/2014/08/how-to-improve-your-arches.html |title=How to Improve Your Arches |last1=May |first1=Clarissa |date=15 August 2014 |website=Live on Pointe |access-date=13 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A process necessary to avoid foot and ankle injury while participating in athletic activities.

== Components ==
A foot arch stretcher generally consists of two components: a '''base''' and a '''foot sleeve'''.

The '''base''' is generally one to two feet long and is made of a rigid material. In general, either the full base or parts of the base are covered with foam or another soft material and overlaid with fabric. This manufacturing process is used to both hold the shape of the foot arch stretcher and to provide comfort for the areas of the leg and foot that will come into contact with the base while in use. Sometimes, additional padding is added to the area of the foot stretcher base that will come into contact with the [[heel]] of the foot. This additional padding is added for comfort because the heel area usually receives the most leverage and accompanying pressure during the stretching process.

The '''foot sleeve''' is attached to the front portion of the base and is usually made of sturdy fabric or elastic. The purpose of the foot sleeve is to hold the foot in place during the stretching process. 

While this combination of a base and foot sleeve is the standard composition of most foot arch stretchers, it is important to note that some foot arch stretcher models have different components and function in a completely different manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discountdance.com/thumb.php?search=true&amp;skey=stretcher&amp;search=true&amp;SID=900000494&amp;rmfr=PROARCH |title=Pro Arch Pro-Arch  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Discount Dance Supply |access-date=18 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functionality ==
Foot arch stretchers normally function through proper application of the [[law of physics]] by applying [[Mechanical advantage|leverage]] as a [[mechanical advantage]]. 

Foot arch stretchers are generally used from a sitting position with the [[legs]] extended to the front. On most foot arch stretcher models, the user begins with a bent [[knee]] and places the front portion of the [[foot]] (including the [[toes]]) into the foot arch stretcher sleeve. Once the foot is secured in place, the user slides the foot arch stretcher forward along the floor while slowly straightening the leg. As the leg slides forward, leverage from the stretcher base increases while the foot sleeve keeps the toes in place. This, in effect, applies pressure and induces [[stretching]] of the muscles and tendons in the arch, [[ankle]], and [[metatarsal]] areas. The straighter the leg becomes, the more intense the stretch will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archgenie.com/how-it-works.php |title=How It Works |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=www.ArchGenie.com |publisher=Arch Genie L.L.C. |access-date=13 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Users ==
Foot arch stretchers are mainly used by [[ballet dancers]] ([[ballerinas]]) in order to aid the process of going "[[en pointe]]" or dancing on the tips of their toes. However, foot arch stretchers are also commonly used by all types of dancers ([[jazz dance]], [[tap dance]], [[modern dance]], [[hip-hop dance]], etc.) as well as [[gymnasts]], [[cheerleaders]], [[yoga]] practitioners, [[runners]], [[swimmers]], [[rowers]], [[martial artists]], [[ice skaters]] and other athletes looking for [[flexibility]] in the foot.{{fact|date=May 2016}}

== History ==
The commercial history of foot arch stretchers began around the turn of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archgenie.com/about-us.php |title=About Us  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=www.ArchGenie.com |access-date=19 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archgenie.com/about-product.php |title=About Our Product  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=www.ArchGenie.com |access-date=17 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are accounts of foot arch stretcher designs dating before that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ballethub.com/how-to-stretch-your-feet-safely-easily-for-more-flexibility/ |title=How to Stretch Your Feet Safely and Easily For More Flexibility  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=16 August 2013 |website=Ballet Hub |access-date=17 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the invention of foot arch stretchers, dancers found creative ways to stretch their feet: usually placing their feet under pianos or couches, or having a partner manually force the stretch.&lt;ref name=PC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theballetblog.com/portfolio/the-pros-and-cons-of-foot-stretchers/ |title=The Pros and Cons of Foot Stretchers  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=The Ballet Blog |access-date=17 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until the early 2000s that a few crafty dancers put their minds to work and came up with a solution. Between 2000 and 2001 foot arch stretchers first emerged in both the United States of America (with the Arch Genie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archgenie.com/about-product.php |title=Our Original Design  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=www.ArchGenie.com |access-date=17 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and in Europe (with the Ballet Footstretch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.footstretch.com |title=Home Page  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=www.footstretch.com |access-date=18 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Since the creation and introduction of these foot arch stretchers to the market, there have been many imitation foot stretchers flooding the market.

== Controversy ==
The safety and efficacy of using foot arch stretchers has been called into question by many dance and healthcare specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Brandt |first=Amy |date=15 March 2013 |title=Ask Amy: Are Foot Stretchers Safe? |url=http://pointemagazine.com/inside-pt/issuesaprilmay-2013ask-amy-are-foot-stretchers-safe/ |magazine=Pointe |location=New York, NY |publisher=Dance Media, L.L.C. |access-date=12 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacpt.com/oct2011-did-you-know |title=Did You Know... |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=San Antonio Center for Physical Therapy |access-date=13 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BtB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beyondthebarre.blogspot.com/2013/01/whats-better-high-arch-or-low-arch.html |title=What’s better?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2707">[[Image:Friends of Clean Accounts logo.png|thumb|right|250px|Logo of the group]]
'''Friends of Clean Accounts''' is a group of European politicians advocating and working towards "clean [[account (accountancy)|account]]s" of the [[European Union|EU]]. By this they mean ordinary (i.e., proper) accounting and controlling, leading to efficient use of funds throughout the EU. An important part of this endeavor is [[Transparency (humanities)|transparent]] information and free access to it.

==Overview==
This group has been initiated by people of the [[EU-critical]] [[SOS Democracy]], but comprises all those interested in its purpose – including proponents of the EU. [[Gabriele Stauner]] [http://stauner.de], member of the [[EU Parliament]]'s [[Budget Control Committee]], presides most of the group's meetings, organized by the group's speaker [[Jens-Peter Bonde]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://bonde.com bonde.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bonde.dk bonde.dk]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chris Heaton-Harris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heatonharris.org.uk heatonharris.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Friends of Clean Accounts also supports so called "[[whistle-blower]]s" in their fight against [[Political corruption|corruption]] within the [[EU institution]]s and [[EU project]]s. So they warred off the dismissal of [[Paul van Buitenen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2219114.stm Info] on [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt; Or invited the suspended Chief Auditor [[Marta Andreasen]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,1072-1389862,00.html Info] on ''[[The Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[EU Parliament]] to present her analyses of the grave faults of EU accounts and ways to improvement. Or  supported [[Hans-Martin Tillack]] – editor of ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'', who also revealed the [[Eurostat scandal]] and with [[Andreas Oldag]] is a co-author of a book on the EU ''Spaceship Brussels'' ''(Raumschiff Brüssel)'' – in his rights as he was arrested by Belgian police at the request of the EU anti-fraud office [[OLAF]].

They also made pressure on the [[Santer Commission]] to withdraw on March 19, 1999, collected signatures for the [[Motion of Censure against the Commission]] during spring of 2004 on the grounds of the [[Eurostat]] scandal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4921">'''Giovan Antonio Rusconi''' (c. 1500-05; † 1578) was a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[architect]], [[Hydraulic engineering|hydraulic engineer]], translator and illustrator of [[Vitruvius]].

== Life ==
[[File:Della architettvra (1590) (14769861931).jpg|thumbnail|''Della Architettvra''. Illustration.]]
Apart from being introduced into building and painting young Antonio Rusconi studied [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Padua]] under [[Giovanni Battista Memmo]] and [[Niccolò Tartaglia]]. Extensively consulting Vitruvius’ [[De architectura|"Ten Books on Architecture"]] while he was constructing a novel type of [[watermill]] Antonio became aware of many grave technical errors within the work’s early Renaissance editions and commentaries. Finally [[Pietro Lauro]], who had rendered [[Leon Battista Alberti|Leon Battista Alberti’s]] “De Architectura” into the vernacular, convinced Rusconi to set out with a translation of his own. The text was finished until 1552 and illustrated with more than three hundred supplementary [[woodcut]]s. Earlier, Rusconi had already provided the illustrations for [[Lodovico Dolce|Lodovico Dolce’s]] version of the [[Metamorphoses|Ovidian “Metamorphoses”]].
Yet, since then countless treatises on architecture and commentaries on [[Vitruvius]] (e.g. by [[Daniele Matteo Alvise Barbaro|Daniele Barbaro]], [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola|Gicaomo Vignola]] and [[Andrea Palladio]]) were being published, Rusconi’s Venetian editors, [[:de:Gabriele Giolito de’ Ferrari|Giolito]] and [[Tommaso Porcacchi]], saw no benefit in printing another title on the subject.
Together with [[Andrea Palladio|Palladio]] Rusconi draughted the [[Brescia#Piazza della Loggia|"Palazzo municipale" (Brescia)]] in 1562, they also took part in rebuilding the [[Doge's Palace]] after the fire of 1577 and constructing the [[Palazzo Grimani di Santa Maria Formosa|Palazzo Grimani]]. Nevertheless throughout his life Rusconi’s main occupation was that of a [[Hydraulic engineering|hydraulic engineer]] for the [[Republic of Venice]]. After having fallen gravely ill in 1575 Giovan Antonio died in 1579.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Anna Bedon, ''Giovan Antonio Rusconi: illustratore di Vitruvio, artista, ingegnere, architetto'', in: ''Della Architettura di Gio''[van]''Antonio Rusconi'', Centro Internazionale di Studi di Architettura Andrea Palladio di Vicenza, Testi e fonti per la storia dell’architettura, Verona, Vicenza 1996, pp. IX–XXI; Louis Cellauro, ''La biblioteca di un architetto del Rinascimento la raccolta di libri di Giovanni Antonio Rusconi'', in: Arte Veneta 58 (2001), pp. 224–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rusconi's "Della Architettura" ==
Rusconi’s “Vitruvius” was only printed after his death in 1590 by the son of his former editor [[:de:Gabriele Giolito de’ Ferrari|Giolito]]. Although the latter recognised the value of Giovan Antonio’s [[woodcut|xylographies]] he considered his translation and annotations as outdated, and thus a strange “Vitruvius without Vitruvius“ was published:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bedon 1996, p. XII: „questa strana edizione vitruviana senza Vitruvio, senza traduzione, senza autore.“&lt;/ref&gt; Just about 160 of originally 300 [[woodcut]]s were compiled with extracts from [[Giovanni Giocondo|Fra Giocondo’s]] and [[Cesare Cesariano|Cesariano’s]] translations of [[De architectura|Vitruvius’ treatise]]. For many of Rusconi’s illustrations containing references to textual explanations, it is particularly regrettable that his translation has hence been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Thomas Reiser, ''Giovan Antonio Rusconi (1515/20–1579)'', in: ''Firmitas et Splendor. Vitruv und die Techniken des Wanddekors'', ed. by Erwin Emmerling, [[:de:Andreas Grüner|Andreas Grüner]] et al., Munich 2014 (Studien aus dem Lehrstuhl für Restaurierung, [[Technische Universität München]], Fakultät für Architektur) {{ISBN|978-3-935643-62-7}}, pp. 269-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hany Farid''' is a professor of [[computer science]] at [[Dartmouth College]] and former chair of Dartmouth's [[Neukom Institute for Computational Science]].

Such manipulations can be used to alter or disguise the data.  In 2009, after digitally analyzing a photograph of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] holding a rifle and newspaper, Farid published his findings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1068/p6580 | journal=Perception | author=Farid, H | year=2009 | title=The Lee Harvey Oswald backyard photos: real or fake? | pages=1731–1734 | volume=38 | issue=11 | url=http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=p6580 | pmid=20120271}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluding that "the photo almost certainly was not altered".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2009/11/05.html Dartmouth Professor finds that iconic Oswald photo was not faked.] 11/05/09.&lt;/ref&gt; When the 2012 [[World Press Photo of the Year]] was alleged as being "fake", Farid spoke out against the allegation and criticized its underlying method, [[error level analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-05/16/photo-faking-controversy |title= 'Fake' World Press Photo isn't fake, is lesson in need for forensic restraint |first= Ian |last= Steadman |website= [[Wired UK]] |date= 2013-05-16 |accessdate= 2015-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in computer science and [[applied mathematics]] from the [[University of Rochester]] in 1989, his [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in computer science from [[University at Albany, SUNY|SUNY/Albany]] in 1992, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in computer science from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="Guggenheim" /&gt;

In June 2016, Farid, as a Senior Advisor to the [[Counter Extremism Project]] (CEP), unveiled a software tool for use by Internet and social media companies to "quickly find and eliminate extremist content used to spread and incite violence and attacks." It functions similarly to [[PhotoDNA]], a system that uses robust hashing technology Farid worked on developing with Microsoft, which is "now widely used by Internet companies to stop the spread of content showing sexual exploitation or pornography involving children."&lt;ref name="AFP"&gt;{{cite news |date=June 17, 2016 |title=Software unveiled to tackle online extremism, violence |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/software-unveiled-tackle-online-extremism-violence-180014703.html |agency=AFP }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=June 22, 2016 |title=A Tool to Delete Beheading Videos Before They Even Appear Online |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/06/a-tool-to-delete-beheading-videos-before-they-even-appear-online/488105/ |newspaper=The Atlantic }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=June 17, 2016 |title=Suppressing Extremist Speech: There’s an Algorithm for That! |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/06/17/suppressing-extremist-speech-theres-an-algorithm-for-that/ |newspaper=Foreign Policy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farid has been a strong proponent for companies such as Twitter, Google, and Facebook to use this technology to make their platforms safer, and to act as a moral fiber for the content on their sites. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thirteen.org/openmind/science/combating-extremism-online/5896/|title=Combating Extremism Online|last1=Hefner |first1=Alexander |last2=Farid |first2=Hany |last3=Wallace |first3=Mark |date=March 3, 2018 |website= The Open Mind, Thirteen |access-date=November 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
 
To operationalize this new technology to combat [[extremism]], Farid and CEP proposed the creation of a National Office for Reporting Extremism (NORex), which would house a comprehensive database of extremist content and function similar to the [[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]] (NCMEC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=June 21, 2016 |title=There’s a new tool to take down terrorism images online.

The '''Heroic Military College''' (officially in {{lang-es|'''Heroico Colegio Militar'''}}) is the major military educational institution in [[Mexico]]. It was founded in 1823 and located in the former Palace of the Inquisition in [[Mexico City]]. Initially designated as the ''Cadet Academy'' it was renamed in 1823 as the ''Colegio Militar''. The College was relocated in Perote, [[Veracruz]], before being returned to Mexico City where it was established in the Betlemitas monastery (today occupied by the Interactive Museum of the Economy and the Museum of the Mexican Army and Air Force).  From 1835 the Military College was located in the Recogidas Building (destroyed by an earthquake in 1985). Cadets training for the Mexican Navy originally formed part of the student body but in 1897 the [[Heroica Escuela Naval Militar|Military Naval School]] was established as a separate institution in [[Veracruz]].

The Military College comes under the supervision of the [[Mexican Army and Air Force University]] and the Army Military Education General Directorate.

== History of the College ==

===Foundation===
Although plans for a military academy were proposed as early as 1818, it would be only in 1822 when such plans materialized, with the efforts of Diego Garcia Conde, the ex-Spanish military officer then serving in the [[Mexican Army]], for such an academy to be formed were approved by the Mexican Imperial Government, through the Imperial War Ministry.

In the middle of the year, Emperor [[Agustin de Iturbide]] ordered that the  Former Inquisition Palace Complex become the headquarters of the now newly founded Military College of Mexico, the Military Cadet Academy and the Engineers Training School, all under their first director, Brigadier Diego Garcia Conde. By the next year, through the orders of War Minister General Jose Joaquin de Herrera, the  Military College of Mexico was relaunched as a separate academy with headquarters at [[San Carlos Fortress]], in [[Perote, Veracruz]] state. In 1824, in compliance with an order from [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Guadalupe Victoria]], 18 cadets of the now called ''Perote Military College of Mexico'', through the permission of then college director Col. Juan Dominguez y Galvez,  became the first cadets of the new ''Naval Aspirants College'' and the ''Tlacotalpan Nautical School'' trained to be the [[Mexican Navy]]'s future ship officers.

===Early years===
In 1828, due to a campaign against [[Secret society|secret societies]] and [[Freemasonry|masonic lodges]], Lt. Col. Manuel Montano's visit became the reason for the College's first loyalty act by the Corps of Cadets and its faculty, for their response to him was that the Military College should be exempted from the campaign due to the fact that no one in the College's cadet rosters were either secret society members nor Masons, and it turned into a national act of loyalty by the college cadets and faculty. As a result of this great deed, the College in March 1828 returned to Mexico City, first in the Bethelemitas convent and later in the Inquisition Palace Complex on July 1. By then, it began to be recognized by every Mexican as the nation's premier military educational institution.

The turmoil that sparked in the 1828 presidential elections took its toll on the College cadets. On September 11, a rebellion led by Generals [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]] and Jose Maria Lobato  denounced the election results ten days before, in which Manuel Gomez Pedraza emerged as the winner. Two months later, on November 30, they together with Lorenzo de Zavala and Col. Santiago Garcia staged a coup d'état that took over the La {{Not a typo|Acordada}} building demanding that the election results be voided by Congress. The same day, President Victoria called on the College cadets to proceed to the National Palace, and they fought on the side of the armed forces for 4 days until the fighting ended on December 4, with a compromise reached by both sides. Class would resume later the next day.

Political turmoil broke out again in 1840. On July 13 of that year Gen. [[Jose Urrea]] bolted out of jail and led a rebellion against President Anastacio Bustamante, who was later imprisoned in the presidential residence. General Gabriel Valencia then ordered all troops loyal to the President to proceed at once to the city citadel. These included the cadets of the Military College under its then director Brigade General Pedro Conde, who was received by Gen. Valencia and sent a delegation of cadets to the citadel. The College delegation then moved to a church where they fought anti-Bustamante troops, which resulted in two wounded cadets (Juan Rico and Antonio Groso), the former would later die of his wounds sustained. On the 16th President Bustamante left his residence and Gen. Vicente Filisola arrived at the church premises. On that night, when an armistice was made, the attempted coup was already over.

The next year, it relocated to the Chalpultepec Castle in Mexico City. This castle would be, in 6 years time, during the Mexican War, a place where 5 cadets and an officer in the faculty died in defense of the Mexican nation, and it would gain the ''Heroic'' designation. After a few years, the College relocated to the Inquisition Palace and later to San Lucas.

In 1846, the College's only naval director, Graduate Ship Captain Francisco Garcia began his duties as College Commandant, a duty lasting until 1847. A sudden rebellion by the Corps of Cadets happened during his tenure.

===The Niños Héroes===
The following year (1847), during the first term of Col. José Mariano Monterde Segura as commandant, the [[Mexican–American War]] reached Mexico City and the Military Academy. On September 11 cadets of the Academy were involved in fighting on the Condress Estate.  On September 13 Chapultepec Castle and its surroundings became the site of the historic [[Battle of Chapultepec]]. Its Mexican Army defenders, under the leadership of [[Nicolás Bravo]], former President and a veteran of the war of independence, included about 200 members of the Corps of Cadets, aged between 13 and 19. At the end of the battle five cadets -  Juan Escutia (who reportedly leapt to his death wrapped in the [[Flag of Mexico]]), Agustin Melgar, Francisco Marquez, Fernando Montes de Oca, and Vicente Suárez; plus faculty member Lieutenant of Engineers Juan de la Barrera; all refused to retreat and died in a final stand as the "young heroes" of Academy legend. An unknown proportion of the other cadets became casualties or prisoners during the earlier stages of the battle.

Each year on the anniversary of the battle, the sacrifice of the five [[Niños Héroes]] of the Military Academy is remembered nationwide, with a national ceremony at the monument with the Corps in attendance.

===1857-1920===
In 1858, during the term of Commandant Colonel Luis Tola Algarín, the College moved its facilities to the former Church of Sts. Peter and Paul in Mexico City.  During the [[Reform War]] the same year the Corps of Cadets was involved in a clash with the forces of Gen. Miguel Blanco on October 15 in [[Toluca]]. Casualties suffered by the cadets and instructors in this and subsequent actions caused the closure of the College in 1861.

The College was reopened in 1867. Located first in the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] the College was moved to various locations before returning to the Chapultepec Castle in 1882. Formerly a joint services institution, the College became an academy for the Mexican Army only in 1897, following the establishment of the Military Naval School in Veracruz.

On 8 February 1913 the 600 cadets of the Military College played a part in the coup known as The [[Ten Tragic Days]] against President [[Francisco Madero]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Atkin, page 126 "Revolution! Mexico 1910-20", Granada Publishing Ltd. 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Cadets of the separate ''Escuela Militar de Aspirantes de Tlalpan'' (established in 1905 as an additional academy for training junior officers) had joined with regular army units in an ultimately successful attempt to overthrow Madero. However a detachment of cadets from the Heroic Military College, acting on the orders of Deputy Commandant Lieutenant Colonel Víctor Hernández Covarrubias  escorted President Madero from Chapultepec Castle to the National Palace on the following day. Termed the ''Loyalty March'', this action is still marked by an annual parade by the Corps of Cadets, attended by the present-day [[President of Mexico]] and his Cabinet.

The new government down-graded the role of the Heroic Military College, briefly merging its functions with those of the ''Escuela Militar de Aspirantes de Tlalpan'' and accelerating the training of cadets from both academies to reinforce the crumbling Federal Army. Following the overthrow of General [[Victoriano Huerta]] in July 1914 and the disbandment of the Federal Army, the College was closed. It was reestablished in February 1920 albelt in a new campus in Popotla, Mexico City. Later that spring the then reestablished cavalry squadron were involved in what has been termed "the final cavalry charge in the Americas". This occurred on May 8, when on the orders of Colonel Rodolfo Casillas the cadets acted in support of regular army dragoons led by General Pilar Sanchez under attack by rebel forces in Apizaco, Tlaxcala. In another engagement two days later a cadet was killed in action in San Marcos while supporting government forces.

==The College from 1947 to today==
In 1947 The Military College celebrated the centenary of the Corps of Cadets' participation in the Battle of Chapultepec, the finest hour of its history.  In 1949, the [[Congress of the Union]] formally conferred the "Heroic" designation to both the Corps and to the Midshipmen's Battalion of the Naval Military Academy, the latter for its role in resisting the [[United States occupation of Veracruz]] in 1914.

To celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Heroic Military College (1820-1970), 1 oz silver coins were minted by the Central Bank. In addition stamps featuring two Military College [[shako]]s were printed by the Government of Mexico. A special issue of stamps also commemorated the Golden Jubilee of "the final cavalry charge in the Americas"; carried out by the cavalry cadets of the college in 1920 (see above).

In 1976, the College's present campus in [[Tlalpan]] Borough, [[Mexico City]], was formally opened, partially damaged by the 1985 earthquake that struck the city. Today, the commandant of the academy is Brigade General Julio Álvarez Arellano.

The school was used as a setting for [[Luis Miguel]]'s 1989 music video [["La Incondicional"]]. In the video he plays an Air Force cadet who is in love, but he must take his stuides as soldier seriously. In a marching scene towards the end of the song one can see the "Por el Honor de Mexico" banner.

Perote, the second home of the Military College, has been dubbed by the Veracruz State Congress as ''The Cradle of the Military College'' since 2002.

From 2007, the academy has accepted female cadets. The present Corps is regiment-sized and has among its units a cavalry squadron and an artillery battery, plus an armored cavalry training squadron raised recently - a first in a military academy in Latin America.

== Motto and Collegiate Slogan ==
''Por el Honor de Mexico'' (''For Mexico's Honor'') is the college motto, made in a contest organized by radio station XEQ in commemoration of the centenary of the defense of Chalpultepec Castle in 1947.

Every midday, after the afternoon ceremony and before the midday parade, the following cheer is done by the Corps of Cadets:

* Cadet Corps Commander: "Heroico Colegio Militar" ("Heroic Military College")
* Cadets: ''Por el Honor de Mexico!'' (''For Mexico's Honor!'')

== Collegiate Hymn and March ==

=== Hymn of the Heroic Military College ===
The Hymn of the Heroic Military College was composed in 1930 by Prof. José Ignacio Ríos del Río.&lt;ref name="sedena.gob.mx"&gt;http://www.sedena.gob.mx/index.php?id=234&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lyrics===
'''Spanish'''&lt;br /&gt;
''Chorus'' &lt;br /&gt;
Vibre el clarín de la guerra, resuenen las fanfarrias&lt;br /&gt;
Redoblen los tambores, una marcha triunfal&lt;br /&gt;
Y lleven de la Patria a todos los confines&lt;br /&gt;
Tu nombre sacrosanto,&lt;br /&gt; 
Colegio Militar&lt;br /&gt;
Tu nombre sacrosanto,&lt;br /&gt; 
Colegio Militar

''Verse&lt;br /&gt;
Colegio sacrosanto, de memoria bendita&lt;br /&gt;
de forjaran sus almas, Montes de Oca y Melgar&lt;br /&gt;
La Patria bate marcha de honor a tu pasado,&lt;br /&gt;
de epopeyas gloriosas y de nombre inmortal.

Y en un gesto sublime de amor y de cariño,&lt;br /&gt;
bendice a los efebos que supieron morir &lt;br /&gt;
bañados por las ráfagas de luz espendorosa&lt;br /&gt;
que el ángel de la gloria enviara del cenit.

''Repeat Chorus''

=== Regimental March of the Heroic Military College ===
The Regimental March was composed by Lieutenant José Sotero Ortiz Sánchez, in time for the College's 1947 centenary of the Battle of Chapultepec.

===Lyrics===
'''Spanish'''&lt;br /&gt;
Páginas del libro de la historia del Heroico Colegio Militar&lt;br /&gt;
de epopeyas que ya jamás se borran del santuario de la inmortalidad.&lt;br /&gt;
Canto que se eleva a la memoria como ofrenda de honor a la lealtad &lt;br /&gt;
de los héroes que envueltos por la gloria grandioso ejemplo que nos dio la libertad. &lt;br /&gt;
''Repeat All''

Juventud de mi patria sublime, que marcháis con gallarda ilusión&lt;br /&gt; 
aumentáreis la historia que escribe nobles hechos de sangre y honor.&lt;br /&gt; 
Yunque forjador de hombres de guerra como Suárez, Escutia y Melgar,&lt;br /&gt;
Montes de Oca, Márquez y De la Barrera, los niños héroes de mi México inmortal!&lt;br /&gt;
''Repeat All''

== History ==

IES Abroad offered its first program in September 1950, when Paul Koutny, an [[Austrians|Austrian]] student living in the [[United States|U.S.]] on a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]] scholarship, brought American students to live and study in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] for a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iesabroad.org/study-abroad/about/history |title=History &amp;#124; IES Abroad}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of the students from the original program, newlyweds Clarence and Alberta Giese, returned after the program inspired to help other students study abroad.  From their [[Chicago]] home, they worked with Koutny to recruit more students and send them abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Salts, Josh (20 Jan 2011). "[http://www.reformer.com/localnews/ci_17142553?source=rss Educational Pioneers]" ''Battleboro Reformer''.  Retrieved 6 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
IES Abroad developed a Model Assessment Practice &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iesabroad.org/study-abroad/advisors-faculty/ies-abroad-map |title=MAP Series &amp;#124; IES Abroad}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999 as a framework for the design, development, and evaluation of programs of study abroad.  This program formed the basis for the standards of the [[Forum on education abroad|Forum on Education Abroad]] adopted by the field.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, Joan et al., "[https://books.google.com/books?id=N4ifF9FfwcEC&amp;pg=PA457&amp;lpg=PA457&amp;dq=%22ies+abroad%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pVhUnFn7Z3&amp;sig=MLDKhntUq0Kvv8mPcwY5qW-g8Bg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=h7AFUoiXLIjUyQHM_oCwAQ&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBTgo#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ies%20abroad%22&amp;f=false Holistic Student Learning and Development Abroad: The IES 3-D Program Model]," ''The Handbook of Practice and Research in Study Abroad'' at 457 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, IES Abroad was the first third-party provider to receive the [[Forum on education abroad|Forum on Education Abroad]]'s Category 2b Quality Improvement Designation, which involves independent reviewers using evaluation systems to make program improvements.

'''''Introducing Kafka''''', also known as '''''R. Crumb's Kafka''''', is an illustrated biography of [[Franz Kafka]] by [[David Zane Mairowitz]] and [[Robert Crumb]]. The book includes comic adaptations of some of Kafka's most famous works including ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'', ''[[A Hunger Artist]]'', ''[[In the Penal Colony]]'', and ''[[The Judgment]]'', as well as brief sketches of his three novels ''[[The Trial]]'', ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]'', and ''[[Amerika (novel)|Amerika]]''. The book also details Kafka's biography in a format that is part illustrated essay, part sequential comic panels.  

== Publication history ==
The book was released as part of the "[[Introducing... (book series)|Introducing...]]" series by Totem Books; the popularity of Crumb's renditions of Kafka's works led to additional printings under the title ''R. Crumb's Kafka'', and its most recent edition by [[Fantagraphics Books]] (2007) is simply titled ''Kafka''.

==Content==
The book focuses on the biographical details of Kafka's life, interspersed with illustrated vignettes from his writing. The author relates Kafka's personality and various incidents in his life to the composition of his stories. For example, Kafka's complicated relationship with his family is linked to stories where the main character is an animal – notably ''The Metamorphosis'' whose protagonist, Gregor Samsa, awakens to find himself transformed into a giant bug, and becomes a burden on his family.

'''LAMS''', the Learning Activity Management System, is an [[Open-source software|open source]] [[Instructional design|Learning Design]] system for designing, managing and delivering online collaborative learning activities. It provides teachers with an intuitive visual authoring environment for creating sequences of learning activities. These activities can include a range of individual tasks, small group work and whole class activities based on both content and collaboration. LAMS is 'inspired' by the concept and principles of [[IMS Learning Design]].&lt;ref&gt;Learning Design inspiration - CETIS http://zope.cetis.ac.uk/content2/20031105152011&lt;/ref&gt;

LAMS is developed in collaboration with LAMS Foundation and a number of educational institutions around the world. LAMS has been developed since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Implementing learning design: the learning activity management system (LAMS) {{cite web |url=http://www.ascilite.org.au/conferences/adelaide03/docs/pdf/593.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706124109/http://ascilite.org.au/conferences/adelaide03/docs/pdf/593.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;. LAMS International (Sydney) and LAMS Education Asia (Singapore) are commercial companies that provide development and support services for the LAMS platform. 

== Community ==
The LAMS community website is a global community website for teachers and developers who use the LAMS software.  As of March 2018, the LAMS Community had over 12000 members across 80 countries sharing 3750 sequences (downloaded 32252, previewed 83102 times) and 8592 discussion forum postings.&lt;ref&gt;For statistics for LAMS Community, March, 2018, http://lamscommunity.org/stats&lt;/ref&gt;

LAMS creates "digital lesson plans" that can be run online with students, as well as shared among teachers. The LAMS Community allows teachers to share and adapt digital lesson plans, and discuss their experiences of using LAMS. Teachers, trainers and professors can find digital lessons plans that are freely available to use and adapt, and they can share their own and adaptations.  There is a Greek LAMS community.

=== LAMS Central ===

The LAMS Community has a central repository of learning designs (LAMS Central Repository). These are LAMS sequences shared by teachers and practitioners that use LAMS in their teaching. The subjects of these designs vary widely, from Higher Ed Science subjects to basic k-12.

== Awards and recognitions ==

LAMS in conjunction with the associated LAMS Community won a Gold Award and Best Learning System at the IMS Global Learning Consortium's Learning Impact Awards (LIAs) in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;IMS Learning Impact Awards 2009 http://www.imsglobal.org/pressreleases/pr090514.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Available versions ==

As of June 2018, the current stable version of LAMS is 3.0.2&lt;ref&gt;Download links and building instructions are provided on the LAMS Documentation Wiki at https://wiki.lamsfoundation.org/display/lams/Downloads&lt;/ref&gt; Version 3.0 is a major release that introduces a responsive web design, drops the need to have Adobe Flash Player, updated all its tech stack and adds significant feature and technical improvements. &lt;ref&gt;LAMS 3.0 feature list  https://wiki.lamsfoundation.org/display/lams/LAMS+3.0+Feature+List&lt;/ref&gt;

LAMS version 3.1 is available as beta release (Oct 2018).

== LAMS integrations with other LMS==

LAMS can be integrated with any LMS system that implement [[Learning Tools Interoperability|IMS LTI]] as a consumer. However, IMS LTI 1.2 has some important limitations, therefore native integration with other popular LMSs are available for:

* [[Moodle]] version 2.x and 3.x
* [[Sakai Project|Sakai]]
* [[Blackboard Inc.|Blackboard]]
* [[OpenACS|.LRN]]
* [[WebCT]]
* [[SharePoint]]
* [[OLAT]]

LAMS is both a IMS LTI 1.3 consumer and service provider, including Deep Linking and Membership extensions. 

== LAMS Tool Contract ==

The LAMS Tool Contract is an architecture to allow Tool Interoperability across [[Learning Management System]]s (LMS). It allows tools (web applications) to become "pluggable" in any [[learning management system|LMS]].&lt;ref&gt;LAMS "Tools Contract". TenCompetence Workshop. UPF - Barcelona. 21 de Junio 2007. Ernie Ghiglione &amp; James Dalziel {{cite web |url=http://www.tencompetence.org/files/Barcelona/presentations/session1/Ghiglione.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822223330/http://www.tencompetence.org/files/Barcelona/presentations/session1/Ghiglione.pdf |archivedate=2007-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The LAMS Tool Contract is the underlying architecture of LAMS and currently tools from other platforms like Moodle and dotLRN can be used within LAMS.&lt;ref&gt;Tool Adapters http://wiki.lamsfoundation.org/display/lams/Tool+Adapters&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conferences ==

These international conferences are academic conferences where papers submitted are peer-reviewed by members of the conference committee. The main topics of this conferences are LAMS and Learning Design and are mainly in English (although there has been one in Spanish). The first LAMS Conference was in Sydney Australia in December, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;The First International LAMS Conference http://lamsfoundation.org/lams2006/&lt;/ref&gt; Usually there are two conferences a year, one in Australia and one in Europe or Asia.

'''The Dive Lectures''' are a series of public lectures that have been hosted at the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in London every year since 2005 as part of an ongoing programme&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rgs.org/WhatsOn/Whats+on.htm Royal Geographical Society What's On]&lt;/ref&gt; of events by the Society and the [[London Diving Chamber]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londondivingchamber.co.uk/ The London Diving Chamber]&lt;/ref&gt;  to promote exploration and adventure sports. Featuring keynote presentations by well-known figures in diving, television, exploration, photography and environmentalism, the lectures have developed into a well-attended social and professional forum for the British scuba industry as well as a popular fund-raising occasion for diving-related charities.

==Dive Lectures==
The first Dive Lecture was inaugurated in March 2002 under the auspices of the London Diving Chamber which provides [[National Health Service|NHS]]-funded recompression to divers with Decompression Sickness (DCS) together with other Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) treatments&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2328113/How-diving-chamber-heals-damage-left-prostate-cancer-treatment.html/ Hyperbaric Therapy For Cancer Victims]&lt;/ref&gt; from its recompression chamber at [[Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth|The Hospital of St John &amp; St Elizabeth]] in [[St. John's Wood]], London.

Sometimes held annually, sometimes biannually, the lectures are free to attend but also act as fund-raising occasions for diving-related charities such as The Scuba Trust,&lt;ref&gt;[http://scubatrust.org/ The Scuba Trust]&lt;/ref&gt; an organisation helping divers with disabilities.

In 2005, the lectures took up their now regular venue at the RGS. Initially, they were held in the Map Room of Lowther Lodge, subsequent events have been held in the 500-seat auditorium, The Ondaatje Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rgs.org/VenueHire/Virtual+tour/Ondaatje+Theatre.htm The Ondaatje Theater at the Royal Geographical Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representative Speakers 2007-17==
From its inception in 2002, the London Diving Chamber Annual Dive Lectures has attracted well-known figures from the diving world and celebrities interested in diving to speak to its audience. In its earliest years, the event was introduced by [[Lloyd Grossman]] and [[Mariella Frostrup]], and speakers included Paul Toomer, Phil Docking and [[Bob Cole (diver)|Bob Cole]].

==Life==
Lowenstein was born Maria Lilli Margarete Baetge in [[Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.library.du.edu/librariespresents/exhibits/show/the-lowenstein-family/family-heritage/maria-lilli-margarete-baetge&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914 in [[Helsinki]], she married  architect Erich Steinberg, by whom she had a daughter, Karin, (1915-2014).&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.library.du.edu/librariespresents/exhibits/show/the-lowenstein-family/family-heritage/maria-lilli-margarete-baetge&lt;/ref&gt; After fleeing from the tumult of the [[Russian Revolution]], Maria moved to [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]], where her husband, Erich Steinberg, died in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;http://duarchives.coalliance.org/repositories/2/resources/565&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1925, Maria married the Jewish German dermatologist Max Loewenstein; their son, Henry, was born that same year.&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.library.du.edu/librariespresents/exhibits/show/the-lowenstein-family/family-heritage/dr--max-loewenstein&lt;/ref&gt; Among the friends of Max and Maria was the composer [[Kurt Weill]].&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.library.du.edu/librariespresents/exhibits/show/the-lowenstein-family/family-heritage/henry--heinrich--loewenstein&lt;/ref&gt;

Having previously studied at the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg]], Maria refined her artistic talents at the Institute of Fine Arts in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.library.du.edu/librariespresents/exhibits/show/the-lowenstein-family/family-heritage/maria-lilli-margarete-baetge&lt;/ref&gt;

Although she saw her son to safety in 1938 during the [[Kindertransport]], she and her husband and daughter stayed in Berlin during the war, where she was involved in the [[Rosenstrasse protests]] of wives of Jewish men. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.library.du.edu/librariespresents/exhibits/show/the-lowenstein-family/survival-in-berlin--1939-1945/rosenstrasse-protest&lt;/ref&gt; Lowenstein emigrated to the United States in 1946 and settled first in [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania]], where one of her students was [[Barrie Karp]]. Max Loewenstein died in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.library.du.edu/librariespresents/exhibits/show/the-lowenstein-family/family-heritage/dr--max-loewenstein&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Maria  settled in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] where her son, Henry (1925-2014), became prominent on the theatre scene as a producer and set designer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.denvercenter.org/blog-posts/news-center/2014/10/07/henry-lowenstein-father-of-denver-theatre-passes-away&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Shakespeare Conservatory''' was an [[acting]] school in [[New York City]], offering a two-year certificate program and an eight-week summer training program. The Conservatory was founded in 1974 by Philip Meister, Albert Schoemann and Mario Siletti.&lt;ref name="SilettiObit"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate =  2007-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Conservatory was an offshoot of the National Shakespeare Company, a professional acting company that toured productions of Shakespeare and the classics to colleges and universities throughout the US and Canada.  The Summer Conservatory was first offered at the Byrdcliffe Theatre in Woodstock, N.Y. in 1974, and moved its facilities to Kerhonkson, N.Y. in 1978, where it continued summer operations until 1998.

The Conservatory expanded to a Two Year Program in New York City in 1977, and was situated in the National Shakespeare Company's brownstone studios and offices on West 51 Street near 9th Avenue in Manhattan, along with The Cubiculo, an off-off-Broadway theatre, also owned and  operated by the National Shakespeare Company.  After Meister's death in 1982, Siletti and Schoemann established The Conservatory as a separate entity from the National Shakespeare Company, and moved the operation of the Two Year Program to lower Broadway in Soho.

The National Shakespeare Conservatory was one of the first independent professional actor training programs in the U.S. to become an institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Theatre in 1978; a status gained only through the peer review process of accreditation.

The Conservatory's training emphasized classical plays, utilizing a broad array of contemporary acting techniques – physical, vocal and internal – that enabled the voice and body to support the actor's internal choices. The integration of the physical and vocal with internal techniques with a strong classical base was the hallmark of Conservatory's intensive training.

The Summer Program and the first year of training in the Two Year Program was devoted to intensive classes in scene study, acting technique, Shakespeare, movement, dance, voice, improvisation and music. The second year was devoted to rigorous advanced study in the same areas. As part of the curriculum, the second year included a one-person show and [[Off-Off-Broadway]] showcases.

Many of the National Shakespeare Conservatory teachers were professional actors recruited by Meister, Schoemann and Siletti to serve as faculty, beginning their teaching careers at The Conservatory, and subsequently teaching at the [[Stella Adler Studio of Acting]], its undergraduate studio program at New York University, and other colleges and universities.

Beginning in 1994, the US Department of Education raised its requirement for the National Shakespeare Conservatory to post a Letter of Credit in order to continue participation in the federal student aid programs.  Because of The Conservatory's quality of accreditation review, low student loan default rate and consistent long term operation as a non-profit organization, The Conservatory considered the amount of the Letter of Credit excessive and contested it in federal court.  After a two-year battle with the USDE the federal judge ruled against the school.  The National Shakespeare Conservatory then offered to post the Letter of Credit. The Department of Education refused to accept the Letter of Credit from the National Shakespeare Conservatory, and terminated the Conservatory's participation in federal student financial assistance programs, based on the school's failure to provide a sufficient letter of credit in 1996.&lt;ref name="DOEcase"&gt;{{Cite web

  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a consequence, the school ceased operations of the Two Year training program that fall.

The Summer Conservatory continued to operate for the next two years.  In 1996 in addition to its training program, it provided free outdoor performances of Shakespeare in municipal parks in upstate New York, under the banner Catskill Shakespeare until the school closed in late 1998.

'''Open University of Cyprus''' is a '''public Higher Education Institution,''' operating under the effective control of the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic of Cyprus. Established in 2002, OUC is the country’s only University '''devoted entirely to open and distance education and lifelong learning'''. OUC offers '''interdisciplinary, career-oriented and accredited Bachelor’s, Master’s and PhD degree programmes''' in both ‘classical’ and ‘cutting edge’ scientific areas. 


==Mission==

Open University of Cyprus aspires to provide students with lifelong learning opportunities and higher education degrees useful to start or advance their professional careers, and fulfill their personal aspirations and goals. The University aims to combine its international reach and flexible operations and structure, using both to support the State’s vision to establish Cyprus as a regional centre for education, scientific research and innovation, a hub for international scholars and students alike. Towards this direction, OUC expands its network of collaborators and establishes strong partnerships with Universities and research institutions in Cyprus, the broader region and beyond, promoting educational and research cooperation and mobility of students and staff. 

==Educational Methodology and Programmes of Study==

Open University of Cyprus is a dedicated open and distance learning University. Its educational technology, in combination with modern teaching and learning methods supported by multi-format educational materials, '''respond to the diverse needs of its students, allowing them to study wherever and whenever they wish, using any digital platform.
'''
Accordingly, OUC’s distance education and '''blended learning methodology''' differs from conventional classroom-based education, mainly because it allows '''students''' to '''complete their studies and obtain their degree, breaking down the rigid barriers of traditional education''', without physically attending scheduled lectures, and – in case students are already employed – without disrupting work routines or leaving their workplace.  

eLearning Platform - eClass

The University’s main educational tool is the '''eLearning Platform eClass''' that facilitates online teaching and learning through the establishment of '''virtual classrooms,''' supports '''lecture capture, live and video on demand lectures and tutorials,''' and integrates '''real-time and asynchronous collaboration tools.''' Concisely, OUC’s eLearning Platform is a comprehensive and constantly evolving eLearning system backing the educational process across all its phases. 

Students use eClass to:
	
*access their course materials,  
*organise their study calendars,  
*communication with tutors and fellow students, 
*submit their formative assignments and coursework, and  
*receive feedback on their progress. 

In a true collaborative environment, the eLearning platform also supports live interaction and direct contact with academics, peers and fellow students. The synchronous collaboration (virtual classrooms, live streaming) and asynchronous (forums, instant messaging) communication tools are fully utilised by experienced and dedicated academic staff, offering '''effective and interactive academic support,''' guidance and advice. Moreover, virtual labs have further enhanced the University’s educational capabilities in supporting and offering high quality innovative programmes in any subject. 

Despite being ‘distance’ in essence, learning experience at OUC is complemented by academics-students group tutorials that are scheduled throughout the academic year and, while not mandatory, they play a key supporting role in educational processes. These '''tutorials''' are '''organised either with physical presence or are conducted online''' using ''' eClass virtual classes, and are academically challenging and rigorous. To ensure the integrity of OUC degrees and examination processes, students are required to attend in person (at examination centres in Cyprus, Greece or elsewhere under certain conditions) the final written exams, which count towards a significant percentage of their overall grade.

==Study at OUC==

OUC’s extensive range of Programmes of Study covers subject areas in undergraduate (BA, BSc) and postgraduate level (MA, MSc, PhD) offered in Greek and English by its three Faculties:

* [http://www.ouc.ac.cy/web/guest/s1 Humanities and Social Sciences]
* [http://www.ouc.ac.cy/web/guest/s2 Pure and Applied Sciences]
* [http://www.ouc.ac.cy/web/guest/s3 Economics and Management] 

The detailed list of Programmes of Study and related courses offered by Open University of Cyprus can be found [http://www.ouc.ac.cy/web/guest/university/programme here]

==Administration==

OUC is a State University, and its main decision-making bodies are the following:

* The Council
* The Senate
The Director of Administration and Finance is the head of the University’s administration, and acts as Secretary of the Senate and the Council.

'''Physics outreach''' encompasses facets of [[science outreach]] and [[physics education]] and is an [[umbrella term]] for a variety of activities by schools, [[research institutes]], [[universities]], clubs and institutions such as [[science museums]] aimed at broadening the audience for and awareness and understanding of physics. While the general public may sometimes be the focus of such activities, physics outreach often centers on developing and providing resources and making presentations to students, educators in other disciplines, and in some cases researchers within different areas of physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Public engagement, IOP Institute of Physics|url=http://www.iop.org/activity/outreach/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Physics Outreach, American Physical Society (APS)|url=https://www.aps.org/programs/outreach/index.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=website for QuarkNet (a nonprofit collaboration, funded by the National Science Foundation and dedicated to developing the USA's technological workforce)|url=https://quarknet.org/content/about-quarknet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ongoing efforts to expand the understanding of physics to a wider audience have been undertaken by individuals and institutions since the early 19th century. Historic works, such as the ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', and [[Two New Sciences]] by [[Galileo Galilei]], sought to present revolutionary knowledge in astronomy, frames of reference, and kinematics in a manner that a general audience could understand with great effect.

In the mid 1800s, English physicist and chemist, [[Michael Faraday]]&lt;ref&gt;Lan, Boon Leong, and Jeanette B. S. Lim. "Michael Faraday: Prince Of Lecturers In Victorian England." The Physics Teacher (Stony Brook, N.Y.) 39.1 (2001): 32-36.&lt;/ref&gt; gave a series of nineteen lectures aimed towards young adults with the hopes of conveying scientific phenomena. His intentions were to raise awareness, inspire them and generate revenue of the [[Royal Institution]]. This series became known as the [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Christmas lectures]], and still continues today. By the early 20th century, the public notoriety of physicists such as [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Marie Curie]], and inventions such as radio led to a growing interest in physics. In 1921, in the United States, the establishment of [[Sigma Pi Sigma]] physics honor society at universities was instrumental in the expanding number of physics presentations, and led to the creation of physics clubs open to all students.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, P. (1996, October 1). History. Retrieved from http://www.sigmapisigma.org/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Museums were an important form of outreach but most early [[science museums]] were generally focused on [[natural history]]. Some specialized museums, such as the Cavendish Museum at [[University of Cambridge]], housed many of the historically important pieces of apparatus that contributed to the major discoveries by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]], [[J. J. Thomson|Thomson]], [[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Visit the Cavendish Museum. (2008, January 1). Retrieved from http://www-outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/cav_museum/.&lt;/ref&gt; However, such venues provided little opportunity for [[hands-on learning]] or demonstrations.

In August 1969, [[Frank Oppenheimer]] dedicated his new [[Exploratorium]] in [[San Francisco]] primarily to interactive science exhibits that demonstrated principles in physics. The Exploratorium published the details of their own exhibits in 'Cookbooks' that served as an inspiration to many other museums around the world, and since then has diversified into many outreach programs. Oppenheimer had researched European science museums while on a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1965. He noted that three museums served as important influences on the Exploratorium: the [[Palais de la Découverte]], which displayed models to teach scientific concepts and employed students as demonstrators, a practice that directly inspired the Exploratorium's much-lauded High School Explainer Program; the [[South Kensington Museum]] of Science and Art, which Oppenheimer and his wife visited frequently; and the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich, the world's largest science museum, which had a number of interactive displays that impressed the Oppenheimers.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Frank Oppenheimer - Biography (long). (2014, January 1) Retrieved from http://www.exploratorium.edu/about/history/frank.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ensuing years, physics outreach, and science outreach more generally, continued to expand and took on new popular forms, including highly successful television shows such as [[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]], first broadcast in 1980.

As a form of outreach within the physics education community for teachers and students, in 1997 the US [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) and Department of Energy [[USDOE]] established [[QuarkNet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quarknet.fnal.gov|title=QuarkNet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a professional teacher development program. In 2012, the [[University of Notre Dame]] received a $6.1M, five-year grant to support a nationwide expansion of the Quarknet program. Also in 1997, the European Particle Physics Outreach Group, led by [[Christopher Llewellyn Smith]], [[Royal Society|FRS]], and Director General of [[CERN]], was formed to create a community of scientists, science educators, and communication specialists in science education and public outreach for particle physics.  This group became the [http://ippog.web.cern.ch International Particle Physics Outreach Group] (IPPOG) in 2011 after the start up of the [[LHC]]&lt;ref&gt;About IPPOG. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://ippog.web.cern.ch/content/2011/about-ippog&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innovation==
Many contemporary initiatives in physics outreach have begun to shift focus, transcending traditional field boundaries, seeking to engage students and the public by integrating elements of aesthetic design and popular culture. The goal has been not only to push physics out of a strictly [[science education]] framework but also to draw in professionals and students from other fields to bring their perspectives on physical phenomena. Such work includes artists creating sculptures using [[ferrofluid]]s, and art photography using [[High-speed photography|high speed]] and [[Femto-photography|ultra high speed photography]].

Other efforts, such as [[University of Cambridge]]'s [http://www-outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/physics_at_work/ Physics at Work] program have created annual events to demonstrate to secondary students uses of physics in everyday life and a [http://www-spc.phy.cam.ac.uk Senior Physics Challenge]. Seeing the importance these initiatives, Cambridge has established a full-time physics outreach organization, an [http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/outreach Educational Outreach Office], and aspirations for a Center of Physics and expanded industrial partnerships that "would include a well equipped core team of outreach officers dedicated to demonstrating the real life applications of physics, showing that physics is an accessible and relevant subject".&lt;ref&gt;The Future of Outreach. Retrieved from http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/outreach/development&lt;/ref&gt;

The French research group, [http://hebergement.u-psud.fr/supraconductivite/index_en.html La Physique Autrement] (Physics Reimagined), of the [https://www.lps.u-psud.fr/?lang=en Laboratoire de Physique des Solides] works on research about new ways to present modern [[solid-state physics]] and to engage the general public. In 2013, [[Physics Today]] covered this group in an article entitled "Quantum Physics For Everyone"[http://hebergement.u-psud.fr/supraconductivite/pdf/physics_today_bobroff.pdf] which discussed how with the help of designers and unconventional demonstrations, the project sought out and succeeded to engage people who never thought of themselves as interested in science.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Rising Sun Institute''', established in 1984 by Dr. Abdul Tawwab Khan &amp; Mrs. Parveen Abdul Tawwab, is a [[special education]] center for mentally and physically challenged children in [[Lahore]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]]. It has two campuses located in [[Defence Housing Authority, Lahore|DHA]] and [[Mughalpura]].
Rising Sun Institute is a project of “Rising Sun Education and Welfare Society” a not-for-profit and charity-based organization, working for the welfare of special children.  It is the largest Institute for special education in Pakistan providing education, vocational &amp; computer training, physio, hydro, speech therapy and various other forms of rehabilitation facilities to more than 600 Children with Intellectual &amp; Visual Impairment, Cerebral Palsy and Autism. The services rendered include individualized education programs, free transportation, Games, Sports &amp; Cultural activities are also the integral part of the total program.

==History==
Rising Sun Education &amp; Welfare Society is working in the field of special education since 1984. Its Vision &amp; Mission are in line with article 23 of  Convention of Rights of the Child 1989:

[[Rising Sun Education &amp; Welfare Society|Vision]]:
“To make special children confident and self-reliant members of the society” 

[[Rising Sun Education &amp; Welfare Society|Mission]]:
“ To provide these children with all the educational &amp; training facilities to enhance their capabilities and rehabilitate them in the society” – 
Rising Sun Institute for Special children is one of its major projects. 
In 1984, The Rising Sun Institute (RSI) started working with only 2 special children in the dining room of Dr. and Mrs. Abdul Tawwab Khan. RSI now has over 750 enrolled children in [[Defence Housing Authority, Lahore|DHA]] campus and Mughalpura campus.
== Services ==
Currently two campuses of Rising Sun Institute for special children (RSI) are working under umbrella of RSE&amp;WS and catering to the needs of 750 Special needs students. Teaching &amp; training facilities are provided to children with intellectual impairment, physical disabilities, visual impairment, hearing impairment, Autism, Downs Syndrome, cerebral palsy and multiple disabilities.


 


•	Teaching and training program focuses on the teaching of basic skill of self-care and independent living to the special children. This is the first step in their training towards making them independent, self-reliant individuals.
•	Almost 30 to 40 percent of the students of RSI have associated Physical Disabilities, especially children with Cerebral Palsy. A well qualified and experienced team of Physiotherapists helps these children to improve their posture, the range of movement of their joints, hand and eye coordination and body control with the help of different equipment and exercises, thus improving the quality of their life. These students are provided with physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, sensory integration therapy and occupational therapy.
•	Almost 50 to 60 percent of intellectually affected &amp; CP children suffer from speech problems. At Rising Sun Institute, emphasis is on Speech &amp; Language Therapy of these children, so that they can communicate freely about their needs and requirements. A team of well qualified, trained and experienced Speech Therapists helps these children to enhance their communication skills in a structured manner.
•	In order to achieve aim of making these children confident and self-reliant citizens, the Institution has a well-equipped vocational training department. Where children are imparted training of manual skills (wood work, weaving, sewing, tailoring, silk painting, block printing, dough work, sequins work etc.) 
•	Games and sports bring about positive changes in the personalities of special children. Every student is given sports coaching in different games. Students of Rising Sun have represented Pakistan in International Olympics for multiple times. since 1995 special athletes of Rising Sun have won 80 medals in international special Olympics.  

•	In order to create awareness about special needs children in general population, different seminars and workshops are held around the year. Pamphlets and brochures are also prepared about different disabilities and related issues. Rising sun Institute also holds summer internship program in month of July every year simultaneously at both of its campuses. During this internship program young girls and boys from different institutions join rising sun Institute as volunteers. This serves a dual purpose as children at rising sun Institute interact with regular age mates and make new friends.  While on the other hand the interns learn about these special people and their unique world.

[[File:Science Communication – schematic overview.png|thumb|Schematic overview of the field and the actors of science communication according to Carsten Könneker]]
'''Science communication''' is the public [[communication]] of science-related topics to non-experts. This often involves professional scientists (called "[[science outreach|outreach]]" or "[[Popularization of science|popularization]]"), but has also evolved into a [[popular science|professional field]] in its own right. It includes science exhibitions, [[Science journalism|journalism]], [[Science policy|policy]] or media production. Science communication also includes communication between scientists (for instance through [[scientific journals]]), as well as between scientists and non-scientists (especially during public controversies over science and in [[citizen science]] initiatives).
 
Science communication may generate support for [[Scientific method|scientific research]] or [[Science education|study]], or to inform [[decision making]], including [[political]] and [[ethical]] thinking. There is increasing emphasis on explaining methods rather than simply findings of science. This may be especially critical in addressing scientific [[misinformation]], which spreads easily because it is not subject to the constraints of [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=GregMiller/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hilgartner/&gt;&lt;ref name=POIOlson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krulwich/&gt;
'''Science communicators'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; can use [[entertainment]] and [[persuasion]] including [[humour]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, [[storytelling]] and [[metaphors]].&lt;ref name=POIOlson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krulwich/&gt; Scientists can be trained in some of the techniques used by [[actors]] to improve their communication.&lt;ref name=Viola/&gt;

==Motivations==
Partly due to a market for professional training, science communication is also an academic discipline. Journals include ''[[Public Understanding of Science (journal)|Public Understanding of Science]]'' and ''Science Communication''. Researchers in this field are often linked to [[Science and Technology Studies]], but may also come from [[history of science]], mainstream [[media studies]], [[psychology]] or [[sociology]]. As a reflection of growth in this field, academic departments, such as the ''Department of Life Sciences Communication'' at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], have been established to focus on applied and theoretical communication issues. [[Agricultural communication]] is considered a subset of science communication from an academic and professional standpoint relating to agriculture-related information among agricultural and non-agricultural stakeholders. [[Health communication]] is a related discipline.
Writing in 1987, Geoffery Thomas and John Durant advocated various reasons to increase public understanding of science, or [[scientific literacy]]. If the public enjoyed science more, they suggested there would presumably be more funding, progressive regulation, and trained scientists. More trained engineers and scientists could allow a nation to be more competitive economically.&lt;ref name=GregMiller&gt;As summarised in Gregory, Jane &amp; Steve Miller (1998) Science in Public: communication, culture and credibility (New York: Plenum), 11-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
Science can also benefit individuals. Science can simply have aesthetic appeal (e.g. [[popular science]] or [[science fiction]]). Living in an increasingly technological society, background scientific knowledge can help to negotiate it. The [[Positive psychology|science of happiness]] is an example of a field whose research can have direct and obvious implications for individuals.&lt;ref name=GregMiller/&gt;
Governments and societies might also benefit from more scientific literacy, since an informed electorate promotes a more [[democratic society]].&lt;ref name=GregMiller/&gt; Moreover, science can inform moral [[decision making]] (e.g. answering questions about whether [[Pain in animals|animals can feel pain]], how [[Climate change|human activity influences climate]], or even a [[science of morality]]).
[[Bernard Cohen (physicist)|Bernard Cohen]] points out potential pitfalls in improving scientific literacy. He explains first that we must avoid 'scientific idolatry'. In other words, science education must allow the public to respect science without worshiping it, or expecting infallibility. Ultimately scientists are humans, and neither perfectly altruistic, nor perfectly competent. Science communicators must also appreciate the distinction between understanding science and possessing a transferable skill of scientific thinking. Indeed, even trained scientists do not always manage to transfer the skill to other areas of their life.

Communicating science to the public is increasingly important in today's society. However according to some research, some scientists do not have the skills necessary to do so effectively. There has been some research done over why this is, and it has been found that the stereotype of scientists is the main reason they will not communicate to the public often. The "Draw a Scientist" experiment proves that from a young age, most people assume that scientists are unsocial, so scientists use that as a reason to not communicate.

Cohen is critical of what has been called "[[Scientism]]" – the claim that science is the best or only way to solve all problems. He also criticizes the teaching of 'miscellaneous information' and doubts that much of it will ever be of any use, (e.g. the distance in light years from the Earth to various stars, or the names of minerals). Much of scientific knowledge, particularly if it is not the subject of public debate and policy revision, may never really translate to practical changes for the lives of the learners.&lt;ref name=GregMiller/&gt;

Many criticisms of academic research in [[public understanding of science]] come from scholars in [[Science and Technology Studies]]. For example, Steven Hilgartner (1990)&lt;ref name=Hilgartner&gt;Hilgartner, Stephen (1990) ‘The Dominant View of Popularization: Conceptual Problems, Political Uses, Social Studies of Science, vol. 20(3): 519-539.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that what he calls 'the dominant view' of science popularization tends to imply a tight boundary around those who can articulate true, reliable knowledge. By defining a [[deficit model|deficient public]] as recipients of knowledge, the scientists get to contrast their own identity as experts. The process of popularization is a form of boundary work. Understood in this way, science communication may explicitly exist to connect scientists with the rest of society, but its very existence only acts to emphasise it: as if the scientific community only invited the public to play in order to reinforce its most powerful boundary (according to work by [[Massimiano Bucchi]] or [[Brian Wynne]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimiano Bucchi]] (1998) Science and the Media (London &amp; New York: Routledge).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wynne, Brian (1992) ‘Misunderstood misunderstanding: Social identities and public uptake of science’, ''Public Understanding of Science'', vol. 1 (3): 281-304. See also Irwin, Alan &amp; Wynne, Brian (eds) (1996) ''Misunderstanding Science'' (Cambridge &amp; New York: Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist [[Randy Olson]] adds that anti-science groups can often be so motivated, and so well funded, that the impartiality of science organizations in politics can lead to crises of public understanding of science. He cites examples of [[denialism]] (for instance of [[global warming]]) to support this worry.&lt;ref name=POIOlson&gt;(23 October 2009.)

Accessed May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Robert Krulwich]] likewise argues that the stories scientists tell are invariably competing with the efforts of people like [[Adnan Oktar]]. Krulwich explains that attractive, easy to read, and cheap [[creationist]] textbooks were sold by the thousands to schools in Turkey (despite their strong secular tradition) due to the efforts of Oktar.&lt;ref name=Krulwich&gt;Miller, Lulu (29 July 2008).[http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2008/jul/29/tell-me-a-story/ "Tell Me a Story."] (Includes podcast).

==Methods==
[[File:Physicsworks.ogv|thumb|[[Walter Lewin]] demonstrates conservation of potential energy. It can be difficult to captivatingly share good scientific thinking as well as scientifically accurate information. Krulwich and Olson believe scientists must rise to that challenge using metaphor and story telling.&lt;ref name=POIOlson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krulwich/&gt;]]

Marine biologist and film-maker [[Randy Olson]] published ''Don't Be Such a Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style''. In the book he describes how there has been this unproductive negligence when it comes to teaching scientists to communicate. ''Don't be Such a Scientist'' is written to his fellow scientists, and he says they need to "lighten up". He adds that scientists are ultimately the most responsible for promoting and explaining science to the public and media. This, Olson says, should be done according to a good grasp of [[social science]]; scientists must use [[persuasive]] and effective means like [[story telling]]. Olson acknowledges that the stories told by scientists need not only be compelling but also accurate to modern science - and says this added challenge must simply be confronted. He points to figures like [[Carl Sagan]] as effective popularizers, partly because such figures actively cultivate a likeable image.&lt;ref name=POIOlson/&gt;

Science popularization figures such as Carl Sagan and [[Neil deGrasse Tyson|Neil Degrasse Tyson]] are partly responsible for the view of science or a specific science discipline within the general public. However, the degree of knowledge and experience a science popularizer has can vary greatly. Because of this, some can depend on sensationalism. As a Forbes contributor put it, "The main job of physics popularizers is the same as it is for any celebrity: get more famous."&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Neil deGrasse Tyson's Role in the Scientific Community? |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/08/11/what-is-neil-degrasse-tysons-role-in-the-scientific-community/#17afaca875a5 |website=Forbes |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this variation in experience, research scientists can sometimes question the credibility of science popularizers. Another point in the controversy of popular science is the idea of how public debate can affect public opinion. A relevant and highly public example of this is [[climate change]]. A science communication study appearing in the New York Times proves that "even a fractious minority wields enough power to skew a reader’s perception of a [science news] story” and that even “firmly worded (but not uncivil) disagreements between commenters affected readers’ perception of science.”&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walsh |first1=Lynda |title=The Double-Edged Sword of Popularization |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1075547015581928 |website=Science Communication |publisher=SAGE Journals |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes some to worry that the popularizing of science in the public, questioning whether the further popularization of science will cause pressure towards generalization or sensationalism. Unfortunately, this question will fall to time for an answer.&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walsh |first1=Lynda |title=The Double-Edged Sword of Popularization |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1075547015581928 |website=Science Communication |publisher=SAGE Journals |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As his commencement address to [[Caltech]] students, journalist [[Robert Krulwich]] delivered a speech entitled "Tell me a story". Krulwich says that scientists are actually given many opportunities to explain something interesting about science or their work, and that they must seize such opportunities. He says scientists must resist shunning the public, as [[Sir Isaac Newton]] did in his writing, and instead embrace metaphors the way [[Galileo]] did; Krulwich suggests that metaphors only become more important as the science gets more difficult to understand. He adds that telling stories of science in practice, of scientists' success stories and struggles, helps convey that scientists are real people. Finally, Krulwich advocates for the importance of scientific values in general, and helping the public to understand that scientific views are not mere opinions, but hard-won knowledge.&lt;ref name=Krulwich/&gt;

Actor [[Alan Alda]] helps scientists and PhD students get more comfortable with communication with the help of [[drama]] coaches (they use the acting techniques of [[Viola Spolin]]).&lt;ref name=Viola&gt;Grushkin, Daniel (5 August 2010). [http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/57611/ "Try acting like a scientist"] [http://the-scientist.com/ The Scientist Magazine]. Accessed May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew Nisbet describes the use of [[Opinion leadership|opinion leaders]] as intermediaries between scientists and the public as a way to reach the public via trained individuals who are more closely engaged with their communities, such as "teachers, business leaders, attorneys, policymakers, neighborhood leaders, students, and media professionals." Examples of initiatives that take this approach include Science &amp; Engineering Ambassadors, sponsored by the [[National Academy of Sciences]], and Science Booster Clubs, coordinated by the [[National Center for Science Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nisbet |first1=Matthew |title=Ambassadors for Science: Harnessing the Power of Opinion-Leaders across Communities |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=30-31 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/ambassadors_for_science |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imagining science's publics===
In the preface of ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] wrote: "Three imaginary readers looked over my shoulder while I was writing, and I now dedicate the book to them. [...] First the general reader, the layman [...] second the expert [and] third the student".

[[File:Science &amp; Technology Fair 2011 - Kolkata 2011-02-09 0921.JPG|thumb|Students explain science projects to visitors. Susanna Hornig promotes the message that anyone can meaningfully engage with science, even without going as deeply into it as the researchers themselves do.&lt;ref name=Priest/&gt;]]

Many criticisms of the [[public understanding of science]] movement have emphasized that this thing they were calling the public was somewhat of an (unhelpful) black box. Approaches to the public changed with the move away from the public understanding of science. Science communication researchers and practitioners now often showcase their desire to listen to non-scientists as well as acknowledging an awareness of the fluid and complex nature of (post/late) modern social identities.&lt;ref&gt;for example, see Irwin, Alan &amp; Michael, Mike (2003) Science, Social Theory and Public Knowledge (Maidenhead &amp; Philadelphia: Open University Press). chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; At the very least, people will use plurals: [[publics]] or audiences. As the editor of [[Public Understanding of Science (journal)|Public Understanding of Science]] put it in a special issue on publics:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have clearly moved from the old days of the deficit frame and thinking of publics as monolithic to viewing publics as active, knowledgeable, playing multiple roles, receiving as well as shaping science. (Einsiedel, 2007: 5)&lt;ref&gt;Einsiedel, Edna (2005) ‘Editorial: Of Publics and Science’, Public Understanding of Science, vol. 16(1): 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Einsiedel goes on to suggest both views of the public are "monolithic" in their own way; they both choose to declare what something called the public is. [[Public understanding of science]] might have ridiculed publics for their ignorance, but an alternative "public engagement with science and technology" romanticizes its publics for their participatory instincts, intrinsic morality or simple collective wisdom. As Susanna Hornig Priest (2009)&lt;ref name=Priest&gt;Priest, Susanna Hornig (2009) ‘Reinterpreting the audiences for media messages about science’, in Richard Holliman et al (eds) Investigating Science Communication in the Information Age: Implications for Public Engagement and Popular Media (Oxford: Oxford University Press) 223-236.&lt;/ref&gt; concludes in her recent introduction essay on science’s contemporary audiences, the job of science communication might be to help non-scientists feel they are not excluded as opposed to always included; that they can join in if they want, rather than that there is a necessity to spend their lives engaging.

The process of quantifiably surveying public opinion of science is now largely associated with the [[public understanding of science]] movement (some would say unfairly&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bauer, Nick Allum and Steve Miller, "What can we learn from 25 years of PUS survey research? Liberating and expanding the agenda", ''[[Public Understanding of Science (journal)|Public Understanding of Science]]'', volume 16, 2007, pages 79-95.&lt;/ref&gt;). In the US, Jon Miller is the name most associated with such work and well known for differentiating between identifiable ‘attentive’ or ‘interested’ publics (that is to say science fans) and those who do not care much about science and technology. Miller’s work questioned whether the American public had the following four attributes of scientific literacy:
* knowledge of basic textbook scientific factual knowledge
* an understanding of scientific method
* appreciated the positive outcomes of science and technology
* rejected superstitious beliefs, such as astrology or numerology&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bauer, Nick Allum and Steve Miller, "What can we learn from 25 years of PUS survey research? Liberating and expanding the agenda", ''[[Public Understanding of Science (journal)|Public Understanding of Science]]'', volume 16, 2007, pages 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some respects, John Durant’s work surveying British public&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Durant, John, GA Evans &amp; GP Thomas (1989) ‘The Public Understanding of Science’, Nature 340: 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt; applied similar ideas to Miller. However, they were slightly more concerned with attitudes to science and technology, rather than just how much knowledge people had. They also looked at public confidence in their knowledge, considering issues such as the gender of those ticking "don’t know" boxes. We can see aspects of this approach, as well as a more "public engagement with science and technology" influenced one, reflected within the [[Eurobarometer]] studies of public opinion. These have been running since 1973 to monitor public opinion in the member states, with the aim of helping the preparation of policy (and evaluation of policy). They look at a host of topics, not just science and technology but also defence, the [[euro]], enlargement of the European Union, and culture. Eurobarometer’s recent study of Europeans’ Attitudes to Climate Change&lt;ref&gt;(September 2008.) [http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_300_full_en.pdf "Europeans’ attitudes towards climate change."] European Parliament and European Commission (accessed in May 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; is a good example. It focuses on respondents’ "subjective level of information"; asking "personally, do you think that you are well informed or not about…?" rather than checking what people knew.

===Frame analysis===
Science communication can be analysed through [[frame analysis]], a research method used to analyse how people understand situations and activities.

Some features of this analysis are listed below.
* '''Public accountability''': placing a blame on public actions for value, e.g. political gain in the climate change debate
* '''Runaway technology''': creating a certain view of technological advancements, e.g. photos of an exploded nuclear power plant
* '''Scientific uncertainty''': questioning the reliability of a scientific theory, e.g. arguing how bad global climate change can be if humans are still alive&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Nisbet, Matthew C. (2009). Communicating Climate Change: Why Frames Matter for Public Engagement. Environment (Online at http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/March-April%202009/Nisbet-full.html, retrieved 20 October 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heuristics ===
People make an enormous number of decisions every day, and to approach all of them in a careful, methodical manner is impractical. They therefore often use mental shortcuts known as "[[heuristic]]s" to quickly arrive at acceptable inferences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Fiske, S. T., &amp; Taylor, S. E. (1991). ''Social Cognition'' (2nd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amos Tversky|Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman]] originally proposed three heuristics, listed below, although there are many others that have been discussed in later research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Amos|last2=Kahneman|first2=Daniel|date=27 September 1974|title=Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/185/4157/1124|journal=Science|volume=185|issue=4157|pages=1124–1131|doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17835457}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Representativeness heuristic|'''Representativeness''']]: used to make assumptions about probability based on relevancy, e.g. how likely item A is to be a member of category B (is Kim a chef?), or that event C resulted from process D (could the sequence of coin tosses H-H-T-T have occurred randomly?).
* [[Availability heuristic|'''Availability''']]: used to estimate how frequent or likely an event is based on how quickly one can conjure examples of the event. For example, if one were asked to approximate the number of people in your age group that are currently in college, your judgment would be affected by how many of your own acquaintances are in college.
* [[Anchoring|'''Anchoring and adjustment''']]: used when making judgments with uncertainties. One will start with an anchoring point, then adjust it to reach an assumption. For example, if you are asked to estimate how many people will take Dr. Smith's biology class this spring, you may recall that 38 students took the class in the fall, and adjust your estimation based on whether the class is more popular in the spring or in the fall.
The most effective science communication efforts take into account the role that heuristics play in everyday decision-making. Many outreach initiatives focus solely on increasing the public's knowledge, but studies (e.g. Brossard et al. 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brossard|first=Dominique|last2=Lewenstein|first2=Bruce|last3=Bonney|first3=Rick|date=1 January 2005|title=Scientific knowledge and attitude change: The impact of a citizen science project|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500690500069483|journal=International Journal of Science Education|volume=27|issue=9|pages=1099–1121|doi=10.1080/09500690500069483|issn=0950-0693}}&lt;/ref&gt; have found that there is little – if any – correlation between knowledge levels and attitudes towards scientific issues.&lt;ref&gt;Scheufele, D. A. (2006). Messages and heuristics: How audiences form attitudes about emerging technologies. In J. Turney (Ed.), Engaging science: Thoughts, deeds, analysis and action (pp. 20-25). London: The Wellcome Trust.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Simulation ====
{{Main|Simulation heuristic}}

The simulation heuristic is used to judge how likely certain outcomes are based on the ease with which one can imagine a particular ending.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This heuristic can be used for many tasks, including prediction (Will the Jets win this football game?) and causality (Did Jim eat the last slice of pizza?). An application of this heuristic is to the case of near misses. Consider the following example from Kahneman &amp; Tversky:&lt;ref&gt;Kahneman, D. &amp; Tversky, A. (1981). ''The simulation heuristic''. (Report No. 5). Retrieved from http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA099504&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Crane and Mr. Tees were scheduled to leave the airport on different flights, at the same time. They traveled from town in the same limousine, were caught in a traffic jam, and arrived at the airport thirty minutes after the scheduled departure time of their flights.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Crane is told his flight left on time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Tees is told that his flight was delayed, and just left five minutes ago.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Who is more upset?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Crane or Mr. Tees?&lt;/blockquote&gt;Almost everyone says, "Mr. Tees", because they cannot imagine how Mr. Crane could have caught his flight, while Mr. Tees might have made it if not for that slow pedestrian, or the exceptionally long security line. The simulation heuristic has this ability to generate "if only" conditions, which can be used to understand the negative feelings of frustration, indignation, etc. that arise from near misses such as that of Mr. Tees.

This simulation of how events ''might'' have occurred is referred to as [[counterfactual thinking]], and can be used to try to identify a unique or unusual circumstance that lead to a dramatic outcome. For example, consider a man who is shot during a robbery while shopping at a convenience store. Subjects will award more damages to a man who was shopping at a store far from his house than they will to a man who was shopping at a store near his home that he commonly visits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Regarding simulations of future events, simply imagining hypothetical events makes them seem more likely to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sparks|first=Paul|last2=Harris|first2=Peter R.|last3=Raats|first3=Monique|date=1 April 2003|title=Imagining and Explaining Hypothetical Scenarios: Mediational Effects on the Subjective Likelihood of Health-Related Outcomes1|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2003.tb01929.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|volume=33|issue=4|pages=869–887|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2003.tb01929.x|issn=1559-1816}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gregory|first=W.

== Science in popular culture and the media ==

[[File:Light_bulb_Edison_2.jpg|thumb|This diagram, designed by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1880, is intended to depict the workings of a [[Electric light|light bulb]].|alt=The diagram, designed by Thomas Edison in 1880, is intended to depict the workings of a light bulb.]]

=== Birth of public science ===
While scientific study began to emerge as a popular discourse following the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], science was not widely funded or exposed to the public until the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/who_pays|title=Who pays for science?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.berkeley.edu|publisher=Berkeley University|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most science prior to this was funded by individuals under private [[patronage]] and was studied in exclusive groups, like the [[Royal Society]]. [[Public science]] emerged due to a gradual [[Marxism|social change]], resulting from the rise of the middle class in the nineteenth century. As scientific inventions, like the [[conveyor belt]] and the [[steam locomotive]] entered and enhanced the lifestyle of people in the nineteenth century, scientific inventions began to be widely funded by [[University|universities]] and other public institutions in an effort to increase scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/science.html|title=Science Technology Timeline|last=|first=|date=2002|website=www.victorianweb.org|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since scientific achievements were beneficial to society, the pursuit of scientific knowledge resulted in science as a [[profession]]. Scientific institutions, like the [[National Academy of Sciences]] or the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]] are examples of leading platforms for the public discussion of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/baas.htm|title=BAAS|last=|first=|date=2002|website=www.victorianweb.org|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Brewster]], founder of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, believed in regulated publications in order to effectively communicate their discoveries, "so that scientific students may know where to begin their labours."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/history|title=British Science Association History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.britishscienceassociation.org|publisher=British Science Association|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the communication of science reached a wider audience, due to the [[professionalization]] of science and its introduction to the [[public sphere]], the interest in the subject increased.

=== Scientific media in the 19th century ===
There was a change in media production in the nineteenth century. The invention of the [[Steam engine|steam-powered]] [[printing press]] enabled more pages to be printed per hour, which resulted in cheaper texts. Book prices gradually dropped, which gave the [[working class]]es the ability to purchase them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/religion/fyfe.html#audience|title=A Review of Aileen Fyfe's Science and Salvation: Evangelical Popular Science Publishing in Victorian Britain|last=Landow|first=George P.|date=25 May 2005|website=www.victorianweb.org|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; No longer reserved for the elite, affordable and informative texts were made available to a mass audience. Historian Aileen Fyfe noted that, as the nineteenth century experienced a set of [[:Category:19th-century reform movements|social reforms]] that sought to improve the lives of those in the working classes, the availability of public knowledge was valuable for intellectual growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/sci_publishing.html|title=Science Publishing|last=Fyfe|first=Aileen|date=|website=www.victorianweb.org|publisher=National University of Ireland|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there were reform efforts to further the knowledge of the less educated. The [[Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge]], led by [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]], attempted to organize a system for widespread literacy for all classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/theme/59807?backToResults=%2Fsearch%2Frefine%2F%3FdocStart=1%26themesTabShow=true|title=Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (act. 1826–1846)|last=Ashton|first=Rosemary|date=|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, weekly [[Periodical literature|periodicals]], like the ''[[Penny Magazine]]'', were aimed to educate the general public on scientific achievements in a comprehensive manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ThePennyMagazineOfTheSocietyForTheDiffusionOfUsefulKnowledge|title=The Penny Magazine of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|last=Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|first=|date=2012|website=archive.org|publisher=archive.org|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Koenig's steam press - 1814.png|left|thumb|[[Friedrich Koenig|Fredrich Koenig]]'s stream powered [[printing press]], 1814.]]
As the audience for scientific texts expanded, the interest in public science did as well. 'Extension lectures' were installed in some universities, like [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]], which encouraged members of the public to attend lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/history/nineteenth-and-twentieth-centuries|title=About the University: Nineteenth and twentieth centuries|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Cambridge|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In America, travelling lectures were a common occurrence in the nineteenth century and attracted hundreds of viewers. These [[public lecture]]s were a part of the [[lyceum movement]] and demonstrated basic [[Experiment|scientific experiments]], which advanced scientific knowledge for both the educated and uneducated viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dh.dickinson.edu/digitalmuseum/exhibit-artifact/making-the-invisible-visible/showing-scientific-lecturing-19th-century|title=Showing off: Scientific Lecturing in the 19th century|last=|first=|date=|website=The Dickinsonia History Project|publisher=Dickinson College|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only did the popularization of [[public science]] enlighten the general public through [[mass media]], but it also enhanced communication within the [[scientific community]]. Although scientists had been communicating their discoveries and achievements through print for centuries, publications with a variety of subjects decreased in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/sci_publishing.html|title=Science Publishing|last=Fyfe|first=Aileen|date=|website=|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, publications in discipline-specific journals were crucial for a successful career in the sciences in the nineteenth century. As a result, [[scientific journal]]s such as [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] or [[National Geographic (magazine)|''National Geographic'']] possessed a large readership and received substantial funding by the end of the nineteenth century as the popularization of science continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making "Nature": The History of a Scientific Journal|last=Brown|first=Melinda|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0226261454|location=Chicago, USA|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communication of science in contemporary media ===
Science can be communicated to the public in many different ways. According to Karen Bultitude, a science communication lecturer at [[University College London]], these can be broadly categorised into three groups: traditional journalism, live or face-to-face events, and online interaction.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/staff/bultitude/KB_TB/Karen_Bultitude_-_Science_Communication_Why_and_How.pdf|title=The Why and How of Science Communication|last=Bultitude|first=Karen|date=2011|website=|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813110819/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/staff/bultitude/KB_TB/Karen_Bultitude_-_Science_Communication_Why_and_How.pdf|archivedate=13 August 2012|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional [[journalism]] (for example, [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[television]] and [[radio]]) has the advantage of reaching large audiences; in the past, this is way most people regularly accessed information about science.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/sri-pas-2011-main-report.pdf|title=Public Attitudes to Science 2011|last=Ipsos-MORI|first=|date=2011|website=|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721050636/https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/sri-pas-2011-main-report.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional media is also more likely to produce information that is high quality (well written or presented), as it will have been produced by professional journalists. Traditional journalism is often also responsible for setting agendas and having an impact on government [[policy]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The traditional journalistic method of communication is one-way, so there can be no dialogue with the public, and science stories can often be reduced in scope so that there is a limited focus for a mainstream audience, who may not be able to comprehend the bigger picture from a scientific perspective.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; However, there is new research now available on the role of newspapers and television channels in constituting 'scientific public spheres' which enable participation of a wide range of actors in public deliberations.&lt;ref&gt;Shiju Sam Varughese.2017. ''Contested Knowledge: Science, Media, and Democracy in Kerala''. Oxford University Press, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another disadvantage of traditional journalism is that, once a science story is taken up by mainstream media, the scientist(s) involved no longer has any direct control over how his or her work is communicated, which may lead to misunderstanding or misinformation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCartney|first=Margaret|date=25 January 2016|title=Margaret McCartney: Who gains from the media’s misrepresentation of science?|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i355|journal=BMJ|volume=352|pages=i355|doi=10.1136/bmj.i355|issn=1756-1833|pmid=26810502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this area demonstrates how the relationship between journalists and scientists has been strained in some instances.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dudo|first=Anthony|date=1 September 2015|title=Scientists, the Media, and the Public Communication of Science|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/soc4.12298|journal=Sociology Compass|volume=9|issue=9|pages=761–775|doi=10.1111/soc4.12298|issn=1751-9020}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand scientists have reported being frustrated with things like journalists oversimplifying or dramatizing of their work, while on the other hand journalists find scientists difficult to work with and ill-equipped to communicate their work to a general audience.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/962750268|title=The Oxford handbook of the science of science communication|others=Jamieson, Kathleen Hall,, Kahan, Dan M.,, Scheufele, Dietram,|isbn=9780190497620|location=New York, NY, United States of America|oclc=962750268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Despite this potential tension, a comparison of scientists from several countries has shown that many scientists are pleased with their media interactions and engage often.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peters|first=Hans Peter|last2=Brossard|first2=Dominique|last3=Cheveigné|first3=Suzanne de|last4=Dunwoody|first4=Sharon|last5=Kallfass|first5=Monika|last6=Miller|first6=Steve|last7=Tsuchida|first7=Shoji|date=11 July 2008|title=Interactions with the Mass Media|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5886/204|journal=Science|volume=321|issue=5886|pages=204–205|doi=10.1126/science.1157780|issn=0036-8075|pmid=18625578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is important to note the use of traditional media sources, like [[newspaper]]s and [[television]], has steadily declined as primary sources for science information, while the internet has rapidly increased in prominence.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsb20181/|title=S&amp;E Indicators 2018 {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, over half of Americans (55 percent) reported using the internet as their primary source to learn about science and technology, compared to 24 percent reporting TV and 4 percent reporting newspapers were their primary sources.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Additionally, traditional media outlets have dramatically decreased the number of, or in some cases eliminated, science journalists and the amount of science-related content they publish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23674|title=Communicating Science Effectively: A Research Agenda|last=Agenda|first=Committee on the Science of Science Communication: A Research|last2=Education|first2=Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and|last3=Sciences|first3=National Academies of|last4=Engineering|last5=Medicine|first5=and|date=13 December 2016|isbn=9780309451024|doi=10.17226/23674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second category is live or face-to-face events, such as public lectures (for example, [http://events.ucl.ac.uk/calendar/tab:lunch_hour_lectures/ UCL's public lunch hour lectures] – [[museum]]s, [[debate]]s, [http://www.sciencemadesimple.co.uk/shows/busking science busking], [http://www.sciartcenter.org/ sci-art], [http://www.sciencecafes.org/ science cafes] and [[science festival]]s. [[Citizen science|Citizen Science]] or crowd-sourced science (scientific research conducted, in whole or in part, by amateur or nonprofessional scientists), which can be done with a face-to-face approach, online, or as a combination of the two to engage in science communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Research has shown that members of the public seek out science information that is entertaining, but also helping citizens to critically participate in risk regulation and S&amp;T governance.&lt;ref&gt;Shiju Sam Varughese. 2017. ''Contested Knowledge: Science, Media, and Democracy in Kerala''. Oxford University Press, New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore it is important to bear this aspect in mind when communicating scientific information to the public (for example, through events combining science communication and comedy, such as [http://festivalofthespokennerd.com/ Festival of the Spoken Nerd] or during scientific controversies).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The advantages of this approach are that it is more personal and allows scientists to interact with the public, allowing for two-way dialogue. Scientists are also better able to control content using this method. Disadvantages of this method include the limited reach, it can also be resource-intensive and costly and also, it may be that only audiences with an existing interest in science will be attracted.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The third category is online interaction, for example, [[website]]s, [[blog]]s, [[wiki]]s and [[podcast]]s can also be used for science communication, as can other [[social media]]. Online methods of communicating science have the potential to reach huge audiences, can allow direct interaction between scientists and the public,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Könneker|first=Carsten|last2=Lugger|first2=Beatrice |date=4 October 2013|title= Public Science 2.0 – Back to the Future |url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/49 |journal=Science|volume=342|issue= 6154|pages=49–50|doi= 10.1126/science.1245848|issn=0036-8075|pmid=24092719}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the content is always accessible and can be somewhat controlled by the scientist. Additionally, online communication of science can help boost scientists' reputation through increased citations, better circulation of articles, and establishing new collaborations.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Online communication also allows for both one-way and two-way communication, depending on the audience’s and the author's preferences. However, there are disadvantages in that it is difficult to control how content is picked up by others, and regular attention and updating is needed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

When considering whether or not to engage in science communication online, scientists should review what science communication research has shown to be the potential positive and negative outcomes. Online communication has given rise to movements like [[open science]], which advocates for making science more accessible. However, when engaging in communication about science online, scientists should consider not publicizing or reporting findings from their research until it has been peer-reviewed and published, as journals may not accept the work after it has been circulated under the "[[Ingelfinger rule]]".

Other considerations revolve around how scientsts will be perceived by other scientists for engaging in communication. For example, some scholars have criticized engaged, popular scholars using concepts like the [[Sagan effect]] or [[Kardashian Index]]. Despite these criticisms, many scientists are taking to communicating their work on online platforms, a sign of potentially changing norms in the field.[https://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/40992/title/Science-Gone-Social/]

=== The effects of Twitter and other social media on scientific communication ===
By using [[Twitter]], researchers and academics can discuss and communicate scientific topics with many types of audiences based on various points of view.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/social-media-in-science_us_57c8fbcde4b07addc411f6ec|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180608005909/https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/social-media-in-science_us_57c8fbcde4b07addc411f6ec|dead-url=no|archivedate=8 June 2018|title=Social Media in Science|last=Ramasubbu|first=Suren|date=12 September 2016|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies indicate that the use of Twitter can positively impact the number of times a scientific article is cited. These studies show that articles that are highly tweeted about are eleven times more likely to be highly cited than those that who few people tweeted.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/haydnshaughnessy/2012/01/15/how-could-twitter-influence-science-and-why-scientists-are-on-board/#778c777718be.|title=How Could Twitter Influence Science (And Why Scientists Are on Board)|last=Shaughnessy|first=Haydn|date=17 January 2012|website=Forbes|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted in studies by [[Gunther Eysenbach]], research has shed light on how Twitter has a direct link to the advances in the science community.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Alison Burt, Editor in chief of Elsevier Connect and author of the article ''How to use social media for science,'' states the potential drawbacks to sharing their research on Twitter.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/connect/how-to-use-social-media-for-science|title=How to use social media for science - 3 views|last=Burt|first=Alison|date=|website=Elsevier|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kimberly Collins of [[PLOS]] explains reasons how some scientists are hesitant to join Twitter.&lt;ref name=collins&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Kimberley|last2=Shiffman|first2=David|last3=Rock|first3=Jenny|date=12 October 2016|title=How Are Scientists Using Social Media in the Workplace?|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0162680|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=10|pages=e0162680|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0162680|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists are hesitant to use social media outlets such as Twitter due to lack of knowledge of the platform, and inexperience with how to make meaningful posts.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt; Some scientists do not see the meaning in using Twitter as a platform to share their research or have the time to add the information into the accounts themselves.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt;

Scientists also believe that Twitter is not professional enough for them to put out information as well as receive relevant suggestions and comments back.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Scientists did give a positive to using Twitter by (28%) of the scientists who participated in the study said communicating science on Twitter can benefit because of the size and diverse audience it reaches.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt; BoingBoing science editor and [[The New York Times|New York Times]] columnist [[Maggie Koerth-Baker]] commented on the importance of keeping public and private personas on social media separate in order to maintain professionalism online.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; According to these findings, posting academic research on a personal social media accounts could potentially send mixed messages to Twitter users.

There have been occasions where scientific outreach on Twitter has been met with positive results. In September 2017, an 8 year old bug lover was teased at her school for her passion for bugs.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/an-8-year-old-bullied-for-her-love-of-bugs-just-got-her-first-scientific-publication|title=An 8-Year-Old Bullied For Her Love of Bugs Just Got Her First Scientific Publication|last=Dean|first=Signe|work=ScienceAlert|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the [[Entomological Society of Canada|Entomological society of Canada]] posting a tweet defending her love for bugs called #BugsR4Girls.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The ESC’s use of twitter was able to make a statement saying, "A young girl who loves insects is being bullied &amp; needs our support. DM your email &amp; we'll connect you! #BugsR4Girls".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In 2017, a study done by the [[Pew Research Center]] of Journalism and Media found that "About a quarter of social media users follow science related pages and accounts.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalism.org/2017/09/20/science-news-and-information-today/|title=Science News and Information Today|date=2017-09-20|work=Pew Research Center's Journalism Project|accessdate=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group places both more importance and comparatively more trust on science news that comes to them through social media".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Karen Peterson, director of Scientific Career Development at [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center|Fred Hutchinson Cancer research Center]] stresses the "importance of using social networks such as [[Facebook]] and Twitter to engage in intercommunication" for establishing an online presence as well.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/features/2014/02/scientists-guide-social-media|title=A scientist's guide to social media|date=14 November 2017|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online presence is necessary for career development. No matter your personality type, career advisors recommend that postdocs use online networking tools to make connections, exchange scientific ideas, and advance a career.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

According to [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], "more than 3,000 scientists and engineers told Nature about their awareness of various giant social media networks and research-profiling sites".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Elena Milani created the SciHashtag project which is a condensed collection of Twitter hashtags regarding science communication and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sagepus.blogspot.com/2016/10/scihashtag-twitter-hashtag-science.html|title=SciHashtag: Twitter hashtags for scientists|last=Underst|first=Public|last2=Science|first2=ing of|website=Public Understanding of Science Blog|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter has become a part of researchers’ lives.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== The public understanding of science movement ==
The [[public understanding of science]], public awareness of science and public engagement with science and technology are all terms coined with a movement involving governments and societies in the late 20th century. During the late 19th century, science became a professional subject and influenced by governmental suggestions. Prior to this, public understanding of science was very low on the agenda. However, some well-known figures such as [[Michael Faraday]] ran lectures aimed at the non-expert public, his being the famous [[Christmas Lectures]] which began in 1825. The 20th century saw groups founded on the basis they could position science in a broader cultural context and allow scientists to communicate their knowledge in a way that could reach and be understood by the general public. In the UK, ''The Bodmer Report'' (or ''The Public Understanding of Science'' as it is more formally known) published in 1985 by [[The Royal Society]] changed the way scientists communicated their work to the public. The report was designed to "review the nature and extent of the public understanding of science in the United Kingdom and its adequacy for an advanced democracy.".&lt;ref name=gregory2000&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science in Public|last=Gregory|first=Jane|last2=Miller|first2=Steven|publisher=Ingram Digital|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=5–7|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaired by the geneticist Sir Walter Bodmer alongside famous scientists such as broadcaster [[Sir David Attenborough]], the report was evidenced by all of the major sectors concerned; [[scientists]], [[politicians]], [[journalists]] and [[industrialists]] but not the [[Public|general public]].&lt;ref name=gregory2000/&gt; One of the main assumptions drawn from the report was everybody should have some grasp of science and this should be introduced from a young age by teachers who are suitably qualified in the subject area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Short|first=Daniel|year=2013|title=The public understanding of science: 30 years of the Bodmer Report|journal=The School Science Review|volume=95|pages=39–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also asked for further [[media coverage]] of science including via [[newspapers]] and [[television]] which has ultimately led to the establishment of platforms such as the [[Vega Science Trust]].

In both the UK and the [[United States]] following the [[second world war]], public views of scientists swayed from great praise to resentment. Therefore, the Bodmer Report highlighted concerns from the scientific community that their withdrawal from society was causing [[scientific research]] funding to be weak.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/sri-pas-2011-main-report.pdf|title=Public Attitudes to Science 2011|last=Ipsos-MORI|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721050636/https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/sri-pas-2011-main-report.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bodmer promoted the communication of science to a wider more general public by expressing to British scientists that it was their responsibility to publicise their research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An upshot of the publication of the report was the creation of the [[Committee on the Public Understanding of Science]] (COPUS), a collaboration between the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], the [[Royal Society]] and the [[Royal Institution]]. The engagement between these individual societies caused the necessity for a public understanding of science movement to be taken seriously. COPUS also awarded grants for specific outreach activities allowing the public understanding to come to the fore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bodmer|first=Walter|date=20 September 2010|title=Public Understanding of Science: The BA, the Royal Society and COPUS|url=http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/64/Suppl_1/S151|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society|volume=64|issue=Suppl 1|pages=S151–S161|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2010.0035|issn=0035-9149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately leading to a cultural shift in the way scientists publicised their work to the wider non-expert community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/38/3805.htm#n26|title=Science and Technology; Third Review|last=|first=|date=|website=parliament.uk|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although COPUS no longer exists within the UK the name has been adopted in the US by the [[Coalition on the Public Understanding of Science|Coalition for the Public Understanding of Science]]. An organisation which is funded by the [[US National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[National Science Foundation]] and focuses on popular science projects such as science cafes, festivals, magazines and [[citizen science]] schemes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8737">"'''Second Superpower'''" is a term used to conceptualize a global [[civil society]] as a world force comparable to or counterbalancing the [[United States|United States of America]]. The term originates from a 2003 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article which described world [[public opinion]] as one of two [[superpower]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/17/world/threats-and-responses-news-analysis-a-new-power-in-the-streets.html|title=A New Power In the Streets|date=17 February 2003|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been applied by scholars to the possibility that the [[China|People's Republic of China]] could [[China as an emerging superpower|emerge]] as a "second superpower," with [[Power (international relations)|global power]] and influence on par with the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=g5s_uDDZSjoC&amp;pg=PA155&amp;dq=china+%22Second+Superpower%22|title=History of International Broadcasting|publisher=|isbn=9780852969205|author1=Wood|first1=James|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PIRkvshH5NYC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=china+%22Second+Superpower%22|title=Contemporary China|publisher=|isbn=9780415343206|author1=Dillon|first1=Michael|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6ubh-K1gBooC&amp;pg=PT563&amp;dq=china+%22Second+Superpower%22|title=American Government and Politics Today: The Essentials 2009 - 2010 Edition|publisher=|isbn=0495571709|author1=Bardes|first1=Barbara|last2=Shelley|first2=Mack|last3=Schmidt|authorlink3=Steffen Schmidt|first3=Steffen|date=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Invention in response to February 2003 demonstrations ==
[[Image:London anti-war protest banners.jpg|thumb|right|Anti-war protests which were the impetus for the invention of the term.]]
On [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|February 15, 2003]] global demonstrations took place against the impending [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]].  These involved between six and thirty million people and were listed in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as including the largest anti-war rally in history.  In reaction, ''[[New York Times]]'' writer Patrick Tyler wrote in a February 17 article that:
:{{cquote|...the huge anti-war demonstrations around the world this weekend are reminders that there may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion.}}

== Popularization as a description of popular opinion ==
The New York Times article was widely circulated in the [[peace movement]] during February 2003, adding to the hope among many participants that galvanizing world public opinion could prevent the [[Iraq War]].

[[UN]] Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] began to use the phrase "two superpowers" in speeches.  In March, "[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]" magazine cover story was titled "The Other Superpower". In it, [[Jonathan Schell]] wrote:
:{{cquote|The new superpower possesses immense power, but it is a different kind of power: not the will of one man wielding the 21,000-pound [[MOAB]] but the hearts and wills of the majority of the world's people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20030414/schell]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though worldwide popular opposition failed to prevent the invasion of Iraq, leading some to reject the notion, the phrase is still popular among people in the [[anti-war]] and [[anti-globalization]] movements.

== Application to Internet-based activism ==
On March 31, 2003, Dr. [[James F. Moore]] of [[Harvard Law School]]'s [[Berkman Center for Internet and Society]] posted an essay entitled ''The Second Superpower Rears Its Beautiful Head''.  In it, he advocated four ideas: embrace the concept explicitly within the peace movement as an inspirational goal and a counter to the "first superpower" idea promoted by the Bush administration, continue to develop blogging and other means of linking the community globally, find ways to influence first superpower institutions including international institutions and international law, and continue to develop reflective personal consciousness so as to be able to lead from love rather than fear.
:{{cquote|Overall, what can be said for the prospects of the second superpower?  With its mind enhanced by Internet connective tissue, and international law as a venue to work with others for progressive action, the second superpower is starting to demonstrate its potential.  But there is much to do.  How do we assure that it continues to gain in strength?  And at least as important, how do we continue to develop the mind of the second superpower, so that it maximizes wisdom and goodwill? The future, as they say,is in our hands.  We need to join together to help the second superpower, itself, grow stronger.}}

This paper received 50,000 downloads in five days.  The substance of the piece was debated by a number of authors, including [[Jonathan Rauch]] writing in ''[[National Journal]]''.  Many bloggers linked the paper with [[Joi Ito]]'s ''[[Emergent Democracy]]'' concept and paper.

Some attacked Moore's use of the term to describe primarily the effect of the [[Internet]]. Brian Fitzgerald argued in the [[Greenpeace]] Weblog:
:{{cquote|Moore's essay hijacks a powerful, apt description of the anti-war movement, this particular anti-war movement, and boils every bit of life out of it, turning the phrase into a highly saccharin, American, depoliticized vision of a zippy web community. There's no edge, no conflict, and the essay seems to occupy that dreamy space which considers itself radical-left but has no real argument with anybody, and no real agenda other than to pat itself on the back. It sits effortlessly in the status quo, claiming the mantle of opposition not by action or hard personal choice, but by right of enlightenment and membership in a club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weblog.greenpeace.org/archives/000353.html|title=Making Waves|work=Greenpeace International}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==="Googlewashing"===
Moore's paper was the subject of an attack on the dissemination process and the relationship of the author and his reviewers to Google, by [[Andrew Orlowski]] of [[The Register]]. Orlowski accused a small number of webloggers of "[[Googlewashing]]", a word Orlowski invented to describe [[media manipulation]] of Google to neuter the political significance of the word.  He argued:
:{{cquote|Although it took millions of people around the world to compel the Gray Lady to describe the anti-war movement as a "Second Superpower", it took only a handful of webloggers to spin the alternative meaning to manufacture sufficient PageRank to flood Google with Moore's alternative, neutered definition... Indeed, if you were wearing your Google-goggles, and the search engine was your primary view of the world, you would have a hard time believing that the phrase "Second Superpower" ever meant anything else. To all intents and purposes, the original meaning has been erased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/04/03/antiwar_slogan_coined_repurposed/|title=Anti-war slogan coined, repurposed and Googlewashed … in 42 days|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3814">The '''Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998''' ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/30/contents c 30]) was enacted by the [[United Kingdom Parliament]] on 16 July 1998. It enabled universities to charge [[Tuition fees in the United Kingdom|tuition fees]], and established statutory [[General Teaching Council (disambiguation)|General Teaching Council]]s (GTC's) for England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the modification the remit of the [[General Teaching Council for Scotland]]. The act also made provision for the new system of [[Student loans#United Kingdom|student loans]] that were introduced, and introduces paid leave from work for training towards a qualification. The passing of this act repealed the Education (Student Loans) Act 1998, and the sections relating to student finance in the Education Act 1996. The student loans system was later updated in the [[Higher Education Act 2004]].

The Teaching and Higher Education Act is divided into four parts, which can be summarised as follows:

==Part one==
===Chapter One===
*General Teaching Councils will be established in England, Wales and Northern Ireland
*Duty of GTC Scotland towards disabled persons and the representation of [[Special education in the United Kingdom|Special needs]] teachers
*Teachers at maintained schools in the UK are required to register with their GTC
*Teachers must abide by the [[General Teaching Council for England|GTC for England Code of Conduct]] and the [[General Teaching Council for Wales|GTC for Wales Code of Conduct]]

===Chapter Two===
*Headteachers in schools in England and Wales (with some exceptions) must have a professional headship qualification.
*This chapter also makes provision for the inspection of teacher training institutions.

===Chapter Three===
*All [[Newly Qualified Teacher]]s in the England and Wales are required to pass an [[Induction (teachers)|induction period]] of three school terms (one school year). At the end of this period the headteacher is required to make a recommendation to the appropriate body as to whether the new teacher has achieved the standards set by the GTC.

==Part two==
*This section outlines, in very broad terms, the system of student loans in the UK. A non-governmental body was set up in 1989 (see [[Student Loans Company]]) to administer the awarding and recovery of these loans. The Student Loans Company is not directly mentioned in this section however; the statute only calls for the Secretary of State to administer these loans.

==Part Three==
*An insert to the [[Employment Rights Act 1996]] which states that any employee who is 16 or 17, and not in full-time education, and 'has not attained such standard of achievement as is prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State', is entitled to take time off their working hours to undertake training for a qualification.
* 'An employee who is permitted to take time off...is entitled to be paid remuneration by his employer for the time taken off at the appropriate hourly rate'

==Part Four==
*Miscellaneous additions, including the re-affirmation that the only educational services in the UK allowed to use the title 'University' are those that are authorised by act of parliament or by [[Royal Charter]], or have been approved by the [[Privy Council]].

The '''University of New Hampshire''' ('''UNH''') is a [[public research university]] in the [[University System of New Hampshire]], in the United States. The university's [[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham]] campus, comprising six colleges, is located in the [[Seacoast Region (New Hampshire)|Seacoast region]] of the state. A seventh college, the [[University of New Hampshire at Manchester]], occupies the university's campus in [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]], the state's largest city. The [[University of New Hampshire School of Law]], known as the [[Franklin Pierce Law Center]] until 2010, is located in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], the state's capital.

The University of New Hampshire was founded and incorporated in 1866, as a [[land grant college]]  in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]] in connection with [[Dartmouth College]]. In 1893, UNH moved to [[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham]].

With over 15,000 students between its Durham, Manchester, and Concord campuses, UNH is the largest university in the state. UNH is one of only a few universities that is designated a [[Land-grant university|land-]], [[Sea grant colleges|sea-]], and [[Space grant college|space-grant]] institution. The university's current President is [[James W. Dean Jr.]], the 20th President of the University, who took over from [[Mark Huddleston]] on June 30, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/news/release/2018/04/04/james-w-dean-jr-named-20th-president-university-new-hampshire|title=James W.

== History ==
[[File:Thompson Hall, UNH Sunset.jpg|thumb|[[Thompson Hall (University of New Hampshire)|Thompson Hall]], built in 1892, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].]] 
[[File:Morrill Hall, UNH.jpg|thumb|right|Morrill Hall c. 1920]]
[[File:Durham NH 001.jpg|thumb|Pettee Hall c. 2005]]
The [[Morrill Act]] of 1862 granted federal lands to New Hampshire for the establishment of an agricultural-mechanical college. In 1866, the university was first incorporated as the '''[[New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts]]''' in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], in association with [[Dartmouth College]]. The institution was officially associated with Dartmouth College and was directed by Dartmouth's president. Durham resident [[Benjamin Thompson (farmer)|Benjamin Thompson]] left his farm and assets to the state for the establishment of an agricultural college. On January 30, 1890, Benjamin Thompson died and his will became public. On March 5, 1891 Gov. Hiram Americus Tuttle signed an act accepting the conditions of Thompson's will. On April 10, 1891, Gov. Tuttle signed a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] authorizing the college's move to [[Durham, New Hampshire]].

In 1892, the Board of Trustees hired [[Charles Eliot (landscape architect)|Charles Eliot]] to draw a site plan for the first five campus buildings: Thompson, Conant, Nesmith, and Hewitt Shops (now called Halls) and the Dairy Barn. Eliot visited Durham and worked for three months to create a plan prior to the move to Durham. The Class of 1892, excited about the pending move to Durham, held commencement exercises in an unfinished barn on the Durham campus. On April 18, 1892, the Board of Trustees voted to "authorize the faculty to make all the arrangements for the packing and removal of college property at Hanover to Durham." The Class of 1893, followed the previous class and held commencement exercises in unfinished [[Thompson Hall (University of New Hampshire)|Thompson Hall]], the [[Romanesque Revival]] campus centerpiece designed by the prominent [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] architectural firm of [[Edward Dow (architect)|Dow &amp; Randlett]].

In fall 1893, classes officially began in Durham with 51 [[First year|freshmen]] and 13 upperclassmen, which was three times the projected enrollment. Graduate study was also established in fall 1893 for the first time. The number of students and the lack of state funds for dormitories caused a housing crunch and forced students to find housing in town. The lack of housing caused difficulty for attracting women to the university. In 1908, construction on Smith Hall, the first women's dorm, was completed using private and state funds. Prior to the construction of Fairchild Hall in 1915 for male students, 50 freshmen lived in the basement of DeMerritt Hall. With the continuing housing shortage for men, the administration encouraged the growth of the UNH [[Greek system]]. From the late 1910s through the 1930s, the fraternity system expanded and provided room and board for male students.

In 1923, Gov. Fred Herbert Brown signed a bill changing the name of the college to '''University of New Hampshire'''.

In the spring of 2015, the university was given $4 million from the estate of [[Robert Morin (librarian)|Robert Morin]], who had been a librarian at the university for almost 50 years. Having lived a frugal and secluded life, he allowed for his life's savings to be given to the university without restraint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/news/release/2016/08/30/long-time-librarian-surprises-unh-4-million-gift|title=Long-Time Librarian Surprises UNH with $4 Million Gift|date=August 30, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the news that the university was spending $1 million on a new video screen for the football stadium provoked criticism, on and off-campus, with critics noting that the difference between that amount and the $100,000 the university transferred to the library was jarring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/15/494134464/-1-million-of-frugal-librarians-bequest-to-n-h-school-goes-to-football-scoreboar|title=$1 Million Of Frugal Librarian's Bequest To N.H.

The university is a member of the [[New England Board of Higher Education]]'s New England Regional Student Program (NERSP) where New England public universities and colleges offer a number of undergraduate curricula with special considerations to students from other New England states. If an out-of-state student's home state school does not offer a certain degree program offered by UNH, that student can receive the in-state tuition rate, plus 75 percent if enrolled in the program.

The Thompson School of [[Applied Science]] (TSAS), first established in 1895 and now a division of COLSA, confers an [[associate degree]] in applied science in seven different programs: Applied Animal Science, Applied Business Management, Civil Technology, Community Leadership, Food Service Management, Forest Technology, and Horticultural Technology.

The coastal proximity of the university affords excellent programs in [[marine biology]] and [[oceanography]]. Facilities include the Jackson Estuarine Laboratory at Adams Point in Durham, and the [[Shoals Marine Laboratory]] jointly operated with [[Cornell University]] on [[Appledore Island]] in the [[Isles of Shoals]].

The [[University of New Hampshire Observatory]] is operated by the Department of Physics for educational purposes.

There are three main university-wide undergraduate research programs: Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF), and International Research Opportunities Program (IROP).

The university offers many opportunities for students to study abroad through managed programs, exchange programs and approved programs. As of fall 2004, there were 561 students (4 percent of the student body) studying in 38 different countries. The university runs/manages 22 study abroad programs in locations which include [[Cambridge]], England; [[London]], England; [[Edinburgh]], Scotland; [[Brest, France]]; [[Dijon]], France; [[Grenoble]], France; [[Budapest]], Hungary; [[Osaka]], Japan; [[Utrecht]], Netherlands; [[Maastricht]], Netherlands; [[Ascoli Piceno]], Italy; New Zealand; India; South Africa; Kenya; and [[Granada]], Spain. The university also accepts credit from over 300 approved programs that are run through other institutions.  The university organizes an annual summer abroad program at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].  There are also over 100 National Exchange Program opportunities.

In 2010, the [[Franklin Pierce Law Center]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] was incorporated into the University of New Hampshire System and renamed the [[University of New Hampshire School of Law]]. It is the only law school in the state of New Hampshire. The School of Law offers Juris Doctor degrees in addition to graduate studies in Intellectual Property and Commerce &amp; Technology. The University of New Hampshire Law School is renowned for its intellectual property law programs, consistently ranking in the top ten of U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings.  In 2012, it was ranked 4th behind University of California at Berkeley, Stanford University and George Washington University.

The [[Whittemore School of Business and Economics|Peter T.

==Underrepresented students==
===Diversity Support Coalition===

The student led Diversity Support Coalition (DSC) mission aims to offer resources to groups “affected by institutionalized oppression based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity and expression, age, ability, native language, national origin, and/or religion at UNH”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diversity Support Coalition|url=https://wildcatlink.unh.edu/organization/DSC|website=WildcatLink|access-date=April 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427044531/https://wildcatlink.unh.edu/organization/DSC|archive-date=April 27, 2018|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSC promotes, educates, and supports multiculturalism, diversity, and equality at UNH through programming efforts and support of the six student organizations within the DSC. The six member groups are Alliance, The Black Student Union, Hillel, Mosaico, The Native American Cultural Association, and The United Asian Coalition. Participation in the DSC is open to all UNH students. The DSC encourages student organizations with similar needs be recognized under the Diversity Support Coalition and may due so by submitting a petition within the guidelines for the DSC constitution. The total membership of the DSC is 200 individuals.

In addition to the six organizations within the DSC, UNH students run over a dozen groups for the purpose of multiculturalism and peer reference groups. Groups include women in professional fields, country or geographic specific cultural clubs, and international student clubs.

=== Women ===

Multiple organizations on campus are focused on providing women in professional fields access to relational and ideational resources promoting success. Women focused groups on campus include Her Campus, UNH Data Driven Women, Women in Business, Society of Woman Engineers, and Women in Science.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unh.edu/career/career-resources-women&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural clubs ===

Culturally focused groups on campus include Desi Student Association, Japanese Cultural Club, Indonesian Student Association, International Student Organization Middle Eastern Cultural Association, Russian Cultural Club and Vietnamese Student Association. These groups often host events to educate the student body on their cultures and to welcome experts of ancestral crafts. Conversely, the Committee on Rights and Justice (CORAJ) partners UNH student's with local immigrant families, helping them with the naturalization process.

=== International students ===

The University instituted the [[Navitas Group|Navitas program]] in 2011 to expand the amount of international students at the school. This expanded over the years into the Global Student Success Program (GSSP). The GSSP, in cooperation with the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), gives students the support to “help discover opportunities at UNH to immerse in American culture and share your own traditions with others from the U.S. and from around the globe”.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unh.edu/global/international-students&lt;/ref&gt; The programs guide students through the application process and the extent of their career.

During Fall 2015, UNH enrolled 298 Students from 34 different countries. The most common countries of origin are the People's Republic of China, Canada, and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Undergraduate Profile|url=https://admissions.unh.edu/sites/default/files/media/pdf/unh_2016_profile_with_2015-2016_tuition_3.pdf|website=University of New Hampshire Office of Admissions|publisher=University of New Hampshire|accessdate=1 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810024821/http://admissions.unh.edu/sites/default/files/media/pdf/unh_2016_profile_with_2015-2016_tuition_3.pdf|archive-date=August 10, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school also offers intensive English language education for students through the ESL Institute. As well as advancing student’s knowledge of English as a second-language one of the goals of the ESL Institute is to “to provide students with the cultural knowledge and awareness needed to function satisfactorily, both academically and socially, in the United States”.&lt;ref&gt;https://cola.unh.edu/esl-institute/mission-statement&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2015 year the university had almost 300 students representing the school from over 30 countries.

===First-generation college students===
Begun in 1994, UNH Connect is a program where FGCS (and multicultural students) are given a jump-start to the experiences of college life with a summer pre-orientation program aimed at social connection and comfortability with college life. Each student is assigned a peer mentor who helps with the transition to their freshman year. The program, with 100 students in 2014, also gives FGCS an opportunity to meet people in similar situations prior to the beginning of college.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unh.edu/orientation/connect/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center For Academic Resources (CFAR) also offers a program called TRIO that is partially funded by the US Department of Education. TRIO is intended for students who are FGCS, have a disability, or are in extreme financial need. Through the TRIO program you can receive services to help understand options for future careers as well as advice with financial aspects of college most FGCS would not have home support with. These include academic tutoring, assistance with student loans, scholarship advise, individual counseling, career planning, and many more. In the 2017-18 school year the UNH TRIO program was funded for 200 students.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unh.edu/cfar/triostudent-support-services&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The University of New Hampshire offers two undergraduate degree programs: the Bachelor of Arts in music and the Bachelor of Music; and two graduate degree programs: the Master of Arts in music (concentrations in composition, conducting, and musicology), and the Master of Arts in teaching.

==Athletics==
{{main|New Hampshire Wildcats}}
[[File:Whittemore Center, UNH 2.jpg|thumb|Whittemore Center]]
The school's athletic teams are the [[University of New Hampshire Wildcats|Wildcats]], and they compete in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]]. New Hampshire is a member of the [[America East Conference]] for [[basketball]], [[Cross country running|cross country]], [[track and field]], [[soccer]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] &amp; [[Diving (sport)|diving]] and [[tennis]]; and women's [[lacrosse]], [[crew]], [[field hockey]], and [[volleyball]]. The women's gymnastics&lt;ref&gt;[http://unhwildcats.com/index.aspx?path=wgym women's gymnastics]&lt;/ref&gt; program competes in the Eastern Atlantic Gymnastics League at the Division I level. They also compete in [[Hockey East]] in men's and women's [[ice hockey]], Eastern Collegiate Ski Association for skiing, as well as the [[Colonial Athletic Association]] for [[American football|football]] at the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS, formerly known as [[Division I-AA]]) level.

In the 2006 academic year the university cut women's crew, men's swimming &amp; diving, and men's and women's tennis at the varsity level, and trimmed the size of the men's ski team from 27 to 12. Luckily the UNH men's ski team was not cut, as they remain one of the top powerhouse teams in the nation. In 2013, the men's alpine team placed second  at the NCAA championships. The reason given was that the athletic department would save $500,000 towards a $1 million budget shortfall and be in compliance with [[Title IX]] for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhwildcats.com/pres0506/013106.shtml] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219141044/http://www.unhwildcats.com/pres0506/013106.shtml|date=February 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the university cut baseball, softball, men's and women's golf, and men's lacrosse.

In addition to varsity athletics, the university offers many club sports through the Department of Campus Recreation, including [[aikido]], [[archery]], [[baseball]], [[crew]], [[cycling]], [[dance]], [[fencing (sport)|fencing]], [[figure skating]], [[golf]], men's [[lacrosse]], [[Nordic skiing]], [[rugby football|rugby]], [[sailing]], [[softball]], [[tennis]], [[taekwondo]], men and women's Ultimate Frisbee,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://thenewhampshire.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/ultimate-frisbee-sisters-of-oriza-a-look-inside-womens-ultimate| last1=Johnson| first1=Cameron| title=Ultimate Frisbee: Sisters of Oriza: A look inside women's Ultimate| work=[[The New Hampshire]]| date=November 7, 2014| accessdate=November 12, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012085115/https://thenewhampshire.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/ultimate-frisbee-sisters-of-oriza-a-look-inside-womens-ultimate/| archive-date=October 12, 2015| dead-url=yes| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]], and the Woodsmen Club. Many of these clubs compete either on an intercollegiate basis with New England teams, or sponsor university tournaments and frequently participate in national championships. UNH also offers horseback riding as a recreation. Many students can take horseback riding lessons with instructors, on their horse or the schools. UNH holds many events each year, for they have a large cross country course. UNH also has a [[dressage]] team and a hunt seat team that competes yearly.

The school's official colors are [[blue]] and [[white]]. The school's official mascot is the [[Bobcat|wildcat]] and its uniformed mascot is known as "[[Wild E. Cat]]".

The recognized [[fight song]] of UNH is "[[On to Victory (song)|On to Victory]]", the most current version of which was arranged by Tom Keck, Director of Athletic Bands from 1998–2003. In 2003, "UNH Cheer" (originally titled "Cheer Boys") was resurrected from the university archives by Erika Svanoe, Director of Athletic Bands from 2003-2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.erikasvanoe.com/conducting.html| title=Professional Experience| publisher=ErikaSvanoe.com| accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the school song "Old New Hampshire", not to be confused with the [[Old New Hampshire|New Hampshire state song]] of the same name, "UNH Cheer" currently serves as a secondary fight song and is often performed immediately following "On to Victory".

On October 7, 2006, Wildcats [[wide receiver]] [[David Ball (wide receiver)|David Ball]] tallied the 51st receiving [[touchdown]] of his career to displace [[Jerry Rice]] of [[Mississippi Valley State University]], who was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] a month earlier, atop the ranking of NCAA Division I and I-AA players by career receiving touchdowns. He later signed as a [[rookie]] [[free agent]] with the [[Chicago Bears]] and played with well-known college football players [[Chris Leak]] and [[Darius Walker]].

==Durham campus==
[[File:CongreveAcrossTHall.JPG|thumb|left|Congreve Hall]]The University of New Hampshire is located in the town of [[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham]], and is a "traditional New England campus." The Durham campus is {{convert|1100|acre|km2}}, with {{convert|300|acre|km2}} in the "campus core" and {{convert|800|acre|km2}} of open land on the west edge of campus. The campus core is considered to be the university property within a 10-minute walk from Thompson Hall, the symbolic and near-geographic center of campus. The campus core contains many of the academic and residential buildings, while the outer campus contains much of the agriculture land and buildings. The university owns a total of {{convert|2600|acre|km2}} of land.

===Housing===
[[File:Smith Hall, UNH.jpg|thumb|right|Smith Hall c. 1915]]
[[File:Mills Hall.jpg|thumb|right|alt=alt text|Mills Hall - suites]]
[[File:Durham NH 011.jpg|thumb|left|Babcock Hall]]
The university offers all underclassmen the opportunity to live in university housing. As of 2006, the university housed 55% of all undergraduate students. While not required to live on campus freshman year, students are strongly encouraged to; as of the fall 2009 semester over 99% of incoming freshmen chose to live on campus, and over 70% of returning sophomores did as well.

The university offers students a choice of traditional dorm rooms, suites, and on-campus apartments. The university's Campus Master Plan envisions housing about 60% of undergraduates, requiring an addition of 1700 beds. However, the state of New Hampshire does not provide funding for non-academically related buildings, including dormitories.

Undergraduate housing is divided into three areas: The Hills, The Valley and The Timbers (formerly Area I, Area II and Area III, respectively). There are also two undergraduate apartment complexes, The Gables and Woodside Apartments. The university offers family housing in the Forest Park apartments and graduate housing in Babcock Hall. The second oldest dorm on campus is Hetzel Hall, named after the university's former president [[Ralph D. Hetzel]]. Built in 1925, it is located near downtown Durham.

For the fall 2006 semester, two new buildings at The Gables ("North" and "South") were opened, providing an additional 400 beds. In summer 2006, one-half of Forest Park was demolished to make way for two new buildings (A &amp; B) of the Southeast Residential Community (SERC). Buildings SERC A and SERC B have provided housing for 492 students since fall 2007. Two existing mini-dorms were demolished during summer 2007 (leaving four more mini-dorms) to construct a third building, SERC C, which has provided housing for 235 students since fall 2008. SERC A, B, and C are now referred to as Handler, Peterson, and Haaland Hall. Plans exist to provide 781 new beds by demolishing the remaining 9 buildings (98 units) in Forest Park. Later plans call for the construction of a new 170-unit graduate housing facility at a location to be determined.

Due to the over-enrollment of the 2006–2007 academic year, the university offered students who intended to live in campus housing a free parking pass for the academic year, credit in UNH "Dining Dollars" and a refund of the housing deposit given that the student withdrew their intentions to live on campus. The incentive was designed to free up space for the large incoming freshman class.

Stoke Hall is the largest residence building on campus. It houses a little over 700 undergraduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.unh.edu/housing/facility/stoke-hall| title=Stoke Hall| publisher=University of New Hampshire Housing &amp; Residential Life| accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, UNH installed life-saving [[automated external defibrillator]]s in two fraternity houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = UNH installs AEDs in fraternity houses| url = http://www.wmur.com/news/unh-installs-aeds-in-fraternity-houses/36336182| publisher = [[WMUR]]| accessdate = November 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themed housing===
The University of New Hampshire offers themed housing options for students interested in choosing a living environment that best suits their personality. Common themes include: first year, leadership, green living, multi-cultural, honors, chem-free, alcohol and drug-free and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.residential-life.unh.edu/living/hallsandthemes.html |title=Living on Campus – Theme Living Communities |publisher=University of New Hampshire Housing &amp; Residential Life |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Housing is guaranteed to all new first-year students, with many of them housed in Christensen Hall and [[Williamson Hall]], the two largest first-year-only halls. Alexander Hall is also an all first-year student hall, specifically for students in the College of Liberal Arts who have not declared a major yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Alexander Hall| url=http://www.unh.edu/housing/facility/alexander-hall| publisher=University of New Hampshire Housing &amp; Residential Life| accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These halls offer a living environment of commonality, where all are new to the university. The university guarantees students who live on-campus the ability to live on campus all four years. However, students who move off campus (with the exception of students studying abroad) lose this guarantee, and must complete a housing wait-list application each semester in order to be considered for on-campus housing the following semester.&lt;ref name=wait-list&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unh.edu/housing/process/waitlist.html |title=UNH Housing Waitlist Process |publisher=Unh.edu |date=February 29, 2012 |accessdate=July 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701173600/http://unh.edu/housing/process/waitlist.html |archive-date=July 1, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transfer students can generally get on campus housing if transferring to UNH for the spring semester (but must submit a completed housing wait-list application prior to transferring);&lt;ref name=wait-list/&gt; however, transfer students&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://admissions.unh.edu/transfer|title=Transfer Students|date=2016-02-03|work=Undergraduate Admissions|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; transferring for the fall semester have a relatively low chance of getting on campus housing due to the high demand of returning students, and the incoming freshman class. Transfer students are also not guaranteed housing, unless transferring from a community college after graduating with their associates.&lt;ref name=wait-list/&gt;

==Manchester campus==
[[File:Manch-mills-westside.jpg|thumb|right|The north end of the Amoskeag Millyard, on the [[Merrimack River]]]]
[[File:Manch-DownTown.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown [[Manchester, NH|Manchester]], looking south along Elm Street]]
As of March 2015, [[University of New Hampshire at Manchester]] is located in the {{convert|110000|sqft|adj=on}} Pandora Mill at 88 Commercial Street, on the banks of the [[Merrimack River]] in Manchester's historic [[Amoskeag Manufacturing Company|Amoskeag Millyard]]. The move to 88 Commercial Street increased the physical plant of the college by almost 50%, as from 2001 to 2014 the school was located in the {{convert|75000|sqft|adj=on}} University Center building at 400 Commercial Street.

==National Historic Chemical Landmark==
Conant Hall was dedicated as a [[ACS National Historical Chemical Landmarks|National Historical Chemical Landmark]]—the first in New Hampshire. Conant Hall was the first chemistry building on the Durham campus, and it was the headquarters of the [[American Chemical Society]] from 1907–1911, when Charles Parsons was the society’s secretary. In addition, from 1906–1928, the hall housed the laboratories of Charles James, who was an innovative developer of separation and analytical methods for compounds of rare earth elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acs.org/portal/acs/corg/content?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=PP_ARTICLEMAIN&amp;node_id=925&amp;content_id=CTP_004295&amp;use_sec=true&amp;sec_url_var=region1&amp;__uuid=7645e5b7-59c9-4b73-afa0-fd8a2804bfeb  ACS National Historic Chemical Landmark], Separation of Rare Earth Elements (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; James Hall, the second chemistry building on campus, was named for Charles James.

'''Victor Alexander de Waal''' (born 2 February 1929)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040202/ai_n12765276|title=FindArticles.com - CBSi|website=Findarticles.com|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a British Anglican priest.  He was the [[Dean of Canterbury]] from 1976 to 1986.

==Early life==
Victor de Waal was born in Amsterdam, the son of Hendrik de Waal, a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] businessman, and Elisabeth, of the [[Ephrussi family]]. His mother was born to a well-known Jewish family at the [[Ephrussi Palace]] in Vienna; she converted to Christianity, which would not have protected her from the murderous [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="ES2010"&gt;{{cite news|title=The artist whose secret family history became the surprise book of the|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/books/the-artist-whose-secret-family-history-became-the-surprise-book-of-the-year-6549583.html|accessdate=24 October 2017|work=[[Evening Standard]]|date=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the outbreak of World War II, the family moved to Britain and stayed there after the war, though retaining for many years their Dutch citizenship.&lt;ref name="Himes2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Himes|first1=Mavis|title=The Power of Names: Uncovering the Mystery of What We Are Called|date=2016|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|isbn=9781442259799|page=96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S2o7DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96|accessdate=24 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family came to live in [[Tunbridge Wells]] when he was a boy and he was educated at [[Tonbridge School]] and [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]]. His 2nd cousin once removed was the Right Rev. [[Hugo de Waal]], [[Bishop of Thetford]].&lt;ref name="HdWobit2007"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Right Rev Hugo de Waal|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/the-right-rev-hugo-de-waal-431254.html|accessdate=24 October 2017|work=[[The Independent]]|date=8 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He served as [[chaplain]] of [[King's College, Cambridge]] from 1959 to 1963 and the [[University of Nottingham]] from 1963 to 1969,&lt;ref&gt;''What is the Church'', SCM Press, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|chancellor]] of [[Lincoln Cathedral]]. 

From 1976 to 1986, he served as the [[Dean of Canterbury]].&lt;ref name="LivingChurch1980"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allchin (The Rev.

He helped with the research into his family history by his son, Edmund de Waal, which culminated in the book ''[[The Hare with Amber Eyes]]''.&lt;ref name="Moore2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Charles|title=The Spectator’s Notes {{!}} The Spectator|journal=[[The Spectator]]|date=21 January 2012|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2012/01/the-spectators-notes-154/|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Waal is an Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Advanced Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences of the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref name="Richardson1983"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Alan|last2=Bowden|first2=John|title=The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology|date=1983|publisher=[[Westminster John Knox Press]]|isbn=9780664227487|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PN7UMUTBBPAC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;lpg=PR16|accessdate=24 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He married Esther Aline Lowndes-Moir, author (as Esther de Waal) of books on spirituality, especially Celtic. Among their sons are John de Waal, a barrister; [[Alex de Waal]] (born 1963), a writer on Africa; [[Edmund de Waal]] (born 1964), a ceramic artist; and [[Thomas de Waal]] (born 1966), a writer.  They later separated.&lt;ref name="Wullschlager2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wullschlager|first1=Jackie|title=Lunch with the FT: Edmund de Waal|url=https://www.ft.com/content/835ade90-b4f0-11e3-af92-00144feabdc0|accessdate=24 October 2017|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''VisualFEA''' is a finite element analysis program running on MS Windows and Mac OS X platforms. The program is being developed and distributed by Intuition Software, Inc. in South Korea, and is used chiefly for structural and geotechnical analysis.  The strongest point of the program is its intuitive and user-friendly usage based on graphical pre- and postprocessing capabilities.  VisualFEA has educational functions for teaching and learning structural mechanics and finite element analysis through graphical simulation. Thus, this program is widely used in college courses related to structural mechanics and finite element method.

==Overview==
VisualFEA is a full-fledged finite element analysis program with many easy-to-use but powerful features, which can be classified largely into four parts: finite element processing, pre-processing, post-processing and educational simulation.  All the functions are integrated into a single executable module, which is a characteristic of the program distinguished from other finite element analysis programs generally composed of multiple modules.  The whole procedure from pre-processing to analysis, and to post-processing can be completed on the spot without launching one program after another, or without pipelining data from one program to another.

==Processing==
VisualFEA can solve the following types of problems.
* Mechanical analysis
:Truss, frame, plane stress, plane strain, axisymmetric, plate bending, shell and 3D solid 
:Linear, material nonlinear or geometric nonlinear analysis
:Static or dynamic analysis
:Construction staged analysis
:Geotechnical analysis (consolidation, slope stability analysis)
* Heat conduction analysis
:Plane, axisymmetric and 3D volume
:Steady state or transient analysis
:Linear or nonlinear material model
:Fire damage analysis
* Seepage analysis
:Plane, axisymmetric and 3D volume
:Steady state or transient analysis
:Confined or unconfined boundary condition
* Coupled analysis
:Heat conduction coupled mechanical analysis
:Seepage coupled mechanical analysis

==Pre-processing==
A finite element model in VisualFEA consists of various objects: curve, primitive surface, node, element and mesh. VisualFEA has its own CAD-like capabilities of creating graphical objects without aid of external programs. VisualFEA can create structured or unstructured meshes in two- or three-dimensional space using the following mesh generation schemes.
* Mapping scheme (lofting, tri-mapping, transfinite mapping, isoparametric mapping)  
* Sweeping scheme (extrusion, translation, rotation, twisting)
* Auto mesh scheme (triangulation, tetrahedronization)
* Mesh treatment (mesh carving, mesh operation, intersection, distortion)
The program has the function to save the generated mesh data in text format for use by other application programs. Other pre-processing capabilities include the following items.
* Definition and assignment of boundary conditions, material properties and element joints, etc.
* Node number or element number optimization
* Handling of element orientation, local coordinate axes

==Post-processing==
VisualFEA has various functions of visualizing the numerical data generated by solving the analysis models.  The most frequently used graphical representation of the data are the contour and vector images.  There are many other forms of graphical representation available in VisualFEA.&lt;ref&gt;J.Y.Lee and S-Y.Ahn, Interactive visualization of elasto-plastic behavior through stress paths and yield surfaces in finite element analysis, Finite Elements in Analysis and Design, 47(2011), pp496-510&lt;/ref&gt;

* Iso-surface
* Sliced plane, parallel plane, cross plane
* Diagram (bending moment diagram, shear force diagram, etc.)
* Curve plotting
* Data probing
* Animation

==Educational Simulation==
VisualFEA can be used as a tool for computer-aided education of structural mechanics and finite element method.  The tools are operated with the user-created modeling data and their ensuing analysis results on the basis of finite element technology.  They are devised to promote the understanding, and to stimulate the interest in the subjects by substantiating the conceptual principles and visually exhibiting the complex computational processes with the aid of interactive computer graphics.  The topics covered by the educational functions are as follows.
* Mathematical relationships of internal forces in rigid frames.&lt;ref&gt;J.Y.Lee and S-Y.Ahn, Finite element implementation for computer-aided education of structural mechanics:Frame analysis, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 22(2014), pp387-409&lt;/ref&gt;
* Geometric properties of an arbitrarily defined member section
* Stresses on the member sections
* Moving load
* Mohr circle and its application to elasto-plastic yielding.&lt;ref&gt;J.Y.Lee, H.R.Ryu and Y.T.Park, Finite element implementation for computer-aided education of structural mechanics:Mohr's circle and its application, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 22(2014), pp494-508&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stress path and yield surface
* Buckling
* Stiffness assembly and solution process in the finite element analysis.&lt;ref&gt;J.Y.Lee, Interactive simulation of finite element equation processing for educational purposes, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 23 (2015) pp157-169, DOI 10.1002/cae.21586&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shape function and interpolation
* Eigen value analysis.&lt;ref&gt;J.Y.Lee, H.R.Ryu, Interactive simulation of eigenmodes for instruction of finite element behavior, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 23 (2015) pp872-886, DOI 10.1002/cae.21659&lt;/ref&gt;
* Concept of adaptive analysis

==VisualFEA/CBT==
VisualFEA/CBT is an educational version of the program&lt;ref&gt;R.D.Cook and Intuition Software, VisualFEA and General User Manual, John Wiley and Son's Inc, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; published by [http://as.wiley.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-WILEYASIA2_SEARCH_RESULT.html?query=visualfea John Wiley and Son's Inc.] as a companion program to a textbook&lt;ref&gt;R.D.Cook, D.S.Malkus, M.E.Plesha, R.J.Witt, Concepts and Applications of Finite Element Analysis, 4th ed., John Wiley and Son's Inc, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; on finite element method. The program has the limitation of 3000 nodes that can be handled.
