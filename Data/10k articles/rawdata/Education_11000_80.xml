[[Image:Unterricht.jpg|thumb|225px|Demonstrating activity-based learning in the classroom]]
'''Activity-based learning''' or ABL describes a range of pedagogical approaches to teaching. Its core premises include the requirement that learning should be based on doing some hands-on experiments and activities. The idea of activity-based learning is rooted in the common notion that children are active learners rather than passive recipients of information. If child is provided the opportunity to explore by their own and provided an optimum learning environment then the learning becomes joyful and long-lasting.

==History of activity-based learning==
[[Image:David Horsburgh.jpg|thumb|225px|left|David Horsburgh: Pioneer of Activity-based learning]]
Activity-based learning started sometime in 1944 around World War II when a British man [[David Horsburgh]] came to India and finally decided to settle down there. He was an innovative thinker and charismatic leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Where mind is without fear |url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2004/01/11/stories/2004011100190700.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu |date=11 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started teaching in [[Rishi Valley School]]. He joined the [[British Council]] and worked in [[Chennai]] and [[Bangalore]] for many years. After his voluntary retirement, he located a {{convert|7|acre|m2|adj=on}} site in Kolar District and opened his school, Neel Bagh. Neel Bagh was based on an innovative idea of Horsburgh and known for its creative methods in teaching well-planned learning materials. With his wife Doreen and his son Nicholas, Horsburgh developed a diverse curriculum, which included music, carpentry, sewing, masonry, gardening, as well as the usual school subjects, English, mathematics, Sanskrit, and Telugu. These pedagogic materials were systematically planned, with sketches and drawings and an occasional touch of humour. Later Horsburgh created a magnificent library in Neel Baugh that was accessible to teachers and students. This initiative of Horsburgh was later proved to be one of the pioneer and milestones in ABL. In modern time ABL is the method of education followed in the Corporation schools of Chennai, from 2003, as an effort to provide special schools for children who had been freed from [[bonded labour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Report on ABL |author=Dr. Anandalakshmi |publisher=SSA |url=http://www.ssa.tn.nic.in/Docu/ABL-Report-by-Dr.Anandhalakshmi.pdf |pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==States and Organizations initiative on activity-based learning==
The ABL in its contemporary form was first undertaken by the [[Chennai]] Corporation in 13 schools on a trial basis in 2003, has been adopted by all the 270 primary schools in the district. First designed and tested by the [[Rishi Valley School]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]] in the '90s, the Activity-Based Learning system has been successfully implemented in several Indian states and union territory, including [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Gujarat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ictpost.com/gujarat-trendsetter-in-activity-based-learning/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904174550/http://ictpost.com/gujarat-trendsetter-in-activity-based-learning/ |archivedate=2014-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Haryana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/haryana-launches-activity-based-learning-programme/1/341988.html |title=Haryana launches activity-based learning programme in government schools : News |publisher=Indiatoday.intoday.in |date=2014-02-06 |accessdate=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maharashtra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Share on Twitter |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/Activity-based-learning-to-be-introduced-in-200-more-schools/articleshow/38019841.cms |title=Activity based learning to be introduced in 200 more schools - Times of India |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2014-07-08 |accessdate=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chandigarh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/chandigarh/activity-based-learning-is-edu-dept-s-key-focus/article1-1247771.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904004257/http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/chandigarh/activity-based-learning-is-edu-dept-s-key-focus/article1-1247771.aspx |archivedate=2014-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tamil Nadu]], [[UNICEF]] supported the Chennai Corporation to introduce the ABL methods in the Government schools. There are many organizations which cultivate and follow the principles of activity-based learning. [http://www.digantar.org/ Digantar Siksha evam Khelkud Samiti] in [[Rajasthan]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110723012649/http://www.alternativeeducationindia.net/sumavanam.htm Sumavanam Village School] in [[Andhra Pradesh]], [http://www.waldenspath.com Walden's Path]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Learning in every corner|journal=Teacher Plus|date=4 January 2016|issue=January 2016|url=http://www.teacherplus.org/2016/january-2016/learning-in-every-corner|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Telangana]] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20110723012709/http://www.alternativeeducationindia.net/vikasana_school.htm Vikasana School] in [[Karnataka]] are the places which were established on the principles of activity-based learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alternative Education in India |url=http://www.alternativeeducationindia.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
[[Image:LearningTheCountriesOfAsia.jpg|thumb|225px|Let the child explore and learn]]
The philosophy of ABL finds its antecedents in the common notion that learning can be done best when it is initiated by the surrounding environment and motivated by providing optimum opportunities to learn. A fearless and freedom to express environment always adds to best learning outcomes.

==Impact on India==
Under Activity Based learning education main focus is on child or we can say that it is one of child centered approach. It develops self-learning skill among the learners and allows a child to study according to his or her skill . Activities here can be in the form of songs, Drawings,Rhymes,Role play to teach a letter or a word, solve mathematical problems, form a sentence, understand social science or even concept of science. The learner takes report Card only after completing all the steps in a subject. If a child is absent even a single day he starts from where he left unlike in the old system and the child had to do self learning of the missed portions.

The key feature of the Activity Based Learning (ABL) method is that it uses child-friendly educational aids to foster self-learning and allows a child to study according to his or her aptitude and skill. ABL serves as one model of child-centered, child-friendly education, which is the mandate of the [[Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act]] (RTE) Act in India.

The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Scheme by Government has introduced many initiative and creative methods to bring about changes in teaching method for both- Teacher as well as learners. In state of Tamil Nadu, the elementary schools have taken initiative to use methodology called Activity Based Learning through [[Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan]].

==Characteristics of activity-based learning==
The key feature of the ABL method is that it uses child-friendly educational aids to foster [[Autodidacticism|self-learning]] and allows a child to study according to his/her [[aptitude]] and [[skill]]. Under the system, the curriculum is divided into small units, each a group of Self Learning Materials (SLM) comprising attractively designed study cards for [[English language|English]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[maths]], [[science]] and Social Science. When a child finishes a group of cards, he completes one "milestone". Activities in each milestone include games, rhymes, drawing, and songs to teach a letter or a word, form a sentence, do maths and science, or understand a concept. The child takes up an Exam Card only after completing all the milestones in a subject. 
On a common chart, the milestones are arranged in the form of a ladder and the child knows exactly which milestone he completed in the last lesson. This is a child-friendly way to evaluate and reinforce learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Children enjoy learning in Activity Based Learning Schools|url=http://unicef.in/Story/469/Children-enjoy-learning-in-Activity-Based-Learning-Schools-|website=unicef.in }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a child is absent one day, he/she continues from where he/she left unlike in the old system where the children had to learn on their own what they missed out on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Activity based learning- A radical change in Primary Education |publisher=UNICEF |url= http://www.unicef.org/india/education_1546.htm |website=unicef.in }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Black Girls Code''' ('''BGC''') is a not-for-profit organization that focuses on providing technology education for [[African-American]] girls. [[Kimberly Bryant (technologist)|Kimberly Bryant]], an [[electrical engineer]] who had worked in [[biotech]] for over 20 years, founded Black Girls Code in 2011 to rectify the underrepresentation of female African-Americans in the technology industry.&lt;ref name="Robehmed"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2013/08/30/black-girls-code-tackles-tech-inclusion/|title=Black Girls Code Tackles Tech Inclusion|last=Robehmed|first=Natalie|date=August 30, 2013|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilpin" /&gt; The organization offers programs in computer programming, coding, as well as website, robot, and mobile application-building, with the goal of providing African-American youth with the skills to occupy some of the 1.4 million computing job openings expected to be available in the U.S. in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/btn_02272013web.pdf |title=By the Numbers |website=www.ncwit.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
Bryant was inspired to start BGC after her [[gamer]] daughter, Kai, attended a computing summer camp and was disappointed in the experience.&lt;ref name="Gilpin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/black-girls-code-founder-kimberly-bryant-engineer-entrepreneur-mother/#.|title=Black Girls Code founder Kimberly Bryant: Engineer.

She also noted that the boys at the camp were given much more attention from the counselors than the few girls there.&lt;ref name="Gilpin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SFNews" /&gt; In an interview with [[Ebony (magazine)|''Ebony'']], Bryant stated, "I wanted to find a way to engage and interest my daughter in becoming a [[digital creative]] instead of just a consumer, and I did not find other programs that were targeted to girls like her from underrepresented communities."&lt;ref name="Phanor-Faury"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebony.com/life/black-girls-code-founder-kim-bryant-talks-333#axzz2z0qE3OOB|title=Black Girls Code’s Kim Bryant Talks Bits and Bytes|last=Phanor-Faury|first=Alexandra|date=March 19, 2014|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
BGC has become a rapidly growing phenomenon, quickly expanding in the USA and abroad. Headquartered in [[Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco]], the organization grew to 2,000 students by August 2013 within the 7 established institutions &lt;ref name="Robehmed" /&gt; operating in 7 States across the US, as well as in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Ntim"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lottie-ntim/when-black-girls-code_b_4427516.html|title=When Black Girls Code|last=Ntim|first=Lottie|date=December 12, 2013|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; BGC seeks to double their reach by adding chapters in the US and Africa over the next two years.&lt;ref name="D'Ignazio"&gt;{{cite web | last=D'Ignazio |first=Catherine |title=Kimberly Bryant and Black Girls Code | date=November 18, 2013|work=MIT Center for Civic Media| accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; BGC also hosts bilingual workshops in partnership with Latino Startup Alliance.&lt;ref name="Gilpin" /&gt; BGC's ultimate goal is "to grow to train 1 million girls by 2050 and become the 'girl scouts' of technology." &lt;ref name="D'Ignazio" /&gt; 

BGC depends on a vast body of [[volunteering|volunteers]] to design and conduct workshop classes. Professionals from the IT sector share their expertise with the young students, helping them get acquainted with the fundamentals of software design in languages such as [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]] or [[Ruby on Rails]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackgirlscode.com/what-we-do.html|title=What We Do|website=Black Girls Code   imagine. build. create.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After school activities are alternated with day-long workshops; an extended course is held during the summer. 

BGC primarily relies on donations to fund its activities; 75% students are currently on scholarships.&lt;ref name="Robehmed" /&gt; 

The motto of the Black Girls Code is: "Imagine. Build. Create. – Imagine a world where everyone is given the tools to succeed, and then help us build ways for everyone to access information and create a new age of women of color in technology".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

==Awards and grants==
Black Girls Code received a $50,000 grant from [[Microsoft Azure|Microsoft's Azure development]] (AzureDev) community campaign in January 2014.&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geekwire.com/2014/black-girls-code-code-org-among-named-azuredev-grant-winners/|title=Black Girls Code, Code.org win Microsoft AzureDev grants|last=Frank|first=Blair Hanley|date=January 15, 2014|work=[[Geekwire]]|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Black Girls Code founder Kimberly Bryant also received a "Standing O-vation" presented by [[Oprah Winfrey]] and Toyota in November 2014.&lt;ref name="SFNews"&gt;{{cite news| last=Shumaker | first=Laura|title=Oprah gives San Francisco’s Kimberly Bryant a Standing O-vation| journal=SFGate| year=2014|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/lshumaker/2014/11/17/oprah-gives-san-franciscos-kimberly-bryant-a-standing-o-vation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cogmed''' was a company that developed a [[cognitive training]] software program. The company was founded based on software created in the lab of [[Torkel Klingberg]], a neuroscientist at the Karolinska Institute, who was using it to present [[working memory]] challenges to people while he studied their brains using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]], to try to learn about  [[neuroplasticity]].&lt;ref name=Globe2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=sciencebusiness&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kenward|first1=Michael|title=Torkel Klingberg: More than just a computer game|url=https://sciencebusiness.net/news/71324/Torkel-Klingberg%3A-More-than-just-a-computer-game|work=ScienceBusiness|date=5 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the studies appeared to show that the challenges improved working memory, Klingberg founded Cogmed in 2001, with financial backing from the Karolinska Institute and venture capitalists.&lt;ref name=sciencebusiness/&gt;&lt;ref name="scie_Trai"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Training the Brain| last = Sinha | first = Gunjan| work = Scientific American| date = 2005-07-11| url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/training-the-brain/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cogmed's initial marketing was focused on helping people with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] and expanded to other impairments of working memory, such as persons with learning disabilities, and people who had a stroke or other traumatic brain injury.&lt;ref name=Globe2014&gt;{{Cite news| title = Do brain games work?| author = Michael Fitzgerald| work = The Boston Globe| date = 2014-10-09| url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2014/10/09/brain-games-work/rXjTWOKUYK5UOiNQ6St0fN/story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scie_Trai"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CogmedClaims&gt;{{cite web|title=Cogmed Claims and Evidence|url=http://www2.cogmed.com/l/6032/2012-03-27/7st5w/6032/48666/Cogmed__Research_Claims_and_Evidence.pdf|website=cogmed.com|publisher=Pearson Education|accessdate=26 May 2015|date=2014-06-18}}{{rp|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Cogmed was purchased by [[Pearson Education]] and became a part of the Pearson Clinical Assessment Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: PsychCorp Announces Acquisition of Cogmed|url=https://www.pearsonassessments.com/news/2010/psychcorp-announces-acquisition-of-cogmed.html|work=Pearson|date=July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook2013"/&gt;  Karolinksa received 22m SEK and double digit royalties as part of the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Report 2010|url=http://www.karolinskadevelopment.com/files/8313/0400/4257/KD_%C3%A5rsred_ENG.pdf|publisher=Karolinska Development|page=59|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 meta-analysis of 23 research studies on seven different commercial and non-commercial working memory training techniques (including Cogmed) found that "working memory training programs give only near-transfer effects, and there is no convincing evidence that even such near-transfer effects are durable."&lt;ref name="Lervag"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Melby-Lervag M, Hulme C | title=Is Working Memory Training Effective?

[[File:Giovanni Paolo Pannini 002.jpg|thumb|300px|''Roman ruins with a prophet'', by [[Giovanni Pannini]], 1751. The artistic cultural heritage of the [[Roman Empire]] served as a foundation for later [[Western culture]], particularly via the [[Renaissance]] and [[Neoclassicism]] (as exemplified here).]]
'''Cultural heritage''' is the legacy of physical artifacts and intangible attributes of a group or [[society]] that is inherited from past generations. 

Cultural heritage includes [[cultural property|tangible culture]] (such as buildings, monuments, landscapes, books, works of art, and artifacts), intangible culture (such as folklore, traditions, language, and knowledge), and natural heritage (including culturally significant landscapes, and [[biodiversity]]).&lt;ref&gt; Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl &lt;/ref&gt;

The deliberate act of keeping cultural heritage from the present for the future is known as [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|preservation]] (American English) or [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] (British English), though these terms may have more specific or technical meaning in the same contexts in the other dialect.

== The ethics and rationale of cultural preservation ==
Objects are a part of the study of human history because they provide a concrete basis for ideas, and can validate them. Their preservation demonstrates a recognition of the necessity of the past and of the things that tell its story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Tanselle| first =G. Thomas | publication-date = 1998 | title = Literature and Artifacts | publication-place =Charlottesville, VA | publisher =Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia | isbn = 1-883631-06-8 | oclc = 39223648 | year =1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Past is a Foreign Country'', [[David Lowenthal]] observes that preserved objects also validate [[memory|memories]]. While [[3D scanner|digital acquisition techniques]] can provide a technological solution that is able to acquire the shape and the appearance of artifacts with an unprecedented precision&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=Paolo Cignoni |author2=Roberto Scopigno |title=Sampled 3D models for CH applications: A viable and enabling new medium or just a technological exercise?|journal=ACM Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage |volume=1 | issue=1 |pages=1 |date=June 2008 |doi=10.1145/1367080.1367082| url=http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publications/2008/CS08/ | format=PDF |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in human history, the actuality of the object, as opposed to a reproduction, draws people in and gives them a literal way of touching the past. This unfortunately poses a danger as places and things are damaged by the hands of tourists, the light required to display them, and other risks of making an object known and available. The reality of this risk reinforces the fact that all artifacts are in a constant state of chemical transformation, so that what is considered to be preserved is actually changing – it is never as it once was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Lowenthal| first =David | publication-date = 1985 | title = The Past is a Foreign Country | publication-place =New York | publisher =Cambridge University Press | isbn = 0-521-22415-2 | oclc = 12052097 | year =1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly changing is the value each generation may place on the past and on the artifacts that link it to the past.

Classical civilizations, and especially the Indian, have attributed supreme importance to the preservation of tradition. Its central idea was that social institutions, scientific knowledge and technological applications need to use a "heritage" as a "resource".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url =https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvdavns.org%2Fdata%2Fproposing_varanasi.pdf   | title =  Proposing Varanasi for the World Heritage List of UNESCO| publisher =  Varanasi Development Authority}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Using contemporary language, we could say that ancient Indians considered, as social resources, both economic assets (like natural resources and their exploitation structure) and factors promoting social integration (like institutions for the preservation of knowledge and for the maintenance of civil order).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Singh, Rana P.B., Vrinda Dar and S. Pravin  | title =Rationales for including Varanasi as heritage city in the UNESCO World Heritage List  | publisher = National Geographic Journal of India (varanasi) 2001, 47:177-200  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethics considered that what had been inherited should not be consumed, but should be handed over, possibly enriched, to successive generations. This was a moral imperative for all, except in the final life stage of [[sannyasa]].

What one generation considers "cultural heritage" may be rejected by the next generation, only to be revived by a subsequent generation.

==Types of heritage==

===Cultural property===
{{see also|Material culture}}
[[Cultural property]] includes the physical, or "tangible" cultural heritage, such as artworks. These are generally split into two groups of movable and immovable heritage. Immovable heritage includes building so (which themselves may include installed art such as organs, stained glass windows, and frescos), large industrial installations or other historic places and [[monument]]s. Moveable heritage includes books, documents, moveable artworks, machines, clothing, and other artifacts, that are considered worthy of preservation for the future. These include objects significant to the archaeology, architecture, science or technology of a specified culture.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspects and disciplines of the preservation and conservation of tangible culture include:
* [[Museology]]
* [[Archival science]]
* [[Conservation (cultural heritage)]]
** [[Art conservation]]
** [[Archaeological conservation]]
** [[Architectural conservation]]
** [[Film preservation]]
** [[Phonograph record#Preservation|Phonograph record preservation]]
* [[Digital preservation]]

===Intangible culture===
[[File:Anker Grossvater erzählt eine Geschichte 1884.jpg|thumb|''The Grandfather tells a story'', by [[Albert Anker]], ca. 1884.]]
{{main article|Intangible cultural heritage}}

"Intangible cultural heritage" consists of non-physical aspects of a particular culture, more often maintained by social customs during a specific period in history. The concept includes the ways and means of behavior in a society, and the often formal rules for operating in a particular cultural climate. These include social values and [[tradition]]s, [[convention (norm)|customs]] and practices, [[aesthetic]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] beliefs, [[artistic expression]], [[language]] and other aspects of human activity. The significance of physical artifacts can be interpreted as an act against the backdrop of socioeconomic, political, ethnic, religious and philosophical values of a particular group of people. Naturally, intangible cultural heritage is more difficult to preserve than physical objects.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Aspects of the preservation and conservation of cultural intangibles include:

* [[folklore]]
* [[oral history]]
* [[language preservation]]

===Natural heritage===
{{See also|Conservation movement}}
"[[Natural heritage]]" is also an important part of a society's heritage, encompassing the [[countryside]] and natural environment, including [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]], scientifically known as [[biodiversity]], as well as geological elements (including mineralogical, geomorphological, paleontological, etc.), scientifically known as [[geodiversity]]. These kind of heritage sites often serve as an important component in a country's [[tourist industry]], attracting many visitors from abroad as well as locally. Heritage can also include cultural landscapes (natural features that may have cultural attributes).

Aspects of the preservation and conservation of natural heritage include:
* [[Rare breed (agriculture)|Rare breeds conservation]]
* [[Heirloom plant]]s

==World heritage movement==
[[File:Plaque Carthage Unesco.JPG|thumb|175px|Plaque stating the designation of [[Carthage]] as a World Heritage Site.]]
Significant was the Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage that was adopted by the General Conference of [[UNESCO]] in 1972. As of 2011, there are 936 [[World Heritage Sites]]: 725 cultural, 183 natural, and 28 mixed properties, in 153 countries. Each of these sites is considered important to the international community.

The underwater cultural heritage is protected by the [[UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage]]. This convention is a legal instrument helping states parties to improve the protection of their underwater cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[This convention is a legal instrument helping states parties to improve the protection of their underwater cultural heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, UNESCO has begun designating [[masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]. The [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] sitting as part of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] with article 15 of its Covenant had sought to instill the principles under which cultural heritage is protected as part of a basic human right.

Key international documents and bodies include:
* [[Athens Charter (Preservation)|Athens Charter]], 1931
* [[Roerich Pact]], 1935
* [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]], 1954, (with a definition of cultural heritage item adopted by some national law)
* [[Venice Charter]], 1964
* [[Barcelona Charter]], 2002 (regarding maritime vessel preservation)
* [[ICOMOS]]
* [[International Committee of the Blue Shield]] Managing natural and manmade disasters.
* [[International Institute for Conservation]]

==National and regional heritage movements==

The system of [[academic degree]]s at the [[University of Oxford]] can be confusing to those not familiar with it. This is not merely because many degree titles date from the Middle Ages, but also because many changes have been haphazardly introduced in recent years. For example, the (medieval) BD, BM, BCL, etc. are postgraduate degrees, while the (modern) MPhys, MEng, etc. are undergraduate degrees.

In [[postnominals]], "University of Oxford" is normally abbreviated "''Oxon.''", which is short for ''(Academia) Oxoniensis'': e.g., MA (Oxon.), although within the university itself the abbreviation "Oxf" can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/calendar/style.pdf |format=PDF |title=''Oxford University Calendar'': Notes on Style (12 March 2010) |website=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2016-07-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705094758/http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/calendar/style.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Undergraduate degrees==
* Bachelor of Arts ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]])
* Bachelor of Fine Art ([[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]])

The bachelor's degree is awarded soon after the end of the degree course (three or four years after [[matriculation]]). Until recently, all undergraduates studied for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The BFA was introduced in 1978. Holders of the degrees of BA and BFA both proceed in time to the degree of Master of Arts (MA). Note that the BA is still awarded even for some science courses, such as the three-year Physics degree which also still adheres to the traditional degree classification structure, with only 30% of candidates being awarded an upper second class honours or above. The degree of Bachelor of Science (BSc) has never been awarded as an undergraduate degree at Oxford; it used to be awarded as a graduate qualification, however.

* Bachelor of Theology ([[Bachelor of Theology|BTh]]) 
* Bachelor of Education ([[Bachelor of Education|BEd]])

The BTh is awarded primarily to students of the various theological colleges and halls, such as [[Wycliffe Hall]], [[St Stephen's House, Oxford|St Stephen's House]], [[Ripon College Cuddesdon]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040723004548/http://www.oxford.anglican.org/rcc/ Ripon College Cuddesdon, Oxford]. oxford.anglican.org&lt;/ref&gt; and the former [[Westminster College, Oxford]]. Usually, these students are candidates for the ordained ministry of one of the mainstream Christian denominations, but may be drawn from any faith background or none at the discretion of the College or Hall. It should not be confused with the degree of bachelor of divinity (BD), which is a postgraduate degree.

The BEd was formerly awarded to students residing at Westminster College, Culham College of Education, the Lady Spencer Churchill College of Education, and Milton Keynes College of Education (formerly the North Buckinghamshire College of Education) who read concurrently at the university.

===Undergraduate Master's degrees===
In the 1990s the following degrees were introduced to increase public recognition of the four-year undergraduate science programmes in these subjects:

* [[Master of Biochemistry]] (MBiochem)
* [[Master of Chemistry]] (MChem)
* [[Master of Computer Science]] (MCompSci)
* Master of Computer Science and Philosophy (MCompSciPhil), first entry 2012
* Master of Earth Sciences (MEarthSc)
* [[Master of Engineering]] (MEng)
* [[Master of Mathematics]] (MMath)
* Master of Mathematics and Computer Science (MMathCompSci)
* Master of Mathematics and Philosophy (MMathPhil)
* [[Master of Physics]] (MPhys)
* Master of Physics and Philosophy (MPhysPhil)

The holders of these degrees have the academic precedence and standing of BAs until the twenty-first term from matriculation, when they rank as MAs. From 2014 graduates with these degrees wear the same academic gown as a Master of Studies, with a black silk hood lined with sand fabric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/2013-2014/31october2013-no5039/notices/#135679 |title=Notices, Oxford University Gazette |website=Ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously the academic dress was simply the BA gown and hood, (from 2009, even after achieving MA status). In contrast, science undergraduates at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] may be granted the additional degree of [[Master of Natural Sciences]] (MSci) while continuing to be awarded the BA (and the subsequent MA). Note that [[biology]] and [[physiology]] undergraduates are still awarded the BA/MA, as these are currently three-year courses. All other undergraduates, whether their degree courses last three years or four years, are awarded the BA/MA

==Degree of Master of Arts==
{{main article|Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)}}

The degree of [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] is awarded to BAs and BFAs seven years after matriculation, without further examination, upon the payment of a nominal fee. Recipients of undergraduate master's degrees are not eligible to incept as MA, but are afforded the same privileges after the statutory twenty-one terms. This system dates from the [[Middle Ages]], when the study of the [[liberal arts]] took seven years.

==Postgraduate degrees==

===Bachelors' degrees===

* [[Bachelor of Divinity]] (BD)
* [[Bachelor of Medicine]] &amp; [[Bachelor of Surgery]] (BM, BCh)
* [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] (BCL)
* [[Bachelor of Literature|Bachelor of Letters]] (BLitt) (no longer awarded)
* [[Bachelor of Science]] (BSc) (no longer awarded)
* [[Bachelor of Music]] (BMus)
* [[Bachelor of Philosophy]] (BPhil) (now only awarded in Philosophy)

In medieval times a student could not study some subjects until he had completed his study in the liberal arts. These were known as the higher faculties. The degrees in Science and Letters were added in the 19th century, and the degree in Philosophy was added in 1914. The higher bachelor's degree programme is generally a taught programme of one or two years for graduates. In Medicine and Surgery this corresponds to the clinical phase of training, after which they are accorded the courtesy title "Doctor". The BD and BMus are open only to Oxford graduates who have done well in the BA examinations in divinity and music, respectively. The BPhil/MPhil is a part-taught, part-research degree which is often a stepping stone to the DPhil.

===Masters' degrees===

* [[Master of Surgery]] (MCh)

The MCh is the higher degree in surgery, and is awarded on similar conditions to higher doctorates such as the DM, e.g., ten years must have passed since the lower degree in the faculty. In medieval times the distinction between a master and doctor was not significant, and both words signified the higher degree in a faculty. The title "master" is used instead of "doctor", as surgeons in England are traditionally known as "Mr" rather than "Dr".

* [[Master of Philosophy]] (MPhil)
* [[Master of Letters]] (MLitt)
* [[Master of Science]] (MSc) (awarded by examination or by research)

Due to pressure from employers and overseas applicants to conform with [[United States]] practice, which is also that of most other UK universities, the BLitt, BSc, and BPhil (in degrees other than philosophy) were re-titled master's degrees.

* [[Magister Juris]] (MJur) 
* [[Master of Studies]] (MSt)
* [[Master of Theology]] (MTh)
* [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA)
* [[Master of Education]] (MEd)
* [[Master of Fine Arts]] (MFA)
* [[Master of Public Policy]] (MPP)

The MJur and MBA are awarded after taught courses, the MJur being the equivalent of the BCL for students from non-common-law backgrounds. The MSt is a one-year hybrid research/taught course which is the equivalent of the taught master's degree in most other UK universities. The MTh is an applied theology course for those intending to enter holy orders. The degree of [[Master of Education]] was formerly awarded to students at [[Westminster College, Oxford|Westminster College]], when that course was validated by the University.

===Diplomas===

* [[Diploma in (the name of the area of specialization)]] (Dip. in (...))

Historically at the oldest universities in the world (University of Oxford and University of Cambridge), a Diploma was a postgraduate qualification but it has mostly been replaced by the more common master's degree. However, in some cases the naming remains unchanged for historically significant areas or very specialized curriculum (for instance, the Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science retains its archaic name due to its historical significance in the history of computer science). It depends on the programme. However, in many cases at Oxbridge, Diploma is a Master-level qualification and require a thesis (the naming Diploma is used in case of a very specialised area that through learning process is going to be deeply explored). 
E.g. Oxford: Diploma in Geography, J. N. L. Baker (1921), Diploma in Legal Studies, Barney Williams (2004).

===Doctorates===

* [[Doctor of Divinity]] (DD)
* [[Doctor of Civil Law]] (DCL)
* [[Doctor of Medicine]] (DM)
* [[Doctor of Letters]] (DLitt)
* [[Doctor of Science]] (DSc)
* [[Doctor of Music]] (DMus)

Bachelors in the higher faculties other than Medicine can proceed to a doctorate in the same faculty without further examination, on presentation of evidence of an important contribution to their subject, e.g., published work, research, etc. Doctorates in the higher faculties may also be awarded ''honoris causa'', i.e., as honorary degrees. It is traditional for the Chancellor to be made a DCL ''jure officio'' (by virtue of his office). Until the 19th century all bishops who had studied at Oxford were made DDs ''jure officio''.

* [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (DPhil)

The DPhil is a research degree, modelled on the German and American PhD, that was introduced in 1914. Rather atypically, Oxford was the first university in the UK to accept this innovation.

* [[Doctor of Clinical Psychology]] (DClinPsychol)
* [[Doctor of Engineering]] (EngD)

:The new degrees of DClinPsychol and EngD are professional degrees in the American model. The EngD is the only Oxford degree to use the Cambridge abbreviation format.

Within each degree the holders are ranked by the date on which they proceeded to their degree. In the case of people who graduated on the same day they are ranked by alphabetical order.

If the Degree of Master of Biochemistry, or Chemistry, or Computer Science, or Earth Sciences, or Engineering, or Mathematics, or Mathematics and Computer Science, or Mathematics and Philosophy, or Physics, or Physics and Philosophy, is held together with a higher degree, the holder will rank in precedence equally with a person who holds the same higher degree together with the Degree of Master of Arts.

'''Education in the [[Falkland Islands]]''' is free and compulsory up to the end of the academic year when a child reaches 16 years of age. The Falklands follows the [[Education in England|English education system]].

==Primary and Secondary Education==
There are two schools in [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], the capital and only substantial settlement. The Infant and Junior School teaches ages 4 to 11 and the Falkland Islands Community School caters for ages 11 to 16. Other rural pupils are taught by travelling teachers. Older children can board in a hostel in Stanley so they can attend school there.&lt;ref name=gov&gt;{{cite web |title=Education |url=http://www.falklands.gov.fk/Education.html |publisher=Falkland Islands Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All teachers are trained in the UK or other English-speaking countries. There is also a primary school at [[RAF Mount Pleasant]] that mainly serves the children of members of the British armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/33B38396-ECB7-424A-8813-43A507260710/0/falklands_feb08.pdf |title=Information Sheet 1c Location Overview |publisher=Ministry of Defence of the United Kingdom |date=February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some primary aged children who live in "camp" (the local term for the countryside) are educated remotely.

==Post-16 Education==

There are no post-secondary institutions on the Falklands, post-secondary studies would require travel to the UK or beyond. The [[Falkland Islands Government]] pays for qualified 16- to 18-year-olds to go to England to take [[A-level]] courses at [[Peter Symonds College]], [[Winchester]] or to attend [[Chichester College]] to acquire National Diplomas or [[NVQ]]s.&lt;ref name="gov" /&gt; The government also funds higher and further education courses for over-18s, also usually in the UK, for suitably qualified students. 

Almost all return to the Falkland Islands after they have completed their education and gained experience in their chosen field&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.falklands.gov.fk/self-governance/relationship-with-argentina/|title=Relationship with Argentina {{!}} Falkland Islands Government|website=www.falklands.gov.fk|language=en|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4250">'''Equity Schools''' is a Chicago-based firm focused on solving capital and operational funding problems for schools, businesses, and other organizations. They primarily work with public, private, charter, and independent schools, and are known for using various non-conventional funding methods, or “nonlinear project funding.”

The firm was founded in 2001 by its current president [[Richard R. Murray]], who is most known for his invention of the corporate work study program used by the [[Cristo Rey Network]].

== History  ==
Murray's creation and first use of the nonlinear model was in 1996 when he was approached by [[Cristo Rey Jesuit High School (Chicago)|Cristo Rey High School in Chicago]] to help them find a way to fund their new school. The group had few assets and no plan of how they would create a quality program that would be affordable to inner city students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=More than a dream: the Cristo Rey story: how one school's vision is changing the world.|last=Kearney|first=G.R.|publisher=Loyola Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8294-2576-5|location=Chicago, Illinois|pages=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program Murray designed is based upon the concepts of [[job sharing]] and [[Professional employer organization|employee leasing]]; Cristo Rey students attend class four days per week, and then attend a corporate internship at a Chicago business on the fifth day. The revenues generated by these internships cover a great majority of tuition costs for Cristo Rey students, which helps keep their tuition rates low.

After implementation of this plan the Chicago community school saw its dropout rate decline from 75% to 1%, with 100% of graduates being accepted to college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/in-a-class-by-itself/|title=In A Class By Itself|access-date=2017-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cristo Rey Network now successfully operates this program at 32 schools across 21 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cristoreynetwork.org/about|title=About - Cristo Rey Network|website=www.cristoreynetwork.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray's experience creating the nonlinear method when working with Cristo Rey led him to found Equity Schools in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of educational reform and dissent.|last=Hunt|first=T. C.|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2010|isbn=1412956641|location=|pages=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its creation Equity Schools has worked with seven schools in the US to plan and implement solutions to funding problems. Projects that have implemented nonlinear models created by Equity Schools have seen a 100% success rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://equityschools.org/portfolio/|title=Portfolio - Equity Schools - Nonlinear Project Funding|work=Equity Schools - Nonlinear Project Funding|access-date=2017-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nonlinear Project Funding ==
The nonlinear approach used by Equity Schools is a method at working through funding problems when conventional sources of funding are not enough to accomplish a project or maintain operations. Conventional, or “linear,” sources of funding often rely upon fundraising and government programs (loans, grants, tax referendums). By contrast, a nonlinear approach may use conventional funding sources where applicable, but then examines relationships and existing revenue streams to identify sufficient funding from several, often non-obvious sources.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, R. R. (2017, April 8). [Telephone interview].&lt;/ref&gt;

Utilizing multiple diverse sources for funding makes a nonlinear approach highly conducive to a customized, self-sustaining funding strategy to support projects and operations. This approach is comprehensive as it includes factors such as a school's curriculum, character and culture, finances, real estate, and long-term educational, operational, and capital needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.a4le.org/websites/regions_and_chapters/index.php?p=592|title=Association for Learning Environments|website=www.a4le.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=August 2013}}
A '''foundation course''' is a preparatory course for university-level art and design education, used particularly in the [[United Kingdom]].

==Description==
The foundation course is a one or two year preparatory course for school-leavers who want to qualify for a place on a [[bachelor's degree]] course in art, design or architecture. The course is almost entirely practical in nature, although increasingly elements of art and design history have been introduced, and it is considered sufficient to qualify those who pass it to move on to a degree course without further study. It is the dominant form of entry to university and art college degree courses in the United Kingdom, but versions of it exist in several other countries, particularly where British influence over art education has been historically strong. In [[Ireland]] it is known as the Core Studies course, and versions of the foundation course also exist in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Cyprus]], [[Malta]], [[Malaysia]] and [[New Zealand]].

==Origin and methodology==
[[Harry Thubron]] at [[Leeds College of Art]]. Together they began to establish a team to deliver a new form of art preparation course they called the Basic Design Course. The aim of the course was to teach what were considered to be the basic skills that underpin all art and design activities, including architecture. This resulted in projects designed to develop skills in using colour, articulating two- and three-dimensional space, defining form and experimenting with diverse materials. Many of these theories were tested by Thubron at a series of art summer schools in the seaside town of [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire]], which attracted art students, artists and art teachers from throughout Britain. The result of this was that the theories of the basic design course were very widely disseminated, which helped the programme to become so widespread.

This approach to preparing art and design students for degree level study had its origins in the writings of [[Herbert Read]], and Coldstream, Thubron and Read regularly met to discuss their ideas at Read's house in the village of [[Stonegrave]], North Yorkshire. Read's ideas had their origin the German [[Bauhaus]] school of art, which had used a similar method prior to its closure by the [[Nazis]] in 1933.

A notable feature of this method of the foundation course method is that it does not teach basic versions of later art or design practices, so that someone wanting to be a painter would not be taught basic painting, or a student wanting to be a graphic designer would not be taught basic graphic design. Specific skills were left to be taught in the specific degree course itself, whereas the foundation course only focused on the core skills that are perceived to be common to all art and design practices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7689">'''François Thibaut''' (born January 3, 1948) is an educator known for developing the ''Thibaut Technique'' [[second language acquisition]] method for children and is the Founder/Director of ''The Language Workshop for Children'' (“LWFC”)He currently operates nationwide educational centers based in New York City.&lt;ref name="talklikeny"&gt;{{cite web| title = To Talk Like New York, Sign Up for Spanish| author = Qjito, Mirta | publisher = [[The New York Times]]| date = 1999-10-18|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E1DA1739F93BA25753C1A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=francois%20thibaut&amp;st=cse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thibaut’s technique is the basis of the curriculum offered at LWFC programs and in the [[Professor Toto]] children’s language education animation. The LWFC begins teaching languages to children at the age of six months, when they’re preverbal.&lt;ref name="blngualbaby"/&gt;[[Image:Thibaut.jpg|frame|right|Francois Thibaut at the Language Workshop For Children]]

==Childhood Observations, The Basis of the Thibaut Technique==
At the age of six Thibaut was enrolled at the [[Collège Sainte-Barbe|College Saint Barbe boarding school in Paris]] where teachers intentionally made little to no effort to translate or explain the meaning of the French language curriculum in which newly arriving, non-French speaking students found themselves immersed. Instead, after six weeks of absorbing French in a context-rich language immersion classroom, the non-French elementary age children would begin speaking French in single words. Then by week eight they were speaking in two, and then three word sentences.  Eventually, by 2½ months they were constructing complete, accent-free French sentences, correctly attributing noun genders, and using past, present, and future tenses.  Years later Thibaut realized that he’d observed a strong example of what neurolinguist [[Eric Lenneberg]] later identified in his book Biological Foundations of Language (1967) what he termed the [[critical period]] in language development. Thibaut’s childhood observations eventually led him to bring immersive, emotionally stimulating, context-rich, language classes founding his Cercle Franco Americain (later Language Workshop for Children) classes in New York, NY in the early 1970s. Thus, the Thibaut Technique was introduced into American culture.&lt;ref name="blngualbaby"&gt;{{cite web| title = Bilingual Babies, A Sign of the Times| author = Sreenivasan, Hari | publisher = [[Nightline (US news program)|ABC Nightline]]| date = 2007-01-30|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E1DA1739F93BA25753C1A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=francois%20thibaut&amp;st=cse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="superbaby"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Super Baby Burnout Syndrome| author = Elder, Janet | publisher = [[The New York Times]]| date = 1980-01-08|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4D71539F93BA35752C0A96F948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach has often been attributed to baby language enrichment products first introduced for VCR’s in the mid-1990s. While many of these brands have had more national exposure, Thibaut’s technique was in existence for more than 20 years prior to their debut.

==Early Teaching Experience==
Thibaut emigrated to [[New York City]]  in 1973, when foreign language instruction was strongly focused on high school and college students. As a teacher he was frustrated by watching his college-age students continually struggle the same drill and translation-based French so he began focusing on younger learners, abandoned translation-drills, and adopted the context-rich, language acquisition devices that he observed at his own elementary school in the 1950s, adding his own brand of playfulness, color, and humor.

==The Language Workshop for Children==
Since 1973, his internationally recognized Language Workshop for Children has offered stimulating language lessons for babies, toddlers and elementary grades. Original music, vocabulary-building songs, language immersion, festive visual aids, action games and native-fluent language teachers are why the LWFC is the country’s leader in children’s language educational play. As Thibaut says, “Children remember the words that make them happy”.

==The French Language Salon==
In 2011, Thibaut drew on his successful technique with children by offering friendly, situationally relevant classes through his French Language Salon® classes for adults. Thibaut’s new adult method immediately integrates grammar and conversation, rather than teaching them as separate disciplines. Thibaut’s former child students often attend his adult classes to practice French for social and professional purposes. Thibaut also designed a test preparation program for students of varying levels who are working to pass in exams focused on French as a second language and comply with the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]].

Thibaut specializes in different types of test preparation that merge his original French teaching style with patterns that correlating to the pertaining exam (SAT, AP French, CEFRL, and Canadian TEF.)  He combines his French education experience with an understanding of the exams and their tendencies, inspired by the, “life-hack,” movement and applied to a more academic and professional sphere.

==Technology==
With the growth of technology at the turn of the new century, Thibaut expanded his outreach platforms beyond the classroom by producing his [[Professor Toto]] Language Education Series for children, available in original CD/DVD and downloadable formats through Amazon, as well as making his language lessons and test prep services available via Skype.

'''Ghent University''' ({{lang-nl|Universiteit Gent}}, abbreviated as '''UGent''') is a [[Public university|public]] research [[university]] located in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]]. It was established in 1817 by [[King William I of the Netherlands|King William I]] of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]]. After the [[Belgian revolution]] of 1830, the newly formed Belgian state began to administer the university. In 1930, it became the first [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking university in Belgium, whereas [[French language|French]] had previously been the standard academic language. In 1991, the university was granted major autonomy and changed its name accordingly from ''State University of Ghent'' ({{lang-nl|Rijksuniversiteit Gent}}, abbreviated as ''RUG'') to its current designation.

In contrast to the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1835–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] or the [[Free University of Brussels]], UGent considers itself a ''pluralist'' university in a special sense, i.e. not connected to any particular religion or political ideology. Its motto '''Inter Utrumque''' ('In Between Both Extremes'), on the coat of arms, suggests the acquisition of wisdom and science comes only in an atmosphere of peace, when the institution is fully supported by the monarchy and fatherland.

Ghent University is one of the biggest [[Flanders|Flemish]] universities, consisting of 41,000 students and 9,000 staff members. The University also supports the [[Ghent University Library|University Library]] and the [[Ghent University Hospital|University Hospital]], which is one of the largest hospitals in Belgium. It is one of the greatest beneficiaries of funding from the [[Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO)]]. Ghent University consistently rates among the top universities not only in Belgium but also throughout the world.

== History ==

=== Foundation, in the 19th century ===
The university in Ghent was opened on October 9, 1817, with JC van Rotterdam serving as the first [[Rector (academia)|rector]]. In the first year, it had 190 students and 16 professors. The original four faculties consisted of Humanities (Letters), Law, Medicine and Science, and the language of instruction was [[Latin]]. The university was founded by [[King William I of the Netherlands|King William I]] as part of a policy to stem the intellectual and academic lag in the southern part of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], later to become Belgium.

After peaking at a student population of 414, the number of students declined quickly following the [[Belgian Revolution]]. At this time, the Faculties of Humanities and Science were broken from the university, but they were restored five years later, in 1835. 
Ghent University played a big role in the foundation of modern organic chemistry. Friedrich [[August Kekulé]] (7 September 1829 – 13 July 1896) unraveled the structure of benzene at Ghent and [[Adolf von Baeyer]] (Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von Baeyer), a student of [[August Kekulé]], made seminal contributions to organic chemistry.

In 1882, Sidonie Verhelst became the first female student at the university.

French became the language of instruction, taking the place of Latin, after the 1830 Revolution. In 1903, the Flemish politician [[Lodewijk De Raet]] led a successful campaign to begin instruction in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and the first courses were begun in 1906.

=== Developments since the 20th century ===
During [[World War I]], the occupying German administration conducted ''[[Flamenpolitik]]'' and turned Ghent University into the first Dutch-speaking university in Belgium. A Flemish Institute (''Vlaemsche Hoogeschool''), commonly known as [[Von Bissing University]], was founded in 1916 but was disestablished after the war and French language was fully reinstated. In 1923, Cabinet Minister [[Pierre Nolf]] put forward a motion to definitively establish the university as a Dutch-speaking university, and this was realized in 1930. [[August Vermeylen]] served as the first rector of a Dutch-language university in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,880570,00.html A Language Come Back], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', April 28, 1923&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[World War II|Second World War]], the German administration of the university attempted to create a German orientation, removing faculty members and installing loyal activists. However, the university became the focal point for many resistance members as the war progressed.
[[File:Ghent_University_1910_-_Studentenvereniging_Société_Académique_d'Histoire.jpg|thumb|Ghent University 1910 - Studentenvereniging Société Académique d'Histoire]]
After the war, the university became a much larger institution, following government policy of democratizing higher education in Flanders during the 1950s and 1960s. By 1953, there were more than 3,000 students, and by 1969 more than 11,500. The number of faculties increased to eleven, starting with Applied Sciences in 1957. It was followed by Economics and Veterinary Medicine in 1968, Psychology and Pedagogy, as well as Bioengineering, in 1969, and Pharmaceutical Sciences. The faculty of Politics and Social Sciences is the most recent addition, in 1992.

In the 1960s to 1980s, there were several [[student activism|student demonstrations]] at Ghent University, notably around the [[Blandijn]] site, which houses the Faculty of Arts &amp; Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = January 10, 2012|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The severest demonstrations took place in 1969 in the wake of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]].

The university officially changed its name from ''Rijksuniversiteit Gent'' (RUG) to ''Universiteit Gent'' (UGent) in 1991 following an increased grant of autonomy by the government of the [[Flemish Community]].

In 2017, Rik Van de Walle succeeded Anne De Paepe as rector.

==Academic Profile==

=== Organisation and structure ===
Ghent University consists of eleven [[Faculty (division)|Faculties]] with over 130 individual departments. In addition, the university maintains the [[Zwijnaarde science park]] and [[Greenbridge science park]].

'''Harish Chandra Verma''' (born 3 April 1952) is an Indian [[experimental physicist]] and  a retired professor at the [[Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur]] since 1994. His field of research is [[nuclear physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://iitk.ac.in/new/h-c-verma | title=Profile of DR. H. C. Verma | publisher=''Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur'' | accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has authored several books on physics at the graduate, undergraduate and school levels. His most popular work is the two-volume book ''[[Concepts of Physics]]''. He has co-founded initiatives like ''Shiksha Sopan'' for the social upliftment of the children of the economically weaker section living near the IITK campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2014/20140831/spectrum/main2.htm | title=Spreading the light of knowledge | date=31 August 2014 | accessdate=19 September 2014 |publisher=''[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his website, he is currently working on a book dealing with [[electrostatics]], [[magnetostatics]] and [[electrodynamics]] at the undergraduate level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.iitk.ac.in/~hcverma/Bookunderpub.htm|title=Electromechanics|publisher=iitk.ac.in|website=HC Verma's webpage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early education==
H. C. Verma spent most of his childhood in [[Patna]] and this can be reflected in some texts in his book. He was trained in basic arithmetic by his father Shri Ganesh Prasad Verma, a teacher. Verma has been through the sweet and sour experiences of India's school education system, and this gave him low interest towards studies throughout his school years; until high school, due to which he even struggled to pass his exams. After he graduated high school, he entered [[Patna Science College]], which was a place that moulded this normal school boy into a confident and bright adolescent.&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singh|first1=Jitender|title=Biography of Dr. H. C. Verma|url=http://www.concepts-of-physics.com/dr-hc-verma/biography.php|website=www.concepts-of-physics.com|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formative years==

Patna Science College's environment was totally different than his former school. The teachers were bright, enthusiastic and encouraging. As a student who struggled for passing marks was changed into a third place student in Patna University, receiving a B.Sc. (Honours) degree in Physics. From 1975 to 1977, Verma joined the IIT Kanpur for a M.Sc. and was placed as a top student with a performance index of 9.9 out of 10.0. He then chose to remain at IIT Kanpur for his doctorate. Verma received a PhD degree in less than three years.

==Career==

===Patna Science College===
In 1980, Verma joined the reputed [[Patna Science College]] as a lecturer. He remained in Patna Science college as a lecturer and reader for 15 years before coming to [[IIT Kanpur]].

===IIT Kanpur===

Dr. Verma joined IIT Kanpur in 1994 as assistant professor. Here, he taught many courses, guided M. Sc. and PhD students, authored a book "Quantum Physics", and pursued research in experimental nuclear physics. While at IIT Kanpur, apart from his regular assignments, he took many socio-educational initiatives for the benefit of education and society. Some of these initiatives are [http://home.iitk.ac.in/~hcverma/Introduction.htm School Physics Project], [http://www.shiksha-sopan.org/ Siksha Sopan], and [http://www.utsahiphysicsteachers.com/ Utsahi Physics Teachers]. He retired from formal teaching on 30 June 2017, after 38 years in Teaching Physics.

===Publications===
He has published 139 research papers for various journals. He has also written several books on Physics for school and intermediate levels. Of these, Concepts of Physics has become a widely known and recommended book on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Verma|first1=H C|url=http://www.hcverma.in/ReadMore|website=H C Verma|accessdate=10 April 2018|title=Prof. H C Verma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
India is believed to have had a functioning system of higher education as early as 1000 B.C.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chitnis|first=Suma|date=Feb 3, 2000|title=Higher Education in India|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/194193481?accountid=14496|journal=Black Issues in Higher Education|volume=16|pages=28|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike present day universities, these ancient learning centers were primarily concerned with dispersing Vedic education.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/978-1-137-53571-9|title=A History of the Indian University System {{!}} SpringerLink|last=Datta|first=Surja|language=en-gb|doi=10.1057/978-1-137-53571-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern Indian education system finds its roots in colonial legacy.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dNKcOxvwfV0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20higher%20education%20in%20India|title=History and Development of Higher Education in India|last=Sharma|first=Shaloo|date=2002|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|isbn=9788176253185|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Government used the university system as a tool of cultural colonization.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Colonial efforts in higher education were carried out initially through the [[East India Company]], followed by the British parliament and later under direct British rule.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The first institution of higher learning set up by the British East India Company was the Calcutta Madrasa in 1781. This was followed by the [[The Asiatic Society|Asiatic Society]] of Bengal in 1784, Benaras Sanskrit College in 1791 and [[Fort William College]] in 1800.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; With the Charter Act of 1813, the British Parliament officially declared Indian education as one of the duties of the state.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; The same act also removed restrictions on missionary work in British India, thus leading to the establishment of the evangelist Serampore College in 1818.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; [[Thomas Babington Macaulay|Thomas Babbington Macaulay’]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s famously controversial Minute on Education (1835) reflected the growing support of a Western approach to knowledge over an Oriental one.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Soon after, in 1857, the first three official universities were started in Bombay (Mumbai), Calcutta (Kolkata) and Madras (Chennai). These universities were modeled after the University of London and focused on English and the humanities&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-4012-2_38|title=International Handbook of Higher Education|last=Jayaram|first=N.|date=2007|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|isbn=9781402040115|series=Springer International Handbooks of Education|pages=747–767|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-4012-2_38.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British control of the Indian education system continued until the [[Government of India Act, 1935|Government of India Act of 1935]] that transferred more power to provincial politicians and began the "Indianisation" of education. This period witnessed a rise in the importance of physical and vocational education as well as the introduction of basic education schemes.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; When India gained independence in 1947, the nation had a total of 241,369 students registered across 20 universities and 496 colleges. In 1948, the Indian Government established the University Education Commission to oversee the growth and improvement of higher education.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, the government increased its efforts to support higher education by not only setting up state-funded universities and colleges, but also providing financial assistance to private institutions, resulting in the creation of private aided/ grant-in-aid institutions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Agarwal|first=Pawan|date=2007-04-01|title=Higher Education in India: Growth, Concerns and Change Agenda|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2273.2007.00346.x/abstract|journal=Higher Education Quarterly|language=en|volume=61|issue=2|pages=197–207|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2273.2007.00346.x|issn=1468-2273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the leave of the British, Indian higher education continued to give importance to the languages and humanities until the 1980s. Institutes of professional education like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), Regional Engineering Colleges (REC) and Indian Institutes of Management (IIM) were some of the more prominent exceptions to this trend. These institutions drew inspiration from reputed universities in the United States and also received foreign funding. Post 1980s, the changing needs of the economy, a growing middle class and an increased strain on government financial resources, slowed the growth of state-funded higher educational institutions. This led to an increased role of the private sector in the education system.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Universities==
{{see also|University Grants Commission (India)}}
Universities in India have evolved in divergent streams with each stream monitored by an apex body, indirectly controlled by the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Ministry of Human Resource Development]] and funded jointly by the state governments. There are Most universities are administered by the States, however, there are 18 important universities called Central Universities, which are maintained by the Union Government. The increased funding of the central universities give them an advantage over their state competitors.

The University Grants Commission estimated that in 2013–14, 22,849 PhDs and 20,425 MPhil degrees were awarded. Over half of these were in the fields of Science, Engineering/Technology, Medicine and Agriculture. {{as of|2014}}–15, over 178,000 students were enrolled in research programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/2465555_Annual-Report-2014-15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the several hundred state universities, there is a network of research institutions that provide opportunities for advanced learning and research leading up to a PhD in branches of science, technology and agriculture. Several have won international recognition.

25 of these institutions come under the umbrella of the CSIR – Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and over 60 fall under the ICAR – Indian Council of Agricultural Research. In addition, the DAE – Department of Atomic Energy, and other ministries support various research laboratories.

The [[National Institutes of Technology|National Institute of Technology]] (NITs), [[Indian Institutes of Information Technology]] (IIITs), [[Indian Institute of Technology|Indian Institutes of Technology]]  are among the most prestigious institutions within the technology sciences. [[Indian Institute of Science]] (IISc) and [[Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research|Indian Institute of Science Education and Research]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-03-26|title=India|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v519/n7544_supp_ni/full/519S66a.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=519|issue=7544|pages=S66–S67|doi=10.1038/519S66a|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;(IISERs) are the premier research institutes in the field of science education and research. There are several thousand colleges (affiliated to different universities) that provide undergraduate science, agriculture, commerce and humanities courses in India. Amongst these, the best also offer post graduate courses while some also offer facilities for research and PhD studies.

Technical education has grown rapidly in recent years. Of 27.3 million students enrolled in undergraduate studies, about 4.5 million are in engineering fields.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With recent capacity additions, it now appears that the nation has the capability to graduate over 500,000 engineers (with 4-yr undergraduate degrees) annually, and there is also a corresponding increase in the graduation of computer scientists (roughly 50,000 with post-graduate degree). In addition, the nation graduates over 1.2 million scientists. Furthermore, each year, the nation is enrolling at least 350,000 in its engineering diploma programs (with plans to increase this by about 50,000). Thus, India's annual enrollment of scientists, engineers and technicians now exceeds 2 million.

Across the country, tertiary enrollment rates have increased at a [[compound annual growth rate]] of 3.5% in the 5 years preceding 2016. Current enrollment stands at 34.58 million, over 15% more than the 29.2 million enrolled in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2017, THES ranked the [[Indian Institute of Science]] as the eighth best "small university" in the world. A small university was defined as one with less than 5000 students. In 2015, the institute also became the first Indian institute to make it to the top hundred in the THES list of engineering institutes. It was ranked 99.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/iisc-becomes-1st-indian-university-to-be-ranked-among-top-10-in-world/articleshow/57504702.cms|title=IISc becomes first Indian university to be ranked among top 10 in world – Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anna University]], which is of the affiliated type, is a member of the [[Association of Indian Universities]], the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]] and Partner of UNESCO International Center for Engineering Education (UICEE). [[University Grants Commission (India)|UGC]] have accredited Anna University with Five Star Status in 2002 which is the highest rating. With proven capabilities both in academic and research areas, Anna University was able to receive this honour for a period of five years for excellence in technical education.

The [[University of Calcutta]]  was the first multi-disciplinary university of modern India. According to The Times Higher Education Supplement's survey of the world's top arts and humanities universities, dated November 10, 2005, this university, ranked 39, was the only Indian university to make it to the top 50 list in that year. Other research institutes are the [[Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics]], the [[Asiatic Society]], and the [[Indian Statistical Institute]].

The [[National Law School of India University]] is highly regarded, with some of its students being awarded [[Rhodes Scholarship]]s to [[Oxford University]], and the [[All India Institute of Medical Sciences]] is consistently rated the top medical school in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/full.asp?fodname=20070611&amp;fname=APemchand+Palety&amp;sid=2 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120908022718/http://www.outlookindia.com/full.asp?fodname=20070611&amp;fname=APemchand+Palety&amp;sid=2 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-08 |title=outlookindia.com – more than just the news magazine from India |work=outlookindia.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indian Institutes of Management|Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs)]] are the top management institutes in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/full.asp?fodname=20080929&amp;fname=ALead+Essay&amp;sid=2 |title=outlookindia.com – more than just the news magazine from India |work=outlookindia.com/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925224453/http://www.outlookindia.com/full.asp?fodname=20080929&amp;fname=ALead+Essay&amp;sid=2 |archivedate=25 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The private sector is strong in Indian higher education. This has been partly as a result of the decision by the Government to divert spending to the goal of universalisation of elementary education. Within a decade different state assemblies have passed bills for private universities, including [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science]], [[Institute of Finance and International Management]], [[XLRI|Xavier Labour Relations Institute]], [[ICFAI University, Dehradun]], [[O. P. Jindal Global University]] and many more.

India is also the leading source of international students around the world. More than 200,000 Indian students are studying abroad. They are likely to be enrolled in master's programs with engineering focus which provide them opportunities to enhance career potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://resources.interedge.org/2016/01/18/indian-students-career-us-stem-opt-master/|title=Three ways Indian students maximize the career potential in the US higher education|last=Choudaha|first=Rahul|last2=Hu|first2=Di|date=2016-01-18|website=interEDGE.org|publisher=DrEducation|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accreditation===
Indian law requires that universities be accredited unless created through an act of Parliament. Without accreditation, the government notes, "These fake institutions have no legal entity to call themselves as University/Vishwvidyalaya and to award ‘degree’ which are not treated as valid for academic/employment purposes."&lt;ref name="cu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.nic.in/htmlweb/he-centraluniversities-list.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009183806/http://www.education.nic.in/htmlweb/he-centraluniversities-list.htm|title=Central Universities|archivedate=9 October 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of assessing and assuring quality of Indian higher education is a challenge. Instead of aiming for 'world-class' universities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dreducation.com/2010/10/india-world-class-universities.html|title=Why does India lack world-class universities? ~ DrEducation: Global Higher Education Research|last=Choudaha|first=Rahul|publisher=DrEducation|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; through rankings, policy framework must improve the processes that enable accountability through data collection and reporting on parameters of institutional quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20160503182610693|title=Rankings should be used to increase quality for all – University World News|last=Dietrich|first=Erich|last2=Choudaha|first2=Rahul|publisher=University World News|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government should leverage this tool to improve quality of the overall system.

A study was done on autonomous colleges by the Centre for Public Policy Research (CPPR) in Kerala recommended that grading should be done for such institutions to improve their overall performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/Autonomous-yes-but-no-freedom-for-colleges/articleshow/54727281.cms|title=Autonomous yes, but no freedom for colleges – Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Administration ==
The institutional framework of higher education in India consists of Universities and Colleges.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;[http://www.iiste.org/Journals/index.php/JEP/article/viewFile/1146/1067 Gupta], Deepti, Navneet Gupta, and Mandir Marg. “Higher Education in India: Structure, Statistics and Challenges.” ''Journal of Education and Practice'' 3, no. 2 (2012): 9.&lt;/ref&gt; As reported in 2015, India has 760 universities and 38,498 colleges.&lt;ref&gt;MHRD, [http://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/document-reports/AR_2015-16%20ENGLISH.pdf Annual Report on Higher Education in India- 2015-2016].&lt;/ref&gt; There are three types of universities: Conventional Universities, Deemed Universities and Institutions of National Importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ranjan Ravi|first=Naveen|date=2015|title="Structure and Organisation of Higher Education in India : A Macro-Perspective"|url=http://ccemohali.org/img/Ch%203%20Dr%20Naveen.pdf|journal=Indian Journal of Educational Studies : An Interdisciplinary Journal|volume=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Conventional Universities are established through Act of Parliament or State Legislatures, Deemed Universities award degrees through the notification of the central government. Institutes of National Importance are those that have been awarded the status by Parliament.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The education system of India falls broadly under the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development]](MHRD). Amongst the branches of the MHRD, the Department of Higher Education is responsible for overseeing the growth of the higher education sector. The Department aims to improve quality of and access to higher education for all sections of the population.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mhrd.gov.in/overview|title=About Department Of Higher Education {{!}}  Government of India, Ministry of Human Resource Development|website=mhrd.gov.in|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key objectives of the Department is to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education to 30% by 2020. Some of the other objectives of the department include: expansion of institutional base, greater inclusion of minorities, removal of regional disparities, infrastructural improvement and increased global participation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Current government initiatives include:

* '''Rashtriya Uchattar Shiksha Abhiyan''' - A total of 316 state public universities and 13,024 colleges will be covered under the Rashtriya Uchattar Shiksha Abhiyan, a plan to manage funding for higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Govt launches Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan for bouldering Higher Education|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2013/10/govt-launches-rashtriya-uchchatar-shiksha-abhiyan-for-bouldering-higher-education/|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a scheme to develop state university by central govt funding (60% for general category states, 90% for special category states, 100% for union territories).
* '''Scheme of Integrating Persons With Disabilities In The Mainstream Of Technical And Vocational Education''' - Caters to around 50 polytechnics in the country and provides them with grants-in-aid aimed at facilitating greater integration of disabled individuals into higher education.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mhrd.gov.in/higher_education|title=Department of Higher Education {{!}}  Government of India, Ministry of Human Resource Development|website=mhrd.gov.in|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Scheme of Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya National Mission on Teachers and Teaching (PMMMNMTT)''' - The purpose of this scheme is to raise the quantity and quality of teaching staff across schools and colleges. It also aims to create better institutional frameworks in order to cultivate change in the positive direction.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

== Rankings ==
{{expand_section|date=August 2012}}
{{update|date=July 2017}}

== Challenges ==
In the last 30 years, higher education in India has witnessed rapid and impressive growth. The increase in the number of institutions is, however, disproportionate to the quality of education that is being dispersed.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eaber.org/node/22139|title=Higher Education in India - The Need for Change {{!}} EABER|website=www.eaber.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unplanned over-expansion is often criticized as one of the biggest downfalls of Indian higher education.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/536293795|title=Indian higher education : envisioning the future|last=Pawan.|first=Agarwal,|date=2009|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9788178299419|location=New Delhi|oclc=536293795}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of institutions suffer from subpar quality and a lack of funding. As a result, entry into the top institutions is highly competitive and translates into a contest for higher entrance test scores and better private coaching institutes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Higher education in India faces problems ranging from income and gender disparities in enrolment, to poor quality of faculty and teaching and even to a general lack of motivation and interest amongst students.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Industries cite skill shortage as one of the major factors contributing to the mounting number of unemployed graduates.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some of the main challenges faced by the Indian higher education system include:

*'''Financing''' – The inability of the state to fund the expanding higher education system has resulted in the rapid growth of private higher education.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In addition, diminished governmental financial support adversely affects small and rural educational institutions.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; A growing number of public institutions are forced to resort to self-financing courses and high tuition costs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The private sector's primary modes of financing include donations, capitation fees and exorbitant fee rates. This in turn limits general accessibility to higher education, by catering to only an elite few.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;
*'''Enrolment''' – As of &amp;nbsp;2007, only around 11% of the 18 – 23 year old population of India, is enrolled in higher education. On the whole, India has an enrolment rate of 9% which is similar to that of other lower middle income countries. The population that is enrolled in higher education consists largely of urban metropolitan dwellers. Rural enrolment in higher education is very low.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Moreover, a majority of the recorded enrolment is at the undergraduate level.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Over the last 4 years, Indian higher education has maintained a steady female enrolment rate of around 45%.&lt;ref&gt;Government of India. Ministry of Human Resource Development.(2016) ''[http://aishe.nic.in/aishe/viewDocument.action;jsessionid=8D110DE571B80AE0C267A24451FFCA0C?documentId=204 All India Survey on Higher Education: Higher Education Statistics at a Glance]''&lt;/ref&gt; Although the gender gap in enrolment has decreased significantly post-independence, there still exists a disparity amongst different departments. Technology, medicine and commerce are some of the areas of study that are heavily male-dominated while humanities departments show the opposite trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1002303793|title=Politics, policy and higher education in India|last=Roy,|first=Chowdhury, Sunandan|isbn=9789811050565|location=Singapore|oclc=1002303793}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Accreditation''' - Driven by market opportunities and entrepreneurial zeal, many institutions are taking advantage of the lax regulatory environment to offer 'degrees' not approved by Indian authorities, and many institutions are functioning as pseudo non-profit organisations, developing sophisticated financial methods to siphon off the 'profits'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20110722202005936|title=A crisis of confidence in higher education?|date=2011-07-24|publisher=universityworldnews.com|accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; Regulatory authorities like [[University Grants Commission (India)|UGC]] and [[All India Council for Technical Education|AICTE]] have been trying to extirpate private universities that run courses with no affiliation or recognition. Students from rural and semi-urban background often fall prey to these institutes and colleges.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120915024214/http://thinkahead.net.in/tips-for-verifying-fake-and-cheat-universities-in-india/111038.html/ ''Fake and Cheat Universities in India'', Think Ahead.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Politics''' - Higher education is a high stakes issue in India. It is subject to heavy government involvement. Despite the system's lack of state funding, 15.5% of government expenditure goes toward higher education.&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altbach|first=Philip G.|date=1993-07-01|title=The dilemma of change in Indian higher education|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01575104|journal=Higher Education|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=3–20|doi=10.1007/BF01575104|issn=0018-1560}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, many prominent political figures either own or sit on the managerial board of the Universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmad Sheikh|first=Younis|date=2017|title=Higher Education in India: Challenges and Opportunities|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1131773.pdf|journal=Journal of Education and Practice|volume=8|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the exertion of intense political pressures on the administration of these institutions.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; [[Caste system in India|Caste]] based reservations make Indian higher education an even more contested topic. While some make the case that caste-based quotas are necessary to tackle prevailing socio-economic disparities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghosh|first=Jayati|date=2006|title=Case for Caste-Based Quotas in Higher Education|jstor=4418343|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=41|issue=24|pages=2428–2432}}&lt;/ref&gt; others see it as exclusionary to upper-caste individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Politics, Policy and Higher Education in India {{!}} SpringerLink|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-981-10-5056-5.pdf|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-981-10-5056-5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, student activism and political organization of academic staff are widespread and rampant.

The complex socio-political nature of the education sector in India makes it difficult to implement social reform. As a result, the overall quality of education suffers.&lt;ref name=":122"/&gt;

== Student advisory ==
While fee regulatory agencies fix a fee that cover expenses incurred by an institution along with a basic surplus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frctech.ac.in/2011_NewFee/mba_frc.pdf|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrcmp.org/index.php/2015-11-25-08-40-18|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ojee.nic.in/publicinfo/Handler/FileHandler.ashx?i=File&amp;ii=98&amp;iii=Y|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; many institutions have been charging a fee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/others/thinkingan-mba-knowreal-costs_882184.html|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that makes the venture profiteering. All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), the regulatory body for technical education in India, has called "upon the students, parents and the general public not to pay any [[capitation fee]] or any other fee other than that mentioned in the Prospectus of the Institutions for consideration of admission."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aicte-india.org/downloads/notice_prohibition_capitation_fee.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; AICTE also mentions that the fee charged to students, including for programs such as PGDM, has to be approved by the fee regulatory committee of the state, and the institute should mention the fee on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aicte-india.org/downloads/ApprovalProcessHandbook2016-17.pdf|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per AICTE norms, the business schools are not meant to charge a fee higher than what is mentioned in the prospectus. Educational regulatory agencies, at the national level&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/1842250_deemedregulation2014.PDF|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the regional level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asckerala.org/sites/default/files/MBA%20DIRECTIVES%20ISSUED%20TO%20ALL%20SELF-FINANICNG%20MANAGEMENT%20INSTITUTUES%20ON%2011.05.2015.pdf|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; have mandated that an institution should include the fee in the prospectus.

'''Hurlstone Agricultural High School''' (abbreviated '''HAHS''') is an agricultural, [[Selective school (New South Wales)|selective]], [[co-educational]], [[Public school (government funded)|public]] [[high school]] located in [[Glenfield, New South Wales|Glenfield]], a [[South-western Sydney|south-western suburb]] of [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. It is the oldest government [[boarding school]] in New South Wales (NSW).&lt;ref name="smh_parents_demand"&gt;Patty, Anna (29 September 2007). [http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/parents-demand-answers-over-top-schools-finances/2007/09/28/1190486569816.html "Parents demand answers over top school's finances"]. ''Sydney Morning Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurlstone is unique in that it is the state's only public selective and agricultural school that also includes a coeducational boarding school. The 112 hectare campus includes [[classroom]] blocks, an operational [[farm]], sporting facilities and student accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Hurlstone+Agricultural+High+School/@-33.968491,150.885652,693m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x6b1294cae8e47a9d:0xee133fdeb37a1f82&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurlstone has been named the Macarthur region's best academic school, ranking 11th in the NSW top 200 list for the 2012 academic year.  The school had 148 distinguished achievers, 13 on the state's top achievers' list, eight on the all-rounders' list and three students who topped the state in a course. Students are required to sit the [[Selective High Schools Test]] in year 6 to be granted enrolment into the school. The allowance mark is usually between 200 and 205 in the Selective test (out of 300). Students can also gain entrance by sitting a similar exam in other grades.

== History ==
[[File:HAHSclass1913.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Manual training class, 1913]]
Hurlstone was established as a boys-only school in 1907 in [[Hurlstone Park, New South Wales|Hurlstone Park]], approximately ten kilometres south west of Sydney, at the present site of [[Trinity Grammar School, New South Wales|Trinity Grammar School]]. The original owner of the land was a teacher, John Kinloch, one of the first graduates of the [[University of Sydney]]. He named the land 'Hurlstone Estate', after his mother's maiden name and set up his own school on it in 1878 which he called the Hurlstone School and College.&lt;ref name=history&gt;Hurlstone Agricultural High School. [http://www.hurlstone.com.au/public/content/ViewCategory.aspx?id=11 School History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828224101/http://www.hurlstone.com.au/public/content/ViewCategory.aspx?id=11 |date=28 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In those days most students completed their schooling after [[primary school]] and students at 'Hurlstone Agricultural Continuation School' (as it was known at the time) studied there for only two years. In 1926 the school moved to its present site in Glenfield, approximately 42&amp;nbsp;km south-west of Sydney (between [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]] and [[Campbelltown, New South Wales|Campbelltown]]) and adjacent to [[Glenfield railway station, Sydney|Glenfield railway station]]. By then its student numbers had grown from 30 in 1907, to 148.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The school supported government policy to promote productivity in the agricultural sector through the training of boys in all aspects of [[agricultural science]]s and farm management.

For a brief period in the 1940s it was known as 'Macarthur Agricultural High School' in honour of wool-grower [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]], but it soon reverted to its previous name.

== Population ==
[[File:Hurlstone boarding school.jpg|thumb|The boarding school at sunset. Several dormitories, a kitchen, and dining room are visible.]]
Enrolment at the school is dependent on [[Selective school|selective examinations]] of Year 6 students from across the state. New students coming in later grades have to sit a similar exam.&lt;ref&gt;Enrolment section of:   http://www.hurlstone.com.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

The student population of about 975 is divided between boarder students (who reside on the school grounds and originate mainly from country NSW), and day students (who commute mostly from the south western Sydney region). The boarder-day student ratio is roughly 1:8. For sporting and accommodation purposes the school is divided into four [[House System|houses]]: [[William Farrer|Farrer]] (red), [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|Macarthur]] (yellow), [[William Wentworth|Wentworth]] (blue) and [[Lachlan Macquarie]] (green).

==Campus==
[[File:Hurlstone dairy.jpg|thumb|right|The school maintains a dairy with a milking herd of 38-45 cows and approximately 60 heifers, dry cows and calves.]]
Hurlstone Agricultural High School is located on a single [[campus]], covering the area from [[Glenfield railway station, Sydney|Glenfield railway station]], along Roy Watts Road and extending to sections of Quarter Sessions Road near the [[Hume Highway]]. Glenfield station is serviced by the T2 [[Airport, Inner West &amp; South Line]], the T5 [[Cumberland Line]] and the [[South West Rail Link]].

The school has several [[enclaves]], including the [[Department of Education and Communities (New South Wales)|Department of Education]] regional office and the [[Department of Public Works (New South Wales)|Department of Public Works]] office. It also has several specialty schools, Ajuga Primary School, Glenfield Park School and Campbell House High School. Ajuga and Campbell House are for students with behavioural issues that can’t go to their loca school (usually due to expulsion) while Glenfield Park is for students with disabilities.

Hurlstone features a fully functional [[farm]] and a commercial [[dairy]]. Animals on the farm include: [[Beef cattle|beef]] and [[Dairy cattle|dairy]] [[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[horse]]s, [[pig]]s, and [[chicken]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Farm section of:     http://www.hurlstone.com.au/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alpaca]]s, [[peacock]]s and [[bees]] were also formerly farmed.

The school's swimming pool is located adjacent to the boarding school, and was used for swimming carnivals, school sports and recreational purposes. Towards the end of 2012, the pool was closed down due to hygiene issues and cracks along the pool. Plans to rebuild the pool have been considered but no construction has started. It is currently assumed that the pool will never be repaired, due to the fact that the land on which it sits will no longer be a part of the new Roy Watts school after Hurlstone moves.

The boarding school has modern facilities, where boarders can sleep, study, exercise and hang around. Facilities include a well-being center, [[Aerobic exercise|cardio]] rooms, spacious [[dining hall]], a [[lecture theatre]], a [[common room]] and private [[dormitories]]. The day school also have facilities including [[classrooms]], [[toilets]], an [[oval]], [[Association football pitch|football fields]], careers office, music rooms, the John Edmondson hall, Covered Outdoor Learning Area, computer rooms, technology rooms, [[science lab]]s, [[dance studio]], [[horticulture]] area, [[volleyball court]], [[tennis court]]s, [[cricket nets]] and the Stanley Cook Memorial [[Library]].

Clarke House is a heritage listed building which houses Hurlstone's memorabilia museum.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flickr.com/photos/37523188@N00/646528871/&lt;/ref&gt;

On Roy Watts Road past the boarding school there is a memorial forest with trees planted in the shape of a cross. The memorial forest is where the Anzac Day and Remembrance day ceremonies are held.

As part of the 2008 mini-budget, the [[New South Wales Government]] declared 140 hectares of the school to be surplus to educational needs and the land will be sold in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andrewstoner.com.au/media/media-releases/labor-must-abandon-plans-to-sell-hurlstone-agricultural-high-schools-land.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914231958/http://www.andrewstoner.com.au/media/media-releases/labor-must-abandon-plans-to-sell-hurlstone-agricultural-high-schools-land.aspx |archivedate=14 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }} NSW Government Mini-Budget - Andrew Stoner&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to a strong public protest against this action,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southwestadvertiser.com.au/news/local/news/general/hurlstone-protest/1364300.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; an inquiry was led into process of selling approximately seven eighths of the school.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hurlstoneinquiry.nsw.gov.au {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309093010/http://www.hurlstoneinquiry.nsw.gov.au/ |date=9 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Mal Peters, the Inquiry Chair, recommended the school's agricultural sector to be upgraded in order to reflect current industry practice and standards due to it being an economic, wise and important public investment for the people of NSW as it supplies young scientists with the knowledge for the ever declining, but demanding agricultural sector of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hurlstoneinquiry.nsw.gov.au/downloads/final_report/intro.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309093330/http://www.hurlstoneinquiry.nsw.gov.au/downloads/final_report/intro.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2020 a new school called Hurlstone Agricultural High School will open at Western Sydney University, Hawkesbury.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dec.nsw.gov.au/about-the-department/our-reforms/innovative-education-successful-students/newschools/glenfield-educational-precinct/hurlstone-agricultural-hs&lt;/ref&gt; The existing school in Glenfield will be renamed Roy Watts High School (after Hurlstone alumni Roy Watts) and will remain fully selective but will no longer be an agricultural school. The farm land will be converted to a new public school as well as housing and a shopping center.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dec.nsw.gov.au/about-the-department/our-reforms/innovative-education-successful-students/newschools/glenfield-educational-precinct&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extracurricular activities ==
The school provides opportunities for students to engage in both co-curricular and extracurricular activities. Students may participate in certain clubs which promote these activities. Some groups are fairly unusual to public schools within the district, such as the [[Australian Army Cadets|Cadet corps]], [[Rotary Interact|Interact]] and Rural Youth. Hurlstone's Interact Club is the largest student run Interact in the Southern Hemisphere. [[Sport]] is an important part of extracurricular life at Hurlstone.
Hurlstone also participates in the Law Society of NSW's Mock Trial competition. The 2011 team came 2nd in the competition.

Other extracurricular activities at the school include the Prefects, HCF (Hurlstone Christian Fellowship), School SRC, Environment Committee, [[Debating]], [[Public Speaking]], Boarder Council, Pops [[Orchestra]], [[Musical ensemble|Ensemble]], [[Choir]], Hurlstone H. (Health) Youth, Archives, Safe Space and EPIC (Entertainment and Performing Arts Integrated Community). These groups help to improve the school in a number of ways from the environment to the entertainment sector.

London School of Economics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lse&gt;[http://www.helenerey.eu/SAP.aspx?pid=Bio_en-GB Bio] Homesite. LSE.  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6SAbv1SS2?url=http://www.helenerey.eu/SAP.aspx?pid=Bio_en-GB |date=2014-08-28 }} at WebCite.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was a member of the [[Conseil d'analyse économique]] which advises the [[French Prime Minister]] on economic matters 2010–2012. and is since 2012 a member of the Commission Economique de la Nation  which advises the [[Finance Minister of France]].&lt;ref name=lse/&gt;

== Economic research ==

Rey is credited with ground-breaking research into the structure of international payments and capital flows.  By examining the balance sheets of creditor and debtor nations, she offered new insights into relative returns on cross-border investments.  She explained her approach in an interview with the ''Financial Times'', which wrote, "She also showed why the US is the world's banker. "We called it 'the US's exorbitant privilege'. The US earns more on external assets than it pays on external liabilities. It has an excess return on the order of 2 per cent ... So it issues a lot of government bonds that are happily bought by the rest of the world."&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berglof|first1=Annie Maccoby|title=At home: Hélène Rey|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/c28e6128-cf62-11e2-be7b-00144feab7de.html#axzz3BiaFPn89|accessdate=3 September 2014|publisher=Financial Times|date=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Exorbitant Privilege"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rey and Gourinchas|title=From World Banker to World Venture Capitalist: US External Adjustment and The Exorbitant Privilege∗|journal=NBER Conference|date=August 2005|url=http://www.helenerey.eu/AjaxRequestHandler.ashx?Function=GetSecuredDOC&amp;DOCUrl=App_Data/helenerey_eu/Published-Papers_en-GB/_Documents_2012-13/72582505206_67186463733_exorbprivilegedec05.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4369">'''James Morningstar Young''' (1929 – June 4, 2008) was an [[United States|American]] [[White House]] [[physician]] for presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].

Born in [[Massillon, Ohio]], Young began his education in a one-room school house. He attended Massillon Washington High School and was captain of the football team during [[Paul Brown]]'s tenure as coach. He received a full scholarship to attend [[Duke University]], where he became captain of the football team and president of the student body government. While serving as the president of the student body, he was introduced to [[President Nixon]] for the first time. He was also a member of [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon|SAE]] and [[The Order of The Red Friars]]. After completing his degree in pre-medicine studies, he declined an offer to play for the [[NFL]] team, the [[LA Rams]], in California and opted to continue onto [[Duke University School of Medicine]] where he obtained his Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree.

Dr. Young was on active duty with the [[U.S. Navy]] for twenty years between 1955 and 1975. He served as medical director aboard the [[USS Northampton (CLC-1)|USS ''Northampton'']], where he met president [[John F. Kennedy]] for the first time. A couple of months after meeting President Kennedy, Young was asked to become the President's personal physician. Following the acceptance of the President's request, he was promoted to the rank of Captain in the Navy. 

Dr. Young only cared for the Kennedy family for several months before the president was [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassinated]] in 1963. On that day, Dr. Young was in the White House. When informed of the situation, Dr. Young went to the Secret Service Office where they were on the line with Dallas. After hearing how critical the President's wound was, he acknowledged the situation as hopeless, gestured a thumbs down to the room, and exited the room. He attended the President Kennedy's autopsy when his body returned to Washington, D.C. He slept in the White House for 3 nights following the assassination and then stayed with [[Jackie Kennedy]] at Camp David for 10 additional days- yet he never shared details from that time. He continued to remain in the White House as physician during President Johnson's term. He assisted with diagnosing LBJ with a poorly functioning gall bladder with stones; Johnson underwent surgery to remove his gall bladder in 1965. Dr. Young requested to transfer out of the White House in 1966.

Dr. Young was Vice President and Medical Director of Massachusetts Blue Cross for 12 years. He assisted with drafting of the [[Twenty-Fifth Amendment]] to the Constitution. He was a guest lecturer at [[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health]]. He also contributed to the book ''Managing Crisis: Presidential Disability and the Twenty-Fifth Amendment'' and appeared on the [[CNN]] special ''White House Doctors: The President's Shadow''.

Young died on June 4, 2008 due to complications following a stroke he suffered in May the same year.

The '''Jewish Big Sisters''' was a communal organization offering support to Jewish children arraigned in the [[Juvenile court|Children's Courts]] of New York City.&lt;ref name=register&gt;The Jewish communal register of New York City, 1917-1918, edited and published by the Kehillah (Jewish Community) of New York City. New York: Kehillah (Jewish Community) of New York City, 1918, p. 1144.&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1912,&lt;ref&gt;The Jewish communal register of New York City, 1917-1918 states the establishment year as 1913; The New York Times article featuring Mrs. Sidney C. Borg stated the establishment year as 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; it was an outgrowth of the [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America|Big Brothers Big Sisters]] movement (established in 1902) which sought to provide mentorship to boys (and eventually girls) who had gone through the Children's Courts. As more Jewish boys and girls found their way into the court system, support materialized for the formation of organizations first for boys and then for girls with the aim of preventing delinquency.

The Jewish Big Sisters was founded by Mrs. Sidney C. Borg, who as a volunteer in Children's Court lamented the lack of qualified staff to deal with growing numbers of girls she found in court. She established the organization with the recruitment of six volunteers to help deal with individuals cases.&lt;ref&gt;"Jewish Big Sisters To Mark 40th Year," ''New York Times, Nov. 12, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; The work of the Jewish Big Sisters involved visits to the home of the individual "little sister" in cooperation with the central office in order to work on specific cases.&lt;ref name=register/&gt; A professional would make preliminary visits and at the appropriate time, a big sister would be assigned to the individual. Frequent reports on progress were required. By 1917, the organization had a staff of 250.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;

Borg also lobbied for legislation to aid children. At a 40th anniversary celebration in 1952, she promoted concern about the designation of "[[juvenile delinquency|delinquent]]," pointing out that the term implied conviction of a felony although the individuals may not have been convicted of any crime. She also noted that, when she first started, children were classified as either "good" or "bad" but that now they were called "sick."

'''Katherine R. Whitmore''' (née '''Katherine Prue Reding''') ([[Kansas]], 1897-1982) was a [[Spanish literature]] professor at [[Smith College]]. She majored in Spanish language and literature at the [[University of Kansas]], and received her doctorate from [[University of California at Berkeley|Berkeley]]. She taught at a college in Richmond and, from 1930 on, at [[Smith College]]. She married Brewer Whitmore, another professor at Smith, in 1939. 

Whitmore spent the summer of 1932 and the 1934-1935 academic year in [[Madrid]], where she met poet [[Pedro Salinas]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cultura/gran/amor/secreto/Pedro/Salinas/elpepicul/20020407elpepicul_1/Tes/ El gran amor secreto de Pedro Salinas {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;  who fell in love with her. The relationship was the inspiration of Salinas' ''La voz a ti debida'' (1934), ''Razón de amor'' (1936), and ''Largo lamento'' (1939). Salinas' love letters to Whitmore from 1932 to 1947, kept at [[Houghton Library]] in [[Harvard University]], were published in 2002 as ''Cartas a Katherine.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/24/resources/1588 Pedro Salinas letters to Katherine Prue Reding Whitmore]." Cambridge, Massachusetts: Houghton Library, Harvard College Library, retrieved online October 17, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Whitmore specialized in [[Generation of '27]] literature, which means that she was required to teach the poetry written for her to her students. She wrote several books, including ''The Generation of 1898 in Spain as Seen Through Its Fictional Hero'' (1936), and ''Handbook of Intermediate Spanish'' (1942).

'''Kentucky Music Educators Association''' ('''KMEA''') is the [[Kentucky]] [[The National Association for Music Education#Affiliates|state-level affiliate]] of [[The National Association for Music Education]].  KMEA consists of over 1,000 professional music educators at all levels from kindergarten to the university level. It serves as a voice for Kentucky's music educators, and it maintains an active involvement with groups such as the [[Kentucky Citizens for the Arts]], [[The Kentucky Alliance for the Arts]], and [[The Kentucky Coalition for the Arts]].

==Mission statement==
"To advance the cause of music education throughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky by encouraging the study and making of music by all of the population and by serving as a strong advocate for issues affecting the accomplishment of that mission."

==Programs==
;Choruses
Kentucky high school students are provided the opportunity to participate in "Kentucky All-State Choruses [SATB, SSAA, TTBB]."
For elementary and middle school children, KMEA offers the Kentucky Children's Chorus for grades 5–6, and two Kentucky Junior High Choruses for grades 7–9: a treble chorus and a mixed chorus.

;Bands and orchestras
Kentucky high school students also are provided the opportunity to participate in All-State Bands [Concert, Symphonic, Jazz], and the All-State Symphony Orchestra or the Commonwealth String Orchestra,  for which the students are chosen from a rigorous audition on their instruments.

;Marching band
See [[Kentucky State Marching Band Championships]]

;Assessments
KMEA provides opportunities for students to receive ratings for their performances as soloists or in small ensembles at district-level sites throughout the Commonwealth in what are called ''Solo and Ensemble Assessments.'' Qualified evaluators rate students performances, and they offers suggestions for improvement of their playing skills. For a student to participate in such event, his/her music teacher must be a member of the Kentucky Music Educators Association. ''Large Ensemble Assessment'' allow bands, orchestras and choral groups to play for evaluation at district-level sites. Bands or choirs receiving Distinguished (I) ratings may participate in the State Concert Band or State Choral Assessments held later in the spring of each year.

While he is best known as an [[inker]], Janson has frequently worked as a penciller and colorist.

==Early life==

==Career==
After a short stint as assistant to [[Dick Giordano]] in the early 1970s,&lt;ref name=MoCCA&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.moccany.org/content/education|title= Storytelling for Comics Artists|year= 2010|publisher= Museum of Comics and Cartoon Art|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100325021835/http://moccany.org/content/education|archivedate= March 25, 2010|deadurl= yes|quote= After a short stint as assistant to Dick Giordano in the early 1970s, Klaus Janson went freelance, working for several comics publishers as writer, penciler, inker and colorist.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janson's first credited comics artwork was published by [[Marvel Comics]] in ''[[Jungle Action]]'' #6 (Sept. 1973).&lt;ref name="GCD"&gt;{{gcdb|type=credit|search=Klaus+Janson|title=Klaus Janson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janson came to prominence as the inker over [[Sal Buscema]]'s pencils on ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]''. Since then he has freelanced on most of the major titles at Marvel and DC. In 1975 he began a long run as inker on ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'', running from #124 (Aug. 1975) to #196 (July 1983). With #171 the series went from bi-monthly to monthly; unable to handle the increased workload, then-writer/penciler [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] began increasingly relying on Janson for the artwork, sending him looser and looser pencils beginning with #173.&lt;ref name="Back21"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Cordier|first= Philippe|date= April 2007| title= Seeing Red: Dissecting Daredevil's Defining Years|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 21|pages= 33–60|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; By issue #185, Miller had virtually relinquished his role as Daredevil's artist, and was providing only rough layouts for Janson to pencil, ink, and color.&lt;ref name="Back21"/&gt; After Miller's departure, Janson drew the series by himself for four issues.

Janson began working for [[DC Comics]] in the early 1980s and inked [[Gene Colan]]'s pencils on ''[[Detective Comics]]'' and ''[[Jemm]], Son of Saturn''.&lt;ref name="GCD" /&gt; Janson was one of the artists on ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #400 (Oct. 1984)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Addiego|first = Frankie|title = ''Superman'' #400|journal = Back Issue!|issue = 69|pages = 68–70|publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing|date = December 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the contributors to the ''[[DC Challenge]]'' limited series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Greenberger|first= Robert|authorlink= Robert Greenberger|title= It Sounded Like a Good Idea at the Time: A Look at the ''DC Challenge!''|journal= Back Issue!|issue= 98|page= 37–38|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|date= August 2017|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; His collaboration with Miller on ''Daredevil'' would soon be eclipsed by a second collaboration between them, on ''[[The Dark Knight Returns|Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9|page= 219|quote =  It is arguably the best Batman story of all time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="250193">This is an alphabetical list of major titles produced by [[Coronet Films]], a leading [[educational film]] company from the 1940s through 1990s (when it merged with Phoenix Learning Group, Inc.). The majority of these films were initially available in the [[16mm film]] format. The company started offering [[VHS]] videocassette versions in 1979 in addition to films, before making the transition to strictly videos around 1986.

For space reasons, only a very select number of independently produced films that Coronet merely distributed, including many TV and British productions acquired for 16mm release within the United States, are included here. One example is a popular series, “World Cultures &amp; Youth”, which was actually produced in Canada, but with some backing by Coronet. Also included are those [[Centron Corporation]] titles released when Coronet owned them, although their back catalogue of films made earlier were reissued under the Coronet banner.

It was quite common for a film to be re-released as a “2nd edition” with only minor changes in the edit and a different soundtrack, with music and narration styles changed to fit the changing times. This was especially true in the 1970s, when classrooms demanded more stimulating cinematic lectures. Quite often, only the newest edition of a film is available today. Those titles involving more serious edit changes or actual re-filming are listed as separate titles. In most cases, additional information is provided in the “year / copyright date” column.

===2011 legislative session===
In the 2011 legislative session the Democrats were in a slim minority: 33 Republicans, 32 Democrats in the State House.  Court served as a member of the House State, Veterans, and Military Affairs Committee, The House Judiciary Committee and the House Services Committee.  In addition, she was elected by her Democratic colleagues to serve as Minority Caucus Chair.  As Caucus Chair she is a member of the Democratic leadership team and organizes caucus gatherings and chairs discussions.

Her major piece of legislation in 2011 was SCR 11-001, a concurrent resolution to increase the threshold for constitutional change in Colorado.

===2012 legislative session ===
In the 2012 legislative session the Democrats were in a slim minority: 33 Republicans, 32 Democrats in the State House.

Her major piece of legislation in 2012 was HCR 12-1003: Concerning our State Constitution and Raising the Standards Required for Changing It.  This concurrent resolution would have changed the way and ease with which the Colorado Constitution can be changed.

===2012 election===

As Caucus Chair she is a member of the Democratic leadership team and organizes caucus gatherings and chairs discussions.

Court had two major pieces of legislation in 2013.  HB 13-1228: Payment for Background Checks for Gun Transfers - this bill imposes a small fee, around $12, for performing an instant criminal background check upon the purchaser of a gun. Previously, the state provided a subsidy to gun purchasers for this fee.

Her other major piece of legislation was SB 13-226: The Dog Protection Act.  This bill aims to reduce the number of dogs shot by officers of municipal police departments and sheriffs’ offices by requiring local law enforcement agencies to develop training programs to prepare local law enforcement officers for encounters with dogs in the line of duty. This training will emphasize how to recognize common dog behaviors and how to employ nonlethal methods to control or respond to dogs.

'''Midnight breakfast''' is a generic term for a [[communal meal]] served at some [[United States|American]] [[college]]s and [[universities]], often served during finals week.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.holycross.edu/blog/2017/05/10/administrators-to-serve-midnight-breakfast-to-students-during-finals-week-4/|title=Administrators to Serve Midnight Breakfast to Students During Finals Week {{!}} College of the Holy Cross|website=news.holycross.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://offices.depaul.edu/student-affairs/events/Pages/midnight-breakfast.aspx|title=Midnight Breakfast - Tuesday, November 13  {{!}}  Events  {{!}}  Division of Student Affairs {{!}} DePaul University, Chicago|website=offices.depaul.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.odessa.edu/announcements/MidnightBreakfastSpring2018.html|title=Odessa College - Midnight Breakfast|last=College|first=Odessa|website=www.odessa.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Menu items that are generally considered [[breakfast]] foods are served in the school's [[dining hall]] late at night (hence "[[midnight]]") as a [[study break]] before or during [[final exam]]s, or as a traditional community-building event. Sometimes food is served by faculty and staff.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Midnight breakfast is an occasional event and should not be confused with school dining facilities that operate 24 hours a day on a regular basis.

The '''Ministry of Education and Science''' ({{lang-bg|Министерство на образованието и науката}}, ''Ministerstvo na obrazovanieto i naukata'') of [[Bulgaria]] is the [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] charged with regulating and promoting the [[education]]al and [[science|scientific]] work in the country. It was founded as the Ministry of Popular Enlightenment in 1879 and existed under this name until 1947, after which it changed its name numerous times. In 2009 the name changed from "Ministry of Education and Science" to "Ministry of Education, Youth and Science". In 2013, this change was reversed.

&lt;/ref&gt; the {{lang|gl|mooinjer veggey}} are small creatures from two to three feet (600 to 900 mm) in height, otherwise very like mortals. They wear red caps and green jackets and are most often seen on horseback followed by packs of little hounds of all the colours of the rainbow. They are rather inclined to be mischievous and spiteful.&lt;ref&gt;

The phrase is borrowed by the [[Manx English|Anglo-Manx]] dialect to refer to fairies. Belief in fairies is or was formerly widespread in the Isle of Man. They live in green hillsides, more especially ancient tumuli. Anyone straying near these on a fine summer's evening would probably hear delightful music; but he must take care, especially if he is a musician, not to linger lest he should be entrapped. They are visible to people only when they choose. Some of them are benevolent, curing men of diseases and delivering them from misfortune. Others are malevolent, stealing children, even abducting adults, and bringing misfortune.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/fim/fim06.htm Moore, A.W., ''The Folk-Lore of the Isle of Man'', Brown &amp; Sons, London, 1891]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was an old custom to keep a fire burning in the house during the night, so that the Fairies might come in and enjoy it. It is said that on dark, dismal and stormy nights, in the mountain parts of parishes, the people would retire earlier to rest, in order to allow to the weather-beaten Fairies the unwatched enjoyment of the smouldering embers of the turf fire. It was also customary to leave some bread out for the Fairies, and to fill the water crocks with clean water for them before going to bed. This water was never used for any other purpose, but was thrown out in the morning. Manxwomen would not spin on Saturday evenings, as this was deemed displeasing to the Mooinjer-Veggey, and at every baking and churning a small piece of dough and butter was stuck on the wall for their consumption. Both salt and iron were considered efficacious against malevolent charms.&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;

==Manx language education==
{{lang|gv|'''Mooinjer Veggey'''}} is the name of a charity on the Isle of Man that operates several [[Manx language]] [[pre-school playgroup]]s and nurseries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mooinjerveggey.org.im/ {{lang|gv|Mooinjer Veggey}} - Official site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of helping young Manx children to grow up bilingual. The charity also operates a Manx language primary school, {{lang|gv|[[Bunscoill Ghaelgagh]]}}, at [[St John's, Isle of Man|St John's]], under contract from the [[Department of Education (Isle of Man)|Department of Education]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7443">The '''Ottoman Archives''' are a collection of historical sources related to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and a total of 39 nations whose territories one time or the other were part of this Empire, including 19 nations in the [[Middle East]], 11 in the [[European Union|EU]] and [[Balkan]]s, three in the [[Caucasus]], two in [[Central Asia]], [[Cyprus]], as well as [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and the [[Republic of Turkey]].

The main collection, in the ''Başbakanlık Osmanlı Arşivleri'' (The Prime Minister's Ottoman Archives) in [[Istanbul]], holds the central State Archives (''Devlet arşivleri'').

After more than a century in the center of the old city, the Ottoman state archives were relocated in 2013 to the Kağıthane district of Istanbul.

== History ==
The present collection contains a few documents from the earliest period up to the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Süleyman]] in the sixteenth century. The organization of these records as a modern archive began in 1847 with the establishment of ''Hazine-i Evrak''.&lt;ref name=hazine/&gt; The original building was located on the grounds of the grand vezir’s offices in Gülhane and contained several main groups of documents: the records of the Imperial Council (Divan-i Hümayun) and the records of the grand vezir’s office (Bab-i Ali), as well as the records of the financial departments (Maliye) and cadastral surveys (tapu tahrir defteri). [[Mustafa Reşid Paşa]] ordered the building a new record office in 1846.&lt;ref&gt;Gábor Ágoston, Bruce Masters, '''Prime Minister's Ottoman Archives''', ''Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire, Facts On File, Inc. 2009'']&lt;/ref&gt; It was completed by architect [[Fossati brothers|Gaspare T. Fossati]] in 1848. The office of "Surveillance of Treasury of Documents" was formed and Muhsin Efendi was appointed as its manager.

With the establishment of the Republic, the Hazine-i Evrak was transformed into ''Başvekalet Arşiv Umum Müdürlüğü''  (The General Directorate of the Prime Ministry) and eventually the Başbakanlık Arşiv Genel Müdürlüğü. During this period, the records of various nineteenth-century Ottoman offices and administrative authorities were added to the collections.

Concurrent with these changes and additions, Turkish scholars took the first steps to classify and catalog the various collections beginning in the 1910s. These early efforts produced a number of classified collections (tasnif) which are still cited according to the name of the scholar who created the catalog. Today the work of cataloging the vast collection continues.&lt;ref name=hazine&gt;[http://hazine.info/basbakanlik-arsivi/ Christopher Markiewicz and Nir Shafir, “The Ottoman State Archives”, Hazine, 10 October 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

After more than a century in the center of the old city, the Ottoman archives were relocated in 2013 to the [[Kağıthane]] district of Istanbul.

==The archives and the Armenian Genocide==
The Ottoman Archives not only contain information about the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman dynasty]] and the Ottoman state, but also about each nation that holds part of these resources. Though touted as being open to all researchers, scholars have complained about being prevented access to view documents due to the nature of their research topic.&lt;ref&gt;Sarafian, Ara. "The Ottoman Archives Debate and the Armenian Genocide," ''Armenian Forum'' 2 (Spring 1999): pp. 35-44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gingeras, Ryan (2009). ''Sorrowful Shores: Violence, Ethnicity, and the End of the Ottoman Empire, 1912-1923''. New York: Oxford University Press. p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theriault, Henry C. (2003). "Denial and Free Speech: The Case of the Armenian Genocide," in ''Looking Backward, Moving Forward: Confronting the Armenian Genocide'', ed. [[Richard G. Hovannisian]]. New Brunswick, NJ: Transactions Publishers,  p. 256, note 30.&lt;/ref&gt; However, plenty of [[Armenian Genocide]] researchers including the British-Armenian [[Ara Sarafian]], as well as [[Taner Akcam]] (known for his research on and acceptance of the Armenian Genocide) have used the Ottoman archives in Istanbul extensively when citing research for their books though they have made claims that obstacles were put during their access.&lt;ref&gt;Taner Akcam, ''The Young Turks Crime against Humanity: The Armenian Genocide and Ethnic Cleansing in the Ottoman Empire (Human Rights and Crimes Against Humanity)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarafian|first=Ara|title=The Ottoman Archives Debate and the Armenian Genocide|journal=Armenian Forum|date=Spring 1999|volume=2|issue=1|pages=34–44|url=http://anc.org.au/Articles/ottoman%20archives.pdf|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Parliament]] stressed in a resolution voted on 15 April 2015, that Turkey should use the commemoration of the centenary of the Armenian genocide as an important opportunity to recognize the Armenian Genocide and open its archives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20150413IPR41671/html/Armenian-genocide-centenary-MEPs-urge-Turkey-and-Armenia-to-normalize-relations Armenian genocide centenary: MEPs urge Turkey and Armenia to normalize relations]. [[European Parliament]]. 15 April 2015. Retrieved 15 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[WikiLeaks]] [[Diplomatic cable|cable]] 04ISTANBUL1074 [[classified information|classified]] and signed by David Arnett on July 4, 2004&lt;ref name=wikileaks&gt;[https://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/07/04ISTANBUL1074.html Viewing cable 04ISTANBUL1074, ARMENIAN "GENOCIDE" AND THE OTTOMAN ARCHIVES]. [[WikiLeaks]]. Retrieved 10 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Consulate]] General of the [[United States of America|US]] in Istanbul states, that Turkey has eliminated incriminating documents concerning the Armenian Genocide from the Archives:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''According to [[Sabanci University]] Professor [[Halil Berktay]], there were two serious efforts to purge the archives of any incriminating documents on the Armenian question.  The first took place in 1918, presumably before the Allied forces occupied [[Constantinople|Istanbul]]. Berktay and others point to testimony in the 1919 Turkish Military Tribunals indicating that important documents had been "stolen" from the archives. Berktay believes a second purge was executed 
in conjunction with Ozal's efforts to open the archives by a group of retired diplomats and generals led by former Ambassador Muharrem Nuri Birgi.''

'''Programmed Instruction, Learning, or Teaching''' ('''PILOT''') is a simple [[programming language]] developed in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="rpilot"&gt;{{Cite web |title= PILOT Resource Center |author= Rob Linwood |work= Sourceforge project |url= http://rpilot.sourceforge.net/pilot.html |accessdate= October 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like its younger sibling [[LOGO programming language|LOGO]], it was an early foray into the technology of [[computer-assisted instruction]].

==History==
PILOT was developed by [[John Amsden Starkweather]], a psychology professor at the [[University of California, San Francisco]] medical center. In 1962 he developed a simple language for automating learning tests called Computest. Starting in 1968, he developed a follow-on project called PILOT, for various computers of the time such as the [[SDS 940]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Register of the John A. Starkweather Papers, 1965-1985 |author= Xiuzhi Zhou |year= 1998 |publisher= University of California, San Francisco library |url= http://oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=tf2d5nb1xg;style=oac4;doc.view=entire_text |accessdate= October 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language syntax==

A line of PILOT code contains (from left to right) the following [[syntax]] elements:

* an optional [[Label (programming language)|label]]
* a command letter
* an optional Y (for yes) or N (for no)
* an optional conditional expression in parentheses
* a colon (":")
* an [[operand]], or multiple operands [[delimited]] by commas.

A label can also be alone in a line, not followed by other code.  The syntax for a label is an asterisk followed by an identifier (alphanumeric string with alphabetic initial character).

===Command letters===

The following commands are used in "core PILOT".  Lines beginning with "R:" indicate a remark (or a comment) explaining the code that follows.

; A: Accept [[Input/output|input]] into "accept [[Buffer (computer science)|buffer]]". Examples:

  R:Next line of input replaces current contents of accept buffer
  A:
  R:Next line of input replaces accept buffer, and [[string (computer science)|string]] [[variable (programming)|variable]] 'FREE'
  A:$FREE
  R:Next 3 lines of input assigned to string variables 'X', 'Y' and 'Z'
  A:$X,$Y,$Z
  R:Numeric input assigned to numeric variable "Q"
  A:#Q

; C: Compute and assign numeric value. Most PILOT implementations have only [[integer (computer science)|integer]] [[arithmetic]], and no [[Array data structure|arrays]].  Example:
&lt;tt&gt;
  R:Assign [[arithmetic mean]] of #X and #Y to #AM
  C:#AM=(#X+#Y)/2
&lt;/tt&gt;

; D: Dimension an array, on some implementations.

; E: End (return from) [[subroutine]] or (if outside of a subroutine) abort program.  Always used without any operand.

; J: Jump to label. Example:
&lt;tt&gt;
  J:*RESTART
&lt;/tt&gt;

; M: Match the accept buffer against string variables or [[string literal]]s. Example:
&lt;tt&gt;
  R:Search accept buffer for "TRUTH", the value of MEXICO and "YOUTH", in that order
  M:TRUTH,$MEXICO,YOUTH
&lt;/tt&gt;

The first match string (if any) that is a substring of the accept buffer is assigned to the special variable $MATCH.  The buffer [[character (computing)|character]]s left of the first match are assigned to $LEFT, and the characters on the right are assigned to $RIGHT.

The match flag is set to 'yes' or 'no', depending on whether a match is made.  Any statement that has a Y following the command letter is processed only if the match flag is set.  Statements with N are processed only if the flag is not set.

; N: Equivalent to TN:  (type if last match unsuccessful)

; R: The operand of R: is a [[comment (computer programming)|comment]], and therefore has no effect.

; T: 'Type' operand as output. Examples:
&lt;tt&gt;
  R:Output a literal string
  T:Thank you for your support.
  R:Output a variable expression
  T:Thank you, $NAME.
&lt;/tt&gt;

; U: Use (call) a subroutine.  A subroutine starts with a label and ends with E: Example:
&lt;tt&gt;
  R:Call subroutine starting at label *INITIALIZE
  U:*INITIALIZE
&lt;/tt&gt;

; Y: Equivalent to TY: (type if last match successful)

; Parentheses: If  there is parenthesized expression in a statement, it is a [[conditional (programming)|conditional]] expression, and the statement is processed only if the test has a value of 'true'. Example:
&lt;tt&gt;
  R:Type message if x&gt;y+z
  T(#X&gt;#Y+#Z):Condition met
&lt;/tt&gt;

==Derivatives==

Extensions to core PILOT include [[Array data structure|arrays]] and [[floating point]] numbers in [[Apple II family|Apple]] PILOT, and implementation of [[Logo programming language|LOGO]]-inspired [[turtle graphics]] in [[Atari]] PILOT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Atari PILOT for beginners |author=Jim Conlan, Tracy Deliman |publisher= Reston Publishing |year= 1983 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VujzAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1979 and 1983 the UK PILOT User Group was run by Alec Wood a teacher at Wirral Grammar School for Boys, Merseyside UK.  Several machine code versions of a mini PILOT were produced for the microcomputers of the time and a school in Scotland developed an interactive foreign language tutorial where pupils guided footprints around a town asking and answering questions in German, French etc. An article in Issue 1 December 1979 of Computer Age covered an early implementation called Tiny Pilot and gave a complete machine code listing.

Versions of PILOT overlaid&lt;!-- ??? --&gt; on the [[BASIC]] interpreters of early microcomputers were not unknown in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and [[Byte Magazine]] at one point published a non-[[Turing complete]] derivative of PILOT known as Waduzitdo by Larry Kheriarty as a way of demonstrating what a computer was capable of.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Waduzitdo 2001 |author= Brian Connors |date= April 6, 2001 |url= http://www.reocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Station/2266/tarpit/waduzitdo/wdzref.html |accessdate= October 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= WADUZITDO: How To Write a Language in 256 Words or Less |work= Byte |author= Larry Kheriarty |date= September 1978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 1983 product called Vanilla PILOT for the [[Commodore 64]] combined some features of LOGO,&lt;ref name="info"&gt;{{Cite news |title= Vanilla PILOT, PILOT that comes with turtle graphics |work= Infoworld |date= September 12, 1983 |pages= 67–69 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ry8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA67 |accessdate= October 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as did ''Super Turtle PILOT'' which was published as a type-in listing in the October 1987 issue of [[COMPUTE!]] magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue89/Super_Turtle_Pilot.php Atarimagazines.com - COMPUTE! Issue 89, October 1987, p74]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) published a standard for Pilot as IEEE Std 1154-1991. It has since been withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= IEEE Standard 1154-1991 for Programmed Inquiry, Learning, or Teaching (PILOT) |year= 1991 |publisher= IEEE Standards Committee  |url= http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/busarch/1154-1991_desc.html |doi= 10.1109/IEEESTD.1991.108548 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[reference implementation]] based on this was implemented by [[Eric Raymond]], and maintained—-reluctantly—-for the next 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Twenty years after |url= http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=7244 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 eSTeem PILOT for Atari ST computers was developed and programmed by Tom Nielsen, EdD. Based on the IEEE Standards for PILOT, it includes Atari-specific features such as control of Laserdisc and CDROM devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Press Release: eSTeem PILOT |url=http://www.atariarchives.org/cfn/06/08/03/0046.php }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application and Selection==
The selection process for the Park Scholarship is competitive.  Out of nearly 2,150 applicants, about 35 high school seniors will be selected as Park Scholars for the Class of 2021.

===Eligibility===
To be eligible for the Park Scholarships, candidates must be applying for fall, freshman admission into a baccalaureate program at NC State.  Successful applicants exhibit outstanding accomplishment and potential in the four tenets of scholarship, leadership, service, and character.

===Application Process===
Interested students may apply for the Park Scholarships Program in the Fall of their senior year of high school.  Students must either be endorsed by their high school (October 1 deadline) or self endorse (October 25 deadline) to apply.  Endorsed students may complete the Park Scholarships application supplement while applying for undergraduate admission to NC State.

===Selection Process===
Applications are evaluated on the basis of accomplishment and potential in scholarship, leadership, service, and character.  Of the almost 2,150 applicants for the Class of 2021, 400 Semifinalists were interviewed in January.  Of these 400 Semifinalists, 112 were identified as Finalists and interviewed during Finalist Weekend at NC State in February. Approximately 35 Finalists will be selected as Park Scholars for the Class of 2021. All Finalists who do not receive the Park Scholarship are offered a $10,000 scholarship provided by NC State.

'''Patrice A. Oppliger''' (born 26 August 1963),&lt;ref name=Congress&gt;{{cite web |title= Oppliger, Patrice A. |url= http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2003117540.html |publisher= Library of Congress |accessdate= 12 July 2014 |quote= (Patrice A.

Oppliger has written extensively about the impact of [[popular culture]] on student's high school years, and has been consulted by the media on the subject. Interviewed by [[CNN]] about cyberbullying, Oppliger discussed the film ''"[[Mean Girls]]"'', which is based on the book ''"[[Queen Bees and Wannabes]]"'' by [[Rosalind Wiseman]]. Oppliger accused the film of "glamorizing bad behavior", she went on to say that, "The book is a helpful guide to relationships between girls; the movie, on the other hand, showed the positive side of being a mean girl."&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leopold|first1=Todd|title=How to counter online bullies|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/30/tech/web/cyberbullying-vigilantes/|accessdate=12 July 2014|publisher=CNN|date=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WFXT|WFXT Fox25 News]] also interviewed Oppliger about [[Rockport High School|Rockport High School's]] decision to ban female students from wearing yoga pants. She said that the school ought to have judged the students on a "case-by-case" basis instead.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Presenter: unknown, Interviewee Patrice Oppliger | year = 2014 | title = WFXT Fox25 News | medium = Television | url = http://s3.amazonaws.com/TVEyesMediaCenter/UserContent/41689/2809782.5944/WFXT_02-07-2014_17.43.44.mp4 | accessdate = 12 July 2014 | time = 5.43am - 5.48am | timecaption = News item "School clothing concerns: should students be allowed to wear yoga pants to school?" | location = Boston | publisher = WFXT Fox25 | via = Amazon S3: online cloud storage | quote = I feel like they rush to judgment, they make this blanket statement about, "No yoga pants", without educating the students about exactly why, and what does it mean for their display of sexuality in school. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Practising Law Institute''' ('''PLI''') is a non-profit [[continuing legal education]] (CLE) organization chartered by the Regents of the University of the State of New York. Founded in 1933, the company organizes and provides CLE programs around the world. Its programs are held in multiple locations including New York, California, Illinois, Washington D.C., Georgia, Massachusetts, Texas, Pennsylvania, London, and Hong Kong.

Programs are also offered in various formats, including live webcasts, MP3s, and on-demand videos. PLI's headquarters are located in New York City, New York; it also maintains an office in San Francisco, California.

==History==
Founded in 1933, PLI was established to offer courses in the practice of law for lawyers recently admitted to the bar and/or those seeking to learn the elements of practicing in the field. As the country was seeing a transition from apprenticeship to formal law school education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regents.nysed.gov/about/history-professions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706002749/http://www.regents.nysed.gov/about/history-professions.html |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a New York City lawyer by the name of Harold Seligson recognized the need for practical training in law and originated a series of lectures called “Practising Law Courses.” These lectures would be the germination of the full-fledged Institute that exists today under the banner of the Practising Law Institute (PLI).

By 1939, the Institute had been formally chartered by the Regents of the State of New York. It was able to take advantage of certain historical forces, including the [[New Deal]] and the federal regulation of business activity it inspired. The [[Securities Act of 1933]] and the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], for example, initiated a new specialization in the law. This new specialization in turn created a need for a new kind of [[continuing legal education]], which we see in practice today.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sa33.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As a not-for-profit educational organization, PLI continues to offer pro bono programs and scholarships to lawyers and student in need of assistance. In 2012, PLI awarded over 26,000 scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pli.edu/emktg/Annual_Report2012/AnnualReport2012.html|title=AnnualReport2012|work=pli.edu|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27th, 2015 the PLI Board of Trustees formally installed Anita Carr Shapiro as its fifth president. She succeeded Victor J. Rubino who was unanimously approved as President Emeritus after serving as PLI's President since 1983. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/practising-law-institute-appoints-anita-carr-shapiro-as-president-and-victor-j-rubino-as-president-emeritus-300071956.html|title=Practising Law Institute Appoints Anita Carr Shapiro as President and Victor J.

'''Regent master''' (''Magister regens'') was a title conferred in the [[medieval universities]] upon a student who had acquired a [[master's degree]].  The degree meant simply the right to teach, the ''Licentia docendi'', a right which could be granted, in the [[University of Paris]], only by the [[Chancellor of the University of Paris|Chancellor]] of the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]], or the Chancellor of St. Geneviève. According to the [[Third Council of the Lateran|Third Council of Lateran]], held in 1179, this Licentia docendi had to be granted gratuitously, and to all duly qualified applicants.&lt;ref&gt;Catholic encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

If the new member stayed in the university and continued to take an active part in its teaching, he was called a ''magister regens'', a practising teacher. If he were to look for another career, however, he would become ''non regens'': a passive member of the corporation of masters, without losing his affiliation to it, which usually lasted for life.
An example of regent master was [[William Vorilong]], French philosopher of the Middle Ages.

[[Image:Ripley410112.gif|right|thumb|370px|[[Robert Ripley]]'s ''Believe It or Not'' (January 12, 1941)]]
'''''Ripley's Believe It or Not!''''' is an American franchise, founded by [[Robert Ripley]], which deals in bizarre events and items so strange and unusual that readers might question the claims. Originally a newspaper [[Panel (comics)|panel]], the ''Believe It or Not'' feature proved popular and was later adapted into a wide variety of formats, including [[radio]], [[television]], [[comic book]]s, a chain of museums, and a book series.

The Ripley collection includes 20,000 photographs, 30,000 artifacts and more than 100,000 cartoon panels. With 80-plus attractions, the [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]-based [[Ripley Entertainment|Ripley Entertainment, Inc.]], a division of the [[Jim Pattison Group]], is a global company with an annual attendance of more than 12 million guests. Ripley Entertainment's publishing and broadcast divisions oversee numerous projects, including the syndicated TV series, the newspaper cartoon panel, books, posters, and games.

Ripley first called his cartoon feature, originally involving sports feats, ''Champs and Chumps'', and it premiered on December 19, 1918, in ''[[The New York Globe]]''. Ripley began adding items unrelated to sports, and in October 1919, he changed the title to ''Believe It or Not''.  When the ''Globe'' folded in 1923, Ripley moved to the ''[[New York Evening Post]]''. In 1924, the panel began being syndicated by [[Associated Newspapers (U.S.)|Associated Newspapers]],&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Neal. ''A Curious Man: The Strange &amp; Brilliant Life of Robert "Believe It Or Not!" Ripley'' (Crown/Archetype, 2014), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; (formed as part of a cooperative that had included the ''Globe''). That same year, Ripley hired [[Norbert Pearlroth]] as his researcher, and Pearlroth spent the next 52 years of his life in the New York Public Library, working ten hours a day and six days a week in order to find unusual facts for Ripley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Norbert Pearlroth, 89, Researcher For 52 Years For 'Believe It Or Not' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/15/obituaries/norbert-pearlroth-89-researcher-for-52-years-for-believe-it-or-not.html |quote=Norbert Pearlroth, who combed hundreds of thousands of books in the New York Public Library over 52 years as sole researcher for ''Ripley's Believe It or Not,'' died of heart and kidney diseases Thursday at Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 89 years old and lived in Brooklyn. ... |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=April 15, 1983 |accessdate=2015-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers and researchers included Lester Byck. In 1930, Ripley moved to the ''[[New York American]]'' and was picked up by the [[King Features Syndicate]], being quickly syndicated on an international basis.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, ''A Curious Man'', pp. 163-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ripley died in 1949; those working on the syndicated newspaper panel after his death included [[Paul Frehm]] (1938–1978; he became the full-time artist in 1949), and his brother Walter Frehm (1948–1989); Walter worked part-time with his brother Paul and became a full-time Ripley artist from 1978 to 1989. Others who assisted included Clem Gretter (1941–1949), [[Bob Clarke (illustrator)|Bob Clarke]] (1943–1944), Joe Campbell (1946–1956), Art Sloggatt (1971–1975), Carl Dorese, and Stan Randall. Paul Frehm won the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for 1976 for his work on the series. Clarke later created parodies of ''Believe It or Not!'' for ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'', as did [[Wally Wood]] and [[Ernie Kovacs]], who also did a recurring satire called "Strangely Believe It!" on his TV programs. Other strips and books borrowed the Ripley design and format, such as Ralph Graczak's ''[[Our Own Oddities]]'', John Hix's ''[[Strange as it Seems]]'', and Gordon Johnston's ''[[It Happened in Canada]]''. The current artist is John Graziano and current researcher is Sabrina Sieck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/ripleysbelieveitornot |title=Ripley's Believe It or Not Comic Strip on |website=Gocomics.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the peak of its popularity, the syndicated feature was read daily by about 80 million readers, and during the first three weeks of May 1932 alone, Ripley received over two million pieces of fan mail. Dozens of paperback editions reprinting the newspaper panels have been published over the decades. Recent ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'' books containing new material have supplemented illustrations with photographs.

''[[Peanuts]]'' creator [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s first publication of artwork was published by Ripley. It was a cartoon claiming his dog was "a hunting dog who eats pins, tacks, screws, nails and razor blades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mendelson, Lee |title=Charlie Brown &amp; Charlie Schulz |year=1970 |publisher=The World Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schulz's dog Spike later became the model for ''Peanuts''' [[Snoopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles M.|last=Schulz|title=Around the world in 50 years: Charlie Brown's anniversary celebration|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|year=1994|page=11|isbn=978-0-8362-1766-7|authorlink=Charles M.

The people whose items are featured in such books as [[Ripley's Believe It or Not Annual|''Strikingly True'']], have what Edward Meyer, Vice President of Exhibits and Archives at Ripley Entertainment Inc. describes as an obsession. "Whatever it is they're after, it is so important to them that all the rest of the world can go on without them. They want to make something that makes them immortal, makes them a little different than you and me."&lt;ref name="Maynard Interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maynard's Spooky Action...An Interview with Edward Meyer from Ripley's Believe It or Not|url=http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-161-19-nov-2011|website=[[The Skeptic Zone]]|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the wide range of true and unbelievable art, sculpture, photographs, interactive devices, animal oddities, and recycled objects contained within the Ripley's collection, rarely considered are alien or witchcraft-type stories, which are, according to Meyers, difficult to prove. To be included in Ripley's Believe It or Not books, museums, or television shows, items must undergo scrutiny from Ripley's staff and be 100% authenticated.&lt;ref name="Maynard Interview"/&gt;

==Radio==
On April 14, 1930, Ripley brought "Believe It or Not" to [[radio]], the first of several series heard on [[NBC]], [[CBS]] and the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]].&lt;ref name="dunningota"&gt;Dunning, John. (1998). ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-507678-3}}. Pp. 76-78.&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted by [http://www.otr.com/ripley_on_radio.html Ripley On Radio], Ripley's broadcasts varied in length from 15 minutes to 30 minutes and aired in numerous different formats. When Ripley's 1930 debut on ''[[The Collier Hour]]'' brought a strong listener reaction, he was given a Monday night NBC series beginning April 14, 1930, followed by a 1931–32 series airing twice a week. After his strange stories were dramatized on NBC's ''Saturday Party'', Ripley was the host of ''[[The Baker's Broadcast]]'' from 1935 to 1937. He was scheduled in several different 1937–38 NBC timeslots and then took to the road with popular remote broadcasts. ''See America First with Bob Ripley'' (1938–40) on CBS expanded geographically into ''See All the Americas'', a 1942 program with Latin music. In 1944, he was heard five nights a week on Mutual in shows with an emphasis on [[World War II]]. ''Romance, Rhythm and Ripley'' aired on CBS in 1945, followed by ''Pages from Robert L. Ripley's Radio Scrapbook'' (1947–48).

Robert Ripley is known for several radio firsts. He was the first to broadcast nationwide on a radio network from mid-ocean, and he also participated in the first broadcast from [[Buenos Aires]] to [[New York City|New York]]. Assisted by a corps of translators, he was the first to broadcast to every nation in the world simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://matineeclassics.com/radio/1930/ripleys_believe_it_or_not/details/ |title=Old Time Radio Shows - Ripley's Believe It or Not!

As the years went on, the show became less about oddities and featured guest-driven entertainment such as comedy routines. Sponsors over the course of the program included [[Pall Mall (cigarette)|Pall Mall cigarettes]] and [[General Foods]]. The program ended its successful run in 1948 as Ripley prepared to convert the show format to [[television]].

===Film===
* Ripley hosted a series of two dozen ''Believe It or Not!'' theatrical short films between 1930 and 1932 for [[Warner Bros.]] [[Vitaphone]]. A 2-DVD release featuring 24 of these theatrical shorts is available in the United States beginning March 16, 2010 from [[Warner Home Video]], through their Warner Archive manufacture-on-demand program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wbshop.com/Ripleys-Believe-It-or-Not-193032/1000148019,default,pd.html |title=Ripley's Believe It or Not (1930–32) (2 DVD Set) |website=WBshop.com |publisher=[[Warner Bros.]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312070131/http://www.wbshop.com/Ripleys-Believe-It-or-Not-193032/1000148019,default,pd.html |archivedate=2010-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Directors on the shorts included [[Murray Roth]] (on the first five), [[Roy Mack (director)|Roy Mack]] and [[Alfred J.

*He also appeared in a Vitaphone musical short, ''Seasons Greetings'' (1931), with [[Ruth Etting]], [[Joe Penner]], [[Ted Husing]], [[Thelma White]], [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]], and others.
* Ripley's short films were parodied in a 1939 [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros.]] ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' [[cartoon]] titled ''Believe It or Else''. Released on June 25, 1939, directed by [[Tex Avery]] and written by [[Dave Monahan]], it featured a running gag in which [[Egghead (Looney Tunes)#Egghead|Egghead]] (a prototype [[Elmer Fudd]]) appeared to declare, "I don't believe it!"  On 5 November of the same year, another Avery documentary parody, ''Fresh Fish'', was released. Written by [[Jack Miller (writer)|Jack Miller]], this cartoon's running gag was a two-headed fish that kept swimming onto the screen to ask, "Pardon me, but can you tell me where I can find Mister Ripley?"
*[[20th Century Fox]] produced another [[film short]] titled '''Acquitted By The Sea''', released September 27, 1940, produced by [[Truman Talley]] and directed by [[Earl Allvine]]. This told an unusual story involving the ''[[Titanic]]''.

====Planned film====
On October 4, 2004, [[Paramount Pictures]] announced plans for a film that would chronicle the life of Robert Ripley. The film would be produced by [[James Jacks]] and his Alphaville Films company, associated with Paramount. [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]] were hired to write the script. Jacks explained, "It's about the exploits of Robert Ripley, one of the most popular newspaper cartoonists in the '30s and '40s, who was well known for going around the world and looking for oddities and getting into adventures while doing so. We want to make a series of movies that, if not quite the truth, are the adventures that should have happened." Jacks also said, "We want to turn it into an ''[[Indiana Jones]]'', a goofy version, as played by [[Johnny Depp]]. When they saw we had the writers from ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt|Larry Flynt]]'', they thought that we wanted to make the kinky version, but we saw a chance to do a [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]]-type movie with one of their characters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Linder|first=Brian|title=Paramount Telling Ripley Tale: Believe It or Not|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/10/04/paramount-telling-ripley-tale|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=IGN|date=2004-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 29, 2005, it was announced that [[Tim Burton]] would direct the film, with [[Jim Carrey]] starring as Robert Ripley. Filming was to begin in October 2006, for a 2007 release. Paramount hinted that the film, if successful, could be the start of a ''Ripley's'' film series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burton, Carrey May Believe|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/11/29/burton-carrey-may-believe|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=[[IGN]]|date=2005-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Jacks, [[Sean Daniel]] and [[Richard D. Zanuck]] were also to serve as producers for the film.&lt;ref name=Jan-2011/&gt; Zanuck spent six weeks in China to [[Location scouting|scout filming locations]] for the project.&lt;ref name=Borat/&gt;

On June 12, 2006, Paramount delayed the start of production on the film for at least a year because its projected budget went over the allowed $150 million. Carrey had waived his entire upfront salary to help keep costs low, but the project remained over budget. Burton and Carrey also wanted to have Alexander and Karaszewski make changes to the film's script to focus more on Ripley's ''Believe It or Not'' column. Carrey was adamant on avoiding what happened with his previous project, ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane (2005 film)|Fun with Dick and Jane]]'', which required reshoots and additional editing as a result of beginning production without a script. Filming had been scheduled to begin in China in November 2006. Although Paramount could have delayed production to spring 2007, the film was delayed further to allow Burton to film ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Michael|last2=Gardner|first2=Chris|title=Burton takes rain check on Par pic|url=https://variety.com/2006/film/features/burton-takes-rain-check-on-par-pic-1200337853/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burton, Carrey put 'Believe' on hold|url=https://variety.com/2006/more/news/burton-carrey-put-believe-on-hold-1200337840/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, Burton and Carrey approved writer [[Steve Oedekerk]] to rewrite the script. Oedekerk had worked with Carrey on several previous projects. Production was to begin in China in winter 2008, for a 2009 release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Michael|title=Oedekerk brings 'Ripley' back to life|url=https://variety.com/2006/film/features/oedekerk-brings-ripley-back-to-life-1117955948/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2006-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, Zanuck said he was no longer involved with the project, and that he was unaware that it was proceeding.&lt;ref name=Borat&gt;{{cite news|title=Borat's New-er Look|url=https://variety.com/2007/voices/columns/borats_newer_lo-1200571196/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2007-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oedekerk's draft was completed in June 2007, and was approved that month by Paramount, Burton, and Carrey. At that time, Carrey hoped to have production finished by summer 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Michael|title=Carrey lights up 'Phillip Morris'|url=https://variety.com/2007/film/markets-festivals/carrey-lights-up-phillip-morris-1117966194/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, it was reported that Paramount may be searching for a new director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burton Off Believe It or Not?

In October 2008, [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] pitched an idea for the film that was approved by Carrey and Paramount. Columbus' idea involved scrapping the previous China-based storyline entirely. Negotiations were underway that month to hire Columbus as director, with plans to hire a writer afterwards. Paramount planned to release the film in 2011, and hoped that it would be the start of a ''Ripley's'' film series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Michael|last2=Siegel|first2=Tatiana|title=Chris Columbus in talks for 'Ripley's': Paramount wants director for long-delayed film|url=https://variety.com/2008/film/features/chris-columbus-in-talks-for-ripley-s-1117994548/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, [[Eric Roth]] was hired to write the script, with Carrey still attached to star. Ken Atchity and Chi-Li Wong joined the project as producers, alongside Jacks and Daniel.&lt;ref name=Jan-2011&gt;{{cite news|last=McNary|first=Dave|title=Eric Roth takes on Ripley project: Jim Carrey remains attached to topline|url=https://variety.com/2011/film/news/eric-roth-takes-on-ripley-project-1118030181/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ripley's Believe It Or Not museum in Bangalore - Jim Ankan Deka photo.jpg|thumb|Ripley's Believe It Or Not museum at Innovative Film City in [[Bangalore]], [[India]].]]
When Ripley first displayed his collection to the public at the [[Century of Progress|Chicago World's Fair]] in 1933, it was labeled Ripley’s Odditorium and attracted over two million visitors during the run of the fair. (In an apparent promotional gimmick, beds were provided in the Odditorium for people who "fainted" daily.) That successful exhibition led to trailer shows across the country during the 1930s, and Ripley's collections were exhibited at many major fairs and expositions, including [[San Francisco]], [[San Diego]], [[Dallas]], and [[Cleveland]]. In [[New York City|New York]], the famed [[Times Square]] exhibit opened in 1939 on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. In 1950, a year after Ripley's death, the first permanent Odditorium opened in [[St. Augustine, Florida]].

{{as of|2010|12}}, there are 32 Ripley's ''Believe It or Not!'' Odditoriums around the world. Odditoriums, in the spirit of ''Believe It or Not!'', are often more than simple museums cluttered with curiosities. Some include theaters and arcades, such as the ones in [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee]] and [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin]]. Others are constructed oddly, such as the [[Orlando, Florida]] Odditorium which is built off-level as if the building is sinking.
Expected to open summer 2016 is the first Odditorium in the [[Netherlands]], at Dam square in [[Amsterdam]].

*'''St. Augustine''' – It is the oldest Ripley's Believe It or Not! and is located in the ''Castle Warden'', was purchased shortly after his death in 1949 and opened in 1950. Prior to becoming home to his vast collections from his many travels, "The Castle", as it is known, was once a hotel which played host to many famous guests, including Ripley himself and author/owner [[Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings]]. It was originally a [[Moorish Revival style]] mansion, built in 1887 by millionaire William Warden as a winter home. Its popularity and success led Ripley's associates to open new establishments throughout the United States and the world. Perhaps not surprisingly, it is also rumored to be haunted.

*'''Gatlinburg''' – The original museum, built in 1970, was destroyed by a massive fire caused by a faulty light fixture in a neighboring shop on July 14, 1992. It had to be completely rebuilt.

Artifacts salvaged from the blaze sport "I Survived The Fire" decals. It also has nearly twice the amount of exhibit space as the original. As with some other Ripley museums, it has a theme. It looks as if it has survived a major earthquake. Its interior and exterior feature cracks throughout, adhering to the theme. The Ripley's Company has since opened several other attractions in the area, including a "four-dimensional" theater, a state-of-the-art aquarium, a haunted factory, several arcades, two miniature golf courses, and a mirror maze all of which carry the Ripley's brand name and signature logo.

==Inaccuracies==
Authorities at the company insist that they thoroughly investigate everything and ensure their accuracy before they publish their research. This is emphasized on their [[television]] show, where they often say "If you see it on Ripley's, you can bet that it's real". However, two claims{{specify|date=December 2010}} appearing in their books have been dubbed "myths" by  [[MythBusters]].[Which ones?] One claim which had previously appeared in Ripley's books, concerning an accidental execution of 1,200 Turkish prisoners ordered under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], has had its accuracy called into question by [[Snopes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/misxlate/toux.asp |title=Ma Sacrée Toux! |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ripley's'' has reported the urban legend of [[Frank Tower]] - an individual who was supposed to have survived the sinkings of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], [[RMS Empress of Ireland|RMS ''Empress of Ireland'']], and [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']] - as being factual.  However, this story has been debunked by several sources.&lt;ref name= TitanicForDummies&gt;{{Citation | author = Spignes, Stephen J.  | title = The Titanic For Dummies | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jqO__ScTpnMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=9781118206508&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MjzxUqmrK6_lygGWqoCwBA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=william%20clark&amp;f=false | work = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. | date = 2012 | accessdate = 1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= EncyTintanica&gt;{{Citation | author = Molony, Senan | title = On the Trail of 'Lucky' Tower | url = http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/lucky-tower.html | work = Encyclopedia Titanica | date =  2004 | accessdate = 1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Society of Thailand ''' ({{lang-th|ราชบัณฑิตยสภา}}; {{RTGS|''Ratchabandittayasapha''}}, {{IPA-th|râːt.t͡ɕʰā.bān.dìt.tā.já.sā.pʰāː|pron}}), formerly known as the '''Royal Society of Siam''', is the [[national academy]] of [[Thailand]] in charge of academic works of the government.

The secretariat of the society is the Office of the Royal Society of Thailand ({{lang-th|สำนักงานราชบัณฑิตยสภา}}; {{RTGS|''Samnak-ngan Ratchabandittayasapha''}}), formerly known as the Royal Institute of Thailand ({{lang-th|ราชบัณฑิตยสถาน}}; {{RTGS|''Ratchabandittayasathan''}}). The office is an independent [[Ministry (government department)|department]] in the [[executive branch of Thailand]] and is not subject to any other agency.

The Royal Society of Siam was established on 19 April 1926 and was dissolved on 31 March 1933.&lt;ref name = "history"/&gt; The dissolved society was split into the Royal Institute of Thailand and the [[Fine Arts Department of Thailand]]. On 14 February 2015, the Royal Institute of Thailand was reorganised. Its administrative council became the Royal Society of Thailand, whilst the institute itself became the office of the society.&lt;ref name = "royinact2015"/&gt;

According to the present structure, the members of the Royal Society of Thailand are of three types: associate fellows, fellows, and honorary fellows. The associate fellows are experts selected and appointed by the society. The fellows are associate fellows selected by the society and appointed by the [[monarchy of Thailand|monarch]] upon advice of the prime minister. And the honorary fellows are prominent experts selected by the society and appointed in the same manner as the fellows.&lt;ref name = "royinact2015"/&gt;

The society is widely known for its official roles in the [[language planning|planning and regulation]] of the [[Thai language]], as well as its many publications, particularly the ''[[Royal Institute Dictionary]]'', the official and [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptive]] dictionary of the Thai language, and the [[Royal Thai General System of Transcription]], the official system for [[Romanization|romanising]] Thai words.

The budget allocated to the Royal Society for [[fiscal year|FY2018]] is 190.8 million [[Thai baht|baht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Thailand's Budget in Brief Fiscal Year 2018 |date=27 December 2017 |publisher=Bureau of the Budget (Thailand) |location=Bangkok |page=93 |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

On 19 April 1926, the Royal Society of Siam was established by King [[Prajadhipok]].&lt;ref name = "royinact2015"/&gt; The society was later dissolved on 31 March 1933 and its divisions were incorporated into two new agencies. The academic divisions became the Royal Institute of Thailand. The archaeological divisions became the Fine Arts Department of Thailand.&lt;ref name = "history"&gt;{{cite web | title=Prawat Khwam Pen Ma | script-title=th:ประวัติความเป็นมา | year=2007 | accessdate=2014-02-14 | location=Bangkok | publisher=Royal Institute of Thailand | language=Thai | url=http://www.royin.go.th/th/profile/index.php?SystemModuleKey=42&amp;SystemMenuID=1&amp;SystemMenuIDS=| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130706132320/http://www.royin.go.th/th/profile/index.php?SystemModuleKey=42&amp;SystemMenuID=1&amp;SystemMenuIDS=| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Act on Royal Institute, 1934'', which took effect on 24 April 1933, the institute was a [[legal person]] sponsored by the [[Government of Thailand|government]] and the [[Prime Minister of Thailand|prime minister]] was in charge of the institute. The act gave the institute three main duties: to conduct research in all fields and publish the outcomes for the common good of the nation, to exchange knowledge with foreign academic bodies, and to provide academic opinions to the government and public agencies. Under the act, the institute members were selected by the institute itself and were appointed by the monarch upon approval of the [[Cabinet of Thailand|cabinet]] and the [[House of Representatives (Thailand)|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Government of Thailand]] | date=1934-04-24 | accessdate=2015-02-14 | title=Phra Ratchabanyat Wa Duai Ratchabandittayasathan Phutthasakkarat Song Phan Si Roi Chet Sip Hok | script-title=th:พระราชบัญญัติว่าด้วยราชบัณฑิตยสถาน พุทธศักราช 2476 |trans-title=Act on Royal Institute, 1934 | url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2477/A/128.PDF | language=Thai | format=PDF | journal=[[Royal Thai Government Gazette]] | volume=51 | location=Bangkok | publisher=Cabinet Secretariat | pages=128–146 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 1942, the ''Royal Institute Act, 1942'', entered into force. The act changed the status of the institute from a legal person to a public organisation and authorised the prime minister to directly command the institute. The act also modified the method of selecting the institute members. The members were selected and nominated to the monarch by the prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Government of Thailand]] | date=1942-04-01 | accessdate=2015-02-14| title=Phra Ratchabanyat Ratchabandittayasathan Phutthasakkarat Song Phan Si Roi Paet Sip Ha | script-title=th:พระราชบัญญัติราชบัณฑิตยสถาน พุทธศักราช 2485 |trans-title=Royal Institute Act, 1942 | url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2485/A/022/789.PDF | language=Thai | format=PDF | journal=[[Royal Thai Government Gazette]] | volume=59 | issue=22 | location=Bangkok | publisher=Cabinet Secretariat | pages=789–798 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 December 1944, the ''Royal Institute Act (No. 2), 1944'', came into operation. It again modified the institute status and the member selection method. The institute became an independent department commanded by the prime minister and its members were selected by the institute itself and were appointed by the monarch upon advice of the prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Government of Thailand]] | date=1944-12-31 | accessdate=2015-02-14| title=Phra Ratchabanyat Ratchabandittayasathan (Chabab Thi Song) Phutthasakkarat Song Phan Si Roi Paet Sip Chet | script-title=th:พระราชบัญญัติราชบัณฑิตยสถาน (ฉะบับที่ 2) พุทธศักราช 2487 |trans-title=Royal Institute Act (No. 2), 1944 | url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2487/A/079/1215.PDF | language=Thai | format=PDF | journal=[[Royal Thai Government Gazette]] | volume=61 | issue=79 | location=Bangkok | publisher=Cabinet Secretariat | pages=1215–1220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 March 1952, the ''Administrative Reorganisation Act, 1952'', became operative. It changed the commander of the institute from the prime minister to the [[Ministry of Culture (Thailand)|culture minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Government of Thailand]] | date=1952-03-11 | accessdate=2015-02-14| title=Phra Ratchabanyat Prap Prung Krasuang Thabuang Krom Phutthasakkarat Song Phan Si Roi Kao Sip Ha | script-title=th:พระราชบัญญัติปรับปรุงกระทรวง ทบวง กรม พ.ศ. 2495 |trans-title=Administrative Reorganisation Act, 1952 | url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2495/A/016/313.PDF | language=Thai | format=PDF | journal=[[Royal Thai Government Gazette]] | volume=69 | issue=16 | location=Bangkok | publisher=Cabinet Secretariat | pages=313–327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 September 1958, the ''Administrative Reorganisation Act (No. 6), 1958'', became effective. It again changed the commander of the institute from the culture minister to the [[Ministry of Education (Thailand)|education minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Government of Thailand]] | date=1958-08-31 | accessdate=2015-02-14| title=Phra Ratchabanyat Prap Prung Krasuang Thabuang Krom (Chabab Thi Hok) Phutthasakkarat Song Phan Ha Roi Et | script-title=th:พระราชบัญญัติปรับปรุงกระทรวง ทบวง กรม (ฉบับที่ 6) พ.ศ. 2501 |trans-title=Administrative Reorganisation Act (No. 6), 1958 | url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2501/A/067/1.PDF | language=Thai | format=PDF | journal=[[Royal Thai Government Gazette]] | volume=75 | issue=67 (Special) | location=Bangkok | publisher=Cabinet Secretariat | pages=1–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 September 1972, Field Marshal [[Thanom Kittikachorn]], leader of the [[military junta|junta]] called ''Revolutionary Council'', issued the Revolutionary Council Announcement No. 216 which once again modified the status of the institute. According to the announcement, the institute changed its status from an independent department to a government department which was not subject to any other agency and was commanded by the education minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Government of Thailand]] | date=1958-08-31 | accessdate=2015-02-14| title=Prakat Khong Khana Patiwat Chabap Thi Song Roi Sip Hok Long Wan Thi Yi Sip Kao Kanyayon Song Phan Ha Roi Sip Ha | script-title=th:ประกาศของคณะปฏิวัติ ฉบับที่ 216 ลงวันที่ 29 กันยายน 2515 |trans-title=Revolutionary Council Announcement No. 216 dated 29 September 1972 | url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2515/A/145/1.PDF | language=Thai | format=PDF | journal=[[Royal Thai Government Gazette]] | volume=89 | issue=145 (Special) | location=Bangkok | publisher=Cabinet Secretariat | pages=1–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 2001, the ''Royal Institute Act, 2001'', entered into operation. Under the act, the institute was a government department which was not subject to any other agency. The act also improved the structure of the institute and increased its missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Government of Thailand]] | date=2001-11-12 | accessdate=2015-02-14 | title=Phra Ratchabanyat Ratchabandittayasapha Phutthasakkarat Song Phan Ha Roi Si Sip Si | script-title=th:พระราชบัญญัติราชบัณฑิตยสถาน พ.ศ. 2544 |trans-title=Royal Institute Act, 2001 | url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/00026777.PDF | language=Thai | format=PDF | journal=[[Royal Thai Government Gazette]] | volume=118 | issue=104A | location=Bangkok | publisher=Cabinet Secretariat | pages=1–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February 2015, the ''Royal Society Act, 2015'', came into force and reorganised the institute. Under the act, the administrative council of the institute, then known as Council of Fellows (สภาราชบัณฑิต), became the Royal Society, and the institute became the secretariat of the society, known as the Office of the Royal Society. The act granted many new powers to the office, including the powers to manage its own budgets, to provide advanced training in all [[#Academies|fields of the society]], and to confer certificates upon the trainees. A welfare fund for the society members was also established by the act.&lt;ref name = "royinact2015"&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Government of Thailand]] | date=2015-02-13 | accessdate=2015-02-14 | title=Phra Ratchabanyat Ratchabandittayasapha Phutthasakkarat Song Phan Ha Roi Ha Sip Paet | script-title=th:พระราชบัญญัติราชบัณฑิตยสภา พ.ศ. 2558 |trans-title=Royal Society Act, 2015 | url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2558/A/010/1.PDF | language=Thai | format=PDF | journal=[[Royal Thai Government Gazette]] | volume=132 | issue=10A | location=Bangkok | publisher=Cabinet Secretariat | pages=1–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the fellows objected to renaming the institute because no public hearing on the matter was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://m.posttoday.com/articlestory/326914|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150419093321/http://m.posttoday.com/articlestory/326914|archivedate = 2015-04-19|title = Yuen sonocho khan plian chue ratchabandittayasathan|date = 2014-10-28|access-date = 2015-04-16|newspaper = Post Today|location = Bangkok|language = Thai|script-title = ยื่น สนช. ค้านเปลี่ยนชื่อ "ราชบัณฑิตยสถาน"|trans-title = Objection to renaming of the Royal Institute has been filed with the NLA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==

[[Image:Royal Institute Entrance.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Entrance to the former building of the society .]]
[[Image:Royal Institute meeting room.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A meeting room of the society  in its former building, following a meeting of the Dictionary Revision Committee.]]

On 21 August 2006, the society  relocated to offices at Sanam Suea Pa, near the [[Royal Plaza (Thailand)|Royal Plaza]] in Bangkok. Previously, the institute was located in the [[Grand Palace]], [[Bangkok]].

==Administration==
For administrative purposes, the society has four divisions:
:Secretariat General
:Moral and Political Sciences Division
:Science Division
:Arts Division

The society's website states that each division has a staff of civil servants and clerical employees who perform both business and academic functions facilitating the works of fellows and associate fellows as well as conducting and promoting various academic activities.

==Fellows==
Scholars from the academic community of Thailand can apply for membership in the society. Acceptance is based on an applicant's contributions to his field and his published works. The levels of membership in the institute are:
# Honorary fellows (ราชบัณฑิตกิตติมศักดิ์)
# Fellows (ราชบัณฑิต)
# Associate fellows (ภาคีสมาชิก)

Of these, only the title of associate fellow can be applied for. Fellows are appointed by the monarch as senior experts in the society within their field, chosen from among the existing associate fellows. Honorary fellows are likewise appointed by the monarch and are chosen from among scholars who are not already fellows of the society. These three groups can be collectively referred to as the members of the society.

==Academies==
Fellows of the society are divided into three academies. Each academy is subdivided into branches, and each branch includes several specific fields, totalling 137 different academic disciplines.

== Seal ==

The official seal of the society is a shining sword behind an open book bearing a [[Pali]] word, ''paṇḍito'' ("scholars"). A crown floats upon the sword and a ribbon bearing the name of the society is below the book.&lt;ref name="seal"&gt;{{cite web | author=Royal Institute of Thailand | year=2007 | accessdate=2015-02-16 | title=Khrueang mai ratchakan khong Ratchabandittayasathan | script-title=th:เครื่องหมายราชการของราชบัณฑิตยสถาน |trans-title=Official symbol of the Royal Institute | language=Thai | location=Bangkok | publisher=Royal Institute of Thailand | url=http://www.royin.go.th/th/profile/index.php?SystemModuleKey=77&amp;SystemMenuID=1&amp;SystemMenuIDS= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150216104347/http://www.royin.go.th/th/profile/index.php?SystemModuleKey=77&amp;SystemMenuID=1&amp;SystemMenuIDS= | archivedate=2015-02-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sword and the book is based upon a saying, "wisdom is on a par with weapon" (ปัญญาประดุจดังอาวุธ). The light of the sword represents the light of wisdom. The crown represents the monarch.&lt;ref name = "seal"/&gt;

===''Royal Institute Dictionary''===

{{main|Royal Institute Dictionary}}

Perhaps the most well-known work of the society is the [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptive]] ''Royal Institute Dictionary'' (พจนานุกรม ฉบับราชบัณฑิตยสถาน, in English often abbreviated RID).

The society has published four fully revised editions of the dictionary, and many intermittent reprintings with minor revisions. Each of the major revisions is associated with a significant year in Thai history, although in the case of the 1999 and 2011 editions, the actual publication date is a later year.

===Spelling guidelines===
The Royal Society publishes guidelines for spelling loanwords in Thai.

In 2012, a proposed change brought about concerns and criticism among the public, when Professor [[Kanchana Naksakul]], an RIT senior fellow, proposed the new spellings of Thai words borrowed from English.&lt;ref name = "thenation"&gt;{{cite web | title = Royal Institute announces new spellings of 176 words | url = http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/Royal-Institute-announces-new-spellings-of-176-wor-30191464.html | publisher = The Nation | date = October 1, 2012 | accessdate=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "prachachat a"&gt;{{cite web | script-title=th:เปิด 176 คำทับศัพท์ภาษาอังกฤษ เตรียมแก้ให้ตรงเสียง เห็นแล้วจะอึ้ง!! |trans-title=See new spellings of 176 words borrowed from English and you'll get voiceless!! | url = http://www.prachachat.net/news_detail.php?newsid=1348993928&amp;grpid=09&amp;catid=12&amp;subcatid=1207 | publisher = Prachachat | date = September 30, 2012 | accessdate=October 1, 2012 | language = Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thai words borrowed from English are spelled without [[Thai language#Tones|tone marks]], although they are pronounced [[Tone (linguistics)|tonally]]. The new spellings would add the marks to them.&lt;ref name = "thenation"/&gt;

Kanchana said that the new spellings were identified by the survey of some 300 people in the language circles who were of the same opinion that the spellings would better reflect how the words are pronounced in Thai and would assist the foreigners in learning Thai language.&lt;ref name = "thenation"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "prachachat a"/&gt;

The proposal was supported by the Ministry of Education and by many higher education lecturers, including those from [[Chulalongkorn University]].&lt;ref name = "prachachat b"&gt;{{cite web | script-title=th:'ครูลิลลี่' ห่วงคนใช้สับสน 'ศัพท์ลูกครึ่ง' 176 คำศัพท์จากราชบัณฑิต |trans-title=Kru Lilly's concern: users will get confused in using 176 borrowed words respelled by the Royal Institute | url = http://www.prachachat.net/news_detail.php?newsid=1349072633&amp;grpid=03&amp;catid=12&amp;subcatid=1205 | publisher = Prachachat | date = October 1, 2012 | accessdate=October 1, 2012 | language = Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it met with heavy objections from secondary education teachers and the general public.&lt;ref name = "prachachat b"/&gt; Those objecting based their opinions on the fact that the survey was conducted on a small group of people and that English is not a tonal language and, therefore, Thai words borrowed from it need not to contain tone marks unless necessary.&lt;ref name = "prachachat b"/&gt; Some critics, including [[Kitmanoch Rojanasupya]] or Kru Lilly, a renowned Thai language teacher, expressed their concern that the proposal would turn Thai language system into turmoil. They also remarked that it is foreign learners who should adapt to Thai language structure, not to adjust the latter to the former.&lt;ref name = "prachachat b"/&gt;

On 1 October 2012, RIT secretary general Kanokwalee Chuchaiya declared that the proposal was merely a proposal and was pending internal proceedings scheduled to be concluded in December of that year. She confirmed that public hearings would be held on the new spellings, and that the 2011 dictionary does not contain these spellings, as its printing had already been completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | script-title=th:เลขาราชบัณฑิตฯ ยันยังไม่มีการแก้คำทับศัพท์ในพจนานุกรม พ.ศ. 2554 |trans-title=Royal Institute Secretary General confirmed: no new spellings in RID 2011 | url = http://www.prachachat.net/news_detail.php?newsid=1349101174&amp;grpid=03&amp;catid=00 | publisher = Prachachat | date = October 1, 2012 | accessdate=October 1, 2012 | language = Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation also prompted RIT president, Professor Panya Borisut, to hold a rare [[News conference|press conference]] on the morning of 3 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.royin.go.th/upload/246/FileUpload/2255_6368.pdf | script-title = th:งานแถลงข่าวการจัดพิมพ์พจนานุกรม พ.ศ. ๒๕๕๔ และตอบข้อสงสัยกรณีการเขียนคำยืมจากภาษาอังกฤษที่มีอยู่ในพจนานุกรม | trans-title = Press Conference on Publication of Royal Institute Dictionary 2011 and Answering Questions on Words Borrowed from English to be respelled in the Dictionary | publisher = Royal Institute of Thailand | date = April 3, 2012 | format = pdf | language = Thai | accessdate = October 10, 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140407084811/http://www.royin.go.th/upload/246/FileUpload/2255_6368.pdf | archivedate = April 7, 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 December 2012, the RIT senate voted against the proposal, putting an end to it as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prachachat.net/news_detail.php?newsid=1355722270&amp;grpid=03&amp;catid=00 | script-title=th:ราชบัณฑิตล้มคำยืมจากภาษาอังกฤษ หลังผลไม่เห็นด้วย 178 เสียง |trans-title=178 of Royal Institute Senators voted against the proposal to respell the words borrowed from English | publisher = Prachachat Online | date = December 17, 2012 | accessdate = December 17, 2012 | language = Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Thai General System of Transcription===

{{main|Royal Thai General System of Transcription}}

The society publishes the Royal Thai General System of Transcription&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140323134709/http://www.royin.go.th/upload/246/FileUpload/416_2157.pdf Royal Thai General System of Transcription (RTGS)]&lt;/ref&gt; or RTGS, the official way of transcribing Thai into the Latin alphabet.

The '''Schmerenbeck Educational Centre for Gifted and Talented Children''', an organisation based at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], promoted, encouraged and fostered the education of gifted children within South Africa.  The centre was originally housed on campus in portable prefabricated buildings before it moved to a house in the Johannesburg suburb of [[Parktown]] opposite the University of the Witwatersrand's Education Department.

== History ==

===Formation of the Association for the Education of Gifted Children in South Africa 1970-1975===

In 1970, lecturers in the Mathematics and Computer Departments of the University of the Witwatersrand were approached by parents of gifted children to provide challenging out-of-school activities.  Thereafter, a group of lecturers established a steering committee chaired by Dr Ferrandi,  and The Association for the Education of Gifted Children in South Africa (A.E.G.C.) was formed on 11 September 1971.  Professor S.P. Jackson, deputy vice-chancellor and dean of the Faculty of Education, became the chairman.  He held this position until 1979.

In 1971, over 150 school principals were approached to nominate pupils, who were then tested on individual intelligence tests by the Department of Psychology.  60 children were tested and 20 selected with scores over 140&amp;ndash;160. Courses were offered in computers, mathematics, astronomy, television and chess to these 60 children, with higher level courses for the 20 highly gifted.

In 1973 Jackson visited the United Kingdom to research best practices and ensure that the programmes offered were on international lines.

In 1975 two members of the executive attended the First World Conference for Gifted and Talented Children in London.

====Constitution====
According to the constitution, adopted on 18 November 1975, the objective was to promote, encourage and foster the education of gifted children within South Africa through liaison, information and educational programmes for pupils, parents and teachers.

===Creation of the Schmerenbeck Educational Centre in terms of the Schmerenbeck bequest 1975-1979===

In 1973, Ami Schmerenbeck of Windhoek showed interest in the education of gifted children and the work of the A.E.G.C.  After her death in April 1975, her sister, Suzanne Sittman, trustee of the Schmerenbeck estate, negotiated with Professor Bozzoli regarding the establishment of the "Ami and Kurt Schmerenbeck Fund".  As the constitution of the A.E.G.C. was a voluntary association and not a corporate body, the funds were given to the university.  The terms of the bequest stipulated that the money be used for the practical provision of educational courses for gifted students and not for research purposes.  Professor Kahn, deputy vice-chancellor, became the university representative on the Executive of the A.E.G.C. In February 1978, a meeting was held with Prof Jackson and heads of Education and Psychology, the deputy vice-chancellor, and it was agreed that a director be appointed who would have an affiliation to a university department.  In 1979 the first director, Beverly Kahn, was appointed.

It was agreed that a portion of the bequest be used to establish a centre for the activities of the A.E.G.C. and a prefab Hut A on campus was renovated, equipped and developed to suit the needs of the activities.  Activities began in the building in January 1977 and on 26 February 1977 Sittman formally opened the "Schmerenbeck Educational Centre".&lt;ref&gt;

===Incorporation of the Schmerenbeck Centre into the University of the Witwatersrand 1980-1984===

At a meeting of the A.E.G.C. 19 November 1980, under the chairmanship of Dr J.F. van Zyl, a resolution was passed that the university take over the Schmerenbeck Educational Centre (SEC) and that the A.E.G.C. be dissolved according to the constitution.  The running of the SEC would fall under a Council Board of Control and an Advisory Committee.  On 11 December 1980 the agreement with the university was signed.

===Model for an effective centre===

In 1980 Dr Gillian Eriksson was appointed director and an administrative secretary was appointed. In 1981, due to increased numbers, a position of assistant to the director was created and receptionists were appointed.  In 1991 Eva Biebuyck became the director.  A clinical psychologist was appointed to do the assessments and placements.

As a result of local and international visits and research, the director presented a model for an effective operational education centre in a report in August 1981 (Eriksson, 1981). Objectives included: 
* The actualization of intellectual, social, emotional and physical potential in children who have high abilities in diverse areas including the disadvantaged and disabled;
* To provide diagnostic psycho-educational assessment which is multifaceted, individualized and appropriate for the child;
* To create a differential educational programme relevant to the needs of the children through acceleration, enrichment, self-study, skill development;
* To communicate the needs of high ability children, to advise schools and teachers on programmes and provide in-service training
* To encourage research in liaison with other University departments

The structure of the Centre would include four units:
* Services (educational programming)
* Communications (publications, liaison and information)
* Research and training for certification.
* Psycho-educational assessment.

This model formed the basis of the development of the SEC which operated a comprehensive system, not only providing services for a large group of gifted children but also forming the basis of advocacy for gifted education throughout South Africa and a catalyst for change.  Teachers at the SEC were given in-service training and a publication was developed to guide the development of their courses and provide a range of appropriate strategies.  The director taught courses in the Education Department and provided a range of workshops for parents and teachers on gifted education.  Over this period it developed publications such as the journal ''Metamind'' in 1984 and a collection of student work, the ''Schmerenbeck Scrapbook'', edited by students.

The director took an active role in advocating for gifted children internationally, attending the world conferences and was elected a national delegate to the World Council for Gifted and Talented Children.[https://world-gifted.org]

===Move to 3 Trematon Place, Parktown 1985-1992===

The SEC occupied a historical building at 3 Trematon Place from 1985.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Trematon House started as a modest home for E Holmes in 1902. In 1910 the house was redeveloped as a boarding house with dormitories and bedrooms, a dining hall, kitchen and communal bathroom and toilets for the Parktown Preparatory School PTPS. The style is late Edwardian and Geoffrey E Pearse was the architect. Pearse was appointed the first Professor of Architecture at Wits in 1921 and had the distinction of being the first Professor of Architecture in South Africa. The Foundation stone was laid by Sir Lionel Phillips in 1913 and the project was completed in 1914. The PTPS building was itself demolished to make way for EOH. Wits acquired the building in 1963 and it served as the home of the Institute for Adult Education" (Wits News room), then the Schmerenbeck Centre until 1992.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was converted into a university residence and in 2010 Trematon House houses international students.[https://web.archive.org/web/20090419143933/http://web.wits.ac.za/NewsRoom/NewsItems/WBS.htm]

===Differentiation of the programme===

The SEC operated a comprehensive range of programmes with over 70 teachers and up to 1431 students in classes (largest number from 1986).   As a result of the large numbers, the general classes were differentiated to serve specific types and ages of gifted children.

====Levels of programming====
* MICROCAPES: Enrichment programme for preschool gifted children (from 1985).  Created in terms of the concentration span, developmental stages, activity patterns of preschool and grade children who show high potential.
* PROJECTS PLUS for primary (elementary) gifted children (from 1981) including core courses, enrichment courses, acceleration courses, excursion courses, research.  Designed to challenge and enrich gifted children from standard 1 to 5 through stimulating classes that generate a love of learning.
* CREATIVE ARTS Programme for Talented Children (from 1984) standard 1&amp;ndash;10, that included core courses, arts workshops, and integrated arts workshops.
* YOUTH UNIVERSITY: Programme for high school students (from 1988) that assisted them with the transition to university.
* Outreach programmes to local communities.

===Dissolution of the Schmerenbeck Educational Centre 1992-1995===

From 1986, numbers began to drop due largely to the programmes created by the Transvaal Education Department which were initiated from 1982 and implemented in centres in 1986. Due to changes within the university in relation to the structure and financing of the SEC, the university decided to close the SEC in 1992.

The Advisory Committee and director, Eva Biebuyck, created a private entity to continue the work of the SEC and established premises in a private house in Oxford Road, Rosebank which continued to operate until 1995, when it was closed.

The ''Studienstiftung'' is funded by the federal government of Germany, the German federal states and local authorities, a large number of foundations and businesses as well as numerous private donors.&lt;ref&gt;yearly report [https://www.studienstiftung.de/publikationen/bericht/]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the ''Studienstiftung's'' budget was over €103 million. Since its foundation, it has supported over 65,000 students and doctoral candidates; it currently has over 60,000 alumni worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studienstiftung.de/daten.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924111111/http://www.studienstiftung.de/daten.html |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The selection process is extremely rigorous and only those students who show outstanding academic and personal promise are chosen. The Studienstiftung awards scholarships to fewer than 0.5% of German students.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/facts-and-figures/&lt;/ref&gt;  It is often referred to as Germany's "secret elite university".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.welt.de/wams_print/article1896470/Elite-sein-wird-einfacher.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially founded in Dresden in 1925 as a department of the [[:de:Deutsche Studentenschaft|Deutsche Studentenschaft]], an amalgamation of German student committees, the Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes was dissolved in 1934 under [[:de:Zeit des Nationalsozialismus|National Socialism]] and replaced by the "Reichsförderung", a department of the newly founded [[:de:Studentenwerk|Reichsstudentenwerk]]. The Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes was newly formed as a registered association in [[:de:Köln|Cologne]] in 1948. As well as offering scholarship programmes on a national level, since 2005 the Studienstiftung has also run the Max Weber Programme, which supports exceptionally talented students within the framework of the Bavarian Elite Support Act (BayEFG).

==Admission==

The German Academic Scholarship Foundation supports exceptionally talented students and doctoral candidates selected in accordance with its mission statement, which is based upon the principles of achievement, initiative and responsibility. Scholars are admitted through various channels:
# '''Nomination by a school''': The principal of a high school or school with an upper secondary level can nominate one in 50 senior students for admission to the Studienstiftung. This student must excel both academically and in terms of social commitment. Nominated students attend a three-day selection seminar where their eligibility for funding is assessed in individual interviews and group discussions. 23.8% of students nominated in 2015 were offered admission to the Studienstiftung. There is no set admissions quota for the number of students admitted each year.
# '''Nomination by professors''': Students at universities and universities of applied science can be nominated directly by university teachers. Again, candidates attend a selection seminar. In 2015, 48.3% of students nominated by their professors were offered admission to the Studienstiftung.
# '''Nomination by an examination board''': Just as students can be nominated by schools, one in every 50 students in the second academic year in his/her respective study programme can be nominated by universities and universities of applied science. The nomination must be supported by a professor. The selection seminar is organised along the same lines as the selection seminar for students nominated by schools. In this case, however, the candidate's proven academic achievements at university also carry weight. In 2015, 28.8% of nominees were offered admission.
# '''Winners of a national or federal competition or nomination by select cooperation partners''': Winners of or participants in various competitions on a national, federal or international level (e.g. [[:de:Bundeswettbewerb Informatik|Bundeswettbewerb Informatik]], [[:de:Bundeswettbewerb Mathematik|Bundeswettbewerb Mathematik]], [[:de:Bundeswettbewerb Fremdsprachen|Bundeswettbewerb Fremdsprachen]], [[:de:Jugend forscht|Jugend forscht]], [[:de:Jugend debattiert|Jugend debattiert]], [[:de:Internationale Mathematik-Olympiade|Internationale Mathematik-Olympiade]], [[:de:Internationale Physikolympiade|Internationale Physik-Olympiade]], [[:de:Humanismus heute|Altsprachenwettbewerb des Landes Baden-Württemberg]]) may be offered admission to the Studienstiftung. Select cooperation partners (e.g. START-Stiftung) may also nominate potential sponsorship candidates.
# Since February 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.studienstiftung.de/aktuelles.html?&amp;user_press%5Buid%5D=153&amp;cHash=54b3bca333|title=Aktuelles - Neuer Auswahltest der Studienstiftung|website=www.studienstiftung.de|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; candidates can also put themselves forward for a scholarship. First and second-semester students can sign up for the Studienstiftung assessment test in January/February/March&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.studienstiftung.de/studienfoerderung/selbstbewerbung/?view%5Bdetail%5D=1&amp;cHash=dc5048e0d8d22c35874e4b9b7b6ffb4d|title=Selbstbewerbung Test|website=www.studienstiftung.de|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; each year. The test is held at test centres throughout Germany. The applicants with the best results are invited to attend the selection seminar. While the assessment test determines applicants' cognitive abilities, the selection seminar focuses on motivation, extracurricular interests, social commitment and social skills, which are assessed in personal interviews and group discussions.
# '''Nomination by alumni''': Studienstiftung alumni may also nominate students who they consider appropriate, having taught them personally in school or university courses.
# Support of musicians and artists: After an internal pre-selection procedure, universities can nominate students of the fine arts, music and the performing arts for participation in a Studienstiftung selection seminar.
# '''Doctoral sponsorship''': Highly qualified and socially committed PhD students may, together with their supervisors, submit an application for support for their doctoral studies.
If admission occurs before the end of the fourth semester, sponsorship is usually granted until the end of the sixth semester. An extension of the scholarship beyond the sixth semester usually depends on academic performance in the first four semesters. In borderline cases, aspects other than academic achievements – such as exceptional social engagement or particular personal circumstances – may positively influence the decision to approve further funding. After an application has been approved, funding is awarded from the 6th semester until studies are completed (for example, until the master's degree or state examinations have been completed). In 2014, 91% of requests for further funding were approved.

==Support==

The Studienstiftung supports scholars both financially and academically.

=== Financial support ===

Financial support includes a study expense allowance (€300 month) and a need-based basic scholarship, which is calculated according to the BAföG ([[Bundesausbildungsförderungsgesetz|Federal Training Assistance Act]]) and can currently be up to 825 € per month. PhD students receive a monthly award of €1,250. Additional funds are provided for students and PhD students with children. Financial support is regulated by the guidelines of the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).
Visits abroad are also supported by grants or overseas allowances and the partial payment of tuition fees. Under the terms of No. 11 [[:de:Einkommensteuergesetz|Einkommensteuergesetz]] (EStG – German Income Tax Law) scholarship payments are tax-free.

=== Academic support ===

The Studienstiftung's academic support includes [[:de:Sommerakademie|summer academies]], research groups, [[language courses]], [[workshop]]s and supervision by local [[tutor]]s, who carry out this task for the Studienstiftung on a voluntary basis. Scholars are required to submit a report on their studies and other activities every semester during the first semesters (usually until the end of the fourth semester), and once a year thereafter. Grant holders can also apply for funding in order to organise their own conferences and other events.

=== Internal scholarship programmes ===

In addition to its regular funding schemes, the Studienstiftung offers internal scholarship programmes for selected scholars and alumni. Examples include the KAUST-Studienstiftung programme, a joint partnership between [[KAUST]] and the Studienstiftung under the patronage of the [[German Federal Foreign Office]] which allows scholars from the [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] disciplines to join KAUST for research internships or to enroll in Master or PhD programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KAUST-Programm der Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes - Forschung, Sprache und Kultur im Königreich Saudi-Arabien|periodical=|publisher=Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes|url=http://www.studienstiftung-ksa.de/|format=|accessdate=2018-06-03|last=|date=2017-02-26|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the musical field, for example, in cooperation with the [[Beethoven House]] residence scholarships are awarded for young composers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Förderung für Studierende - Komponistenresidenz|periodical=|publisher=Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes|url=https://www.studienstiftung.de/studienfoerderung/musikhochschulen/komponistenresidenz/|format=|accessdate=2018-06-03|last=|date=2018-06-03|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Open scholarship programmes ===

Moreover, the Studienstiftung offers open scholarship programmes which are run and financed in cooperation with other organisations. The best known programmes are the [[:de:McCloy Academic Scholarship Program|McCloy Academic Scholarship Program]], the [[:de:ERP-Stipendienprogramm|ERP-Stipendienprogramm]] and the [[:de:Carlo-Schmid-Programm|Carlo-Schmid-Programm]].&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.studienstiftung.de/stipendienprogramme.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[5]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; Participation in these scholarship programmes does not require previous funding by the Studienstiftung.

The '''Hands for Music Foundation''', otherwise known as Hands for Music, is a registered [[501(c)(3)|501(c)(3) nonprofit organization]] whose primary
purpose is to bring [[Music instruction|musical instruction]] to children and teenagers suffering from [[mental disabilities]] and [[mental illnesses]]. It is both an in-school and after school program, in which high school music teachers, as well as peer students, teach students afflicted with mental illnesses a variety of different instruments.This charity has been able to raise funds to buy instruments in over 8 high schools in [[Connecticut]]. It has been successful in providing musical education for a variety of mental afflictions, including [[Down syndrome|Down Syndrome]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], and [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)]].

== History ==

Student founder Jay Vankawala began constructing the Hands for Music Foundation in early 2013 while teaching a fellow student with [[Down Syndrome]]. "Min-Jae" needed peer interaction to foster social behavior, and Vankawala was selected to teach him [[piano]]. As he moved to high school, Vankawala wanted to expand his teaching to more students and to more schools. He founded the foundation initially as just Hands for Music, and extended the name as well as its reach under the guidance of music teacher Jennifer Crooks. However, many schools he visited lacked the facilities in order to make the program a success, and as such, it was officially registered as a [[501(c)(3)]] charity in order to raise money for these instruments.

== Philosophy ==
The Hands for Music Foundation's philosophy is similar to that of music instructional program [[Simply Music]], in that it believes that "any child can learn music." However, Hands for Music extends that claim to include children with [[mental disabilities]]. It believes that musicality is inherent within all humans, and as such, should be available to these students trying to assimilate into the public school system. "A child's journey through Hands for Music is less of a musical journey and more of a social one," Vankawala says.&lt;ref&gt;http://handsformusic.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt; He and his team have structured this charity for this reason.

== Process ==
Volunteer students will raise money by performing and holding recitals within school. This money, along with donations from community donors, will be spent exclusively by schools to purchase musical instruments for mentally struggling students. These volunteers will also teach these students, and the pupils will hold recitals, continuing the cycle. In the process, it is hoped that teachers and students will become lifelong friends and increase one's sense of belonging in a community. As of March 2016, the Hands for Music Foundation has raised over $4,000 over the course of 2 years to fund projects in 6 high schools in southern Connecticut.{{fact|date=May 2018}}
