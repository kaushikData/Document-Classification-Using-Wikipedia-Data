{{Campaignbox Suppression of the Slave Trade}}
'''Abolitionism''' (or the '''abolitionist movement''') is the movement to end [[slavery]]. This term can be used formally or informally. In [[Western Europe]] and the [[Americas]], abolitionism is a historical movement in effort to end the African and Indian [[slave trade]] and set slaves free. King Charles I of Spain, usually known as [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], was following the example of [[Louis X of France]] who abolished slavery within the [[Kingdom of France]] in 1315. He passed [[New Laws|a law which would have abolished colonial slavery]] in 1542, although this law was not passed in the largest colonial states, and was not enforced. In the late 17th century, the [[Roman Catholic Church]], taking up a plea by [[Lourenço da Silva de Mendouça]], officially condemned the slave trade, which was affirmed vehemently by [[Pope Gregory XVI]] in 1839. The abolitionist movement only started in the late 18th century, however, when English and American [[Quakers]] began to question the morality of slavery. [[James Oglethorpe]] was among the first to articulate the Enlightenment case against slavery, banning it in the [[Province of Georgia]] on humanitarian grounds, and arguing against it in Parliament, and eventually encouraging his friends [[Granville Sharp]] and [[Hannah More]] to vigorously pursue the cause. Soon after his death in 1785, Sharp and More united with [[William Wilberforce]] and others in forming the [[Clapham Sect]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Thomas, ''The Oglethorpe Plan'', 201–06.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Somersett Case]] in 1772, in which a fugitive slave was freed in England with the judgement that slavery did not exist under English [[common law]] and was thus prohibited in England, helped launch the British movement to abolish slavery. Though anti-slavery sentiments were widespread by the late 18th century, the colonies and emerging nations that used slave labour continued to do so: [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], [[French colonial empire|French]], [[British Empire|English]], [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] territories in the [[West Indies]]; [[South America]]; and the [[Southern United States]]. After the [[American Revolution]] established the [[United States]], northern states, beginning with [[Pennsylvania]] in 1780, passed legislation during the next two decades abolishing slavery, sometimes by gradual emancipation. [[Massachusetts]] ratified a [[Massachusetts Constitution|constitution]] that declared all men equal; [[freedom suits]] challenging slavery based on this principle brought an end to slavery in the state. [[Vermont]], which existed as an unrecognized state from 1777 to 1791, [[slavery in Vermont|abolished adult slavery in 1777]]. In other states, such as [[Virginia]], similar declarations of rights were interpreted by the courts as not applicable to Africans and African Americans. During the following decades, the abolitionist movement grew in northern states, and Congress regulated the expansion of slavery in new states admitted to the union.

[[France]] abolished slavery within the French Kingdom (continental France) in 1315. In May 1787 the [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] was formed in London to end the British slave trade. [[French Revolution|Revolutionary France]] abolished slavery in France's colonies in 1794, although it was restored by [[Napoleon]] with the [[Law of 20 May 1802]] as part of a program to ensure French sovereignty over its colonies. [[Haiti]] formally declared independence from France in 1804 and brought an end to slavery in its territory. The northern states in the U.S. all abolished slavery by 1804. [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]] and the United States outlawed the [[Atlantic slave trade|international slave trade]] in 1807, after which Britain led efforts to [[Blockade of Africa|block slave ships]]. Britain abolished slavery throughout the [[British Empire]] with the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]], the [[French colonial empire|French colonies]] re-abolished it in 1848 and the U.S. abolished slavery in 1865 with the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]].

In [[Eastern Europe]], groups organized to abolish the enslavement of the [[Romani people|Roma]] in [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]]; and to emancipate the [[serfs]] in Russia ([[Emancipation reform of 1861]]). It was declared illegal in 1948 under the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. The last country to abolish legal slavery was [[Mauritania]], where it was officially abolished by a presidential decree in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2012/03/world/mauritania.slaverys.last.stronghold/index.html Slavery's last stronghold]", CNN. March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, child and adult slavery and [[Unfree labour|forced labour]] are illegal in most countries, as well as being against [[international law]], but a high rate of [[human trafficking]] for labour and for sexual bondage [[Contemporary slavery|continues]] to affect tens of millions of adults and children.

==France==

===Abolition in continental France (1315)===
In 1315, [[Louis X of France|Louis X]], king of France, published a decree proclaiming that "France signifies freedom" and that any slave setting foot on the French ground should be freed. This prompted subsequent governments to circumscribe slavery in the [[French colonial Empire|overseas colonies]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher L. Miller, [https://books.google.com/books?id=480BBURkreYC&amp;pg=PA122 ''The French Atlantic Triangle: literature and culture of the slave trade]'', Duke University Press, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cases of African slaves freed by setting foot on the French soil were recorded such as this example of a [[Normandy|Norman]] slave merchant who tried to sell slaves in [[Bordeaux]] in 1571. He was arrested and his slaves were freed according to a declaration of the [[Parlement]] of [[Guyenne]] which stated that slavery was intolerable in France.&lt;ref&gt;Malick W. Ghachem, [https://books.google.com/books?id=btNeAEelkNMC&amp;pg=PA54 ''The Old Regime and the Haitian Revolution''], Cambridge University Press, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Born into slavery in [[Saint Domingue]], [[Thomas-Alexandre Dumas]] became free when his father brought him to France in 1776.

===''Code Noir'' and Age of Enlightenment===
[[File:Portrait of Chevalier de Saint-George.jpg|thumb|The [[Chevalier de Saint-Georges]], known as the "Black Mozart", was, by his social position, and by his political involvement, a figurehead of free blacks]]
As in other [[New World]] colonies, the French relied on the [[Atlantic slave trade]] for labour for their [[sugar cane]] [[plantations]] in their Caribbean colonies; the [[French West Indies]]. In addition, French colonists in ''[[Louisiane]]'' in North America held slaves, particularly in the South around [[New Orleans]], where they established sugarcane plantations.

[[Louis XIV]]'s ''[[Code Noir]]'' regulated the slave trade and institution in the colonies. It gave unparalleled rights to slaves. It included the right to marry, gather publicly, or take Sundays off. Although the ''Code Noir'' authorized and codified cruel corporal punishment against slaves under certain conditions, it forbade slave owners to torture them or to separate families. It also demanded enslaved Africans receive instruction in the Catholic faith, implying that Africans were human beings endowed with a soul, a fact French law did not admit until then. It resulted in a far higher percentage of blacks being free in 1830 (13.2% in [[History of slavery in Louisiana|Louisiana]] compared to 0.8% in [[History_of_Mississippi#Slavery|Mississippi]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Stark, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xkL0imZzlCoC&amp;pg=PA322&amp;dq=louisiana+slavery+difference+with+the+rest+of+south&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RjC6VOOEJMrpUrmUgoAJ&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=louisiana%20slavery%20difference%20with%20the%20rest%20of%20south&amp;f=false ''For the Glory of God: How Monotheism Led to Reformations, Science, Witch-hunts, and the End of Slavery''], Princeton University Press, 2003, 0p. 322. Note that there was typo in the original hardcover stating "31.2 percent"; this was corrected to 13.2% in the paperback edition and can be verified using 1830 census data.&lt;/ref&gt; They were on average exceptionally literate, with a significant number of them owning businesses, properties, and even slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4rYMEUqEToUC&amp;pg=PT1117&amp;dq=louisiana+slavery+difference+with+the+rest+of+south&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9jC6VPD_AsW1Ubv1g4AJ&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=louisiana%20slavery%20difference%20with%20the%20rest%20of%20south&amp;f=false|title=The Rough Guide to the USA|author= Samantha Cook, Sarah Hull|publisher=Rough Guides UK|date= 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.fr"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rn4p-eFL6oMC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=louisiana+code+noir&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Jzq6VO-MOcOxaZaqgJAB&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=louisiana%20code%20noir&amp;f=false|author=Terry L. Jones, |title=The Louisiana Journey|publisher=Gibbs Smith|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other free people of colour, such as [[Julien Raimond]], spoke out against slavery.

The ''Code Noir'' also forbade interracial marriages, but it was often ignored in French colonial society and the [[mulatto]]es became an intermediate caste between whites and blacks, while in the British colonies mulattoes and blacks were considered equal and discriminated against equally.&lt;ref name="books.google.fr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin H. Steinberg, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PM0zzm7wbvsC&amp;pg=PA725&amp;dq=louisiana+slavery+difference+with+the+rest+of+south&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5zC6VJvVHIz3UJOZgJAK&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=louisiana%20slavery%20difference%20with%20the%20rest%20of%20south&amp;f=false ''Disorders of Hemoglobin: Genetics, Pathophysiology, and Clinical Management''], pp. 725–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], many philosophers wrote pamphlets against slavery and its moral and economical justifications, including [[Montesquieu]] in ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748) and [[Denis Diderot]] in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''.&lt;ref name="lorenzo et al"/&gt;  In 1788, [[Jacques Pierre Brissot]] founded the [[Society of the Friends of the Blacks]] (''Société des Amis des Noirs'') to work for the abolition of slavery. After the Revolution, on 4 April 1792, France granted [[free people of colour]] full citizenship.

The slave revolt, in the largest Caribbean French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] in 1791, was the beginning of what became the [[Haitian Revolution]] led by formerly enslaved people like [[Georges Biassou]], [[Toussaint Louverture]], and [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]]. The rebellion swept through the north of the colony, and with it came freedom to thousands of enslaved blacks, but also violence and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/663393691 |title=Avengers of the New World: The Story of the Haitian Revolution |last=Dubois |first=Laurent |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2004 |isbn=9780674034365 |pages=91–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1793, French Civil Commissioners in St. Domingue and abolitionists, [[Léger-Félicité Sonthonax]] and [[Étienne Polverel]], issued the first emancipation proclamation of the modern world (Decree of 16 Pluviôse An II). The Convention sent them to safeguard the allegiance of the population to revolutionary France. The proclamation resulted in  crucial military strategy as it gradually brought most of the black troops into the French fold and kept the colony under the French flag for most of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U8IHym0hoQwC |title=You Are All Free: The Haitian Revolution and the Abolition of Slavery |last=Popkin |first=Jeremy D.  |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |isbn=0521517222 |pages=246–375}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connection with France lasted until blacks and free people of colour formed L'armée indigène in 1802 to resist [[Napoleon]]'s [[Saint-Domingue expedition|Expédition de Saint-Domingue]]. Victory over the French in the decisive battle of [[Battle of Vertières]] finally led to independence and the creation of present [[Haiti]] in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K65aBAAAQBAJ |title=The Haitian Revolution: A Documentary History |last=Geggus  |first=David |publisher=Hackett Publishing |year=2014 |isbn=1624661777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First general abolition of slavery (1794)===

[[File:Jacques Pierre Brissot (1754-1793).jpg|thumb|[[Jacques Pierre Brissot]] (1754–1793), who organized the [[Society of the Friends of the Blacks]] in 1788.]]

The Convention, the first elected Assembly of the [[French First Republic|First Republic]] (1792–1804), on 4 February 1794, under the leadership of [[Maximilien Robespierre]], abolished slavery in law in France and its colonies. [[Henri Grégoire|Abbé Grégoire]] and the Society of the Friends of the Blacks were part of the abolitionist movement, which had laid important groundwork in building anti-slavery sentiment in the [[Metropolitan France|metropole]]. The first article of the law stated that "Slavery was abolished" in the French colonies, while the second article stated that "slave-owners would be indemnified" with financial compensation for the value of their slaves.  The French constitution passed in 1795 included in the declaration of the Rights of Man that slavery was abolished.

===Re-establishment of slavery in the colonies (1802)===

During the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], French slave-owners massively joined the [[counter-revolution]] and, through the [[Whitehall Accord (1794)|Whitehall Accord]], they threatened to move the French Caribbean colonies under British control, as Great Britain still allowed slavery. Fearing secession from these islands, successfully lobbied by planters and concerned about revenues from the West Indies, and influenced by the slaveholder family of [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|his wife]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] decided to re-establish slavery after becoming [[First Consul]]. He promulgated the [[law of 20 May 1802]] and sent military governors and troops to the colonies to impose it. On 10 May 1802, [[Louis Delgrès|Colonel Delgrès]] launched a rebellion in [[Guadeloupe]] against Napoleon's representative, [[Antoine Richepanse|General Richepanse]]. The rebellion was repressed, and slavery was re-established. The news of this event sparked another wave of rebellion in Saint-Domingue. Although from 1802, Napoleon sent more than 20,000 troops to the island, two-thirds died mostly due to yellow fever. He withdrew the remaining 7,000 troops and slaves achieved an independent republic they called [[Haïti]] in 1804. Seeing the failure of the [[Saint-Domingue expedition]], in 1803 Napoleon decided to [[Louisiana Purchase|sell]] the [[Louisiana Territory]] to the United States. The French governments initially refused to recognize Haiti. It forced the nation to pay a substantial amount of reparations (which it could ill afford) for losses during the revolution and did not recognize its government until 1825.

===Second abolition (1848) and subsequent events===
[[File:Biard Abolition de l'esclavage 1849.jpg|thumb|left|"Abolition of Slavery in French Colonies, 1848" by [[Auguste François Biard]] (1849).]]

On 27 April 1848, under the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] (1848–52), the [[decree-law]] of [[Victor Schoelcher|Schœlcher]] abolished slavery in the remaining colonies. The state bought the slaves from the ''colons'' (white colonists; ''[[:fr:Béké|Békés]]'' in [[Creole language|Creole]]), and then freed them.

At about the same time, France started colonizing Africa and gained possession of much of West Africa by 1900. In 1905, the French abolished slavery in most of [[French West Africa]]. The French also attempted to abolish Tuareg slavery following the [[Kaocen Revolt]]. In the region of the Sahel, slavery has however long persisted.

Passed on 10 May 2001, the [[Christiane Taubira|Taubira law]] officially acknowledges slavery and the Atlantic Slave Trade as a [[crime against humanity]]. 10 May was chosen as the day dedicated to recognition of the crime of slavery.

The last known form of enforced servitude of adults ([[villein]]age) had disappeared in England by the beginning of the 17th century. In 1569 a  court considered the case of Cartwright, who had bought a slave from Russia. The court ruled English law could not recognize slavery, as it was never established officially. This ruling was overshadowed by later developments; It was upheld in 1700 by the Lord Chief Justice [[John Holt (Lord Chief Justice)|John Holt]] when he ruled that a slave became free as soon as he arrived in England.&lt;ref&gt;V.

In addition to English colonists importing slaves to the North American colonies, by the 18th century, traders began to import slaves from Africa, India and East Asia (where they were trading) to [[London]] and [[Edinburgh]] to work as personal servants. Men who migrated to the North American colonies often took their East Indian slaves or servants with them, as [[East Indians]] have been documented in colonial records.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Heinegg, [http://www.freeafricanamericans.com ''Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'', 1999–2005], "WEAVER FAMILY: Three members of the Weaver family, probably brothers, were called 'East Indians' in Lancaster County, [VA] [court records] between 1707 and 1711."

Some of the first [[freedom suits]], court cases in the British Isles to challenge the legality of slavery, took place in Scotland in 1755 and 1769. The cases were ''Montgomery v. Sheddan'' (1755) and ''Spens v. Dalrymple'' (1769). Each of the slaves had been baptized in Scotland and challenged the legality of slavery. They set the precedent of legal procedure in British courts that would later lead to successful outcomes for the plaintiffs. In these cases, deaths of the plaintiff and defendant, respectively, brought an end before court decisions.&lt;ref name="The National Archives of Scotland"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nas.gov.uk/about/071022.asp |title=Slavery, freedom or perpetual servitude? – the Joseph Knight case |publisher=[[National Archives of Scotland]]|accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African slaves were not bought or sold in London but were brought by masters from other areas. Together with people from other nations, especially non-Christian, Africans were considered foreigners, not able to be English subjects. At the time, England had no [[naturalization]] procedure. The African slaves' legal status was unclear until 1772 and [[Somersett's Case]], when the fugitive slave James Somersett forced a decision by the courts. Somersett had escaped, and his master, Charles Steuart, had him captured and imprisoned on board a ship, intending to ship him to [[Jamaica]] to be resold into slavery. While in London, Somersett had been [[baptism|baptized]]; three godparents issued a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]''. As a result, [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], Chief Justice of the [[King's Bench|Court of the King's Bench]], had to judge whether Somersett's abduction was lawful or not under English [[Common Law]]. No legislation had ever been passed to establish slavery in England. The case received national attention, and five advocates supported the action on behalf of Somersett.

In his judgement of 22 June 1772, Mansfield declared:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The state of slavery is of such a nature that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political, but only by positive law, which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasions, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory. It is so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from a decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Charles Moncrieff, ''The Wit and Wisdom of the Bench and Bar'', The Lawbook Exchange, 2006, pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the [[Slavery at common law|exact legal implications]] of the judgement are unclear when analysed by lawyers, the judgement was generally taken at the time to have determined that slavery did not exist under English common law and was thus prohibited in England.&lt;ref&gt;Mowat, Robert Balmain, ''History of the English-Speaking Peoples'', Oxford University Press, 1943, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision did not apply to the British overseas territories; by then, for example, the American colonies had established slavery by positive laws.&lt;ref&gt;MacEwen, Martin, ''Housing, Race and Law: The British Experience'', Routledge, 2002, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Somersett's case became a significant part of the common law of slavery in the English-speaking world and it helped launch the movement to abolish slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Peter P. Hinks, John R. McKivigan, R. Owen Williams, ''Encyclopedia of Antislavery and Abolition'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007, p. 643.&lt;/ref&gt;

After reading about Somersett's Case, [[Joseph Knight (slave)|Joseph Knight]], an enslaved African who had been purchased by his master John Wedderburn in Jamaica and brought to Scotland, left him. Married and with a child, he filed a [[freedom suit]], on the grounds that he could not be held as a slave in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. In the case of ''[[Knight v. Wedderburn]]'' (1778), Wedderburn said that Knight owed him "perpetual servitude". The [[Court of Session]] of Scotland ruled against him, saying that [[Chattel slavery|chattel]] slavery was not recognized under the [[law of Scotland]], and slaves could seek court protection to leave a master or avoid being forcibly removed from Scotland to be returned to slavery in the colonies.&lt;ref name="The National Archives of Scotland"/&gt;

In 1783, an anti-slavery movement began among the British public to end slavery throughout the British Empire. In 1785, the English poet [[William Cowper]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
We have no slaves at home.—Then why abroad?
And they themselves once ferried o'er the wave
That parts us, are emancipate and loos'd.
Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs
Receive our air, that moment they are free,
They touch our country and their shackles fall.
That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud
And jealous of the blessing. Spread it then,
And let it circulate through ev'ry vein
Of all your empire. That where Britain's power
Is felt, mankind may feel her mercy too.
&lt;p&gt;(from ''The Task'', Book 2)&lt;ref&gt;Cowper, William, ''The task: a poem, in six books. By William Cowper, ...'' (London: printed for J. Johnson, 1785), p. 47.

After the formation of the [[Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] in 1787, [[William Wilberforce]] led the cause of abolition through the parliamentary campaign. [[Thomas Clarkson]] became the group's most prominent researcher, gathering vast amounts of data on the trade. One aspect of abolitionism during this period was the effective use of images such as the famous [[Josiah Wedgwood]] "[[Am I Not A Man And A Brother|Am I Not A Man And A Brother?]]" anti-slavery medallion of 1787.  Clarkson described the medallion as "promoting the cause of justice, humanity and freedom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, the act repealed the effort to improve conditions for slaves: [[Amelioration Act 1798|amelioration]]. The end of the slave trade did not end slavery as a whole. Slavery was still a common practice.

In the 1820s, the abolitionist movement revived to campaign against the institution of slavery itself. In 1823 the first [[Anti-Slavery Society]] was founded. Many of its members had previously campaigned against the slave trade. On August 28, 1833, the [[Slavery Abolition Act]] was given [[Royal Assent]], which paved the way for the abolition of slavery throughout the British Empire, which was substantially achieved in 1838. In 1839, the [[British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]] was formed by [[Joseph Sturge]], which attempted to outlaw slavery worldwide and also to pressure the government to help enforce the suppression of the slave trade by declaring [[slave traders]] [[pirate]]s. The world's oldest international human rights organization, it continues today as [[Anti-Slavery International]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160513171717/http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=9462&amp;URL_DO=DO_PRINTPAGE&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Anti-Slavery International] UNESCO.

In the principalities of [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], the government held slavery of the [[Romani people|Roma]] (often referred to as Gypsies) [[Slavery in Romania|as legal]] at the beginning of the 19th century. The progressive pro-European and anti-Ottoman movement, which gradually gained power in the two principalities, also worked to abolish that slavery. Between 1843 and 1855, the principalities emancipated all of the 250,000 enslaved Roma people.&lt;ref&gt;Viorel Achim (2010).

Bartolomé de las Casas was a 16th-century [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest, the first resident Bishop of [[Chiapas]]. As a settler in the [[New World]] he witnessed and opposed the poor treatment of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] by the Spanish colonists. He advocated before King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] on behalf of rights for the natives. Originally supporting the importation of African slaves as labourers, he eventually changed and became an advocate for the Africans in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3184668.stm |title=Columbus 'sparked a genocide' |accessdate=21 October 2006 |date=12 October 2003 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Blackburn 1997: 136; Friede 1971:165–66.

His book, ''[[A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies]]'', contributed to Spanish passage of colonial legislation known as the [[New Laws of 1542]], which abolished native slavery for the first time in European colonial history. It ultimately led to the [[Valladolid debate]].

During the early 19th century, slavery expanded rapidly in Brazil, Cuba, and the United States, while at the same time the new republics of mainland Spanish America became committed to the gradual abolition of slavery.  During the [[Spanish American wars of independence|Spanish American wars for independence]] (1810–1826), slavery was abolished in most of Latin America, though it continued until 1873 in [[Afro-Puerto Ricans#Abolition of slavery|Puerto Rico]], 1886 in Cuba, and 1888 in Brazil (where it was abolished by the ''[[Lei Áurea]]'', the "Golden Law"). Chile declared [[freedom of wombs]] in 1811, followed by the [[United Provinces of the River Plate]] in 1813, but without abolishing slavery completely. While Chile abolished slavery in 1823, Argentina did so with the signing of the [[Argentine Constitution of 1853]]. Colombia abolished slavery in 1852.  Slavery was abolished in Uruguay during the ''[[Uruguayan Civil War|Guerra Grande]]'', by both the government of [[Fructuoso Rivera]] and the [[government in exile]] of [[Manuel Oribe]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hinks and John McKivigan, eds.

In 1772, prior to the American Revolution, Britain [[Somerset v Stewart|outlawed the slave trade in the British Isles]] followed by the [[Joseph Knight (slave)|Knight v. Wedderburn]] decision in Scotland in 1778. This decision, in turn, influenced the colony of Nova Scotia.  In 1788, abolitionist [[James Drummond MacGregor]] from Pictou published the first anti-slavery literature in Canada and began purchasing slaves' freedom and chastising his colleagues in the Presbyterian church who owned slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/macgregor_james_drummond_6E.html|title=Biography – MacGregor James Drummond – Volume VI (1821–1835) – Dictionary of Canadian Biography|work=biographi.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1790 [[John Burbidge]] freed his slaves.

With slaves escaping to New York and New England, legislation for gradual emancipation was passed in [[Upper Canada]] (1793) and [[Lower Canada]] (1803). In Upper Canada the Assembly ruled that no slaves could be imported; slaves already in the province would remain enslaved until death, no new slaves could be brought into Upper Canada, and children born to female slaves would be slaves but must be freed at the age of 25. In practice, some slavery continued until abolished in the entire [[British Empire]] in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Winks, ''Blacks in Canada: A History'' (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UncleTomsCabinCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' inflamed public opinion in the North and Britain against the evils of slavery.]]
The historian [[James M. McPherson]] defines an abolitionist "as one who before the Civil War had agitated for the immediate, unconditional, and total abolition of slavery in the United States."&lt;ref name="McPherson1995"/&gt;  He does not include antislavery activists such as Abraham Lincoln or the Republican Party, which called for the gradual ending of slavery.&lt;ref name="McPherson1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=James M.

The first attempts to end slavery in the British/American colonies came from [[Thomas Jefferson]] and some of his contemporaries. Despite the fact that Jefferson was a lifelong slaveholder, he included strong anti-slavery language in the original draft of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], but other delegates took it out.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#TJFslavery|Monticello Foundation, 2012]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Franklin]], also a slaveholder for much of his life, became a leading member of the [[Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery]], the first recognized organization for abolitionists in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Seymour Stanton Black|title=Benjamin Franklin: Genius of Kites, Flights,  and Voting Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[American Revolutionary War]], Northern states abolished slavery, beginning with the [[1777 constitution of Vermont]], followed by [[Pennsylvania's gradual emancipation act in 1780]]. Other states with more of an economic interest in slaves, such as New York and New Jersey, also passed gradual emancipation laws, and by 1804, all the northern states had abolished it. Some slaves continued to live in servitude for two more decades but most were freed.

Also in the postwar years, individual slaveholders, particularly in the Upper South, manumitted slaves, sometimes in their wills. Many noted that they had been moved by the revolutionary ideals of the equality of men. The number of free blacks as a proportion of the black population increased from less than one percent to nearly ten percent from 1790 to 1810 in the Upper South as a result of these actions.

As President, on 2 March 1807, Jefferson signed the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves]]  and it took effect in 1808, which was the earliest allowed under the Constitution. In 1820 he privately supported the [[Missouri Compromise]], believing it would help to end slavery.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Peterson60|Peterson, 1960]] p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; He left the anti-slavery struggle to younger men after that.{{sfn|Cogliano|2006|p=219}}

In the 1850s in the fifteen states constituting the [[Southern United States|American South]], slavery was legally established. While it was fading away in the cities as well as in the border states, it remained strong in plantation areas that grew cotton for export, or sugar, tobacco or hemp. According to the [[1860 United States Census]], the slave population in the United States had grown to four million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/manassas/social/introsoc.htm Introduction – Social Aspects of the Civil War] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714073725/http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/manassas/social/introsoc.htm |date=14 July 2007 }}, National Park Service.&lt;/ref&gt; American abolitionism was based in the North, and white Southerners alleged it fostered slave rebellion.

In churches, coventions, and newspapers, these reformers promoted an absolute and immediate rejection of both alcohol and slavery. The connection between temperance and antislavery views remained strong throughout the 1840s and 1850s. The white abolitionists Arthur Tappan and Gerrit Smith helped lead the American Temperance Union, formed in 1833. Frederick Douglass, who took the teetotaler pledge while in Scotland in 1845, claimed, "I am a temperance man because I am an anti-slavery man." Activists argued that alcohol aided slavery by keeping enslaved men and women addled and by sapping the strength of free black communities.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VenturelliFleckenstein2017"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Venturelli |first1=Peter J. |last2=Fleckenstein |first2=Annette E. |title=Drugs and Society |date=2017 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |isbn=9781284110876 |pages=252 |language=English|quote=Because the temperance movement was closely tied to the abolitionist movement as well as to the African American church, African Americans were preeminent promoters of temperance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The white abolitionist movement in the North was led by social reformers, especially [[William Lloyd Garrison]], founder of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]]; writers such as [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] and [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. Black activists included former slaves such as [[Frederick Douglass]]; and free blacks such as the brothers [[Charles Henry Langston]] and [[John Mercer Langston]], who helped found the Ohio Anti-Slavery Society.&lt;ref&gt;Leon F. Litwack and August Meier, eds., "John Mercer Langston: Principle and Politics", in ''Black Leaders of the 19th century'', University of Illinois Press, 1991, pp. 106–11&lt;/ref&gt;  Some abolitionists said that slavery was criminal and a sin; they also criticized slave owners of using black women as [[concubines]] and taking sexual advantage of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[James A.

The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] wanted to achieve the gradual extinction of slavery by market forces, because its members believed that free labor was superior to slave labor. Southern leaders said that the Republican policy of blocking the expansion of slavery into the West made them second-class citizens, and they also said it challenged their autonomy. With the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential victory]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]], seven Deep South states whose economy was based on cotton and slavery decided to secede and form a new nation. The [[American Civil War]] broke out in April 1861 with the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|firing on Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]]. When Lincoln called for troops to suppress the rebellion, four more slave states seceded.

====Civil War and final emancipation====
[[File:Mustered out, harper's weekly, little rock, AR.jpg|right|thumb|Black volunteer soldiers muster out to their first freedom, ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', 1866]]
Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was an executive order of the U.S. government issued on 1 January 1863, changing the legal status of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from "slave" to "free". Slaves were legally freed by the Proclamation and became actually free by escaping to federal lines, or by advances of federal troops. Many served the federal army as teamsters, cooks, laundresses, and laborers. Plantation owners, realizing the emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army.&lt;ref&gt;Leon F. Litwack, ''Been in the Storm So Long: The Aftermath of Slavery'' (1979), pp. 30–36, 105–66.&lt;/ref&gt; By "[[Juneteenth]]" (19 June 1865, in Texas), the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and liberated all its slaves. The owners were never compensated.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Vorenberg, ed., ''The Emancipation Proclamation: A Brief History with Documents'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kolchin, "Reexamining Southern Emancipation in Comparative Perspective," ''Journal of Southern History'', 81#1 (February 2015), 7–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The border states were exempt from the Emancipation Proclamation, but they too (except Delaware) began their own emancipation programmes.&lt;ref name="History Channel on the emancipation Proclamation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foner|first1=Eric|last2=Garraty|first2=John A.|title=Emancipation Proclamation |url=http://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/emancipation-proclamation|website=|publisher=History Channel|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Union Army entered Confederate areas, thousands of slaves escaped to freedom behind Union Army lines, and in 1863 many men started serving as the [[United States Colored Troops]]. The [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] took effect in December 1865 and finally ended slavery throughout the United States. It also abolished slavery among the Indian tribes, including the Alaska tribes that became part of the U.S. in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom: The Civil War, the Abolition of Slavery, and the Thirteenth Amendment'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemoration==
The abolitionist movements and the abolition of slavery have been commemorated in different ways around the world in modern times. The United Nations General Assembly declared 2004 the [[International Year to Commemorate the Struggle against Slavery and its Abolition]]. This proclamation marked the bicentenary of the birth of the first black state, Haiti. Numerous exhibitions, events and research programmes were connected to the initiative.

2007 witnessed major exhibitions in British museums and galleries to mark the anniversary of the 1807 abolition act – 1807 Commemorated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.ac.uk/1807commemorated |title=1807 Commemorated |publisher=Institute for the Public Understanding of the Past and the Institute of Historical Research |year=2007 |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2008 marks the 201st anniversary of the Abolition of the Slave Trade in the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Slave Trade Act 1807 UK |url=http://www.anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/huk-1807act.htm |publisher=anti-slaverysociety.addr.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also marks the 175th anniversary of the abolition of Slavery in the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Slavery Abolition Act 1833 UK |url=http://www.anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/huk-1833act.htm |publisher=anti-slaverysociety.addr.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Faculty of Law at the University of Ottawa held a major international conference entitled, "Routes to Freedom:  Reflections on the Bicentenary of the Abolition of the Slave Trade", from 14 to 16 March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abolition1807-2007.uottawa.ca |title=Les Chemins de la Liberté : Réflexions à l'occasion du bicentenaire de l'abolition de l'esclavage / Routes to Freedom : Reflections on the Bicentenary of the Abolition of the Slave Trade |publisher=[[University of Ottawa]], Canada |accessdate=27 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511100645/http://www.abolition1807-2007.uottawa.ca/ |archivedate=11 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Actor and human rights activist [[Danny Glover]] delivered the keynote speech announcing the creation of two major scholarships intended for University of Ottawa law students specializing in international law and social justice at the conference's gala dinner.

Brooklyn, New York, has begun work on commemorating the abolitionist movement in New York.

On 10 December 1948, the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the United Nations adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Article 4 states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although outlawed in most countries, slavery is nonetheless practised secretly in many parts of the world.  Enslavement still takes place in the [[Human trafficking in the United States|United States]], Europe, and Latin America,&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Bales|Bales, Kevin]]. ''Ending Slavery: How We Free Today's Slaves.'' University of California Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-520-25470-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as parts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/slavery.htm "Does Slavery Still Exist?"] Anti-Slavery Society.&lt;/ref&gt; There are an estimated 27 million victims of slavery worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.un.org/Pubs/chronicle/2005/issue3/0305p28.html |title=Slavery in the Twenty-First Century |work=UN Chronicle |year=2005 |volume=Issue 3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412155246/http://www.un.org/Pubs/chronicle/2005/issue3/0305p28.html |archivedate=12 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Mauritania alone, estimates are that up to 600,000 men, women and children, or 20% of the population, are enslaved.  Many of them are used as [[bonded labour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6938032.stm |title=Mauritanian MPs pass slavery law |publisher= [[BBC]] |work=BBC News |date=9 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern-day abolitionists have emerged over the last several years, as awareness of slavery around the world has grown, with groups such as [[Anti-Slavery International]], the [[American Anti-Slavery Group]], [[International Justice Mission]], and [[Free the Slaves]] working to rid the world of slavery.

In the United States, The Action Group to End Human Trafficking and Modern-Day Slavery is a coalition of NGOs, [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundations]] and corporations working to develop a policy agenda for abolishing slavery and human trafficking.  Since 1997, the [[United States Department of Justice]] has, through work with the [[Coalition of Immokalee Workers]], prosecuted six individuals in Florida on charges of slavery in the agricultural industry.  These prosecutions have led to freedom for over 1000 enslaved workers in the tomato and orange fields of South Florida.  This is only one example of the contemporary fight against slavery worldwide.  Slavery exists most widely in agricultural labour, apparel and sex industries, and service jobs in some regions.

In 2000, the United States passed the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (TVPA) "to combat trafficking in persons, especially into the sex trade, slavery, and involuntary servitude."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/10492.pdf ''Public Law 106–386 – 28 October 2000, Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The TVPA also "created new law enforcement tools to strengthen the prosecution and punishment of traffickers, making human trafficking a Federal crime with severe penalties."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/trafficking/about/TVPA_2000.pdf US Department of Health and Human Services] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910001330/http://www.acf.hhs.gov/trafficking/about/TVPA_2000.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }}, TVPA Fact Sheet.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, for the first time in history major Anglican, Catholic, and Orthodox Christian leaders, as well as Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist leaders, met to sign a shared commitment against modern-day slavery; the declaration they signed calls for the elimination of slavery and human trafficking by the year 2020.&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/6256640|title=Pope Francis And Other Religious Leaders Sign Declaration Against Modern Slavery|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signatories were: [[Pope Francis]], Her Holiness [[Mata Amritanandamayi|Mātā Amṛtānandamayī]] (also known as Amma), Venerable Bhikkhuni Thich Nu [[Chân Không]] (representing Zen Master [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]]), The Most Ven. [[Datuk K Sri Dhammaratana]], Chief High Priest of Malaysia, Rabbi Dr. [[Abraham Skorka]], Rabbi Dr. David Rosen, Dr. [[Abbas Abdalla Abbas Soliman]], Undersecretary of State of Al Azhar Alsharif (representing [[Mohamed Ahmed El-Tayeb]], Grand Imam of Al-Azhar), Grand Ayatollah [[Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi]], Sheikh [[Naziyah Razzaq Jaafar]], Special advisor of Grand Ayatollah (representing Grand Ayatollah Sheikh [[Basheer Hussain al Najafi]]), Sheikh [[Omar Abboud]], Most Revd and Right Hon [[Justin Welby]], Archbishop of Canterbury, and His Eminence Metropolitan Emmanuel of France (representing His All-Holiness Ecumenical [[Patriarch Bartholomew]].)&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post"/&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] publishes the annual Trafficking in Persons Report, identifying countries as either Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 2 Watch List or Tier 3, depending upon three factors: "(1) The extent to which the country is a country of origin, transit, or destination for severe forms of trafficking; (2) The extent to which the government of the country does not comply with the TVPA's minimum standards including, in particular, the extent of the government's trafficking-related corruption; and (3) The resources and capabilities of the government to address and eliminate severe forms of trafficking in persons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2008/105376.htm |title=US Department of State Trafficking in Persons Report 2008, Introduction |publisher=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though their claim has been disputed, members of the Abolish Human Abortion campaign consider themselves to be within the abolitionist tradition, as they compare [[abortion]] with slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/melissa-harris-perry/meet-the-rebels-the-anti-abortion-movement|title=Meet the rebels of the anti-abortion movement |date=8 March 2014|publisher=[[MSNBC]] |language=English|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', the popular 1843 novella by [[Charles Dickens]] (1812–1870), is one of the British author's best-known works. It is the story of [[Ebenezer Scrooge]], a greedy miser who hates Christmas, but is transformed into a caring, kindly person through the visitations of four ghosts. The classic work has been dramatised and adapted countless times for virtually every medium and performance genre, and new versions appear regularly.

== Adaptations ==
=== Public readings ===
The novel was the subject of Dickens' first public reading, given in [[Birmingham Town Hall]] to the Industrial and Literary Institute on 27 December 1852. This was repeated three days later to an audience of 'working people', and was a great success by his own account and that of newspapers of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, Michael (2009). ''Charles Dickens''. New Haven, CT and London: Yale University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-300-16552-4}}. p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, Dickens edited and adapted the piece for a listening, rather than reading, audience. Excerpts from ''A Christmas Carol'' remained part of Dickens' public readings until his death.

Several performers tour shows in which they perform the public readings in character as Dickens.

=== Theatre ===

==Global beginnings of life==
Fossil life of 3.5 billion years of age is also found in the [[Pilbara craton]] of western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schopf|first=J.W.|title=Fossil evidence of Archaean life|journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] |year=2006|volume=361|pages=869–885 |pmc=1578735 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1834 |pmid=16754604}}&lt;/ref&gt; This evidence, along with Barberton fossils, show that cellular life must have existed by this point in the evolution of Earth. There is work that potentially demonstrates life at 3.8 billion years ago, in what is now western [[Greenland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mojzsis|first=S.J.|author2=Arrhenius, G.|author3=Keegan, K.D.|author4=Harrison, T.H.|author5=Nutman, A.P.|author6=Friend, C.L.R. |title=Evidence for life on earth 3,800 million years ago|journal=Nature|year=2007|volume=384|pages=55–58 |doi=10.1038/384055a0|issue=6604|pmid=8900275|bibcode = 1996Natur.384...55M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKeegan|first=K.

It is important to note that cellular life existed 3.5 billion years ago and thus it evolved prior to this time. Because the Earth is 4.5 billion years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patterson|first=C.|title=Age of meteorites and the Earth|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|year=1956|volume=10|pages=230–237 |doi=10.1016/0016-7037(56)90036-9 |url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/WebDocuments/Patterson1956.pdf|bibcode=1956GeCoA..10..230P}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is a window of about one billion years for cellular life to evolve from a lifeless earth.

== Archean tectonic history of the Barberton Greenstone Belt ==
The [[Barberton Greenstone Belt]] is located on the [[Kaapvaal craton]], which covers much of the southeastern part of Africa, and was formed by the emplacement of [[granitoid]] [[batholiths]].&lt;ref name=Cheney/&gt; The Kaapvaal craton was once part of a [[supercontinent]] geologists term [[Vaalbara]] that also included the [[Pilbara craton]] of western Australia.&lt;ref name=Cheney&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheney|first=E.S.|title=Sequence stratigraphy and plate tectonic significance of the Transvaal succession of southern Africa and its equivalent in Western Australia|journal=Precambrian Research|year=1996|volume=79|pages=3–24 |doi=10.1016/0301-9268(95)00085-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the exact timing is still debated, it is likely that Vaalbara existed from approximately 3.6 to 2.2 billion years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zegers|first=T.E. |author2=de Wit, M. |author3=Dann, J. |author4=White, S.H. |title=Vaalbara, Earth's oldest assembled continent?

== Evidence for life ==
Preserved life in Archean rocks has been altered over its 3.5 billion year history and, thus, can be difficult to distinguish. The [[cell wall]] structure can be preserved, but the original composition changes over time and becomes [[Mineralization (geology)|mineralised]]. There are six established criteria to determine the plausibility of a given [[microstructure]] being a [[microfossil]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schopf|first=J.W.|author2=Walter,M.R. |chapter=Archean microfossils: new evidence of ancient microbes|editor=Schopf, J.W.|title= Earth's Earliest Biosphere|publisher=Princeton University Press |location=New Jersey|year=1983|pages=214–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buick |first=R. |title=Carbonaceous filaments from North Pole, Western Australia: are they fossil bacteria in Archaean stromatolites? |journal=Precambrian Research |year=1984 |volume=24 |pages=157–172 |doi=10.1016/0301-9268(84)90056-1 |url=http://0-quest.arc.nasa.gov.iii-server.ualr.edu/projects/spacewardbound/australia2011/resources/Awramik%20Schopf%20Walter%20Carbonaceous%20filaments%20from%20North%20Pole.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231746/http://0-quest.arc.nasa.gov.iii-server.ualr.edu/projects/spacewardbound/australia2011/resources/Awramik%20Schopf%20Walter%20Carbonaceous%20filaments%20from%20North%20Pole.pdf |archivedate=25 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

#True microfossils should be of relatively abundant occurrence.
#True microfossils should be of [[carbon]]aceous composition or, if mineralic, be biologically [[precipitated]] (for example, some bacteria form [[pyrite]] due to [[metabolic]] processes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ohmoto|first=H.|author2=Kakegawa, T.|author3=Lowe, D.R.|title=3.4-Billion-year-old biogenic pyrites from Barberton, South Africa: sulfur isotope evidence|journal=Science|year=1993|volume=262|pages=555–557 |doi=10.1126/science.11539502|bibcode = 1993Sci...262..555O }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#True microfossils should exhibit biological [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. (see following section)
#True microfossils should occur in a geologically plausible context (for example, there are no microfossils in [[igneous]] rock, because life cannot grow in [[molten]] lava).
# True microfossils should fit within a well-established [[evolutionary]] context (for example, complex microfossils are highly unlikely to exist at 3.5 billion years, as they have yet to evolve from their more simple cellular ancestors).
#True microfossils should be dissimilar from non-biogenic [[carbonaceous matter]]. (see [[#Isotope analysis|Isotope analysis]] section)

=== Cell morphology ===
Cells are preserved in the rock record because their cell walls are made of proteins which convert to the organic material [[kerogen]] as the cell breaks down after death. Kerogen is [[insoluble]] in mineral [[acids]], [[base (chemistry)|base]]s, and [[organic solvents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Philp|first=R.P.|author2=Calvin, M. |title=Possible origin for insoluble organic (kerogen) debris in sediments from insoluble cell-wall materials of algae and bacteria|journal=Nature|year=1976|volume=262|pages=134–136 |doi=10.1038/262134a0|issue=5564|bibcode = 1976Natur.262..134P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, it is mineralised into [[graphite]] or graphite-like [[carbon]], or degrades into oil and gas hydrocarbons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tegelaar|first=E.W.|author2=deLeeuw, J.W.|author3=Derenne, S.|author4=Largeau, C. |title=A reappraisal of kerogen formation|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|year=1989|volume=53|issue=11|pages=3103–3106 |doi=10.1016/0016-7037(89)90191-9|bibcode=1989GeCoA..53.3103T}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Microfossil Morphologies-1.png|thumb|Three main types of Archaean cell morphologies]]
There are three main types of cell morphologies. Though there is no established range of sizes for each type, spheroid microfossils can be as small as about 8&amp;nbsp;μm, filamentous microfossils have diameters typically less than 5&amp;nbsp;μm and have a length that can range from tens of μm to 100&amp;nbsp;μm, and spindle-like microfossils can be as long as 50&amp;nbsp;μm.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Oehler, D.Z. |author2=Robert, F. |author3=Mostefaoui, S. |author4=Meibom, A. |author5=Selo, M. |author6=McKay, D.S.|title=Chemical Mapping of Proterozoic Organic Matter at Submicron Spatial Resolution|journal=Astrobiology|year=2006|volume=6|issue=6|pages=838–850 |pmid=17155884 |doi=10.1089/ast.2006.6.838|bibcode = 2006AsBio...6..838O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotope analysis===
Stable [[isotope fractionation]] is a useful way of characterising [[organic matter|organic]] [[carbon]] and [[inorganic]] carbon. These numbers are reported as {{delta|13|C|link}} values, where C is for the [[chemical element]] carbon. Isotope analysis of inorganic carbon typically yields δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C values heavier than −10 [[per mil]], with numbers usually falling between −5 and 5 per mil. Organic carbon, however, has δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C values that range from −20 per mil for [[photoautotrophic]] bacteria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schidlowski|first=M.|author2=Hayes, J.M.|author3=Kaplan, I.R.|chapter=&lt;!-- {{title incomplete}} --&gt; |title=Earth's Early Biosphere|year=1983|editor=J.W. Schopf|pages=149–186 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; to −60 per mil for microbial communities that recycle [[methane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schidlowski|first=M|title=A 3,800-million-year isotope record of life from carbon in sedimentary rocks|journal=Nature|year=1988|volume=333|pages=313–318 |doi=10.1038/333313a0|issue=6171|bibcode=1988Natur.333..313S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large range in values for organic carbon has to do with the [[cellular metabolism]]. For instance, an [[organism]] that uses [[photosynthesis]] (a [[phototroph]]) will have a different isotope δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C value than an organism that relies on chemical substances for energy (an [[autotroph]]).

== Fossil record ==
The oldest microfossils from the Barberton Greenstone belt are found in the Onverwacht Group, specifically, in both the Kromberg and Hooggenoeg Formations.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; Both of these formations are predominantly [[igneous rock]]; the [[sedimentary rock]] has been metamorphosed. However, it is still possible to find microfossils in [[chert]], a type of [[evaporite]] that forms in [[sedimentary]] environments. From the evidence in these rocks, it is likely that early life existed in the form of [[microbial mats]] and [[stromatolites]]. Evidence for this hypothesis is preserved in both chert and [[lithified]] stromatolites.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt;

Stromatolites represent large colonies of [[microorganisms]], and are found both in the fossil record and rarely in modern hypersaline environments. A typical stromatolite consists of alternating layers of sediment and [[microbes]]. The microbes are [[photosynthetic]]; thus stromatolites represent shallow water environments in the fossil record due to their necessity to exist in the [[photic zone]] of water bodies. Stromatolites typically consist of filamentous microfossils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byerly|first=G.R.|author2=Lowe, D.R.|author3=Walsh, M.|title=Stromatolites from the 3,300 to 3,500-myr Swaziland Supergroup, Barberton Mountain Land, South Africa|journal=Nature|year=1986|volume=319|pages=489–491 |doi=10.1038/319489a0|issue=6053|bibcode = 1986Natur.319..489B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest stromatolites have been dated to approximately 3.5 billion years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allwood|first=A.|author2=Kamber, B.S.|author3=Walter, M.R.|author4=Burch, I.W.|author5=Kanik, I. |title=Trace elements record depositional history of an Early Archaean stromatolitic carbonate platform|journal=[[Chemical Geology]]|year=2010|volume=270|pages=148–163 |doi=10.1016/j.chemgeo.2009.11.013 |url=http://spacewardbound.nasa.gov/australia2011/resources/Allwood%20etal%202010%20stromatolite%20geochemistry.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stromatolites in Barberton have been dated to about 3.3 billion years.

Microfossils found in [[chert]] extend the Barberton microfossil record back to 3.5 billion years. All three types of microfossil morphologies are found in cherts. Chert can have a variety of colours, but microfossils are typically found in black cherts, as the dark color can indicate [[organic matter|organic]] material.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt;

== Future applications ==
Scientists have established the approximate age that life first appears in the fossil record, but that doesn't necessarily equal the time that life first evolved on Earth. Though fossils have not been found in older rocks, evidence for life can be found in other ways, such as extended carbon [[isotope]] data and [[Raman Spectroscopy]]. There is also ongoing work within the scientific community to solve the problem of how cellular life evolved in a hostile early earth.

==The Bible and Flying Saucers==
Downing wrote ''The Bible and Flying Saucers'' in 1968. He wrote in the book that [[Jesus]] was an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] sent to earth to rid the world of sin and wickedness, he cited biblical lines such as Jesus was from another world (John 8: 23) to support his claims, Downing also believed that Jesus left earth in a [[flying saucer]] to another planet, or perhaps another spatial dimension. In the book Downing claimed that [[angels]] from the Bible were actually aliens and that the "angelic aliens" spoke to [[Moses]] on [[Mount Sinai]] where he boarded a UFO to receive [[stone tablets]], and specifications for the construction of the [[Tabernacle]]. According to Downing, [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] spoke to [[Elijah]] and guided the ancient [[Israelites]], providing them with [[manna]] in the wilderness. Downing also claimed in the book that a flying vehicle operated by intelligent alien beings was responsible for the parting of the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip H.

[[File:Bart De Wever.JPG|thumb|Bart De Wever in 2004]]
'''Bart Albert Liliane De Wever''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈbɑrt də ˈʋeːvər|lang}}; born 21 December 1970) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] politician. Since 2004 De Wever has been the leader of the [[New Flemish Alliance]] (N-VA), a Belgian political party advocating independence for the [[Flemish]] region of Belgium within the [[European Union]]; he is also a member of the [[Chamber of Representatives (Belgium)|Chamber of Representatives]]. He played a prominent role in the [[2007 Belgian government formation]] and presided over his party's victory in the [[Belgian federal election, 2010|2010 federal elections]] when N-VA became the largest party in both Flanders and in Belgium as a whole.

Since January 2013 he has been [[List of mayors of Antwerp|Mayor of Antwerp]], following the [[Belgian local elections, 2012|2012 municipal elections]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Mortsel]], De Wever attended the ''[[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]]'' (KUL), graduating with a [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] (equivalent of the [[Master of Arts|master's degree]]) in History. As a student he was a member of the ''Liberaal Vlaams Studentenverbond'' ([[LVSV]], Liberal Flemish Students' Union), the ''Katholiek Vlaams Hoogstudentenverbond'' (KVHV, Catholic Flemish Students' Union) of Antwerp and [[Leuven]]. He is a former editor-in-chief of the KVHV newspapers ''Tegenstroom'' (magazine of KVHV in Antwerp) and ''Ons Leven'' (in Leuven).

He was employed as a research assistant working on the ''Nieuwe Encyclopedie van de Vlaamse Beweging'' (New Encyclopedia of the Flemish Movement). In 2004, he was elected as party leader of the N-VA with 95% of the votes, being the only candidate up for election.

De Wever went through a rough stretch in 2006 when he accepted the conservative-liberal{{clarify|reason=tautology?|date=August 2013}} [[Jean-Marie Dedecker]] as an N-VA member, causing a split with the [[Christian Democratic and Flemish|CD&amp;V party]]. In order to reconcile the party, Dedecker had to leave. Although he was extensively criticised, the local N-VA leaders permitted De Wever to remain as N-VA president.

In the [[Belgian regional elections, 2009|2009 regional elections]], his party won an unexpectedly high 13% of the votes, making N-VA the overall winner of the elections together with old cartel partner CD&amp;V. N-VA subsequently joined the government,{{clarify|reason=regional or national government?|date=August 2013}} with De Wever choosing to remain party president and appointing two other party members as ministers in the [[Flemish Government]] and one party member as speaker of the [[Flemish Parliament]].

Under his presidency his party gained around 30% of the votes in Flanders during [[Belgian federal election, 2010|federal elections]] held on June 13, 2010. De Wever himself won the most [[preference votes]] of the Dutch-speaking region (nearly 800,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/bart-de-wever-behaalde-785-776-voorkeurstemmen/article-normal-9037.html|title=Bart De Wever behaalde 785.776 voorkeurstemmen|newspaper=Knack|language=Dutch|access-date= 4 August 2017|date= 14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20100613_083|title=De Wever ook koning van de voorkeurstemmen|newspaper=Het Nieuwsblad|language=Dutch|access-date= 4 August 2017|date= 13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010 Belgian Federal Election==
{{main|2007–11 Belgian political crisis}}

An [[Belgian federal election, 2010|early election]] was held on 13 June 2010, resulting in the N-VA winning most votes in the Dutch-speaking areas and the [[Parti Socialiste (Belgium)|Socialist Party]] (PS) in French-speaking Belgium. Nationally the two parties were almost even with 27 seats for the N-VA and 26 for the PS, the remaining seats being split between ten other parties. For 541 days after the elections, no agreement could be reached among the parties on a coalition to form a new government and during that period the country continued to be governed by an interim government. On 6 December 2011 the [[Di Rupo I Government]] was sworn in.&lt;ref name="DiRupo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/news/111206_oath |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20111207192549/http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/news/111206_oath |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 December 2011 |title=New government sworn in at Laken Castle |publisher=FlandersNews.be |date=6 December 2011 |accessdate=6 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; De Wever and the N-VA were not included in the makeup of this government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15978423 Belgium close to governing coalition after 18-month gap], BBC News, December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the May 25, 2014 federal election, PS party leader [[Elio Di Rupo]] noted that his party will be unwilling to enter into a dialogue with De Wever and the N-VA regarding forming a new federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20140512_01102287 In Europe, we are one of the top countries], ''[[De Standaard]]'', May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
[[File:Herman Van Rompuy at the Belgian Chamber of Representatives - 20081205.jpg|thumb|Former Prime Minister of Belgium [[Herman Van Rompuy]] in the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives]] at the launch of Bart De Wever's book ''Het kostbare weefsel'' ("the precious fabric [of society]") in 2008.]]

In 1996, he was photographed attending a conference held by the French extreme-right ''[[National Front (France)|Front National]]'' leader [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Gilissen, ''[http://www.lalibre.be/index.php?view=article&amp;art_id=367438 La photo qui énerve Bart de Wever]'', Le Soir, 31 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; De Wever justified his attendance by arguing that "in a democracy everyone should have the right to express his opinion, even if it's an opinion I detest. And I always prefer to get my information first hand than to get it in a filtered way."

In October 2007, in reaction to the apology of the Mayor of Antwerp for his city's collaboration in the deportation of Jews during [[World War II]], Bart De Wever said that:
:"[[Antwerp]] did not organise the deportation of the Jews, it was the victim of Nazi occupation ... Those who were in power at the time had to take tricky decisions in difficult times. I don't find it very courageous to stigmatise them now."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/certainideasofeurope/2007/10/mentioning_the_war.cfm A Belgian leader flirts with the far-right], blog post by 'Charlemagne', 31 October 2007, hosted by ''The Economist.''&lt;/ref&gt;
He later issued an apology to representatives of Antwerp's Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejpress.org/article/21323 Flemish nationalist politician apologizes to Antwerp Jews] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101035528/http://www.ejpress.org/article/21323 |date=November 1, 2007 }}, ''European Jewish Press'', October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Following these events, in an op-ed published in ''[[Le Monde]]'', the Belgian French-speaking writer [[Pierre Mertens]] claimed that Bart De Wever was a "convinced [[holocaust denial|negationist]] leader". De Wever sued Mertens for this allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelid=DMF08072008_012 Le Soir daagt De Wever uit], ''De Standaard'', 8 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(fr) [http://www.dhnet.be/infos/monde/article/214293/bart-de-wever-attaque-le-monde.html ''Bart de Wever'' attaque Pierre Mertens], La Dernière Heure, 8 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, he called [[Angela Merkel]] personally responsible for the "mess she, herself has created" in relation to the [[Terrorism in Germany|2016 terrorist attacks in Germany]]. On the radio channel [[Radio 1 (Belgium)|Radio 1]], he 
claimed that [[Angela Merkel]] should have led a European military coalition against [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS/ISIL]] in 2015, that she was not a true leader, and insinuated that she could have partially prevented the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.demorgen.be/buitenland/de-wever-merkel-heeft-deze-puinhoop-zelf-veroorzaakt-bfc7db68/|title=De Wever: "Merkel heeft deze puinhoop zelf veroorzaakt".

==Death threats and illness==

In December 2013, the Belgian newspaper ''[[Het Laatste Nieuws]]'' received a bullet in the post with a letter addressed to Bart De Wever, apparently from a communist extremist. De Wever received police protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Torfs |url=http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/News/1.1797510 |title=Het Laatste Nieuws receives bullet for Bart De Wever |publisher=Deredactie.be |date= |accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, De Wever was admitted to hospital with severe anxiety and chest pains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Torfs |url=http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/News/1.1783746 |title=Bart De Wever hospitalised |publisher=Deredactie.be |date=2013-11-21 |accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was readmitted into an intensive care unit in February 2014 with a severe lung infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/5036/Wetstraat/article/detail/1792939/2014/02/13/Bart-De-Wever-ligt-opnieuw-in-het-ziekenhuis.dhtml |title=Bart De Wever ligt opnieuw in het ziekenhuis |publisher=Demorgen.be |date=2014-02-13 |accessdate=2014-07-09|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Panda suits==
In March 2014, Bart De Wever made a live appearance at the Flemish television awards, dressed in a [[Giant panda|Panda]] suit; a reference to a decision by the Di Rupo government to import two pandas ({{ill|Hao Hao en Xing Hui|nl}}) at a cost per panda greater than the legal maximum director's salary in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nieuws.vtm.be/tv-media/83780-panda-de-wever-valt-van-podium |title=Panda De Wever valt van podium &amp;#124; VTM NIEUWS |publisher=Nieuws.vtm.be |date=2014-03-15 |accessdate=2014-07-09|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anja Otte |url=http://www.flanderstoday.eu/politics/fifth-column-bring-pandas |title=Fifth column: Bring in the pandas &amp;#124; Flanders Today |publisher=Flanderstoday.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, because those pandas are initially gifts from the People's Republic of China, Di Rupo thought of it as impolite to refuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Belga|title="Le prêt des pandas à Pairi Daiza : un coût de 10 millions"|url=http://www.lesoir.be/474545/article/actualite/belgique/2014-02-21/pret-des-pandas-pairi-daiza-un-cout-10-millions|accessdate=29 July 2014|publisher=Le soir|date=21 February 2014|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Roncevaux Pass''' was a battle in which a combined [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basque]]-[[Banu Qasi|Qasawi]] [[Al-Andalus|Muslim]] army defeated a [[Carolingian]] military expedition in 824. The battle took place only 46 years after the first [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (778)]] in a confrontation showing similar features: a Basque force engaging from the mountains a northbound expedition led by the [[Francia#Carolingian empire, 751–840|Franks]], and the same geographical setting (the [[Roncevaux Pass]] or a spot nearby).

&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;The battle resulted in the defeat of the Carolingian military expedition and the capture of its commanders Aeblus and [[Aznar Sánchez]] in 824. The clash was to have further reaching consequences than those of the 778 engagement: the immediate establishment of the independent [[Kingdom of Pamplona]]. 

==Background== 
After [[Louis the Pious]]' half-hearted expedition to Pamplona circa 814, [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basque]] tribal chieftain [[Íñigo Arista of Pamplona|Enneko Aritza]], who held strong family ties with the [[Banu Qasi]] led by his half-brother [[Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi|Musa]], prevailed in the fortress circa 816 (or earlier) after news of Charlemagne's death (814) spread and a Frankish vassal, Belasko of Pamplona&amp;mdash; ''Velasco'', cited as ''Balashk al-Yalashki'' in Muslim sources&amp;mdash;was defeated in the [[Battle of Pancorbo (816)|Battle of Pancorbo]]. In 816, the revolt in Pamplona extended north across the Pyrenees, and in 816 Louis the Pious deposed [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (Sihimin) Duke of Vasconia]] and count of Bordeaux, who had been created duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]] in 812, for failing to suppress or sympathising with the rebellion, triggering a widespread revolt. 

The Basque lords on both sides of the Pyrenees rebelled, but were soon subdued in [[Arrondissement of Dax|Dax]] by Louis (817). Lupus Centullo was then appointed duke (818), but was immediately deposed after he rebelled. Meanwhile, in Aragon (Jaca) the pro-Frankish count Aznar Galindez was overthrown by Enneko´s allied count Garcia Malo (Garcia, 'the young' in old Basque) in 820. All Vasconia remained at this point in a shaky state of rebellion and the Frankish tenure on the [[Hispanic Marches]] was shifting out of control.

==The battle==
[[File:Urkuluko_Dorrea.JPG|thumb|Roman watchtower of Urkulu next to the Roncevaux Pass]]
In 824 an expedition was mustered by the Carolingian king in the Vasconia remaining under Frankish overlordship (north of the Pyrenees). The military force was headed by the Duke of Vasconia Aznar Sanchez, who led Basque troops hailing from current [[Gascony]], and count Aeblus ("''Aeblus et Asinarius comites cum copiis Wasconum ad Pampilonam missi''"), commanding a Frankish army. The military force headed south with a view to quashing the Basque rebellion centred in [[Pamplona#Early Middle Ages|Pamplona]]. The expedition arrived in the Basque stronghold, but encountered no resistance, and with the expedition having accomplished their goals, made their way back north with goods looted from the town. 

However, on the sinuous narrow passes of the region of [[Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port|Cize]] (according to Umayyad chroniclers), a joint force of Navarrese (Enneko Aritza), Aragonese and Banu Qasi warriors awaited them hidden in the forests. The Basques engaged the two columns in their terrain. The Carolingian forces were routed, and the two commanders of the expedition were captured.

==Aftermath==     
[[File:Ekialderantz_Urkulutik.JPG|thumb|The [[Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port|Cize]] mountain passes]]
While the Frankish count Aeblus was sent prisoner to [[Emirate of Córdoba|Córdoba]], [[Aznar Sánchez]] was released thanks to his kinship with the captors ("''Asinarius vero misericordia eorum, qui eum ceperant, quasi qui consanguineus eorum esset''") a fact that evidenced the good relations entertained at that moment by the joint Banu Qasi - Arista tandem with the Cordovan Umayyad, maybe after the accession to the throne of [[Abd ar-Rahman II]] in 822.

[[Íñigo Arista of Pamplona|Enneko Aritza]] emerged victorious after the battle and became the undisputed ruler of Pamplona. The new independent Basque kingdom brought about the definite detachment of the territories south of the Pyrenées from the [[Duchy of Vasconia]] suzerain to the Franks, as well as the loss of control over the Hispanic Marches for them and the start of an on-off alliance between the kings of Pamplona and the [[muwallad]] Banu Qasi.

[[File:Beatbeatbeat.jpg|thumb|''Beat, Beat, Beat'' (1959) by [[William F. Brown (writer)|William F. Brown]]]]
'''Beatnik''' was a [[Mass media|media]] [[stereotype]] prevalent throughout the 1950s to mid-1960s that displayed the more superficial aspects of the [[Beat Generation]] literary movement of the 1950s. Elements of the beatnik [[Trope (literature)|trope]] included pseudo-intellectualism, drug use, and a cartoonish depiction of real-life people along with the spiritual quest of [[Jack Kerouac]]'s [[Biography in literature|autobiographical fiction]].

==History==
[[File:BeatGenerationLOC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Poster for ''[[:en:The Beat Generation|The Beat Generation]]'' (1959)]]
In 1948, Kerouac introduced the phrase "Beat Generation", generalizing from his social circle to characterize the underground, anticonformist youth gathering in [[New York City|New York]] at that time. The name came up in conversation with [[John Clellon Holmes]], who published an early Beat Generation novel titled ''[[Go (Holmes novel)|Go]]'' (1952), along with the manifesto ''This Is the Beat Generation'' in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.litkicks.com/Texts/ThisIsBeatGen.html Holmes, John Clellon. "This Is the Beat Generation," ''The New York Times'', November 16, 1952.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122040720/http://www.litkicks.com/Texts/ThisIsBeatGen.html |date=November 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, [[Nolan Miller (author)|Nolan Miller]] published his third novel ''Why I Am So Beat'' (Putnam), detailing the weekend parties of four students.

The adjective "beat" was introduced to the group by [[Herbert Huncke]], though Kerouac expanded the meaning of the term.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} "Beat" came from underworld slang—the world of hustlers, drug addicts and petty thieves, where [[Allen Ginsberg]] and Kerouac sought inspiration. "Beat" was slang for "beaten down" or downtrodden, but to Kerouac and Ginsberg, it also had a spiritual connotation as in "[[beatitude]]." Other adjectives discussed by Holmes and Kerouac were "found" and "furtive." Kerouac felt he had identified (and was the embodiment of) a new trend analogous to the influential [[Lost Generation]].&lt;ref&gt;Kerouac, Jack. ''The Portable Kerouac''. Ed. [[Ann Charters]]. Penguin Classics, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hol"&gt;Holmes, John Clellon. ''Passionate Opinions: The Cultural Essays (Selected Essays By John Clellon Holmes, Vol 3)''. University of Arkansas Press, 1988. {{ISBN|1-55728-049-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Aftermath: The Philosophy of the Beat Generation," Kerouac criticized what he saw as a distortion of his visionary, spiritual ideas:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Beat Generation, that was a vision that we had, John Clellon Holmes and I, and Allen Ginsberg in an even wilder way, in the late Forties, of a generation of crazy, illuminated [[hipster (1940s subculture)|hipsters]] suddenly rising and roaming America, serious, bumming and hitchhiking everywhere, ragged, beatific, beautiful in an ugly graceful new way—a vision gleaned from the way we had heard the word "beat" spoken on street corners on Times Square and in the Village, in other cities in the downtown city night of postwar America—beat, meaning down and out but full of intense conviction. We'd even heard old 1910 Daddy Hipsters of the streets speak the word that way, with a melancholy sneer. It never meant juvenile delinquents, it meant characters of a special spirituality who didn't gang up but were solitary [[Bartleby, the Scrivener|Bartlebies]] staring out the dead wall window of our civilization ...&lt;ref&gt;[http://terebess.hu/english/kerouac.html Kerouac, Jack. "About the Beat Generation," (1957), published as "Aftermath: The Philosophy of the Beat Generation" in ''Esquire,'' March 1958] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722025344/http://terebess.hu/english/kerouac.html |date=2009-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG00/lambert/ontheroad/response.html Reviews: ''On the Road''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629214314/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG00/lambert/ontheroad/response.html |date=2010-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kerouac explained what he meant by "beat" at a Brandeis Forum, "Is There A Beat Generation?", on November 8, 1958 at New York's Hunter College Playhouse. The seminar's panelists were Kerouac, James A. Wechsler, Princeton [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Ashley Montagu]] and author [[Kingsley Amis]]. Wechsler, Montagu, and Amis wore suits, while Kerouac was clad in black jeans, ankle boots and a checkered shirt. Reading from a prepared text, Kerouac reflected on his beat beginnings:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is because I am Beat, that is, I believe in beatitude and that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son to it ... Who knows, but that the universe is not one vast sea of compassion actually, the veritable holy honey, beneath all this show of personality and cruelty?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blacklistedjournalist.com/column22.html Aronowitz, Al. ''The Blacklisted Journalist''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102070709/http://blacklistedjournalist.com/column22.html |date=2011-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kerouac's statement was later published as "The Origins of the Beat Generation" (''Playboy'', June 1959). In that article, Kerouac noted how his original beatific philosophy had been ignored amid maneuvers by several pundits, among them San Francisco newspaper columnist [[Herb Caen]], to alter Kerouac's concept with jokes and jargon:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I went one afternoon to the church of my childhood and had a vision of what I must have really meant with "Beat"... the vision of the word Beat as being to mean beatific ... People began to call themselves beatniks, beats, jazzniks, bopniks, bugniks, and finally I was called the "avatar" of all this.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In light of what he considered ''beat'' to mean and what ''beatnik'' had come to mean, Kerouac once observed to a reporter, "I'm not a beatnik, I'm a Catholic", showing the reporter a painting of [[Pope Paul VI]] and saying, "You know who painted that? Me."

==Stereotype==
[[File:Beatgirl (3).jpg|right|thumb|90px|Stereotypical beatnik woman.]]
In her memoir, ''Minor Characters'', [[Joyce Johnson]] described how the stereotype was absorbed into American culture:

{{quote|Beat Generation" sold books, sold black turtleneck sweaters and bongos, berets and dark glasses, sold a way of life that seemed like dangerous fun—thus to be either condemned or imitated. Suburban couples could have beatnik parties on Saturday nights and drink too much and fondle each other's wives.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Joyce. ''Minor Characters'', Houghton Mifflin, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kerouac biographer [[Ann Charters]] noted that the term "Beat" was [[Cultural appropriation|appropriated]] to become a Madison Avenue marketing tool:

{{quote|The term caught on because it could mean anything. It could even be exploited in the affluent wake of the decade's extraordinary technological inventions. Almost immediately, for example, advertisements by "hip" record companies in New York used the idea of the Beat Generation to sell their new long playing [[Gramophone record|vinyl records]].&lt;ref&gt;Charters, Ann. ''Beat Down to Your Soul: What Was the Beat Generation?'' Penguin, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lee Streiff, an acquaintance of many members of the movement who went on to become one of its chroniclers, believed that the news media saddled the movement for the long term with a set of false images:

{{quote|Reporters are not generally well versed in artistic movements, or the history of literature or art. And most are certain that their readers, or viewers, are of limited intellectual ability and must have things explained simply, in any case. Thus, the reporters in the media tried to relate something that was new to already preexisting frameworks and images that were only vaguely appropriate in their efforts to explain and simplify. With a variety of oversimplified and conventional formulas at their disposal, they fell back on the nearest stereotypical approximation of what the phenomenon resembled, as they saw it. And even worse, they did not see it clearly and completely at that. They got a quotation here and a photograph there — and it was their job to wrap it up in a comprehensible package — and if it seemed to violate the prevailing mandatory conformist doctrine, they would also be obliged to give it a negative spin as well. And in this, they were aided and abetted by the Poetic Establishment of the day. Thus, what came out in the media: from newspapers, magazines, TV, and the movies, was a product of the stereotypes of the 30s and 40s — though garbled — of a cross between a 1920s Greenwich Village bohemian artist and a Bop musician, whose visual image was completed by mixing in Daliesque paintings, a beret, a [[Van dyke beard|Vandyck beard]], a turtleneck sweater, a pair of sandals, and set of bongo drums. A few authentic elements were added to the collective image: poets reading their poems, for example, but even this was made unintelligible by making all of the poets speak in some kind of phony Bop idiom. The consequence is, that even though we may know now that these images do not accurately reflect the reality of the Beat movement, we still subconsciously look for them when we look back to the 50s. We have not even yet completely escaped the visual imagery that has been so insistently forced upon us.&lt;ref&gt;Streiff, Thornton Lee.

==Etymology==
[[Image:Thebeatniks.jpg|right|thumb|Poster for ''The Beatniks'' (1960)]]
The word "beatnik" was coined by [[Herb Caen]] in his column in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' on April 2, 1958. Caen wrote "Look magazine, preparing a picture spread on S.F.'s Beat Generation (oh, no, not AGAIN!), hosted a party in a No. Beach house for 50 Beatniks, and by the time word got around the sour grapevine, over 250 bearded cats and kits were on hand, slopping up Mike Cowles' free booze. They're only Beat, y'know, when it comes to work . . ."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1997/02/06/MN18715.DTL Caen, Herb. ''San Francisco Chronicle'', April 2, 1958.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128190058/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F1997%2F02%2F06%2FMN18715.DTL |date=January 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Caen coined the term by adding the [[Russian language|Russian]] suffix ''[[-nik]]'' to the Beat Generation.

Caen's column with the word came six months after the launch of ''[[Sputnik I]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/HOW-HERB-CAEN-NAMED-A-GENERATION-3018725.php |title=How Herb Caen Named a Generation |date=November 26, 1995 |last=Hamlin |first=Jesse |work=San Francisco Chronicle |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808044256/http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/HOW-HERB-CAEN-NAMED-A-GENERATION-3018725.php |archivedate=August 8, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZhgFUyCOhHcC&amp;pg=PA251 |page=251 |title=Sputnik: The Shock of the Century |last=Dickson |first=Paul |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2009 |isbn=9780802718044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objecting to the term, Allen Ginsberg wrote to the ''New York Times'' to deplore "the foul word beatnik", commenting, "If beatniks and not illuminated Beat poets overrun this country, they will have been created not by Kerouac but by industries of mass communication which continue to brainwash man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=If4g5TkKQoQC&amp;pg=PT227&amp;lpg=PT227|title=The Letters of Allen Ginsberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beat culture==
In the vernacular of the period, "Beat" referred to Beat culture, attitude and literature; while "beatnik" referred to a stereotype found in cartoon drawings and twisted, sometimes violent media characters. In 1995, film scholar [[Ray Carney]] wrote about the authentic beat attitude as differentiated from stereotypical media portrayals of the beatnik:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Much of Beat culture represented a negative stance rather than a positive one. It was animated more by a vague feeling of cultural and emotional displacement, dissatisfaction, and yearning, than by a specific purpose or program ... It was many different, conflicting, shifting states of mind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/Carney.html Carney, Ray. "Program Notes," ''Beat Culture and the New America: 1950-1965''. New York: Whitney Museum of Art and Paris: Flammarion, 1995.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906034632/http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/Carney.html |date=2006-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:MissBeatnik.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The news photo caption for this 1959 event in [[Venice, California]] read: "Beatnik Beauties: Posing before a sample of beatnik art are contestants for the title of Miss Beatnik of 1959, which will be conferred Sept. 12 under sponsorship of the Venice Arts Committee. From left are Michi Monteef, Sammy McCord, Patti McCrory, Shaunna Lea and, in rear, Jan Vandaveer."&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', August 27, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Since 1958, the terms Beat Generation and Beat have been used to describe the [[Economic materialism|antimaterialistic]] literary movement that began with Kerouac in the 1940s and continued into the 1960s. The Beat philosophy of antimaterialism and soul searching influenced 1960s musicians such as [[Bob Dylan]], the early [[Pink Floyd]] and [[The Beatles]].

However, the soundtrack of the beat movement was the modern jazz pioneered by saxophonist [[Charlie Parker]] and trumpeter [[Dizzy Gillespie]], which the media dubbed [[bebop]].  Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg spent much of their time in New York jazz clubs such as the [[Royal Roost]], [[Minton's Playhouse]], [[Birdland (jazz club)|Birdland]] and the Open Door, shooting the breeze and digging the music. Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and [[Miles Davis]] rapidly became what Ginsberg dubbed "secret heroes" to this group of aesthetes. The Beat authors borrowed much from the jazz/hipster slang of the 1940s, peppering their works with words such as "square", "cats", "cool" and "dig".

At the time the term "beatnik" was coined, a trend existed among young college students to adopt the stereotype. Men emulated the trademark look of bebop trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie by wearing [[goatee]]s, [[horn-rimmed glasses]] and [[beret]]s, rolling their own cigarettes, and playing [[Bongo drum|bongos]]. Fashions for women included black [[leotard]]s and long, straight, unadorned hair, in a rebellion against the middle-class culture of beauty salons. [[cannabis (drug)|Marijuana]] use was associated with the subculture, and during the 1950s, [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' further influenced views on drugs.

By 1960, a small "beatnik" group in [[Newquay]], Cornwall, England (including a young [[Wizz Jones]]) had attracted the attention and abhorrence of their neighbours for growing their hair beyond shoulder length, resulting in a television interview with [[Alan Whicker]] on BBC television's ''[[Tonight (1957 TV series)|Tonight]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3WfXA9JL9w Whicker, Alan. ''Tonight'': "Beatniks in Newquay". BBC, 1960.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118103552/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3WfXA9JL9w |date=2015-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beat philosophy was generally countercultural and antimaterialistic, and stressed the importance of bettering one's inner self over material possessions. Some Beat writers, such as [[Alan Watts]], began to delve into Eastern religions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]]. Politics tended to be [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]], left-wing and anti-war, with support for causes such as [[desegregation]] (although many of the figures associated with the original Beat movement, particularly Kerouac, embraced [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[conservative]] ideas). An openness to [[African American culture]] and arts was apparent in literature and music, notably jazz. While Caen and other writers implied a connection with communism, no obvious or direct connection occurred between Beat philosophy, as expressed by the literary movement's leading authors, and that of the [[Communist|communist movement]], other than the antipathy both philosophies shared towards capitalism. Those with only a superficial familiarity with the Beat movement often saw this similarity and assumed the two movements had more in common.

The Beat movement introduced Asian religions to Western society.  These religions provided the Beat generation with new views of the world and corresponded with its desire to rebel against conservative middle-class values of the 1950s, old post-1930s radicalism, mainstream culture, and institutional religions in America.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;Carl Jackson. "The Counterculture Looks East: Beat Writers and Asian religion". ''American Studies'', Vol. 29, No. 1 (spring 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1958, many Beat writers published writings on Buddhism. This was the year Jack Kerouac published his novel ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'', whose central character (whom Kerouac based on himself) sought Buddhist contexts for events in his life.

Allen Ginsberg's spiritual journey to India in 1963 also influenced the Beat movement. After studying religious texts alongside monks, Ginsburg deduced that what linked the function of poetry to Asian religions was their mutual goal of achieving ultimate truth. His discovery of Hindu [[mantra]] chants, a form of oral delivery, subsequently influenced Beat poetry. Beat pioneers who followed a Buddhism-influenced spiritual path appreciated Asian religions's profound understanding of human nature and insights into the being, existence and reality of mankind.&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt; Many of the Beat advocates believed that the core concepts of Asia religious philosophies had the means of elevating American society's consciousness, and these concepts informed their main ideologies.&lt;ref name="Chand"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable Beat writers such as Kerouac, Ginsberg, and [[Gary Snyder]] were drawn to Buddhism to the extent that they each, at different periods in their lives, followed a spiritual path in their quests to provide answers to universal questions and concepts. As a result, the Beat philosophy stressed the bettering of the inner self and the rejection of [[Economic materialism|materialism]], and postulated that East Asian religions could fill a religious and spiritual void in the lives of many Americans.&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt;

Many scholars speculate that Beat writers wrote about Eastern religions to encourage young people to practice spiritual and sociopolitical action. Progressive concepts from these religions, particularly those regarding personal freedom, influenced youth culture to challenge capitalist domination, break their generation's dogmas, and reject traditional gender and racial rules.&lt;ref name=Chand/&gt;

==Beatniks in media==
Possibly the first movie portrayal of the Beat society was in the 1949 film ''[[D.O.A. (1950 film)|D.O.A]]'', directed by [[Rudolph Maté]]. In the film the main character goes to a loud San Francisco bar, where one woman shouts to the musicians: "Cool! Cool! Really cool!"  One of the characters says, "Man, am I really hip", and another replies, "You're from nowhere, nowhere!".  Lone dancers are seen moving to the beat. Some are dressed with accessories and have hairstyles that one would expect to see in much later films. Typical 1940s attire is mixed with beatnik clothing styles, particularly in one male who has a beatnik hat, long hair, and a mustache and goatee, but is still wearing a dress suit. The bartender refers to a patron as "Jive Crazy" and talks of the music driving its followers crazy. He then tells one man to "Calm down Jack!" and the man replies, "Oh don't bother me, man. I'm being enlightened!".  The scene also demonstrates the connection to and influence of 1940s genres of African American music such as [[Bebop]] on the emergence of Beat culture.  The featured band "Jive" is all-black, while the customers who express their appreciation for the music in a jargon that would come to characterize the stereotype of Beat culture are young white hipsters.

The 1953 [[Dalton Trumbo]] movie ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' starring [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[Gregory Peck]] features a supporting character played by [[Eddie Albert]] that is a stereotypical beatnik, appearing five years before the term was coined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leagueofdeadfilms.com/2014/01/20/roman-holiday/|title=January 20th, 2014:  Roman Holiday (1953)|author=|date=20 January 2014|website=leagueofdeadfilms.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428165736/https://leagueofdeadfilms.com/2014/01/20/roman-holiday/|archivedate=28 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has an Eastern European surname, Radovich, and is a promiscuous photographer who wears baggy clothes, a striped T-shirt and a beard, which is mentioned four times in the screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/r/roman-holiday-script-transcript.html|title=Roman Holiday Script - Screenplay from the Audrey Hepburn movie|author=|date=|website=www.script-o-rama.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020182251/http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/r/roman-holiday-script-transcript.html|archivedate=20 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley Donen]] brought the theme to the film musical in ''[[Funny Face]]'' (1957) with one [[Audrey Hepburn]] production number revamped into a [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap]] commercial in 2006. One of [[Jerry Yulsman]]'s photographs of Kerouac was [[Photo manipulation|altered]] for use in a Gap print ad, in which Joyce Johnson was omitted from the image.

Another film involving beatnik culture is [[Roger Corman]]'s 1959 black comedy "[[A Bucket of Blood]]," written by [[Charles B. Griffith]].  In the film, a coffee house busboy longs for acceptance by the beatnik patrons, so he develops a style of sculpture using dead animals and people. An influential character in the film is the beatnik poet, who convinces the group to accept the busboy as a significant artist. Indicating his acceptance into the group, an adoring female fan surreptitiously gives the artist a vial of heroin, implying that drug use was an accepted, and perhaps required, part of beatnik culture. The film's soundtrack is cool, horn-based jazz.  There is also a performance by a singer with an acoustic guitar.  Rock &amp; roll music is absent, despite its popularity and counter-cultural aspect.  One possibility is that the upbeat feel of rock &amp; roll music was at odds with the detached, low-key, nihilistic attitude of the beat society.

The character [[Maynard G. Krebs]], played on TV by [[Bob Denver]] in ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]'' (1959–63), solidified the stereotype of the indolent non-conformist beatnik, which contrasted with the aggressively rebellious Beat-related images presented by popular film actors of the early and mid-1950s, notably [[Marlon Brando]] and [[James Dean]].

[[Image:Nervousset.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Jules Feiffer]]'s ad art for the Beat musical ''The Nervous Set'' was used on the 1959 cast album (reissued in 2002).]]
The subculture surfaced on Broadway as musical comedy in ''The Nervous Set'' (1959) by ''Neurotica'' editor [[Jay Landesman]] and [[Theodore J. Flicker]] with music by Tommy Wolf and lyrics by [[Fran Landesman]]; this was the source of two jazz standards, "[[Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most]]" and "The Ballad of the Sad Young Men" (recorded by [[Gil Evans]], Anita O'Day, [[Mark Murphy (singer)]], Roberta Flack, Petula Clark, Rod McKuen, Shirley Bassey and others). The show opened with the song, "Man, We're Beat".

''[[The Beat Generation]]'' ([[1959 in film|1959]]) made an association of the movement with crime and violence, as did ''[[The Beatniks (film)|The Beatniks]]'' (1960). The notion of violence or other criminality possibly arose because hardcore outlaws and criminals were popularly portrayed as using many of the same jive terms in their speech, and this distortion could also be seen in popular TV shows with regard to the contemporary [[greaser (subculture)|greasers]] as well as the [[hippies]] a few years later.

The 1960 [[Jerry Lewis]] film ''[[Visit to a Small Planet]]'', based on a satirical [[Gore Vidal]] play, features Lewis as an alien who entrances beatniks at a nightclub ("we don't use floors ... we use fog") and who appears to understand a [[Scat singing|scat]] song as being in an intelligible language.

The film ''[[The Rebel (1961 film)|The Rebel]]'' (US: ''Call Me Genius'', 1961) featuring British comedian [[Tony Hancock]]'s tells of a London office clerk who moves to Paris to pursue his vocation as an artist of the Beat Generation; the film satirizes pseudointellectuals.

''Two for the Seesaw'' was a successful [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play by [[William Gibson (playwright)|William Gibson]] and was made into a [[Two for the Seesaw|1962 film]] which portrayed the fated romance between a small town square (Jerry) and [[Greenwich Village]] beatnik chick (Gittel). Jerry is perplexed by what he perceives as Gittel's chaotic and promiscuous lifestyle and goes back to his wife in hicksville.

The ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoon character [[List of Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies characters#Cool Cat|Cool Cat]] is often portrayed as a beatnik, as is the banty rooster in the 1963 [[Foghorn Leghorn]] short ''Banty Raids''. Similarly, the ''[[Beany and Cecil]]'' cartoon series also had a beatnik character, Go Man Van Gogh (aka "The Wildman"), who often lives in the jungle and paints various pictures and backgrounds to fool his enemies, first appearing in the episode, "The Wildman of Wildsville." [[Hanna Barbera]]'s series ''[[Top Cat]]'' features Spook, a beatnik cat; and their series ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', features a beatnik character Shaggy. In the animated series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', the parents of character [[Ned Flanders]] are beatniks.

In the animated television series ''[[Doug (TV series)|Doug]]'', Doug's older sister, Judy Funnie, is characterized as a beatnik.

Two beatniks (played by [[Ric Ocasek]] and [[Pia Zadora]]) painted furiously and played bongos in [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]' 1988 ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]''.

Beat coffeehouses are depicted in ''[[So I Married an Axe Murderer]]'' (1993), "[[American Pop]]" (1981), ''[[Take Her, She's Mine]]'' (1964), ''[[The Flower Drum Song]]'' (1961), ''[[The Hudsucker Proxy]]'' (1994) and episode six, "Babylon", of ''[[Mad Men]]''.

The long-running [[midnight movie]] series ''[[Off Beat Cinema]]'', which debuted in 1993, is hosted by a trio of coffee-drinking beatniks.

In the 1999 animated film ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' the character Dean McCoppin (voiced by [[Harry Connick Jr.]]) is portrayed as a beatnik, whose passion is turning discarded items in his junkyard into sculptures.

In the ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' episode "Buttniks," the two giggling, slacker teens find themselves in a beatnik coffee house where Beavis gets buzzed on cappuccinos.

In the ''[[Girl Meets World]]'' episode "Girl Meets 1961" four of the main characters discover their ancestors attended a beatnik café in [[Greenwich Village]] named [[Cafe Wha?|Café Hey]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6507">'''Boris Mikhailovich Eikhenbaum'''&lt;ref&gt;Also [[Romanization of Russian|transliterated]] '''Eichenbaum'''.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-rus|Борис Михайлович Эйхенбаум|p=ɨjxʲɪnˈbaʊm}}; October 16, 1886 – November 2, 1959) was a Russian and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] literary scholar and historian of [[Russian literature]]. He is a representative of [[Russian formalism]].

== Biography ==
Eikhenbaum was born in [[Voronezh]], the grandson of [[Jew]]ish mathematician and poet [[Jacob Eichenbaum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Eichenbaum (Gelber), Jacob|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/eichenbaum-gelber-jacob|work=Encyclopaedia Judaica}}&lt;/ref&gt; His childhood and adolescence were spent there. After finishing elementary school in 1905, Eikhenbaum went to Petersburg and enrolled in the [[Soviet military academies#Kirov Military Medical Academy|Kirov Military Medical Academy]], soon thereafter in 1906, he enrolled in the biological faculty of the Free High School of [[Peter Lesgaft|P. F. Lesgaft]]. In parallel he studied music (violin, piano, voice). In 1907 Eikhenbaum left this school and enrolled in the Musical school of E. P. Raprof and the historical-philological faculty of [[Saint Petersburg State University]]. In 1909, Eikhenbaum abandoned professional aspirations in music, choosing in favor of [[philology]]. In this same year after two years of study in the Slavic-Russian department, Eikhenbaum transferred to the Romance-Germanic department; however, in 1911, he returned to the Slavic-Russian department. In 1912, Eikhenbaum finished his university studies. From 1913 to 1914, Eikhenbaum published in a number of periodicals, and conducted reviews of foreign literature in the newspaper «Русская молва». In 1914, Eikhenbaum began his pedagogical activities, and became a teacher in the school of Y. G. Gurevich.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Joyce Any, ''Boris Eikhenbaum: Voices of a Russian Formalist,'' Stanford University Press, 1994, pp. 11-16, {{ISBN|0-8047-2229-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Николай Мельников, [http://www.lechaim.ru/ARHIV/174/d2.htm ''Борис Эйхенбаум. Жизнь в слове''] Лехаим, Октябрь 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Электронная Еврейская Энциклопедия, [http://eleven.co.il/article/15034 ''Эйхенбаум Борис'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Энциклопедия Кругосвет, [http://www.krugosvet.ru/articles/72/1007284/1007284a1.htm ''Эйхенбаум, Борис Михайлович'']&lt;/ref&gt;

A key moment in the biography of Eikhenbaum was his involvement with other members of the Society for the Study of Poetic Language ([[OPOJAZ]]), which was formed in 1916. In 1918, Eikhenbaum joined OPOJAZ and participated in their research until the middle of the 1920s. Eikhenbaum provided definition and interpretation for the group,&lt;ref&gt;Victor Erlich, ''Russian Formalism: History, Doctrine,'' Walter de Gruyter, 1980, p. 66, {{ISBN|90-279-0450-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; with essays such as ''Theory of the "Formal Method"'' he helped outline their approach to literature.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Brooks et al., ''The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism,'' Cambridge University Press, 1995, v. 8. pp 11-14, {{ISBN|0-521-30013-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1947 to 1949, Eikhenbaum was victimized by the campaign against "[[rootless cosmopolitan]]ism,"&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Mclean, [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/18/books/two-decades-of-a-russian-giant.html ''Two Decades of a Russian Giant,''] The New York Times, April 18, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Any, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Viktor Zhirmunsky]], [[Grigorii Gukovskii]], and [[Mark Azadovsky]], but was able to continue his science. Eikhenbaum died at the age of 73 in Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, in 1959.

[[File:John Garstang Jul 1956.jpg|thumb|[[John Garstang|John B. E. Garstang]], founder of the institute and its first director.]]

The '''British Institute at Ankara''' (BIAA), formerly '''British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara''', is a research institute that supports, promotes, and publishes research into the humanities and social sciences of Turkey and the Black Sea region. The Institute was founded in 1947 and became legally incorporated in 1956 as part of a cultural agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the United Kingdom. The institute is a UK registered charity and part of the [[British Academy]]'s Overseas Institutes. The Institute has an office in London and has its base in [[Ankara]], where it maintains a library, research facilities, and accommodation for visiting scholars. &lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biaa.ac.uk/about-the-biaa |title=About the BIAA |publisher=BIAA |date=1947-11-22 |accessdate=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=313940 |title=Charity overview |publisher=Charity Commission |date= |accessdate=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arch.oucs.ox.ac.uk/detail/94706/index.html Archaeology page]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Archaeologist [[Lutgarde Vandeput]] is the current Director of the BIAA.

In addition to funding the publication of research monographs on archaeology and the history of Turkey, the institute regularly publishes the journal ''[[Anatolian Studies]]'' and the annual magazine ''[[Heritage Turkey]]''. 

By the decision of the Turkish government, all scholars from the United Kingdom wishing to do archeological research in Turkey must channel their permit applications through the British Institute in Ankara. &lt;ref&gt;Roger Mathews, ed., ''Ancient Anatolia, Fifty Years Work By the British Institute of Archeology at Ankara'', 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The BIAA was founded on 22 November 1947 after proposals by the British archaeologist [[John Garstang]], who became the Institute's first director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/arts-culture/2015/10/10/in-the-footsteps-of-a-pioneer-archaeologist |title=In the footsteps of a pioneer archaeologist |publisher=Daily Sabah |date= |accessdate=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was instrumental in choosing Ankara as the location of the new institute, in contrast to similar existing organizations that were based in [[Istanbul]]. The Institute's journal, Anatolian Studies, was first published in 1951, becoming a key reference for all archaeology-related disciplines in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/anatolian-studies |title=Anatolian Studies |publisher=Cambridge |date= |accessdate=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seton Lloyd]] succeeded Garstang as director in 1949, In 1961, [[Michael Gough (archaeologist)|Michael Gough]] became the institute's third director. He had a focus on the [[Byzantine period]], with excavations at the church complex at [[Alahan Monastery|Alahan]] and at [[Dağpazarı|Dağ Pazarı]]. [[James Mellaart]], as assistant director from 1957 to 1961, started excavations at the site of [[Çatalhöyük]], identifying it as a unique Neolithic settlement. [[David French (archaeologist)|David French]] became the institute's fourth director in 1968. In 1993 French retired and in 1995 [[Roger Matthews (archaeologist)|Roger Mathews]] became the 5th director. Hugh Elton, who was appointed as the director in 2001, changed the name of the British Institute of Archaeology to British Institute. The current director is Lutgarde Vandeput, who became director in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biaa.ac.uk/about-the-biaa British Institıte page]&lt;/ref&gt;
British archaeologist [[Shahina Farid]] is honorary secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://historicengland.org.uk/research/methods/archaeology/scientific-dating/ |title= Scientific Dating {{!}} Historic England |author= Historic England |website= historicengland.org.uk |date= 15 Feb 2017 |access-date= 2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chanel No. 5 Fragrance Austin Calhoon Photograph.jpg|thumb|Chanel No. 5 fragrance]]

'''Chanel No. 5''' was the first [[perfume]] launched by French [[Haute couture|couturier]] [[Coco Chanel|Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel]]. The chemical formula for the fragrance was compounded by French-Russian chemist and perfumer [[Ernest Beaux]]. The modern commercial product no longer contains all the original ingredients. The design of its bottle has been an important part of the product's allure. 

==Inspiration ==
Traditionally, fragrances worn by women fell into two basic categories: "respectable women" favored the essence of a single garden flower. Sexually provocative perfumes heavy with animal [[musk]] or [[jasmine]] were associated with women of the [[demi-monde]], [[prostitute]]s, or [[courtesans]].&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mazzeo |first1=Tilar J |title=The Secret of Chanel No. 5: The Biography of a Scent |date=2010 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |isbn=9780061791017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|20}} Chanel sought a new scent that would appeal to the [[flapper]] and celebrate the liberated spirit of the [[Roaring Twenties|1920s]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
{{peacock|date=August 2018}}

==The No. 5 name==
At the age of twelve, Chanel was handed over to the care of nuns, and for the next six years spent a stark, disciplined existence in a convent orphanage, [[Aubazine]], founded by 12th century [[Cistercians]]&lt;ref name=Vaughan-2011&gt;{{cite book |title= Sleeping with the Enemy: Coco Chanel's Secret War|last= Vaughan |first= Hal |year= 2011 |publisher= Knopf |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-307-59263-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|4}} in the [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] region of central [[France]]. From her earliest days there, the number five had potent associations for her. For Chanel, the number five was especially esteemed as signifying the pure embodiment of a thing, its spirit, its mystic meaning. The paths that led Chanel to the cathedral for daily prayers were laid out in circular patterns repeating the number five.&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|8–9}}

Her affinity for the number five co-mingled with the abbey gardens, and by extension the lush surrounding hillsides abounding with ''[[Cistus]]'' (rock roses).&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|10}}

In 1920, when presented with small glass vials containing sample scents numbered 1 to 5 and 20 to 24 for her assessment, she chose the fifth vial. Chanel told her master perfumer, Ernest Beaux, whom she had commissioned to develop a new fragrance, "I present my dress collections on the fifth of May, the fifth month of the year and so we will let this sample number five keep the name it has already, it will bring good luck."&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|60-61}}

==Bottle design==
Chanel envisioned a design that would be an antidote for the over-elaborate, precious fussiness of the crystal fragrance bottles then in fashion popularized by [[Lalique]] and [[Baccarat (company)|Baccarat]]. Her bottle would be "pure transparency&amp;nbsp;...an invisible bottle." It is generally considered that the bottle design was inspired by the rectangular beveled lines of the [[Charvet Place Vendôme|Charvet]] toiletry bottles, which, outfitted in a [[leather]] traveling case, were favored by her lover, [[Boy Capel|Arthur "Boy" Capel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bollon|first=Patrice|title=Esprit d'époque: essai sur l'âme contemporaine et le conformisme naturel de nos sociétés|page=57|language=French|isbn=978-2-02-013367-8|publisher=[[Éditions du Seuil|Le Seuil]]|year=2002|quote=L'adaptation d'un flacon d'eau de toilette pour hommes datant de l'avant-guerre du chemisier Charvet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some say it was the [[whiskey]] [[decanter]] he used that she admired and wished to reproduce in "exquisite, expensive, delicate glass."&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|103}}

The first bottle produced in 1919, differed from the Chanel No. 5 bottle known today. The original container had small, delicate, rounded shoulders and was sold only in Chanel boutiques to select clients. In 1924, when "Parfums Chanel" incorporated, the glass proved too thin to survive shipping and distribution. The bottle was modified with square, faceted corners, its only significant design change.&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|104}} In a 1924 marketing brochure, ''Parfums Chanel'' described the bottle as, "the perfection of the product forbids dressing it in the customary artifices. Why rely on the art of the glassmaker...Mademoiselle is proud to present simple bottles adorned only by...precious teardrops of perfume of incomparable quality, unique in composition, revealing the artistic personality of their creator."&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;

Unlike the bottle, which has remained the same since the 1924 redesign, the stopper has gone through numerous modifications. The original stopper was a small glass plug. The octagonal stopper, which became a brand signature, was created in 1924, when the bottle shape was changed. The 1950s gave the stopper a bevel cut and a larger, thicker silhouette. In the 1970s the stopper became even more prominent but, in 1986, it was re-proportioned so its size was more harmonious with the scale of the bottle.&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|105}}

The "pocket ''flaçon''", designed to be carried in a purse, was introduced in 1934. The price point and container size were reduced to appeal to a broader customer base.&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|121}}

The bottle, over the decades, has itself become an identifiable cultural artifact, so much so that [[Andy Warhol]] chose to commemorate its iconic status in the mid-1980s with his [[pop art]], silk-screened, ''Ads: Chanel''.&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|199}} 

A limited-edition, crimson red crystal glass bottle in the three editions of Chanel No. 5, ''Eau de Parfum'', ''Parfum'', and ''L'Eau'', is slated to be launched for Christmas 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Harper's Bazaar |title=The iconic Chanel N°5 is launching in a limited-edition red bottle |url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/fragrance/a23776019/chanel-no-5-red-bottle/ |accessdate=18 October 2018|date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Battle for control of Parfums Chanel==
In 1924, Chanel made an agreement with the Wertheimer brothers, [[Pierre Wertheimer|Pierre]] and Paul, directors of the eminent perfume house, [[Bourjois]], creating a new corporate entity, "''Parfums Chanel''". The Wertheimers agreed to manage production, marketing, and distribution of Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5. The Wertheimers would receive a 70 percent share of the company, and [[Théophile Bader]], founder of the Paris department store, [[Galeries Lafayette]], would receive 20 percent. Bader had been instrumental in brokering the business connection by introducing Chanel to Pierre Wertheimer at the [[Longchamp Racecourse|Longchamps]] races in 1922.&lt;ref name=DT&gt;Thomas, Dana, "The Power Behind The Cologne," ''The New York Times,'' 24 February 2002, retrieved 18 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; For 10 percent of the stock, Chanel licensed her name to ''Parfums Chanel'' and removed herself from involvement in all business operations.&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|95}} Later, unhappy with the arrangement, Chanel worked for more than twenty years to gain full control of ''Parfums Chanel''. She proclaimed that Pierre Wertheimer was "the bandit who screwed me".&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|153}} 

[[World War II]] brought with it the Nazi seizure of all Jewish-owned property and businesses, providing Chanel with the opportunity to gain control of ''Parfums Chanel'' and its most profitable product, Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5. The directors of ''Parfums Chanel'', the Wertheimers, were Jewish, and Chanel used her position as an "Aryan" to petition German officials to legalize her right to sole ownership.

On 5 May 1941, Chanel wrote to the government administrator charged with ruling on the disposition of Jewish financial assets. Her grounds for proprietary ownership were based on the claim that ''Parfums Chanel'' "is still the property of Jews" and had been legally "abandoned" by the owners.&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|150}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have, an indisputable right of priority...the profits that I have received from my creations since the foundation of this business...are disproportionate...[and] you can help to repair in part the prejudices I have suffered in the course of these seventeen years.&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|152-153}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chanel was not aware that the Wertheimers, anticipating the forthcoming [[Nazi]] confiscations had, in May 1940, legally turned control of ''Parfums Chanel'' over to a Christian, French businessman and industrialist [[Felix Amiot]]. At the end of World War II, Amiot returned ''Parfums Chanel'' to the Wertheimers.&lt;ref name=DT /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|150}}

===Chanel maneuvers for control===
[[File:Chanel.JPG|frame|188x223px|Coco Chanel, 1920]]

By the mid-1940s, the worldwide sales of Chanel No. 5 amounted to nine million dollars annually (approximately US$240 million today). The monetary stakes were high and Chanel was determined to wrest control of "Parfums Chanel" from the Wertheimers. Chanel's plan was to destroy customer confidence in the brand, tarnish the image, crippling its marketing and distribution. She let it be known that Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5 was no longer the original fragrance created by "Mademoiselle Chanel", it was no longer being compounded according to her standards and what was now being offered to the public was an inferior product, one she could no longer endorse. Further, Chanel announced she would make available an authentic Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5, to be named "Mademoiselle Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5",&lt;ref name=DT /&gt; offered to a group of select clients.&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|171-172}}

Chanel possibly was unaware that the Wertheimers, who had fled from France to New York in 1940, had instituted a process whereby the quality of Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5 would not be compromised. In America the Wertheimers had recruited H. Gregory Thomas as European emissary for ''Parfums Chanel''. Thomas's mission was to establish the mechanisms required to maintain the quality of the Chanel products, particularly its most profitable fragrance, Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5. Thomas worked to ensure that the supply of key components, the oils of jasmine and tuberose, obtained exclusively in the French town of [[Grasse]], remained uninterrupted by war. Thomas was later promoted to position as president of Chanel US, a position he held for thirty-two years.&lt;ref name=DT /&gt;

Chanel escalated her game plan by instigating a lawsuit against ''Parfums Chanel'' and the Wertheimers. The legal battle garnered wide publicity. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on 3 June 1946:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The suit asks that the French parent concern [''Les Parfums Chanel''] be ordered to cease manufacture and sale of all products bearing the name and restore to her the ownership and sole rights over the products, formulas and manufacturing process [on grounds of] 'inferior quality'.&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|171-172}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Wertheimers were aware of Chanel's collaboration during the Nazi occupation. The progress of legal proceedings would of necessity lead to revelations best kept from public scrutiny. ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine summarized the Wertheimers' dilemma: "[Pierre Wertheimer worries that] a legal fight might illuminate Chanel's wartime activities and wreck her image—and his business".&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|175}}

Ultimately, the Wertheimers and Chanel came to an agreement, re-negotiating the original 1924 contract. On 17 May 1947, Chanel received her share of the wartime profits of Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5, an amount equivalent to some nine million of today's dollars. Post-war, her share would be two percent of all Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5 sales worldwide. The financial benefit to her would be enormous. Her earnings would be in the vicinity of US$25 million a year, making her at the time one of the richest women in the world.&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|176-177}} The new arrangement also gave Chanel the freedom to create new scents, which would be independent of ''Parfums Chanel'', with the proviso that none would contain the number "5" in its name. She never acted on this opportunity.&lt;ref name=DT /&gt;

==Advertising and marketing==

===1920s and 1930s===
Chanel's initial marketing strategy was to generate buzz for her new fragrance by hosting a promotional event. She invited a group of elite friends to dine with her in an elegant restaurant in [[Grasse]] where she surprised and delighted her guests by spraying them with Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5. The official launch place and date of Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5 was in her {{Interlanguage link multi|rue Cambon|fr}} boutique in the fifth month of the year, on the fifth day of the month: 5 May 1921. She infused the shop's dressing rooms with the scent, and she gave bottles to a select few of her high society friends. The success of Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5 was immediate. Chanel's friend [[Misia Sert]] exclaimed: "It was like a winning lottery ticket."&lt;ref name=Vaughan-2011/&gt;{{RP|29}}

''Parfums Chanel'' was the corporate entity established in 1924 to run the production, marketing, and distribution of the fragrance business. Chanel wanted to spread the sale of Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5 from beyond her boutiques to the rest of the world. The first new market was New York City. The initial marketing was discreet and deliberately restricted. The first ad appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 16 December 1924. It was a small ad for ''Parfums Chanel'' announcing the Chanel line of fragrances available at [[Bonwit Teller]], an upscale department store. In the ad, all the bottles were indistinguishable from each another, displaying all the Chanel perfumes available, Numbers 9, 11, 22, and the centerpiece of the line, No. 5. This was the extent of the advertising campaign in the 1920s and appeared only intermittently. In the US, the sale of Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5 was promoted at perfume counters in high-end department stores. The ''[[Galeries Lafayette]]'' was the first retailer of the fragrance in Paris. In France itself, Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5 was not advertised until the 1940s.&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|111-113}}

The first solo advertisement for Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5 ran in ''The New York Times'' on 10 June 1934.&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|132}}

===1940s===
[[File:Chanel N°5 Elixir sensuel.jpg|thumb|upright|Chanel N°5 Elixir sensuel]]

In the early-1940s, when other perfume makers were increasing brand exposure, ''Parfums Chanel'' took a contrary track and decreased advertising. In 1939 and 1940, Chanel ads had been prominent. By 1941, there was almost no Chanel print advertising. The directors of ''Parfums Chanel'' may have felt the expenditure was not needed. Fragrance sales flourished during World War II. Perfume sales in the United States from 1940 to 1945 had increased tenfold; Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5 prospered.&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|147}}

During the war years the directors of ''Parfums Chanel'' came up with an innovative marketing idea. Expanding sales to the middle-class customer had been started in 1934 with the introduction of the pocket ''flaçon''. The plan was now to grow the market by selling the perfume at military [[post exchanges]]. It was a risky move that might have damaged the allure of the brand. It did not destroy the cachet of the brand; instead it became a souvenir the soldier coveted for his sweetheart back home.&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|148-149}}

At the end of World War II, Coco Chanel's wartime collaboration threatened her with arrest and incarceration. In an attempt at damage control, she placed a sign in the window of her rue Cambon boutique, announcing that free bottles of Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5 were available to American GIs. Soldiers waited in long lines to take a bottle of Paris ''luxe'' back home, and "would have been outraged if the French police had touched a hair on her head."&lt;ref name=Vaughan-2011/&gt;{{RP|188}}

===1950s===
In the 1950s the glamour of Chanel No. 5 was reignited by the celebrity of [[Marilyn Monroe]]. Monroe's unsolicited endorsement of the fragrance provided invaluable publicity. In a 1954 interview, when asked what she wore to bed, the movie star provocatively responded: "Just a few drops of Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5."&lt;ref name=InsideChanel/&gt;

===1960s===
In the 1960s the glossy fashion magazines such as ''Vogue'' and ''Bazaar'' presented Chanel No. 5 as a required accessory. Print advertising for Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5 was staid and conservative in both visuals and text, eschewing the energy and quirky aesthetic of the youth culture. Two catch phrases alternated as ad copy: "Every woman alive ''wants'' Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5" and "Every woman alive ''loves'' Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Virginia Postrel |url=http://www.deepglamour.net |title=At the Intersection of Imagination &amp; Desire |publisher=Deep Glamour |date=2014-01-03 |accessdate=2014-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527022319/http://www.deepglamour.net/# |archive-date=27 May 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s and 1980s===
During the 1950s the ads had diminished the allure of Chanel No. 5, identifying it with a scent for sweet, proper co-eds whose style bibles were teenage fashion magazines. In the 1970s the brand name needed revitalization. For the first time  it ran the risk of being labeled as "mass market" and ''passé''. The fragrance was removed from drug stores and similar outlets. Outside advertising agencies were dropped. The rebranding was managed by Jacques Helleu, the artistic director for ''Parfums Chanel''. Helleu chose French actress [[Catherine Deneuve]] as the new face of Chanel. Print ads showcased the iconic sculpture of the bottle. Television commercials were inventive mini-films with production values of surreal fantasy and seduction. Directed by [[Ridley Scott]] in the 1970s and 1980s, they "played on the same visual imagery, with the same silhouette of the bottle."&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|197,199}}

===1990s===
[[File:Chanel N°5.jpg|thumb|upright|Chanel N°5 perfume]]
In the 1990s, more money was reportedly spent advertising Chanel No. 5 than was spent for the promotion of any other fragrance.&lt;ref name="nessymon.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nessymon.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119111340/http://www.nessymon.com/# |archive-date=19 January 2014 |dead-url=bot: unknown |df=dmy-all }}{{failed verification|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carole Bouquet]] was the face of Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5 during this decade. It has been estimated, as of 2011, that between US$20–25 million is spent annually marketing Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fashion – Philosophy for Everyone: Thinking with Style|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781444345544|page=73|last=Freeland|first=Cynthia A.|editor=Jessica Wolfendale, Jeanette Kennett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 2000===
In 2003, actress [[Nicole Kidman]] was enlisted to represent the fragrance. Film director [[Baz Luhrmann]], brought in to conceive and direct a new advertising campaign featuring her, described his concept for what he titled ''[[No. 5 the Film]]'' as "a two-minute trailer ... for a film that has actually never been made, not about Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5 but Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5 is the touchstone".&lt;ref name="nessymon.com" /&gt; The eventual commercial, produced in two-minute and 30-second versions, cost ₤18 million, with Kidman paid US$3.7 million for her work.&lt;ref name="nessymon.com" /&gt;

In May 2012, the company announced that [[Brad Pitt]] would be the first male to advertise Chanel No. 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.adnews.com.au/adnews/brad-pitt-fronts-global-chanel-no-5-push |title=Brad Pitt fronts global Chanel No. 5 push |website=AdNews |date=2012-10-10 |accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Chanel ran an advertising campaign using a recorded interview with [[Marilyn Monroe]] in which she is asked about her use of Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5. It featured [[Ed Feingersh]]'s photograph of the actress splashing herself with a bottle of the perfume. "On her first cover of ''Life'' magazine in 1957, Marilyn Monroe famously said she wore only Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5 to bed. Now, a newly found recording of her from 1960 discussing the subject further with ''Marie Claire''{{'}}s editor-in-chief Georges Belmont is being used in a new advertising campaign for the fragrance set to break this fall. She said people pose questions. "They ask me: 'What do you wear to bed? A pajama top? The bottoms of the pajamas? A nightgown?' So I said, 'Chanel No.&amp;nbsp;5,' because it's the truth" she explained. "And yet, I don't want to say nude. But it's the truth!"&lt;ref name=InsideChanel&gt;{{cite web |title=Chapter 2: Marilyn and No. 5 |url=http://inside.chanel.com/en/marilyn |website=Chanel |publisher=Chanel |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, Luhrmann again collaborated with Chanel, creating a second advertising campaign for No.&amp;nbsp;5, this time starring [[Gisele Bündchen]] and [[Michiel Huisman]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Throughout the film, singer [[Lo-Fang]] performs his slower romantic rendition of ''[[You're the One That I Want]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==The scent==
===Provenance of the "recipe"===
[[File:Ernest Beaux.jpg|thumb|upright|''Le nez de Chanel'': The perfumer Ernest Beaux (1881–1961)]]

Coco Chanel had wanted to develop a distinctly modern fragrance for some time by early-1920. At this time, Chanel's lover was [[Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich Romanov of Russia]], the murderer of [[Rasputin]]. The duke introduced her to Ernest Beaux on the French Riviera. Beaux was the master perfumer at A. Rallet and Company, where he had been employed since 1898. The company was the official perfumer to the Russian royal family, and "the imperial palace at St. Petersburg was a famously perfumed court."&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|52,55}} The favorite scent of the Czarina Alexandra, composed specifically for her by Rallet in Moscow, had been an eau de cologne opulent with rose and jasmine named ''Rallet O-DE-KOLON No.1 Vesovoi.''

In 1912, Beaux created a men's cologne, ''Le Bouquet de Napoleon'', to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the [[Battle of Borodino]], a decisive battle in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Its success inspired Beaux to create a feminine counterpart, whose starting point was the chemical composition of aldehydic multiflores in [[Houbigant (perfume)|Houbigant ]]'s immensely popular fragrance, ''Quelques Fleurs'' (1912).&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|55}}

His experiments with the [[aldehyde]]s in ''Quelques Fleurs'', resulted in a fragrance that he called ''Le Bouquet de Catherine''. He intended to use the scent to celebrate, in 1913, the 300th anniversary of the Romanoff dynasty. The debut of this new perfume was ill-timed commercially. World War I was approaching, and the czarina and the perfume's namesake, the Empress Catherine, had both been German-born. Timing and unfavorable associations, combined with ''Le Bouquet de Catherine'''s hefty price tag, made it a commercial failure. An attempt to re-brand the perfume, as ''Rallet No. 1'' was unsuccessful, and the outbreak of World War I in 1914 effectively killed the product.

Beaux, who had affiliated himself with the Allies and the White Russian army, had spent 1917–1919 as a lieutenant stationed far north, in the last arctic outpost of the continent, [[Arkangelsk]], at Mudyug Island Prison where he interrogated [[Bolshevik]] prisoners.&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|56}} The polar ice, frigid seascape, and whiteness of the snowy terrain sparked his desire to capture the crisp fragrance of this landscape in a new perfume.

Beaux perfected what was to become Chanel No. 5 over several months in the late summer and autumn of 1920. He worked from the [[rose]] and [[jasmine]] base of ''Rallet No. 1'', altering it to make it cleaner, more daring, reminiscent of the polar freshness he had experienced during his war years. He experimented with modern synthetics, adding his own invention "Rose E.B" and notes derived from a new jasmine source, a commercial ingredient called [[Jasophore]]. The revamped, complex formula also increased the quantities of [[orris root]], iris root, and natural musks.

The key was Beaux's use of [[aldehyde]]s. Aldehydes are organic compounds of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. They are manipulated in the laboratory at crucial stages of chemical reaction whereby the process arrests and isolates the scent. When used creatively, aldehydes act as "seasonings", an aroma booster. Beaux's student, [[Constantin Weriguine]], said the aldehyde Beaux used had the clean note of the arctic, "a melting winter note". Legend has it that this concoction was the result of a mishap. A laboratory assistant, mistaking a full strength mixture for a ten percent dilution, had jolted the compound with a quantity of aldehyde never before used. Beaux prepared ten glass vials for Chanel's assessment. Numbered 1–5 and 20–24, each group a variation of the compound. "Number five. Yes," Chanel said later, "that is what I was waiting for. A perfume like nothing else. A woman's perfume, with the scent of a woman."&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;{{RP|60,61-62,65}}

According to Chanel, the formula used to produce No. 5 has changed little since its creation, except for the necessary exclusion of natural [[civet]] and certain [[nitro-musks]].&lt;ref name=Mazzeo-2010/&gt;

'''Contemporary Whitehead Studies''' (CWS) is an interdisciplinary book series that publishes manuscripts from scholars with contemporary and innovative approaches to [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] studies. By publishing innovative and adventurous approaches to Whitehead’s philosophy that engage with the problems, promise, and ideas of the twenty-first century, Contemporary Whitehead Studies creates a vital and dynamic space for scholarly engagement. 
 
The book series was founded in 2009 with [[Rodopi Publishers|Rodopi]] as a special series in the [[Value Inquiry Book Series]]. In 2011 the series moved to [[Lexington Books]], an imprint of [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]].

==Editors==
* Roland Faber, Ph.D., [[Claremont School of Theology]] and [[Claremont Graduate University]], USA
* Brian G. Henning, Ph.D., [[Gonzaga University]], USA

==Mission==
CWS especially seeks projects that:
* explore the connections between Whitehead and contemporary [[continental philosophy]], especially sources, like [[Heidegger]], or contemporary streams like [[poststructuralism]],
* reconnect Whitehead to [[pragmatism]], [[analytical philosophy]] and [[philosophy of language]], as a matter of source and recourse for an understanding of the tradition out of which Whitehead formulated his philosophic concepts or as a matter of engagement in areas that have excluded Whitehead,
* explore creative East/West dialogues facilitated by Whitehead’s work,
* explore the interconnections of the mathematician with the philosopher and the contemporary importance of these parts of Whitehead's work for the dialogue between sciences and humanities,
* reconnect Whitehead to the wider field of philosophy, the humanities, the sciences and academic research with Whitehead's pluralistic impulses in the context of a pluralistic world,
* address Whitehead’s philosophy (and, per example, of philosophy per se) in the midst of contemporary problems facing humanity, such as climate change, war &amp; peace, race, and the future development of civilization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2624">The '''four penny coffin''' (also referred to as a coffin house) is a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] term that described one of the first homeless shelters to be created for the people of central [[London]].  It was operated by the [[Salvation Army]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to provide comfort and aid to its destitute clients. 

The Salvation Army operated other [[homeless shelters]] in the area. These shelters charged the clients different amounts depending on the [[amenities]] offered.  At the low end was a [[penny sit-up]], where a homeless client could get food and shelter from the cold in exchange for a penny.  He was allowed to sit on a bench all night, but was not allowed to sleep.  For an additional penny, there was the "two penny hangover". It was like a penny sit-up except that a rope was placed in front of the bench.  The client was allowed to sleep when he leaned on (or hung over) the rope during the night. He was not allowed to lie down flat on his back and sleep. For four pennies, a [[homeless]] client could stay at a coffin house. [[Image:Fourpence coffin.JPG|thumb|These rows of "coffins" were the men's sleeping quarters in London's Burne Street hostel. Circa 1900]] He received food and shelter.  Moreover, he was allowed to lie down flat on his back and sleep in a [[coffin]] shaped wooden box.  The client was given a [[tarpaulin]] for covering. What made this unique is that it was the cheapest homeless shelter in London at that time that allowed its clients to lie down on their back and sleep. The Salvation Army also offered shelters that allowed its clients to sleep on a bed for a much higher price.  Hence, the coffin house was popular because it offered an economical and midrange solution for homeless clients looking for relief from the cold.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George (1933). Down and Out in Paris and London, Victor Gollancz. {{ISBN|0-15-626224-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared with modern examples this shelter in London is considered inadequate for these individuals. It was however considered an inexpensive and compassionate attempt to deal with the relatively new problem of homelessness. This shelter provided relief from the harsh London winters and was viewed by many at the time as having the benefit of attracting new followers to the [[Christian]] faith.

'''Francisco Xavier Alegre''' (November 12, 1729 – August 16, 1788) was a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Scholarly method#Scholars|scholar]], [[Translation|translator]], and [[historian]] of New Spain.

==Life==
Alegre was born in [[Veracruz]], [[New Spain]]. He studied philosophy in the Royal College of San Ignacio in [[Puebla]], then canon and civil law in [[Mexico City]] and theology in Angelópolis. On March 19, 1747 he entered the novitiate with the [[Company of Jesus]] (Jesuits) in Tepozotlán. According to his own account, he learned [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Náhuatl language|Náhuatl]]. He was able to preach in Náhuatl. He was a dedicated scholar of theology, history, mathematics, and especially 
classical literature.

He later taught grammar in Mexico City, and during those years he learned [[French language|French]]. For reasons of health he returned to Veracruz, where he taught for two years. He then returned to Mexico City to take an examination in theology, and there he was ordained a priest.

His health was still poor. He was sent to [[Havana]], where he taught rhetoric and philosophy for seven years.

On leaving Havana, he went to [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]], to the Jesuit college there. He took over the work on the ''Historia de la provincia'' begun by Father Francisco de Florencia (1620–1695). He continued work on this history when he moved to the Royal College and Seminary of San Ildefonso in Mexico City. In less than three years, he finished the ''Historia de la Compañía de Jesús en Nueva España''. This work was on the point of being published when the Jesuits were expelled from the Spanish dominions, on July 25, 1767. When he left New Spain, the manuscript and his sources remained behind.

Alegre died of apoplexy near [[Bologna]], [[Italy]], in 1788. Some of his works remained unpublished at his death.

==Works==
In exile, he established himself in Bologna, Italy, and there he rewrote his ''Historia'' from memory, in the form of a compendium. It was published in Mexico in 1841-1842. He also wrote 18 books, published together under the title ''Instituciones teológicas''.

His literary works included ''Alexandrias'', a short epic poem about the conquest of Tyre by Alexander the Great (1775) and a Latin eclogue entitled ''Nysus''. He also published a Latin translation of the [[Iliad]], at Bologna in 1776 and, after revisions, at Rome in 1788. He translated the first three cantos of [[Nicolas Boileau]]'s ''L'Art poétique'' into Spanish.

He left quite a number of shorter works, mostly translations of classics. Among them are the "Alexandriadas" (1773, [[Italy]]), the "[[Iliad]]" in [[Latin]] ([[Rome]], 1788), "Homeri Batrachiomachia" in Latin (Mexico, 1789), together with fragments of [[Horace]] and a good translation into Spanish of the first three cantos of the "Art Poétique" of [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]].

But the work for which he is especially noted is his ''History of the Society of Jesus in New Spain'' (ed. Carlos María Bustamante, Mexico, 1841). Although composed at a time when the order was persecuted in Spanish colonies, and often with great rigor, the tone of this most valuable work, indispensable for the study of the colonial history of Mexico and of many of its Indian tribes, is, according to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' "dignified and free from attacks upon Spain and the Spaniards.".

He published ''Carta geográfica del hemisferio mexicano'', which introduced some information about New Spain previously unknown to European scholars.

In 1889, Joaquín García Icazbaleta published his lyrical works under the title ''Opúsculos inéditos latinos y castellanos del P. Francisco Xavier Alegre'' (''Unedited Latin and Spanish tracts of Father Francisco Xavier Alegre''). His Latin writing style was pure and classical, comparing well with theologians of the Renaissance.

The '''German Forest''' ({{lang-de|Deutscher Wald}}) was a phrase used both as a [[metaphor]] as well as to describe in exaggerated terms an idyllic landscape in German poems, fairy tales and legends of the early 19th century [[Romantic period]]. Historical and cultural discourses declared it as the symbol of Germanic-German art and culture, or as in the case of [[Heinrich Heine]] or [[Anne Louise Germaine de Staël|Madame de Staël]], as a counter-image of French urbanity. It was also used with reference to historical or legendary events in German forests, such as [[Tacitus]]' description of the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] or even the nature mysticism of the stylized Germanic national myth, the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'' as the history of its multi-faceted reception shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-giessen.de/germanistik/Personen/ehris.shtml Publikationen zur Rezeptionsgeschichte des Nibelungenliedes von Otfrid-Reinald Ehrismann] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403181833/http://www.uni-giessen.de/germanistik/Personen/ehris.shtml |date=2008-04-03 }}, retrieved 23 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 



The early conservation and [[environmental movement]], the tourism that was already under way in the 19th century, the [[German Youth Movement|youth movement]], the social democratic [[Friends of Nature]], the [[Wandervogel|Wandervögel]] youth groups, the [[Association of German mountain and hiking clubs|walking clubs]] and the right-wing [[Völkisch movement]] saw in forests an important element of German [[cultural landscape]]s.

[[:de:Nachhaltigkeit|Nachhaltigkeit]] is the German principle for sustainability, which has been used throughout history and is at the core values of German forestry as a whole.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=RADKAU|first=JOACHIM|date=October 14, 2018|title=Wood and Forestry in German History: In Quest of an Environmental Approach|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20722998?seq=4#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Environment and History|volume=2|pages=63-76|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nachhaltigkeit is what the German forests are famous for throughout the globe, and in terms of environmental practices. German forests in particular through the 19th century had state-issued guards in the forests across Germany, limiting access to citizens in order to preserve resources&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjsg1|title=The Turning Points of Environmental History|date=2010|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=9780822961185|editor-last=Uekoetter|editor-first=Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This practice helped cut down on deforestation, though like the majority of the western world at this time, did not completely work.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This was partly due to the extensive manicuring of the forests, including the rigid structure of growing trees in rows and clearing any underbrush. This weakened the natural ecosystem of the forests, and made the trees more prone to pests and disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wrnfr|title=Greening the City: Urban Landscapes in the Twentieth Century|date=2011|publisher=University of Virginia Press|editor-last=Brantz|editor-first=Dorothee|editor-last2=Dümpelmann|editor-first2=Sonja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==
Germany's strict control over its forests allowed for the ideal of German romantic forests, that were idolized and used in literature to show the beauty and magic of nature.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hj2sz|title=Germany's Nature: Cultural Landscapes and Environmental History|date=2005|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813536675|editor-last=LEKAN|editor-first=THOMAS|editor-last2=ZELLER|editor-first2=THOMAS}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many fairy tales have been inspired by the German forests, such as works from [[Brothers Grimm]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]]. Musicians such as [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Richard Wagner]], and [[Franz Schubert]] have also written works about German forests. Core ideas in these writings are love for Germany and the forests, unity, brooding, and magic. It can be said that these themes showed unity for Germany as a whole, while describing the forests similarly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hj2sz|title=Germany's Nature: Cultural Landscapes and Environmental History|date=2005|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813536675|editor-last=LEKAN|editor-first=THOMAS|editor-last2=ZELLER|editor-first2=THOMAS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The setting for these fairy tales are commonly the [[Black Forest]] of Germany, though the location of other fairy tales can vary in Germany's many forests.

== Nazi Regime ==
During [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]], the idea of conversationism for German Forests coincided with the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] propaganda of an attack on liberal values. The Nazis used the phrase Naturgemasse Waldwirtschaft, "forestry according to nature," to explain that in all forms, they (the Nazis) were merely restoring Germany back to its purest form.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=RADKAU|first=JOACHIM|date=October 14, 2018|title=Wood and Forestry in German History: In Quest of an Environmental Approach|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20722998?seq=4#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Environment and History|volume=2|pages=63-76|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the core of the Nazi party was not particularly fond of forests in their natural state, as the forests expressed the diversity of Germany that the Nazi party was trying to eradicate. Many minorities would also hide in the forests for protection from those that did not know the land as well, and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] was known to call the forest a hiding place for weak ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hj2sz|title=Germany's Nature: Cultural Landscapes and Environmental History|date=2005|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813536675|editor-last=LEKAN|editor-first=THOMAS|editor-last2=ZELLER|editor-first2=THOMAS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, Nazi regime tried to protect German forests and saw them as a symbol of nationalistic excellence in their purity. Any conservation efforts brought by the Nazis were undermined by military plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olsen|first=Jonathan|date=2007-02-07|title=How Green Were the Nazis? Nature, Environment, and Nation in the Third Reich (review)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/209855|journal=Technology and Culture|language=en|volume=48|issue=1|pages=207–208|doi=10.1353/tech.2007.0036|issn=1097-3729}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Nazism|Nazi]] ideology, the motif of the "German Forest" was comparable to their "[[Blood and Soil]]" slogan, a typical Germanic symbol. Propaganda, political symbolism and landscape planning drew on this as a central theme for the period after a German victory.&lt;ref&gt;''"Unmittelbar an der Grenze unseres neuen Lebensraumes gegen Osten müssen auch Bäume als deutsche Zeichen des Lebens stehen."'' from: Heinrich Friedrich Wiepking-Jürgensmann: ''Deutsche Landschaft als deutsche Ostaufgabe'' In: Neues Bauerntum, Jg. 32 (1940), Issue 4/5, p.&amp;nbsp;132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Albrecht Lehmann has postulated the continuity of a romantic forest idealism in the German peoples from the Romantic period to the 21st century that transcends class and generation.&lt;ref name="Lehmannlz"&gt;Lehmann, Albrecht (2001): ''Mythos deutscher Wald.'' In: Landeszentrale für politische Bildung Baden-Württemberg (publ.): ''Der deutsche Wald''. 51st Annual, Issue 1 (2001) ''Der Bürger im Staat''. pp. 4–9&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of the intense and distinctive handling of the cultural forest include the discussion of environmental damage and [[forest dieback]], and the forms of commemoration and mourning associated with  [[woodland cemeteries]] and [[natural burial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Birgit Heller, Franz Winter (eds.): ''Tod und Ritual: interkulturelle Perspektiven zwischen Tradition und Moderne.'' Österreichische Gesellschaft für Religionswissenschaft, LIT Verlag, Berlin-Hamburg-Münster, 2007, {{ISBN|3825895645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polls show a specifically German notion of equating forests and nature. The forest as an educational medium and healthy environment has, in the context of [[environmental education]] (see, [[Protection of German forests#forest education|forest education]] and [[forest kindergarten]])&lt;ref&gt;Waldpädagogik und Wahrnehmung von Wald und Natur, Kulturelle Bedingungen von Naturschutz und Umweltbildung vor dem Hintergrund sich wandelnder gesellschaftlicher Naturverhältnisse, Magister-Arbeit im Studiengang Soziologie, vorgelegt von Markus Barth, Gutachter: Prof. Dr. Erhard Stölting und Dr. Fritz Reusswig, Berlin, 16 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; has a particular significance in the German-speaking region.

The '''golden age of arcade video games''' was the era when [[Arcade game#Arcade video games|arcade video games]] entered pop culture and became a dominant cultural force. The exact time period is disputed, but key moments include the release of ''[[Space Invaders]]'' in 1978 and the [[vector monitor|vector-based]] ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'' in 1979&amp;mdash;moments made possible by the increase in power and decrease in cost of computing technology. This led to the rise of both video game arcades and video games in other media, such as songs, cartoons, and movies like 1982's ''[[Tron (franchise)|TRON]]''. Other iconic games from this era include ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Defender (video game)|Defender]]'', ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', and ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]''.

==Relevant time period==
Although the exact years differ, all timelines overlap in the early 1980s. Technology journalist Jason Whittaker, in ''The Cyberspace Handbook'', places the beginning of the golden age in 1978, with the release of ''[[Space Invaders]]''.&lt;ref name="Whittaker-122"&gt;{{citation|title=The cyberspace handbook|author=Jason Whittaker|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2004|isbn=0-415-16835-X|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video game journalist [[Steven L. Kent]], in his book ''The Ultimate History of Video Games'', places it at 1979 to 1983.&lt;ref name="UltimateHistory"&gt;{{cite book| last = Kent| first = Steven L.| authorlink = Steven L. Kent| title = The Ultimate History of Video Games: From Pong to Pokémon| publisher = [[Three Rivers Press]]| year = 2001| isbn = 0-7615-3643-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book pointed out that 1979 was the year that ''Space Invaders''&lt;ref name="Kent-116"&gt;{{cite book| last = Kent| first = Steven L.| authorlink = Steven L. Kent| title = The Ultimate History of Video Games: From Pong to Pokémon| publisher = [[Three Rivers Press]]| year = 2001| isbn = 0-7615-3643-4| page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; – which he credits for ushering in the golden age&lt;ref name="Kent-500"&gt;{{cite book| last = Kent| first = Steven L.| authorlink = Steven L. Kent| title = The Ultimate History of Video Games: From Pong to Pokémon| publisher = [[Three Rivers Press]]| year = 2001| isbn = 0-7615-3643-4| page=500}}&lt;/ref&gt; – was gaining considerable popularity in the United States,&lt;ref name="Kent-116"/&gt; and the year that saw [[vector display]] technology, first seen in arcades in 1977 with ''[[Space Wars]]'', rise to prominence via Atari's ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''. However, 1983 was the period that began "a fairly steady decline" in the coin-operated video game business and when many arcades started disappearing.&lt;ref name="UltimateHistory"/&gt;

The History of Computing Project places the golden age of video games between 1971 and 1983, covering the "mainstream appearance of video games as a consumer market" and "the rise of dedicated hardware systems and the origin of multi-game cartridge based systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thocp.net/software/games/games.htm |title=History of Computing: Videogames Index |publisher=Thocp.net |date=2012-08-11 |accessdate=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1971 was chosen as an earlier start date by the project for two reasons: the creator of ''[[Pong]]'' filed a pivotal patent regarding video game technology, and it was the release of the first arcade video game machine, ''[[Computer Space]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thocp.net/software/games/golden_age.htm#1971 |title=History of Computing: Video games - Golden Age |publisher=Thocp.net |accessdate=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sean Newton, 3D arcade model builder and author of the book ''[[Bits, Sticks, and Buttons.|Bits, Sticks, and Buttons]]'' states that the defining transitional point which finally ended the first era of arcade gaming (known as the "Black and White Age") and subsequently ushered in the Golden Age was with the North American release of Midway's ''[[Space Invaders]]''. The game brought forth with it the power of the microprocessor, as well as a cult phenomenon impact which had only been felt up to that point by Atari's ''Pong''. Following ''Space Invaders'', Atari's ''Asteroids'' and Namco's ''Pac-Man'' further solidified the strength of the Golden Age.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Other opinions place this period's beginning in the late 1970s, when color arcade games became more prevalent and [[video arcade]]s themselves started appearing outside of their traditional [[bowling alley]] and [[public house|bar]] locales, through to its ending in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://207.239.218.46/index.aspx?c=17&amp;id=1327 |title=Chapter 13 – The Golden Age Ends |last=Day |first=Walter |authorlink=Walter Day |date=February 8, 1998 |work=The Golden Age of Video Game Arcades |publisher=[[Twin Galaxies]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604104154/http://207.239.218.46/index.aspx?c=17 |archivedate=June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The golden age of arcade games largely coincided with, and partly fueled, the [[History of video game consoles (second generation)|second generation of game consoles]] and the [[microcomputer revolution]].

==Business==
The golden age was a time of great technical and design creativity in arcade games. The era saw the rapid spread of [[video arcade]]s across North America, Europe, and Asia. The number of video game arcades in North America, for example, more than doubled between 1980 and 1982;&lt;ref name="Wolf-105"&gt;{{citation|title=The Video Game Explosion: A History from PONG to PlayStation and Beyond|author=Mark J.

Some games like ''[[Robby Roto]]'' failed because they were too complex to learn quickly, and others like ''[[Star Fire]]'' because they were too unfamiliar to the audience. ''[[Qix]]'' was briefly very popular but, Taito's Keith Egging later said, "too mystifying for gamers ... impossible to master and when the novelty wore off, the game faded".&lt;ref name="pearl198306"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1983-06/Electronic_Games_Issue_16_Vol_02_04_1983_Jun#page/n79/mode/2up | title=Closet Classics | work=Electronic Games | date=June 1983 | accessdate=6 January 2015 | author=Pearl, Rick | pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around this time, the home video game industry ([[History of video game consoles (second generation)|second-generation]] [[video game console]]s and early [[PC game|home computer games]]) emerged as "an outgrowth of the widespread success of video arcades" at the time.&lt;ref name="Enterprise-1982"/&gt;

The video arcade industry took in $8&amp;nbsp;billion in quarters in 1982, surpassing pop music (at $4&amp;nbsp;billion in sales per year) and Hollywood films ($3&amp;nbsp;billion). Those 32&amp;nbsp;billion arcade games played translate to 143 games for every man, woman, and child in America. A recent Atari survey showed that 86 percent of the US population from 13 to 20 has played some kind of video game and an estimated 8&amp;nbsp;million US homes have video games hooked up to the television set.

and ''[[Tempest (video game)|Tempest]]'' with 29,000 units.&lt;ref name="atari_memo2"/&gt; A number of arcade games also generated revenues (from quarters) in the hundreds of millions, including ''Defender'' with more than $100&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref name="Mark J.

The most successful arcade game companies of this era included Taito (which ushered in the golden age with the [[shooter game]] ''Space Invaders''&lt;ref name="Kent-500"/&gt; and produced other successful arcade [[action game]]s such as ''[[Gun Fight]]'' and ''[[Jungle Hunt|Jungle King]]''), [[Namco]] (the Japanese company that created ''Galaxian'', ''Pac-Man'', ''[[Pole Position]]'' and ''[[Dig Dug]]'') and [[Atari]] (the company that introduced video games into arcades with ''Computer Space'' and ''Pong'', and later produced ''Asteroids''). Other companies such as [[Sega]] (who later entered the home console market against its former arch rival, Nintendo), [[Nintendo]] (whose [[mascot]], [[Mario]], was introduced in 1981's ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' as "Jumpman"), [[Midway Games|Bally Midway Manufacturing Company]] (which was later purchased by Williams), [[Cinematronics]], [[Konami]], [[Centuri]], [[Williams (gaming company)|Williams]] and [[SNK Playmore|SNK]] also gained popularity around this era.

==Technology==
Arcades catering to video games began to gain momentum in the late 1970s with games such as ''[[Space Invaders]]'' (1978), ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'' (1979), and ''[[Galaxian]]'' (1979), and became widespread in 1980 with ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Missile Command]]'', ''[[Berzerk (arcade game)|Berzerk]]'', ''[[Defender (video game)|Defender]]'', and others. The [[central processing unit]] in these games allowed for more complexity than earlier [[Digital data|discrete circuitry]] games such as Atari's ''[[Pong]]'' (1972). The arcade boom that began in the late 1970s is credited with establishing the basic techniques of [[interactive entertainment]] and for driving down hardware prices to the extent of allowing the [[Personal computer|PC]] to become a technological and economic reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Digital illusion: entertaining the future with high technology |chapter=Chapter 30: Coin-Op: The Life (Arcade Videogames) |author=Mark Stephen Pierce (Atari Games Corporation) |publisher=[[ACM Press]] |year=1998 |isbn=0-201-84780-9 |url=http://www.communication.illinois.edu/csandvig/classes/Pierce.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723224105/http://www.communication.illinois.edu/csandvig/classes/Pierce.pdf |archivedate=July 23, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While color monitors had been used by several [[racing video game]]s before (such as ''[[Indy 800]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{KLOV game|8190|Indy 800}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Speed Race|Speed Race Twin]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{KLOV game|9711|Speed Race Twin}}&lt;/ref&gt;), it was during this period that [[RGB]] color graphics became widespread, following the release of ''Galaxian'' in 1979.&lt;ref name="joystick1_10"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Arcade Games|journal=Joystick|date=September 1982|volume=1|issue=1|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Golden Age also saw developers experimenting with [[vector monitor|vector displays]], which produced crisp lines that couldn't be duplicated by [[raster graphics|raster display]]s. A few of these vector games became great hits, such as 1979's ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'', 1980's ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]'' and ''[[Tempest (arcade game)|Tempest]]'' and 1983's ''[[Star Wars (1983 video game)|Star Wars]]'' from Atari. However, vector technology fell out of favor with arcade game companies due to the high cost of repairing vector displays.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Several developers at the time were also experimenting with [[2.5D|pseudo-3D]] and [[Stereoscopic video game|stereoscopic 3D]] using [[2D computer graphics|2D sprites]] on [[Raster graphics|raster displays]]. In 1979, [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Radar Scope]]'' introduced a three-dimensional [[Third-person shooter|third-person perspective]] to the [[shoot 'em up]] genre, later imitated by [[Shooter game|shooters]] such as [[Konami]]'s ''[[Juno First]]'' and [[Activision]]'s ''[[Beamrider]]'' in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&amp;cId=3181467 Where Were They Then: The First Games of Nintendo, Konami, and More (Nintendo)], [[1UP.com|1UP]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Sega's ''[[Turbo (video game)|Turbo]]'' was the first racing game to feature a third-person rear view format,&lt;ref&gt;{{KLOV game|id=10216|name=Turbo}}&lt;/ref&gt; and use [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] scaling with full-colour graphics.&lt;ref name=IGN-Sega-p1&gt;[http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/974/974695p1.html IGN Presents the History of SEGA], [[IGN]]&lt;/ref&gt; Namco's ''[[Pole Position (video game)|Pole Position]]'' featured an improved rear-view racer format in 1982 that would remain the standard for the genre; the game provided a perspective view of the track, with its vanishing point swaying side to side as the player approaches corners, accurately simulating forward movement into the distance.&lt;ref name="Bernard Perron 2008 p. 157"&gt;Bernard Perron &amp; Mark J. P. Wolf (2008), ''Video game theory reader two'', p. 157, [[Taylor &amp; Francis]], {{ISBN|0-415-96282-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Sega released ''[[Zaxxon]]'', which introduced the use of [[Isometric graphics in video games|isometric graphics]] and shadows;&lt;ref name=Perron&gt;Bernard Perron &amp; Mark J. P. Wolf (2008), ''Video game theory reader two'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=oe0zNalKkTgC&amp;pg=PA158 p. 158], [[Taylor &amp; Francis]], {{ISBN|0-415-96282-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[SubRoc-3D]]'', which introduced the use of [[List of stereoscopic video games|stereoscopic 3D]] through a special eyepiece;&lt;ref&gt;{{KLOV game|9856|SubRoc-3D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This period also saw significant advances in [[digital audio]] technology. ''Space Invaders'' in 1978 was the first game to use a continuous [[Video game music|background soundtrack]], with four simple [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatic]] descending [[bass note]]s repeating in a loop, though it was dynamic and changed pace during stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Pac-Man to pop music: interactive audio in games and new media|author=Karen Collins|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing|Ashgate]]|year=2008|isbn=0-7546-6200-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lFEYAQAAIAAJ|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rally-X'' in 1980 was the first game to feature continuous [[Video game music|background music]],&lt;ref name="GamesRadar-2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/gamings-most-important-evolutions/a-20101008102331322035/p-2 |title=Gaming's Most Important Evolutions |page=2 |publisher=[[GamesRadar]] |date=October 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615221800/http://www.gamesradar.com/f/gamings-most-important-evolutions/a-20101008102331322035/p-2 |archivedate=June 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was generated using a dedicated [[sound chip]], a Namco 3-channel [[Programmable sound generator|PSG]].&lt;ref name="KLOV-Rally"/&gt; That same year saw the introduction of [[speech synthesis]], which was first used in ''[[Stratovox]]'', released by [[Sunsoft|Sun Electronics]] in 1980,&lt;ref name="GamesRadar-2"/&gt; followed soon after by Namco's ''[[King &amp; Balloon]]''.

Developers also experimented with [[laserdisc]] players for delivering [[full motion video based game]]s with movie-quality animation. The first [[laserdisc video game]] to exploit this technology was 1983's ''[[Astron Belt]]'' from Sega,&lt;ref name="AtariHQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=ASTRON BELT|publisher=Atari HQ|url=http://www.atarihq.com/coinops/laser/astbelt.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Astron-Belt"&gt;{{allgame|9550|Astron Belt}}&lt;/ref&gt; soon followed by ''[[Dragon's Lair]]'' from [[Cinematronics]]; the latter was a sensation when it was released (and, in fact, the laserdisc players in many machines broke due to overuse). While laserdisc games were usually either [[shooter game]]s with full-motion video backdrops like ''Astron Belt'' or [[interactive movie]]s like ''Dragon's Lair'', [[Data East]]'s 1983 game ''[[Bega's Battle]]'' introduced a new form of video game storytelling: using brief full-motion video [[cutscene]]s to develop a story between the game's shooting stages, which would years later become the standard approach to video game storytelling. By the mid-1980s, the genre dwindled in popularity, as laserdiscs were losing out to the VHS format and the laserdisc games themselves were losing their novelty.&lt;ref name="Fahs"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lives and Deaths of the Interactive Movie|author=Travis Fahs|publisher=IGN|date=March 3, 2008|url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/856/856379p2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
With the enormous success of the early games, dozens of [[video game developer|developers]] jumped into the development and manufacturing of video arcade games. Some simply copied the "invading alien hordes" idea of ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and turned out successful imitators like Namco's ''[[Galaxian]],'' ''[[Galaga]],'' and ''[[Gaplus]]'', though they took the [[shoot 'em up]] genre further with new gameplay mechanics, more complex enemy patterns, and richer graphics.&lt;ref name="lecture"&gt;[http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/classes/cmps080k/Winter07/lectures/shmups.pdf Game Genres: Shmups], Professor Jim Whitehead, January 29, 2007, Retrieved June 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Levi, [http://uk.wireless.ign.com/articles/394/394165p1.html Galaxian Mini] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713005142/http://uk.wireless.ign.com/articles/394/394165p1.html |date=July 13, 2011 }}, ''IGN'', April 21, 2003, Retrieved June 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ''Galaxian'' introduced a "risk-reward" concept,&lt;ref name="klov_galaxian"&gt;{{KLOV game|7885|Galaxian}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Galaga'' was one of the first games with a [[bonus stage]].&lt;ref name="KLOV-galaga"&gt;{{KLOV game|id=7881|name=Galaga}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sega's 1980 release ''[[Shoot 'em up#Golden age and refinement|Space Tactics]]'' was an early [[First-person shooter|first-person]] [[Space flight simulator game|space combat]] game with multi-directional [[scrolling]] as the player moved the [[cross-hair]]s on the screen.&lt;ref name="Space-Tactics"&gt;{{KLOV game|id=9683|name=Space Tactics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others tried new concepts and defined new genres. Rapidly evolving hardware allowed new kinds of games which allowed for different styles of gameplay. In 1980, Namco released ''[[Pac-Man]]'', which popularized the [[List of maze chase games|maze chase]] genre, and ''[[Rally-X]]'', which featured a [[Automap|radar]] tracking the player position on the map.&lt;ref name="KLOV-Rally"/&gt; Games such as the pioneering 1981 games ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' and ''[[Qix]]'' in 1981 introduced new types of games where skill and timing are more important than shooting as fast as possible, with [[Nintendo]]'s ''Donkey Kong'' in particular setting the template for the [[platform game]] genre.&lt;ref name="GamesRadar-3"/&gt; Namco's ''[[Bosconian]]'' in 1981 introduced a [[Open world|free-roaming]] [[Nonlinear gameplay|style of gameplay]] where the player's ship freely moves across open space, while also including a radar tracking player &amp; enemy positions.&lt;ref name="Bosconian"&gt;{{allgame|398|Bosconian}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bega's Battle]]'' in 1983 introduced a new form of video game storytelling: using brief [[Full motion video based game|full-motion video]] [[cutscene]]s to develop a story between the game's shooting stages.&lt;ref name="Fahs"/&gt; Other examples of innovative games are [[Atari Games]]' ''[[Paperboy (game)|Paperboy]]'' in 1984 where the goal is to successfully deliver newspapers to customers, and Namco's ''[[Phozon]]'' where the object is to duplicate a shape shown in the middle of the screen. The theme of [[Exidy]]'s ''[[Venture (arcade game)|Venture]]'' is [[dungeon]] exploration and treasure-gathering. One innovative game, ''[[QBert|Q*Bert]]'', played upon the user's sense of [[depth perception]] to deliver a novel experience.

Some games of this era were so popular that they entered [[popular culture]]. The first to do so was ''Space Invaders''.

Soon after the release of ''Space Invaders'', hundreds of favourable articles and stories about the emerging video game medium aired on television and were printed in newspapers and magazines. The Space Invaders Tournament held by Atari in 1980 was the first [[Electronic sports|video game competition]] and attracted more than 10,000 participants, establishing [[Video game culture|video gaming]] as a mainstream hobby.&lt;ref name="eg_2_36"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Players Guide To Electronic Science Fiction Games|journal=[[Electronic Games]]|date=March 1982|volume=1|issue=2|pages=35–45 [36]|url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1982-03/Electronic_Games_Issue_02_Vol_01_02_1982_Mar#page/n35/mode/1up|accessdate=February 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1980, 86% of the 13–20 population in the United States had played arcade video games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Trachtman |first=Paul |title=A generation meets computers on the playing fields of Atari |url=http://www.gamearchive.com/General/Articles/ClassicNews/1981/Smith-9-81-Pg52.htm |accessdate=March 7, 2012 |newspaper=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319114953/http://www.gamearchive.com/General/Articles/ClassicNews/1981/Smith-9-81-Pg52.htm |archivedate=March 19, 2006 |pages=50–53 [52] |date=September 1981 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1981, there were more than 35 million gamers visiting video game arcades in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wojahn|first=Ellen|title=The General Mills/Parker Brothers merger: playing by different rules|year=2003|publisher=Beard Books|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=1-58798-182-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3aszv5J3wXcC&amp;pg=PA120|accessdate=February 25, 2012|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game that most affected popular culture in North America was ''[[Pac-Man]]''. Its release in 1980 caused such a sensation that it initiated what is now referred to as "Pac-Mania" (which later became [[Pac-Mania|the title of the last coin-operated game in the series]], released in 1987). Released by [[Namco]], the game featured a yellow, circle-shaped creature trying to eat dots through a maze while avoiding pursuing enemies. Though no one could agree what the "hero" or enemies represented (they were variously referred to as ghosts, goblins or monsters), the game was extremely popular. The game spawned an [[Pac-Man (TV series)|animated television series]], numerous clones, ''Pac-Man''-branded foods, toys, and a hit pop song, "[[Pac-Man Fever (song)|Pac-Man Fever]]". The game's popularity was such that President [[Ronald Reagan]] congratulated a player for setting a record score in ''Pac-Man''.&lt;ref name="mitchell"&gt;Ramsey, David.

''Oxford American'', issue 53. Spring 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pac-Man'' was also responsible for expanding the arcade game market to involve large numbers of female audiences across all age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Worley|first=Joyce|title=Women Join the Arcade Revolution|journal=[[Electronic Games]]|date=May 1982|volume=1|issue=3|pages=30–33|url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1982-05/Electronic_Games_Issue_03_Vol_01_03_1982_May#page/n31/mode/2up|accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though many popular games quickly entered the lexicon of popular culture, most have since left, and ''Pac-Man'' is unusual in remaining a recognized term in popular culture, along with ''Space Invaders'', ''[[Donkey Kong]]'', ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' and ''[[Q*bert]]''.

In 1983, an animated television series produced for Saturday mornings called [[Saturday Supercade]] featured video game characters from the era, such as Frogger, Donkey Kong, Q*bert, Donkey Kong Jr., Kangaroo, Space Ace, and Pitfall Harry.

Arcade games at the time affected on the [[music industry]], revenues for which had declined by $400&amp;nbsp;million between 1978 and 1981 (from $4.1 billion to $3.7 billion), a decrease that was directly credited to the rise of arcade games at the time.&lt;ref name="Durant-1982"&gt;{{citation|title=Movie Studios Purchase Piece Of Video Game Action|work=[[The Durant Daily Democrat]]|date=July 14, 1982|page=22|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qwlbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A04NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1192,1139884}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful songs based on video games also began appearing.

Since 2010, many arcade-related feature films have been released including ''[[Wreck It Ralph]]'' (2012), ''[[Pixels (2015 film)|Pixels]]'' (2015) and ''[[Ready Player One (2018 film)|Ready Player One]]'' (2018) which is based upon the novel by [[Ernest Cline]] and directed by [[Steven Spielberg]].

==Strategy guides==
The period saw the emergence of a gaming media, publications dedicated to video games, in the form of [[video game journalism]] and [[strategy guide]]s.&lt;ref name="CBC-1982"/&gt; The enormous popularity of video arcade games led to the very first video game strategy guides;&lt;ref name="Ludington-1982"&gt;{{cite web|title=Learn The Code Book And Beat Video Games|work=[[Ludington, Michigan#Media|Ludington Daily News]]|date=March 1, 1982|page=25|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HZpaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j0sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4643,3691324}}&lt;/ref&gt; these guides (rare to find today) discussed in detail the patterns and strategies of each game, including variations, to a degree that few guides seen since can match. "Turning the machine over"—making the score counter overflow and reset to zero—was often the final challenge of a game for those who mastered it, and the last obstacle to getting the highest score.

Some of these strategy guides sold hundreds of thousands of copies at prices ranging from $1.95 to $3.95 in 1982&lt;ref name="Ludington-1982"/&gt; (equivalent to between ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|1.95|1982|r=0}}}} and ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|3.95|1982|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}).&lt;ref name="Inflation"&gt;{{cite web|title=CPI Inflation Calculator|publisher=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]|url=http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm|accessdate=March 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Ken Uston's ''Mastering Pac-Man'' sold 750,000 copies, reaching No. 5 on [[B.

==Decline and aftermath==
{{see also|Arcade game#History|l1=Arcade game: History}}

The golden age cooled around the mid-1980s as copies of popular games began to saturate the arcades. Arcade video game revenues in the United States had declined from $8 billion in 1981 and $7 billion in 1982 to $5 billion in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Can Lasers Save VIdeo Arcades?|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB29715971BCAA2&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=March 13, 2012|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=February 3, 1984|quote=Last year, arcade game revenues were approximately $5 billion, compared to $8 billion in 1981 and $7 billion in 1982.}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching a low of $4 billion in 1986.&lt;ref name="atlanta89"&gt;{{cite news|title=Video Games Are an Exercise In Annihilation|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&amp;p_theme=at&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB7C3DCADD9B6C0&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=March 13, 2012|newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=May 30, 1989|quote=In 1988, players dropped enough change at video arcades to generate revenues of $6.4 billion, up from $4 billion in 1986. Many of those quarters were powering machine guns and fists of fury. According to the April issue of RePlay magazine, 29 of the 45 most popular video games are action games. Three of the top five games listed by PlayMeter were ones with war or fighting themes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, arcades would remain commonplace through to the early 1990s as there were still new genres being explored. In 1987, arcades experienced a short resurgence with ''[[Double Dragon]]'', which started the golden age of [[beat 'em up]] games, a [[Video game genres|genre]] that would peak in popularity with ''[[Final Fight (video game)|Final Fight]]'' two years later.&lt;ref name="tao2"&gt;Spencer, Spanner, [http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/a_taoofbeatemups_pt2_retro The Tao of Beat-'em-ups (part 2)], ''EuroGamer'', Feb 12, 2008, Retrieved Mar 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, arcade game revenues in the United States rose back up to $6.4 billion, largely due to the rising popularity of [[Video game controversies|violent]] [[action game]]s in the beat 'em up and [[run and gun (video game)|run and gun]] [[shooter game|shooter]] [[Video game genre|genres]].&lt;ref name="atlanta89"/&gt; After yet another relative decline,&lt;ref name="tao2"/&gt; U.S. arcade video game revenues had fallen to $2.1 billion by 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Tracy|title=Are Arcades Archaic?

One of the causes of decline was new generations of personal computers and [[video game console]]s that sapped interest from arcades. In the early 1990s, the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] (Mega Drive outside most of North America) and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] (the Super Famicom in Japan) greatly improved home play and some of their technology was even integrated into a few video arcade machines.

==Legacy==
The Golden Age of Video Arcade Games spawned numerous cultural icons and even gave some companies their identity. Elements from games such as ''[[Space Invaders]]'', ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'', ''[[Frogger]]'', and ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'' are still recognized in today's popular culture, and new entries in the franchises for some golden age games continued to be released decades later.

''[[Pac-Man]]'' and ''[[Dragon's Lair]]'' joined ''[[Pong]]'' for permanent display at the [[Smithsonian]] in Washington, D.C. for their cultural impact in the United States. No other video game has been inducted since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thocp.net/software/games/golden_age.htm#PacMan History of Computing: Video games – Golden Age] from The History of Computing Project&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bónis György jogtörténész.jpg|thumb|right|György Bónis (c. 1960)]]
'''György Bónis''' (January 5, 1914 – 1985) was a Hungarian jurist, researcher of Hungarian and European legal history.

György Bónis was born in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. His family name is probably of Italian or French origin.
He completed his [[secondary education]]  in Budapest, where he distinguished himself by winning 2 school award. He received his doctorate in jurisprudence in 1935 at the [[ELTE|Pázmány Péter University]]. After receiving his [[Doctorate|doctoral degree]], he spent a year in [[Great Britain]], attending the lectures of Prof. Holdsworth and Plucknett.
In the fall of 1940 he was appointed as a professor in the field of  "the history of Hungarian law" at the University of Kolozsvár (now [[Cluj-Napoca]], in Romania). From the beginning of 1940 through 1947 he regularly held lectures in this field of specialization as well as in other program areas. In 1947 all his goods have been confiscated, and he was constrained to leave Romania by the Romanian communist authorities.
In 1947 became ordinary professor of Hungarian and European [[legal history]] at the [[University of Szeged]].
His scholarly activities in Hungary  resulted in the publication of nearly 300 studies and articles, including many of his own books and textbooks, scholarly studies and essays, and hundreds of  periodical articles. In Hungary, his early works focused on [[penal law]], and later his research activity led him to deal with the history of European ius commune in Hungary. In 1964 he published his comprehensive volume entitled Einflüsse des römischen Rechts in Ungarn. 
He was visiting professor at [[University of Cambridge|the University of Cambridge]], and member of the European Academy of History.

The term '''9/11 humor''' refers to jokes, whether in print or otherwise, based on the events of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]] in [[New York City]], [[Virginia]], and [[Pennsylvania]].

A number of scholars have studied the ways in which humor has been used to deal with the trauma of the event,&lt;ref name="chron1"&gt;Brottman, Mikita (February 12, 2012). [http://chronicle.com/article/Whats-So-Funny-About-9-11-/130708/ What's So Funny About 9/11?], ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newfolk"&gt;Ellis, Bill (June 6, 2002).

[Cracking Up: American Humor in a Time of Conflict] (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; including researcher Bill Ellis who found that jokes about the attacks originating in the USA the day afterwards, and Giselinde Kuipers found jokes on Dutch websites a day later.&lt;ref name=kuipers&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuipers|first=Giselinde|date=March 2005|title="Where Was King Kong When We Needed Him?"

During a comedy roast for Hugh Hefner at the [[New York Friars' Club|Friars Club]] his 9/11 gag did not go over well with the crowd. One audience member at the club yelled out "Too soon!", which has since become a common response to jokes told in the immediate wake of tragedies. Gottfried then improvised and performed [[The Aristocrats (joke)|"The Aristocrats"]] routine, which released a great deal of tension and got rousing applause from the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.observer.com/node/37437 |title=The Guardian |accessdate=April 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010202828/http://www.observer.com/node/37437 |archivedate=October 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encyc1"&gt;Holt, Jim (August 27, 2011).

In contrast to these early jokes about 9/11, late-night comedy shows and humorous publications did not appear for several weeks following the attacks.&lt;ref name=kuipers/&gt; ''[[The Onion]]'', a satirical newspaper, cancelled the issue that had been scheduled to be released on September 11, 2001, and then returned to print with a special edition on September 26, 2001, which was devoted to the attacks. When the issue was released, the newspaper staff felt trepidation over making humor of such a tragic event. "Everyone thought this would be our last issue in print," according to one staff writer. Despite this expectation, ''The Onion'' staff was quickly inundated with comments from readers, the vast majority of which were positive.&lt;ref name=Onion&gt;{{cite news|last=Stableford|first=Dylan|title=Remembering The Onion's 9/11 issue: 'Everyone thought this would be our last issue in print'|url=https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/cutline/remembering-onion-9-11-issue-everyone-thought-last-162024809.html|accessdate=May 17, 2012|newspaper=The Cutline|publisher=Yahoo News|date=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they self-censored the article titled "America Stronger Than Ever, Say [[Pentagon Memorial|Quadragon]] Officials."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/fast-chat-onion-154021|title=Fast Chat: The Onion|date=2001-10-21|work=Newsweek|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first 9/11 jokes made by a major American comedian in the UK was one told by [[Joan Rivers]] in London in 2002. The joke concerned the widows of fire fighters killed in the attacks, who Rivers said would be disappointed if their husbands had been found alive as they would be forced to return money they had received in compensation for their late spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/news/ni0069193/ |title=Joan Rivers Jokes About 9/11 Victims |date=May 1, 2002 |publisher=IMDb |accessdate=June 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The joke received condemnation from [[Harold Schaitberger]], General President of the [[International Association of Fire Fighters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firehouse.com/news/10574582/iaff-rebuts-joan-rivers-humor-on-9-11 |title=IAFF Rebuts Joan Rivers Humor on 9-11 |accessdate=June 25, 2012 |publisher=International Association of Fire Fighters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
"The Zero" (2006) by [[Jess Walter]] is a post-911 satirical novel which features a New York City cop who shoots himself in the head and forgets it minutes later; his brain damage accounts for gaps in the story.&lt;ref&gt;Maslin, Janet (September 11, 2006). "[[New York Times]]: "After the Cataclysm, a Surreal Drift of Failing Senses" https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/11/books/11masl.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; The postmodern novel "[[United States of Banana]]" (2011) by Latin American author [[Giannina Braschi]] treats the entropic scenes of disaster on September 11 with black humor; the work describes New York City without the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]] as a mouth unwilling to laugh because it is missing its two front teeth.&lt;ref name="Evergreen"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.evergreenreview.com/128/review_us_of_banana.shtml|quotation=Challenging the fear and repression of dissent in the age of terror, Giannina Braschi wickedly brings a black humorous touch to the entropic scenes of disaster, writing from the estranged perspective of a Puerto Rican in New York.|title=Review of "United States of Banana"|date=2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402121638/http://www.evergreenreview.com/128/review_us_of_banana.shtml|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, comedian Billy Domineau uploaded a [[spec script]] to the Internet that he had written for ''[[Seinfeld]]'',&lt;ref name="Spec script"&gt;{{cite web|last=Domineau|first=Billy|title="The Twin Towers"|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B50l484pDaMobXI2Wk5CX0NMbkU/view|publisher=[[Google Docs]]|date=August 2, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had aired its last episode in 1998, set in New York during the days after the attacks. He said later that it had started when he suggested "a 9/11 episode of ''Seinfeld''" to a student as an example of "an exercise in bad taste" for a class.&lt;ref name="EW Seinfled script article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kickham|first=Dylan|title=Seinfeld 9/11 spec script author says episode should've existed, but couldn't|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/08/04/seinfeld-911-spec-script-author-interview|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=August 4, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his episode, the show's four main characters follow plotlines typical of them, all related to the attacks: [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry]] becomes convinced that dust from the fallen towers is contaminating his food; [[Elaine Benes|Elaine]], initially relieved that she won't have to break up with a boyfriend who worked at the Twin Towers, finds herself engaged to him when he unexpectedly survives; [[George Costanza|George]] basks in the glory after he is mistaken for a hero who rescued people, and [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]] attempts to recover the high-quality [[box cutter]] he loaned to [[Mohammed Atta]]. Popular [[list of Seinfeld minor characters|minor characters]], such as George's parents and [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]], also make appearances. "[It] is indeed in bad taste, but it perfectly captures the self-obsessed way these characters would handle such a crisis," wrote ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name="Seinfeld script"&gt;{{cite news|last=Czajkowski|first=Elise|title=Seinfeld 9/11 script: a work of genius or just pretty, pretty good?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/05/seinfeld-911-script-billy-domineau|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=August 5, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In animation==
In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Back to the Pilot]]", broadcast in November 2011, Brian and Stewie take a trip back in time during which Brian tips off his past self about 9/11 so that the old him can play hero and stop the terrorist attacks. This causes [[George W. Bush]] not to be re-elected, meaning a [[Second American Civil War|Second Civil War]] starts that leads to nuclear attacks on the Eastern Seaboard. A ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' critic wrote of the episode, "It sounds custom-made for a 'too soon' label, and it probably is. But avid ''Family Guy'' viewers live for "too soon" moments, no matter how sensitive the material."&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/11/14/did-family-guys-911-satire-go-too-far-for-a-laugh/ |title=Did Family Guy's 9/11 Satire Go Too Far for a Laugh? |publisher=''Time'' |accessdate=November 14, 2011 |date=November 14, 2011 |last=Pous |first=Terri}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other news organizations, including Aly Semigran of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', also thought the show had gone too far with the reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/11/14/family-guy-911-episode/ |title='Family Guy' 9/11 gag: Did they finally go too far this time? |publisher=''Entertainment Weekly'' |accessdate=November 14, 2011 |date=November 14, 2011 |last=Semigran |first=Aly}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]'' also commented that it "squeaked past the Fox standards and practices department but is sure to raise as many eyebrows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/11/family-guy-on-911-attack-let-it-happen/ |title='Family Guy' On 9/11 Attack: "Let It Happen" |website=Deadline Hollywood |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |accessdate=November 14, 2011 |date=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, perhaps reflecting how the acceptability to mainstream broadcasters of jokes referencing the 9/11 attacks has evolved only gradually, the DVD release of the earlier [[Family Guy (season 5)|season five]] ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Meet the Quagmires]]", first broadcast in 2007, contained an extended scene which was removed from the episode as first broadcast. In the deleted scene, while [[time travel|traveling]] in time back to 1980s Quahog with Peter, Brian is confronted by the boyfriend of a woman he has been hitting on. In response to the boyfriend's challenge that he will fight Brian 'anywhere, any time', Brian invites the man to meet him "On top of the World Trade Center, September 11th 2001 at 8am", to which the boyfriend replies "I will be there pal. You think I'll forget, but I won't!".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0945076/quotes  imdb.com], Family Guy: Meet the Quagmires (2007), Quotes. Retrieved July 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Family Guy (season 7)|season seven]] episode "[[Baby Not On Board]]" features a scene in which the Griffin family visits [[Ground Zero]], which Peter erroneously believes is "where the first guy got [[AIDS]]."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpP7b2lUxVE&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Family Guy (season 6)|season six]] episode "[[Back to the Woods (Family Guy)|Back to the Woods]]" had Peter committing [[identity theft]] against a fictionalized [[James Woods]], in retaliation of him doing the same and ruining his life. Peter appears on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' proving he is Woods, promoting a comedy film based on the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetvcritic.org/reviews/comedies/family-guy/season-15/back-to-the-woods/|title=Episode 9 - Back to the Woods|publisher=The TV Critic|author=Pierson, Robin|accessdate=September 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To improve the chance of an Oscar award, a 9/11 joke was cut from [[Jean Dujardin]]'s 2012 comedy film ''[[The Players (film)|The Players]]''. The deleted scene featured a man [[seduction|seducing]] a woman in a New York apartment while an aircraft crashes into the World Trade Center in the background.

==In advertising==
In the days before the 15th anniversary of the attacks in 2016, Miracle Mattress of [[San Antonio, Texas]], briefly ran a commercial promoting a [[Discounts and allowances|sale]] themed around the occasion. In it the daughter of the store's owner, in conversation with two employees who stood behind her, explained how the store was recalling the Twin Towers' collapse by selling all its inventory at the price of [[Bed size|twin-sized]] mattresses for the weekend with the slogan "Twin Towers, Twin Price". At the end of the ad, she inadvertently pushed the two employees into twin piles of mattresses behind her, one of which was topped with the American flag; both collapsed. After briefly expressing shock and horror, she turned to the camera and said "We'll never forget".&lt;ref name="Miracle Mattress ad"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Jamie Narrientos |date=September 8, 2016 |title=Mattress company airs offensive 9/11 commercial|medium=Online video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmM-2gj5Gc|access-date=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company soon pulled the ad, but copies were saved and uploaded to the Internet, where it and Miracle became the subject of intense and vociferous criticism. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said it "might be most offensive commercial ever". Its [[Yelp!]] and [[Facebook]] pages filled with disparaging comments and calls for boycotts; the store itself also received [[death threat]]. Owner Mike Bonnano, whose daughter had, as the chain's head of marketing, conceived the commercials and starred in it, apologized profusely but eventually decided to close the San Antonio location "indefinitely" pending disciplinary measures and donations to the [[9/11 Foundation]].  Miracle Mattress reopened a few days later.&lt;ref name="EW mattress ad story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hibberd|first=James|title=9/11-themed mattress ad might be most offensive commercial ever|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/09/09/911-mattress-ad|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 9, 2016|accessdate=September 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online==
Memes have become a rather popular way of distributing jokes about 9/11. A lot of these memes play with or make fun of [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] such as "Bush did 9/11" or "jet fuel can't melt steel beams." There have also been viral Vine videos that joke about fictional characters or other famous people doing the attacks. In these vines, the creators have a clip of them, or something they throw, or perhaps  an aircraft they fly, and then cut to footage of the planes hitting the Twin Towers (mostly [[United Airlines Flight 175|Flight 175]] hitting the South Tower). This makes fun of that character or real person, saying "(blank) did 9/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hess |first=Amanda |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/users/2015/07/teenagers_and_9_11_trutherism_jokes_how_these_memes_became_a_phenomenon.html |title=Teenagers and 9/11 trutherism jokes: How these memes became a phenomenon.|date=July 6, 2015 |work=Slate Magazine |accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Israel Gutman''' ({{lang-he-n|ישראל גוטמן}}; 20 May 1923&amp;nbsp;– 1 October 2013) was a [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-born]] Israeli historian and a survivor of [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/ringelbum/ringelblum_gutman.asp |title="Let The World Read And Know" The Oneg Shabbat Archives |publisher=.yadvashem.org |date=2010-02-16 |accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the immediate post-war period, he joined the [[Jewish Brigade]] in Italy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; In 1946, he immigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]] and joined [[Kibbutz]] [[Lehavot HaBashan]], where he raised a family.

[[Image:JMF February 2011.jpg|thumb|right|John Miles Foley]]
'''John Miles Foley''' (January 22, 1947 – May 3, 2012) was a scholar of comparative [[oral tradition]], particularly [[medieval literature|medieval]] and [[Old English literature]], [[Homer]] and [[Serbian literature|Serbian epic]]. He was the founder of the academic journal [[Oral Tradition (journal)|''Oral Tradition'']] and the Center for Studies in Oral Tradition at the [[University of Missouri]], where he was Curators' Professor of Classical Studies and English and W. H. Byler Endowed Chair in the Humanities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/texts/scholars.htm#Foley Visiting Scholars | Textual Studies Program - University of Washington&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Foley was born January 22, 1947, in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}  He received his bachelor's degree at [[Colgate University]] in 1969, with majors in [[Physics]], [[Mathematics]] and [[Chemistry]]. He completed his Masters in [[English Literature]] at the University of Massachusetts/Amherst in 1971 before completing the Ph.D. there in English and [[Comparative Literature]] (1974).{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Career==
Following his doctoral studies, Foley undertook [[fieldwork]] in [[Yugoslavia]], confirming and extending prior research on living oral traditions by [[Milman Parry]] and [[Albert Lord]]. Based on this fieldwork, he continued the work of [[Francis P. Magoun]] in applying findings to other [[ethnolinguistic]] areas, as well as refining the theory of [[Oral-Formulaic Composition]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

After receiving his doctorate, Foley was assistant professor of English at [[Emory University]] until 1979, when he became associate professor at the  [[University of Missouri]], where he became regular professor in 1983 and stayed for the remainder of his career.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} Stints at other universities included an appointment as visiting professor at the [[University of Belgrade]] (1980) and visiting fellow at [[Harvard University]] (1976–1977, 1980–1981). He directed summer institutes for teachers for the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] in 1987, 1989, 1991, 1992 and 1994.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

He gave more than 250 invited lectures throughout the United States as well as in [[China]], [[India]], [[Russia]], [[Mongolia]], [[Japan]], throughout [[Africa]] and [[Europe]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Miles Foley |url=http://journal.oraltradition.org/authors/show/268 |work=Oral Tradition |date= |accessdate=2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foley was awarded grants and fellowships from the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]], the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], the [[Fulbright]] Program, the [[Mellon Foundation]], and other institutions, and was a fellow of the Finnish Folklore Society and the [[American Folklore Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Haessig  | first = Dola  | title = John Foley receives award from Modern Language Association  | work = Research and the Arts  | accessdate = 2013-01-10  | date = 2006-01-11  | url = http://rcp.missouri.edu/articles/2006/foleyMLAaward.html  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100605040952/http://rcp.missouri.edu/articles/2006/foleyMLAaward.html  | archivedate = 2010-06-05  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to providing the infrastructure for the comparatively new academic discipline of oral tradition by means of organizing conferences, producing the first bibliography,&lt;ref&gt;''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography''. New York: Garland 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; history and methodological guide&lt;ref&gt;''The Theory of Oral Composition: History and Methodology''. Bloomington:IUP 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and classroom textbook &lt;ref&gt;(ed.)''Teaching Oral Traditions''. New York: Modern Language Association 1998&lt;/ref&gt; on the subject, his principal contributions involved the study of oral traditional performance in the field, and the application of those observations both to ancient texts and to the emerging [[secondary orality]] of the Internet.

He taught in the departments of Classical Studies (of which he was chair from 1996–1999), including both literature and language, English ( Anglo-Saxon language and Beowulf), and German and Russian Studies (Slavic languages and literature).&lt;ref name="missouri1"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Miles Foley |work=University of Missouri, Department of Classical Studies |url=http://classics.missouri.edu/people/foley.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720000154/http://classics.missouri.edu/people/foley.shtml |archivedate=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he had been an adjunct professor of anthropology since 1992.

Foley founded the academic journal ''Oral Tradition'' in 1986, converting it to an [[open access]] publishing model in 2006.&lt;ref name=roth /&gt;
He also founded  and directed two academic centers, the Center for the Studies in Oral Tradition (launched in 1986) and the Center for eResearch (launched in 2005),&lt;ref name=roth&gt;{{cite news|first=LuAnne|last= Roth|title=Between OT and IT: A visit with John Miles Foley, Professor, Departments of Classical Studies and English |work=Syndicate Mizzou|date=April 28, 2010|url=http://syndicate.missouri.edu/articles/show/121}}&lt;/ref&gt; which fosters cross-disciplinary internet-related research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journal.oraltradition.org/issues/22ii/authors |title=Oral Tradition Journal |publisher=Journal.oraltradition.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote or edited twenty books, and authored more than 160 scholarly articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journal.oraltradition.org/issues/26ii/garner2 |title=Oral Tradition Journal |publisher=Journal.oraltradition.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]] did a retrospective of his work in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Choice, 39, i (September 2001): 64-65&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he edited three series of books (''Lord Studies in Oral Tradition'', published by Garland, ''Voices in Performance and Text'', by the University of Illinois Press, and ''Poetics of Orality and Literacy'', with the University of Notre Dame Press).&lt;ref name="missouri1"/&gt;

Foley was most recently the Academic Director for the Oral Traditions program at the Graduate Institute.

Foley retired from the University of Missouri in 2011, and died May 3, 2012 at the age of 65.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hackel |first=Karee |url=http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2012/05/08/mu-professor-dedicated-education-knowledge/ |title=MU professor dedicated to education, knowledge |publisher=Columbia Missourian |date=2012-05-03 |accessdate=2012-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119143653/http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2012/05/08/mu-professor-dedicated-education-knowledge/ |archivedate=2013-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in 1895 in [[Temanggung Regency|Parakan]], [[Central Java]], Dutch East Indies (now [[Indonesia]]), Liem Thian Joe received his earliest education at local Malay and Javanese schools.&lt;ref name="Coppel (1976)" /&gt; He subsequently attended a Hokkien school for ten years, then the Tiong Hoa Hak Tong in Ngadirejo, a school founded and run by the Confucian organization [[Tiong Hoa Hwee Koan]].&lt;ref name="Coppel (1976)" /&gt;

Despite his talent for writing, Liem initially worked as a trader in Ngadirejo.&lt;ref name="Coppel (1976)" /&gt; He began his writing career in the early 1920s as a journalist for ''Warna Warta'', a Semarang daily, and possibly also for the [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]-based newspaper ''Perniagaan''.&lt;ref name="Suryadinata (2015)" /&gt; In the early 1930s, Liem joined the editorial board of another Semarang daily ''Djawa Tengah'' and its sister monthly ''Djawa Tengah Review''.&lt;ref name="Suryadinata (2015)" /&gt; Around the same time, Liem began - in 1938 - to edit yet another Semarang monthly, ''Mimbar Melajoe'', and also contributed to the prominent, Batavia-based weekly ''[[Sin Po]]''.&lt;ref name="Suryadinata (2015)" /&gt;

Liem wrote ''Riwajat Semarang'' as a series of articles for ''Djawa Tengah Review'' from March 1931 until July 1933, before having it published in book form by Ho Kim Yoe in 1933.&lt;ref name="Coppel (1976)" /&gt; In the book, he coined the term ''[[Cabang Atas]]'', Malay for 'upper branch', to describe the ''baba bangsawan'' or the Chinese gentry of colonial Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Liem (2004)"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Liem |first1=Thian Joe |title=Riwayat Semarang |date=2004 |publisher=Hasta Wahana |isbn=9789799695215 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U6xwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=liem+riwajat+semarang&amp;dq=liem+riwajat+semarang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB-6O85NjeAhUJWX0KHQZ5DoMQ6AEIKjAA |accessdate=16 November 2018 |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Riwajat Semarang'', while focused on the history of Semarang's Chinese community, is also an invaluable source for the history of Central Java, particularly of Semarang, since Liem was still able to access the now lost archives of the ''[[Kong Koan]]'' (or the 'Chinese Council') of Semarang, the city's peak Chinese government body.&lt;ref name="Coppel (1976)" /&gt;

He is also the anonymous author of ''Boekoe Peringetan Tiong Hoa Siang Hwee 1907-1937'', an anniversary book of Semarang's Chinese Chamber of Commerce, published in 1937.&lt;ref name="Coppel (1976)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suryadinata (2015)" /&gt; Liem's other historical works include ''Pusaka Tionghoa'' of 1952 and the unpublished ''Riwajat Kian Gwan'', a history of Southeast Asia's largest conglomerate at the time, [[Kian Gwan]], completed in 1959.&lt;ref name="Coppel (1976)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suryadinata (2015)" /&gt;

Liem died in Semarang in February 1962.&lt;ref name="Suryadinata (2015)" /&gt;

The following content contains the tentative '''list of the most watched television interviews''', with the corresponding peak viewership (or ratings share) records, the corresponding year of such broadcast, and the mentioned media research organizations tallying viewership records.

On February 10, 1993, [[Oprah Winfrey]] sat down with [[Michael Jackson]] for what would become the most-watched interview in television history. Jackson, an intensely private artist, had not given an interview in 14 years. The event was broadcast live from Jackson's [[Neverland Ranch]] and was watched by 90 million people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/entertainment/Oprah-Reflects-on-Her-Interview-with-Michael-Jackson/1 |title=Oprah Reflects on Her Interview with Michael Jackson |author= |date=September 16, 2009 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Louise Gill''' is the David Benedict Professor of Classics and Philosophy at [[Brown University]].&lt;ref name=cv&gt;{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=https://research.brown.edu/pdf/10037.pdf?nocache=680322175|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|title=The Directory of Research and Researchers at Brown: Mary Louise Gill|url=https://research.brown.edu/myresearch/Mary_Louise_Gill|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Her work primarily focuses on [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and other (primarily Greek) ancient philosophers.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;  She is the author of three books: ''Aristotle on Substance: The Paradox of Unity'' (1991,) ''Plato: Parmenides'' (1994,) and ''Philosophos: Plato’s Missing Dialogue'' (2012,) and has previously served as the Chair of the Faculty of Brown University, the Chair of Classics at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and on the editorial boards of numerous journals and books.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

==Education and career==
Gill received a bachelor's in religion in 1972 from [[Barnard College]] and a master's in religion from [[Columbia University]] in 1974.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; She received a second bachelor's from [[Cambridge University]] in classics and ancient philosophy in 1976, and a master's and doctorate in classics and ancient philosophy from Cambridge, both in 1981.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; Gill acted as an instructor of classics at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] from 1979 to 1981 before accepting an appointment as Assistant Professor of Classics and Philosophy there from 1981 to 1988.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; She was promoted to associate professor in 1988, full professor in 1994, and chaired the department from 1994 to 1997.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; Gill moved from Pittsburgh to [[Brown University]] as a professor of philosophy and classics in 2001, and was appointed the David Benedict Professor of Classics and Philosophy in 2013.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;  In addition to her permanent appointments, Gill has also held a variety of visiting positions, including at [[Dartmouth College]], [[Stanford University]], [[UCLA]], [[UC Davis]], [[Harvard University]], and the [[University of Paris]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

==Research areas and publications==
Gill's work primarily focuses on [[ancient Greek philosophy]], especially [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;  She has authored two books and one extensive introduction - ''Aristotle on Substance: The Paradox of Unity'' (1991), the long introduction to ''Plato: Parmenides'' (1994,) and ''Philosophos: Plato’s Missing Dialogue'' (2012.)&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; ''Aristotle on Substance: The Paradox of Unity'' attempts to resolve the problem posed by the juxtaposition of Aristotle's requirement that primary substances have conceptual unity with the composite nature of living organisms.&lt;ref name=aos1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Halper|first=Edward C.|title=Aristotle on Substance: The Paradox of Unity (review)|journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy|year=1992|volume=30|issue=3|pages=444–446|doi=10.1353/hph.1992.0047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Philosophos: Plato’s Missing Dialogue'', Gill attempts to explain the absence of the ''Philosopher'', a dialogue which Plato repeatedly mentions in ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', and ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]]'', but which no record exists of Plato actually having written.&lt;ref name=pp1/&gt; Previous suggestions for the absence of the ''Philosopher'' include a lack of time in Plato's later years, it forming one of Plato's [[Plato#Unwritten doctrines|unwritten doctrines]], or it being unnecessary because the ''Sophist'' had included much of its intended content.&lt;ref name=pp1/&gt;  Gill suggests a fourth alternative - that Plato intentionally avoided writing the ''Philosopher'' with the intent that someone who had read well ''Theaetetus'', ''Sophist'', and ''Statesman'' could use the pedagogical clues contained in those dialogues to reconstruct the missing ''Philosopher'' (while becoming philosophers themselves in the process.)&lt;ref name=pp1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jong Hwan|title=Philosophos: Plato’s Missing Dialogue by Mary Louise Gill|journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy|year=2013|volume=51|issue=4|pages=675–676|doi=10.1353/hph.2013.0082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gill's explanation of the ''Philosopher'' has been criticized for relying excessively on the assumption that all of Plato's later philosophy was strongly Aristotelian, but her close analyses of many of the significant passages in the three dialogues her book covers has been lauded as well worthwhile.&lt;ref name=pp2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aufderheide|first=J.|title=Philosophos: Plato's Missing Dialogue|journal=The Philosophical Quarterly|date=22 October 2013|volume=64|issue=254|pages=154–156|doi=10.1093/pq/pqt001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Museum of Warsaw''' ({{lang-pl|Muzeum Warszawy}}) (in 1948–2014 ''Historical Museum of Warsaw'', {{lang-pl|Muzeum Historyczne m.st. Warszawy}}) is a museum in the [[Old Town Market Place, Warsaw|Old Town Market Place]] in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. It was established in 1936.

== History of the museum ==

The facility was established in 1936 as the Museum of Old Warsaw. It was then housed in three buildings purchased by the municipality in the market square. The museum, along with the collection, was destroyed during the [[Warsaw Uprising]] during World War II. After the war, the museum was reopened under its current name and buildings for it were rebuilt in the years 1948-1954 in the context of the unprecedented reconstruction of historic Warsaw.

In 2010-2012 the eleven houses of the museum were renovated with the help of [[EEA and Norway Grants|Norwegian funding]].

In April 2014 museum changed its name to ''Museum of Warsaw''.

== Activity ==

The various collections in the fields of archeology, painting, graphics, iconography, sculpture, decorative arts, numismatics and architectural drawings, now exceed 250 000 objects. Until the start of the renovations in 2010 there was available exhibitions showing seven centuries of Warsaw history, from its foundation to the present day.

In addition to its exhibitions, the museum has a strong record of publishing (including a Clio Award in 2010 for its series of "Library of Warsaw"), as well as numerous publications on their own collections and the history of Warsaw. They organize lessons and competitions for schools and conferences and participate in significant events such as: a [[Long Night of Museums|Night at the Museum]], the [[Science Picnic]] of [[Polskie Radio|Polish Radio]] and the [[Copernicus Science Centre]], the Festival of Science, and the [[University of the Third Age]]. It is also a co-producer of documentary films devoted to the capital.

Revitalization of the museum was completed in 2012.

'''Nicolae Petrescu-Comnen''' ({{IPA-ro|nikoˈla.e peˈtresku komˈnen}}; [[Francization|Gallicized]] as '''Petresco-Comnène''', '''Petrescu-Comnène''' or '''N. P. Comnène''', born '''Nicolae Petrescu'''; August 24, 1881 – December 8, 1958) was a [[Romania]]n diplomat, politician and social scientist, who served as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] in the [[Miron Cristea]] cabinet (between May 1938 and January 31, 1939). He debuted in France as a public lecturer and author of several books on political history, then returned to Romania as a judge and member of the [[University of Bucharest]] faculty. Comnen spent most of World War I in Switzerland, earning respect at home and abroad for his arguments in favor of [[Romanian nationalism|nationalism]], his publicizing of the [[Greater Romania]]n cause, and especially for his support of the Romanian community in [[Dobruja]]. During the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], he was dispatched to [[Hungarian Republic (1919–20)|Hungary]], proposing political settlements that would have made the [[Treaty of Trianon]] more palatable to Hungarian conservatives. Also noted as an eccentric who published poetry, he was often ridiculed for his claim to a [[Byzantine bureaucracy and aristocracy|Byzantine aristocratic]] descent from the [[Komnenos]].

Comnen returned to serve briefly in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Romanian Assembly of Deputies]], during which time he became a prominent anti-socialist. He was a [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal]] and close to that party's leadership, before embarking on a full-time diplomatic career, originally as Romania's envoy to Switzerland and to the [[League of Nations]] (1923–1927). He had a steady climb during the early interwar, with alternating missions in [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]] and at the [[Holy See]]. His activity centered on debilitating [[Hungarian irredentism]], and, progressively, on the easing of tensions between Romania and the [[Soviet Union]]. As Romania's ambassador to [[Nazi Germany]], Comnen preserved a neutralist line, recognizing Romania's dependence on German industry while seeking to expand cooperation with France and Britain.

Comnen was assigned to lead Foreign Affairs during the early stages of [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]'s authoritarian regime. His ministerial term was highly turbulent, overlapping with the expansion of Nazi power, Western [[appeasement]], and a sudden deterioration of [[Romania–Russia relations|Romanian–Soviet relations]]. Comnen recognized the ''[[Anschluss]]'', helped "liquidate" the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Abyssinian question]], and tried to obtain guarantees from Romania's hostile neighbors at [[Bled agreement (1938)|Bled]] and [[Salonika Agreement|Salonika]]. A full crisis followed the [[Munich Agreement]], during which Comnen worked to preserve both a [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakian state]] and the [[Little Entente]]. He tacitly gave the [[Soviet Air Forces]] access to Romania's airspace, and refused to participate in a partition of [[Carpathian Ruthenia]].

Comnen was ultimately deposed by Carol—allegedly, because he had questioned the king's rationale for repressing the rival [[Iron Guard]]—and replaced with [[Grigore Gafencu]]. Again dispatched to the Holy See, he was sacked by a [[National Legionary State|Guardist government]] after Carol's downfall in 1940. He never returned home, but remained in [[Florence]], a supporter of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and agent of the [[Romanian National Committee]]. As such, Comnen worked with Gafencu in the diaspora movement against [[Communist Romania]]. Earning accolades for his new contributions as a humanitarian, he published works of recollections and studies in diplomatic history. In his last years before his death in Florence, he had turned to promoting a [[pan-European identity]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Nicolae Petrescu was born in [[Bucharest]] on August 24, 1884, the son of a public servant (or magistrate) and his schoolteacher wife.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 331; Vițalaru, p. 347&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Constantinide"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Noti Constantinide]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234817/http://www.memoria.ro/?location=view_article&amp;id=781&amp;from_name=cautare&amp;from=bG9jYXRpb249c2VhcmNoJmtleXdvcmRzPXBldHJlc2N1LWNvbW5lbiZ4PTAmeT0w ''Amintiri''], at ''Memoria.ro''&lt;/ref&gt; Baptized [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]],&lt;ref&gt;Vițalaru, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; he was part-[[Greeks in Romania|Greek]]: his maternal grandmother, Ecaterina, was the last descendant of the Greek family Comninò.&lt;ref&gt;Potra, p. 607&lt;/ref&gt; Also through his mother, hailing from the Cernovodeanu clan, the future diplomat belonged to the [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar nobility]],&lt;ref&gt;Mihai Sorin Rădulescu, "Sur l'aristocratie roumaine de l'entre-deux-guerres", in ''The New Europe College Yearbook 1996–1997''. p. 352. Bucharest: New Europe College, 2000. {{ISBN|973-98624-4-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was an uncle of the historian Dan Cernovodeanu.&lt;ref name="mdsbm99–100"&gt;Mihai Demetriade, Silviu B. Moldovan, "Ion Mitucă, de la rezistență la disidență", in ''Caietele CNSAS'', Nr. 2/2008, pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; His collaborator and subordinate [[Noti Constantinide]] further argues that Petrescu was of [[Roma minority in Romania|Romany]] descent, "a true, purebred, Gypsy" and "highly unusual character".&lt;ref name="Constantinide"/&gt; Having studied at the [[University of Bucharest]] and the [[University of Paris]],&lt;ref name="Constantinide"/&gt; he took a doctorate in Law and Political Science at the latter, and began his career as an [[Ilfov County]] judge in 1906. He worked as a lawyer from 1911 to 1916, while also teaching economics at Bucharest University.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 331–333; Potra, p. 607. See also Rostovsky &amp; Forter, p. 317; Vițalaru, p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; He was at the center of political life from his Paris years, when he joined the Romanian Students' Circle. He lectured with the latter at Voltaire Coffeehouse, appearing alongside some of the country's future statesmen and scholars: [[Nicolae Titulescu]], [[Ion G. Duca]], [[Dimitrie Drăghicescu]], and [[Toma Dragu]].&lt;ref&gt;Liliana Beu, "Câteva repere privind originile și familia omului politic I. G. Duca", in ''Buridava'', Vol. V, 2007, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:(Petrescu-)Comnen family coat of arms.svg|thumb|200px|Coat of arms used by Petrescu-Comnen]]
During that period, he changed his surname to ''Petrescu-Comnen'', thus claiming lineage from the [[Komnenos]] family of [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine Emperors]] (he also claimed to be related to the [[House of Bonaparte|Bonapartes]]).&lt;ref name="Constantinide"/&gt; The change was made official by his father in 1903, and later backed by a questionable family tree and heraldry, but recognized during his induction into the [[Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George]].&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 331–332&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ift126"&gt;Sorin Iftimi, ''Vechile blazoane vorbesc. Obiecte armoriate din colecții ieșene'', p. 126. Iași: Palatul Culturii, 2014.  {{ISBN|978-606-8547-02-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petrescu's views on his family's heritage were a frequent topic of ridicule among foreign diplomats (puns on his name included the French-language ''Petrescu-Quand même''—"Petrescu-All the Same", and the generic "Nicolae Perhaps-Comnen").&lt;ref name="Constantinide"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vițalaru, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Andrei Pippidi]] sees the Byzantine claim as entirely spurious, "snobbish", "unjustly decreasing the value of [his] character."&lt;ref name="apcasă"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Pippidi]], [http://dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/bordeie-si-obiceie/articol/o-casa-de-ministru "SOS București. O casă de ministru"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 393, August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Genealogist Dumitru Năstase proposes that the Petrescus were in fact only attached to the village of [[Prundu|Comeni]], a name later corrupted into ''Comneni'', then ''Comnen''.&lt;ref name="ift126"/&gt; The "bewildering" Byzantine pedigree was also ridiculed by the left-wing satirist [[Petre Pandrea]], who noted that, beyond his "princely obsession", Comnen was a "fundamentally decent man."&lt;ref name="pandr"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Petre Pandrea]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20111223105651/http://atelier.liternet.ro/articol/9729/Petre-Pandrea/Brancusi-Pravila-de-la-Craiova.html ''Brâncuși. Pravila de la Craiova'' (fragment)], Atelier LiterNet, August 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Comnen's early work included poetry: in July 1904, his patriotic [[ode]] to [[Iosif Vulcan]] was carried by the magazine ''[[Familia (magazine)|Familia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Homagiu marelui român Vulcan", in ''[[Familia (magazine)|Familia]]'', Nr. 25–26, 1904, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; According to Constantinide, young Petrescu authored a volume of poems which he signed as ''Petrescu-[[D'Artagnan]]''.&lt;ref name="Constantinide"/&gt; He is known to have published, as Petresco-Comnène, the collection ''Il était une fois'' ("Once upon a Time", 1904). Comprising [[Parnassianism|Parnassian]] verse,&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; it received a lukewarm review from the staff critic at ''[[Le Figaro]]'': "the work of a real poet", it nevertheless contained "pages that are quite needlessly bizarre".&lt;ref&gt;Philippe-Emmanuel Glaser, "Petite Chronique des Lettres", in ''[[Le Figaro]]'', April 15, 1904, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; For a while, this aspect of his literary activity merged with his scholarly work. On June 4, 1905, ''[[Le Journal du Dimanche]]'' noted his "strange conference" about [[Albert Samain]], which ended with readings from Samain's works by a group of actresses.&lt;ref&gt;Sales, "La Semaine Dramatique", in ''[[Le Journal du Dimanche]]'', No. 3340, June 1905, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;

Comnen also contributed a study of early Romanian jurisprudence (1902), and a monograph on the [[history of the Jews in Romania]] (1905). The latter earned him the [[Romanian Academy]]'s [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]] award, and special praise from the scholar [[A. D. Xenopol]].&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; He continued in the fields of law and sociology, with a succession of tracts and lectures: ''Ziua de 8 ore de muncă'' ("The 8-hour Day", 1906), ''Accidente profesionale'' ("Work-related Accidents", 1907), ''Câteva considerațiuni asupra socialismului și asupra roadelor sale'' ("Some Musings on Socialism and Its Results", 1909), ''Studiu asupra intervențiunii statului între capital și muncă'' ("A Review of State Intervention between Capital and Labor", 1910).&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 332–333; Vițalaru, p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; These contributions detail Comnen's take on the [[Labor movement in Romania|local labor movement]], showing him as a [[social liberalism|social liberal]] who fully embraced unionization.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Rizescu, "De la emanciparea muncii la protecția socială: politica reprezentării profesionale în România la începutul secolului XX", in ''Polis'', Issue 4 (14), 2016, pp. 178, 179&lt;/ref&gt; ''Câteva considerațiuni'' was awarded another Academy prize, and again received a good review from Xenopol.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Petrescu showed himself to be staunchly against [[Hungarian nationalism]], his wife, Antoinette von Benedek,&lt;ref name="apcasă"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LFmar"&gt;E. Delaroche, "Le Monde &amp; la Ville. Mariages", in ''[[Le Figaro]]'', August 4, 1912, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mhill"&gt;"Roumanian {{sic}} Art at Maryhill", in ''The Othello Outlook'', March 25, 1998, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; may have been of [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarian]] origin—allegedly, he had her adopted by an impoverished count in [[Trieste]], as a means for the family to inherit a formal title.&lt;ref name="Constantinide"/&gt; Other sources simply list her as a Triestine [[Austrians|Austrian]].&lt;ref&gt;Pavlowitch, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; They were married on August 4, 1912, at the [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Paris|Russian Cathedral of Paris]].&lt;ref name="LFmar"/&gt; The couple already had a son, Raymond-Alexis, born 1908, and a daughter, Elsa-Irène, born 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Vițalaru, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pandrea, neither of the Comnen children shared their father's "obsession". He described both as "my friends", "sensible, unpretentious kids".&lt;ref name="pandr"/&gt;

===World War I and aftermath===
Petrescu-Comnen's career took an upward turn after [[Romania in World War I|Romania entered World War I]], initially as a noted campaigner for the cause of [[Greater Romania]]; he was also tasked with explaining [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Romania's capitulation]]. According to Duca, Comnen, "whose precarious health had exiled to Switzerland", matched and surpassed Drăghicescu's similar work in France. He displayed "exquisite skills as a propagandist".&lt;ref name="igd144"&gt;[[Ion G. Duca]], ''Amintiri politice, II'', p. 144. Munich: Jon Dumitru-Verlag, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Comnen contributed to the cause from a Swiss sanitarium, where he was recovering, hoping to carry forward the work of his deceased friend, [[Aurel Popovici]]. With articles in ''Le Genevois'', and with tracts such as ''Notes sur la guerre roumaine'' ("Notes on the Romanian War"), he complained about the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] "sacrificing Romania" after the [[October Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; French scholar Marcel Emerit found his a biased, "unilateral", perspective, containing "a lively condemnation" of the [[Russian Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Emerit, "Partie bibliographique. II. Autour de la guerre. Pétain (général), ''Le Drame roumain (1916–1918)''", in ''[[Revue d'Histoire Moderne]]'', Vol. 8, Issue 6, 1933, p. 512&lt;/ref&gt; Comnen also contributed an ethnographic overview of [[Dobruja]] (''La Dobrogea''), just as the region was being absorbed into a [[Greater Bulgaria]]. [[Georges Lacour-Gayet]], who presented the work at the [[Romanian Academy]], noted that the "savant work" of "truth and justice", had exposed the practices of [[Bulgarization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Lacour-Gayet]], "Rapports verbaux et communications diverses. ''La Dobrogea (Dobroudja)'', de M. N. P. Comnène", in ''Séances et Travaux de l'Académie des Sciences Morales. Comptes Rendus'', Vol. 78, Issue 7, 1918, pp. 404–405&lt;/ref&gt;

Comnen received international attention, as well as collaborations from [[Emil Isac]], [[Constantin Flondor]], and [[Ghiță Popp]].&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 333–334&lt;/ref&gt; He also approached the [[Czechoslovak National Council]] and established a working relationship with [[Edvard Beneš]].&lt;ref name="igd144"/&gt; Eventually settling with his family in [[Bern]],&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; but was delegated to [[Geneva]] by [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]], and was later one of Romania's envoys to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. While in Paris, he published the bilingual atlas ''Roumania through the Ages. La terre roumaine a travers les âges''.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this time that he became the target of criticism from the far left—communist writer [[Panait Istrati]], who also resided in Switzerland, alleged that Brătianu's delegates [[Vasile Lucaciu]] and Petrescu-Comnen were demagogues, preparing the annexation of [[Transylvania]] to the "[[satrap]] yoke" of the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mircea Iorgulescu]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20071008065758/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=626&amp;nr=2003-10-07 "Istrati în Elveția (II)"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 708, September–October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Petrescu-Comnen's input was valued by the Transylvanian delegate, [[Alexandru Vaida-Voevod]], who kept him as an adviser during meetings with [[Robert Lansing]]. By then, Comnen had befriended Lansing's nephew, [[Allen Dulles]].&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 333–334&lt;/ref&gt; 

At this stage, the collapse of [[Austria-Hungary]] had ensured the [[union of Transylvania with Romania]]; it also sparked a [[Hungarian–Romanian War]], in which Romania faced a [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]. According to Comnen's own account, he met with a deputation of Hungarian conservatives and liberals, including [[Gyula Andrássy the Younger|Count Andrássy]], [[Alfred III, Prince of Windisch-Grätz|Alftred Windisch-Grätz]] and [[Mihály Károlyi]], who demanded that Romania back their anti-communist government, based in [[Szeged]], and provide support to the "White Guards".&lt;ref name="uscăt"&gt;{{es icon}} Jorge Uscătescu, [http://hemeroteca.sevilla.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1957/03/16/013.html "Primera derrota del comunismo"], in ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC de Sevilla]]'', March 16, 1957, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1919, Comnen was contacted by another delegation, representing the [[Hungarian Republic (1919–20)|Hungarian Republic]]. Comprising [[István Bethlen]], [[Miklós Bánffy]], and [[Pál Teleki]], it asked for Transylvania to be recognized as a federal entity of the Romanian state.&lt;ref&gt;Major, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, the [[Artur Văitoianu]] cabinet, with support from [[Iuliu Maniu]],&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; sent Comnen on mission to Hungary, where he also ledd the Romanian press office.&lt;ref&gt;Potra, p. 607&lt;/ref&gt; This experience, in the aftermath of the Soviet Republic, acquainted Petrescu with communism (as detailed by his memoir, published 1957).&lt;ref name="uscăt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 334, 352; Vițalaru, p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; Residing at [[Hotel Gellért]] in [[Budapest]], he left the city with the lifting of Romanian occupation in October 1919. As a hostile [[Royal Hungarian Army|National Army]] moved in, he still expressed his belief that [[Hungary–Romania relations]] would be mended and preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Radu Cosmin, ''Românii la Budapesta, II. În capitala lui Bella Kuhn'', p. 341. Bucharest: Editura Librăriei Stănciulescu, 1920.  {{OCLC|431185998}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he was secretly approached by Bánffy to discuss "reconciliation between the Hungarian and Romanian peoples".&lt;ref&gt;Major, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Comnen later claimed that he had also reached a friendly agreement with Count Andrássy and other Hungarian conservatives, but that this had been vetoed by Maniu.&lt;ref name="uscăt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Memorii, VI'', p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; If accepted, the Hungarian proposal would have led to the establishment of a [[dual monarchy]]; [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]], [[King of the Romanians]], would have also reigned as Ferdinand VI [[King of Hungary|of Hungary]].&lt;ref name="uscăt"/&gt;

Petrescu-Comnen soon joined the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL), and, in the [[Romanian general election, 1919|November 1919 election]], he won a [[Durostor County]] seat in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]].&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 334; Vițalaru, p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; He had little connection with his constituency, but was selected by the local party chapter because of his good reputation as an advocate of Dobrujan Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; He only took his seat in 1920, when he returned from Paris,&lt;ref name="ic25"&gt;Ion Constantinescu, "«Domnilor, vă stricați sănătatea degeaba...»", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', July 1971, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; and was again reelected [[Romanian general election, 1922|in March 1922]]); throughout these separate terms, he was active on [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]]'s Foreign Policy Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Vițalaru, p. 347. See also Potra, p. 607&lt;/ref&gt; Vaida-Voevod was Prime Minister of a coalition cabinet formed by the [[Romanian National Party]], the [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]], and the [[Democratic Nationalist Party (Romania)|Democratic Nationalists]]. Petrescu-Comnen spearheaded the PNL opposition, especially so during March 1920, when he filibustered against the appointment of [[Nicolae L. Lupu]] as [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Interior Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Memorii, II'', pp. 349–350&lt;/ref&gt; He was also noted for proposing legislation that made striking illegal, pressuring the Vaida-Voevod cabinet to look into allegations of [[Bolshevik]] influence inside the [[Socialist Party of Romania]]. Despite PNL protests and support from the far-right [[National-Christian Defense League]], Petrescu's law was not passed.&lt;ref name="ic25"/&gt; A disappointed Vaida-Voevod claimed that, with his new career in Parliament, Petrescu had "sacrificed himself" to Brătianu's "politicking".&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geneva and Weimar Republic===
Still active in diplomacy, Petrescu-Comnen had enjoyed a friendly rapport with the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]] and, in 1920, had played a role in negotiating the [[Polish-Romanian Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Memorii, II'', pp. 364–365&lt;/ref&gt; From 1922 to 1927, he was also a perennial Romanian delegate to the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO).&lt;ref&gt;Potra, p. 608&lt;/ref&gt; On July 10, 1923, he was named ambassador to Bern, and, in August of that year, also became delegate to the [[League of Nations]];&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 335; Vițalaru, pp. 347, 348&lt;/ref&gt; according to Constantinide, he owed this appointment to his political connections.&lt;ref name="Constantinide"/&gt; He followed with concern the [[Locarno Treaties]], which signaled a normalization of relations with the [[Weimar Republic]], and as such the ominous rise of a new Germany. He wanted Romania to align herself with the anti-League [[Kingdom of Italy]] as a safeguard, personally befriending [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Dino Grandi]] during ILO meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 335–336&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with representatives of both Poland and [[Lithuania]] against a hostile [[Soviet Union]], which they viewed as a [[rogue state]]. When the latter would not adhere to the Convention for the Control of the Trade in Arms and Ammunition, Comnen, [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]] and [[Dovas Zaunius]] introduced their own opt-out objections to the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Stone, "Imperialism and Sovereignty: The League of Nations' Drive to Control the Global Arms Trade", in ''[[Journal of Contemporary History]]'', Vol. 35, Issue 2, April 2000, pp. 227–230&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside [[Nicolae Titulescu]], who took over his seat at the League of Nations, Comnen worked to convince the Entente that Greater Romania was respecting her [[Minorities of Romania|ethnic minorities]]. One effort, which also involved [[Constantin Angelescu]] and [[Alexandru C. Constantinescu]], involved a defense of Romania's educational programs, confronting propaganda by [[Albert Apponyi]] and the "Hungarian bishops".&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 72–78&lt;/ref&gt; Titulescu and Comnen made a poor impression with British diplomats by producing blunt threats, such as announcing that Romania would individually sue all Hungarian colonists still present in the [[Banat]].&lt;ref&gt;Miklós Zeidler, "The League of Nations and Hungarian Minority Petitions", in Ferenc Eiler, Dagmar Hájková (eds.), ''Czech and Hungarian Minority Policy in Central Europe 1918–1938'', p. 100. Prague &amp; Budapest: Masarykův ústav a Archiv Akademie věd České republiky &amp; MTA Etnikai-nemzeti Kisebbségkutató Intézete, 2009.  {{ISBN|978-80-86495-54-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they convinced the Norwegian inspector [[Erik Colban]] that they were acting in good faith.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Osăceanu, "România versus Ungaria la Societatea Națiunilor", in ''Studii și Articole de Istorie'', Vol. LXXVI, 2010, pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; Comnen also called for a negative campaign against the [[Magyar Party (Romania)|Magyar Party]], once the latter had appealed to the League.&lt;ref name="Nastasă"/&gt; 

Aware of the issues faced by Romanian Hungarians, Jews and other communities, Comnen showed his concern about what this could effect for Greater Romania's image abroad. In 1924, reporting from the League of Nations, he complained that the new [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Kingdom of Hungary]] had a tactical advantage: "it is confident that our situation inside the European concert of nations is shakier than that of [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], that the situation of minorities is in reality less good than elsewhere, and, finally, that an unfavorable current can be easily determined against us with support from [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]], Jews, Catholics and Protestants the world over".&lt;ref name="Nastasă"&gt;Lucian Nastasă, "Maghiarii din România și etica minoritară. Repere istorice, 1920–1940", in Lucian Nastasă, Levente Salat (eds.), ''Maghiarii din România și etica minoritară'', p. 37. Cluj-Napoca: Ethnocultural Diversity Resource Center, 2003.  {{ISBN|973-86239-1-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 and again in 1925, he welcomed in Geneva the Romanian politico [[Nicolae Iorga]], who lectured to an international public about [[Balkan]] topics and "imperialism in the Orient".&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Memorii, IV'', pp. 131, 222&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1926, a new National Liberal cabinet proposed Petrescu-Comnen for the post of [[List of Ambassadors from Romania to the United States|Ambassador to the United States]]. He adamantly refused, noting that America was "radically incompatible" with his character;&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; he asked instead to be moved to Rome. In the end, he was dispatched to Berlin, which was considered a very difficult mission, suited for his talents.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; He served there between February 9, 1927 and May 1937, interrupted by a mandate to the [[Holy See]] (January 1930 – May 1932).&lt;ref name="Constantinide"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 336–342; Potra, p. 608; Rostovsky &amp; Forter, p. 317; Vițalaru, pp. 347, 348–352&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, Comnen also joined the faculty of [[The Hague Academy of International Law]].&lt;ref&gt;Potra, p. 608&lt;/ref&gt;

His main contribution during the Weimar period was a German–Romanian Chamber of Commerce. Entirely his "brainchild", it was established in November 1929 with funds pooled by [[Danatbank]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Dresdner Bank]], [[Krupp]], and [[Otto Wolff]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen G. Gross, ''Export Empire: German Soft Power in Southeastern Europe, 1890–1945'', p. 100. Cambridge etc.: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2015.  {{ISBN|978-1-107-53148-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a partisan of Titulescu's policies, Comnen was in favor of normalizing [[Romania–Russia relations|Romanian–Soviet relations]], attempting to settle the issue of [[Bessarabia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ragsdale &amp; Trommer, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1927, he approached [[Maxim Litvinov]], a Soviet diplomat who served as [[Foreign Minister of Russia|Foreign Minister]]. Despite harsh criticism at home over speculations that Romania was dropping her guard, this helped bring about a period of communication between the government of Romania and the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Ragsdale &amp; Trommer, pp. 55–57&lt;/ref&gt; He also reported that, with backing from [[Gustav Stresemann]], he could solve another major dispute, surrounding the [[Romanian Treasure]], but that his government overseers never let him.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Memorii, VI'', p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

Comnen's stint in [[Vatican City]] was prompted by the government reshuffle ordered by Prime Minister Maniu, and disappointed Petrescu-Comnen: he was negotiating an economic treaty with Germany and, moreover, preferred the post of ambassador to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Vițalaru, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; While in Rome, he was primarily noted for protesting against the apparent rapprochement between the Holy See and Hungary, but also for using his position to guess at Mussolini's external policies.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 337&lt;/ref&gt; He was responsible for obtaining from [[Pope Pius XI]] a quick recognition of [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] as [[King of the Romanians]], following the latter's coup, and for ending a long-standing dispute surrounding the corporate status of [[Catholic Church in Romania|Romanian Roman Catholic churches]].&lt;ref&gt;Vițalaru, pp. 349–350&lt;/ref&gt; 

Comnen's contacts in Vatican City informed him of an imminent Soviet attack on Romania, which is supposedly why Maniu massively increased military spending.&lt;ref&gt;Brînzeu, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of his term coincided with Iorga's premiership: Petrescu-Comnen advised the cabinet not to engage in "violent and hasty" actions against the Hungarian Catholic clergy, while personally ensuring cooperation between the state and the [[Romanian Greek Catholic Church|Greek-Rite Catholics]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Memorii, VI'', pp. 206, 220–221&lt;/ref&gt; According to Iorga, he was supporting the King and the government, including against the PNL, boasting that he had stopped a PNL propaganda campaign abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Memorii, VI'', p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; His dealings with the Holy See were opposed by rival [[Onisifor Ghibu]], who claimed that Petrescu-Comnen was a disgrace to his office.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Memorii, VI'', p. 392&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ambassador to Nazi Germany===
Even from Italy, Petrescu-Comnen closely observed the [[Great Depression]] and the decline of the Weimar Republic. Already in 1931, while vacationing in [[Brittany]], he had predicted that Germany would fall to communism.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Memorii, VI'', p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; His return to Berlin was facilitated by Carol II, who complained that the outgoing ambassador, [[Gheorghe Tașcă]], was "nonexistent".&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Memorii, VI'', pp. 311, 355&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] came as a surprise. Petrescu-Comnen was prudent in his contacts with the Nazis, and his diplomatic notes of the time were ambivalent.&lt;ref name="Constantinide"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 337–341; {{ro icon}} [[Victor Neumann]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/articol/diplomatia-romaniei-fata-in-fata-cu-reich-ul-nazist/ "Diplomația României față în față cu Reich-ul nazist"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 60, April 2001; Vițalaru, pp. 350–351&lt;/ref&gt; Former Prime Minister Iorga, who remained friends with Comnen, records that Comnen thought [[Adolf Hitler]] "naive and sincere, still learning the ropes."&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Memorii, VII'', p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1934, Comnen was hoping to drive a wedge between [[German re-armament]] and [[Hungarian irredentism]], approaching various factions represented in the [[Hitler Cabinet]]. In May, he invited [[Ioan Lupaș]] of the Romanian Anti-Revisionist League to lecture in Berlin about minority religions in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandru Mareș, "Liga antirevizionistă română și iredentismul", in ''Studii și Articole de Istorie'', Vol. LXXVI, 2010, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he and consul [[Constantin Karadja]] obtained from [[Hermann Göring]] a guarantee that Germany would not go to war over Hungary—but this pledge was quickly dismissed by [[Konstantin von Neurath]] and [[Alfred Rosenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Potra, pp. 209–210, 311–313; Rosenberg ''et al.'', pp. 60–62&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberg was persuaded that Comnen, a "Titulescu representative", was lying, and began maneuvering to have him recalled.&lt;ref&gt;Potra, p. 210; Rosenberg ''et al.'', pp. 62, 108&lt;/ref&gt; Comnen's Russian policy was soon restored by the apparent upset in German–Soviet relations and the [[Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance]].&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 338, 339–340&lt;/ref&gt; He preferred this realignment to the Nazi alternative: his notes of 1936 show him alarmed by the "antisemitic objective" of Nazism (accurately predicting a ''[[Kristallnacht]]''), by the regime's [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany|public anti-Catholicism]], and overall by the "nebulous criteria of German law".&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 340–341&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although he viewed the [[1936 Winter Olympics|Winter]] and [[1936 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] as propaganda, Comnen accepted the Olympics Cross, First Class from Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 341, 354&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following months, the rise of the fascist [[Iron Guard]] and the [[Romanian general election, 1937|problematic elections of December 1937]] upset the liberal order in Romania. In the run-up to the elections, Comnen had sought to mitigate Germany's open support for the Iron Guard, offering its government a chance to apologize for [[Wilhelm Fabricius|Ambassador Fabricius]]' presence at the [[funerals of Ion Moța and Vasile Marin]]. This request was angrily rejected in Berlin, mainly because the ambassador "had only attended a religious ceremony".&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Memorii, VII'', p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Carol pleased Germany by handing government to [[Octavian Goga]] and his Nazi-oriented [[National Christian Party]] (PNC). Comnen confirmed to this standard, communicating in Berlin the guidelines of Romania's neutralist policy: preservation of [[France–Romania relations|Franco–]] and [[Romania–United Kingdom relations|British–Romanian relations]], full economic cooperation with Germany, and "no hostile attitude toward Russia."&lt;ref&gt;Cristian-Alexandru Boghian, "The Management of Romania's Communication with Germany, Italy and the USSR in the Context of Octavian Goga's Government (1937–1938)", in ''Communication, Context and Interdisciplinarity'', Vol. 3, 2015, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;

Comnen went on to serve as undersecretary of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Foreign Affairs Ministry]], which was led by [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]]. His advancement was supposed to placate Germany, which had been unpleasantly surprised by the PNC's downfall; it was also greeted by the Italian ambassador, [[Ugo Sola]].&lt;ref&gt;Vițalaru, p. 351. See also Pavlowitch, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; He was described in the ''[[Journal des Débats]]'' as primarily a [[Francophile]],&lt;ref&gt;Vițalaru, p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; but continued to be seen by the ''[[Federal Foreign Office|Auswärtiges Amt]]'' as a friend of Germany in the cabinet, on par with [[Alexandru Averescu]] and [[Constantin Argetoianu]].&lt;ref&gt;Arhire, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his recall to Bucharest, Hitler showed his appreciation for the diplomat in a special letter to Carol II—this was a first in Romanian annals.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after taking office, Comnen, who was more probably a neutralist,&lt;ref&gt;Arhire, p. 293; Prisăcaru, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; presided upon the council of the [[Balkan Pact]], and, in February 1938, drafted its [[Ankara]] resolution, condemning "any interference in the internal politics" of member states.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ministerial term===
====''Anschluss'' and Munich Crisis====
During the early days of 1938, Comnen announced that he was no longer involved with the National Liberal Party, taking his distance from Tătărescu.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Memorii, VII'', p. 462&lt;/ref&gt; Widely tipped to become the full minister, he took over on March 30, days after the ''[[Anschluss]]'' crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; His term coincided with the major developments in Carol's feud with the Iron Guard; Prime Minister [[Miron Cristea]] served Carol's own authoritarian regime, which consolidated a single-party [[National Renaissance Front]]. One of Comnen's first actions was to inform the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|British Foreign Office]] and the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|French Foreign Ministry]] about Germany's economic tactics; he also advised Germany not to act against Czechoslovakia, or risk a "world war".&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 342–343&lt;/ref&gt; Comnen also emphasized the importance of Franco–British–Romanian relations by elevating the ranks of his ambassadors in both countries, and by making Tătărescu his Paris envoy.&lt;ref&gt;Pavlowitch, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; However, Romania was facing international criticism over her disbanding of the [[Internationalization of the Danube River|Danube Commission]] and her introduction of [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|antisemitic laws]].&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; Her relations with Britain were also strained by the appointment of [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], a proponent of [[appeasement]] and thus "great friend of Hitlerian Germany", as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]].&lt;ref&gt;Pop, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation was complicated by a sudden worsening of relations with the Soviet Union, when the Soviet diplomat [[Fedor Butenko]] disappeared in Bucharest. Before the details of this escape emerged, the Soviet side was claiming that Butenko had been abducted or killed by a PNC militia, the ''[[Lăncieri]]''. There was a sudden worsening of Romanian–Soviet relations, almost to the brink of war.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Memorii, VII'', pp. 461–463&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the investigating team informed Comnen of the actual facts, namely that Butenko had defected of his own free will, to escape a likely execution in the [[Great Purge]]; this was later confirmed in a letter which Butenko addressed to the Romanian Foreign Ministry from his new home in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Maffei, pp. 541–545&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being targeted by Soviet officials, who alleged that he had a role in this affair, he did not speak publicly in support of Butenko.&lt;ref&gt;Maffei, p. 545; Petrescu, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrescu-Comnen was subject to increasing pressures from the Germans to reorient his country's foreign policy towards the [[Tripartite Pact]]. Rosenberg called on Petrescu-Comnen to abandon Little Entente commitments to Czechoslovakia, as a prerequisite for good economic exchanges with Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfus, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian minister sought to counter such pressures by negotiating an economic treaty with Britain, which was still being discussed, then shelved, in August 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Pop, pp. 124–125&lt;/ref&gt; The relations were tested by the question of [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jewish]] disenfranchisement, with Comnen refusing to accept British suggestions that the policy be reversed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/1938/05/10/archive/rumania-rejects-compromise-on-citizenship-revision-to-ignore-petitions ''Rumania Rejects Compromise on Citizenship Revision; to Ignore Petitions''], [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] release, May 10, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; Progressively, Romania was coming to terms with her economic dependency on Germany, with Comnen issuing statements that hinted to a change of priorities in foreign affairs. Romania was therefore quick in recognizing the ''Anschluss'' as "unavoidable"&lt;ref&gt;Arhire, pp. 293–294&lt;/ref&gt; and "unobjectionable".&lt;ref&gt;Prisăcaru, pp. 181–182&lt;/ref&gt; His ministry still attempted to prioritize Romania's commitment to Czechoslovakia (tested by both Nazi and Polish demands, as well as by Czechoslovakia's friendship towards the Soviet state); it eventually witnessed the [[Munich Agreement]], and, despite official protests, had to seek a new course in European politics.&lt;ref&gt;Arhire, pp. 349–350; Dreyfus, p. 348; Mareș, ''passim''; Petrescu, pp. 343–346; Ragsdale &amp; Trommer, pp. 55, 77–78&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrescu-Comnen was reserved about the Soviets' intervention on Czechoslovakia's side; he insisted that Romanian cooperation with the [[Red Army]] would only come with a recognition of Bessarabia as Romanian territory.&lt;ref&gt;Cienciala, p. 96; Petrescu, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, Comnen and the rest of his government expected France to provide Romania with guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;Arhire, pp. 349–350; Carley, pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; Contacted by [[Maxim Litvinov]] and [[Kamil Krofta]] in September, he promised that he would obtain flyover rights for the [[Soviet Air Forces]], but these were never approved by his government.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt; In conversation with [[Georges Bonnet]], he confessed his own fears, namely that Litvinov was preparing the invasion of Bessarabia; he also commented at length on Romania's unpreparedness for war. According to Comnen, Soviet aircraft could cross into Romania's airspace at will, if the Soviets so desired, since it could not ever be hit by Romanian [[flak gun]]s; he also insisted that a Red Army presence in Romania would have been of no service to Czechoslovakia, since roads linking Bessarabia to [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] were few and poorly maintained.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, p. 203. See also Bregman, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; 

By then, Romania's airspace was intensely used by Soviet aircraft. When pressed about this issue by Göring, as [[Ministry of Aviation (Nazi Germany)|Germany's Air Minister]], Comnen insisted that the planes could not be downed.&lt;ref&gt;Moisuc, pp. 290–291&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, with his revelations about the flak range, Comnen gave the Soviets a free pass—as noted by French diplomatic cables, he did not want terrestrial passage, but "close[d] his eyes to overflights of [Romania's] territory."&lt;ref&gt;Carley, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Air defense, Comnen promised, "would take a few badly aimed potshots at Soviet planes, and that would be that."&lt;ref&gt;Carley, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; More officially, in September he also allowed the [[Czechoslovak Air Force]] to fly its newly purchased warplanes from Soviet bases, over Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Prisăcaru, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Beneš and [[Heliodor Píka]] later testified that Comnen had respected his promises to Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref&gt;Moisuc, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; As argued by journalist Alexander Bregman and historian [[Anna M. Cienciala]], this exposes as false the claims publicized by [[Soviet historiography]], according to which Romania sabotaged the Czechoslovak–Soviet entente. The Soviets, they note, limited their involvement because they were unprepared for war with Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Bregman, pp. 307–309; Cienciala, pp. 96–97&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, as argued by historians such as Rebecca Haynes, Comnen himself never prepared for a Romanian military intervention in support of Czechoslovakia, except against an invasion by or from Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Ionel Sîrbu, "Recenzii. Rebecca Haynes, ''Politica României față de Germania între 1936 și 1940''", in ''Codrul Cosminului'', Issue 10, 2004, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

====Crumbling alliances====
[[File:Carpathian Ruthenia issue, 1938.svg|thumb|330px|The issue of [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] (or [[Carpatho-Ukraine]]) in 1938: [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|post-Munich Czechoslovakia]] and the other countries of the [[Little Entente]] in blue, with Carpatho-Ukraine shaded; in red, [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary]] and her supporter, [[Second Republic of Poland|Poland]]. The region's annexation would have cut off Czechoslovakia's links with all her allies]]
In May, at the height of the Munich crisis, Petrescu-Comnen surfaced as a spokesman for the [[Little Entente]] as a whole. He represented it at the League of Nations, where he recognized the [[Italian Ethiopia|Italian annexation of Ethiopia]] as irreversible. He "took the initiative in liquidating the Ethiopian question",&lt;ref&gt;"La journée: Dernières nouvelles. Le problème éthiopien à la Société des Nations", in ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]'', May 2, 1938, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; then followed the Anglo–French attempt to restore relations with Italy: "the Italian conquest would have to be acknowledged, unless [League members] were prepared to live forever in an unreal world."&lt;ref&gt;"Abyssinia's Fate. Conquest Recognition. Debate at Geneva. British View Favoured", in ''[[The West Australian]]'', May 14, 1938, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Comnen also hosted the Little Entente leaders at a summit in [[Sinaia]], and agreed to negotiate a collective nonaggression pact with Hungary; he also empowered [[Ioannis Metaxas]] to approach the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] for similar talks. He managed to sign accords to that effect (the [[Bled agreement (1938)|Bled]] and [[Salonika Agreement|Salonika agreements]]), despite German pressures on Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;Boisdron, pp. 79–84; Moisuc, pp. 285–286; Petrescu, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; Although celebrated in France as a major achievement for peace and stability, these arrangements were in fact "very banal", and Bled presented no guarantees for Czechoslovakia's survival.&lt;ref&gt;Boisdron, pp. 80–82&lt;/ref&gt; They were also notable for lifting the ban on Hungarian re-armament, which he advertised as a prelude to reaching "good terms with Hungary."&lt;ref&gt;Kenéz, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; However, Comnen delayed the application of that clause to October, which reportedly caused [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Hungary)|Hungary's Forign Minister]], [[Kálmán Kánya]], to lose his temper on at least one occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Mareș, pp. 310–311&lt;/ref&gt;

Comnen was highly critical of Poland's participation in the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], which upset his plans for resistance. Returning to Geneva as the Little Entente was falling apart, he managed to persuade Yugoslavia's [[Milan Stojadinović]] not to give up on the project. On September 23, they addressed Hungary an ultimatum, threatening war if she would invade Czechoslovakia; Stojadinović rescinded five days later.&lt;ref&gt;Moisuc, pp. 286–287&lt;/ref&gt; Comnen continued to press for Yugoslavia to maintain the Little Entente, while also urging [[Jan Syrový]]'s government to reconcile with the Ruthenian autonomists and the [[Slovak People's Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Mareș, pp. 78, 335, 366–368, 377&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, he also approached Litvinov, promising that Romania would play no part in "anti-Soviet actions",&lt;ref&gt;Moisuc, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; also renouncing the demand for territorial guarantees, and even proposing that the Red Army be allowed to cross into Carpathian Ruthenia by way of [[Cernăuți County]].&lt;ref&gt;Cienciala, pp. 100–101&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Polish-Romanian Alliance was also threatened by warm [[Hungary–Poland relations]]. Among the Polish diplomats, Count Leo Orlowski theorized that Romania should join the alliance with Hungary, "a country of the future", and abandon Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref&gt;Mareș, pp. 65, 362–363&lt;/ref&gt; At an October conference in [[Galați]], Comnen tried to persuade [[Józef Beck]], the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Poland)|Polish Foreign Minister]], not to accept a Hungarian takeover in Ruthenia. He then refused Polish offers for Romania to annex parts of that region, in [[Northern Maramuresh]].&lt;ref&gt;Budurowycz, pp. 61–63; Mareș, pp. 64–87, 89–103, 110–112, 129, 273, 285–286, 291–292, 324–325, 331–333, 363, 372–379, 396–397, 434; Petrescu, pp. 343–346; Trașcă &amp; Grad, pp. 187–192&lt;/ref&gt; Confronted with Romania's argument that either Czechoslovak rule or an independent [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] were preferable to [[Hungarian irredentism]], Beck became convinced that Comnen was a "perfect imbecile", describing him as such in his memoirs.&lt;ref&gt;Budurowycz, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Comnen obtained from him a promise that Poland would intervene to reduce Hungary's territorial demands, but Beck never acted on that pledge.&lt;ref&gt;Mareș, pp. 93–102, 301, 306, 309–310, 372–374, 395–405&lt;/ref&gt; For his part, Comenen continued to aggravate the Poles by stating his support for an independent [[Ukraine]], which he argued would be a natural ally of Poland and Romania against both Germany and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Mareș, p. 415&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, Petrescu-Comnen worked with [[George Oprescu]] and [[Marie of Romania]], organizing the exhibit of German [[old master print]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Radu Moțoc, "O inițiere în istoria gravurii", in ''Confluențe Bibliologice'', Nr. 3–4/2009, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that France and Britain were not going to defend Romania,&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 345–346; Prisăcaru, pp. 186–188&lt;/ref&gt; he ultimately took Romania closer to Germany and the [[Axis Powers]]. From October 1938, he tried to persuade Germany not to dismantle [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|reduced Czechoslovakia]], and especially not to allow Hungary to annex Ruthenia. Despite assurances that Germany would only let Hungary take [[Hungarians in Ukraine|Hungarian areas]], the [[First Vienna Award]] produced a Hungarian [[Carpathian Ruthenia during World War II|Governorate of Subcarpathia]], which isolated Romania's territory.&lt;ref&gt;Trașcă &amp; Grad, pp. 193–196&lt;/ref&gt; This then opened the way for Hungarian demands in Transylvania. In November, Comnen suggested settling the Transylvanian issue through a [[population exchange]] with Hungary, noting that [[Hungarians in Romania|Romania's Hungarians]] were mostly town-dwellers. This proposal was rejected by demographer Béla Kenéz on the Hungarian side—he noted that it would have implied removing almost 2 million people to make room for the 16,000 [[Romanians in Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenéz, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Comnen also spearheaded a project to encourage the [[Fifth Aliyah|a mass emigration of Romanian Jews]], a draft of which was presented by [[Wilhelm Filderman]] and accepted on behalf of government by [[Mihai Ralea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Aurel Vainer]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20160416040538/https://www.jewishfed.ro/downloads/realitatea/RE442-443.pdf "Contribuția evreimii române la Așezământul Muncii în Ereț Israel"], in ''[[Realitatea Evreiască]]'', Issues 442–443, January 2015, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downfall===
The change of policy toward Germany incensed the underground democratic opposition, and especially Maniu's [[National Peasants' Party]]. It accused Carol of appeasement and called for a national unity cabinet to deal with the crisis. In that context, Comnen had a publicized meeting with three former Ministers of Foreign Affairs ([[Dimitrie I. Ghika]], [[Victor Antonescu]], [[Istrate Micescu]]), showing that they backed his German rapprochement.&lt;ref&gt;Mareș, pp. 413–414&lt;/ref&gt; The effort proved largely futile: as Comnen himself noted, Hitler resented Carol for repressing the Iron Guard and murdering its leader, [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]]; reportedly, this implicit criticism of the regime brought his demotion, by Carol, on December 20.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; However, Yugoslav diplomat Kosta St. Pavlowitch recalls that Carol had the idea to replace Comnen with [[Grigore Gafencu]], a journalist for ''[[Timpul]]'', when the three of them were in London; while there, Gafencu won the king's confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Pavlowitch, pp. 241–242&lt;/ref&gt; Before Gafencu took over, Comnen was informed that he would return as Romania's representative to the Holy See.&lt;ref&gt;Vițalaru, pp. 351–352&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pavlowitch, he had overall proven himself "a conscious bureaucrat and an astute diplomat, [...] but, as was reported, did not rise to the challenge of the events. [...] During the deepest of Europe's crises, [...] Romanian foreign politics had been entrusted to someone who had no means of influencing the events, and who looked on passively as the ground was slipping away from under his feet".&lt;ref&gt;Pavlowitch, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pact of Neutral Countries, 1939 proposal.svg|thumb|340px|Petrescu-Comnen's proposed "Pact of Neutral Countries" (in gold)—[[Balkan Pact]] members, joined by [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and protected by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. In black, the [[Axis Powers]]; [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in blue and [[Soviet Union]] in red (1939 borders)]]
Petrescu-Comnen took up his new office in Rome on January 20, 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Vițalaru, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; From his posting, he witnessed the revelations of a [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|German–Soviet Pact]], which, as he reported to Gafencu, placed Romania in imminent danger.&lt;ref&gt;Georgeta Fodor, "Recenzii și note de lectură. ''România–Vatican. Relații Diplomatice, I, 1920–1950''", in ''Studia Universitatis Petru Maior. Series Historica'', Vol. 7, 2007, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in Rome after the outbreak of World War II a week later. The [[German invasion of Poland]] convinced Comnen that there was "no reasoning to be tried with the Germans"—a pessimisitic note which contrasted Gafencu's attempts to reach a new understanding with the Axis.&lt;ref&gt;Mareș, pp. 197–198&lt;/ref&gt; According to his own recollections, he was entrusted by Gafencu and [[Şükrü Saracoğlu]] with obtaining Italian backing for the [[Balkan Pact]], which was to include a pacified Bulgaria; at the time, Italy was still "non-belligerent".&lt;ref&gt;Frank Marzari, "Projects for an Italian-Led Balkan Bloc of Neutrals, September–December 1939", in ''[[The Historical Journal]]'', Vol. 13, Issue 4, December 1970, pp. 767–788&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mussolini eventually backed Hitler, Comen still hoped to obtain Italian and papal support for Romania before and during the [[Second Vienna Award]].&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 346–347; Vițalaru, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; By April 1940, he was allegedly contacted by [[Myron Charles Taylor]], and through him informed US foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Brînzeu, p. 372&lt;/ref&gt;

Hungary's annexation of [[Northern Transylvania]], preceded by the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia]], signaled a regime change in Romania. In September 1940, King Carol was ousted and an Axis-aligned [[National Legionary State|Iron Guard government]] took over in Bucharest; Petrescu-Comnen, identified as a pillar of the old system, was sacked within days.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 347; Vițalaru, pp. 347, 353&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively, his mission ended on November 15, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Vițalaru, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|civil war of January 1941]], which Petrescu-Comnen described as Romania's "black days",&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; the Guardist regime was replaced, and [[Ion Antonescu]] governed alone. From his new home in [[Merano]], Comnen petitioned the ministry, insisting that he could still prove useful in his dealings with the Holy See, and through it prevent the [[Magyarization]] of Northern Transylvania. He found a backer in the government secretary, Alexandru Cretzianu,&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 347–348&lt;/ref&gt; but was denied full reemployment. He was ultimately pensioned on May 1, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Mareș, p. 356; Petrescu, p. 348; Potra, p. 608; Vițalaru, p. 347&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Florence===
Like many other diplomats who favored the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], Comnen decided not to return home as Antonescu sealed Romania's alliance with the Axis.&lt;ref&gt;Vițalaru, p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he was co-opted by [[Viorel Tilea]] on London's [[Romanian National Committee]] (RNC)—alongside Gafencu, [[Dimitrie Dimăncescu]], and [[Ioan Pangal]].&lt;ref&gt;Petraru, pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; Settled in [[Florence]], he led an [[International Red Cross]] Committee, and founded an exile section of the [[Romanian Red Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 348; Potra, p. 608&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, after the [[Allied invasion of Italy]], he mediated between the two sides to preserve the city's art and architecture from destruction, and in return was awarded the title of honorary citizen of Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 348–349, 353&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he published in Geneva the book ''Anarchie, dictature ou l'organisation internationale'' ("Anarchy, Dictatorship or International Organization").&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 351; Vițalaru, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

Choosing to remain in exile to Italy after the [[Soviet occupation of Romania]], Petrescu-Comnen spoke out against [[communization]] and lectured in particular against the [[Danubian Confederation]] project; nevertheless, he intervened to mitigate the effects of drought and famine in his native country.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 349–350&lt;/ref&gt; By 1947, he was also collecting and publishing in Florence his records of the war, and of his own part in it, as ''Preludi del grande dramma'' ("Preludes of the Great Tragedy"), followed in 1949 by the more detailed ''I Responsabili'' ("The Culprits"), at [[Mondadori]]. In exile, he resumed contacts with Carol, who stated his appreciation for the diplomat and described ''Preludi'' as the best analysis of Romania's plight in the late interwar.&lt;ref&gt;Pavlowitch, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; The books were also reviewed by the historian [[Carlile Aylmer Macartney]], who also found ''Preludi'' to be the better work: in ''I Responsabili'', he argued, the "butter is spread more thinly", including "a general account of European developments in which M. Comnène had himself no hand, and for which he uses sources which are generally available". According to Macartney, the books show Comnen as "well informed, intelligent, and right-minded",  his "sketches of various personalities" displaying "elegance and ''esprit''."&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlile Aylmer Macartney]], "Reviews of Books. Second World War and Its Origins. ''Preludi del grande dramma'', by N. P. Comnène; ''I Responsabili'', by N. P. Comnène", in ''[[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]]'', Vol. 26, Issue 2, 1950, pp. 234–235&lt;/ref&gt;

Comnen's hope of returning to Romania was curbed by the establishment of a [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]]. He joined Gafencu in cooperating with the [[European Movement International]] (also advancing a [[United States of Europe|European federation]] in his various articles and books), while also maintaining links with the RNC, now an anti-communist organization, building bridges between the latter and the Holy See.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 350–352&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, he intervened as a mediator Gafencu and the RNC leader, [[Nicolae Rădescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 350–351&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[Constantin Vișoianu]] nominated him as RNC representative to the Vatican,&lt;ref&gt;Petraru, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; although he was eventually assigned, that same year, to represent the RNC in the Italian republic.&lt;ref&gt;Potra, p. 608&lt;/ref&gt; 

Comnen was also taking trips to Brazil, initially as a delegate of Florence city council.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1954, he was at [[Rio de Janeiro]], lecturing at the Romanian House on issues of international diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Ático Vilas-Boas da Mota, "Casa Română din Rio de Janeiro sau 'Tărâmul nostalgiei'", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', February 2001, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; He resumed his publishing in 1957, with the memoirs of his 1919 trip to Hungary (published by a Romanian group in [[Madrid]]) and the historical review ''Luci e ombre sull'Europa'' ("Lights and Shadows over Europe").&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; By then, his Bucharest townhouse, located within walking distance of [[Victory Square, Bucharest|Victory Square]], had been confiscated by the communist regime together with his ''[[objets d'art]]'' and his antique book collection.&lt;ref name="apcasă"/&gt; His family was also exposed to persecution: nephew Dan Cernovodeanu was sent to a labor camp on the [[Danube–Black Sea Canal]]; while there, he conspired with fellow inmate Ion Mitucă. In 1955, the latter, who was planning an anti-communist insurgency, tried to defect and contact Comnen.&lt;ref name="mdsbm99–100"/&gt;

The former minister died in his adoptive Florence, without completing work on his final volume, a diplomatic history of Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to receiving the Olympic Cross and the Order of Saint George knighthood, he had been a Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Star of Romania]], a Grand Cross of the [[Order For Merit]], an Officer of the [[Order of the Crown (Romania)|Order of the Crown]], a Commander of the Order of the Cross of Marie; a Grand Cross of the ''[[Pour le Mérite]]'', the [[Order of the German Eagle|German Eagle]], the [[Saxe-Ernestine House Order]], the [[Order of George I]], the [[Order of the Crown of Italy]], and the [[Order of the Yugoslav Crown]]; as well as Commander of the [[Order of the Redeemer]] and the ''[[Order of Polonia Restituta|Polonia Restituta]]'', an Officer of the [[Order of the Oak Crown|Oak Crown]], a Knight of the ''[[Ordre des Palmes Académiques]]'' and the [[House Order of Hohenzollern]], and a recipient of [[Benemerenti medal]].&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by daughter Elsa-Irène, known after marriage as Irene Bie, who lived in [[Maryhill, Washington]] and donated her collection of Romanian paintings to the local art gallery, named after her father;&lt;ref name="mhill"/&gt; and by daughter-in-law Angela Comnène. The latter published in 1982 an English biography of Comnen, and did research into his genealogy.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 331–332&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Censorship in Communist Romania|Communist censorship]] meant that Comnen's contribution was unmentioned in Romania until the 1970s, when his work was briefly covered, with some excerpts, detailing his anti-Nazism, appearing in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'' in the early 1980s; his memory was primarily maintained by his peers in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 352–354&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], he was again the subject of public scrutiny: his ''Notes sur la guerre roumaine'' was translated and published by [[Polirom]] in 1995; and his decorations, donated to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Angela Comnène, went on public display in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 353–354&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, his documents relating to the Holy See were published as part of an [[Editura Enciclopedică]] series, with a preface by [[Jean-Claude Périsset]].&lt;ref&gt;Vițalaru, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; The Comnen house, heavily damaged during the [[1977 Vrancea earthquake]], was inscribed into the [[National Register of Historic Monuments in Romania]]. However, by 2011 it had fallen into disrepair and was threatened with demolition.&lt;ref name="apcasă"/&gt;

'''Nikola Dimitrov Nedeva''' (1886–1970) was a [[Bulgaria]]n [[Major general]], [[politician]] and [[Military history|military historian]]. He was the Minister of Interior affairs and Public Health in the third and fourth cabinets of [[Georgi Kyoseivanov]] (November 1938 to February 1940).

His first cousins were Lieutenant General [[Nikola Mihov]] and Major General Ivan Ivanov - descendants of the great Mollov’s family. Nedev was a friend of Petar Danov (also known by the name Beinsa Douno, and often called Master by his followers) who was a Bulgarian philosopher and spiritual teacher of the [[Universal White Brotherhood]]. Nedev was a follower of the Danov's teachings.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Nikola Nedev was born on the 7 July 1886 (20 July 1886 - new style) in [[Veliko Tarnovo]], Bulgaria into a family of intellectuals. After graduating from high school, he continued his education at the Higher Military School.

===Career===
On the 15 August 1907 Cadet Nedev graduated with excellence from the artillery class of the Higher Military School. As Second Lieutenant he began his career as platoon commander of the 5th artillery regiment in [[Shumen|Shoumen]], and on 1 January 1908, Second Lieutenant Nedev was promoted to platoon commander of the [[Sofia]] fortress battalion.

During his career as an officer, Nikola Nedev was promoted to the following ranks: Lieutenant, 4 September 1910, Captain 1 November 1913, Major 1 January 1918, Lieutenant Colonel 30 January 1923, Colonel 26 March 1928, and Major General 6 June 1935. In 1936 he retired from the army.

In 1911 Nedev was awarded an excellent mark in the entrance exam at the Higher Military Academy ''Еcole de guerre'' in Brussels, Belgium. During that time he served in the artillery arsenal and the coastguard. The same year, he married Tzvetanka Grozdanova (1892-1984). They had two children—daughter Rousska Nedev Koutzouglou (1915-2010), and son Dimitar Nedev (1916-1980).

====Participation in the Balkan War====
The war began after the [[Albania during the Balkan Wars|controversy]] between the allied Balkan countries Bulgaria, [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Greece]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] could not be resolved by political and diplomatic means. From 17 September 1912, the Bulgarian army mobilized about 600,000 people and 700 guns. The mobilized army of Serbia, Montenegro and Greece totaled 295,000 people and 648 guns. Many artists, sculptors, writers and actors joined the Bulgarian army as volunteers. Part of it was merged with 14,760 troops from Macedonia and Eastern [[Thrace]].

The Balkan war began on 5 October 1912. Captain Nedev was the commander of the 3rd battery of slight siege department of the Sofia fortress battalion. This artillery regiment was part of the [[Second Bulgarian Army]], which besieged [[Edirne]] fortress whose defender was the "Feric" (Iron) Mehmed Shukri Pasha.

The commanders of the Second Bulgarian Army– Lieutenant General [[Nikola Ivanov]], Major General George Vazov, Colonel [[Nikola Zhekov]], Major [[Ivan Valkov]], and the commander of the First Bulgarian Army Lieutenant General Basil Koutinchev, considered that an open assault against Edirne would be the successful tactic. The chief commanders, General [[Mihail Savov]], General [[Ivan Fichev]], and General [[Radko Dimitriev]], believed the town would be forced to surrender from the effects of the resulting famine. The Bulgarian and Serbian army, commanded by Major General Vladimir Vazov, carried out this tactic between 11–13 March 1913. Colonel Nedev was General Vazov’s adjutant. The tacti was successful and on the 13 March 1913 the Edirne fortress capitulated; Shukri Pasha was imprisoned. This was one of the happy and unique moment for Nikola Nedev and the Bulgarian soldiers during the Balkan war. There were many articles in the world press about the success of the Bulgarian army, and especially its military tactics.

====To Brussels and back====
After the war Nedev returned to Brussels to continue his education. When the [[World War I|Great War]] began, he returned to Bulgaria and was chosen to be the battery commander in the [[Shumen fortress]] battalion. In the spring of 1915 he was appointed as vice chairman of the new Military Historical Commission to the Staff of the Army.

====The First World War====
World War I began in 1914 between the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] (France, Great Britain, Russian Empire, Serbia), and the Triple Alliance (Germany, [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungary]], Ottoman Empire) and from 14 October 1915, Bulgaria. The war ended on  11 November 1918 with the capitulation of the Triple Alliance. On the 23 September 1915 the mobilization in Bulgaria began. On 14 October 1915 Bulgaria declared war against Serbia. Bulgaria kept fighting with the French and English army in Macedonia throughout the entire war. The war between Bulgaria and the Romanian Kingdom and her ally the Russian Empire began on the 1 September 1916. Bulgaria surrendered on  29 September 1918. [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine|The Neuilly Peace Treaty]] was signed on the 27 November 1919, and ratified on the 9 August 1920. 105,000 Bulgarian soldiers were killed, 150,000 were wounded, and 60,000 were disabled. Financial and physical losses amounted to 7 billion [[leva]], economic losses and debts equaled 100 billion [[leva]].

In September 1915 Captain Nedev was appointed procurement officer on the staff of the 8th Division in [[Stara Zagora]]. During the war he served at the division's headquarters. In the battles for [[Tutrakan]] he was the battery commander. In July 1916 he was the commander of the new howitzer battery, part of the 2nd heavy artillery regiment, fighting in [[Dobruja|Dobrudja]]. In 1917 Captain Nedev was the operational head of section to the staff of the army. As adjutant in the 9th Pleven’s infantry division he fought at the military positions for [[Dojran]] until the end of the war in 1918.

====After the First World War====
On 16 June 1919 Major Nedev was appointed as vice-chairman of the historical department to the staff of the army. This post was very close to his calling; at this point he collected the historical material for the books he would later write.

At the beginning of 1920 Nedev was the cabinet’s delegated military representative to the Occupying Commission in Bulgaria. Its task was to control the provisions of the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine|Neuilly Peace Treaty]], defining the territory, borders, reparations, and demilitarization. The government chose Nedev for his reputation as a truly loyal, brave, military patriot, fluent French, Italian and German. Thanks to his tact and diplomatic skills, and granted favorable conditions, he managed to negotiate a small territorial benefit; the southern border was moved a few kilometers into Greece’s territory.

In 1922 Nedev along with those who had not graduated from the Higher Military Schools in [[Saint Petersburg]] defended his doctoral thesis and was declared graduated from the ''Ecole de guerre''. In the same year he was appointed to the headquarters of the army and lectured on military history in the Sofia Military School.

Between 25 August 1923 and 13 September 1924 Lieutenant Colonel Nedev was the commander of the 18th Infantry Battalion in [[Veliko Tarnovo]]. In September 1924 he was commander of the tactical training on the staff of the 1st Infantry Battalion in Sofia. and in 1927 he became chief of staff.

From 1925 until 1928 Lieutenant Colonel Nedev was the head of the Military Intelligence in Bulgaria.

====Literary activity====
While defending [[Dojran]], Nedev came up with the idea to record the bravery of the Bulgarian soldiers of Pleven’s regiment. In 1921 he wrote the book ''The Dojran epic – 1915-1918''. It tells of the victory of Plevan's 9th infantry division, commanded by Major General [[Vladimir Vazov]]. The army fought on the southern front from 1915 to 1918 against French, English, Serbian, Russian and Greek soldiers. The book presents a number of battles, including that of 16 June 1917 between the 9th Pleven’s infantry division and the 22nd, 26th, and 30th English divisions. The English army advanced with 160 cannons, 11 mortars and 440 guns. Over the course of four days the British fired over 100,000 shells, but the results on their side were disappointing, keeping them from further advancement. The Bulgarian offence was so effective that the enemy’s army suffered heavy casualties.

In 1927 Nedev published his second book ''Bulgaria in the World War – 1915-1918'' a historical review, dedicated to "those who would continue the deeds of the whole Bulgarian nation". It book was reissued in 2001. In 1928 Nedev published the book ''The Liberation of Sofia'' a review of this unusual military operation in the winter of 1877.

In 1929  Nedev published his fourth book ''The Wars of Liberation – 1877-1878, 1885, 1912-1913, 1915-1918'', where he wrote a thorough review of the wars of the third Bulgarian Kingdom.

====Military attache in Rome, Ankara and Athens====
In 1930, Nedev was commander of the Juncer battalion of the Higher Military School. The same year he was nominated as [[military attache]] in Rome, Ankara and Athens (the headquarters were in Rome). He discovered that the Ottoman Empire had sold its barred record. Nedev knew that it contained very important documents about Bulgaria’s history. This archive was bought by the Bulgarian government following Nedev’s advice. Thus Levsky’s case (the most celebrated national hero) was brought back to Bulgaria.

After his return from Rome in 1932 Nikola Nedev was appointed commander of the 14th Macedonian Infantry Regiment in [[Blagoevgrad|Gorna Dzhumaya]]. In 1934 he was commander of the 8th Infantry Division in Stara Zagora. There, on 6 May 1936, he was promoted to the rank of major general. At the time in the 12th Infantry Regiment in Stara Zagora, forty young soldiers were accused of communist activity. The Judge Advocate demanded that they be sentenced to death. Nedev stood by his men and said that he as general, would die with his soldiers, showing the world that people could be sentenced to death for their beliefs. The punishment was cancelled.

At the end of 1935 General Nedev was commander of Pleven’s Garrison. He also led the 4th Military engineering group in Pleven. At the end of 1936 he retired from the army. He was appointed chairman of the Military History Commission, as well as chairman of the cycling Union. At this point he had a chance to collect documents for his future books.

====Minister in Kyoseivanov's cabinets====
From 14 November 1938 Nedev was Minister of Interior Affairs and Public Health in the cabinet of [[Georgi Kyoseivanov]]. He held this office from 23 October 1939 until 15 October 1940.

In November 1936, Germany, Italy and Japan signed a treaty agreeing to a common foreign policy. On 11 March 1938 Germany occupied Austria. On 30 September 1939 Germany occupied [[Sudetenland|Sudeteland]],and six months later she invaded Czechoslovakia. In 1939 Italy occupied Albania. On 23 August the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Ribentrop-Molotov Treaty]] was signed. Poland was divided between Germany and the USSR, and on the 1st of September WWII began. Bulgarian society was divided in two parts; those supporting Great Britain, France and USA, and those supporting Germany, Italy and Japan. The cabinet of Georgi Kyoseivanov remained neutral until 15 September. On 31 July 1938 Bulgaria signed the [[Balkan Pact|Balkan pact]] – its neighbors gave up the military restrictions of the Neuilly Treaty. [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Tsar Boris III]] disbanded Parliament.

At Hitler’s insistence, Bulgaria began its [[Holocaust in Bulgaria|genocide of Jews]] in 1939. Nedev twice requested an audience with Tsar Boris III and insisted that no Jewish men who risked their lives for Bulgaria’s freedom be sentenced to death. Thanks to his efforts a sailing vessel transporting Jews was not sunk in the Black sea.

Nikola Nedev was procurator of the Takvorian Tobacco Company for a year from 1 July 1941.

====After World War II====
After World War II, the new political forces in Bulgaria determined Major General Nikola Nedev to be a patriot and a humanist who typified the feats of the Bulgarian army. Despite that assessment, the communist government arrested him in 1951. His family was not informed of his whereabouts for four months. Nedev was held in a concentration camp along with the members of Bulgaria’s intelligencia – politicians, senior members of the military, ministers, and intellectuals. In 1954 he was released after three years of hard labor and deprived of his title and pension. Nedev kept his dignity; he thanked God he was alive, and forgave the communists "as they did not know what they had been doing".

'''Otto Eduard Neugebauer''' (May 26, 1899 – February 19, 1990) was an Austrian American [[mathematician]] and [[History of science|historian of science]] who became known for his research on the [[history of astronomy]] and the other [[exact sciences]] in [[Ancient history|antiquity]] and into the [[Middle Ages]]. By studying [[clay tablet]]s, he discovered that the ancient [[Babylonia]]ns knew much more about [[mathematics]] and [[astronomy]] than had been previously realized. The [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] has called Neugebauer "the most original and productive scholar of the history of the exact sciences, perhaps of the [[history of science]], of our age."

== Career ==

Neugebauer began as a mathematician, then turned to [[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptian]] and [[Babylonian mathematics]], and then took up the history of mathematical astronomy. In a career of sixty-five years, he largely created our current understanding of mathematical [[Babylonian astronomy|astronomy from Babylon]] and [[Egyptian astronomy|Egypt]], through [[Greco-Roman]] antiquity, [[Indian astronomy|to India]], [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Islam]], and [[Science in Medieval Western Europe|Europe of the Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. 

Neugebauer was born in [[Innsbruck]], Austria.  His father Rudolph Neugebauer was a railroad construction engineer and a collector and scholar of Oriental carpets. His parents died when he was quite young. During [[World War I]], Neugebauer enlisted in the Austrian Army and served as an artillery lieutenant on the Italian front and then in an Italian prisoner-of-war camp alongside fellow-countryman [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. In 1919, he entered the [[University of Graz]] in [[electrical engineering]] and [[physics]] and, in 1921, transferred to the [[University of Munich]]. From 1922 to 1924, he studied mathematics at the [[University of Göttingen]] under [[Richard Courant]], [[Edmund Landau]], and [[Emmy Noether]]. During 1924–25, he was at the [[University of Copenhagen]], where his interests changed to the history of Egyptian mathematics.

He returned to Göttingen and remained there until 1933.  His thesis ''Die Grundlagen der ägyptischen Bruchrechnung'' (The Fundamentals of Egyptian Calculation with Fractions) (Springer, 1926) was a mathematical analysis of the table in the [[Rhind Papyrus]]. In 1927, he received his [[venia legendi]] for the history of mathematics and served as [[Privatdozent]]. His first paper on Babylonian mathematics, in 1927, was an account of the origin of the [[sexagesimal]] system.

In 1929, Neugebauer founded ''Quellen und Studien zur Geschichte der Mathematik, Astronomie und Physik'' (QS), a Springer series devoted to the history of the mathematical sciences, in which he published extended papers on Egyptian computational techniques in arithmetic and geometry, including the [[Moscow Papyrus]], the most important text for geometry. Neugebauer had worked on the Moscow Papyrus in [[Leningrad]] in 1928.

In 1931, he founded the review journal [[Zentralblatt MATH|Zentralblatt für Mathematik und ihre Grenzgebiete]] (Zbl), his most important contribution to modern mathematics. When [[Hitler]] became chancellor in 1933, Neugebauer was asked to sign an oath of loyalty to the new government, but he refused and was promptly suspended from employment. In 1934, he joined the [[University of Copenhagen]] as full professor of mathematics. In 1936, he published a paper on the method of dating and analyzing texts using [[diophantine equation]]s. During 1935–37, he published a corpus of texts named ''Mathematische Keilschrift-Texte'' (MKT). MKT was a colossal work, in size, in detail, in depth, and its contents show that the riches of Babylonian mathematics far surpass anything one could imagine from a knowledge of Egyptian and [[Greek mathematics]]. He was an Invited Speaker of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1928 in Bologna and a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1936 in Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Neugebauer, O.|chapter=Über griechische Mathematik und ihr Verhältnis zur Vorgriechischen|title=''In:'' Comptes rendus du Congrès international des mathématiciens: Oslo, 1936|volume=vol. 1|pages=157–170|year=1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, after the Zentralblatt was taken over by the [[Nazism|Nazis]], he moved to the United States, joined the mathematics department at [[Brown University]], and founded [[Mathematical Reviews]].  He became an American citizen and remained at Brown for most of his career, founding the History of Mathematics Department there in 1947 and becoming University Professor.  Jointly with the American Assyriologist [[Abraham Sachs]], he published ''Mathematical Cuneiform Texts'' in 1945, and this has remained a standard English-language work on Babylonian mathematics. In 1967, he was awarded the [[Henry Norris Russell Lectureship]] by the [[American Astronomical Society]]. In 1977, he was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], and in 1979, he received the Award for Distinguished Service to Mathematics from the [[Mathematical Association of America]]. In 1984, he moved to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], where he had been a member since 1950.

Neugebauer was also interested in [[chronology]]. He was able to reconstruct the Alexandrian Christian calendar and its origin from the Alexandrian Jewish calendar as of about the 4th century, at least 200 years prior to any other source for either calendar. Thus, the Jewish calendar was derived by combining the 19-year cycle using the Alexandrian year with the seven-day week, and was then slightly modified by the Christians to prevent [[Easter]] from ever coinciding with [[Passover]]. The ecclesiastical calendar, considered by church historians to be highly scientific and deeply complex, turned out to be quite simple. In 1988, by studying a scrap of Greek [[papyrus]], Neugebauer discovered the most important single piece of evidence to date for the extensive transmission of Babylonian astronomy to the Greeks and for the continuing use of Babylonian methods for 400 years even after [[Ptolemy]] wrote the [[Almagest]]. His last paper, “From Assyriology to Renaissance Art,” published in 1989, detailed the history of a single astronomical parameter, the mean length of the [[synodic]] month, from [[cuneiform]] tablets, to the papyrus fragment just mentioned, to the Jewish calendar, to an early 15th-century [[book of hours]].

In 1986 Neugebauer was awarded the [[Balzan Prize]] "for his fundamental research into the exact sciences in the ancient world, in particular, on ancient Mesopotamian, Egyptian and [[Greek astronomy]], which has put our understanding of [[History of science in early cultures|ancient science]] on a new footing and illuminated its transmission to the classical and medieval worlds. For his outstanding success in promoting interest and further research in the history of science" (Motivation of the Balzan General Prize Committee). Neugebauer donated the prize money of 250,000 Swiss francs to the Institute for Advanced Study.

The noted physicist and astronomer [[Gerry Neugebauer]] at [[Caltech]] was his son.

'''Petras Klimas''' ({{audio|Petras Klimas.ogg|pronunciation}}, February 23, 1891 - January 16, 1969) was a [[Lithuania]]n diplomat, author, historian, and [[Signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania|one of the twenty signatories]] of the [[Act of Independence of Lithuania]].

Klimas attended law school at the [[University of Moscow]]. After graduating, he returned to [[Vilnius]] and served on the Lithuanian Central Relief Committee. He was elected to the [[Council of Lithuania]] in 1917, and signed the Act of Independence in 1918. Klimas went on to serve as the Lithuanian diplomatic envoy to [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], and [[Luxembourg]].

During the [[Interwar period]] Klimas published a number of scholarly works in Lithuanian and German language, including ''Russisch Litauen'' (Russian Lithuania), a study of Russian rule of Lithuania from 1795–1915; ''Der Werdegang des litauischen Staates'' (The Development of the Lithuanian State), describing the emergence of the Lithuanian state from 1915–1918; and ''Lietuvos žemės valdymo istorija'' (History of land ownership in Lithuania).

While he was serving on a diplomatic mission to [[Paris]] in 1940, the Lithuanian Legation was turned over to the [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Nazi]] occupational authorities in France arrested him in 1942, and he was sent to a [[concentration camp]] until 1943. He was released for a short while and returned to Lithuania, but was re-arrested in 1944 during the second Soviet occupation of Lithuania. This time he was sent to a concentration camp in [[List of concentration and internment camps#Russia and the Soviet Union|Siberia]] and spent ten years there. His health was permanently impaired until his death in 1969. He was buried in [[Petrašiūnai Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lnm.lt/ekspoziciniai-padaliniai/signataru-namai/lietuvos-nepriklausomybes-akto-signatarai/122.html?task=view|title=Lietuvos nacionalinis muziejus; Petras Klimas (1891–1969)|accessdate=2010-12-11|language=lt|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517182852/http://www.lnm.lt/ekspoziciniai-padaliniai/signataru-namai/lietuvos-nepriklausomybes-akto-signatarai/122.html?task=view|archivedate=2011-05-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ralaghan Man''' is an [[anthropomorphic]], carved wooden figure found in the bog of [[Ralaghan]], [[County Cavan]], Ireland, which dates back to the [[late bronze age]]. As of 2016, it was held in the collections of the [[National Museum of Ireland]].&lt;ref name="museum2016"&gt;{{cite web|publisher =National Museum of Ireland|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126064314/https://www.museum.ie/Archaeology/Exhibitions/Current-Exhibitions/Kingship-and-Sacrifice/New-Theory-of-Sacrifice | title = Kingship and Sacrifice - New Theory of Sacrifice |website=museum.ie| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160126064314/https://www.museum.ie/Archaeology/Exhibitions/Current-Exhibitions/Kingship-and-Sacrifice/New-Theory-of-Sacrifice | archivedate = 26 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Mahr]], keeper of Irish Antiquities in the National Museum in Dublin wrote in 1930; "''The figure was found, while cutting turf, under 3 to 4 feet of peat....It is made of yew, its height being 3 feet, 8 and five eighths inches''".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Mahr | first = Adolf | year = 1930 | title = A wooden idol from Ireland | journal = Antiquity |volume=4 |page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found in [[Ralaghan]] bog, which has since been drained, on a boundary. It is therefore currently regarded as a [[boundary marker]], though it has also been referred to as a [[votive offering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=Aidan|title=Exploring past people's interactions with wetland environments in Ireland.|url=https://www.academia.edu/448757/Exploring_Past_Peoples_Interactions_With_Wetland_Environments_In_Ireland|website=Academia.edu|publisher=ria.metapress.com|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although covered in cracks, the figure has strongly incised facial features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coles|first1=Bryony|title=Anthropomorphic Wooden Figures from Britain and Ireland|journal=Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society|date=1990|volume=56|issue=2050-2729|pages=315--333|doi=10.1017/S0079497X0000517X|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0079497X0000517X|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The left eye is slightly higher than the right, with the nose off-centre and possible damage to the left of the face. The pubic area features a gouged out hole (initially reported as drilled)&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; with some theorising that the figure was female (drawing associations with other figurative female representations, such as stone [[sheela na gig]] carvings).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Freitag | first = Barbara  | title = Sheela-na-gigs: Unravelling an Enigma | publisher = Sutton | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780750945981 | page = 107 | quote = ''Mainly because there is not the slightest indication of breasts on any of them, some archaeologists are inclined to believe that the Ralaghan and Dagenham figures represent males, and that the hole was meant for the insertion of a now missing penis. Since the absence of breasts in female idols is familiar, such an interpretation does not naturally follow. Indeed, the stones inside the pubic hole of the Ralaghan idol and the oval shape of the hole in the Dagenham figure, strongly indicative of female representation - and ill-designed, according to Coles, to hold a penis - would tell us otherwise''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other theories identify the figure as male, suggesting that the hole may have been used to hold a 'carved phallus' (since lost).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Williams| first = Mark | title = Ireland's Immortals: A History of the Gods of Irish Myth |publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780691157313 | page = 6 | quote = ''One [pomorphic wooden image] found in the bog of Ralaghan, Co.

'''Reception theory''' is a version of [[Reader-response criticism|reader response]] [[literary theory]] that emphasizes each particular reader's reception or interpretation in making meaning from a [[literary text]]. Reception theory is generally referred to as [[audience reception]] in the analysis of [[communications]] models. In literary studies, reception theory originated from the work of [[Hans-Robert Jauss]] in the late 1960s, and the most influential work was produced during the 1970s and early 1980s in Germany and the US (Fortier 132), with some notable work done in other Western European countries. A form of reception theory has also been applied to the study of [[historiography]].

The cultural theorist [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] was one of the main proponents of reception theory, first developed in his 1973 essay 'Encoding and Decoding in the Television Discourse'. His approach, called the [[encoding/decoding model of communication]], is a form of textual analysis that focuses on the scope of "negotiation" and "opposition" by the [[audience]]. This means that a "text"—be it a book, movie, or other creative work—is not simply passively accepted by the audience, but that the reader/viewer interprets the meanings of the text based on her or his individual cultural background and life experiences. In essence, the meaning of a text is not inherent within the text itself, but is created within the relationship between the text and the reader. 

Hall also developed a theory of encoding and decoding, [[Hall's Theory|Hall's theory]], which focuses on the communication processes at play in texts that are in televisual form. 

Reception theory has since been extended to the spectators of performative events, focusing predominantly on the theatre. Susan Bennett is often credited with beginning this discourse. Reception theory has also been applied to the history and analysis of landscapes, through the work of the landscape historian [[John Dixon Hunt]], as Hunt recognized that the survival of gardens and landscapes is largely related to their public reception.

==General==
A basic acceptance of the meaning of a specific text tends to occur when a group of readers have a shared cultural background and interpret the text in similar ways. It is likely that the less shared heritage a reader has with the artist, the less he or she will be able to recognise the artist's intended meaning, and it follows that if two readers have vastly different cultural and personal experiences, their reading of a text will vary greatly. [[Umberto Eco]] coined the term [[aberrant decoding]] to describe the case when the reader's interpretation differs from what the artist intended.&lt;ref name=Eco1972&gt;{{cite book|last=Eco|first=Umberto|title=Working Papers in Cultural Studies|chapter=Towards a semiotic inquiry into the television message|year=1972|publisher=University of Birmingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Landscape architecture ==
In literature, the interaction between text and reader occurs within a framework that controls and limits the interaction, through genre, tone, structure, and the social conditions of the reader and author, whereas in landscapes the interaction occurs through movement and viewing, framed by typology instead of genre and tone.  Instead of an "implied reader", reception theory of landscapes assumes an "implied visitor", who is an abstracted concatenation of responses of many visitors at different times.  

The theory recognizes that there is no single reading of a landscape that fulfills its entire potential, and that it is important to examine the motives of visitors and the factors influencing their visits (whether they read guidebooks about the place before visiting, or had strong feelings about the place or the designer, for instance).  

One key difference between reception theory in literature and reception theory in landscape architecture is that while literary works are accessible only to the imagination, physical landscapes are accessible to the senses as well as to the imagination.

Reception theoretical analysis of architecture differs from typical writing on the history and analysis of landscapes, which tends to focus on the intentions of the designers, the conditions leading to the creation of the design, and the building process.  Reception theory also tends to de-emphasize commonly used terms of description like 'formal' and 'picturesque', unless those terms were known to have meaning to landscape visitors themselves.

==Reception history ==
According to [[Harold Marcuse]],&lt;ref&gt;Harold Marcuse, [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], Department of History [http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/receptionhist.htm Reception History: Definition and Quotations.]&lt;/ref&gt; '''reception history''' is "the history of the meanings that have been imputed to historical events. It traces the different ways in which participants, observers, historians and other retrospective interpreters have attempted to make sense of events both as they unfolded and over time since then, to make those events meaningful for the present in which they lived and live."

Ganor noticed the unusual scale of the walls at Khirbet Qeiyafa while patrolling the area in 2003. Three years later he persuaded Garfinkel to take a look, and, after a preliminary dig in 2007, they began work in earnest in the summer of 2008. They have excavated only 4 percent of the six-acre settlement so far.&lt;ref&gt;The Associated Press - [http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/news/have-israeli-archaeologists-found-world-s-oldest-hebrew-inscription-1.256305 Have Israeli archaeologists found world's oldest Hebrew inscription?] Haaretz.com, Oct. 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

My mother is Jewish, so for some people I count as a Jew. But for me, being Jewish amounts to little more than just getting all the jokes in a Woody Allen movie. So, for the people for whom my Judaism is relevant, those people tend to be either overtly anti-Semitic or concerned about crazy conspiracies. The YouTube comments that reference my Judaism are completely crazy. For the most part, for anyone who is seriously engaging with my ideas, the fact that I was born to a Jewish woman who herself was not religious nor were her parents religious is completely irrelevant."&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised by his mother following his parents' divorce when he was aged two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/im-not-the-sexist-pig-youre-looking-for|title=I'm Not the Sexist Pig You're Looking For|website=www.samharris.org|access-date=April 23, 2016|date=2014-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris has stated that his upbringing was entirely secular, and his parents rarely discussed religion, though it was always a subject that interested him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/2007/01/05/january-5-2007-sam-harris-extended-interview/3736/ Sam Harris - Extended Interview]; [[PBS]]: ''[[Religion &amp; Ethics Newsweekly]]''; January 5, 2007; "I have an unremarkable history.

In my teens I just got interested in spiritual experience and what happens after death and just began to see that religion is really the discourse that treats these phenomena and started exploring meditation and other specifically Eastern brands of religious thinking, but I have studied Western religion as well and have been interested in religion for decades."&lt;/ref&gt; While a student at [[Stanford University]], Harris experimented with [[MDMA]], and has written and spoken about the insights he experienced under its influence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWEbGsXTWR0&amp;t=7m36s "Sam Harris."] (2008).

Though his original major was in English, he became interested in philosophical questions while at Stanford University after an experience with the [[empathogen–entactogen]] MDMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cogent Canine|title=First Time Sam Harris Took E|date=December 6, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFyg4blzlDM|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience led him to be interested in the idea that he might be able to achieve spiritual insights without the use of drugs.&lt;ref name="newsweek.com" /&gt; Leaving Stanford in his second year, a quarter after his psychedelic experience, he went to [[India]] and [[Nepal]], where he studied [[meditation]] with [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] religious teachers,&lt;ref name="newsweek.com"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Miller |first=Lisa |year=2010 |url=http://europe.newsweek.com/rationalist-sam-harris-believes-god-73859?rm=eu |title=Sam Harris Believes in God |publisher=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Segal&gt;Segal, David (October 26, 2006).

==Views==
===Criticism of Abrahamic religions===
Harris states that religion contains bad ideas, calling it "one of the most perverse misuses of intelligence we have ever devised".&lt;ref name=prob&gt;{{Cite news |author=Sam Harris |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/sam_harris/2007/10/the_problem_with_atheism.html |title=The Problem with Atheism |date=September 28, 2007 |accessdate=December 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He compares modern religious beliefs to the myths of the [[Ancient Greeks]], which were once accepted as fact but which are obsolete today. In a January 2007 interview with [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], Harris said, "We don't have a word for not believing in [[Zeus]], which is to say we are all atheists in respect to Zeus. And we don't have a word for not being an [[astrologer]]." He goes on to say that the term atheist will be retired only when "we all just achieve a level of intellectual honesty where we are no longer going to pretend to be certain about things we are not certain about".&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web |first=Sam |last=Harris |year=2005 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week1019/interview2.html |title=Interview: Sam Harris |publisher=[[PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris advocates a benign, noncoercive, corrective form of intolerance, distinguishing it from historic [[religious persecution]]. He promotes a conversational intolerance, in which personal convictions are scaled against evidence, and where intellectual honesty is demanded equally in religious views and non-religious views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Harris, Sam |date= |time=1:00:00 |title=Does God Exist?

====Islam====
[[File:Sam Harris-20100211.jpg|thumb|Harris speaking in 2010 at [[TED (conference)|TED]] ]]
Harris considers Islam to be "especially belligerent and inimical to the norms of civil discourse", relative to other world religions. He asserts that the "dogmatic commitment to ''using'' violence to defend one’s faith, both from within and without" to varying degrees, is a central Islamic doctrine that is found in few other religions to the same degree, and that "this difference has consequences in the real world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/response-to-controversy |title=Response to Controversy |last=Harris |first=Sam |date=June 21, 2014 |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, after the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]], Harris wrote, "The idea that Islam is a 'peaceful religion hijacked by extremists' is a dangerous fantasy—and it is now a particularly dangerous fantasy for Muslims to indulge. It is not at all clear how we should proceed in our dialogue with the Muslim world, but deluding ourselves with euphemisms is not the answer.  It now appears to be a truism in foreign policy circles that real reform in the Muslim world cannot be imposed from the outside.  But it is important to recognize why this is so—it is so because the Muslim world is utterly deranged by its religious tribalism. In confronting the religious literalism and ignorance of the Muslim world, we must appreciate how terrifyingly isolated Muslims have become in intellectual terms."&lt;ref name="Indi1"&gt;Taylor, Jerome (April 12, 2013).

[[The Raw Story]]&lt;/ref&gt; He states that his criticism of the religion is aimed not at Muslims as people, but at the doctrine of [[Islam]].

Harris wrote a response to controversy over his criticism of Islam, which also aired on a debate hosted by ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' on whether critics of Islam are [[Islamophobia#Criticism of term and use|unfairly labeled]] as bigots:
{{quote|Is it really true that the sins for which I hold Islam accountable are "committed at least to an equal extent by many other groups, especially [my] own"? ... The freedom to poke fun at Mormonism is guaranteed [not by the First Amendment but] by the fact that Mormons do not dispatch assassins to silence their critics or summon murderous hordes in response to satire. ... Can any reader of this page imagine the staging of a similar play [to ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]''] about Islam in the United States, or anywhere else, in the year 2013? ... At this moment in history, there is only one religion that systematically stifles free expression with credible threats of violence. The truth is, we have already lost our [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights with respect to Islam—and because they brand any observation of this fact a symptom of Islamophobia, Muslim apologists like Greenwald are largely to blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/segment/islam-islamophobia-new-atheist-sam-harris-richard-dawkins/51658aac02a76018a30001ed|title=Huffington Post|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samharris.org/site/full_text/response-to-controversy2 Response to Controversy] Version 2.3 (April 7, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Critics of the New Atheists such as [[Glenn Greenwald]] claim that "[Harris] and others like him spout and promote Islamophobia under the guise of rational atheism."&lt;ref name="greenwald"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Greenwald |first1=Glenn |authorlink1=Glenn Greenwald |title=Sam Harris, the New Atheists, and anti-Muslim animus |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/03/sam-harris-muslim-animus |accessdate=17 October 2018 |agency=The Guardian |date=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris, however, has criticized the way in which the term "[[Islamophobia]]" is commonly used. "My criticism of Islam is a criticism of beliefs and their consequences," he wrote following a controversial clash with [[Ben Affleck]] in October 2014 on the show ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', "but my fellow liberals reflexively view it as an expression of intolerance toward people." During an email exchange with Greenwald, Harris argued that "Islamophobia is a term of propaganda designed to protect Islam from the forces of secularism by conflating all criticism of it with racism and xenophobia. And it is doing its job, because people like you have been taken in by it."&lt;ref name="Indi1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Harris |first=Sam |title=Can Liberalism Be Saved From Itself? |url=http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/can-liberalism-be-saved-from-itself |accessdate=December 26, 2014 |location=London|date=2014-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Catholicism ====
In response to the report published by the Irish government's [[Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse]] and other revelations of [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|child abuse by Catholic priests]], Harris wrote: "The evidence suggests the misery of these children was facilitated and concealed by the hierarchy of the Catholic Church at every level, up to and including the prefrontal cortex of [Pope [[Benedict XVI]]]." Harris has criticized the Catholic Church's structure and forced [[celibacy]] within its ranks for attracting pedophiles, and blames its opposition to the use of contraception for poverty, shorter lifespans, and the proliferation of [[HIV/AIDS]]. Furthermore, he asserts that the Catholic Church has spent "two millennia demonizing human sexuality to a degree unmatched by any other institution, declaring the most basic, healthy, mature, and consensual behaviors taboo."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samharris.org/site/full_text/brin Bringing the Vatican to Justice]; SamHarris.org; May 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
{{See also|Criticism of Judaism|Criticism of the Talmud|Criticism of Moses}}
In ''The End of Faith'', Harris is critical of the Jewish faith and its followers:

{{quote|The gravity of Jewish suffering over the ages, culminating in the Holocaust, makes it almost impossible to entertain any suggestion that Jews might have brought their troubles upon themselves. This is, however, in a rather narrow sense, the truth. […] the ideology of Judaism remains a lightning rod for intolerance to this day. […] Jews, insofar as they are religious, believe that they are bearers of a unique covenant with God. As a consequence, they have spent the last two thousand years collaborating with those who see them as different by seeing themselves as irretrievably so. Judaism is as intrinsically divisive, as ridiculous in its literalism, and as at odds with the civilizing insights of modernity as any other religion. Jewish settlers, by exercising their "freedom of belief" on contested land, are now one of the principal obstacles to peace in the Middle East.}}

Regarding Israel and Judaism, Harris has said, "I don't think Israel should exist as a Jewish state. I think it is obscene, irrational and unjustifiable to have a state organized around a religion. So I don't celebrate the idea that there's a Jewish homeland in the Middle East. I certainly don't support any Jewish claims to real estate based on the Bible. Though I just said that I don't think Israel should exist as a Jewish state, the justification for such a state is rather easy to find. We need look no further than the fact that the rest of the world has shown itself eager to murder the Jews at almost every opportunity. So, if there were going to be a state organized around protecting members of a single religion, it certainly should be a Jewish state. Now, friends of Israel might consider this a rather tepid defense, but it's the strongest one I've got. I think the idea of a religious state is ultimately untenable."&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Sam (July 27, 2014).

===On atheism===
Harris has been referred to, along with Daniel Dennett, Richard Dawkins, and Christopher Hitchens, as one of the "new atheists", but he considers the term "atheist" to be problematic. He said, "while I am now one of the public voices of atheism, I never thought of myself as an atheist before being inducted to speak as one [...] I think that 'atheist' is a term that we do not need, in the same way that we don't need a word for someone who rejects astrology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Harris |first1=Sam |title=The Problem with Atheism |url=http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-problem-with-atheism |website=Sam Harris Blog |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=October 2, 2007|date=2007-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On spirituality===
Harris holds that there is "nothing irrational about seeking the states of mind that lie at the core of many religions. Compassion, awe, devotion, and feelings of oneness are surely among the most valuable experiences a person can have."&lt;ref name="newsweek.com" /&gt;

Harris rejects the dichotomy between religious spirituality on the one hand and scientific rationality on the other, and favors a middle path that preserves spirituality and science, but does not involve religion.&lt;ref name="clothier"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clothier|first1=Peter|title='Waking Up', by Sam Harris: A Book Review|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/waking-up-by-sam-harris-a_b_8079028.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=October 1, 2017|date=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that spirituality should be understood in light of scientific disciplines like [[neuroscience]] and [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="clothier"/&gt; Science, he contends, can show how to maximize human well-being, but may fail to answer certain questions about the nature of being, answers to some of which he says are discoverable directly through our experience.&lt;ref name="clothier"/&gt; His conception of spirituality does not involve a belief in God.&lt;ref name="h-smith"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Holly|title=Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion|url=http://www.washingtonindependentreviewofbooks.com/bookreview/executive-director-at-the-common-good|publisher=Washington Independent Review of Books|accessdate=October 2, 2017|date=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion]]'' (2014), Harris describes his experience with [[Dzogchen]], a [[Tibetan Buddhist]] meditation practice, and recommends it to his readers.&lt;ref name="clothier"/&gt; He writes that the purpose of spirituality (as he defines it – he concedes that the term's uses are diverse and sometimes indefensible) is to become aware that our sense of self is illusory, and says this realization brings both happiness and insight into the nature of [[consciousness]].&lt;ref name="clothier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kirkus"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion |journal=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |date=August 29, 2014 |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sam-harris/waking-up-guide-to-spirituality/ |accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process of realization, he argues, is based on experience and is not contingent on [[faith]].&lt;ref name="clothier"/&gt;

===Science and morality===
In his third book, ''[[The Moral Landscape]]: How Science Can Determine Human Values'', Harris says that "Human well-being is not a random phenomenon. It depends on many factors—ranging from genetics and neurobiology to sociology and economics." Harris says that it is time to promote a [[science of morality|scientific approach to normative morality]], rejecting the idea that religion determines what is good. He believes that once scientists begin proposing moral norms in papers, supernatural moral systems will join "[[astrology]], [[witchcraft]] and [[Greek mythology]] on the scrapheap".&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=Harris, Sam |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20827822.100-morality-we-can-send-religion-to-the-scrapheap.html |title=Morality: 'We can send religion to the scrap heap.' |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free will===
Harris says the idea of free will "cannot be mapped on to any conceivable reality" and is incoherent.&lt;ref&gt;Pardi, Paul (May 15, 2012). [http://www.philosophynews.com/post/2012/05/15/An-Analysis-of-Sam-Harris-Free-Will.aspx "An Analysis of Sam Harris' Free Will"].

I also believe that the conventional illusion of free will can be dispelled -- not merely ignored, tinkered with, or set on new foundations.|date=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Harris, science "reveals you to be a biochemical puppet."&lt;ref&gt;Nahmias, Eddy (August 13, 2012). [https://www.bigquestionsonline.com/content/does-contemporary-neuroscience-support-or-challenge-reality-free-will "Does Contemporary Neuroscience Support or Challenge the Reality of Free Will?"] Big Questions Online.&lt;/ref&gt; People's thoughts and intentions, Harris says, "emerge from background causes of which we are unaware and over which we exert no conscious control." Every choice we make is made as a result of preceding causes. These choices we make are determined by those causes, and are therefore not really choices at all. Nevertheless Harris maintains that the absence of free will does not erode the distinction between voluntary and involuntary actions, arguing that intentions tell a lot about the global attributes of a person's brain. Harris argues that this realization about the human mind does not undermine morality or diminish the importance of social and political freedom, but it can and should change the way we think about some of the most important questions in life.

===Social and political views===
Harris describes himself as a liberal, and states that he supports raising [[graduated income tax|taxes]] on the very wealthy, the [[Drug liberalization|decriminalizing of drugs]] and [[same-sex marriage]]. He was critical of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s [[war in Iraq]], fiscal policy, and treatment of science. However, he believes liberals dangerously downplay the threat posed by [[Islamic fundamentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Sam (September 18, 2006).

During the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]], Harris supported [[Hillary Clinton]] in the Democratic Party presidential primaries against [[Bernie Sanders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sam Harris Q&amp;A: "Why I'm Voting For Hillary Clinton", Feb 18, 2016|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and despite calling her "a terribly flawed candidate for the presidency," he favored her in the general election and came out strongly in opposition to [[Donald Trump]]'s candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Sam.

In April 2017, Harris stirred considerable controversy by hosting the social scientist [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]] on his podcast, discussing topics including the [[heritability of IQ]] and [[race and intelligence]].&lt;ref name="harris-ekeal"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Harris |first1=Sam |title=Ezra Klein: Editor-at-Large |url=https://samharris.org/ezra-klein-editor-chief/ |website=SamHarris.org |accessdate=16 October 2018 |date=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris stated the invitation was out of indignation at a violent protest against Murray at [[Middlebury College]] the month before and not out of particular interest in the material at hand.&lt;ref name="harris-ekeal"/&gt; The podcast garnered significant criticism, for instance from ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]''&lt;ref name="vox-thn"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Turkheimer |first1=Eric |author-link1=Eric Turkheimer |last2=Harden |first2=Kathryn Paige |last3=Nisbett |first3=Richard E. |author-link3=Richard E.

==Career==
===Writings and media appearances===
Harris's writing focuses on [[neuroscience]] and [[criticism of religion]], for which he is best known. He formerly blogged for the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the ''[[Huffington Post]]'', and ''[[Truthdig]]''. His articles have appeared in publications such as ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', the ''[[Boston Globe]]'', and the British national newspaper ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.samharris.org/site/about/ "About Sam Harris"]. Sam Harris. Retrieved May 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris has made numerous TV and radio appearances, including on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', ''[[ABC News]]'', ''[[Tucker (television program)|Tucker]]'', ''[[Book TV]]'', [[NPR]], ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher|Real Time]]'', ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', and ''[[The Daily Show]]''. In 2005, Harris appeared in the documentary film ''[[The God Who Wasn't There]]''. Harris was a featured speaker at the 2006 conference ''[[Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival]]''. He made two presentations and participated in the ensuing panel discussions. Harris has also appeared a number of times on the ''[[Point of Inquiry]]'' radio podcast. Harris engaged in a lengthy debate with [[Andrew Sullivan]] on the internet forum ''[[Beliefnet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Sam; Sullivan, Andrew (January 16, 2007). [http://www.beliefnet.com/story/209/story_20904.html "Is Religion 'Built Upon Lies'?"] [[Beliefnet]].&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, Harris debated with the evangelical pastor [[Rick Warren]] for ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Sam; Warren, Rick (April 8, 2007). [http://www.newsweek.com/newsweek-poll-90-believe-god-97611 "NEWSWEEK Poll: 90% Believe in God"]. ''[[Newsweek]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, he debated [[William Lane Craig]] on whether there can be an [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] [[morality]] without [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Schneider, Nathan |title=The New Theist |url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-New-Theist/140019/ |date=July 1, 2013 |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The God Debate |author=Harris, Sam |url=http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-god-debate |publisher=Sam Harris |date=August 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently serves on the Advisory Board of the [[Secular Coalition for America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.secular.org/board Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Waking Up'' podcast===
In September 2013, Harris began the ''Waking Up'' podcast, in which he discusses his views, responds to critics, and interviews guests. The podcasts, having started with very short posts, now vary in length anywhere from 1 hour to over 4 hours. The podcast has no regular release schedule, although the frequency of releases has increased over time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |title=Waking Up with Sam Harris |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/waking-up-with-sam-harris/id733163012?mt=2 |website=iTunes – Podcasts |accessdate=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the UK ''[[Business Insider]]'' included it in their list of "8 podcasts that will change how you think about human behavior" and ''[[PC Magazine]]'' included it in their list of "Podcasts You Should Download Now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=8 podcasts that will change how you think about human behavior|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/podcasts-change-how-you-understand-human-behavior-2017-1/#ted-radio-hour-1|website=uk.businessinsider.com|publisher=Business Insider Inc.|accessdate=April 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Podcasts You Should Download Now|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2471753,00.asp|website=pcmag.com|publisher=Ziff Davis, LLC.

After discussing [[Peter Singer|Peter Singer's]] drowning child thought experiment and the philosophy of [[effective altruism]] with [[William MacAskill]] on the podcast, Harris pledged to donate several thousand dollars of the revenue generated by each new podcast episode to effective charitable organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/being-good-and-doing-good|title=Being Good and Doing Good|last=Harris|first=Sam|access-date=June 10, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroscience===
Building on his interests in belief and religion, Harris completed a PhD in [[cognitive neuroscience]] at [[UCLA]].&lt;ref name=Segal /&gt;&lt;ref name="HealyLATimes" /&gt; He used [[fMRI]] to explore whether the brain responses differ between sentences that subjects judged as true, false, or undecidable, across a wide range of categories including autobiographical, mathematical, geographical, religious, ethical, semantic, and factual statements.&lt;ref name="HarrisAnnNeurol2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = S. | last2 = Sheth | first2 = S.

In another study, Harris and colleagues examined the neural basis of religious and [[non-religious]] belief using fMRI.&lt;ref name="HarrisPLOSOne2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = S. | last2 = Kaplan | first2 = J. T. | last3 = Curiel | first3 = A. | last4 = Bookheimer | first4 = S. Y. | last5 = Iacoboni | first5 = M. | last6 = Cohen | first6 = M.

For both groups, statements of belief (sentences judged as either true or false) were associated with increased activation of [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]], a region of the brain involved in emotional judgment, processing uncertainty, assessing rewards and thinking about oneself.&lt;ref name="HealyLATimes" /&gt;  A "comparison of all religious trials to all nonreligious trials produced a wide range of signal differences throughout the brain," and the processing of religious belief and empirical belief differed in significant ways. The regions associated with increased activation in response to religious stimuli included the [[anterior insula]], the [[ventral striatum]], the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], and the posterior medial cortex.&lt;ref name="HarrisPLOSOne2009" /&gt;

In another study published in 2016, Harris and his team probed the neural systems involved in maintaining one's political beliefs in the face of opposing evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39589#abstract|title=Neural correlates of maintaining one's political beliefs in the face of counterevidence|date=December 23, 2016|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|pages=39589|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|doi=10.1038/srep39589|pmid=28008965|pmc=5180221|last1=Kaplan|first1=Jonas T.|last2=Gimbel|first2=Sarah I.|last3=Harris|first3=Sam|bibcode=2016NatSR...639589K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meditation==
Harris is a proponent of secular meditation practices.&lt;ref name="Blog"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/how-to-meditate |title=How to Meditate |accessdate=June 19, 2017|date=2011-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His practice developed from [[Vipassana]] and [[Dzogchen]]. He states that the key aim of [[meditation]] is to enable its practitioners to see that the feeling of self is an illusion. In September 2018 Harris released a meditation app, Waking Up with Sam Harris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/waking-up-with-sam-harris/id1307736395?mt=8 | title=Waking up with Sam Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Harris is a student of the martial arts and practices [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]].&lt;ref name="Free Will"&gt;{{cite book |title=Free Will |publisher=Free Press |author=Harris, Sam |year=2012 |isbn=978-1451683400}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BJJ"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/05/the-atheist-who-strangled-me/309292/ |title=The Atheist Who Strangled Me |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=April 24, 2013 |accessdate=August 11, 2014 |author=Wood, Graeme}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris was at one point a vegetarian, but gave it up after six years, citing health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLFnJ8pWh8g|title=Can You Defend Eating Meat with Sam Harris|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he returned to vegetarianism for ethical reasons, with the intention of eventually going vegan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/ask-me-anything-2|title=Ask Me Anything #2|first=Sam|last=Harris|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supported the idea of [[cultured meat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meat Without Misery A Conversation with Uma Valeti|url=https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/meat-without-murder|accessdate=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris has been reluctant to discuss personal details such as where he now lives, citing security reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Piccalo |first=Gina |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/oct/02/entertainment/et-harris |title=Oh, dear God—it's him again |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=October 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Harris married Annaka Harris, an editor of nonfiction and scientific books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.project-reason.org/about/individual_member/2819/ "Project Reason Trustees / Advisory Board"].

In a '''support group''', members provide each other with various types of help, usually nonprofessional and nonmaterial, for a particular shared, usually burdensome, characteristic. Members with the same issues can come together for sharing coping strategies, to feel more empowered and for a sense of community. The help may take the form of providing and evaluating relevant information, relating personal experiences, listening to and accepting others' experiences, providing sympathetic understanding and establishing [[social network]]s. A support group may also work to inform the public or engage in advocacy.

==History==
Formal support groups may appear to be a modern phenomenon, but they supplement traditional [[fraternal organization]]s such as [[Freemasonry]] in some respects, and may build on certain supportive functions (formerly) carried out in (extended) [[family|families]].

Other types of groups formed to support causes, including causes outside of themselves, are more often called ''[[advocacy groups]]'', ''interest groups'', ''lobby groups'', ''pressure groups'' or ''promotional groups''.  [[Trade union]]s and many environmental groups, for example, are interest groups.  The term ''support group'' in this article refers to peer-to-peer support.

==Maintaining contact==
Support groups maintain interpersonal contact among their members in a variety of ways. Traditionally, groups have met in person in sizes that allowed conversational interaction. Support groups also maintain contact through printed newsletters, telephone chains, internet forums, and mailing lists. Some support groups are exclusively [[On-line and off-line|online]] (see below).

Membership in some support groups is formally controlled, with admission requirements and membership fees. Other groups are "open" and allow anyone to attend an advertised meeting, for example, or to participate in an online forum.

==Management by peers or professionals==
A '''self-help support group''' is fully organized and managed by its members, who are commonly volunteers and have personal experience in the subject of the group's focus. These groups may also be referred to as ''fellowships'', ''peer support groups'', ''lay organizations'', ''mutual help groups'', or ''mutual aid self-help groups''. Most common are 12-step groups such as [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] and [[self-help groups for mental health]].

'''Professionally operated support groups''' are facilitated by professionals who most often do not share the problem of the members,&lt;ref name = "APA"&gt;''APA Dictionary of Psychology'', 1st ed., Gary R. VandenBos, ed., Washington: American Psychological Association, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; such as social workers, psychologists, or members of the clergy. The facilitator controls discussions and provides other managerial service. Such professionally operated groups are often found in institutional settings, including [[hospitals]], [[drug rehabilitation|drug-treatment centers]] and [[prison|correctional facilities]]. These types of support group may run for a specified period of time, and an attendance fee is sometimes charged.&lt;ref name = "APA"/&gt;

==Types==
In the case of a [[disease]], an [[cultural identity|identity]] or a pre-disposition, for example, a support group will provide information, act as a clearing-house for experiences, and may serve as a [[public relations]] voice for sufferers, other members, and their families. Compare [[Mensa International]] and [[gay pride]], for example.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

For more temporary conditions, such as bereavement or the problems of ex-[[cult]] members, a support group may veer more towards helping those involved to overcome or move "beyond" their condition/experience.

Some support groups and conditions for which such groups may be formed are:

==Online support groups==
Since at least 1982, the [[Internet]] has provided a venue for support groups. Discussing online self-help support groups as the precursor to e-therapy, Martha Ainsworth notes that "the enduring success of these groups has firmly established the potential of computer-mediated communication to enable discussion of sensitive personal issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metanoia.org/imhs/history.htm |title= E-Therapy: History and Survey |accessdate= 2008-04-15 |last= Ainsworth |first= Martha |work= |publisher= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study of the effectiveness of online support groups among patients with head and neck cancer, longer participation in online support groups were found to result in a better health-related quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Algtewi|first=Eamar|last2=Owens|first2=Janine|last3=Baker|first3=Sarah R.|date=2017-04-17|title=Online support groups for head and neck cancer and health-related quality of life|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11136-017-1575-8|journal=Quality of Life Research|volume=26|issue=9|pages=2351–2362|doi=10.1007/s11136-017-1575-8|issn=0962-9343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appropriate groups still difficult to find===
A researcher from [[University College London]] says the lack of qualitative directories, and the fact that many support groups are not listed by search engines can make finding an appropriate group difficult.&lt;ref name="Potts 2005"&gt;{{cite journal| last      =Potts| first      =Henry W. W.| last2      =| first2      =| date      =| title      =Online support groups: An overlooked resource for patients| url      =http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/archive/00001406/01/Online_support_groups.pdf| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20060309233843/http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/archive/00001406/01/Online_support_groups.pdf| dead-url =yes| archive-date =2006-03-09| journal      =He@lth Information on the Internet| publisher      =| volume      =44| issue      =1| pages      =6–8| doi      =| pmc      =| pmid      =| name-list-format      =vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, he does say that the medical community needs "to understand the use of personal experiences rather than an evidence-based approach... these groups also impact on how individuals ''use'' information.  They can help people learn how to find and use information: for example, users swap Web sites and ''discuss'' Web sites."

It is not difficult to find an online support group, but it is hard to find a good one.  In the article ''What to Look for in Quality Online Support Groups'', John M. Grohol gives tips for evaluating online groups and states: "In good online support groups, members stick around long after they've received the support they were seeking. They stay because they want to give others what they themselves found in the group. Psychologists call this ''high group cohesion'', and it is the pinnacle of group achievement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://psychcentral.com/archives/support_groups.htm  |title= What to Look for in Quality Online Support Groups |accessdate= 2008-04-15  |last= Grohol |first= John M.  |date= May 2004 |work= |publisher= |pages= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits and pitfalls===

Several studies have shown the importance of the Internet in providing social support, particularly to groups with chronic health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Powell | first = John |author2=Aileen Clarke  | year = 2002 | title = The WWW of the World Wide Web: Who, What, and Why? | journal = Journal of Medical Internet Research | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = e4| publisher = | location = | doi = 10.2196/jmir.4.1.e4 | bibcode = | oclc = | id = | url = http://www.jmir.org/2002/1/e4 | format = guest editorial | accessdate = 2008-04-15 | quote = | pmid = 11956036 | pmc = 1761925  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in cases of uncommon ailments, a sense of community and understanding in spite of great geographical distances can be important, in addition to sharing of knowledge.

Online support groups, online communities for those affected by a common problem, give mutual support and provide information, two often inseparable features.  They are, according to Henry Potts of University College London, "an overlooked resource for patients."   Many studies have looked at the ''content of messages'', while what matters is the effect that ''participation'' in the group has on the individual.  Potts complains that research on these groups has lagged behind, particularly on the groups which are set up by the people with the problems, rather than by researchers and healthcare professionals.  User-defined groups can share the sort of practical knowledge that healthcare professionals can overlook, and they also impact on how individuals find, interpret and use information.&lt;ref name="Potts 2005"/&gt;

There are many benefits to online support groups that have been found through research studies. Although online support group users are not required to be anonymous, a study conducted by Baym (2010) finds that anonymity is beneficial to those who are lonely or anxious. This does not pertain to some people seeking support groups, because not all are lonely and/or anxious, but for those who are, online support groups are a great outlet where one can feel comfortable honestly expressing themselves because the other users do not know who they are.

A study was conducted by Walther and Boyd (2000) and they found a common trend to why people find online support groups appealing. First, the social distance between members online reduced embarrassment and they appreciated the greater range of expertise offered in the larger online social network. Next, they found that anonymity increased one's confidence in providing support to others and decreased embarrassment. The users of the social support websites were more comfortable being able to reread and edit their comments and discussion forum entries before sending them, and they have access to the website any time during the day. Each of these characteristics of online support groups are not offered when going to an in-person support group.

In a study conducted by Gunther Eysenbach, John Powell, Marina Englesakis, Carlos Rizo, and Anita Stern (2004), the researchers found it difficult to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of online peer-to-peer support groups. In online support groups, people must have the desire to support and help each other, and many times participants go on the sites in order to get help themselves or are limited to a certain subgroup.

An additional benefit to online support groups is that participation is asynchronous.  This means that it is not necessary for all participants to be logged into the forum simultaneously in order to communicate.  An experience or question can be posted and others can answer questions or comment on posts whenever they are logged in and have an appropriate response.  This characteristic allows for participation and mass communication without having to worry about time constraints. Additionally, there are 24-hour chat rooms and spaces for focused conversation at all times of the day or night. This allows users to get the support they need whenever they need it, while remaining comfortable and, if they so wish, anonymous.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13152">The [[hexagonal]] [[snowflake]], a [[Ice crystal|crystalline]] formation of [[ice]], has intrigued people throughout history. This is a [[chronology]] of interest and research into snowflakes. Artists, philosophers, and scientists have wondered at their shape, recorded them by hand or in photographs, and attempted to recreate hexagonal snowflakes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4044">{{short description|1587 English play by an unknown author}}
{{italic title}}
The '''''Ur-Hamlet''''' (the German prefix ''[[wikt:ur-|Ur-]]'' means "[[wikt:primordial|primordial]]") is a play by an unknown author, thought to be either [[Thomas Kyd]] or [[William Shakespeare]]. No copy of the play, dated by scholars to the second half of 1587, survives today. The play is known to have been staged in London, more specifically at The Burbages Shoreditch Playhouse as recalled by Elizabethan author [[Thomas Lodge]]. The play is known to have a character named Hamlet; the only other known character from the play is a ghost who cries, "Hamlet, revenge!"

== Related writings ==
What relation the ''Ur-Hamlet'' bears to Shakespeare's more commonly known play ''[[Hamlet]]'' is unclear: it may contain events supposed to have occurred before Shakespeare's tragedy or it may be an early version of that play; the [[Hamlet Q1|First Quarto]] in particular is thought perhaps to have been influenced by the ''Ur-Hamlet''.

Some scholars believe that the ''Ur-Hamlet'' had influence from the German work ''[[Fratricide Punished|Der bestrafte Brudermord]].''

==Authorship theories==
Because [[Nashe]] apparently alludes to [[Thomas Kyd]] in the same passage of his ''Menaphon'' introduction, and because of similarities between Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' and Kyd's ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'', Kyd is believed by many to be the author of the lost ''Ur-Hamlet''.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, p.83–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain other scholars believe that the play is an early version of Shakespeare's own play, pointing to the survival of Shakespeare's version in three quite different early texts, [[Hamlet Q1|Q1]] (1603), Q2 (1604) and F (1623), suggesting the possibility that it was revised by the author over a period of many years. While the exact relationship of the short and apparently primitive text of Q1 to the later published texts is not resolved, [[Hardin Craig]] has suggested that it may represent an earlier draft of the play and hence would confirm that the ''Ur-Hamlet'' is in fact merely an earlier draft of Shakespeare's play. This view is held in some form or another by [[Harold Bloom]],&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, pp. xiii, 383&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Alexander,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Peter vol.4 of ''The Heritage of Shakespeare: Tragedies'', p. 638&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andrew Cairncross]], who stated that "It may be assumed, until a new case can be shown to the contrary, that Shakespeare's ''Hamlet'' and no other is the play mentioned by Nashe in 1589 and [[Henslowe]] in 1594."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cairncross|first=Andrew Scott|title=The Problem of Hamlet: A Solution|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|year=1936|oclc=301819}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Jenkins (Shakespeare scholar)|Harold Jenkins]], in his 1982 Arden edition, dismisses this assertion.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, p. 84, note 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==European beginnings==

Szmuness was born in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] on 12 March 1919. He studied [[medicine]] in [[Italy]], but he returned to be with his family around the Nazi German invasion of Poland in 1939. As the Germans and Soviets occupied Poland, Szmuness was separated from his family, who were later killed by the Germans. Trapped in the Communist-occupied part of Poland, Szmuness traveled eastward to escape the advancing Nazis. He asked the Soviets to let him fight the Germans but was sent to [[Siberia]] as a prisoner.

Following a year of hard labour in the prison camp, Szmuness was appointed head of sanitary conditions. He later became the head epidemiologist in the local district. After release from detention in 1946, Szmuness completed his medical education at the University of [[Tomsk]] in [[Siberia]], and earned a degree in [[epidemiology]] from the [[University of Kharkov]].

Szmuness married a Russian woman, Maya, and in 1959 was allowed to return to Poland. There, he continued his education at the University of Lublin and worked as an epidemiologist in municipal and regional health departments.

Szmuness's colleague [[Aaron Kellner]] reports that the Polish authorities granted Szmuness a vacation at a rest home, where he shared a room with a [[Catholic]] priest, [[Pope John Paul II|Karol Wojtyła]], and began a longtime correspondence with him. Karol Wojtyła would later become [[Pope John Paul II]].

==Emigration  and life in the United States==

In 1969, Szmuness, his wife and their daughter Helena were permitted to attend a scientific meeting in [[Italy]]. Upon arriving, Szmuness defected and emigrated to [[New York City]] in the United States for religious and political reasons. Through the intervention of [[Walsh McDermott]], a professor of public health at [[New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center]], Szmuness was hired by the [[New York City Blood Center]]. Because doctors from abroad are not usually accredited in the [[United States]], Szmuness began as a laboratory technician, but his skills were quickly recognized, and, within two years, Szmuness headed his own lab. A separate department of epidemiology at the Center was created for him, and he also became a full professor at the [[Columbia University]] School of Public Health. According to Aaron Kellner, President of the Center, within five years of arriving in New York, Szmuness became "an international figure in epidemiology and the field of hepatitis".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

Szmuness died of [[lung cancer]] in 1982.

== Hepatitis B ==

Szmuness first became interested in the [[hepatitis B]] virus when his wife, Maya, was nearly killed by the liver disease caused by the virus,&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; which she contracted through a blood transfusion. In New York, Szmuness investigated the [[Natural history of disease|natural history]] of hepatitis B. A vaccine was produced in the late 1970s, and Szmuness designed and conducted [[vaccine trials]] to determine its efficacy. Over 1000 male homosexuals participated in the trials; they were chosen as participants because they "had been found to have a risk of developing hepatitis B that is 10 times greater than that for the population in general".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

==AIDS Theory==
A [[Discredited AIDS origins theories|highly controversial theory]] suggested that HIV-contaminated Hepatitis B vaccine trials in 1978 were responsible for the original spread of AIDS in the United States by infecting gay men in [[New York City]] with [[HIV]]. Evidence as to the presence of HIV in Szmuness's lab, or a mechanism for this introduction have not been offered, and scientific data strongly suggests that [[Origin of AIDS#Spread to the western hemisphere|HIV instead first came to the United States]] with [[Haiti]]an immigrants around 1969, many years prior to trials conducted on the Hepatitis B vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7068574.stm BBC NEWS | Health | Key HIV strain 'came from Haiti']&lt;/ref&gt;
