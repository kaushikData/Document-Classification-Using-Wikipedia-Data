The '''2008 [[Kosovo]] [[declaration of independence]]''' was adopted on 17 February 2008 by the [[Assembly of Kosovo]].&lt;ref name="ICJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/141/15987.pdf |publisher=[[International Court of Justice]] |title=Accordance with International Law of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence In Respect of Kosovo |accessdate=2012-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rRB9e3bz?url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/141/15987.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-23 |df= |page=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a meeting attended by 109 of the total 120 members,&lt;ref name="ICJ"/&gt; the assembly unanimously declared Kosovo to be independent from [[Serbia]],&lt;ref name="bbc_proclaim"&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7249034.stm Kosovo MPs proclaim independence]", BBC News Online, 17 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; while all 11 representatives of the [[Kosovo Serbs|Serb]] [[minority group|minority]] boycotted the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assembly-kosova.org/common/docs/proc/trans_s_2008_02_17_al.pdf Transkript: Nga Seanca Plenare e Jashtëzakonshme Solemne e Kuvendit Të Kosovës Me Rastin e Shpalljes Së Pavarësisë, Të Mbajtur Më 17 Shkurt 2008], Republic of Kosovo Assembly, 2008-02-17 (in Albanian)&lt;/ref&gt; It was the second declaration of independence by Kosovo's [[Albanian people|Albanian]]-majority political institutions; [[Republic of Kosova|the first was proclaimed]] on 7 September 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Howard Clark| title = Civil Resistance in Kosovo| date = August 2000| publisher = Pluto Press| isbn = 978-0-7453-1569-0| page = 73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legality of the declaration has been disputed. Serbia sought international validation and support for its stance that the declaration was illegal, and in October 2008 requested [[International Court of Justice advisory opinion on Kosovo's declaration of independence|an advisory opinion]] from the [[International Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8004622.stm | work=BBC News | title=Serbian president visits Kosovo | date=2009-04-17 | accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court determined that the declaration did not violate international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/141/16012.pdf?PHPSESSID=b0b24a6135eaf2347d5b0a0badec77ff | title=Press Release: Accordance with international law of the unilateral declaration of independence in respect of Kosovo: Advisory Opinion | date=2010-07-22 | accessdate=2010-08-04 | publisher=International Court of Justice | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807010647/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/141/16012.pdf?PHPSESSID=fd67c1c1a61d2a99cf11356e050236bb | archivedate=7 August 2010 | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the ICJ decision, a joint Serbia-EU resolution was passed in the [[United Nations General Assembly]] which called for an [[Belgrade–Pristina negotiations|EU-facilitated dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia]] to "promote cooperation, achieve progress on the path to the European Union and improve the lives of the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unmikonline.org/Documents/GA64298.pdf|title = UNGA Resolution 64/298|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dialogue resulted in the [[Brussels Agreement (2013)|2013 Brussels deal]] between Serbia and Kosovo which abolished all of the Republic of Serbia's institutions in Kosovo.

{{Main article|History of Kosovo}}

===Background===
The [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija]] took shape in 1945 as the [[Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija (1945–1963)]] within Socialist Yugoslavia, as an autonomous region within [[People's Republic of Serbia]]. Initially a ceremonial entity, more power was devolved to Kosovan authorities with each constitutional reform. In 1968 it became the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]] and in 1974 new constitution enabled the province to function at every administrative level independently of its host republic within Yugoslavia. Increasing ethnic tension throughout Yugoslavia in the late 1980s amid rising nationalism among its nations eventually led to a decentralised state: this facilitated Serbian President [[Slobodan Milošević]] in effectively terminating the privileges awarded to the Kosovar assembly in 1974. The move attracted criticism from the leaderships of the other Yugoslav republics but no higher authority was in place to reverse the measure. In response to the action, the Kosovo Assembly voted on 2 July 1990 to declare Kosovo [[Republic of Kosova|an independent state]], and this received recognition from Albania. A [[state of emergency]] and harsh security rules were subsequently imposed against Kosovo's Albanians following mass protests. The Albanians established a "parallel state" to provide education and social services while boycotting or being excluded from Yugoslav institutions.  
[[File:Kosovo 1913-1992 CIA.jpg|thumb|300px|Kosovo from 1946 to 1992 (Source: CIA)]]

Kosovo remained largely quiet through the [[Yugoslav wars]]. The severity of the Yugoslav government in Kosovo was internationally criticised. In 1996, the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA) began attacking federal security forces. The conflict escalated until Kosovo was on the verge of all-out war by the end of 1998. In January 1999, [[NATO]] warned that it would intervene militarily against Yugoslavia if it did not agree to the introduction of an international peacekeeping force and the establishment of local government in Kosovo. Subsequent peace talks failed and from 24 March to 11 June 1999, NATO carried out [[Kosovo war|an extensive bombing campaign]] against FR Yugoslavia including targets in Kosovo itself. The war ended with Milošević agreeing to allow peacekeepers into Kosovo and withdrawing all security forces so as to transfer governance to the [[United Nations]].

===Build-up===
{{Further|Kosovo (UNMIK)|Constitutional status of Kosovo|Kosovo status process}}
A NATO-led Kosovo Force ([[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]) entered the province following the [[Kosovo War]], tasked with providing security to the UN Mission in Kosovo ([[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]]). Before and during the handover of power, an estimated 100,000 Serbs and other non-Albanians, mostly [[Romani people|Romani]], fled the province for fear of reprisals. In the case of the non-Albanians, the Romani in particular were regarded by many Albanians as having assisted federal forces during the war. Many left along with the withdrawing security forces, expressing fears that they would be targeted by returning Albanian refugees and KLA fighters who blamed them for wartime acts of violence. Thousands more were driven out by intimidation, attacks and a wave of crime after the war.

Large numbers of refugees from Kosovo still live in temporary camps and shelters in Serbia proper. In 2002, Serbia and Montenegro reported hosting 277,000 internally displaced people (the vast majority being Serbs and Roma from Kosovo), which included 201,641 persons displaced from Kosovo into Serbia proper, 29,451 displaced from Kosovo into Montenegro, and about 46,000 displaced within Kosovo itself, including 16,000 returning refugees unable to inhabit their original homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refugees.org/world/countryrpt/europe/yugoslavia.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041029061224/http://www.refugees.org/world/countryrpt/europe/yugoslavia.htm |date=October 29, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.ch/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/statistics/opendoc.pdf?tbl=STATISTICS&amp;id=414ad5b57&amp;page=statistics ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613013001/http://www.unhcr.ch/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/statistics/opendoc.pdf?tbl=STATISTICS&amp;id=414ad5b57&amp;page=statistics |date=June 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some sources put the figure far lower. In 2004 the European Stability Initiative estimated the number of displaced people as being only 65,000, with 130,000 Serbs remaining in Kosovo, though this would leave a significant proportion of the pre-1999 ethnic Serb population unaccounted-for. The largest concentration of ethnic Serbs in Kosovo is in the north of the province above the [[Ibar river]], but an estimated two-thirds (75,000) of the Serbian population in Kosovo continue to live in the Albanian-dominated south of the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esiweb.org/index.php?lang=en&amp;id=156&amp;document_ID=53 |title=The Lausanne Principle: Multiethnicity, Territory and the Future of Kosovo's Serbs |publisher=Esiweb.org |date=7 June 2004 |location=Berlin/Pristina |accessdate=2008-10-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081206110352/http://www.esiweb.org/index.php?lang=en&amp;id=156&amp;document_ID=53| archivedate= 6 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 March 2004, serious [[unrest in Kosovo]] led to 19 deaths, and the destruction of thirty-five Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries in the province, as Albanians started pogroms against the Serbs. Several thousand more Kosovo Serbs have left their homes to seek refuge in Serbia proper or in the Serb-dominated north of Kosovo.

Since the end of the war, Kosovo has been a major source and destination country in the [[trafficking of women]], women forced into prostitution and sexual slavery. The growth in the sex trade industry was fuelled by NATO forces in Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/actforwomen/stories-9-eng |title=Amnesty International &amp;#124; Working to Protect Human Rights |publisher=Web.amnesty.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013123632/http://web.amnesty.org/actforwomen/stories-9-eng |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,1211214,00.html |title=Nato force 'feeds Kosovo sex trade' |publisher=The Guardian |author=Ian Traynor |date=May 7, 2004 |accessdate=2008-10-25 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012143346/http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0%2C%2C1211214%2C00.html |archivedate=October 12, 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refugeesinternational.org/content/article/detail/4146?PHPSESSID=8cd9d5b0df1ae0bbae8d3ddf647ec715 |title=Conflict, Sexual Trafficking, and Peacekeeping |publisher=Refugees International |date=October 8, 2004 |accessdate=2008-10-25 |archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20061121070047/http%3A//www%2Erefugeesinternational%2Eorg/content/article/detail/4146|archivedate = November 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

International negotiations began in 2006 to determine the final status of Kosovo, as envisaged under [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]] which ended the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] of 1999. Serbia's continued sovereignty over Kosovo was recognised internationally. The vast majority of the province's population sought independence.

===Declaration of 2008–present===
[[File:Kosovo 2008.png|thumb|200px|Countries recognizing Kosovo by the end of 2008]]
The 2008 declaration was a product of failed negotiations concerning the adoption of the [[Ahtisaari plan]], which broke down in the fall of 2007. The plan, prepared by the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Special Envoy]] and former [[President of Finland]], [[Martti Ahtisaari]], stipulated a sort of supervised independence for Kosovo, without expressly using the word "independence" among its proposals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/fs/101244.htm|title=Summary of the Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement|website=2001-2009.state.gov|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the plan, Kosovo would gain self-governance under the supervision of the [[European Union]], and become obligated to expressly protect its minorities' rights by means of a [[constitution]] and a representative government.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015082628/http://www.unosek.org/docref/Comprehensive_proposal-english.pdf|title=Letter dated 26 March 2007 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council, Addendum, Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement, Annex IX, International Civilian Representative|last=|first=|date=26 March 2007|website=|archive-url=http://www.unosek.org/docref/Comprehensive_proposal-english.pdf|archive-date=9 October 2009|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kosovo would be accorded its own national symbols such as a flag and a [[coat of arms]], and be obligated to carry out border demarcation on the Kosovo-[[Republic of Macedonia]] border.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Albanian negotiators supported the Ahtisaari plan essentially in whole, and the plan gained the backing of the [[European Union]] and of the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2007/february/79774.htm|title=Presentation of Kosovo Status Proposal to the Parties|last=McCormack|first=Sean|date=2 February 2007|website=2001-2009.state.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Serbia]] and [[Russia]] rejected it outright, and no progress was possible on the [[United Nations]] front.

Faced with no progress on negotiations in sight, the Kosovars decided to unilaterally proclaim the [[Republic of Kosovo]], obligating themselves in the process to follow the Ahtisaari plan's provisions in full.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As of mid-April 2008, this has largely been the case, with the new Republic adopting a constitution written by local and international scholars protecting minority rights and providing for a representative government with guaranteed ethnic representation, which law is to take effect on 15 June 2008. It also adopted some of its national symbols already, including the flag and coat of arms, while work continues on defining the anthem. It has also engaged, albeit with a delay, in the border demarcation talks with [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], initially insisting on being recognised first, but dropping this condition later on.

The 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence elicited mixed reaction internationally and a polarised one domestically, the latter along the division of [[Serbs in Kosovo|Kosovo Serbs]] vs. the [[Albanians in Kosovo|Kosovo Albanians]]. Accordingly, effective control in Kosovo has also fractured along these lines.

After 13 years of international oversight, Kosovo's authorities formally obtained full unsupervised control of the region (less only [[North Kosovo]]) on 10 September 2012 when Western Powers terminated their oversight. The International Steering Group, in its final meeting with the authorities in Pristina, declared that the Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement, known as the Ahtisaari plan after its Finnish UN creator, had been substantially implemented.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/kosovo-supervision-lifted&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, as of November 2015, [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] still functions, albeit at a greatly reduced capacity.

==Political background==
{{Main article|Kosovo status process}}
[[File:Kosovo ethnic 2005.png|right|thumb|Ethnic composition of Kosovo as of 2005]]

After the end of the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999, the [[United Nations Security Council]] adopted [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244|Resolution 1244]] to provide a framework for Kosovo's interim status. It placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration, demanded a withdrawal of Serbian security forces from Kosovo and envisioned an eventual UN-facilitated political process to resolve the status of Kosovo.

In February 2007, [[Martti Ahtisaari]] delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in [[Belgrade]] and [[Pristina]], the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposed 'supervised independence' for the province. By early July 2007 a draft resolution, backed by the [[United States]] and the [[European Union]] members of the [[Security Council]], had been rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty. However, it had still not found agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07|title=Russia reportedly rejects fourth draft resolution on Kosovo status|publisher=SETimes.com| accessdate= 9 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|five permanent members]], stated that it would not support any resolution which was not acceptable to both Serbia and the Kosovo Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/07/10/nb-02|title=UN Security Council remains divided on Kosovo|publisher=SETimes.com| accessdate= 9 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most observers had, at the beginning of the talks, anticipated independence as the most likely outcome, others suggested that a rapid resolution might not be preferable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/985caa90-de5a-11db-afa7-000b5df10621.html|title=A long reconciliation process is required|publisher=Financial Times| accessdate= 9 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The talks finally broke down, late 2007 with the two sides remaining far apart, with the minimum demands of each side being more than the other was willing to accept.

At the turn of 2008, the media started reporting that the Kosovo Albanians were determined to proclaim independence. This came at the time when the ten-year anniversary of the Kosovo War was looming (with the five-year anniversary being marked by [[2004 unrest in Kosovo|violent unrest]]); the U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] was in his last year in power and not able to seek re-election; and two nations which had previously seceded from Yugoslavia were in important political positions (Slovenia [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|presiding over the EU]] and Croatia an elected member of the [[UN Security Council]]). The proclamation was widely reported to have been postponed until after the [[Serbian presidential election, 2008]], held on 20 January and 3 February, given that Kosovo was an important topic of the election campaign.

==Adoption and terms of the declaration of independence==
''"We, the democratically elected leaders of our people, hereby declare Kosovo to be an independent and sovereign state. This declaration reflects the will of our people and it is in full accordance with the recommendations of UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari and his Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement. We declare Kosovo to be a democratic, secular and multi-ethnic republic, guided by the principles of non-discrimination and equal protection under the law."''

The declaration of independence was made by members of the [[Kosovo Assembly]] as well as by the [[President of Kosovo]] meeting in [[Pristina]], the capital of Kosovo, on 17 February 2008. It was approved by a unanimous quorum, numbering 109 members. Eleven deputies representing Serbian national minority boycotted the proceedings. All nine other ethnic minority representatives were part of the [[quorum]].&lt;ref name="transcript of the vote - not just a show of hands, but a written record who voted and who was absent"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.assembly-kosova.org/common/docs/proc/trans_s_2008_02_17_al.pdf |format=PDF| title=Transcript: NGA SEANCA PLENARE E JASHTËZAKONSHME SOLEMNE E KUVENDIT TË KOSOVËS ME RASTIN E SHPALLJES SË PAVARËSISË, TË MBAJTUR MË 17 SHKURT 2008 | publisher=Republika e Kosovës Kuvendi – Republika Kosova Skupština – Republic of Kosovo Assembly | work=Legjislatura III | location=[[Pristina]] | language=Albanian | date=2008-02-17 | accessdate=2008-10-12 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The terms of the declaration state that Kosovo's independence is limited to the principles outlined by the [[Ahtisaari plan]]. It prohibits Kosovo from joining any other country, provides for only a limited military capability, states that Kosovo will be under international supervision and provides for the protection of minority ethnic communities.&lt;ref name="bbc_proclaim" /&gt;

===Legality of the declaration===
[[File:Kosovo stamp annulled by Serbia.jpg|thumb|Kosovo passport stamps cancelled by Serbian passport control police to demonstrate its non-recognition of Kosovo's secession.]]

On 18 February 2008 the [[National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia]] declared Kosovo's declaration of independence as null and void per the suggestion of the [[Government of the Republic of Serbia]], after the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Serbia deemed the act illegal arguing it was not in coordination with the UN Charter, the Constitution of Serbia, the Helsinki Final Act, [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]] (including the previous resolutions) and the Badinter Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlament.gov.rs/content/cir/akta/akta_detalji.asp?Id=367&amp;t=O Decision of the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia regarding the Confirmation of the Decision of the Government of the Republic of Serbia regarding the Abolition of Illegal Acts of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government in Kosovo and Metohia in regards to the unilateral Declaration of Independence]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128220902/http://www.parlament.gov.rs/content/cir/akta/akta_detalji.asp?Id=367&amp;t=O |date=November 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to writer [[Noel Malcolm]], the 1903 constitution was still in force at the time that Serbia annexed Kosovo&lt;ref&gt;World and Its Peoples, Marshall Cavendish, 2010, p 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balkan Worlds, Traian Stoianovich, M.E. Sharpe, Sep 1, 1994, p 303,304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Central and South-Eastern Europe 2004, Europa Publications Psychology Press, 2003 - Political Science&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[First Balkan War]]. He elaborates that this constitution required a Grand National Assembly before Serbia's borders could be expanded to include Kosovo; but no such Grand National Assembly was ever held. Constitutionally, he argues, Kosovo should not have become part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. It was initially ruled by decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malcolm|first=Noel|title=Kosovo: A Short History|year=1999|publisher=Harper Perennial|isbn=978-0-06-097775-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perić, ''La question constitutionelle en Serbie'', Paris 1914&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2013}}

===Precedent or special case===
{{Main article|Kosovo independence precedent}}
Recognition of Kosovo's independence is controversial. A number of countries fear that it is a precedent, affecting other contested territories in Europe and non-European parts of the former Soviet Union, such as [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]].&lt;ref name="catofeb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Friedman|first=George| title = Kosovar Independence and the Russian Reaction|publisher = [[Stratfor]]|date = 20 February 2008|url = http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/kosovar_independence_and_russian_reaction|accessdate = 2008-09-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100307044349/http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/kosovar_independence_and_russian_reaction| archivedate=March 7, 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text of Kosovo's declaration of independence addressed this issue by stating "...Observing that Kosovo is a special case arising from Yugoslavia's non-consensual breakup and is not a precedent for any other situation, Recalling the years of strife and violence in Kosovo, that disturbed the conscience of "all civilized people"..." However, Ted Galen Carpenter of the [[Cato Institute]] stated the view of Kosovo being ''[[sui generis]]'' and setting no precedent is "extraordinarily naïve".&lt;ref name="catofeb"&gt;{{cite web|last=Galen Carpenter |first=Ted |title=Kosovo Independence Grenade |publisher=[[Cato Institute]] |date=22 February 2008 |url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=9238 |accessdate=2008-09-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910045818/http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=9238 |archivedate=10 September 2008 |deadurl=bot: unknown |df= }} Archived by [[WebCite]] at .&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February, there were [[Kosovo is Serbia protest|large demonstrations by Serbs in Belgrade]]. There were more than 500,000 protesters.

A group broke into The United States embassy, set it on fire, and attempted to throw furniture through the windows. The embassy was empty, except for security personnel.

US ambassador to the UN [[Zalmay Khalilzad]] was "outraged", and requested the UN Security Council immediately issue a statement "expressing the council's outrage, condemning the attack, and also reminding the Serb government of its responsibility to protect diplomatic facilities."

The Turkish and British embassies were also attacked, but police were able to prevent damage. The interior of a McDonald's was damaged. A local clinic admitted 30 injured, half of whom were police; most wounds were minor.&lt;ref name="yahoo 2/21" /&gt;

The Security Council responded to these incidents by issuing a unanimous statement that, "The members of the Security Council condemn in the strongest terms the mob attacks against embassies in Belgrade, which have resulted in damage to embassy premises and have endangered diplomatic personnel," noting that the [[1961 Vienna Convention]] requires host states to protect embassies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN21520115|title=U.N. council condemns Belgrade embassy attacks|publisher=Reuters|date=2008-02-21|accessdate=2008-02-21 | first=Patrick | last=Worsnip| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080225200937/https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN21520115| archivedate= 25 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of [[Bosnian Serb]] demonstrators broke away from a peaceful rally in [[Banja Luka]] on 26 February 2008 and headed for the [[United States]] Embassy's office there, clashing with police along the way.&lt;ref name=croatia-arrests /&gt;

In Montenegro, protests were held in [[Podgorica]] on 19 February. Protesters waved flags of the [[Serb People's Party (Montenegro)|Serb People's Party]] and the [[Serbian Radical Party]]. Serb parties led by the [[Serb List (2006)|Serb List]] are calling for a protest on 22 February to protest the independence bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = BalkanInsight.com – Montenegro Students Protest | url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/8022/ | accessdate = 2008-02-22 | year = 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080226052543/http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/8022/  |archivedate = 2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International reaction===
{{Main article|International recognition of Kosovo}}
Unlike the [[1990 Kosovo declaration of independence]], which only [[Albania]] recognised,&lt;ref&gt;Clark (2000), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Kosovo's second declaration of independence has been recognised by {{Numrec|Kos||UN member states}} and the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]). However many states have also showed their opposition to Kosovo's declaration of independence, most notably [[China]] and [[Russia]]. Serbia announced before the declaration that it would withdraw its ambassador from any state which recognised independent Kosovo.&lt;ref name="SMH190208"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/serbia-tipped-to-recall-ambassador/20080219-1svc.html |title=Serbia tipped to recall ambassador |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |first=Sandra |last=O'malley |date=2008-02-19 |accessdate=9 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429173028/http://news.smh.com.au/serbia-tipped-to-recall-ambassador/20080219-1svc.html |archivedate=29 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Serbia, however, maintains embassies in many countries which recognise Kosovo, including Albania, Canada, Croatia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, Turkey, the UAE, the UK, and the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.rs/sr/index.php/diplomatsko-konzularna-predstavnistva/diplomatske-misije/ambasade?lang=lat|title=Ambasade Republike Srbije|trans-title=Embassies of the Republic of Serbia|publisher=Republic of Serbia, Ministry of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reaction within the European Union====
[[United Nations|UN]].[[File:Kosova independence Vienna 17-02-2008 b.jpg|thumb|200px|Celebration of the declaration of independence of Kosovo in [[Vienna]], Austria]]
On 18 February 2008 the EU presidency announced after a day of intense talks between foreign ministers that member countries were free to decide individually whether to recognise Kosovo's independence. The majority of EU member states have recognised Kosovo, but Cyprus, Greece, Romania, Slovakia and Spain have not.&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite news | title=EU splits on Kosovo recognition | date=2008-02-18 | publisher=BBC news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7249909.stm | accessdate = 2008-02-19 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080219222716/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7249909.stm| archivedate= 19 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Spanish people (scholars or from the Spanish Government or opposition parties) challenged the comparison made by the Basque Government that way of Kosovo's independence could be a path for the [[Basque nationalism|independence of the Basque Country]] and [[Catalan independence|Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/772560/l/catalunya/kosovo/independencia/ International Law Teacher from Catalonia argues that Catalonia or Basque Country and Kosovo cases are different.] (22/07)&lt;br&gt;[http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/772875/0/moratinos/independencia/kosovo/ Spanish Foreign Minister says Spain will not recognize Kosovo's independence, not even mentioning comparison to Basque Country or Catalonia] (23/07)&lt;br&gt;[http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/773759/0/ Basque Country politician (EB) states Court decision forces Spanish Government to recognize autodetemination rights] (23/07)&lt;br&gt;Previously in 2008: [http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/349987/0/azkarate/ibarretxe/kosovo/ Basque Government spokeswoman says Kosovo is an example to be followed] (17/022008)&lt;br&gt;[http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/350490/0/llamazares/kosovo/independencia/ Spanish opposition politician denies that cases can be compared] (18/02/2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before Kosovo's declaration of independence, the [[European Union]] approved deployment of a non-military 2,000-member Rule of Law mission, "[[EULEX]]," to develop further Kosovo's police and justice sector. All twenty-seven members of the EU approved the EULEX mandate, including the minority of EU countries that have still not recognised Kosovo's independence. Serbia has claimed that this is an occupation and that the EU's move is illegal.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;

====Outside the EU====

[[United States]] president [[George W. Bush]] welcomed the declaration of independence as well as its proclamation of friendship with Serbia, stating: "We have strongly supported the [[Ahtisaari plan]] [implying Kosovo's independence …]. We are heartened by the fact that the Kosovo government has clearly proclaimed its willingness and its desire to support Serbian rights in Kosovo. We also believe it's in Serbia's interests to be aligned with Europe and the Serbian people can know that they have a friend in America.”&lt;ref name="BBC reaction"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7249586.stm In quotes: Kosovo reaction], BBC News Online, 17 February 2008; https://web.archive.org/web/20080306100251/http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/02/20080217.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russia]] reacted with condemnation, stating they "expect the UN mission and NATO-led forces in Kosovo to take immediate action to carry out their mandate [...] including the annulling of the decisions of Pristina's self-governing organs and the taking of tough administrative measures against them.”&lt;ref name="BBC reaction" /&gt;

In [[Tirana]], the capital of [[Albania]], 'Kosovo Day' was held as a celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=02&amp;dd=17&amp;nav_id=47778 |title=Tirana celebrates "Kosovo Day" |publisher=[[B92]] |accessdate=9 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219170555/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=02&amp;dd=17&amp;nav_id=47778 |archivedate=19 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turkey|Turkish]] [[Prime Minister of Turkey|Prime Minister]] [[Tayyip Erdoğan]] phoned [[Prime Minister of Kosovo]] [[Hashim Thaçi]] saying the declaration of independence "will bring to [[Balkans]] peace and stability”.&lt;ref name="zaman"&gt;[http://www.zaman.com.tr/haber.do?haberno=653542 Ankara'dan Kosova'ya jest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525070103/http://www.zaman.com.tr/haber.do?haberno=653542 |date=2008-05-25 }}, Zaman Newspaper, 18 February 2008 (in [[Turkish language]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Taiwan|Republic of China]]'s (commonly known as Taiwan; non-UN member) Foreign Ministry stated "We congratulate the Kosovo people on their winning independence and hope they enjoy the fruits of democracy and freedom. [...] Democracy and self-determination are the rights endorsed by the United Nations.

{{Main article|International Court of Justice advisory opinion on Kosovo's declaration of independence}}
On July 22, 2010 the International Court of Justice [[International Court of Justice advisory opinion on Kosovo's declaration of independence#Opinion issued|ruled that]] the declaration did not violate international law, holding that the authors were acting in their capacity as representatives of the people of Kosovo outside the framework of the interim administration (the [[Assembly of Kosovo]] and the [[Provisional Institutions of Self-Government]]), and were therefore not bound by the [[Constitutional Framework for the Provisional Self-Government of Kosovo|Constitutional Framework]] (promulgated by [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]]) or by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UNSCR1244]] that is addressed only to [[United Nations Member States]] and [[Organs of United Nations|organs of the United Nations]].&lt;ref name="ICJ"/&gt; Prior to the announcement Hashim Thaçi said there would be no "winners or losers" and that "I expect this to be a correct decision, according to the will of Kosovo's citizens. Kosovo will respect the advisory opinion." For his part, Boris Tadić, the Serbian president, warned that "If the International Court of Justice sets a new principle, it would trigger a process that would create several new countries and destabilise numerous regions in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/07/201072232633925457.html |title=ICJ rules on Kosovo statehood - Europe |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2010-07-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100723170527/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/07/201072232633925457.html| archivedate= 23 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ANSWER has faced [[A.N.S.W.E.R.#Relationships within the anti-war movement|criticism from other anti-war groups]] for its affiliations, tactics at demonstrations, and allegedly sectarian approach to joint anti-war work. It also faced [[A.N.S.W.E.R.#Antisemitism and Anti-Zionism|criticism from various sources]] for its claimed [[anti-Zionist]] politics.

Though its national headquarters are in [[Washington, D.C.]], where it organizes its national antiwar demonstrations, the coalition's influence is seen as being strongest in [[The Castro]], [[San Francisco]], and increasingly, in [[Los Angeles]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

== Major protest actions ==
=== 2001–02 ===
ANSWER's first major action was a September 29, 2001, "Anti-War, Anti-Racist" [[Demonstration (people)|political rally]] and march in [[Washington, D.C.]], primarily in protest of the impending [[U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]]. An estimated 8,000 people participated.

ANSWER's next major demonstration took place on April 20, 2002, which according to ANSWER's website, drew 100,000 people to Washington in the largest pro-[[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] demonstration in [[U.S. history]]. On October 26 of that year, ANSWER held a demonstration against Congress' vote to authorize the use of force against [[Iraq]], which according to its website drew 100,000 in San Francisco and 200,000 in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="ANSWER: About us"&gt;According to police and the media, the numbers were about a tenth as many. Extreme left groups are notorious for grossly inflating the numbers in attendance at their rallies.

=== 2003–04 ===
ANSWER called antiwar demonstrations on January 18, 2003, in Washington, D.C., and [[San Francisco]], which were each attended by 200,000 people, according to the group's website. ANSWER was one of several groups organizing the U.S. component of the worldwide [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest]], which was, across the globe, the largest anti-war rally that has ever taken place.&lt;ref name="Guinness Book of Records"/&gt; ANSWER sponsored emergency demonstrations just before the launch of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, on March 15, 2003, which according to its website drew 100,000 people each in San Francisco and Washington. With [[United for Peace and Justice]] (UFPJ), it cosponsored an anti-occupation protest in Washington on October 25 of that year which, again according to the group's website, brought out 100,000 people in Washington.&lt;ref name="ANSWER: About us"/&gt;

ANSWER called for national [[anti-war]], pro-[[Palestinian people|Palestinian]], and anti-[[2004 Haiti rebellion|Haitian coup]] demonstrations on March 20, 2004, (the first anniversary of the invasion of Iraq.) The protest in New York, cosponsored by UFPJ, was attended by 100,000 according to the ANSWER website. ANSWER participated in the [[March for Women's Lives]] on April 25, and the protests of the [[2004 Republican National Convention]] from August 30 to September 2.&lt;ref name="ANSWER: About us"/&gt;

=== 2005–06 ===
ANSWER and UFPJ jointly sponsored a [[September 24, 2005 anti-war protest|rally in Washington, D.C. on September 24, 2005]], with attendance estimated by police at 150,000 and by organizers at 300,000 people.&lt;ref name="2005-09-24 protest"/&gt;

ANSWER was involved with [[2006 United States immigration reform protests|demonstrations]] on [[May Day]], 2006, in support of rights for undocumented immigrants, which brought out several million people across the U.S. These protests were organized by a number of groups unrelated to ANSWER as well.&lt;ref name="The Dallas Morning News on May Day 2006"&gt;

In late June 2006, ANSWER organized and participated in local rallies against the Israeli invasion of Gaza. Shortly after Israel invaded Lebanon two weeks later, ANSWER — along with the National Council of Arab Americans and the [[Muslim American Society]] — initiated a call for protests on August 12, 2006, against the "U.S.-Israeli War on the People of Lebanon and Palestine." Organizers estimated that the August 12 demonstrations drew 30,000 protesters in Washington, 10,000 in San Francisco, and 5,000 in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;

=== 2007 and later ===
[[File:ANSWER March on the Pentagon.jpg|thumb|250px|Marching during the [[March 17, 2007 anti-war protest]] in Washington, D.C.]]
ANSWER called national antiwar demonstrations in San Francisco and Washington, DC for September 15, 2007.  According to the group, the attendance was 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;

ANSWER joined with other groups to organize the [[March 20, 2010 anti-war protest]] in Washington, DC.

=== Attendance figures ===
ANSWER figures for the size of its March, 2007, protest were higher than corresponding ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' figures.  ANSWER engaged in a public dispute with the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' about the size of that demonstration.  ANSWER Western Regional Coordinator Richard Becker wrote in an op-ed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;WHILE TENS of thousands of spirited anti-war marchers were still entering the San Francisco Civic Center on Sunday, March 18... organizers got word that a Chronicle reporter covering the event had already determined that only 3,000 people were present... Mainstream media undercounting of progressive demonstrations is nothing new, but this one had a magician's touch.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Analyzing the width and pace of the march together with the time required for the march to pass a certain point, Becker argues that the Chronicle's estimate is "impossible."&lt;ref&gt;

Some on the left have also accused ANSWER of exaggerating protest attendance.  An October 2007 ''[[Socialist Worker]]'' editorial penned by [[Todd Chretien]] and republished on ''[[CounterPunch]]'' asserted: "Ask anyone who has worked with ANSWER, and they will tell you that its organizers always double the number of people at their marches. More recently, the multiplication factor has increased." Chretien describes this as "disorienting for the movement."&lt;ref&gt;

==Member organizations==
{{Expand section|date=August 2017}}
Many of ANSWER's lead organizers had ties to the [[International Action Center]] and the [[Workers World Party]] (WWP) at the time of ANSWER's founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.centredaily.com/mld/centredaily/news/4964945.htm|title=As big anti-war protests loom, some political rifts surface|first=Dana|last=Hull|publisher=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=2003-01-16|accessdate=2008-02-22|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040223175840/http://www.centredaily.com/mld/centredaily/news/4964945.htm|archivedate=February 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
=== Relationships within the anti-war movement ===
Few other prominent antiwar groups in the U.S. or elsewhere have formal relationships with ANSWER, although many have participated in the major ANSWER-sponsored protests.

There has been much discussion among U.S. [[Left-wing politics#Leftism, Pacifism and "War on Terror"|leftist opponents]] of the Iraq and Afghanistan invasions of the degree to which they are or are not willing to work with ANSWER because of its affiliations.&lt;ref name="Albert and Shalom"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

|publisher=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]
|date=2002-11-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Albert]] and [[Stephen R. Shalom]] writing in ''[[Z magazine]]'' argue that regardless of the political views of some speakers at a major antiwar demonstration, "as long as other speakers can and do express positions with a different point of view, the overall impact of the event will still be positive, particularly in the absence of other options. Most of the people at the demonstration will in fact be unaware of exactly who said what and whether any particular speaker omitted this or that point. What they will experience will be a powerful antiwar protest. And most of the public will see it that way too."&lt;ref name="Albert and Shalom"/&gt;

==== Break with UFPJ ====
Although ANSWER worked with [[United for Peace and Justice]] (UFPJ) to build the September 24, 2005, Washington, D.C. rally, a December 2005 statement by the UFPJ Steering Committee says that UFPJ "has decided not to coordinate work with ANSWER again on a national level. The document cites three reasons for the decision:
# ANSWER did not honor the agreed-upon time limits for its sections of the pre-march Rally...
# ANSWER delayed the start of the March... and
# ANSWER did not turn out many volunteers."

The document says that the UFPJ Steering Committee "did not have consensus" about the decision not to work with ANSWER, but had "a more than two thirds supermajority ... We make no recommendations or mandates on this issue to UFPJ member groups in local or constituency-based area..."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

 |deadurl=yes 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ANSWER responded by saying that "UFPJ has publicly proclaimed its intention to split the movement," and accused UFPJ of "a false and ugly attack on the ANSWER Coalition," and of doing so for "embarrassingly petty and astonishingly trivial" reasons. Besides giving their own version of the events surrounding September 24, ANSWER's statement indicates some less trivial differences between the groups: they criticize UFPJ for its willingness to support the ideas of mainstream politicians, such as [[John Murtha]], who are disaffected with the war, while ANSWER "considers it harmful to try to tailor the message of the progressive movement to please the long-awaited but fictional support from the politicians." ANSWER asks, "Why is it that UFPJ's leadership can build a gushing "united front" with imperialist politicians but not the ANSWER Coalition, which has organized hundreds of thousands of people to promote genuine peace and self-determination?"&lt;ref name="ANSWER Responds to UFPJ"&gt;

|date=2005-12-16
|accessdate=2006-01-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At considerable length, ANSWER argued that the current split has historical roots, dating back to "the first Iraq war of 1990–1991, [when] some of the same leadership forces now in UFPJ chose to create a second antiwar coalition and insisted on marching under the banner "[[economic sanctions|Economic Sanctions]] Not War" while some of those who are today in the leadership of ANSWER argued that economic sanctions were war — and a weapon of mass destruction at that. We contended that economic sanctions against Iraq would result in a form of genocide against the Iraqi people and that the only correct position for the U.S. antiwar movement was to demand, 'No war against Iraq.'… The economic sanctions ultimately took the lives of more than one million Iraqis, most of them children under the age of five, according to the UN's own statistics… The question for the antiwar movement is this: are we building a movement that comprehensively challenges imperialism or are we opposed only to certain tactics employed by imperialism such as overt, unilateral military invasion?"&lt;ref name="ANSWER Responds to UFPJ"/&gt;

Regarding the prospects of working again with UFPJ, ANSWER wrote, "[we regard] the united front that was formed at [our] initiative to have been remarkably successful," and later, "Different groups may have different slogans on their banners, but they should try to overcome the forces of division so as to march shoulder to shoulder against the real enemy."&lt;ref name="ANSWER Responds to UFPJ"/&gt;

Although the language of the UFPJ Steering Committee statement makes the break appear definitive, they have published similar statements (rejecting future work with ANSWER) in the past, only to later agree to united demonstrations. A May 2005 decision to the same effect — announcing a September 24 demonstration separate from the one initiated by ANSWER&lt;ref&gt;

=== Anti-Zionism and Allegations of Anti-Semitism ===

The May–June 2003 issue of ''[[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]]'' magazine, a progressive magazine of Jewish interests, contained a special section entitled ''Authoritarianism and Anti-Semitism in the Anti-War Movement?''  According to ''Tikkun'', "many Jews report that they were encountering what they perceived to be anti-Semitism at anti-war demonstrations organized by International A.N.S.W.E.R." ''Tikkun'' described the perceptions of anti-Semitism as based on Israel being singled out for criticism and ANSWER's failure to "acknowledge or support the right of the Jewish people to national self-determination."&lt;ref name="Tikkun on antisemitism"&gt;

According to ANSWER, "We strongly abhor all forms of racism and bigotry, including anti-Semitism.

=== Immigration and May Day 2006 ===
In addition to anti-war activism, ANSWER is involved in advocacy for rights for [[undocumented immigration|undocumented immigrants]], believing that all immigration should be legal. ANSWER became involved in immigrant rights activism through protests against [[Save Our State]], a [[California]]-based anti-undocumented immigration protest group, and the [[Minutemen Project]], a group which patrols the U.S.-[[Mexico]] border to prevent illegal border crossings, and which ANSWER views as practicing racist [[vigilantism]]. These protests began soon after the founding of the Minutemen group in April 2005. ANSWER has not usually been the primary organizer of these protests but has actively supported them. For example, ANSWER helped organize counter-protests of rallies held by right-wing groups in [[Alhambra, California]] on June 21, 2005;&lt;ref&gt;

ANSWER has also been involved in the much larger [[2006 U.S. immigration reform protests|demonstrations]] in opposition to the [[Sensenbrenner Bill]] and support of legalization for undocumented immigrants that have occurred across the United States since March 2006. ANSWER was not the primary organizer of the initial large protests in [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Dallas]] in late March and early April, but endorsed them. ANSWER was more prominent in the promotion of a [[May Day]] "[[Great American Boycott|Day Without An Immigrant]]" strike and boycott, because this call was controversial within the immigrant rights movement, contributing to a growing division between its left-wing advocates and moderates who believed a strike and boycott would be counterproductive.&lt;ref&gt;

ANSWER's position on the left side of this issue led to criticism; Jaime Contreras, president of the National Capital Immigrant Coalition and chairman of the local [[Service Employees International Union]] in Washington, D.C., told the ''[[Washington Post]]'' regarding ANSWER that, "Groups... that have done nothing on immigration have no reason to stick their nose where it doesn't belong... They have no business saying, 'Let's do a strike' when it will create a humongous burden on immigrant groups. They need to stay in their box." Brian Becker, ANSWER's national coordinator, responded that ANSWER has in fact been involved in immigration in the long term, and that "We are just part of the coalition; we are not spearheading it at all... Whatever the immigrant rights community calls for is what we support."&lt;ref&gt;

=== Conflict with DC city government over posters ===
In August 2007, the [[District of Columbia Department of Public Works|DC Department of Public Works]] claimed that ANSWER broke city ordinances by putting signs, advertising a September 15 antiwar march, on utility boxes and using an adhesive that is difficult to remove.  Additionally, the National Park Service, which administers many of the parks in the District of Columbia, claimed that the signs were defacement of federal property and ordered the group to remove the signs or pay for their removal.  ANSWER refused to remove the signs, stating that the adhesive used was legal, water-soluble paste and the city's actions were "politically motivated."  The group said any fines would be without legal basis, and they would appeal if fines were imposed.&lt;ref name="Fines"&gt;{{cite news

An ANSWER spokeswoman stated that they gained support from the publicity and intended to continue to post more posters, stickers, and banners despite the efforts of the city.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

'''''A Field Guide to Australian Birds''''' is a two-volume [[bird]] [[field guide]] published by Rigby of [[Adelaide, South Australia]], in its Rigby Field Guide series.  The first volume (Volume One: Non-Passerines) was issued in 1970, with the second volume (Volume Two: Passerines) appearing in 1974.  It was Australia’s first new national bird field guide since the 1931  publication of the first edition of [[Neville William Cayley|Neville Cayley]]’s ''[[What Bird is That?]]''.  It was principally authored by Australian [[ornithology|ornithologist]], artist and photographer [[Peter Slater (ornithologist)|Peter Slater]].

==Description==
The two volumes are 190&amp;nbsp;mm high by 130&amp;nbsp;mm wide.  With Volume One, Slater had collaborators who contributed much of the text, while he contributed the text on the [[Falconiformes]] and all 64 plates illustrating the bird species.  His collaborators were John Calaby, Graeme Chapman, [[Joseph Forshaw]], [[Harold James Frith|Harold Frith]], Peter Fullagar, [[Gerard Frederick van Tets|Gerry van Tets]] and Eric Lindgren.  Volume Two was essentially all his own work.   Individual maps indicate the Australian range of each species.&lt;ref&gt;Slater (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slater (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume One was reviewed in the ''[[Emu (journal)|Emu]]'' by [[Arnold Robert McGill|Arnold McGill]] (as A.R. McG.):
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Except for Cayley’s ''What Bird is That?'' there has been no readily available publication in which all Australian species are illustrated.  Mr P. Slater is now filling a great need.  The first part of his work is available and the second will, it is understood, soon be completed.  ''A Field Guide to Australian Birds'' has a much wider scope than Cayley’s book.  Apart from the continent and [[Tasmania]] it covers the political dependencies [[Norfolk Island|Norfolk]], [[Lord Howe Island|Lord Howe]], [[Macquarie Island|Macquarie]], [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands|Heard]], [[Christmas Island|Christmas]] and [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Cocos-Keeling Islands]].  This is commendable; for, often these outposts of the Commonwealth have been sadly neglected ornithologically and for the first time a fully illustrated guide is available, reasonably priced, covering the whole area except the New Guinea region.  It is therefore interesting to see included in an Australian book such species as the [[Ruddy Crake]] (Christmas Island), [[Lord Howe Woodhen|Woodhen]] (Lord Howe), [[Weka]] (Macquarie) and even a new family ([[Sheathbill]]s), which occurs on Heard Island."&lt;ref name="armcg"&gt;A.R. McG. (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The illustrations throughout are ample and appear well-executed.  Of special significance are the outlines of bills of the [[Procellariiformes]], drawn to actual size, thus providing for a direct check with any specimen examined in the hand or found as a beach derelict.  Patterns of flight, especially of [[seabird]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[tern]]s and [[wader]]s, are also depicted carefully.  Allowing for difficulties in reproducing exact colour, the appearance and shades of species are most pleasing.  The size of bill of the [[Red-necked Stint]] (p.279) is far too long, but care in such matters is widely apparent.  Because there might be some confusion in identifying [[swallow]]s and [[swift]]s, the former family has been added after the [[Coraciidae]].  The second part of this publication will be as eagerly awaited as was the first.  The whole will be a notable contribution to the ornithology of Australia and a very helpful guide to every field-worker."&lt;ref name="armcg"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McGill also reviewed Volume Two when it was published:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is five years since the first volume of this work dealing with the non-passerines became available and most people with ornithological interests in Australia and many overseas possess a copy.  Therefore the appearance of this volume on passerines has been eagerly awaited.  It completes the work, which many will no doubt compare with Cayley’s long-standing best-seller, ''What Bird is That?''  However, because of different style in the illustrations, the gap between them of over forty years and particularly the different order of presentation of species fair comparison is difficult.  Slater’s work bears closer affinity with Macdonald’s ''Birds of Australia'' (1973), although the latter is more of a handbook than a field guide."&lt;ref name="armcg75"&gt;A.R. McG. (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"My copy of this guide to Australian passerines (which has noticeably fewer pages and is more strongly bound than the non-passerine volume) will remain a valued possession and I will often wish to consult it.  Instead of endeavouring to weigh its merits against some predecessors, I know that it contains data not available in ''What Bird is That?'' and ''Birds of Australia''.  It will take its place beside those two books and its non-passerine partner as a worthy addition to my library."&lt;ref name="armcg75"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No revised and updated edition of the guide was ever issued.  However, in 1986 Slater produced, in collaboration with other members of his family, the completely new, one-volume ''[[The Slater Field Guide to Australian Birds|Slater Field Guide to Australian Birds]]''.

The '''Amos Bull House''' is a historic house at 59 South Prospect Street in [[Hartford, Connecticut]].  Built about 1788, it is one of only a few surviving 18th-century buildings in the city.  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;  It presently houses the main offices of [[Connecticut Landmarks]], a historic preservation organization.

==Description and history==
The Amos Bull House stands just south of the Pulaski Mall, south of [[Downtown Hartford]], on the west side of South Prospect Street.  This is not the house's original location, which was a short way west on Main Street; it has been moved twice.  It is a 2-1/2 story brick building with a gambrel roof.  It is three bays wide, with the main entrance in the leftmost bay.  Openings on the front facade are rectangular, and topped by splayed brownstone lintels.  The front cornice is adorned with dentil moulding, a detail repeated in gabled dormers projecting from the roof.  On the exposed side elevation there is a small sash window in a peaked-gable opening in the gable area, with a smaller half-round window above it just below the roof ridge.  The interior only retains a few traces of its 18th-century origin.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|68000039}}|title=NRHP nomination for Amos Bull House|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house's exact construction date is unknown.  It was standing by 1791, when Amos Bull advertised his dry goods business from its address.  Since he sold it in 1820, it has housed a variety of commercial enterprises.  Originally located facing Main Street, it was moved back from the sidewalk in the early 20th century,&lt;ref name=NRHP/&gt; and was later moved across the block to its present location.

'''Mario Louis Fornini, Sr.''' (April 21, 1914 – September 20, 2013) was an American [[professional wrestler]] and wrestling promoter, better  known professionally as '''Angelo Savoldi'''. At the time of his death, he was known as the world's oldest retired wrestler at the age of 99.&lt;ref name="PWTdeath"/&gt;

==Early life==
Fornini was born in [[Castrocielo]], [[Italy]] in 1914.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; At the age of five, he and his family moved to the [[United States]], where they lived in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2013/09/24/21146561.html|title=Angelo Savoldi: Wrestler, promoter, agent, gentleman|date=September 24, 2013|last=Oliver|first=Greg|accessdate=September 27, 2013|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Fornini was reportedly friends with [[Frank Sinatra]].&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; He first began to wrestle at [[Demarest High School]], but left during the [[Great Depression]] to get a job cutting metal at the Cleveland Container.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==
Fornini's brother [[Lou Fornini|Lou]] was a [[professional wrestler]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], and so Fornini approached New York promoter [[Jack Pfefer]]. Pfefer christened him "Angelo Savoldi", and, billed as the brother of [[Joe Savoldi]], he began wrestling in 1937.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; By 1938, Savoldi was regularly wrestling throughout the Northeastern United States.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; During [[World War II]], Fornini joined the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; He later worked in [[Puerto Rico]], becoming the first American to main event in that region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parsippanymonthly.com/angelo_savoldi.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927115625/http://parsippanymonthly.com/angelo_savoldi.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-09-27|title=Life in the Ring|work=Parsippany Monthly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in the 1950s that Savoldi became a star in the [[Oklahoma]] region, as a junior heavyweight (a term for lightweight). Wrestling as a [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] (villainous character), he held the [[NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship]] three times between 1958 and 1964.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; In Oklahoma, Savoldi [[feud (professional wrestling)|feuded]] with [[Danny Hodge]]. On May 27, 1960, Savoldi and Hodge were facing off in a match, when Savoldi was stabbed with a [[pen knife]] by an angry fan that turned out to be Hodge's father.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;

Savoldi finished his in-ring career with the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (now World Wrestling Entertainment) putting over the promotion's [[face (professional wrestling)|faces]]. He was also a trainer of younger wrestlers,&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia09"/&gt; with [[Jack Brisco]] and [[Ruben Cruz|Hercules Ayala Cortez]] among them. In the 1970s Savoldi was a minority business partner in the WWWF.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia09"/&gt;

In 1984 Angelo, with his sons Mario, Tom and [[Joseph Savoldi]], established [[International World Class Championship Wrestling|International Championship Wrestling]] (ICW) in the Northeastern region.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; Joseph was a featured wrestler for the promotion. Angelo received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Cauliflower Alley Club in 2003, and was inducted into the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] in 2004.

==Personal life==
Fornini and his wife were married for 74 years, and had four sons.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; They lived in [[Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey|Parsippany]], [[New Jersey]], where Fornini owned a record shop with his son Mario.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parsippanymonthly.com/2007/year_in_review.html|title=Year in Review|work=Parsippany Monthly|accessdate=March 3, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913123907/http://www.parsippanymonthly.com/2007/year_in_review.html|archivedate=September 13, 2007|deadurl=yes|quote=Lake Parsippany resident Angelo Savoldi, now 93 years old, has wrestled against some of the greatest men ever to enter the ring, and was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2004.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of European Film Archives and Cinematheques''' (French: Association des Cinémathèques Européennes - ACE ) is an affiliation of 44 European national and regional film archives founded in 1991. Its role is to safeguard the European film heritage and make this rich audiovisual records collected and preserved by the various film archives accessible to the public. ACE is a regional branch of FIAF Fédération Internationale des Archives du Film / [[International Federation of Film Archives]]. ACE members are non-profit institutions committed to the FIAF Code of Ethics.

==History==

European film archives have been collecting, preserving, and restoring films and other materials relating to films since the 1930s. The collections range from pre-cinema apparatus to [[digital cinema]] files, all of which require specific methods, techniques and an extensive knowledge of [[film history]] for preservation.

In 1991, representatives of the most important  European film archives came together to create LUMIERE, a pan-European film restoration project.&lt;ref&gt;Bundesarchiv / Filmarchiv (Berlin, Koblenz), Münchner Stadtmuseum/Filmmuseum (Munich), Stiftung Deutsche Kinemathek (Berlin), National Film and Television Archive  (London), Cinémathèque Royale de Belgique (Brussels), Centre National du Cinéma (Bois d’Arcy), Cinémathèque Française (Paris), Cineteca del Comune di Bologna (Bologna), The Nederlands Filmmuseum (Amsterdam), Cinemateca Portugesa (Lissbon).&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first large-scale film restoration project funded by the MEDIA I Programme of the European community. The LUMIERE project lasted between 1991 and 1996, during which more than 1000 film titles were preserved and restored, 700 films were re-discovered and identified and a Joint European Filmography (JEF) was established.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine A Surowiec [Ed.] / The Lumiere Project; The European Film Archives at the Crossroads, Lisbon, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

ACE started in 1991 as the Association des Cinémathèques de la Communauté Européenne (ACE). After the end of the LUMIERE project in 1996, ACE began its active role in raising awareness of the cultural and economic value of European film heritage among policy makers and the audiovisual industry. Operating on the European level, ACE represents the interest of its members to the European Union. It works to support and improve the economic and legal conditions, as well as technical and scientific research for [[digitization]] and long-term [[film preservation]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Mazzanti, Peaceful Fish: Challenges of the Digital Era for Film Heritage Institutions.

==Protection of film heritage==
The European Commission directly supports efforts to protect Europe's film heritage. The legal basis for action is Article 167 of the TFEU (Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union), which encourages member states to support the conservation and safeguard of the cultural heritage, including film heritage. The Film Heritage Recommendation 2005&lt;ref&gt;Recommendation of European Parliament and Council Recommendation of 16 November 2005 on film heritage and the competitiveness of related industrial activities, OJ L 323 of 9.12.2005, p.57.
http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32005H0865:EN:NOT
&lt;/ref&gt; invites the member states to systematically collect, catalogue, preserve and restore Europe's film heritage.

'''Billhead receipts''' are [[receipt]]s that were commonly used in [[financial transaction|business transaction]]s from the late 1860s through the early 1940s. They can be found in present-day transactions, although they are less common today.

Many billhead receipts were illustrated and decorated with fancy [[steel engraving]]s, while others carried no illustrations. In either case, the receipt was important, as it stood as your [[proof of delivery]]. Most billheads would bear the company's name and address, a unique [[invoice]] number, the payment terms, line items for products or services, a total, and (optionally) handwritten notes.

==Vintage Ephemera==
Billheads are considered to be vintage [[ephemera]]. Some collect billheads from a certain state, region, or town; others base their collections on types of [[illustration]]s. In some cases, a relative or ancestor may have owned the business or even have [[signature|signed]] the document.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7298">[[File:Chronicle P.jpg|thumb|240px|A portion of Chronicle P referring to the events surrounding the reign of [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Records of the reign of Tikutli-Ninib I, King of Assyria, About B.C. 1275 | author = L. W. King | publisher = Luzac and Co. | year = 1904 | page = 51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Chronicle P''', known as ''Chronicle 22'' in Grayson’s ''Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles''&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{ cite book | title = Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles | author = A. K. Grayson | publisher = J. J. Augustin | year = 1975 | pages = 139–41 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Mesopotamia]]n Chronicle 45'': “Chronicle of the Kassite Kings” in Glassner’s Mesopotamian Chronicles&lt;ref name=mc&gt;{{ cite book | title = Mesopotamian Chronicles | author = Jean-Jacques Glassner | publisher = Society of Biblical Literature | year = 2004 | pages = 278–281 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is named for [[Theophilus Pinches|T. G. Pinches]], the first editor of the text. It is a chronicle of the second half of the second millennium BC or the [[Kassites|Kassite]] period, written by a first millennium BC [[Babylonia]]n scribe.

==The tablet==

The chronicle is preserved on a single fragment 180&amp;nbsp;mm wide and 120&amp;nbsp;mm long and is in fairly poor condition. It is the lower third of what was originally a large [[clay tablet]] inscribed with two columns of [[Akkadian cuneiform]] per side, and is held in the [[British Museum]], now bearing the museum reference BM 92701. Its provenance is unknown but the internal evidence from the script characteristics betrays it to be a late Babylonian copy. It was purchased by the museum from [[Spartali &amp; Co]] in 1882 and originally given the accession number 82-7-4, 38.

===The text===

[[File:Winckler Chronicle P.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Hugo Winckler]]’s line art for the Chronicle P.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | title = Text der Chronik P | author = Hugo Winckler | journal = Altorientalische Forschungen | year = 1895 | pages = 297–303 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The text is episodic, divided by horizontal lines into sections of differing length concerning the events of particular reigns. The narrative style switches from classic chronicler to epic poem when describing the events of the reign of [[Kurigalzu II]], suggesting more than one historical source was consulted in its preparation. Although the section concerning the deposing of the grandson of [[Ashur-uballit I|Aššur-uballiṭ I]] differs from the [[Assyria]]n ''Synchronistic History'' with respect to the names of the characters concerned, the identical phraseology suggests that the passages derive ultimately from a common source.&lt;ref name=mskh&gt;{{ cite book | title = Materials and Studies for Kassite History | chapter = The Chronicle Tradition Concerning the Deposing of the Grandson of Aššur-uballiṭ I | author = J. A. Brinkman | publisher = Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago | year = 1976 | pages = 418–423 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the section relating to Kurigalzu II and the [[Kurigalzu II#Battle of Sugagu|battle of Sugagu]] varies only in the name of his Assyrian counterpart and the outcome of the battle.

The narrative begins with discussion of a treaty and some form of restoration work, but the identity of the protagonist ([[Burnaburiash I|Burna-Buriyåš I]]?) is lost. It continues with a passage concerning [[Kadashman-harbe I|Kadašman-Ḫarbe I]] that has been interpreted as a confusion of the history of this earlier king with that of [[Kara-hardash|Kara-ḫardaš]], the short-lived successor to [[Burna-Buriash II|Burna-Buriaš II]].&lt;ref name=mskh/&gt; Kurigalzu’s victory against the [[Elam]]ites is likewise thought to confuse the campaign of [[Kurigalzu I]] with his later namesake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = L'hommage de l'élamite Untash-Napirisha au Cassite Burnaburiash | author = F. Vallat | journal = Akkadica | number = 114-115 | year = 2000 | pages = 109–117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The history then hops to the events surrounding Tukulti-Ninurta’s conquest of Babylonia, providing the only extant confirmation of his seven year rule through governors. It records the revolt which placed [[Adad-shuma-usur|Adad-šuma-uṣur]] on the throne and then describes the events surrounding Tukulti-Ninurta’s overthrow (by Aššur-nasir-apli, probably a reproduction of the error for [[Ashur-nadin-apli|Aššūr-nādin-apli]] on some copies of the [[Assyrian King List]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | title = The Assyrian King List and the Murderer of Tukulti-Ninurta I | author = Shigeo Yamada | journal = NABU | year = 1998 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The text concludes with two sections about the incursions of Elamite king Kidin-Ḫudrudiš, thought to represent Kidin-Hutran, against the Kassite monarchs [[Enlil-nadin-shumi|Enlil-nādin-šumi]] and [[Adad-shuma-iddina|Adad-šuma-iddina]], kings recorded as ''preceding'' Adad-šuma-uṣur on the [[Babylonian king list]]

The text is insufficiently preserved for it to be possible to ascertain its intended purpose. It contains a number of scribal errors, but, in marked contrast to the ''Synchronistic History'', it portrays Babylonian setbacks as matter of fact alongside their victories, which has led some modern historians to praise its impartiality, despite its apparent muddling of historical events.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;

===Principal publications===

Despite its fragmentary state, the text has been published by scholars in the following publications:

The '''''Claudine''''' series consists of four early novels by the French author [[Colette]], published 1900–1904.&lt;ref name=Southworth2004 &gt;{{citation | last=Southworth | first=Helen | year=2004 | title=The intersecting realities and fictions of Virginia Woolf and Colette | publisher=Ohio State University Press | isbn=978-0-8142-5136-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TP_q7KHL1EkC  | page=111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Written in diary form, they describe the growth to maturity of a young girl, Claudine. Aged fifteen at the beginning of the first book, ''[[Claudine à l'école]]'', the series describes her education and experiences as she grows up.&lt;ref name=Southworth2004 /&gt; All the books are written in [[first person narrative|first-person]] with the first three having Claudine herself as the narrator.  The last in the series, ''Claudine s'en va'', introduces a new narrator, Annie.&lt;ref name=Southworth2004 /&gt;

The novels were written in the late 19th century in collaboration with Colette's first husband, the writer [[Henry Gauthier-Villars]], better known by his [[nom-de-plume]] "Willy". There has been much speculation over the degree of involvement of both Colette and Willy in the writing of the Claudine novels, particularly as Willy was known for often using [[ghostwriter|ghostwriters]]. Consequently, although the novels were originally attributed to Willy only and published under his name alone, they were later published under both names. After the death of Willy, Colette went to court to challenge her former husband's involvement in any of the writing, and subsequently had his name removed from the books. This decision however was overturned after her death, as Willy's son from a prior relationship, [[Jacques Gauthier-Villars]], successfully sued to have his father's name restored.&lt;ref name=Southworth2004 /&gt;

The ''Claudine'' novels are thought to be roughly [[autobiography|autobiographical]].&lt;ref name=Southworth2004 /&gt; Whilst the stories were shocking in their time, this affectionate portrayal of a forthright and self-assured French girl who blossoms into a charismatic adult is nowadays more likely to be regarded as chastely sensual.

* ''[[Claudine à l'école]]'' (1900) – Claudine at School
* ''Claudine à Paris'' (1901) – Claudine in Paris
* ''Claudine en ménage'' (1902) – Claudine Married
* ''Claudine s'en va'' (1903) – Claudine and Annie

{{Literature}}
'''Comparative literature''' is an academic field dealing with the study of [[literature]] and cultural expression across [[language|linguistic]], [[nation]]al, and [[discipline|disciplinary]] boundaries. Comparative literature "performs a role similar to that of the study of [[international relations]], but works with languages and artistic traditions, so as to understand cultures 'from the inside'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/academics/comparative-literature/about|title=About Us - Comparative Literature|author=|date=|website=www.brown.edu|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While most frequently practiced with works of different languages, comparative literature may also be performed on works of the same language if the works originate from different nations or cultures among which that language is spoken.

The characteristically intercultural and transnational field of comparative literature concerns itself with the relation between literature, broadly defined, and other spheres of human activity, including [[history]], [[politics]], [[philosophy]], [[art]], and [[science]]. Unlike other forms of literary study, comparative literature places its emphasis on the interdisciplinary analysis of social and cultural production within the "[[economy]], political dynamics, cultural movements, historical shifts, religious differences, the urban environment, international relations, [[public policy]], and the sciences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://complit.princeton.edu/undergraduate-program/careers-comparative-literature|title=What careers do Comparative Literature majors have? - Comparative Literature|author=|date=|website=complit.princeton.edu|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Students and instructors in the field, usually called "comparatists", have traditionally been proficient in several languages and acquainted with the literary traditions, [[literary criticism]], and major literary texts of those languages. Many of the newer sub-fields, however, are more influenced by [[critical theory]] and [[literary theory]], stressing theoretical acumen and the ability to consider different types of art concurrently, over proficiency in multiple languages.

The [[interdisciplinary]] nature of the field means that comparatists typically exhibit acquaintance with [[sociology]], [[history]], [[anthropology]], [[translation studies]], critical theory, [[cultural studies]], and [[religious studies]]. As a result, comparative literature programs within universities may be designed by scholars drawn from several such departments. This [[eclecticism]] has led critics (from within and without) to charge that Comparative Literature is insufficiently well-defined, or that comparatists too easily fall into dilettantism, because the scope of their work is, of necessity, broad. Some question whether this breadth affects the ability of Ph.D.s to find employment in the highly specialized environment of academia and the career market at large, although such concerns do not seem to be borne out by placement data that shows comparative literature graduates to be hired at similar or higher rates than their peers in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.mla.org/jil_phd_survey_t2 |title=Placement of 1996-97 PhDs in Classics, Modern Languages, and Linguistics
|accessdate=Dec 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "comparative literature" and "world literature" are often used to designate a similar course of study and scholarship. Comparative Literature is the more widely used term in the United States, with many universities having Comparative Literature departments or Comparative Literature programs.

Comparative literature is an interdisciplinary field whose practitioners study literature across national borders, across time periods, across languages, across genres, across boundaries between literature and the other arts (music, painting, dance, film, etc.), across disciplines (literature and psychology, philosophy, science, history, architecture, sociology, politics, etc.). Defined most broadly, comparative literature is the study of "literature without borders". Scholarship in comparative literature include, for example, studying literacy and social status in the Americas, studying medieval epic and romance, studying the links of literature to folklore and mythology, studying colonial and postcolonial writings in different parts of the world, asking fundamental questions about definitions of literature itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lernout |first=Geert |authorlink=Geert Lernout |year=2006 |title=Comparative Literature in the Low Countries |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/comparative_critical_studies/v003/3.1lernout.html |journal=Comparative Critical Studies |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=37–46 |publisher=British Comparative Literature |accessdate=Dec 18, 2011 | quote = When I tell members of the general public, in airplanes or hotel bars, what I do for a living, the most common reply has always been: 'What do you guys compare literature to?' Nowadays I tend to answer: 'With everything else.' If I look at the courses I have given over the years, this is not even an exaggeration – I have taught courses on literature 'And Very Nearly Everything Else': literature and music, literature and the arts, literature and science, psychology, religion, sociology, history, philosophy. The trouble with literature, however defined, is that you cannot even begin to grasp its complexity if you do not fully understand its relationship to, well, everything else. In my personal life this has meant that I have found the perfect academic excuse for an unquenchable thirst for all kinds of information, some more, some less arcane (less charitably it could be argued that this has saved me from having to make up my Kierkegaardian mind about what I really want to do with my life). }}&lt;/ref&gt; What scholars in comparative literature share is a desire to study literature beyond national boundaries and an interest in languages so that they can read foreign texts in their original form. Many comparatists also share the desire to integrate literary experience with other cultural phenomena such as historical change, philosophical concepts, and social movements.

The discipline of comparative literature has scholarly associations such as the [http://www.ailc-icla.org/site/ ICLA: International Comparative Literature Association] and comparative literature associations exists in many countries: for a list of such see [https://web.archive.org/web/20070206071440/http://www.bcla.org/index.htm BCLA: British Comparative Literature Association]; for the US, see [http://www.acla.org/ ACLA: American Comparative Literature Association]. There are many learned journals that publish scholarship in comparative literature: see "Selected Comparative Literature and Comparative Humanities Journals"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/clcweblibrary/comparativehumanitiesjournals/
|title=Selected Comparative Literature and Comparative Humanities Journals |accessdate=Dec 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
and for a list of books in comparative literature see "Bibliography of (Text)Books in Comparative Literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/clcweblibrary/comparativeliteraturebooks/ |title=Bibliography of (Text)Books in Comparative Literature |accessdate=Dec 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work==
Work considered foundational to the discipline of comparative literature include Transylvanian Hungarian [[Hugó Meltzl|Hugo Meltzl]] de Lomnitz's scholarship, also the founding editor of the journal ''Acta Comparationis Litterarum Universarum'' (1877) and Irish scholar [[H.M. Posnett]]'s ''Comparative Literature'' (1886). However, antecedents can be found in the ideas of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] in his vision of "[[world literature]]" (''Weltliteratur)'' and [[Russian Formalists]] credited [[Alexander Veselovsky]] with laying the groundwork for the discipline. [[Viktor Zhirmunsky]], for instance, referred to Veselovsky as "the most remarkable representative of comparative literary study in Russian and European scholarship of the nineteenth century" (Zhirmunsky qtd. in Rachel Polonsky, ''English Literature and the Russian Aesthetic Renaissance'' [Cambridge UP, 1998. 17]; see also David Damrosch&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

During the late 19th century, comparatists such as [[Fyodor Buslaev]] were chiefly concerned with deducing the purported [[Zeitgeist]] or "spirit of the times", which they assumed to be embodied in the literary output of each nation. Although many comparative works from this period would be judged chauvinistic, [[Eurocentric]], or even racist by present-day standards, the intention of most scholars during this period was to increase the understanding of other cultures, not to assert superiority over them (although politicians and others from outside the field sometimes used their works for this purpose).{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==French School==
{{Expand section|date=June 2017}}
From the early part of the 20th century until [[World War II|WWII]], the field was characterised by a notably empiricist and positivist approach, termed the "French School", in which scholars examined works forensically, looking for evidence of "origins" and "influences" between works from different nations. Thus a scholar might attempt to trace how a particular literary idea or motif traveled between nations over time. In the French School of Comparative Literature, the study of influences and mentalities dominates. Today, the French School practices the nation-state approach of the discipline although it also promotes the approach of a "European Comparative Literature".

==German School==
Like the French School, German Comparative Literature has its origins in the late 19th century. After World War II, the discipline developed to a large extent owing to one scholar in particular, [[Peter Szondi]] (1929–1971), a Hungarian who taught at the [[Free University Berlin]]. Szondi's work in Allgemeine und Vergleichende Literaturwissenschaft (German for "General and Comparative Literary Studies") included the genre of drama, lyric (in particular hermetic) poetry, and [[hermeneutics]]: "Szondi's vision of Allgemeine und Vergleichende Literaturwissenschaft became evident in both his policy of inviting international guest speakers to Berlin and his introductions to their talks. Szondi welcomed, among others, [[Jacques Derrida]] (before he attained worldwide recognition), [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Lucien Goldman]] from France, [[Paul de Man]] from Zürich, [[Gershom Sholem]] from Jerusalem, [[Theodor W. Adorno]] from Frankfurt, [[Hans Robert Jauss]] from the then young [[University of Konstanz]], and from the US [[René Wellek]], [[Geoffrey Hartman]] and [[Peter Demetz]] (all at Yale), along with the liberal publicist [[Lionel Trilling]]. The names of these visiting scholars, who form a programmatic network and a methodological canon, epitomise Szondi's conception of comparative literature. German comparatists working in East Germany, however, were not invited, nor were recognised colleagues from France or the Netherlands. Yet while he was oriented towards the West and the new allies of West Germany and paid little attention to comparatists in Eastern Europe, his conception of a transnational (and transatlantic) comparative literature was very much influenced by East European literary theorists of the Russian and Prague schools of structuralism, from whose works René Wellek, too, derived many of his concepts, concepts that continue to have profound implications for comparative literary theory today" ... A manual published by [http://www.komparatistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html the department of comparative literature at the LMU Munich] lists 31 German departments which offer a diploma in comparative literature in Germany, albeit some only as a 'minor'. These are: Augsburg, Bayreuth, Free University Berlin, Technical University Berlin, Bochum, Bonn, Chemnitz-Zwickau, Erfurt, Erlangen-Nürnberg, Essen, Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurt an der Oder, Gießen, [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], Jena, Karlsruhe, Kassel, Konstanz, Leipzig, Mainz, [http://www.komparatistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html München], Münster, Osnabrück, Paderborn, Potsdam, Rostock, Saarbrücken, Siegen, Stuttgart, [https://web.archive.org/web/20100227092837/http://www.germ.uni-tuebingen.de/abteilungen/Komparatistik/index.html Tübingen], Wuppertal. (Der kleine Komparatist [2003]). This situation is undergoing rapid change, however, since many universities are adapting to the new requirements of the recently introduced Bachelor and Master of Arts. German comparative literature is being squeezed by the traditional philologies on the one hand and more vocational programmes of study on the other which seek to offer students the practical knowledge they need for the working world (e.g., 'Applied Literature'). With German universities no longer educating their students primarily for an academic market, the necessity of a more vocational approach is becoming ever more evident".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lubrich | first=Oliver |authorlink=Oliver Lubrich |year=2006 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/comparative_critical_studies/v003/3.1lubrich.html

|journal=Comparative Critical Studies |volume=3 |issue=1 | pages=47–67 |publisher=British Comparative Literature |accessdate=Dec 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American (US) School==
Reacting to the French School, postwar scholars, collectively termed the "American School", sought to return the field to matters more directly concerned with [[literary criticism]], de-emphasising the detective work and detailed historical research that the French School had demanded. The American School was more closely aligned with the original internationalist visions of Goethe and Posnett (arguably reflecting the postwar desire for international cooperation), looking for examples of universal human "truths" based on the literary archetypes that appeared throughout literatures from all times and places.

Prior to the advent of the American School, the scope of comparative literature in the West was typically limited to the literatures of Western Europe and Anglo-America, predominantly literature in [[English literature|English]], [[German literature|German]] and [[French literature]], with occasional forays into [[Italian literature]] (primarily for [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]) and [[Spanish literature]] (primarily for [[Cervantes]]). One monument to the approach of this period is [[Erich Auerbach]]'s book ''[[Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature]]'', a survey of techniques of [[realism (arts)|realism]] in texts whose origins span several continents and three thousand years.

The approach of the American School would be familiar to current practitioners of cultural studies and is even claimed by some to be the forerunner of the Cultural Studies boom in universities during the 1970s and 1980s. The field today is highly diverse: for example, comparatists routinely study [[Chinese literature]], [[Arabic literature]] and the literatures of most other major world languages and regions as well as English and continental European literatures.

==Current developments==
There is a movement among comparativists in the United States and elsewhere to re-focus the discipline away from the nation-based approach with which it has previously been associated towards a cross-cultural approach that pays no heed to national borders.  Works of this nature include [[Alamgir Hashmi]]'s ''The Commonwealth, Comparative Literature and the World'',  [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]]'s ''Death of a Discipline'', David Damrosch's ''What is World Literature?'', Steven Tötösy de Zepetnek's concept of "comparative cultural studies", and Pascale Casanova's ''The World Republic of Letters''.  It remains to be seen whether this approach will prove successful given that comparative literature had its roots in nation-based thinking and much of the literature under study still concerns issues of the nation-state.  Given developments in the studies of globalization and interculturalism, comparative literature, already representing a wider study than the single-language nation-state approach, may be well suited to move away from the paradigm of the nation-state. While in the West comparative literature is experiencing institutional constriction, there are signs that in many parts of the world the discipline is thriving, especially in Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Mediterranean. Current trends in Transnational studies also reflect the growing importance of post-colonial literary figures such as [[Giannina Braschi]], [[J. M. Coetzee]], [[Maryse Condé]], [[Earl Lovelace]], [[V. S. Naipaul]], [[Michael Ondaatje]], [[Wole Soyinka]], [[Derek Walcott]], and [[Lasana M. Sekou]].

'''''Crazy House''''' is a [[1943 in film|1943]] [[comedy film]] starring [[Ole Olsen (comedian)|Ole Olsen]] and [[Chic Johnson]] as Broadway stars who return to [[Universal Studios]] to make another movie. The mere mention of Olsen and Johnson's names evacuates the studio and terrorizes the management and personnel. Undaunted, the comedians hire an assistant director and unknown talent, and set out to make their own movie. Financed by an eccentric "angel" ([[Percy Kilbride]]), the completed feature is set to premiere when angry creditors confiscate most of the film. Olsen and Johnson keep the preview going, anyway, and their venture is a success.

''Crazy House'' is notable for its impressive cast of supporting comedians (Percy Kilbride, [[Cass Daley]], [[Shemp Howard]], [[Edgar Kennedy]], [[Franklin Pangborn]], [[Billy Gilbert]], [[Dick Lane (TV announcer)|Richard Lane]], [[Andrew Tombes]], [[Chester Clute]], and [[Hans Conried]]) and guest stars under contract to Universal at the time ([[Allan Jones (actor)|Allan Jones]], [[Basil Rathbone]] and [[Nigel Bruce]], [[Robert Paige]], [[Leo Carrillo]], [[Johnny Mack Brown]], [[Andy Devine]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="995">In '''''Ex parte Van Heerden''''', an important case in [[South African insolvency law]], “It is necessary,” the court held, “to consider whether the surplus of the proceeds of the immovable property, after satisfying the mortgage bonds which have a preferential claim thereon, can be considered as ‘free residue’ within the meaning of that expression as used in the Act.” The definition of “free residue” must be taken to refer to that portion of an estate under sequestration when liquidated, which is not subject to any right of preference. In estimating the free residue in an estate, the surplus in value of immovable property over the amount of mortgage bonds thereon may be included in such estimate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31421">'''Exception handling syntax''' is the set of keywords and/or structures provided by a computer [[programming language]] to allow [[exception handling]], which separates the handling of errors that arise during a program's operation from its ordinary processes. Syntax for exception handling varies between [[programming language]]s, partly to cover semantic differences but largely to fit into each language's overall [[syntax#Syntax in computer science|syntactic structure]]. Some languages do not call the relevant concept '[[exception handling]]'; others may not have direct facilities for it, but can still provide means to implement it.

Most commonly, error handling uses a &lt;code&gt;try...[catch...][finally...]&lt;/code&gt; block, and errors are created via a &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; statement, but there is significant variation in naming and syntax.

== Catalogue of exception handling syntaxes ==

=== Ada ===
{{Further information|Ada (programming language)}}
{{Wikibooks|Ada Programming|Exceptions}}

; Exception declarations
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ada"&gt;
Some_Error : exception;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

; Raising exceptions
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ada"&gt;
raise Some_Error;

raise Some_Error with "Out of memory"; -- specific diagnostic message
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

; Exception handling and propagation
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ada"&gt;
with Ada.Exceptions, Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Foo is
  Some_Error : exception;
begin
  Do_Something_Interesting;
exception -- Start of exception handlers
  when Constraint_Error =&gt;
    ... -- Handle constraint error
  when Storage_Error =&gt;
    -- Propagate Storage_Error as a different exception with a useful message
    raise Some_Error with "Out of memory";
  when Error : others =&gt; 
    -- Handle all others
    Ada.Text_IO.Put("Exception: ");
    Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line(Ada.Exceptions.Exception_Name(Error));
    Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line(Ada.Exceptions.Exception_Message(Error));
end Foo;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Assembly language ===
{{Further information|Assembly language}}
Most assembly languages will have a macro instruction or an interrupt address available for the particular system to intercept events such as illegal op codes, program check, data errors, overflow, divide by zero, and other such. IBM and Univac mainframes had the [[STXIT]] macro. Digital Equipment Corporation [[RT11]] systems had trap vectors for program errors, i/o interrupts, and such. [[DOS]] has certain interrupt addresses. [[Microsoft Windows]] has specific module calls to trap program errors.

=== Bash ===
{{Further information|Bash (Unix shell)}}

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="bash"&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#set -e provides another error mechanism
print_error(){
	echo "there was an error"
}
trap print_error exit #list signals to trap
tempfile=`mktemp`
trap "rm $tempfile" exit
./other.sh || echo warning: other failed
echo oops)
echo never printed
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

One can set a trap for multiple errors, responding to any signal with syntax like:

: {{code|2=bash|trap 'echo Error at line ${LINENO}' ERR}}

=== BASIC ===
{{Further information|BASIC}}
An ''On Error goto/gosub'' structure is used in BASIC and is quite different from modern exception handling; in BASIC there is only one global handler whereas in modern exception handling, exception handlers are stacked.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="qbasic"&gt;
ON ERROR GOTO handler
OPEN "Somefile.txt" FOR INPUT AS #1
CLOSE #1
PRINT "File opened successfully"
END

handler:
PRINT "File does not exist"
END  ' RESUME may be used instead which returns control to original position.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== C ===
{{Further information|C (programming language)}}
The most common way to implement exception handling in standard C is to use [[setjmp.h|setjmp/longjmp]] functions:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c"&gt;
#include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

enum { SOME_EXCEPTION = 1 } exception;
jmp_buf state;

int main(void)
{
  if(!setjmp(state))                      // try
  {
    if(/* something happened */)
    {
      exception = SOME_EXCEPTION;
      longjmp(state, 0);                  // throw SOME_EXCEPTION
    }
  } 
  else switch(exception)
  {             
    case SOME_EXCEPTION:                  // catch SOME_EXCEPTION
      puts("SOME_EXCEPTION caught");
      break;
    default:                              // catch ...
      puts("Some strange exception");
  }
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==== Microsoft-specific ====
{{Further information|Microsoft-specific exception handling mechanisms}}
Two types exist:
* Structured Exception Handling (SEH)
* Vectored Exception Handling (VEH, introduced in [[Windows XP]])
Example of SEH in C programming language:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c"&gt;
int filterExpression (EXCEPTION_POINTERS* ep) {
   ep-&gt;ContextRecord-&gt;Eip += 8; // divide instruction may be encoded from 2 to 8 bytes
   return EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION;
}
int main(void) {
   static int zero;
   __try {
       zero = 1/zero;
       __asm {
         nop
         nop
         nop
         nop
         nop
         nop
         nop
       }
       printf ("Past the exception.\n");
   } __except (filterExpression (GetExceptionInformation())) {
       printf ("Handler called.\n");
   }
   return 0;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== C# ===
{{Further information|C Sharp (programming language)}}
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="csharp"&gt;
public static void Main()
{
   try
   {
      // Code that could throw an exception
   }
   catch(System.Net.WebException ex)
   {
      // Process a WebException
   }
   catch(System.Exception)
   {
      // Process a System level CLR exception, that is not a System.Net.WebException,
      // since the exception has not been given an identifier it cannot be referenced
   }
   catch
   {
      // Process a non-CLR exception
   }
   finally
   {
      // (optional) code that will *always* execute
   }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== C++ ===
{{Further information|C++}}
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="cpp"&gt;
#include &lt;exception&gt;
int main() {
   try {
       // do something (might throw an exception)
   }
   catch (const std::exception&amp; e) {
        // handle exception e
   }
   catch (...) {
        // catches all exceptions, not already caught by a catch block before
        // can be used to catch exception of unknown or irrelevant type
   }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
In C++, a ''[[Resource Acquisition Is Initialization|resource acquisition is initialization]]'' technique can be used to clean up resources in exceptional situations. C++ intentionally does not support {{Cpp|finally}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq2.html#finally Bjarne Stroustrup's FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The outer braces for the method are optional.

=== ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML) ===

&lt;cfscript&gt;
try {
	//throw CF9+
	throw(type="TypeOfException", message="Oops", detail="xyz");
	// alternate throw syntax:
	throw "Oops"; // this equivalent to the "message" value in the above example

==== Railo-Lucee specific syntax ====
{{Further information|Railo|Lucee}}
Added to the standard syntax above, CFML dialects of [[Railo]] and [[Lucee]] allow a &lt;code&gt;retry&lt;/code&gt; statement.&lt;ref&gt;https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RAILO-2176 # JBoss Community issue tracker ticket for adding &lt;code&gt;retry&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

This statement returns processing to the start of the prior &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block.

CFScript example:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="javascript"&gt;
try {
	// code which could result in an exception 

} catch (any e){
	retry;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Tag-syntax example:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="cfm"&gt;
&lt;cftry&gt;

	&lt;!--- code which could result in an exception ---&gt;

	&lt;cfcatch&gt;
		&lt;cfretry&gt;
	&lt;/cfcatch&gt;
&lt;/cftry&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== D ===
{{Further information|D (programming language)}}
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="d"&gt;
import std.stdio; // for writefln()
int main() {
  try {
      // do something that might throw an exception
  }
  catch (FooException e) {
       // handle exceptions of type FooException
  }
  catch (Object o) {
       // handle any other exceptions
       writefln("Unhandled exception: ", o);
       return 1;
  }
  return 0;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
In D, a {{D-lang|finally}} clause or the [[Resource Acquisition Is Initialization|resource acquisition is initialization]] technique can be used to clean up resources in exceptional situations.

  // Code to execute whether or not an exception is raised (e.g., clean-up code).
end;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

  % some dangerous code
catch
  throw:{someError, X} -&gt; ok;    % handle an exception
  error:X -&gt; ok;                 % handle another exception
  _:_ -&gt; ok                      % handle all exceptions

  % clean up
end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Haskell ===
{{Further information|Haskell (programming language)}}
Haskell does not have special syntax for exceptions. Instead, a {{Haskell|try}}/{{Haskell|catch}}/{{Haskell|finally}}/{{Haskell|etc}}. interface is provided by functions.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
import Prelude hiding(catch)
import Control.Exception
instance Exception Int
instance Exception Double
main = do
  catch
    (catch
      (throw (42::Int))
      (\e-&gt; print (0,e::Double)))
    (\e-&gt; print (1,e::Int))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

prints

 (1,42)

in analogy with this C++

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c"&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
int main()
{
  try
    {throw (int)42;}
  catch(double e)
    {cout &lt;&lt; "(0," &lt;&lt; e &lt;&lt; ")" &lt;&lt; endl;}
  catch(int e)
    {cout &lt;&lt; "(1," &lt;&lt; e &lt;&lt; ")" &lt;&lt; endl;}
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Another example is

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
do {
  -- Statements in which errors might be thrown
} `catch` \ex -&gt; do {
  -- Statements that execute in the event of an exception, with 'ex' bound to the exception
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In purely functional code, if only one error condition exists, the {{Haskell|Maybe}} type may be sufficient, and is an instance of Haskell's {{Haskell|Monad}} [[type class|class]] by default. More complex error propagation can be achieved using the {{Haskell|Error}} or {{Haskell|ErrorT}} monads, for which similar functionality (using {{Haskell|`catch`}}) is supported.

         or by setting the environment variable OCAMLRUNPARAM="b1"*)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Perl 5===
{{Further information|Perl}}
The [[Perl]] mechanism for exception handling uses {{Perl2|die}} to throw an exception when wrapped inside an {{Perl2|eval { ... };}} block. After the {{Perl2|eval}}, the special variable {{Perl2|$@}} contains the value passed from {{Perl2|die}}. However, scoping issues can make doing this correctly quite ugly:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="perl"&gt;
my ( $error, $failed );
{
   local $@;
   $failed = not eval {
       # Code that could throw an exception (using 'die')
       open(FILE, $file) || die "Could not open file: $!";
       while (&lt;FILE&gt;) {
           process_line($_);
       }
       close(FILE) || die "Could not close $file: $!";
       return 1;
   };
   $error = $@;
}

if ( $failed ) {
   warn "got error: $error";
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Perl 5.005 added the ability to throw objects as well as strings. This allows better introspection and handling of types of exceptions.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="perl"&gt;
eval {
  open(FILE, $file) || die MyException::File-&gt;new($!);
  while (&lt;FILE&gt;) {
    process_line($_);
  }
  close(FILE) || die MyException::File-&gt;new($!);
};
if ($@) {
  # The exception object is in $@
  if ($@-&gt;isa('MyException::File')) {
    # Handle file exception
  } else {
    # Generic exception handling
    # or re-throw with 'die $@'
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The {{Perl2|__DIE__}} pseudo-signal can be trapped to handle calls to {{Perl2|die}}. This is not suitable for exception handling since it is global. However it can be used to convert string-based exceptions from third-party packages into objects.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="perl"&gt;
local $SIG{__DIE__} = sub {
  my $err = shift;
  if ($err-&gt;isa('MyException')) {
    die $err; # re-throw
  } else {
    # Otherwise construct a MyException with $err as a string
    die MyException::Default-&gt;new($err);
  }
};
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The forms shown above can sometimes fail if the global variable {{Perl2|$@}} is changed between when the exception is thrown and when it is checked in the {{Perl2|if ($@)}} statement. This can happen in multi-threaded environments, or even in single-threaded environments when other code (typically
called in the destruction of some object) resets the global variable before the checking code.
The following example shows a way to avoid this problem (see [http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?exception_handling]). But at the cost of not being able to use return values:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="perl"&gt;
eval {
  # Code that could throw an exception (using 'die') but does NOT use the return statement;
  1;
} or do {
  # Handle exception here. The exception string is in $@
};
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Several modules in the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network ([[CPAN]]) expand on the basic mechanism:
* {{Perl2|Error}} provides a set of exception classes and allows use of the try/throw/catch/finally syntax.
* {{Perl2|TryCatch}} and {{Perl2|Try::Tiny}} both allow use of try/catch/finally syntax instead of boilerplate to handle exceptions correctly.
* {{Perl2|Exception::Class}} is a base class and class-maker for derived exception classes. It provides a full structured [[stack trace]] in {{Perl2|$@-&gt;trace}} and {{Perl2|$@-&gt;trace-&gt;as_string}}.
* {{Perl2|Fatal}} overloads previously defined functions that return true/false e.g., {{Perl2|open}}, {{Perl2|close}}, {{Perl2|read}}, {{Perl2|write}}, etc. This allows built-in functions and others to be used as if they threw exceptions.

New exceptions may be created using the {{S-Lang|new_exception}} function, e.g., 
  new_exception ("MyIOError", IOError, "My I/O Error");
will create an exception called {{S-Lang|MyIOError}} as a subclass of {{S-Lang|IOError}}. Exceptions may be generated using the throw statement, which can throw arbitrary [[S-Lang (programming language)|S-Lang]] objects.

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The general mechanism is provided by the message {{Smalltalk|on:do:}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pharobyexample.org/ Pharo by Example]&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions are just normal objects that subclass {{Smalltalk|Error}}, you throw one by creating an instance and sending it a {{Smalltalk|#signal}} message, e.g., {{Smalltalk|MyException new signal}}. The handling mechanism ({{Smalltalk|#on:do:}}) is again just a normal message implemented by {{Smalltalk|BlockClosure}}. The thrown exception is passed as a parameter to the handling block closure, and can be queried, as well as potentially sending {{Smalltalk|#resume}} to it, to allow execution flow to continue.

A '''foot of fine''' (plural, '''feet of fines'''; [[Latin]]: '''''pes finis'''''; plural, '''''pedes finium''''') is the archival copy of the agreement between two parties in an [[England|English]] [[lawsuit]] over land, most commonly the [[Legal fiction|fictitious]] suit (in reality a [[Conveyancing|conveyance]]) known as a [[fine of lands]] or final concord. The procedure was followed from ''c''.1195 until 1833, and the considerable body of resulting records is now held at [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]], [[Kew]], London.

==History==
In the reign of [[Henry II of England]], the royal justices first began the practice of registering the settlement of disagreements over land by having both parties bring a suit before the royal courts. The resulting decision was thus given ''royal sanction''.

At first, two copies of the agreement ("fine") were made, created as [[chirograph]]s: i.e. the text was written in duplicate on a single piece of parchment, which was then cut in half, one copy going to each of the litigants. Under [[Hubert Walter]]'s justiciarship, probably about 1195, the practice was started of writing the text in triplicate, so that a third copy could be filed in the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]]. This copy of the text was written at the foot of the piece of parchment, and so became known as the "foot of the fine", or simply "foot of fine".

The first recorded foot of fine is endorsed with the statement "This is the first [[chirograph]] that was made in the king's court in the form of three chirographs, according to the command of his lordship of Canterbury and other barons of the king, to the end that by this form a record can be made to be passed on to the treasurer to put in the treasury."&lt;ref name=QClanchy68&gt;Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'' p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement concerns Walter's brother Theobald, who was the plaintiff.&lt;ref name=Clanchy68&gt;Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'' pp. 68-73&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few years, the practice of recording feet of fines had spread widely, and even to Scotland, as in 1198 an agreement between [[William de Brus, 3rd Lord of Annandale|William de Bruce]] of Annandale and Adam of Carlisle over eight ploughgates in [[Lockerbie, Scotland|Lockerbie]], Scotland was filed with the English treasury, recorded with those from [[Northumberland]].&lt;ref name=Clanchy68/&gt; While early fines could be made in the [[Exchequer]], after the early 14th century, fines were always made in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]].

The practice survived until fines were abolished by the [[Fines and Recoveries Act 1833|Fines and Recoveries Act]] of 1833.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5716">'''FitSM''' is the name for a family of standards for lightweight [[IT service management]] (ITSM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitsm.eu |title=FitSM |publisher=FedSM Project |date= |accessdate=2015-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview and parts==
[[File:FitSM Tree.png|thumb|Structure of FitSM parts]]

FitSM calls itself a [[Technical standard|standard]], but is not published or managed by an established standards organisation like [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]. 
However, in a way very similar to that of many ISO and ISO/IEC standard families, it structures its documents into several numbered parts and defines requirements for an effective service management system in its part 1.

All parts are published under [[Creative Commons license|Creative Common licenses]].

===FitSM-0: Overview and vocabulary===
A single document containing about 70 definitions of ITSM terms.

===FitSM-1: Requirements===
A single document containing about 85 auditable requirements for an effective service management system.
The requirements are divided into general requirements (GR) and requirements for 14 different service management processes (PR).
FitSM is similar in scope and style to part 1 of [[ISO/IEC 20000]], but significantly shorter.

===FitSM-2: Objectives and activities===
A single document containing a description of the goal of each process defined in FitSM-1, as well as a description of activities to initially set up the process and ongoing process activities.

===FitSM-3: Role model===
A single document containing descriptions of generic service management system and service management process roles.

===FitSM-4: Templates and samples===
A collection of templates and samples for documents needed in a service management system, e.g. [[Service-level agreement|SLAs]], statement of a service management [[policy]], elements of a service portfolio or [[service catalogue]] etc. 

===FitSM-5: Guides===
A collection of guides on various ITSM topics.

===FitSM-6: Maturity assessment===
An Excel-based tool that uses situation descriptions to aid an easy assessment of the maturity of implemented service management processes and general practices.

==Certification and qualification scheme==
[[File:FitSM qualification scheme.png|thumb|FitSM qualification scheme]]

While conformance to FitSM-1 requirements can be audited, there is no certification for conformance. Unlike for ISO/IEC 20000, organizations cannot have their service management system 'FitSM certified'.

A qualification and certification scheme for personnel, much like those established for [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library#Certification|ITIL]] and [[ISO/IEC 20000#Certifications and qualification schemes|ISO/IEC 20000]], but involving fewer and shorter trainings, was started in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holsinger |first=Sy |date=2013-10-16 |title=Getting certified in federated IT service management |url=http://www.isgtw.org/spotlight/getting-certified-federated-it-service-management |journal= International science grid this week|access-date=2015-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By passing an exam, usually in the context of a one-day or two-day training, individuals can achieve several levels of certification, from a "foundation level", targeted at all personnel involved, up to an "expert level", targeted at process and overall ITSM project managers.
Certifications are issued by the [[TÜV SÜD]] Examination Institute.

==Origin==

FitSM is based on deliverables of FedSM, a project funded in the [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development#Framework Programme 7|7th Framework Program for Research and Technological Development]] by the European Union.
The original aim of FedSM was to "increase maturity and effectiveness of Service Management in federated e-Infrastructures by applying suitable good practices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fitsm.itemo.org/wp1 |title=FedSM Quality Assurance (QA) Plan|publisher=FedSM Project |date= |accessdate=2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How to establish management processes across federated organizational structures is not considered in traditional ITSM frameworks, and can pose a difficult task when trying to introduce ITSM in [[E-infrastructure]]s which often distribute the provisioning of services among a federation of peer organizations.
However, a much larger challenge to introducing ITSM at FedSM's client organizations turned out be the adaptation of the very comprehensive ITSM guidance described by traditional ITSM frameworks to a set of practices that could realistically be implemented in relatively small organizations within the project lifetime of three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Radecki |first=Marcin |last2=Szymocha |first2=Tadeusz | last3=Szepieniec |first3=Tomasz |last4=Różańska |first4=Roksana |date=2014-01-01 |title=Improving PL-Grid Operations Based on FitSM Standard|journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |publisher= Springer International Publishing|volume=8500 |issue= |pages=94–105 |doi= 10.1007/978-3-319-10894-0_7}}&lt;!--|access-date=11 February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
From May 2013, to foster the beginning interest in FedSM's "lightweight" ITSM guidance by IT organizations from outside the e-Infrastructure community, the project consortium started publishing revised versions project deliverables under the FitSM name.

The team members have announced on their project website that the FitSM standard will continue to be maintained in the future within the framework of a working group of IT Education Management Organisation [http://www.itemo.org/topic/fitsm-a-free-standard-for-lightweight-it-service-management ITEMO].

[[File:Flora Lapponica (frontispiece).jpg|thumb|right|200px|&lt;center&gt;Frontispiece of ''Flora Lapponica''&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''''Flora Lapponica''''' (Amsterdam, 1737) is an account of the plants of [[Lapland (region)|Lapland]] written by [[botanist]], [[zoologist]] and [[naturalist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707-1788) following his [[expedition to Lapland]].

Over the period from 12 May 1732 to 10 September 1732, and with a grant from the [[Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala]] for his journey,&lt;ref name="Anderson42-43"&gt;[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blunt2001-38"&gt;[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Linnaeus was able to combine his interest in medicine with that of natural history to travel for five months in Lapland collecting animals, plants, and minerals.

In ''Flora Lapponica'' Linnaeus’s ideas about [[nomenclature]] and [[Biological classification|classification]] were first used in a practical way, making this the first proto-modern [[flora]].&lt;ref&gt;Frodin, David 2002. ''Guide to Standard Floras of the World, 2nd ed''.  Cambridge University Press: Cambridge. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The account covered 534 species, used the Linnaean classification system and included, for the described species, geographical distribution and taxonomic notes. It was [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]] who attributed Linnaeus with ''Flora Lapponica'' as the first example in the botanical genre of Flora writing. Botanical historian [[Edward Lee Greene|E.L. Greene]] described ''Flora Lapponica'' as “the most classic and delightful of Linnaeus’s writings”.

A Lapland plant, ''[[Linnaea borealis]]'', was named by the eminent botanist [[Jan Frederik Gronovius]] in commemoration of Linnaeus's achievements. In the ''[[Critica Botanica]]'' Linnaeus uses this name to advocate the use of commemorative personal names as botanical names:

{{cquote|''it is commonly believed that the name of a plant which is derived from that of a botanist shows no connection between the two...[but]...Linnaea was named by the celebrated [[Jan Frederik Gronovius|Gronovius]] and is a plant of Lapland, lowly, insignificant, disregarded, flowering but for a brief space — after Linnaeus who resembles it.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Frans Stafleu|Stafleu, Frans A.]] 1971. ''Linnaeus and the Linnaeans: the Spreading of their Ideas in Systematic Botany, 1735–1789''. Utrecht: International Association for Plant Taxonomy. {{ISBN|90-6046-064-2}}. p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Haynes Owner's Workshop Manuals''' (commonly known as simply '''Haynes Manuals''') are a series of practical manuals from the British publisher Haynes Publishing Group. The series primarily focuses upon the [[Car maintenance|maintenance]] and repair of automotive vehicles, covering a wide range of makes and models (300 models of car and 130 models of motorcycle); the manuals are aimed mainly at [[Do it yourself|DIY]] enthusiasts rather than professional [[Automobile repair shop|garage]] mechanics, as they lack the depth of coverage on particular vehicles or problems. The series includes manuals in the same style for [[domestic appliance]]s and [[personal computer]]s, digital photography, [[model railway]]s, men&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.menshealthforum.org.uk/mini-manuals/19009-mens-health-forum-mini-manuals |title=The Enlarged Prostate |publisher=Men's Health Forum in association with Haynes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and

Additionally, Haynes have released manuals based on popular fictional series including ''[[Star Trek]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trekmovie.com/2010/04/24/cover-details-for-haynes-uss-enterprise-manual-details-on-typhon-pact-book-series/| title=Cover &amp; Details For Haynes USS Enterprise Manual + Details On ‘Typhon Pact’ Book Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Thomas and Friends]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haynes.co.uk/thomas/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Haynes manuals are named after John Harold Haynes. In 1956, when he was at school, he wrote and published a book on building a '[[homebuilt car|special]]' based on the [[Austin 7]], and wrote two further books while performing [[national service]] in the [[Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref name="Llewellin"&gt;{{cite news |last=Llewellin |first=Phil |date=20 November 1993 |title=Every car mechanic's favourite publisher: John Haynes has made a fortune from workshop manuals, and he has spent it on old cars |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/1505418.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=12 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; J. H. Haynes &amp; Co. Limited was founded on 18 May 1960 and the first manual actually entitled "Haynes Owners Workshop Manual", for the [[Austin-Healey Sprite]], was published in 1965.&lt;ref name="Llewellin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/00659701 |title=Haynes Publishing Group Public Limited Company |publisher=[[Companies House]] |access-date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haynes was made an Officer of [[Order of the British Empire]] in the [[1995 Birthday Honours|Queen's Birthday Honours List 1995]] for services to publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=54066 |date=17 June 1995 |page=11 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Haynes Manuals bear a cover illustration of a cutaway view technical drawing of the vehicle, hand-drawn by Terry Davey, and they bear his signature.

In 2013, Haynes acquired [[Clymer repair manual]]s from [[Penton Media]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foliomag.com/2013/ubm-sells-second-property-week UBM Sells Second Property This Week]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stripdown and rebuild==
The automotive vehicle manuals are based upon taking apart and putting together a vehicle. The cover of each manual states: "based on a complete stripdown and rebuild".{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Each section has step-by-step instructions with diagrams and photographs of an actual stripdown or rebuild.

==For professionals==
Manuals for garage professionals include books such as the ''Automotive Diesel Engine Service Guide'', the ''Automotive Air Conditioning TechBook'', ''Citroën and Peugeot Engine Management Systems'', and two ''Engine Management and Fuel Injection Systems Pin Tables and Wiring Diagrams TechBook'' volumes.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Distribution==
Haynes manuals are published in 15 languages: [[English language|English]] (including [[British English|British]], [[American English|American]] and [[Australian English|Australian]] variants), [[French language|French]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[German language|German]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (including [[Spanish in the Americas|American Spanish]] versions), and [[Russian language|Russian]].

==Location==
The company is based in [[Sparkford]], a village near [[Yeovil]] in [[Somerset]], England. The [[Haynes International Motor Museum]], the largest motor museum in the UK, is also in Sparkford and it is home to a large collection of both classic and modern cars, and many rarities.

==Authorship==
Haynes manuals are written by a pair of authors, and take between 20 and 30 man-weeks.&lt;ref name="produce"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.haynes.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10001&amp;productId=17611 | title = How long does it take to produce a Haynes manual? | publisher = Haynes Online | accessdate = 2008-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A car or motorcycle is bought at the beginning of the project and sold at the end.&lt;ref name="rebuild"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.haynes.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10001&amp;productId=17607 | title =  What happens to vehicles after they have been stripped down and rebuilt? | publisher = Haynes Online | accessdate = 2008-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although the workshop phase of the project usually lasts for roughly four weeks,&lt;ref name="produce" /&gt; the vehicle is usually retained for a couple of months to ensure it is functioning correctly.&lt;ref name="rebuild" /&gt;

==Manufacturers==
Haynes generally has the co-operation of the manufacturers to provide technical information such as mechanical tolerances and wiring diagrams. This may seem against their own interests since servicing can cost 40% of the cost of the vehicle over its lifetime, but manufacturers get loyalty by providing customers with information that lets them fix their vehicle, to their ability, or at least diagnose the fault before taking it to a garage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |publisher   = [[Office of Fair Trading]]
 |location    = London
 |url         = http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2004/85-04

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Over the lifetime of a vehicle, the [[aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] is worth perhaps as much as the new cost price of the vehicle, so the manufacturer still gets a significant revenue from the spare parts, and the longer a vehicle lasts, the more so.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

'''''How to Irritate People''''' is a 1968 [[television]] [[broadcast]] written by [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]], [[Marty Feldman]] and [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]]. Cleese, Chapman, and Brooke-Taylor also feature in it, along with future [[Monty Python]] collaborators [[Michael Palin]] and [[Connie Booth]].

In various sketches, Cleese demonstrates exactly what the title suggests—how to irritate people, although this is done in a much more conventional way than the absurdity of similar Monty Python sketches.

== Notable sketches ==

=== Job Interview ===
The "Job Interview" sketch, starring Cleese as the interviewer and Brooke-Taylor as the interviewee, was later performed, almost unchanged, in the first season of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' with Chapman as the interviewee.

===Freedom of speech===

The "Freedom of speech" sketch, starring Cleese as the host/interviewer and Chapman as interviewee Dr. [[Rhomboid]] Goatcabin, features a discussion about [[freedom of speech]] in [[Great Britain]], in which Cleese's character repeatedly reformulates the subject's main question ("Do you believe there is freedom of speech in this country?") in so many ways as to start a [[monologue]] and not let Chapman's character speak. This increasingly annoys the interviewee to the point where he is forced to murder the host in order to express his opinion on the matter, only to be interrupted again by his spirit. This sketch bears some resemblance to [[Anne Elk's Theory on Brontosauruses]] and was originally performed on ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]''.

=== Car Salesman ===
The "Car Salesman" sketch, in which Palin refuses to accept customer Chapman's claim that a car he sold is faulty, later inspired Python's [[Dead Parrot sketch|Dead Parrot]] [[Sketch comedy|sketch]] in which the malfunctioning car is replaced by an expired parrot.

=== Quiz Show ===
The "Quiz Show" sketch, where Brooke-Taylor, as a Pepperpot, annoys Cleese, a [[quiz]] show host, while appearing as a contestant on a show, was later adapted into another Monty Python's Flying Circus sketch, "Take Your Pick" in episode 20, where [[Terry Jones]] plays the contestant attempting to win the prize of a "blow on the head."

=== Airline Pilots ===
The "Airline Pilots" sketch is set in the cockpit of a commercial airliner, with Cleese (as captain) and Chapman (as copilot). The airliner is on autopilot. Bored, they start making reassuring intercom messages to the passengers telling them there is nothing to worry about &amp;ndash; at which point, of course, the passengers get worried &amp;ndash; aided by the flight attendant (Palin). These messages get continually more incomprehensible or mutually contradictory until eventually all the passengers bail out. The Monty Python sketch "Bomb on Plane" in episode 35 alluded briefly to this sketch when pilot Michael Palin told passengers, "Our destination is Glasgow; there is no need to panic."

=== Pepperpots ===
The recurring characters of the "Pepperpots", the old British housewives that exist solely to annoy theater-goers and quiz show hosts, would go on to be a major part of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', appearing in almost every episode of the show.

== Release ==
This film was directed by Ian Fordyce who also directed ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'', and was made in the UK for the American market in an attempt to introduce them to the new style of British humour. For this reason the recording is made to the [[NTSC]] colour standard. The idea for the show came from [[David Frost]].

It appears the show was never broadcast in the UK, but was first broadcast in the United States on 21 January 1969.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Contemporary reviews suggest a broadcast slot of 60 minutes, including commercials, which would make the version broadcast between 50 and 55 minutes, at least 10 minutes shorter than the current video release. In addition, reviews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="How to irritate people"|url=http://sotcaa.org/history/ukonline/python_frame.html?/history/ukonline/python/python_irritate.html|website=SOTCAA|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; refer to David Frost as appearing in the show, whereas he is absent from the video version. An audio track confirms that he originally introduced the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Original introduction for How to irritate people|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnmG89VqJFQ|website=youtube|publisher=The Monty Python Museum|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Palin has also referred to the show being 'tightened up' for the video release.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The show has appeared on [[DVD]], sometimes with "irritating" backward packaging and deliberately faulty navigation - an example of this is the 2002 Sanctuary Visual Entertainment release (Catalogue no. SDF2020); the sleeve has the front image on the back and vice versa - the menu in the disc changes every time an option is selected, and needs to be pressed several times. Originally produced in NTSC, the conversion to [[PAL]] did not give a very good quality of the colours.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1975">The '''Ioachim Chronicle''' (ru: Иоакимовская Летопись), also spelled Joachim or Ioakim) is a chronicle discovered by the Russian historian [[Vasily Tatishchev]] in the 18th century. The chronicle is believed to be a 17th-century compilation of earlier sources describing events in the 10th and 11th centuries concerning the [[Novgorod Republic]] and [[Kievan Rus']].

The original chronicle was lost and the contents are known through Tatishchev's "History of Russia" (История Российская),&lt;ref&gt;V. I. Tatishchev, ''Istoriia Rossiskaia'' (Moscow and Leningrad: AN SSSR, 1962), vol. 1, pp. 107—119.&lt;/ref&gt; although Tatishchev's historiograph is dubious since his later edition of his history or Russia is much more detailed than his earlier edition and is based on sources no longer, and some say never, extant.  Indeed, Tatishchev's sources are so problematic, that Iakov Solomonovich Lur'e wrote of "'Tatishchev information' (data found only in that historian.)"&lt;ref&gt;Ia. S. Lur'e, "The Problem of Source Criticism (With Reference to Medieval Russian Documents)," ''Slavic Review'' Vol. 27, No. 1. (Mar., 1968), pp. 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Be that as it may, Tatishchev concluded that the chronicle was written by [[Joachim the Korsunian]], the first bishop of Novgorod the Great (ca. 988-1030).  More recent studies indicate that the chronicle was more likely compiled by the [[Patriarch Joachim of Moscow]] (d. 1690).&lt;ref&gt;S. K.

The '''Joseph Campbell Foundation''' is a US not-for-profit organization dedicated to preserve, protect and perpetuate the work of influential American mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] (1904–1987). It fosters academic and popular discussion in the fields of [[comparative mythology]] and religion, psychology and culture through its publishing program, events, local groups (Mythological RoundTable&lt;sup&gt;(R)&lt;/sup&gt; groups) and its internet presence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcf.org The Joseph Campbell Foundation Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation was created in 1991 by Campbell's widow, choreographer [[Jean Erdman]], and by his longtime editor [[Robert Walter (editor)|Robert Walter]], who is the foundation's president.&lt;ref&gt;"Setting Up a Foundation of Mythic Proportions," ''The Washington Times,'' December 14, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the initiatives undertaken by the JCF are: 
*''The Collected Works of Joseph Campbell'', a series of books and recordings (both previously released and posthumous) that pulls together Campbell's myriad-minded work&lt;ref&gt;"Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor (Spirituality)," ''National Catholic Register,'' December 7, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="418">The '''''Kallias-Briefen''''' was a collection made by [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] of his thoughts on beauty from his correspondence with his friend [[Christian Gottfried Körner]]. He planned to turn them into a major treatise entitled ''Kallias oder Über die Schönheit'' but in the end did not have time to do so.

'''''Know Your Meme''''' ('''''KYM''''') is a website and video series which uses [[wiki]] software to document various [[Internet memes]] and other online phenomena, such as [[viral video]]s, image macros, catchphrases, [[Internet celebrity|internet celebrities]] and more. It also investigates new and changing memes through research, as it [[Commercialism|commercializes]] on the culture. Originally produced by [[Rocketboom]], the website was acquired in March 2011 by [[Ben Huh#The Cheezburger Network|Cheezburger Network]]. Know Your Meme includes sections for confirmed, submitted, deadpooled (rejected or incompletely documented), researching, and popular memes.

==Website==
The Know Your Meme project started in September 2007, as a recurring segment inside of the Rocketboom video series and a wiki destination site to support the documentation of Internet memes. Created by Kenyatta Cheese, Elspeth Rountree, Jamie Wilkinson and [[Andrew Baron]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://knowyourmeme.com/credits}}&lt;/ref&gt;, "meme experts" in white lab coats used a scientific laboratory metaphor for analyzing and deconstructing the top memes of the day; anyone with an account could use the website to explore and contribute to meme research. At the end of 2008, after more than a year of growth, Rocketboom released an expanded database with [[Jamie Wilkinson]] as the lead developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dembot.com/post/37342219866/the-history-of-know-your-meme |title=The History of Know Your Meme |publisher=Dembot |date=2012-12-06 |accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2017, the database contained more than 2,700 entries of "confirmed" memes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowyourmeme.com/memes |title=Confirmed Entries |publisher=Know Your Meme |date= |accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The administrators have a say on what gets confirmed and what gets "Deadpooled" or rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/deadpool |title=Deadpooled Entries |publisher=Know Your Meme |date= |accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the meme entries are graphic and [[Not Safe For Work]] (NSFW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nsfw |title=NSFW |publisher=Know Your Meme |date=2012-06-17 |accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; NSFW entries have warnings placed along the top of the entry and ads are usually disabled. These warnings may differ from consequences, such as bans. Know Your Meme also has a [[Internet forum|forum]] section, [[blog]], and shop. Dr. Sean Rintel, who wrote ''The Automated Identity'' blog, described Know Your Meme as "lucrative, self-supporting research that blends the humorous and the serious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rintel |first=Sean |url=http://seanrintel.com/2011/09/24/know-your-meme/ |title=Know Your Meme « Sean Rintel |publisher=Seanrintel.com |date=2011-09-24 |accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2016, the site is maintained by five editorial staff members (Brad Kim, Don Caldwell, Adam Downer, Matt Schimkowitz and Briana Milman) and one developer (James Wu) in conjunction with a group of dedicated moderators. Former staff researchers include Chris Menning, Amanda Brennan, Molly Horan and Ari Spool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowyourmeme.com/about |title=About |publisher=Know Your Meme |date= |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Know Your Meme website and web series were acquired in March 2011 by [[Ben Huh#The Cheezburger Network|Cheezburger Network]] for an undisclosed seven-figure amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hustvedt|first=Marc|title=‘Know Your Meme’ Acquired By Cheezburger in Seven-Figure Deal|url=http://news.tubefilter.tv/2011/03/28/know-your-meme-acquired-by-cheezburger-in-seven-figure-deal/|work=Tubefilter News|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episodes==
Episodes of the Know Your Meme show average a few minutes in length each. In a given episode, the KYM staff describe memes and the history behind them. New episodes appear in irregular intervals of time. Breaking meme episodes started in 2010. Separated in seasons, the videos describe the meme using handy images.

[[File:Les sept âges du monde 9047.jpg|thumb|upright|This image from the book depicts Adam and Eve in paradise; In heaven, God, seated on a throne, is surrounded by the choirs of angels and the circles of Creation. The different stages of Genesis are thus embraced in a single panorama, suggesting an instantaneousness of Creation according to the interpretation of [[Philo]] and [[Origen]].]]

'''''Les sept âges du monde''''' (c. 1460) is an [[illustrated manuscript]] on the theme of the [[Seven ages of the world]] from the workshop of [[Jacques Pilavaine]] of [[Mons]], now [[Brussels]] (Bibl. Roy., Ms. 9047).&lt;ref&gt;Marguerite Debae La bibliothèque de Marguérite d'Autriche: essai de reconstitution  1995. Page 124 "La bordure particulière du feuillet 12r est due également à Marmion ou à son assistant. C'est vraisemblablement à Mons, dans l'officine de Pilavaine, que Simon Marmion a illustré Les sept âges du monde. Ce manuscrit a été acquis par les Croy de Chimay à une date indéterminée, toutefois avant 1486. Leurs armes sont peintes "&lt;/ref&gt; It was in the nineteenth century incorrectly attributed to [[Simon Marmion]] of [[Amiens]].&lt;ref&gt;Marc Lachièze-Rey, Jean-Pierre Luminet, Figures du ciel: de l'harmonie des sphères à la conquête spatiale -Bibliothèque nationale de France - 1998 Page 135 "218 Les sept âges du monde Exécuté à Mons vers 1460 dans l'atelier de Jacques Pilavaine, ce codex remarquable est orné d'enluminures attribuées à Simon Marmion d'Amiens (vers 1425-1489), surnommé le » Maître des couleurs ».&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 2010 (cropped).jpg|thumb]]
On May 8, 2006, [[Iran]]ian [[President of Iran|President]] [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] sent a [[Letter (message)|missive]] directly to then [[United States]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] that proposed "new ways" to end the dispute over the [[Islamic republic|Islamic Republic]]'s [[Nuclear program of Iran|development]] of [[nuclear power]].

==2006 missive==
U.S. [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Stephen Hadley]] both reviewed the letter and considered it to be a broad, historic look at the [[Iran–United States relations|U.S.-Iranian relationship]]. It was the first direct contact between the American and Iranian heads of state since April 9, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/05/08/iran.letter/index.html (CNN '' White House: Iran's letter not a nuclear fix'')]&lt;/ref&gt;

During his joint press conference with then-[[United Kingdom]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] at the [[White House]] in May 2006, Bush said,"Well, I read the letter of the President and I thought it was interesting. It was, like, 16 or 17 single-spaced typed pages of -- but he didn't address the issue of whether or not they're going to continue to press for a nuclear weapon. That's the issue at hand."&lt;ref&gt;https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/05/20060525-12.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter achieved more positive [[Mass media|press]] coverage, particularly in non-Iranian [[News media|media]], than President Ahmadinejad had received before. With [[Western world|Western powers]] unable to reach agreement about a [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] resolution on Iran's nuclear program, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said Ahmadinejad's 18-page letter (originally in [[Persian language|Persian]]) promoted the idea that Iran was open to compromise at a time when the rest of the world was divided.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.washingtonpost.com/worldopinionroundup/2006/05/iran_letters_surprising_result_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter, the first written communication between the leaders of the two countries in 27 years, criticized Bush for the invasions of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]], detainee abuse in U.S.-run facilities at [[Cuba]]'s [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|detention center]] and Iraq's [[Abu Ghraib prison]], and his support of [[Israel]]. 

In his letter, Ahmadinejad repeatedly praised [[Jesus]], as well as other figures considered by Muslims to be  prophets. He also referred respectfully twice to [[Moses]]. He stated his belief that one who claims to follow the teachings of Jesus should not be waging war.

Ahmedinejad also questioned whether  Bush could claim to follow Jesus and at the same time invade and occupy countries, kill people, and destroy their homes in the name of democracy.

At one point Ahmadinejad rhetorically asks whether there was infiltration of security services in the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks]] of September 11, 2001, and why aspects have been kept secret (paragraph 28).

The letter received various reactions. "Regardless of the content of Ahmadinejad's letter ... such a communication could lead the two sides to direct talks," the centrist ''[[Shargh]]'' newspaper said somewhat optimistically. "Whatever its content, the letter crosses the red line of non-negotiation. If Ahmadinejad's letter gets a positive response, a new chapter could open and then we could say it is possible to talk and get results in the shadow of war," it said.

The Iranian newspaper ''Siasat-e Rooz'' compared the letter with the historical letter by [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]] to [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in which he suggested conversion to [[Islam]].&lt;!-- commented out this uncited claim: where he predicted the collapse of the communist regime--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mg.co.za/articlepage.aspx?area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__international_news/&amp;articleid=271209 Mail&amp;Guardian. Iran press hails US letter for crossing 'red line'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201009/http://www.mg.co.za/articlepage.aspx?area=%2Fbreaking_news%2Fbreaking_news__international_news%2F&amp;articleid=271209 |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Sun]]'', in their [http://www.nysun.com/article/32594 May 11, 2006 editorial], pointed out that the letter followed the format of an Islamic missionary (''[[Dawah|Da'wa]]'') message, including the traditional ending used by the Islamic prophet  [[Muhammad]] in his Da'wa messages to the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s leaders and the [[nomad]]ic polytheist [[Arab]] tribes. The newspaper translated this phrase ("''Wasalam Ala Man Ataba'al hoda''") as "peace only unto those who follow the true path", and interpreted it as a threat of violence. The phrase is more directly translated as "and peace to whoever follows the path" and is traditional with any Da'wa.&lt;ref&gt;http://gypsyscholarship.blogspot.com/2006/05/history-lesson-vasalam-ala-man-atabaal.html&lt;/ref&gt; The letter also included many references to Jesus as a Muslim prophet, a common [[signature]] of Da'wa letters directed towards [[Christianity|Christians]]. The [[Islamic Republic News Agency]] says President Ahmadinejad confirmed that the letter was intended as a Da'wa invitation in a press conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/line-24/0605110155191821.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902134535/http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/line-24/0605110155191821.htm |archivedate=2006-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mannyng's Chronicle''''' is a [[chronicle]] written in [[Middle English]] by [[Robert Mannyng]] in about 1338. He came from Bourne in Lincolnshire and though not himself in full orders was connected with the priory at Sempringham and later with Sixhill. He also rhymed Story of England.

Mannyng began writing his chronicle at the beginning of Edward III’s reign in 1327 and probably finished it in 1338, dated at the end of the second part. The chronicle consists of two parts. The first, describing British history up to King [[Cadwaldre]] and a translation of [[Wace]]’s [[Roman de Brut]], is 15,946 lines long. The second part, describing history from Cadwaldre up to the death of [[Edward III]] and a translation of the Anglo-French verse by [[Peter of Langtoft]], is 8358 lines long. The chronicle survives in two manuscripts: The P manuscript and the L manuscript. The former is the most complete, since the latter ends somewhere in the middle of part II.

'''Marghanita Laski''' (24 October 1915 &amp;ndash; 6 February 1988) was an English [[journalist]], [[radio]] [[panelist|panellist]] and [[novelist]]; she also wrote [[Biography in literature|literary biography]], plays and short stories.

==Personal life==
Marghanita Laski was born in [[Manchester]], England, to a prominent family of [[Jew]]ish intellectuals ([[Neville Laski]] was her father, [[Moses Gaster]] her grandfather and [[Harold Laski]] her uncle), she was educated at [[Lady Barn House School]] in Manchester and [[St Paul's Girls' School]] in [[Hammersmith]], worked in fashion, then studied English at [[Somerville College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8048395.html|title=MARGHANITA LASKI NOVELIST AND CRITIC; AT 72|date=8 February 1988|publisher=Highbeam|work=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of National Biography]] |title=Laski, Marghanita [formerly Esther Pearl] (1915–1988) |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-39837 |access-date=15 April 2018   |date=3 October 2013 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/39837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst at Oxford she met John Eldred Howard, who was a founder of the [[Cresset Press]]: the couple married in 1937. During this time she worked in journalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1988/Marghanita-Laski-Dies-at-72/id-9b43bdd6498e9ea92ec014d5f3652bb4 AP News Archive, 7 February 1988, "Marghanita Laski dies at 72"], apnewsarchive.com; accessed 14 February 2016.&lt;br&gt;"She is survived by her husband, publisher John [Eldred] Howard, who founded the ''Cresset Press''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dnb /&gt;

Laski lived in [[Hampstead]] and [[Abbots Langley]].&lt;ref name=HastieAV&gt;{{cite book|last=Hastie|first=Scott|title= Abbots Langley&amp;mdash;a Hertfordshire Village|year=1993|publisher= Abbots Langley Parish Council|isbn=0-9520929-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After her son and daughter were born, Laski began writing in earnest; most of her output in the 1940s and 1950s was fiction. She sold the film rights to one novel, ''[[Little_Boy_Lost_(novel)|Little Boy Lost]]'' (1949), about an Englishman on the search for his lost son in the ruins of post-war France to [[John Mills]] — however, when the [[Little Boy Lost (1953 film)|film adaptation]] was released in 1953, she was upset that it had been turned into a musical starring [[Bing Crosby]].&lt;ref name=dnb /&gt; She turned towards non-fiction in the 1960s and 1970s, producing works on [[Charlotte Mary Yonge]], [[Jane Austen]], [[George Eliot]] and [[Rudyard Kipling]].&lt;ref name=dnb /&gt;

An omnivorous reader, from 1958 onward she became a prolific and compulsive contributor to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' and by 1986 had "carded" around 250,000 quotations,&lt;ref name="Brewer_OED_Laski"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oed.hertford.ox.ac.uk/main/content/view/337/359/#Laski|author=Charlotte Brewer|title=Examining the OED|date=22 July 2010|publisher=Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; making her (according to [[Ilan Stavans]]) "the supreme contributor, male or female, to the OED".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Verónica Albin: [http://www.bokorlang.com/journal/32dictionaries.htm On Dictionaries: A Conversation with Ilan Stavans], Translation Journal, Volume 9, No. 2, April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Laski was the science fiction critic for ''[[The Observer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian W. Aldiss]], "Book Review," [[Science Fantasy (magazine)|sfImpulse]], October 1966, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; She was a member of the [[Annan Committee]] on broadcasting between 1974 and 1977. She joined the [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]] in 1979, was elected its Vice Chair in 1982, and served as chair of its Literature Panel between 1980 and 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person.php?LinkID=mp05492|title=Marghanita Laski|accessdate=17 July 2011|publisher=National Portrait Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dnb /&gt;

===Broadcasting===
Laski was a panellist on the popular UK [[BBC]] panel shows ''[[What's My Line#United Kingdom|What's My Line]]?'' (1951–63), ''[[The Brains Trust]]'' (late 1950s), and ''[[Any Questions?]]'' (1960s).&lt;ref name=dnb /&gt;

==Religious views==
An avowed [[atheist]],&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;[http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/ChristineFinn/97 Christine Finn: Chapter Eight] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316200335/http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/ChristineFinn/97 |date=16 March 2007 }} Stanford University&lt;/ref&gt; she was also a keen supporter of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt; Her play, ''The Offshore Island'', is about [[nuclear warfare]].

==Critical reception==
[[Anthony Boucher]] described her novella ''[[The Victorian Chaise Longue]]'' as "an admirably written book, highly skilled in its economic evocation of time, place and character -- and a relentlessly terrifying one."&lt;ref&gt;"Recommended Reading," ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction|F&amp;SF]]'', October 1954, p.95.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ecstasy: A Study of Some Secular and Religious Experiences'' has been compared to ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' by [[William James]] in its importance.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; ''Tory Heaven'', a [[Counterfactual thinking|counterfactual]] novel depicting a Britain ruled by a rigidly hierarchical Conservative dictatorship and satirising middle-class attitudes towards the [[Attlee ministry]], was described as "wickedly amusing" by Ralph Straus of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', and as "an ingeniously contrived and wittily told tale" by Hugh Fausset of the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'': writing about the book in 2018, [[David Kynaston]] called it a "highly engaging, beautifully written novel".&lt;ref name=ns&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2018/04/tory-heaven-forgotten-1948-novel-predicted-conservative-dystopia|title=Tory Heaven: the forgotten 1948 novel that predicted a Conservative dystopia |last=Kynaston |first=David |author-link=David Kynaston|date=14 April 2018 |website=[[New Statesman]]|access-date=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
She died at [[Royal Brompton Hospital]], London due to a smoking-related lung problem on 6 February 1988, aged 72, and was survived by her husband and children.&lt;ref name=dnb /&gt;

'''Mission and Spacecraft Library''' (MSL) is a reference web site, maintained by [[NASA]], containing information about [[satellite]]s. It contains a catalog of several hundreds of [[satellites]] from different countries. The site was founded by [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] employee Mike Evans, who had a vision of building a database that would be publicly accessible via the [[World Wide Web]]. The site has not been updated since 1999.

'''NIST Special Publication 800-37''', "Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems" was developed by the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative Working Group. It aims to transform the traditional [[Certification and Accreditation]] (C&amp;A) process into the six-step [[Risk management framework]] (RMF).

The second step of the RMF is to select the appropriate subset of [[security controls]] from the control catalog in [[NIST Special Publication 800-53]].

'''''On the Origin of the World''''' is a [[Gnostic]] work dealing with [[Creation myth|creation]] and the [[end time]]. It was found among the texts in what is known as the [[Nag Hammadi library]], in [[Nag Hammadi Codex II|Codex II]] and [[Nag Hammadi Codex XIII|Codex XIII]], immediately following the ''[[Hypostasis of the Archons|Reality of the Rulers]]''. There are many parallels between the two texts.&lt;ref name="gb"&gt;''The Gnostic Bible'', ch 27, p431, New Seeds, 2003, {{ISBN|1-59030-199-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript does not have a title, but scholars have dubbed it “On the Origin of the World,” because of what it describes. It is estimated to have been written sometime near the end of the third century. While the author is not mentioned, he or she seems to have been interested in expressing a Gnostic understanding of the world’s conception.&lt;ref name="ls"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ehrman|first1=Bart D.|title=Lost Scriptures : Books That Did Not Make It into the New Testament|date=2003|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-514182-5|page=307|edition=Pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it rethinks the entire story of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], and positions [[Yaldabaoth]] (the Demiurge) as the creator of the world, fulfilling the role of God in Genesis. Furthermore, the [[Serpent (Bible)|Serpent]] in the [[Garden of Eden]] is depicted as a hero sent by [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]], the figure of wisdom, to guide mankind towards enlightenment. It expresses one approach to the creation and end of the world. Other myths found within the Nag Hammadi collection have varying explanations and details.&lt;ref name="ls"/&gt; 

This one has a distinct perspective: it intertwines views from Judaism, Christianity, Hellenistic and Egyptian thought, and others in order to help explain its concept of Gnosticism.&lt;ref name="nhl"&gt;{{cite book|last1=director|first1=James M. Robinson,|title=The Nag Hammadi Library : Chenoposkion Manuscripts English|date=1977|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=New York|isbn=0-06-066929-2|page=161|edition=1st U.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Katherine Hughes, first Provincial Archivist of Alberta.jpg|thumb|right|Katharine Hughes, First Provincial
Archivist. Ca 1906, Provincial Archives of Alberta Photo A539.]]
The origin of the Provincial Archives dates back to 1908 when Katharine Hughes served as the first Provincial Archivist within the Provincial Library. Through the years the holdings continued to grow.

In 1962, the Government of Alberta established a Museums Branch under the Department of the Provincial Secretary for the establishment of a Provincial Archives and a Provincial Museum. The Branch began to accept archival records from government and private sources in 1963. In 1965 work began on a new [[Royal Alberta Museum|Provincial Museum and Archives building]] in the Glenora district of Edmonton. Work finished and the building officially opened in 1967.

As the years went by the Provincial Archives of Alberta outgrew its space and began to warehouse collections, and the need for a larger building became apparent. The Provincial Archives officially opened the doors to its new location at 8555 Roper Road NW in Edmonton on October 5, 2003. The custom 11000 m2 building is situated on a six hectare (14.8 acre) site in southeast Edmonton.

Funding for the construction of the new building was made possible through grants from the  Alberta Centennial Legacies Grant Program

[[File:Joseph Anton Koch 006.jpg|thumb|280px|''Noah's Thanksoffering'' (c.1803) by [[Joseph Anton Koch]]. Noah builds an altar to the Lord after being delivered from the Flood; God sends the rainbow as a sign of his covenant ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 8-9).]]
The [[rainbow]], a natural phenomenon noted for its beauty and mystical appearance, has been a favorite component of [[mythology]] throughout history. Rainbows are part of the myths of many cultures around the world. The [[Norsemen|Norse]] saw it as [[Bifrost]]; [[Judeo-Christian]] traditions see it as a covenant with [[God]] not to destroy the world by means of floodwater. Whether as a bridge to the heavens, messenger, archer’s bow, or [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], the rainbow has been pressed into [[symbol]]ic service for [[millennium|millennia]]. There is a [[myriad]] of beliefs concerning the rainbow. The complex diversity of rainbow myths are far-reaching, as are their inherent similarities.

==Bridges==
[[File:Heimdall an der Himmelsbrücke.jpg|thumb|left|Heimdall before the Rainbow Bridge]]
In Norse religion, a burning rainbow bridge called the [[Bifrost]] connects [[Midgard]] (earth) with Asgard, home of the gods.&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;[http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/rainbow/?ar_a=1#page=4 "Rainbows in Mythology"], National Geographic.&lt;/ref&gt; Bifrost can be used only by gods and those who are killed in battle. It is eventually shattered under the weight of war - the [[Ragnarok]] (German Götterdammerung). The notion that the rainbow bridge to heaven is attainable by only the good or virtuous, such as warriors and royalty, is a theme repeated often in world myths.

In the ancient beliefs of Japan, rainbows were the bridges that human ancestors took to descend to the planet.&lt;ref name=natgeo/&gt;

In [[Navajo people|Navajo]] tradition, the rainbow is the path of the holy spirits, and is frequently depicted in sacred sandpaintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.native-languages.org/legends-rainbow.htm Native American Rainbow Mythology]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Maori tell a tale of Hina, the moon, who caused a rainbow to span the heavens even down to the earth, for her mortal husband to return to earth to end his days, since death may not enter her celestial home.&lt;ref&gt;Best, Elsdon. [http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Bes02Reli-t1-body-d4-d5-d10.html "Rainbow Myths", ''Maori Religion and Mythology''], Part 2, p. 414, P.D. Hasselburg, Wellington, New Zealand, 1982. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Messenger==
In [[Greek mythology]], [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]] is the personification of the rainbow and a messenger linking the gods to humanity. Iris is frequently mentioned as a divine messenger in the [[Iliad]]. She carries a caduceus or winged staff. Iris's messages often concerned war and retribution.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;Lee Jr., Raymond L. and Fraser, Alistair B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=kZcCtT1ZeaEC&amp;q=bridge#v=snippet&amp;q=bridge&amp;f=false ''The Rainbow Bridge: Rainbows in Art, Myth, and Science''], Preface, p. viii, Penn State Press, 2001, {{ISBN|9780271019772}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, like many Greek gods, Iris is continually being redefined.  The rainbow eventually became solely a mode of transportation for Iris, who proves to be as elusive and unpredictable as the rainbow itself.

Anuenue, the rainbow maiden, appears in Hawaiian legends as the messenger for her brothers, the gods Tane and Kanaloa.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Robert D., [https://books.google.com/books?id=LOZuirJWXvUC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;dq=rainbows+in+mythology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xAWgJtuDDb&amp;sig=yxepb7d9kJEp8gBoPDhgiiHCW0g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2d3jU5LBIs-dygSO_YLADQ&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=rainbows%20in%20mythology&amp;f=false ''Handbook of Polynesian Mythology''], p. 174, ABC-CLIO, 2004, {{ISBN|9781576078945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archer's bow==
The rainbow is depicted as an archer's bow in [[Hindu mythology]]. [[Indra]], the god of thunder and war, uses the rainbow to shoot arrows of lightning.&lt;ref name=natgeo/&gt; 

== Sumerian mythology ==
A rather ambiguous perception of the rainbow strikes a vein in all world culture, through its entire storied past.

''[[The Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', who was an ancient [[Sumer]]ian king (ca.3000 BC), is our first detailed written evidence of human civilization. In a Victorian translation of a Gilgamesh variant, [[Leonidas Le Cenci Hamilton]]'s Epic of Ishtar and Izdubar, King Izdubar sees "a mass of colors like the rainbow’s hues" that are "linked to divine sanction for war." Later in the [[Epic poetry|epic]], Izdubar sees the "glistening colors of the rainbow rise" in the [[fountain of life]] next to [[Elam]]’s Tree of Immortality.

The Sumerian farmer god [[Ninurta]] defends [[Sumer]] with a bow and arrow, and wore a crown described as a rainbow.

== Australian aboriginal mythology ==
In Australian Aboriginal mythology, the rainbow snake is the Creator (Kurreah, Andrenjinyi, [[Yingarna]], [[Ngalyod]] and others) in the Dreaming, which is the infinite period of time that "began with the world's creation and that has no end. People, animals, and Eternal Beings like the Rainbow Serpent are all part of the Dreaming, and everyday life is affected by the Dreaming's immortals," in almost every Australian [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigine]] tribe.  In these tribes, of which there are over 50, actual rainbows are gigantic, often malevolent, serpents who inhabit the sky or ground. This snake has different names in different tribes, and has both different and similar traits from tribe to tribe.

The theme consistent with most Australian tribes is that the [[Rainbow Serpent]] is the creator of the world and all beings.  During the [[dry season]], the Rainbow Serpent retreats to deep waterholes.  Another common theme among all aboriginal tribes is that the Rainbow Serpent has no gender.  And while the Rainbow Serpent can give fertility by creating rain, it can also let loose blindness and disease.  "The Aboriginal Rainbow is humanity, because it causes the 'energy' and the 'breath' that gives people life."

Ngalyod, first-born son of [[Yingarna]], who is the Rainbow Serpent creator of the [[Kunwinjku]] in western [[Arnhem]] Land in Australia—sucks up water during the dry season and spits it out as rain during the wet season.  Like Iris, Ngalyod helps to ensure fertility with rains, but he can destroy as well as nurture. Yingarna, the creator of the Kunwinjku people, is "nominally female" and [[androgynous]] like her son Ngalyod. She possesses cunningly ambivalent form; as she combines elements of [[snake]], [[fish]], [[crocodile]], [[catfish]], [[emu]], and [[kangaroo]]. The [[Estonia]]n Rainbow Serpent, like the Aborigines' Ngalyod, sucks up water and spits rain, and also has a confused identity – it possesses an [[ox]]'s head on its serpent body.

== Judeo–Christian faith ==
According to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], after [[Noah]] saved the animals from [[Deluge (mythology)|the Great Flood]], a rainbow appeared.  As the flood had killed all other living beings, the rainbow came to symbolise God's promise that he would never send another flood to destroy all of the earth and that never again would all living things be killed in the waters of a flood.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;

== Other mythologies ==
For some native people the rainbow around the sun is considered to be a sign from God, marking a time of great change. 

“The Whirling Rainbow – Prophecy
There will come a day when people of all races, colors, and creeds will put aside their differences. They will come together in love, joining hands in unification, to heal the Earth and all Her children. They will move over the Earth like a great Whirling Rainbow, bringing peace, understanding and healing everywhere they go. Many creatures thought to be extinct or mythical will resurface at this time; the great trees that perished will return almost overnight. All living things will flourish, drawing sustenance from the breast of our Mother, the Earth.

The great spiritual Teachers who walked the Earth and taught the basics of the truths of the Whirling Rainbow Prophecy will return and walk amongst us once more, sharing their power and understanding with all. We will learn how to see and hear in a sacred manner. Men and women will be equals in the way Creator intended them to be; all children will be safe anywhere they want to go. Elders will be respected and valued for their contributions to life. Their wisdom will be sought out. The whole Human race will be called The People and there will be no more war, sickness or hunger forever” ~Ancient American Indian Prophecy

* For [[Karens]] of Burma, the rainbow is considered as a painted and dangerous demon that eats children.
* [[Izanami]] and [[Izanagi]], the male and female creators of the world in [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]] myth, "descended on the Floating Bridge of Heaven to create land from the ocean of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]." In many texts this bridge is known as a rainbow.

A tradition of closing one's mouth at the sight of a rainbow in order to avoid disease appears to pre-date the Incan empire.
* In pre-[[Islamic]] [[Arabian mythology]], the rainbow is the bow of a weather god, [[Quzah|Quzaḥ]], whose name survives in the Arabic word for rainbow, {{lang|ar|قوس قزح}} ''qaws Quzaḥ'', 'the bow of Quzaḥ'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2081">In '''''S v Chretien''''' an important case in [[South African criminal law]], especially as it pertains to the defence of automatism, the Appellate Division held that even automatism arising out of voluntary intoxication may constitute an absolute defence, leading to a total acquittal, where, ''inter alia'', the accused drinks so much that he lacks criminal capacity.

Seven years later, the legislature intervened to limit the destructive consequences of this decision, enacting section 1(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act,&lt;ref&gt;Act 1 of 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; in "a vain attempt to reflect public sentiment on intoxication." In so doing, however, "the Legislature simply compounded the problems."&lt;ref&gt;Burchell 2012, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modelled on the German penal code, this provision created the special statutory offence of committing a prohibited act while in a state of criminal incapacity induced by the voluntary consumption of alcohol. It requires the prosecution to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused is not liable for a common-law offence because of the lack of capacity resulting from this self-induced intoxication, "so requiring the prosecution to engage in an unfamiliar ''volte face''." As Burchell explains,

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the intoxication, leading to an acquittal of the common-law offence, is only sufficient to impair intention (as on the facts of ''Chretien''), rather than sufficient to impair capacity, then no liability can result under s 1(1), as lack of capacity resulting from intoxication has to be proved for a conviction under s 1(1). The section is in dire need of reform or replacement with a more appropriately worded section.&lt;ref&gt;Burchell 2012, p. 149; his emphasis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Socialist Workers’ Party of Iran''' ({{lang-fa|حزب کارگران سوسیالیست ایران|Ḥezb-e kārgarān-e sūsīālīst-e Irān}}) is a small Iranian [[communist party]] exiled in England.&lt;ref name="RW"&gt;Canada: Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, Iran: Iranian Revolutionary Socialists League and the Iranian Socialist Workers Party (Hezb-e Kargaran Socialist) including number of members, political activities in Iran, publications, reports of ill-treatment by authorities (1996 - June 1999), 1 June 1999, IRN32154.E, available at: http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6ac0114.html [accessed 18 March 2017]
&lt;/ref&gt; The party is a merger of two Trotskyite groups based abroad, "Trotskyites", the first Trotskyite group in the history of Persian communism that was founded by Iranian students in London in 1960s, and another group created in the United States with the help of [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] by [[Babak Zahraei]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2117">'''''Strachan v Prinsloo'''''&lt;ref&gt;1925 TPD 709.&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South African contract law]]. It was heard in the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal Provincial]] Division by Tindall J and Greenberg J.

== Facts ==
An agreement between Strachan and Prinsloo imposed on the former the duty of managing the latter's farm so as to relieve him of all duties of supervision. In spite of warnings, Strachan persistently and continuously failed to attend early in the morning and late in the evening, which was when important duties of supervising had to be done, with the result that those duties had to be performed by Prinsloo. Finally, on three successive days, Strachan did not appear on the farm at all, whereupon Prinsloo cancelled the agreement.

== Judgment ==
The court held

* that, in order to determine whether or not the cancellation was justified, the test to be applied was whether or not Strachan had
failed to perform a vital term, express or implied, of the agreement;
* that an important factor in deciding whether such a term was vital was the question of whether or not Prinsloo would have entered into the agreement in the absence of such term;
* that Strachan had in fact failed to perform a vital term; and
* that Prinsloo was therefore justified in terminating the agreement.

A serious violation of duty by one party, in other words, justifies the other in terminating the contract.

'''''A Letter''''' ('''''Ein Brief'''''), usually known as '''''The Letter of Lord Chandos''''' or the '''''Chandos Letter''''', is a prose work written by [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]] in 1902. It is in the form of a letter dated August 1603 from a writer named Lord Philip Chandos (a fictional character) to [[Francis Bacon]], and describes Chandos's crisis of language.

==Plot summary==
The letter begins with a summary of the great literary feats that Chandos once achieved. Then Chandos writes of his current mental state. He has reached a crisis point in his career concerning [[language]] and its ability to adequately express the human experience. Chandos has abandoned all future written projects, which he once proposed with exuberance, because of his inability to express himself in a meaningful fashion. 
Chandos describes the development of his crisis in stages. First came the loss of the ability to conduct academic discourse on matters of [[morality]] or [[philosophy]]. Next, he lost the function to make everyday conversation regarding opinions or judgments. Lastly he turned to the classics, works by [[Cicero]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], in an attempt to cure his literary ailment but could make no sense of them and his condition continued to decline. Chandos describes his state at present as, “…[having] lost completely the ability to think or speak of anything coherently.”&lt;ref&gt;The Lord Chandos Letter, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; Chandos experiences extreme moments of [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]], where epiphanies on life and the spirit overwhelm him. However, these moments are brief in nature and once they have passed Chandos is incapable of expressing the insight he uncovered moments before. These epiphanies are the highlight of Chandos’ existence, and outside of them his life is stagnant and barren. Chandos often feels he is on the brink of recovery as thoughts begin to form in his mind. But like the epiphanies they are soon lost in his inability to write. This failure of language has robbed him of [[self-confidence]] and [[creativity]]. The end result is Chandos as a broken man mourning his lost abilities. Chandos ultimately says he will write no more in any known language.

==Biographical and Cultural Content==
''The Lord Chandos Letter'' stands in stark contrast to Hofmannsthal's early works and poetry.  He was a poet who had a command over language in his early poetry centered on the “inner self” &lt;ref&gt;Wellberry, David E., ed. ''A New History of German Literature'', Cambridge, MA: The Belknap P of Harvard UP, 2004. 652-658.&lt;/ref&gt; that had characterized his time as a member of the elite literary circle Young Vienna.  Instead, in his writing ''The Lord Chandos Letter'', Hofmannsthal abandons poetry and his work on aesthetics much to the disappointment of his readers.   
''The Lord Chandos Letter'' was written during the [[fin de siècle]], a clash between the old social order and a development of new thought and means of expression.  Central figures of the movement such as Hofmannsthal, [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Ernst Mach]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] witnessed the transformation of society but were dismayed by their inability to effect change in a modern society that was “hopelessly pluralistic; lacking in cohesion or direction”.&lt;ref&gt;Wellberry, David E., (ed.) ''A New History of German Literature'', Cambridge, MA: The Belknap P of Harvard UP, 2004. 652-658.&lt;/ref&gt;
In his letter, Hofmannsthal mentions a sickness of the mind which emerged from the inability of language to sufficiently express oneself amidst social and political turmoil. The preoccupation with a crisis of language is most famously recognized in his ''Lord Chandos Letter''.

Hofmannsthal’s position on the subject of language closely resembled that of Ludwig Wittgenstein who dominated the discussion of the critique of language for nearly a century in Viennese society. Wittgenstein admired Hofmannsthal’s work, especially ''The Lord Chandos Letter'' in which Hofmannsthal anticipated Wittgenstein’s idea that “language is the limit of our world”.&lt;ref&gt;Wellberry, David E., (ed.) ''A New History of German Literature'', Cambridge, MA: The Belknap P of Harvard UP, 2004. 652-658.&lt;/ref&gt; The seemingly incompatible relationship between language and experience is a motif of twentieth century European works and manifested itself in art and music from [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Arnold Schoenberg]] respectively.

==Critical Analysis==
Erwin Kobel is an example of a critic who uses biographical evidence from Hofmannsthal’s life to show the autobiographical links between his life and the Lord Chandos Letter. Thomas Kovach argues that “so many critics viewed ''The Lord Chandos Letter'' as an autobiographical document” because of Hofmannsthal’s personal literary crisis that stemmed from his own self-doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Kobel, Erwin ''Hugo Von Hofmannsthal'', Berlin: De Gruyter, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he continues to argue that while there are apparent autobiographical elements of the work, most critics agree that ''The Lord Chandos Letter'' is in fact a work of fiction. He supports this claim by revealing the anomaly that Hofmannsthal is able to eloquently write about a crisis of language. That this work is fiction is reinforced by the fact that Hofmannsthal had a literary career past the publishing of ''The Lord Chandos Letter'', whereas Lord Chandos promises never to compose again.

Kovach presents another possible interpretation of the work. He writes that the crisis of language should be viewed as deeper than simply a predicament of communication and the limits of language. Since language is used to express thought, he concludes that the crisis examined by Hofmannsthal should be seen as one of cognition in addition to one of language; he asserts that Chandos is unable to write clearly because he is unable to think clearly.&lt;ref&gt;Kovach, Thomas A. (ed.) ''A Companion to the Works of Hofmannsthal'', Rochester, NY: Camden House, 2002. 88-89&lt;/ref&gt;

Another opinion on ''The Lord Chandos Letter'' is that it is evidence of an existential crisis. This existential crisis is related to the reconstruction of fin-de-siècle Vienna and the ensuing crisis felt by society. With the transition to an industrial society, forms and manners of expression previously deemed effective were no longer capable of articulating the thoughts and ideas of Viennese society.

Michael Morton, another critic, views the crisis reflected in ''The Lord Chandos Letter'' as a set of predicaments. He feels Hofmannsthal expresses dilemmas of the self and of language. He argues that Chandos’ crisis is a conflict between viewing the self as a subject or as an object.  The second conflict he sees in the work is a conflict regarding the functionality and usefulness of language. In terms of the utility of language, Morton presents the tension between ideas being built around language rather than vice versa, language attempting to have more power than it is meant to have, and language trying to explain ideas and truths above its capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Kovach, Thomas A.(ed.) ''A Companion to the Works of Hofmannsthal'', Rochester, NY: Camden House, 2002, 91&lt;/ref&gt;
Jacques le Rider analyzes Hofmannsthal’s choice of Francis Bacon as the recipient of the letter. Le Rider recognizes elements of Ernst Mach’s works within ''The Lord Chandos Letter''; Francis Bacon can be identified as the individual who laid the foundation for the work of Ernst Mach. Ernst Mach’s works discusses the elimination of barriers between "inside and outside, the self and the world".&lt;ref&gt;Kovach, Thomas A. (ed.) ''A Companion to the Works of Hofmannsthal'', Rochester, NY: Camden House, 2002, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Le Rider, ''Modernity and crises of identity: culture and society in fin-de-siècle Vienna'' trans.

'''''The Story of the Man Who Turned into a Dog''''' ('''''Historia del hombre que se convirtió en perro''''') is a short play written by [[Osvaldo Dragún]] as part of his ''Historias para ser contadas'' (''Stories to be Told''), a series of short plays.{{r|Woodyard-1971}} It is the third short play in the series.{{r|Gladhart-1993}} The original production premiered  with the independent theatre group Teatro Popular Fray Mocho in 1957.{{r|Schmidt-1976}} ''The Story of the Man Who Turned into a Dog'', as well as the other ''Historias'' can be classified into many genres of theatre, including [[Theatre of the Absurd]], [[Metatheatre]] and [[Magic realism]].{{r|Gladhart-1993|Schmidt-1976}}

== Characters ==
* Actor #1 - The Man
* Actor #2 - portrays characters of the boss and society
* Actor #3 - portrays characters of the boss and society
* Actress - The Wife

== Synopsis ==
Four actors introduce the story by explaining how they learned of the story of the man who turned into a dog, and then explain that they will demonstrate and play this story out for the audience. Actor #1 portrays the Man Who Turned into a Dog, Actors #2 and #3 portray the boss and the people he must work for, and Actress portrays his wife. The Man is in need of a job but is told by Actors 2 and 3 that he can only be given a job if someone else dies, retires or is fired. After a watchman’s dog dies following 25 years of service, the Man reluctantly agrees to become the new watchdog. He must live in the doghouse and eat dog food for the pay of 1 dollar a day, even though it drives him and his wife apart. Gradually, the man assumes dog-like behavior and is consistently denied other job opportunities that open up. After moving out to live in an apartment with other women so she can afford rent, his wife announces that she is pregnant and she is afraid her baby will be born a dog. The Man has an outburst and runs away, fully assuming the role of a dog. By the end of the play, Actor 1 can only bark and is no longer able to shift between man and dog.{{r|Woodyard-1971|Soza|Crew-Leonard-1983}}

== Themes and Dragún's social critique ==
* Anti-[[Capitalism]]{{r|Gladhart-1993}}
* [[Theatre of the Oppressed]]{{r|Gladhart-1993}}
* Dehumanization{{r|Crew-Leonard-1983}}
* The importance of spoken language{{r|Woodyard-1971|Gladhart-1993|Huerta-1977}}&lt;blockquote&gt;The contrast between human speech and the barking required of the man in his job as a watchdog could hardly be more stark, and at the end of the story he has entirely lost the ability to speak. The devaluation of language itself is not overly produced in Dragún's work, for the linguistic patterns remain largely coherent. Nevertheless, the use of language as a mechanism of both deceit and understanding is in keeping with the basic suspiciousness toward language's surface appearance that characterizes the absurd.{{r|Gladhart-1993}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Other prominent themes in Dragún's work and the ''Historias para ser contadas'' series include: "the criticism of censorship, repression and internal exile."{{r|Gladhart-1993|Soza}}

== Writing style ==
Osvaldo Dragún was known for bringing the [[Epic theatre]] of [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] to Latin America, and combining modern Argentine theatre technique with classical themes.{{r|Glickman-Waldman-1996|Cortés-Barrea-Marlys-2003|Rubin}} Much of his work features "narrative foregrounding,"  which "forces the audience to observe the narrative process." {{r|Gladhart-1993}} Characteristics of Dragún's plays that are separate from Brecht include emphasis on the absurd, character underdevelopment and a combination of both narrative and presentational style writing.

''Historias'' was described by Dragún as "studies in the grotesque," and therefore focused heavily on the dehumanization process which he called "''animalizacion."'' {{r|Crew-Leonard-1983}} ''Historia de hombre que se convirtio en perro'' is unique in comparison to the style of the other ''Historia's'' because of its emphasis on the devaluation of language, a common theme in [[Theatre of the Absurd]].{{r|Gladhart-1993}} It also follows the narrative foregrounding technique more than other ''Historias,'' like "''Historia de como nuestro amigo Panchito Gonzalez se sintio responsable de la epidemia de peste bubonica en Africa del Sur,"'' which does not have the actors narrate or recreate the story at all.{{r|Gladhart-1993}}

The characters in ''The Story of the Man Who Turned into a Dog'' play multiple roles and are not fully developed, making the audience focus on the situations of the characters rather than the characters themselves.{{r|Crew-Leonard-1983}}

== Production history ==
* Originated by Teatro Popular Fray Mocho in 1957 as a part of the ''Stories to be Told'' series with an adaptation introducing characters from [[Commedia dell'arte]] written by Osvaldo Dragún himself.{{r|Woodyard-1971|Schmidt-1976}}
* Presented by [[Talento Bilingüe de Houston]], a Chicano theatre company at the 1976 ATA Convention.{{r|Huerta-1977}}
* Presented by Artists and Resources Inc. in 1987.{{r|Anderson-1987}}
* Presented by The Latino Arts Theater in 2006.{{r|Soza}}

== Context ==

=== Osvaldo Dragún ===
Dragún was born on May 7, 1927 in [[Entre Ríos Province]] of [[Argentina]] to a Jewish family. His father was a horse tamer, who lost his job following an economic crash. This event severely impacted the family, forcing the family to move to [[Buenos Aires]] and inspiring Dragún to draw heavy influence from this while writing ''Historia de hombre que se convirtio en perro.''{{r|Soza}} Dragún is also known for his writing for film and television, as a result of his project "Teatro Abierto" that took place during a period of military repression.{{r|Glickman-Waldman-1996}} He died in June 1999 as one of Argentina's prominent playwrights, having won two [[Casa de las Américas Prize]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s for his writing and contribution to the theatre.{{r|Woodyard-1971}}&lt;ref name="Glickman-Waldman-1996" /&gt;

Most of Dragún's plays focus on the life of a lower or middle social class, often criticizing a capitalist society that represses them.{{r|Crew-Leonard-1983}}

=== Argentine Teatro independiente movement ===
Osvaldo Dragún was particularly involved in the Argentine {{illm|Teatro independiente|es}} (independent theatre) movement, a predecessor to [[Argentine Open Theatre]] in the 1980s.{{r|Cortés-Barrea-Marlys-2003|Rubin}} Argentine Teatro independiente began in the 1930s with the establishment of {{illm|Teatro del Pueblo|es}}, founded by the poet {{illm|Leónidas Barletta|es}}. When the movement began, it drew heavy influence from the European [[experimental theatre|avant-garde]] movement, as apparent in Dragún's heavily [[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] writing style. In addition to avant-garde style and technique, the Teatro independiente movement also encouraged the use of the [[Stanislavski's system|'system']] of [[Konstantin Stanislavski]].{{r|Cortés-Barrea-Marlys-2003}}

The goal of Argentine Teatro independiente was to provide a platform to engage with theatre written by the best authors in Argentina. It counteracted the popular commercial and national theaters, and often criticized capitalism and commercialism.{{r|Cortés-Barrea-Marlys-2003}} The values and aesthetic of the movement were incredibly strong because most companies shared designers, playwrights, directors and actors.{{r|Cortés-Barrea-Marlys-2003}} Because of its [[fringe theatre|fringe-like]] values, many of the theatre companies were housed in basements, lofts and other non-conventional spaces.{{r|Rubin}} Of the most prominent independent theatre companies were Teatro del Pueblo, La Mascara, Nuevo Teatro and Fray Mocho, the theatre company where ''Historia del hombre que se convirtió en perro'' premiered.{{r|Woodyard-1971|Cortés-Barrea-Marlys-2003}}

Teatro independiente had great influence on the theatre of its surrounding countries, including [[Peru]], [[Chile]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Uruguay]].{{r|Cortés-Barrea-Marlys-2003}} By 1956, the movement had died out, following the collapse of the [[Juan Perón]] political regime.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4825">'''Ulrich Sinn''' (* 4 October 1945 in [[Bad Bevensen|Bevensen]]) is a German [[Classical archaeology|classical archaeologist]].

Ulrich Sinn graduated from the humanist gymnasium [[Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums|Johanneum]] in [[Lüneburg]]. After completing military service, he first studied education in [[Karlsruhe]] from 1967 to 1968, then [[classical archaeology]], [[Ancient History]] and particularly [[Art history]] at the [[University of Freiburg]]. During this time he took part in excavations in [[Southern Italy]] and [[Greece]] and participated in field trips to [[Athens]] and [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].

Sinn received his doctorate in 1975 with a thesis about ''Die ‚Homerischen’ Becher. Hellenistische Reliefkeramik aus Makedonien'' (The "Homeric" Cup. Hellenistic Ceramic Reliefs of Macedonia), supervised by [[Walter-Herwig Schuchhardt]]. In 1974/5 he held a one-year volontariat at the [[Museums in Kassel|Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen in Kassel]]. In 1975/6 he received a travel grant from the [[German Archaeological Institute]]. From 1976 to 1979 Sinn was Referent at the [[German Archaeological Institute at Athens]], where he participated in the excavations of the [[Heraion of Samos]] among other things. Subsequently, Sinn was Scholarly Assistant at the archaeological institute of the [[University of Bonn]] from 1979 to 1984. In 1982 he was accepted to corresponding membership of the German Archaeological Institute. Since 1985, Sinn has led the international research project, "''Olympia in der römischen Kaiserzeit und der Spätantike''" (Olympia in the Roman Imperial Period and Late Antiquity) through the Olympia excavations of the German Archaeological Institute. As a result, he received teaching positions at various international institutions in Athens. In 1989, Sinn received his [[habilitation]] from the University of Bonn for his work, ''Die griechischen Heiligtümer als Stätten der Hikesie'' (Greek Sanctuaries as Places of ''Hikesia'' (Prayer)). From 1992 until 1994, Sinn was Professor of Classical Archaeology at the [[University of Augsburg]], from 1994 to 2011 he held the Chair of Classical Archaeology at the [[University of Würzburg]]. This involved control of the university's antiquities collection in the [[Martin von Wagner Museum]]. From 2003 to 2009, Sinn was Vice-President of the University of Würzburg.

Sinn's chief research interests are the functions, organisation and topography of Greek sanctuaries, especially Olympia, Greek architectural sculpture, minor arts, vase painting, the history of ancient sports and ancient architecture.

Sinn is married to classical archaeologist [[Friederike Sinn]].

'''World Museum''' is a large [[museum]] in [[Liverpool]], England which has extensive collections covering archaeology, ethnology and the natural and physical sciences. Special attractions include the Natural History Centre and a planetarium. Entry to the museum is free. The museum is part of [[National Museums Liverpool]].

==History==

===History===
[[File:WORLD MUSEUM WILLIAM BROWN STREET LIVERPOOL AUG 2013 (9599097841).jpg|thumb|275px|left|Entrance steps to World Museum with [[Liverpool Central Library]] on the right]]

The museum was originally started as the ''Derby Museum'' as it comprised the [[13th Earl of Derby]]'s [[natural history]] collection. The museum opened originally in 1851, sharing two rooms on ''Duke Street'' with a library. However, the museum proved extremely popular and a new, purpose-built building was required.

Land for the new building on a street then known as ''Shaw's Brow'' opposite [[St. George’s Hall, Liverpool|St. George's Hall]] was donated by local [[Member of Parliament|MP]] and Merchant [[Sir William Brown, 1st Baronet, of Astrop|William Brown]], as was much of the funding for the building which would be known as the [[William Brown Library and Museum]]. Around 400,000 people attended the opening of the new building in 1860.

In the late 19th century, the museum's collection was beginning to outgrow its building so a competition was launched to design a combined extension to the museum and college of technology. The competition was won by William Mountford and the [[College of Technology and Museum Extension]] opened in 1901.

Liverpool, being one of the UK's major ports, was heavily damaged by German bombing during the [[The Blitz|blitz]]. While much of the Museum's collection was moved to less vulnerable locations during the war, the museum building itself was struck by German firebombs and suffered heavy damage. Parts of the museum only began to reopen fifteen years later.

The museum underwent an £35 million refurbishment in 2005 in order to double the size of the display spaces and make even more of the collections accessible for visitors. A central entrance hall and six-storey atrium were created as part of the work. Major new galleries included ''World Cultures'', the ''Bug House'' and the ''Weston Discovery Centre''. On reopening after this refurbishment and extension the museum's name changed from its previous title of Liverpool Museum, which it had held since its establishment at its current [[William Brown Street]] site in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC - Liverpool - Capital of Culture - World Museum Liverpool opens doors|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2005/04/28/capculture_worldmuseum_open_feature.shtml|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astronomy, Space and Time===

The physical sciences collection of World Museum was built after the devastation caused by the incendiary fire of 1941. The collection has expanded, in part, due to transfers from the Decorative Arts Department, Regional History Department, [[Walker Art Gallery]] and the Prescot Museum. The collection also contains several significant collections from the Liverpool Royal Institution, Bidston Observatory, later the Proudman Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, and the Physics Department of the University of Liverpool.

Collections such as these are often made up of items of a singular type designed for a particular experiment such as DELPHI or LEP at [[CERN]] - the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or the Equatorium, a post-Copernican planetary calculator made to special order in the early 17th century. As a consequence the collection is small but contains a number of significant items.

==== Planetarium ====
World Museum is home to a [[planetarium]]. The planetarium opened in 1970 and has 62 seats. It currently attracts about 90,000 people per year. Shows cover various aspects of space science, including the Solar System, space exploration and has special children's shows.

=== Human History ===

==== Archaeology and Egyptology ====
The [[Egyptology]] collection contains approximately 15,000 objects from [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] and is the most important single component of the Antiquities department's collections. The chronological range of the collection spans from the Prehistoric to the Islamic Period with the largest archaeological site collections being [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], [[Amarna]], [[Beni Hasan]], [[Esna]] and [[Meroe]].

Over 5000 Egyptian antiquities were donated to the museum in 1867 by [[Joseph Mayer (antiquary)|Joseph Mayer]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070209032642/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/online/collectors/josephmayer.asp] (1803–1886), a local goldsmith and antiquarian. Mayer purchased collections from Joseph Sams of Darlington (which contained material from the [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]] sale in 1835), Lord Valentia, Bram Hertz and the Reverend Henry Stobart. Mayer had displayed his collection in his own ‘Egyptian Museum’ in Liverpool with a purpose of giving citizens who were unable to visit the British Museum in London some idea of the achievements of the Egyptian civilization. On the strength of this substantial donation other people began to donate Egyptian material to the museum, and by the later years of the 19th century the museum had a substantial collection that [[Amelia Edwards]] described as being the most important collection of Egyptian antiquities in England next to the contents of the [[British Museum]].

The quality of the Mayer donation is high and there are some outstanding items, but with a few exceptions the entire collection is unprovenanced. The collection was systematically enhanced through subscription to excavations in Egypt. Altogether the museum subscribed to 25 excavations carried out by the [[Egypt Exploration Fund]] (now [http://www.ees.ac.uk Egypt Exploration Society]), the British School of Archaeology in Egypt, and the Egyptian Research Account between 1884 and 1914. It was further developed through links with the Institute of Archaeology at [http://www.liv.ac.uk/sace Liverpool University] and important collections came to the museum from the excavations of [[John Garstang]] who was honorary reader in Egyptian archaeology at Liverpool University 1902–07, and Professor of Methods and Practice of Archaeology 1907–41. The museum has always had a close relationship with the university; in the early 1920s [[Percy Newberry]], Brunner Professor of Egyptology, and his successor [[T. Eric Peet]], catalogued the collection, assisted with the rearrangement of the displays, and produced a handbook and guide to the Egyptian collection (1st ed., 1923).

In May 1941, at the height of the [[Liverpool Blitz]], a bomb fell on the museum, which was burnt to a shell. Large parts of the collection had been removed at the outbreak of the war, but much remained on display or in store and many artefacts were destroyed. What remained was quite inaccessible and it was not until 1976 that a permanent Egypt gallery was opened in the rebuilt museum. Following the war the museum actively augmented the collection through collecting of new material from excavations in Egypt and Sudan and the purchase of other museum collections. In 1947 and 1949 the material from Garstang’s excavations at Meroe came to the museum, and in 1955 Liverpool University placed substantial amounts from its own collections within the museum, including many items from Beni Hasan and Abydos. In 1956 the museum purchased almost the entire non-British collections of the [[Norwich Castle Museum]]. This included EES excavated material from Amarna and other sites, botanical remains from [[El-Lahun|Kahun]] and the private collection of Sir [[Henry Rider Haggard]]. In 1973 the collection was increased further by the acquisition of part of the [[Sir Henry Wellcome]] Collection, and by the bequest of Colonel J. R. Danson in 1976, which included more material from Amarna and from Garstang’s excavations at Abydos.

A handy lavishly illustrated guide to the collection is available: ''Gifts of the Nile'' (London: HMSO, 1995).

Following a successful application to the Museums &amp; Galleries Improvement Fund [http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/Museums_galleries/wolfson.htm] of the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport|DCMS]] and the [[Wolfson Foundation]] the museum will be opening a new Egypt gallery in August 2008. The project with a total budget of £600,000 aims to build on the success of the hugely popular World Museum by revitalising the Egyptian gallery, which is now 30 years old.

==== Ethnology ====

The [[ethnology]] collection at World Museum ranks among the top six collections in the country. The four main areas represented are: Africa, the Americas, Oceania and Asia. The exhibition includes [[interactive]] displays.

=== Natural History ===

==== Biology and Zoology ====
In the Natural World area can be seen a range of exhibits, including live colonies of insects and historic [[zoological]] and [[botanical]] exhibits.

The 13th Earl of Derby founded the original museum with a major donation of zoological specimens in 1851, including many rare and '[[Type (biology)|type]]' specimens, the ones that act as standards for the species. There also specimens of several extinct species housed in the museum, including the [[Liverpool pigeon]], the [[great auk]] (and an egg), the [[Falkland Islands wolf]], the [[South Island piopio]], the [[Lord Howe swamphen]], the [[dodo]], the [[long-tailed hopping mouse]], and the [[thylacine]]. Another attraction in the Natural world area is an art gallery with pictures of natural artist [[Edward Lear]].

The museum’s collections have grown considerably since then and now also include important botanical specimens dating back over 200 years, which represent most of Britain and Ireland’s native flora. Visitors can examine the collections up close in the award-winning Clore Natural History Centre, where there are interactive displays.

==== Geology ====
The geological collection at World Museum contains over 40,000 fossils as well as extensive rock and mineral collections. Each of these exhibits show information about the origins, structure and history of the planet earth.

Founded in 1858, only seven years after the museum's establishment, much of the original collection was destroyed during the Second World War. The post-war collections have expanded considerably, thanks in part to the acquisition of several significant museum and university collections.

The largest of these was the [[University of Liverpool]]'s geological collection that includes some 6,600 [[fossil]] specimens. The collection covers the following areas: [[palaeontology]], [[rocks]] and
[[minerals]].
