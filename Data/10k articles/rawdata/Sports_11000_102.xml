'''Chaudhary Bansi Lal Cricket Stadium''' is a cricket ground off State Highway 16 in [[Lahli]], [[Haryana]]. The Stadium can accommodate only 8,000 spectators and came to prominence  when [[Sachin Tendulkar]] played his last Ranji match in October 2013.

The pitch remains lively as the water-level is unusually high in Lahli. At places water is found only two to four foot below the ground, and that helps in keeping the pitch and outfield green.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/all-set-for-the-deity/article5273398.ece thehindu]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Umesh Yadav]] returned a five-wicket haul to skittle out Haryana for a mere 55 in the first innings, and bagged two more in the second to ensure an eight-wicket win. The venue made its first-class debut in with a Haryana-Andhra game.

The highest team total has been 500/9 declared by Haryana against Jharkhand in November 2008. And there have been seven instances of teams getting all out inside 100 runs. In all, 27 centuries have been scored at this venue, the highest individual score being [[Yusuf Pathan]]'s 195 for Baroda against Haryana in 2010-11.

'''Clyde''' was the official mascot of the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Glasgow]]. Clyde is an anthropomorphic [[thistle]] (the [[floral emblem]] of [[Scotland]]) and is named after the [[River Clyde]] which flows through the centre of [[Glasgow]]. The mascot was designed by Beth Gilmour from Cumbernauld, who won a competition run by Glasgow 2014 for children to design the Mascot. Beth's drawing was then brought to life by digital agency [http://www.nerv.co.uk Nerv], who turned it into a commercial character, created a full backstory, gave it a name&amp;nbsp;– Clyde&amp;nbsp;– and created a website for him. Clyde was finally revealed in a seven-minute animated film created by [http://www.nerv.co.uk Nerv] at a ceremony at [[BBC Scotland]]'s headquarters in [[Glasgow]]. The organiser, Glasgow 2014, said the mascot's design was chosen, because of its "Scottish symbolism and Glaswegian charm and likeability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thistle man Clyde is Glasgow Commonwealth Games mascot |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-19651062 |work=BBC News Glasgow and West Scotland |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) |date=20 September 2012 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statues==
[[File:Clyde in the Bus Station.jpg|thumbnail|right|Clyde in the [[Buchanan Bus Station]]]]
25 life-size Clyde statues were erected at places of public interest across the city including the [[Glasgow Botanic Gardens]], the [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery]] and at [[George Square]]. However following vandalism at a statue in the [[Govan]] area of the city, the statues were taken down. They are expected to be re-erected in secure areas.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-28694261&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial==
By the final day of the Games, over 50,000 Clyde mascot [[cuddly toy]]s had been sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Commonwealth Games - special because they're unique |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/commonwealth-games/28632068 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) |date=3 August 2014 |accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible Glasgow Mascot==
Due to popularity in the city, the Clyde mascots are currently proposed official mascots of the [[City of Glasgow]].{{cn|date=October 2017}}{{update|date=October 2017}}

===Ajax===
While registered as part of the clubs' B1 selection (under-17 team), he made his professional debut in the Dutch [[Eerste Divisie]] on 22 October 2013, playing for the reserves team [[Jong Ajax]] as a 69th-minute substitute for [[Derwin Martina]], in a 5–1 away loss against [[VVV-Venlo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VVV vs. Jong Ajax|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2013/10/21/netherlands/eerste-divisie/vvv-venlo/jong-ajax/1478774/|publisher=Soccerway|accessdate=13 August 2014|date=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season saw Dankerlui registered with the A1 selection (under-19 team), where he made his continental debut at youth level in the [[UEFA Youth League]] on 21 October 2014, in a 2–2 draw against [[FC Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Damil Dankerlui - UEFA Profile|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefayouthleague/season=2015/clubs/player=250064842/index.html|publisher=[[UEFA]].com|accessdate=22 October 2014|date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite appearing on the bench for the first team of Ajax, he was never substituted on, plying his trade for the reserves team before leaving the club in January 2018.

'''Dhanmondi Cricket Academy''' is a [[Bangladesh]]i [[cricket]] team who play in the [[Dhaka]] Metropolis Second Division Cricket League. The club has been a professional cricket club since promotion from Dhaka Metropolis Third Division Cricket League in 2006-2007.

Hafez Muhammad Zakaria is the president of the club, which is managed by Toyob Afzal and coached by Sadiquzzaman Pintu. Its home ground is the [[Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium]] in [[Dhanmondi|Dhanmondi Road #4]].
 
The club was formed by residents of Dhanmondi.

==History==
===1990s===
Since the late 1980s, the children’s park located in [[Dhanmondi]] Road 4 was in the grasp of drug dealers, sex workers, hijackers, etc. and as time wore on, the situation got worse. There was a time in the early and mid-1990s when the local residents were afraid to venture towards that park even during broad daylight after several incidents of hijacking and murder.
A slum developed and sex workers were usually seen residing in the park. The seesaws, slides and swings provided by [[Dhaka City Corporation]] became so rusted and inoperative that it was hard to find a single child in the park. Drugs were sold so rampantly, the parents of the area were scared even if their children were passing by the children’s park at that time.

===Early days===
The locals realised that the children’s park would be lost and after taking permission from the local Ward Commissioner, the seesaws, swings, etc. were removed and some keen cricketers started practicing. Soon, DCA (a registered academy recognised both by the Government of [[Bangladesh]] and [[Bangladesh Cricket Board]]) was developed. In a roundtable meeting of The Daily Star few years ago, speakers lauded the efforts of this community. In 2002, the daily’s senior reporter [[Morshed Ali Khan]] praised DCA on its work during a cricket tournament at the park in its sports page.

The '''Stadium''' at [[Xalapa]], [[Veracruz]], ("Estadio Xalapeño") is located a few blocks south and downhill of the center of town, and can be easily seen from the terraces of [[Parque Juárez (Xalapa)|Parque Juárez]].

The place was identified in the 1920s by [[William K. Boone]], then president of the local [[Chamber of Commerce]], as a natural stadium similar to those of the classical stadiums and theaters of [[Ancient Greece]].

The site had been a mosquito-infested marshland known as the "Ciénega de Melgarejo" that was drained and filled under the direction of the Chamber of Commerce, with manpower provided by the [[Jalapa Railroad &amp; Power Co. (JRR&amp;PC)|Jalapa Railroad and Power Company (JRR&amp;PC)]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ddoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA584&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+%2B+Boone+%2B+Jalapa&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1#PPA584,M1 Article published by Popular Mechanics in Abril 1923]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stadium Jalapeño (1922) ==

The '''Stadium Jalapeño''' was inaugurated with athletic games on 
May 5–7, 1922.

On Sunday May 7, 1922, as part of the weekend festivities, the famous pilot [[Frank Hawks]] landed within the Stadium grounds.

== Estadio Xalapeño (1925) ==
[[Image:91's 1000v.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Estadio in 1991]]
A few years later, the monumental stadium was built under the architectural and engineering direction of Modesto C. Rolland (Baja California Sur, 1881).  It was inaugurated on September 20, 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revistazonadeocio.com/search/label/04 Revista Zona de Ocio Número 04 -in Spanish]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was given the name of the revolutionary general [[Heriberto Jara Corona]], governor of the state of Veracruz at the time.

'''FC Rànger's''' is an [[Andorra]]n [[Association football|football]] club based in [[Andorra la Vella]]. The team currently plays in [[Segona Divisió]].

== History ==
The club was founded in 1981, but they only started playing in Andorran leagues in 1999. After two years in the [[Segona Divisió|Andorran Second Division]], they played for the first time in the [[Primera Divisió|Campionat de Lliga]] in the 2001–02 season. After the promotion, FC Rànger's started a growing career, and after finishing second in 2005, they won the league title the two subsequent years, 2006 and 2007.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

FC Rànger's made their first time appearance in European competitions, playing the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] in the summer of 2005, being eliminated by [[SK Sturm Graz|Sturm Graz]] by 6–1 in aggregate. The home match ended with a 1–1 draw, scored by Norberto Urbani. After winning the Andorran championship, they qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], where they were eliminated in the First round by [[FK Sarajevo]]. FC Rànger's became the first Andorran team to compete in the [[UEFA Champions League]] by qualifying for the [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League|2007–08]] season. However, their stay was short-lived as they were eliminated in the first qualifying round after a 5–0 aggregate loss to [[FC Sheriff Tiraspol|Sheriff Tiraspol]] over two rounds played on 17 July and 25 July 2007.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

At the end of the [[2008-09 Primera Divisió|2008–09 season]] the team was relegated. After two seasons in [[Segona Divisió]] the team finished second in the 2010–11 season and was promoted (promotion-ineligible [[Lusitanos B]] finished champion). In the 2011–12 season FC Ranger's finished 8th in [[Primera Divisió]] being relegated again to [[Segona Divisió]] where it has remained since then.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1785">In [[gambling]] and [[economics]], the '''favourite-longshot bias''' is an observed phenomenon where on average, bettors tend to overvalue "long shots" and undervalue favourites. That is, in a horse race where one horse is given [[odds]] of 2-to-1, and another 100-to-1, the true odds might for example be 1.5-to-1 and 300-to-1 respectively. Betting on the "long shot" is therefore a much worse proposition than betting on the favourite. In the long run, losing 5% by betting on the favourite, but losing 40% on longshots is not uncommon. Various theories exist to explain why people willingly bet on such losing propositions, such as [[risk-loving]] behavior, risk-averse behavior&lt;ref name="shadsy1"&gt;"We discount the chances of any party at 100/1 or bigger. The reverse of tweak 1 applies here. Almost all of these probably have effectively zero chance. Why don’t we just make them a bigger price? We don’t think we’ll take much extra money, certainly not enough to compensate us for the day we get it wrong." Matthew Shadwick, Ladbrokes, 2010-02-25. See [http://www2.politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2010/02/25/the-ladbrokes-election-forecast/ Ladbrokes Election Forecast Feb 25th 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; or simply inaccurate estimation as presented by Sobel and Raines.&lt;ref&gt;Russell S.

[[File:HS First XI 1907.JPG|thumb|[[Hale School]] First XI (plus schoolmaster) in 1907]]

The '''first XI''', '''first 11''' or '''starting XI''' are the 11 primary players in an organisation's leading team, particularly a [[cricket]] team or [[association football]] team. A player who is considered part of the starting XI is often the most proficient in his/her particular position - for example, a football club's leading goal scorer will almost always be selected due to his ability and the contribution he/she makes to the team.

'First eleven' is a reference to the fact that they are the first eleven players selected to play for the team - many sports state that clubs must have squads of no fewer than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; number of players, and this number is often higher than 11. For example, in the [[Premier League]], each club has to designate a squad of 25.

The '''Gazelle Stakes''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Thoroughbred horse race]] raced annually at [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] in [[Ozone Park, New York]]. Open to three-year-old [[Filly|fillies]], it is a [[Graded stakes race|Grade II]] event run over a distance of one and one-eighth miles on dirt. The race is sometimes a stepping stone to the [[Breeders' Cup Distaff]].

Inaugurated in 1887, the first [[New York (state)|New York]]-bred winner of an [[Eclipse Award]], [[Saratoga Dew]], won this race in 1992.  That year she was [[American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly]].

The Gazelle was run at [[Gravesend Race Track]] from 1887 to 1916, at [[Belmont Park]] from 1969 through 2008, and at Aqueduct Racetrack from 1917 to 1955, in 1960, from 1962 to 1968, and since 2009. It was not run from 1911 to 1916, nor from 1933 to 1935.  Originally set at a mile and sixteenth from 1900 to 1958, it was set at one mile in 1959 and 1960. From 1917 through 1920, it was open to fillies three-years-old and up.

The Gazelle Stakes was run in two divisions in 1959 and 1960.

{{refimprove|date=October 2012}}
{{Bowling techniques sidebar |expanded=all}}
In [[cricket]], a '''googly''' is a type of deceptive [[delivery (cricket)|delivery]] bowled by a right-arm [[leg spin]] [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]]. In [[Australia]], it is occasionally referred to as a '''Bosie''' (or '''Bosey'''), an [[eponym]] in honour of its inventor [[Bernard Bosanquet (cricketer)|Bernard Bosanquet]]. A leg spin bowler bowls in a leg spin way but it goes in the off side direction.

== Explanation ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
While a normal [[leg break]] spins from the leg to the [[Fielding (cricket)#Off and leg side fields|off side]], away from a right-handed [[batsman]], a googly spins the other way, from off to leg, into a right-handed batsman (and is distinct from an [[off break]] delivery). The bowler achieves this change of spin by bending the wrist sharply from the normal leg break delivery position. When the [[Cricket ball|ball]] rolls out of the hand (from the side near the [[little finger]], as in a normal leg break), it emerges with clockwise spin (from the bowler's point of view). A googly may also be achieved by bowling the ball as a conventional leg break, but spinning the ball further with the fingers just before it is released.

The change of wrist action can be seen by a skilled batsman and the change of spin allowed for when playing a shot at the ball. Less skilled batsmen, or ones who have lost their concentration, can be deceived completely, expecting the ball to move one direction off the [[Cricket pitch|pitch]], only for it to move the other direction. If the batsman is expecting a leg break, he will play outside the [[line and length|line]] of the ball after it spins. This means the ball can either strike the pads for a potential [[Leg before wicket|lbw]] appeal, or may fly between the bat and the pads and hit the [[wicket]], or catch the edge of the bat.

The googly is a major weapon in the arsenal of a leg spin bowler, and can be one of the bowler's most effective most important wicket-taking balls. It is used infrequently, because its effectiveness comes mostly from its surprise value.

[[Left-arm unorthodox spin]]ners, commonly known as "chinaman" bowlers, can bowl with the googly action using the left arm.  This delivery is usually known as a chinaman googly and turns away from a right-handed batsman, like a leg break or [[left-arm orthodox spin]]ner. The googly is similar in principle to the [[doosra]], the ball from an [[off-spin]]ner which turns the opposite way from his stock ball.

[[Chambers Dictionary]] describes the whole of etymology of the word as "dubious".

== Mechanics ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
To grip the ball for a leg-spinning delivery, the ball is placed into the palm with the seam parallel to the palm. The first two fingers then spread and grip the ball, and the third and fourth fingers close together and rest against the side of the ball. The first bend of the third finger should grasp the seam. The thumb resting against the side is up to the bowler, but should impart no pressure. When the ball is bowled, the third finger will apply most of the spin. The wrist is cocked as it comes down by the hip, and the wrist moves sharply from right to left as the ball is released, adding more spin. The ball is tossed up to provide [[Cricket terminology#F|flight]]. The batsman will see the back of the hand when the ball is released.

==In popular culture==
In a scene from [[John Boorman]]’s 1987 film ''[[Hope_and_Glory_(film)|Hope and Glory]]'', [[David Hayman]] plays a father who, before leaving to fight in [[World_War_II|WWII]], passes on ‘the secret of the googly’ to his young son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/hopeandglory.html|title=Hope and Glory|publisher=John Boorman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harrah's Philadelphia Casino &amp; Racetrack''' is a [[racino]] on the [[Chester, Pennsylvania]] [[dock (maritime)|waterfront]].

The track's first [[harness racing]] season opened on September 10, 2006. [[Wagering]] on live horse races is currently available on-track from April to December on Sunday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. The racing broadcast is also available for wagering via [[simulcast]] from other racetracks throughout the United States and Canada. The {{convert|5/8|mi|km}} racetrack has a limestone-based surface. The midpoint of {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} races comes on a bridge that hangs over the [[Delaware River]] and provides a view of freight ships passing by. The racing paddock at Harrah's holds up to 131 horses. Because of limited space, horses are shipped in to the paddock rather than stabled on-track.

Built on the site of the former [[Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co.|Sun Shipbuilding]] campus, the casino consists of 2,900 [[slot machine]]s, {{convert|100000|sqft|m2}} of gaming space, and a {{convert|14000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} event center. It began offering live table games on July 18, 2010.

On September 27, 2006, the [[Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board]] gave Harrah's Chester its slots license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bohlin|first1=Liam|title=Pa approves conditional slots licenses|url=https://topcasinogames.net/pa-approves-first-gaming-licenses|website= Top Casino Games|publisher=Liam Bohlin|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board]] approved Harrah's application for the permanent slot-machine gaming operator license on December 20, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bohlin|first1=Liam|title=Pa approves permanent gaming operator licenses|url=https://topcasinogames.net/pa-approves-permanent-gaming-licenses/|website=Top Casino Games|publisher=Liam Bohlin|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[racino]] opened on January 22, 2007, one day earlier than anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.delcotimes.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=17737692&amp;BRD=1675&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=18171&amp;rfi=6{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Catania Engineering Associates performed the site design for this project.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Live Harness Racing==
Harrah's Philadelphia currently runs a 150 day live meet that runs from early April to mid-December. Race days are typically operated on Sunday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, as well as occasional holidays that fall on Saturday and Monday. Racing at Harrah's is usually scheduled to begin at 12:40PM.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.caesars.com/content/dam/ccr/Racing/Revised2016-Harrah's%20Philadelphia%20Live%20Calendar(Post%20Times).pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The track is {{convert|5/8|mi|km}} in length and has a limestone-based surface. Although the track is equipped with lights, it has not operated a schedule with regular night racing since 2011.

Harrah's Philadelphia was the host site of [[PA Harness Week]], a weekly show aired on Philadelphia's local [[Comcast SportsNet]] channel. It aired its final episode on August 29, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://harnessweek.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The show was drawing roughly 3,500 viewers per week at the time of its cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.harnessracingupdate.com/2015/10/02/high-costs-and-low-ratings-led-to-cancellation-of-pa-harness-week/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Concept2 Indoor Rowers.JPG|thumb|Several Concept 2 Model C indoor rowers]]
An '''indoor rower''', or '''rowing machine''', is a machine used to simulate the action of [[watercraft rowing]] for the purpose of exercise or training for [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]]. Indoor rowing has become established as a sport in its own right. The term also refers to a participant in this sport.

Modern indoor rowers are often known as '''ergometer'''s (colloquially '''erg''' or '''ergo'''), an ergometer being a device which measures the amount of [[mechanical work|work]] performed. The indoor rower is calibrated to measure the amount of energy the rower is using through their use of the equipment.

==History==
 
[[Chabrias]], an Athenian admiral of the 4th century BC, introduced the first rowing machines as supplemental military training devices. "To train inexperienced oarsmen, Chabrias built wooden rowing frames on shore where beginners could learn technique and timing before they went on board ship." &lt;ref&gt;John R. Hale, ''"Lords of the Sea: The Epic Story of the Athenian Navy and the Birth of Democracy"''&lt;/ref&gt;

Early rowing machines are known to have existed from the mid-1800s, a US patent being issued to W.B. Curtis in 1872 for a particular hydraulic based damper design. Machines using linear pneumatic resistance were common around 1900—one of the most popular was the Narragansett hydraulic rower, manufactured in Rhode Island from around 1900–1960.&lt;ref name=rowingnews&gt;{{citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=M0sEAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = The Independent Rowing News | date = 22 February 2002 | accessdate = 3 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However they did not simulate actual rowing very accurately nor measure power output.

In the 1950s and 1960s, coaches in many countries began using specially made rowing machines for training and improved [[Power (physics)|power]] measurement. One original design incorporated a large, heavy, solid iron flywheel with a mechanical friction [[brake]], developed by John Harrison of Leichhardt Rowing Club in Sydney, later to become a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of New South Wales. Harrison, a dual Australian champion beach sprinter who went on to row in the [[coxless four]] at the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Melbourne Olympics]], had been introduced to rowing after a chance meeting with one of the fathers of modern athletic physiological training and testing, and the coach of the Leichhardt ''Guinea Pigs'', Professor [[Frank Cotton]]. Professor Cotton had produced a rudimentary friction-based machine for evaluating potential rowers by exhausting them, without any pretence of accurately measuring power output. Harrison realised the importance of using a small braking area with a non-absorbent braking material, combined with a large flywheel. The advantage of this design (produced by Ted Curtain Engineering, Curtain being a fellow Guinea Pig) was the virtual elimination of factors able to interfere with accurate results—for instance ambient humidity or temperature. The Harrison-Cotton machine represents the very first piece of equipment able to accurately quantify human power output; power calculation within an accuracy range as achieved by his machine of less than 1% remains an impressive result today. The friction brake was adjusted according to a rower's weight to give an accurate appraisal of boat-moving ability (drag on a boat is proportional to weight). Inferior copies of Harrison's machine were produced in several countries utilising a smaller flywheel and leather straps—unfortunately the leather straps were sensitive to humidity, and the relatively large braking area made results far less accurate than Harrison's machine. The weight correction factor tended to make them unpopular among rowers of the time. Harrison, arguably the father of modern athletic power evaluation, died in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldrowing.com/index.php?pageid=44|title=The Official World Rowing Web Site - Rowing / Ergometer/Indoor|first=WebSide Associates|last=SA|website=wayback.archive.org|accessdate=15 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110031520/http://www.worldrowing.com/index.php?pageid=44|archivedate=10 November 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gjessing rowing ergometer.jpg|thumb|left|Gjessing-Nilson rowing ergometer, showing helical pulley and flywheel]]
In the 1970s, the Gjessing-Nilson ergometer from [[Norway]] used a friction brake mechanism with industrial strapping applied over the broad rim of the flywheel. Weights hanging from the strap ensured that an adjustable and predictable friction could be calculated. The cord from the handle mechanism ran over a helical pulley with varying radius, thereby adjusting the gearing and speed of the handle in a similar way to the changing mechanical gearing of the oar through the stroke, derived from changes in oar angle and other factors. This machine was for many years the internationally accepted standard for measurement.

The first [[air resistance]] ergometers were introduced around 1980 by [[Repco]].

In 1981, Peter and Richard Dreissigacker, and Jonathan Williams, filed for U.S. patent protection, as joint inventors of a "Stationary Rowing Unit". The patent was granted in 1983 (US4396188A). The first commercial embodiment of the [[Concept2]] "rowing ergometer" (as it came to be known) was the Model A, a fixed-frame sliding-seat design using a bicycle wheel with fins attached for air resistance. The Model B, introduced in 1986, introduced a solid cast flywheel (now enclosed by a cage) and the first digital performance monitor, which proved revolutionary. This machine's capability of accurate calibration combined with easy transportability spawned the sport of competitive indoor rowing, and revolutionised training and selection procedures for watercraft rowing. Later models were the C (1993) and D (2003). &lt;ref name=rowingnews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rowinghistory.net/Equipment.htm|title=RowHist-Equipment|website=www.rowinghistory.net|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Casper Rekers, a Dutch engineer, was granted a U.S. patent for a "Dynamically Balanced Rowing Simulator" (US5382210A). This device differed from the prior art in that the flywheel and footrests are fixed to a carriage, the carriage being free to slide fore and aft on a rail or rails integral to the frame. The seat is also free to slide fore and aft on a rail or rails integral to the frame. From the patent Abstract: "During exercise, the independent seat and energy dissipating unit move apart and then together in a co-ordinated manner as a function of the stroke cycle of the oarsman.".  "RowPerfect" and "Oartec" are two companies which currently manufacture commercial embodiments of the Rekers device.

==Design summary==

All rowing-machine designs consist of an energy damper or braking mechanism connected to a chain, strap, belt and/or handle. Footrests are attached to the same mounting as the energy damper. Most include a rail which either the seat or the mechanism slide upon. Different machines have a variety of layouts and damping mechanisms, each of which have certain advantages and disadvantages.

Currently available ergometer (flywheel-type) rowing machines use a spring or elastic cord to take up the pull chain/strap and return the handle. Advances in elastic cord and spring technology have contributed to the longevity and reliability of this strategy, but it still has disadvantages. With time and usage, an elastic element loses its strength and elasticity. Occasionally it will require adjustment, and eventually it will no longer take up the chain with sufficient vigour, and will need to be replaced. The resilience of an elastic cord is also directly proportional to temperature. In an unheated space in a cold climate, an elastic cord equipped rowing ergometer is unusable because the chain take-up is too sluggish. Thus, as the result of several factors, the force required to stretch the elastic cord is a variable, not a constant. This is of little consequence if the exercise device is used for general fitness, but it is an unacknowledged problem, the "dirty little secret", of indoor rowing competitions. The electronic monitor only measures the user input to the flywheel. It does not measure the energy expenditure to stretch the elastic cord. A claim of a "level playing field" cannot be made when a resistance variable exists (that of the elastic cord) which is not measured or monitored in any way (see more on this in "Competitions" section).

In the patent record, means are disclosed whereby the chain/cable take-up and handle return are accomplished without the use of a spring or elastic cord, thereby avoiding the stated disadvantages and defects of this broadly used method. One example is the Gjessing-Nilson device described above. Partially discernable in the thumbnail photo, it utilizes a cable wrapped around a helical pulley on the flywheel shaft, the ends of this cable being connected to opposite ends of a long pole to which a handle is fixed. The obvious disadvantage of this system is the forward space requirement to accommodate the extension of the handle pole at the "catch" portion of the stroke. The advantage is that, except for small transmission losses, all of the user's energy output is imparted to the flywheel, where it can be accurately measured, not split between the flywheel and an elastic cord of variable, unmeasured resistance. If a similar system were installed on all rowing ergometers used in indoor rowing competitions, consistency between machines would be guaranteed because the variability factor of elastic cord resistance would be eliminated, and this would therefore ensure that the monitor displayed actual user energy input. 

In a 1988 US patent (US4772013A), Elliot Tarlow discloses another non-elastic chain/cable take-up and handle return strategy. Described and depicted is a continuous chain/cable loop that passes around the flywheel sprocket and around and between fixed pulleys and sprockets positioned fore and aft on the device. The handle is secured in the middle of the exposed upper horizontal section of the chain/cable loop. Although somewhat lacking in aesthetics, the Tarlow device does eliminate the stated disadvantages and defects of the ubiquitous elastic cord handle return. Tarlow further argues that the disclosed method provides an improved replication of rowing because in actual rowing the rower is not assisted by the contraction of a spring or elastic cord during the "recovery" portion of the stroke. The rower must push the oar handle forward against wind and oarlock resistance in preparation for the next stroke. Tarlow asserts that the invention replicates that resistance.

A third non-elastic handle return strategy is disclosed in US patent, "Gravity Return Rowing Exercise Device" (US9878200 B2, 2018) granted to Robert Edmondson. As stated in the patent document, the utilization of gravity (ie: a weight) to take up the chain and return the handle eliminates the inevitable variability of handle return force associated with an elastic cord system and thereby ensures consistency between machines.

Machines with a digital display calculate the user's power by measuring the speed of the flywheel during the stroke and then recording the rate at which it decelerates during the recovery. Using this and the known [[moment of inertia]] of the flywheel, the computer is able to calculate speed, power, distance and energy usage. Some ergometers can be connected to a personal computer using software, and data on individual exercise sessions can be collected and analysed. In addition, some software packages allows users to connect multiple ergometers either directly or over the internet for virtual races and workouts.

===Motion type===

At the current state of the art, indoor rowers which utilize flywheel resistance can be categorized into two motion types. In both types, the rowing movement of the user causes the footrests and the seat to move further and closer apart in co-ordination with the user's stroke. The difference between the two types is in the movement, or absence of movement, of the footrests relative to ground.

The first type is characterized by the Dreissigacker/Williams device (referenced above). With this type the flywheel and footrests are fixed to a stationary frame, and the seat is free to slide fore and aft on a rail or rails integral to the stationary frame. Therefore, during use, the seat moves relative to the footrests and also relative to ground, while the flywheel and footrests remain stationary relative to ground. This type is sometimes referred to as a "stationary" or "fixed head" rowing ergometer.

The second type is characterized by the Rekers device (referenced above). With this type, both the seat and the footrests are free to slide fore and aft on a rail or rails integral to a stationary frame. Therefore, during use, the seat and the footrests move relative to each other, and both also move relative to ground. This type is often referred to as a "dynamic" rowing ergometer, although "dynamically balanced" would be a more accurate description. A static indoor rower of the Dreissigacker/Williams type, if mounted on wheels or slides to enable forward and rearward movement of the unit, is by definition "dynamically balanced". The accessory slide tracks correspond to the referenced stationary frame of the Rekers device. Casper Rekers is nevertheless credited as the first to utilize this motion type in a rowing ergometer. The effect, for the user, is a more realistic "on the water" sensation than that provided by a "stationary" rowing ergometer because the "dynamically balanced" type more closely replicates actual rowing wherein the seat and the boat move relative to each other, and both move relative to the water.

Included within the "dynamically balanced" category are indoor rowers in which the footrests and flywheel are fixed to a moveable carriage, and also those in which the footrests alone are fixed to the moveable carriage, the carriage in both cases being free to slide fore and aft on a rail or rails integral to the stationary frame. The described device in which the flywheel is fixed to and moves with the carriage and footrests (the Rekers design) is sometimes referred to as a "floating head" rowing ergometer.

Indoor rowers which utilize a pivoting handle or handles to simulate a sweep or sculling stroke (thus referred to as "rowing simulators"), can be of the above described "stationary" or "dynamically balanced" type of rowing ergometer. The Coffey rowing machine, designed by Olympic silver medalist rower, Calvin Coffey, can be configured to enable a sweep or a sculling stroke, in either a "stationary" or "dynamically balanced" mode. The flywheel is positioned horizontally at the rear of the device, under the seat rails (US patents: US4743011A 1988; US7862484B1; Inventor: Calvin Coffey). 

The Rekers rowing ergometer (referenced above) is described in the title of the patent document as "dynamically balanced", rather than simply "dynamic", as is common among users. "Dynamically balanced" is the accurate description, for the following reason:  During the drive portion of the stroke, since the sliding carriage to which the footrests are attached, and the sliding seat, can both move independently fore and aft on a rail or rails, therefore the straightening of the user's legs causes the footrests to slide forward, and simultaneously causes the seat to slide rearward. However, since the combined mass of the seat and user is considerably greater than the combined mass of the footrests and sliding carriage (and flywheel, if it is part of the sliding footrests assembly), therefore the rearward movement of the seat and user, relative to ground, is much less than the forward movement of the footrests and carriage assembly, relative to ground. During the recovery portion of the stroke, this difference in mass has the same effect. The sliding footrests carriage, and the sliding seat carrying the user move proportionately the same distances relative to ground as during the drive as they return to their starting positions. Thus, during use, the combined mass of the footrest and sliding carriage, and the combined mass of the user and sliding seat, move towards and away from each other, as they oscillate about their common centre of gravity. To ensure the linked movement of these two masses remain centred on the device, the rail or rails upon which they slide are sloped upward slightly at their front and rear ends. Alternatively, elastic cords or springs attached to the seat and footrests can ensure such centering. 

In addition to the aforementioned improved "on the water" sensation experienced by the user of a "dynamically balanced" rowing ergometer, there are also bio-mechanical and power delivery advantages. Bio-mechanically, throughout all phases of the stroke, the user's mass moves only a small distance relative to ground, therefore the user is not subject to the inertial stresses associated with the abrupt fore and aft directional changes experienced on a "stationary" rowing ergometer. With respect to power delivery: Casper Rekers, inventor of the "dynamically balanced" rowing ergometer, "performed tests comparing the indicated power output of a "stationary" versus a "dynamic" rowing ergometer - the subject gained 10-20% power output in the second case, representing additional power that could be applied to the flywheel instead of accelerating the bodyweight" of the user on the seat rail.&lt;ref&gt;"The Physics of Ergometers" Anu Dudhia, Dept. of Physics, University of Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

===Damper type===

'''Piston resistance''' comes from hydraulic cylinders that are attached to the handles of the rowing machine.&lt;ref name= "guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rowingmachine-guide.com/types.html|title=Rowing Machine Resistance Types|website=Rowing Machine Reviews 2017|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of the rower handles on this class of rower is typically adjustable, however, during the row the handle length is fixed which in turn fixes the trajectory that the hands must take on the stroke and return, thus making the stroke less accurate than is possible on the other types of resistance models where it is possible to emulate the difference in hand height on the stroke and return. Furthermore, many models in this class have a fixed seat position that eliminates the leg drive which is the foundation of competitive on water rowing technique. Because of the compact size of the pistons and mechanical simplicity of design, these models are typically not as large or as expensive as the others types.

'''Braked flywheel resistance''' models comprise magnetic, air and water resistance rowers. These machines are mechanically similar since all three types use a handle connected to a flywheel by rope, chain, or strap to provide resistance to the user&amp;nbsp;– the types differ only in braking mechanism. Because the handle is attached to the resistance source by rope or similarly flexible media, the trajectory of the hands in the vertical plane is free making it possible for the rower to emulate the hand height difference between the stroke and the return. Most of these models have the characteristic sliding seat typical of competitive on-the-water boats.

:'''Magnetic resistance''' models control resistance by means of permanent magnets or electromagnets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/321644-air-vs-magnetic-rowing-machine/|title=Air Vs. Magnetic Rowing Machine|first=Heather M. J.|last=Emerson|publisher=|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "guide"/&gt; A rotary plate, made of non-magnetic, electrical conducting material such as aluminum or copper, and either integral with, or independent of the flywheel, cuts through the magnetic field of the permanent magnet or the electromagnet, resulting in induced eddy currents which generate a retarding force that opposes the motion of the rotary plate. Resistance is adjusted with the permanent magnet system by changing the position of the permanent magnet relative to the rotary plate. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US6328677B1/en|title=Simulated-kayak, upper-body aerobic exercise machine &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; 1991 US Patent 5076573A "Magnetic Resistance Type Stationary Rowing Unit" &lt;/ref&gt; Resistance is adjusted with the electromagnetic system by varying the strength of the electromagnetic field through which the rotary plate moves. &lt;ref&gt; 1995 US Patent 5656001A "Eddy Current Trainer..." &lt;/ref&gt; The magnetic braking system is quieter than the other braked flywheel types and energy can be accurately measured on this type of rower. The drawback of this type of resistance mechanism is that the resistance is constant for any given setting. Rowers using air or water resistance more accurately simulate actual rowing, where the resistance increases the harder the handle is pulled. Some rowing machines incorporate both air and magnetic resistance.

:'''Air resistance''' models use vanes on the flywheel to provide the flywheel braking needed to generate resistance.&lt;ref name= "guide"/&gt; As the flywheel is spun faster, the air resistance increases. An adjustable vent can be used to control the volume of air moved by the vanes of the rotating flywheel, therefore a larger vent opening results in a higher resistance, and a smaller vent opening results in a lower resistance. The energy dissipated can be accurately calculated given the known [[moment of inertia]] of the flywheel and a tachometer to measure the deceleration of the flywheel. Air resistance rowing machines are most often used by sport rowers (particularly during the off season and inclement weather) and competitive indoor rowers. RowPerfect, Oartec, and Concept 2, are three manufacturers of this type of rowing machine.

:'''Water resistance''' models consist of a paddle revolving in an enclosed tank of water.&lt;ref name= "guide"/&gt; The mass and drag of the moving water creates the resistance. Proponents claim that this approach results in a more realistic action than possible with air or magnetic type machines. "WaterRower" was the first company to manufacturer this type of rowing machine. The company was formed in the 1980's by John Duke, a US National Team rower, and inventor of the device (1989 US Patent US4884800A). At that time, in the patent record, there were a few prior art fluid resistance rowing machines, but they lacked the simplicity and elegance of the Duke design. From the 1989 patent Abstract: "... rowing machine features a hollow container that holds a supply of water. Pulling on a drive cord during a pulling segment of a stroke rotates a paddle or like mechanism within the container to provide a momentum effect."

:'''Rheological fluid resistance''': In the patent record various exercise devices, including rowing machines, are depicted and described utilizing flywheels in which rotational resistance is controlled by varying the viscosity of a magnetically or electrically reactive fluid (magnetorheological or electrorheological fluid). It seems probable therefore that at some time commercially available rowing machines will include those with flywheels containing variable viscosity fluid.

Rowing machines with monitors calculate performance using an algorithm unique to the individual manufacturer; it will be affected by the type of resistance used and other factors.

==Exercise==

Indoor rowing primarily works the cardiovascular systems with typical workouts consisting of steady pieces of 20–40 minutes, although the standard trial distance for record attempts is 2000 m, which can take from five and a half minutes (best elite rowers) to nine minutes or more. Like other forms of cardio focused exercise, [[interval training]] is also commonly used in indoor rowing. While cardio-focused, rowing also stresses many muscle groups throughout the body anaerobically, thus rowing is often referred to as a [[strength training|strength-endurance sport]].

Unlike high impact exercises, which can damage knees and the connective tissues of the lower body, rowing's most common injury site is the lower back. Proper technique is a necessity for staying injury free, with a focus on both mechanics and breathing, as correct rhythm, exhaling on the drive and inhaling on the recovery, is a stabilizing force for the upper body. Non-rowers commonly overemphasize the muscles of the upper body, while correct technique uses the large muscle of the thighs to drive much of the stroke. Also, good technique requires that the angle of the upper body is never too far forward, nor too far back, both of which jeopardize the lower back and compression injuries on the knees and hip flexor muscles. Proper technique however, can only be achieved if the design of the exercise equipment enables proper technique. The ubiquitous rigid, single-piece handle does not follow the natural movement of a user's hands, wrists, and forearms as the stroke progresses. It does not ensure or enable the bio-mechanically correct alignment of the hands, wrists, and forearms with the direction of the applied force. Typically, the user finishes the stroke with the wrists in an angulated position. It is incorrect to criticize this as "bad technique", when the equipment itself is the cause. Through no fault of their own, regular users of indoor rowers equipped with the standard single-piece handle, are prone to repetitive strain injury and chronic wrist pain (see more on this in "Rowing Technique" section, below).

In addition to the high levels of fitness attained, rowing is an intense calorie-burning exercise. The late Dr. Fritz Hagerman, Professor of biomedical science and a leading researcher in rowing physiology, determined that "...you burn more calories in rowing than any other activity. Cross-country skiing comes closest. At standard submaximal levels of exercise, rowing will burn calories at a rate 10-12% higher than running, and 15-20% higher than cycling." &lt;ref&gt;Interview in Concept 2 newsletter, Fall 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Although rowers with less ability and training will burn fewer calories, the ergometer is an excellent tool for use in a weight-loss program.

The standard measurement of speed on an ergometer is generally known as the "split", or the amount of time in minutes and seconds required to travel {{convert|500|m}} at the current pace&amp;nbsp;— a split of 2:00 represents a speed of two minutes per 500 metres, or about {{convert|4.17|m/s|km/h|abbr=on}}. The split does not necessarily correspond to how many strokes the rower takes (the "rating") since strokes can vary in power.

==Ergometer testing==
Ergometer tests are used by rowing coaches to evaluate rowers and is part of athlete selection for many senior and junior national rowing teams. During a test, rowers will row a set distance and try to clock the fastest time possible, or a set time and try to row the longest distance possible. The most common distances for erg tests are 1000, 2000, 5000, 6000 or 10000 metres. The most common times for erg tests are 3 min, 5 min, 20 min, 30 min, and 1 hour.

==Rowing technique==
Rowing technique on the erg broadly follows the same pattern as that of a [[Anatomy of a rowing stroke|normal rowing stroke]] on water, but with minor modifications: it is not necessary to "tap down" at the finish, since there are no blades to extract from water; but many who also row on water do this anyway. Also, the rigid, single-piece handle enables neither a sweep nor a sculling stroke. The oar handle during a sweep stroke follows a long arc, while the oar handles during a sculling stroke follow two arcs. The standard handle does neither. But regardless of this, to reduce the chance of injury, an exercise machine should enable a bio-mechanically correct movement of the user. The handle is the interface between the human and the machine, and should adapt to the natural movement of the user, not the user to the machine, as is now the case. During competitions an exaggerated finish is often used, whereby the hands are pulled further up the chest than would be possible on the water, resulting in a steep angulation of the wrists - but even with a normal stroke, stop-action images show wrist angulation at the finish, evidence that the standard rigid, single-piece handle does not allow the user to maintain a bio-mechanically correct alignment of hands, wrists, and forearms in the direction of applied force. On the Concept 2 website "Forum", many regular users of the indoor rower have complained of chronic wrist pain. Some have rigged handgrips with flexible straps to enable their hands, wrists, and forearms to maintain proper alignment, and thereby reduce the possibility of repetitive strain injury. Rowing machine manufacturers have ignored this problem.

Rowing on an ergometer requires four basics phases to complete one stroke; the catch, the drive, the finish and the recovery. The catch is the initial part of the stroke. The drive is where the power from the rower is generated while the finish is the final part of the stroke. Then, the recovery is the initial phase to begin taking a new stroke. The phases repeat until a time duration or a distance is completed.

===Catch===
Knees are bent with the shins in a vertical position. The back should be roughly parallel to the thigh without hyperflexion (leaning forward too far). The arms and shoulders should be extended forward and relaxed. The arms should be level.

===Drive===
The drive is initiated by the extension of the legs; the body remains in the catch posture at this point of the drive. As the legs continue to full extension, the rower engages the [[core (anatomy)|core]] to begin the motion of the body levering backward, adding to the work of the legs. When the legs are flat, the rower begins to pull the handle toward the chest with their arms while keeping their arms straight and parallel to the floor.

===Finish (or release)===
The legs are at full extension and flat. The shoulders are slightly behind the pelvis, and the arms are in full contraction with the elbows bent and hands against the chest below the nipples. The back of the rower is still maintained in an upright posture and wrists should be flat.

===Recovery===
The recovery is a slow slide back to the initial part of the stroke, it gives the rower time to recover from the previous stroke. During the recovery the actions are in reverse order of the drive. The arms are fully extended so that they are straight. The torso is engaged to move forward back over the pelvis. Weight transfers from the back of the seat to the front of the seat at this time. When the hands come over the knees, the legs contract back towards the foot stretcher. Slowly the back becomes more parallel to the thighs until the recovery becomes the catch.

==Competitions==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2018}}
The first indoor rowing competition "was held in Cambridge, MA in February 1982 with participation of 96 on-water rowers" who called themselves the "Charles River Association of Sculling Has-Beens" &lt;ref&gt;Concept 2 promotional booklet, year 2000&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus the acronym, "CRASH-B". A large number of indoor rowing competitions are now held worldwide, including the indoor rowing world championships (still known as [[CRASH-B Sprints]]) held in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], United States in February and the [[British Indoor Rowing Championships]] held in [[Birmingham]], England in November, or in more recent years the [[Lee Valley VeloPark]] London in December; both are rowed on Concept2s. The core event for most competitions is the individual 2000-m; less common are the mile (e.g., Evesham), the 2500-m (e.g., Basingstoke—also the original distance of the CRASH-B Sprints). Many competitions also include a sprint event (100m-500m) and sometimes team relay events. 

Most competitions are organized into categories based on sex, age, and weight class. While the fastest times are generally achieved by rowers between 20 and 40 years old, teenagers and rowers over 90 are common at competitions. There is a nexus between performance on-water and performance on the ergometer, with open events at the World Championships often being dominated by elite on-water rowers. Former men's Olympic single scull champions [[Pertti Karppinen]] and [[Rob Waddell]] and five-time Gold Medalist [[Steve Redgrave|Sir Steven Redgrave]] have all won world championships or set world records in indoor rowing.

In addition to live venue competitions, many erg racers compete by internet, either offline by posting scores to challenges, or live online races facilitated by computer connection. Online Challenges sponsored by [[Concept2]] include the annual ultra-rowing challenge, the [[Virtual Team Challenge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://log.concept2.com/log_challenges.asp|title = Online Challenges|date = |accessdate = February 6, 2015|website = Concept2|publisher = Concept2|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding comparability of results between machines: As stated, the above indoor rowing competitions use the Concept 2 rowing ergometer, currently the Model D, which like previous models, is equipped with an electronic performance monitor that compensates for differences in resistance adjustment (1989 US Patent US4875674A; Assignee: Concept 2). Therefore it is widely accepted that a result on one machine can be fairly compared with a result on another machine regardless of their respective resistance settings. The assumed consistency between machines would be correct if another, unmeasured resistance variable did not exist. This is the variability of the resistance of the elastic cord used to take up the chain and return the handle. The electronic performance monitor only measures the energy expended to spin the flywheel. It does this via small magnets embedded in the face of the flywheel which pass a sensor connected to the performance monitor (see patent US4875674A referenced above). The monitor does not measure the energy required to stretch the elastic cord, therefore unless the force required to stretch the elastic cord is a guaranteed constant, there is no guarantee that the performance monitor will display the actual total energy expended by the user.

Factors which affect the force required to stretch the elastic cord are: the tension of the cord, the amount of usage of the machine, ambient temperature. Typically, the elastic cord is factory adjusted to approximately seven pounds of return force. On the Concept 2 website "Forum" much anecdotal evidence has been posted of new machines feeling "heavier" than used machines, that more effort is required to achieve the same monitored result on a new machine than on one that has been worn-in. This is understandable. Any elastic element loses elastic strength with time and usage.

Variability between machines is of small importance if one machine is used consistently for fitness and training, such as in a home gym. It will still provide a sufficiently reliable measure of one's progress. In a competition setting however, equivalence between machines is essential. An example will clarify: Consider the entirely reasonable possibility that the elastic cord of one machine requires 7 pounds of force to stretch, and the elastic cord of another machine requires 6 1/2 pounds of force to stretch. Now suppose that two competitors, one on each of these machines, complete a 2000M race in 8 minutes at an average stroke rate of 30 strokes per minute. The competitor on the machine with the elastic cord tensioned to 7 pounds will need to pull with 1/2 pound more force for the duration of each stroke than the other competitor in order to obtain the same monitored results (since, as explained, only the energy expended to spin the flywheel is measured, not the energy to stretch the elastic cord). If each stroke averages 5 feet in length, and it takes 240 strokes (8X30) to complete the race, the extra work done by the one competitor is equivalent to lifting a 1/2 pound weight through a vertical distance of 1200 feet (5X240), or put another way, the extra work required by this competitor is equivalent to lifting a 10 pound weight through a vertical distance of 60 feet. However, in this example, despite the difference in energy output by the competitors, the monitor displays are the same.

While true that indoor rowing competitions use only new machines in an effort to ensure all elastic cord tensions are identical, this cannot be confirmed because tensions are never measured or adjusted at these competitions. Further, since ambient temperature affects cord elasticity, the results of races in different locations with different ambient temperatures are not comparable. Fairness is particularly problematic with on-line racing in which new machines and worn-in machines with elastic cords of differing strengths and tension can be used by competitors.

The '''Johan Cruyff Arena''' ({{lang-nl|Johan Cruijff Arena}} {{IPA-nl|ˈjoːɦɑn ˈkrœyf aːˌreːnaː|}}; officially stylised as ''Johan Cruijff ArenA'') is the main stadium of the Dutch capital city of [[Amsterdam]]. Built from 1993 to 1996 at a cost equivalent to €140&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name="factsfigures" /&gt; it is the largest stadium in the country. The stadium was previously known as the '''Amsterdam Arena''' (stylised as ''Amsterdam ArenA'') until the 2018–19 football season, when the stadium was officially renamed in honour of legendary Dutch footballer [[Johan Cruyff]] after he passed away in March 2016.&lt;ref name="johan-cruijff-arena-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="johan-cruijff-arena-2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="johan-cruijff-arena-3" /&gt;

The stadium is the home of the [[association football]] club [[AFC Ajax]] since 1996. In addition, it was the home of the now-defunct American football club [[Amsterdam Admirals]] (1997–2007). It was one of the stadiums used during [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]], and also held the [[1998 UEFA Champions League Final|1998 Champions League]] and [[2013 UEFA Europa League Final|2013 Europa League]] finals. The stadium will also host three group stage matches and one match in the round of 16 of the [[UEFA Euro 2020|Euro 2020]].

Both international and Dutch artists have given concerts in the stadium, including [[Coldplay]], [[Take That]], [[Celine Dion]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[André Hazes]], [[David Bowie]], [[AC/DC]], [[One Direction]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Beyoncé]] and [[Rihanna]]. The dance event [[Sensation (event)|Sensation]] was held in the stadium every year, up until the final edition in 2017.

The stadium has a [[retractable roof]] combined with a grass surface. It has a [[seating capacity|capacity]] of 54,990 people during football matches,&lt;ref name="spreekbeurt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.johancruijffarena.nl/Stadion-omgeving/Spreekbeurt.htm|title=Houd je spreekbeurt over de Johan Cruijff ArenA|website=Johan Cruijff ArenA|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of 68,000 people during concerts if a centre-stage setup is used (the stage in the middle of the pitch); for end-stage concerts, the capacity is 50,000, and for concerts for which the stage is located in the east side of the stadium, the capacity is 35,000. It held UEFA five-star stadium status, which was superseded by a new system of classification.

==History==
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=left|image1=Amsterdam Arena Roof Open.jpg|image2=Amsterdam Arena Roof Closed.jpg|width=200|caption2=The Johan Cruyff Arena with the [[retractable roof]] opened and closed}}

Amsterdam was one of six cities that bid to host the [[1992 Summer Olympics]]. In 1986, a new Olympic stadium was designed, with a football field and an athletics track. It was to be built in the area of Strandvliet in [[Amsterdam Zuidoost]]. After Amsterdam lost the bid to [[Barcelona]] in October 1986, the plans for the new stadium were abandoned. In 1987, the Stichting Amsterdam Sportstad (English: "Amsterdam Sports City Foundation") was established, which made new plans for a sports stadium with an all-seated capacity of 55,000. In 1990, a new design was made based on both previous designs, with a football field, an athletics track, and completely covered by a roof. By this time, [[AFC Ajax]] needed a new stadium, as their old stadium, [[De Meer Stadion|De Meer]], was far too small for most of Ajax's games. For several years, Ajax had moved its more important games to [[Olympisch Stadion (Amsterdam)|Olympisch Stadion]].&lt;ref name="themakingof"&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.amsterdamarena.nl/filestore/?dl=258 The making of Amsterdam ArenA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130052349/http://www.amsterdamarena.nl/filestore/?dl=258 |date=30 January 2009 }} Amsterdam ArenA. Retrieved 8 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Once more, the design was altered – the athletics track was removed, the capacity was reduced to 50,000 seats, and the fixed roof was replaced by a [[retractable roof]]. In 1992, the [[Government of Amsterdam]] authorised the plans for the stadium with a ''Transferium'' where people could transfer from their car to various forms of public transportation. In 1993, the Government of Amsterdam changed the development plan of the location and gave a permit to build the stadium.&lt;ref name="themakingof"/&gt;

The first pile of the [[deep foundation]] of the stadium was placed on 26 November 1993. The construction work, undertaken by [[Ballast Nedam]] and [[Royal BAM Group]],&lt;ref name="themakingof"/&gt; took almost three years. The highest point of the building was reached on 24 February 1995, after the roof construction was raised. The fly-over from the public road to the parking facilities was opened on 13 March 1996. The stadium received 180,000 visitors during the construction work, until the stadium was closed from 1 July 1996 until the opening ceremony.&lt;ref name="themakingof"/&gt; The stadium was officially opened on 14 August 1996 by [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]].&lt;ref name=Wist&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.amsterdamarena.nl/over_amsterdam_arena/wist_je_dat/ Wist je dat...]. Amsterdam ArenA. Retrieved 8 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]] opened the stadium by making a curtain fall inside the stadium. This revealed the world's largest painting ''De Zee'' (English: ''The Sea'') of {{convert|80|×|126|m}}. Two-dimensional ships were placed on the sea representing the clubs in the ''[[Eredivisie]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} [[Tina Turner]] opened the stadium with three concerts with 160,000 people in the arena, from her world breaking [[Wildest Dreams Tour]]. [[Trijntje Oosterhuis]] sang the [[hymn]] "De Zee", composed for the opening ceremony by [[John Ewbank (composer)|John Ewbank]]. An eight-day [[Olympic torch relay|torch relay]] with 375 runners over 1400 kilometres through the Netherlands reached the stadium. The first runner was [[Johan Cruyff]] starting in the old stadium De Meer, and the last runner was [[Frank Rijkaard]] arriving in the new stadium. After the grass was revealed and the roof opened, an inaugural football match was played between AFC Ajax and [[A.C. Milan|Milan]].

The construction of the stadium cost €140&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="factsfigures"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amsterdamarena.nl/docs/pdf_facts_figures.pdf |title=Facts &amp; figures |accessdate=9 June 2008 |language=Dutch |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407084136/http://www.amsterdamarena.nl/docs/pdf_facts_figures.pdf |archivedate=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium combines a retractable roof with a grass surface. This caused some problems in the beginning: the grass rolls would not grow in the shade of the open roof and had to be replaced up to four times a year.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Exterior renovation===
In September 2015, plans were presented to renovate the stadium's facade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amsterdamarena.nl/article-tonen-op-pagina/amsterdam-arena-presenteert-nieuwbouwplannen-2020.htm |title=Amsterdam ArenA presenteert nieuwbouwplannen 2020 |language=Dutch |date=30 September 2015 |publisher=Amsterdam Arena}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renovation should provide better quality and service to visitors by widening the walkway rings around the stadium, creating more room for the visitors and for new facilities (the number of seats remains the same). As a result, the outside of the stadium transforms from a concave shape to a convex shape, drastically altering its appearance. The renovation is planned to be completed in 2020, when 4 matches of the [[UEFA Euro 2020]] championship will be played in the Arena.

Construction works started in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/verbouwing-johan-cruijff-arena-is-van-start~a4503005/ |title=Verbouwing Johan Cruijff Arena is van start |language=Dutch |date=27 June 2017 |publisher=Het Parool}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first phase is to renovate the east side of the stadium, where construction of the new facade was completed in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amsterdamarena.nl/article-tonen-op-pagina/ruwbouw-oostzijde-amsterdam-arena-klaar.htm |title=Ruwbouw oostzijde Amsterdam ArenA klaar |language=Dutch |date=5 April 2018 |publisher=Amsterdam Arena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name change===

'''Majors Stadium''' was a baseball field in [[Greenville, TX]] but was originally used as a football field. In the beginning, the field was called Phillips Field but was later altered to allow baseball to be played.&lt;ref&gt;http://huntcohc.org/marker1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phillips Field==
Before Majors Stadium became a baseball diamond, it was used in the early years by local high school football teams. On October 4, 1929, [[Oak Cliff High School|Dallas Oak Cliff]] and [[Greenville Independent School District|Greenville High School]] played the first contest at the venue.

The field was transformed for the '''Greenville Majors''' after their first year of existence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Greenville%2C_TX&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, the football stands were removed and the stands were rebuilt to accommodate [[baseball]].

===Visit by the Yankees===
The [[New York Yankees]] played the Greenville Majors on April 10, 1949, in an exhibition game. The Majors won the game, 4-3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brad |last=Kellar |newspaper=[[Herald-Banner]] |location=[[Greenville, TX]] |title=At the old ball game |url=http://www.heraldbanner.com/local/x2015922716/At-the-old-ball-game |date=April 10, 2013 |accessdate=April 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Aasen |publisher=[[KERA-TV]] |title=65 Years Ago Today, The New York Yankees Played In Greenville – And The Home Team Won |location=[[Dallas, TX]] |url=http://keranews.org/post/65-years-ago-today-new-york-yankees-played-greenville-and-home-team-won |date=April 10, 2014 |accessdate=April 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remnants==
The only parts left are the arched entryway and a fieldhouse where the field used to exist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ballparkreviews.com/gvilletx/gvilletx.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://shroom.aminus3.com/image/2009-03-17.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''McMorran Arena''' is an entertainment complex in [[Port Huron, Michigan]] consisting of a 4,800-seat multi-purpose arena and a theater. It was designed by [[Alden B. Dow]] and built in 1960 for $3.5 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|3.5|1960|r=0}} million today).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcmorran.com/arena.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211083244/http://www.mcmorran.com/arena.htm |archivedate=2008-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sports ==
As of the 2015-2016 season, McMorran will be the home of the [[Port Huron Prowlers]] of the [[Federal Hockey League]].  Previous hockey tenants include the [[Port Huron Flags]] (various incarnations), [[Port Huron Wings]], [[Port Huron Border Cats]], [[Port Huron Beacons]], [[Port Huron Icehawks]] and [[Port Huron Fighting Falcons]].  In addition, the arena has also been home to three prior indoor football teams; the [[Port Huron Pirates]], [[Port Huron Predators]] and [[Port Huron Patriots]].

== Arena ==
The arena seats 3,400 for [[ice hockey]] and [[indoor American football|indoor football]], and 4,800 for [[concert]]s. The arena floor measures 85 feet by 185 feet (27 by 62 meters). The dasher boards have 8-foot glass on the ends and 4-foot glass on the sides for ice hockey.  The arena is also used for conventions, circuses, ice shows, trade shows, and banquets, among other events.The arena has hosted many major headlining musicians throughout the years such as [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Ted Nugent]], [[Van Halen]], [[Bon Jovi]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Ratt]], [[Johnny Cash]].

The 1998 opening of [[RBC Centre (Sarnia)|RBC Centre]] in [[Sarnia, Ontario]] sent most of the arena's concert business across the [[St. Clair River]], which separates Port Huron from Sarnia. However, in 2010 McMorran started to rejuvenate their concert lineup with the band [[Third Eye Blind]]. In 2012, McMorran Arena and the adjacent pavilion were used for the Devil's Asylum [[Haunted attraction (simulated)|haunted house]].  As a result, the Fighting Falcons began their season on the road.

== Pavilion ==
The pavilion features {{convert|25000|sqft|m2}} of space for sporting events, trade shows, banquets, meetings, and conventions. In 2016, the city of Port Huron sold the pavilion to St. Clair County Community College for $1. Following the transaction, the Port Huron Minor Hockey Association, which was housed at the Pavilion, merged with the Blue Water Hockey Association, which is run out of Glacier Pointe Ice Complex in Port Huron. SC4 is renovating the building, and will open it in October as the SC4 Fieldhouse. It will serve as the home to SC4's athletic teams. It will also be available for community use, hosting tournaments, showcases and camps in various sports and at various levels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thetimesherald.com/story/news/local/port-huron/2016/07/01/sc4-fieldhouse-open-oct-3/86545630/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theatre ==
The 1,157-seat theatre is used for Broadway shows, movies, concerts, and other stage events. It features not only excellent acoustics and sight lines, but also a stage curtain, also designed by [[Alden B. Dow]]. It is home to the International Symphony Orchestra and the [[Port Huron Civic Theatre]].

In addition, there is a meeting room and a lounge at the complex.  Outside the building is a {{convert|22|ft|m|adj=mid|-diameter}} clock and the Night and Day fountain, both by sculptor [[Marshall Fredericks]].

The '''Mỹ Đình National Stadium''' ({{lang-vi|Sân vận động Quốc gia Mỹ Đình}}) is a multi-use stadium in [[Nam Từ Liêm]], [[Hanoi]] ([[Vietnam]]). It has a capacity of 40,192 seats and is the centerpiece of Vietnam's National Sports Complex. It was officially opened in September 2003 and was the main venue for the [[2003 Southeast Asian Games|Southeast Asian Games]] later that year, hosting the opening and closing ceremony as well as the men's [[Association football|football]] and athletics events.&lt;ref name="mydinh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thethao.tuoitre.vn/The-thao/159/San-van-dong-quoc-gia-My-Dinh-san-sang-phuc-vu-SEA-Games.html |title=Sân vận động quốc gia Mỹ Đình sẵn sàng phục vụ SEA Games |language=Vietnamese |work=Tuổi Trẻ online |date=2 September 2003 |accessdate=13 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323025552/http://thethao.tuoitre.vn/The-thao/159/San-van-dong-quoc-gia-My-Dinh-san-sang-phuc-vu-SEA-Games.html |archivedate=23 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium is home to the [[Vietnam national football team]], and hosts its home international friendly matches. It was also home to [[Thể Công]] from 2005 to 2008. It is currently home to [[Viettel F.C.]], with the stadium being its home since 2010.

Located 10 kilometres north-west of central Hanoi, the 40,000-seat stadium is the second biggest in the country in terms of capacity and was built at a cost of US$53 million. Arched roofs cover the grandstands on the east and west sides of the arena, providing shelter for half of the seats. 
 
The area provides training facilities for the teams with two football training grounds conveniently located next to the stadium.

==History==
Ideas for a new national stadium in Vietnam were marked up in 1998 as the government conducted a prefeasibility study for a national sports complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Làm trái phê duyệt vẫn trúng thầu|url=https://nld.com.vn/thoi-su-trong-nuoc/lam-trai-phe-duyet-van-trung-thau-79444.htm|website=Người Lao Động|accessdate=13 April 2018|language=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2000, [[Vietnamese Prime Minister]] [[Phan Văn Khải]] approved a project of a stadium at the heart of Vietnam's National Sports Complex in preparation for hosting the [[2003 Southeast Asian Games]]. Four firms, namely Hanoi International Group (HISG - China), [[Philipp Holzmann]] (Germany), [[Bouygues]] (France) and Lemna-Keystone (United States), participated in the bidding of the stadium's construction. The process was controversial due to violations of technical and financial requirements in HISG and Holzmann's bids, corruption allegations involving a French donation as well as the intransparency in the panel's decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chính phủ không chấp nhận nhà thầu Philipp Holzmann|url=https://kinhdoanh.vnexpress.net/tin-tuc/vi-mo/chinh-phu-khong-chap-nhan-nha-thau-philipp-holzmann-2664666.html|website=VNExpress|accessdate=13 April 2018|language=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ngọc Ẩn|author2=K.

Construction on the stadium started in 2002. During the developmental phase, the stadium was referred to as ''Sân vận động Trung tâm'' ("central stadium"). The stadium was architecturally complete in June 2003. In August 2003, the stadium was officially named ''Mỹ Đình National Stadium'', taking after the name of the commune area the stadium is located within. It was inaugurated on September 2, 2003 to coincide with [[National Day (Vietnam)|Vietnam's National Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sân vận động quốc gia mang tên Mỹ Đình|url=https://thethao.vnexpress.net/tin-tuc/bong-da-quoc-te-giai-ngoai-hang-anh/san-van-dong-quoc-gia-mang-ten-my-dinh-1046952.html|website=VNExpress|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RK Metković''' (Rukometni Klub Metković) is a [[Team handball|handball]] club from [[Metković]], [[Croatia]]. Currently, RK Metković competes in the [[Croatian First League of Handball]] and the [[Croatian Handball Cup]].

The club was founded on September 26, 1963 under the name '''Mehanika'''. RK Metković has changed its name several times since his foundation, so it played under the names of '''Razvitak''' and '''Metković-Jambo'''.

Today, this club has men's and female's section.

==Accomplishments==

Metković finished first in the league in 1999/2000 season before the playoff, but because of a player whose transfer from [[RK Zagreb]] to Metković wasn't completed (it was still a case in arbitration) played for them in a friendly match under a different name they were moved to second place. Therefore RK Zagreb had one home game more in the final where it managed to defeat RK Metković in five games with three home wins.

'''Respiratory adaptation''' is the specific changes that the [[respiratory system]] undergoes in response to the demands of [[Physical exercise|physical exertion]]. Intense physical exertion, such as that involved in [[fitness training]], places elevated demands on the respiratory system. Over time, this results in respiratory changes as the system adapts to these requirements.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ptdirect.com/training-design/anatomy-and-physiology/chronic-respiratory-adaptations-to-exercise|title=Respiratory System Adaptations to Exercise|website=www.ptdirect.com|publisher=PT Direct|language=en|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes ultimately result in an increased exchange of [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]], which is accompanied by an increase in [[metabolism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alley|first=Thomas R.|date=2014-02-25|title=Food sharing and empathic emotion regulation: an evolutionary perspective|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00121|issn=1664-1078|pmc=3933786|pmid=24611057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Respiratory adaptation is a physiological determinant of peak endurance performance, and in elite athletes, the pulmonary system is often a limiting factor to exercise under certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKenzie|first=Donald C.|date=2012-05-01|title=Respiratory physiology: adaptations to high-level exercise|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=46|issue=6|pages=381–384|doi=10.1136/bjsports-2011-090824|issn=1473-0480|pmid=22267571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neural control ==
Respiratory adaptation begins almost immediately after the initiation of the physical [[Stress (biology)|stress]] associated with exercise. This triggers signals from the [[motor cortex]] that stimulate the respiratory center of the [[Brainstem|brain stem]], in conjunction with feedback from the [[Proprioception|proprioreceptors]] in the muscles and joints of the active limbs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/sgr/pdf/chap3.pdf|title=Physical Activity and Health: A Report of the Surgeon General|last=|first=|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Physiologic Responses and Long-Term Adaptations to Exercise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breathing rate==
With higher intensity training, [[breathing rate]] is increased in order to allow more air to move in and out of the lungs, which enhances gas exchange. [[Endurance training]] typically results in an increase in the respiration rate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Lung capacity==
With adaptation, [[Tidal volume|lung capacity]] is increased over time, allowing a greater quantity of air to move in and out. Endurance training typically results in an increase in [[tidal volume]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Respiratory muscles==
Muscles involved in respiration, including the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] and [[intercostal muscles]], increase in strength and endurance. This results in an improved ability to breathe in more air, for longer amounts of time with less fatigue. [[Aerobic exercise|Aerobic training]] typically improves the endurance of respiratory muscles, whereas [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic training]] tends to increase the size and strength of respiratory muscles. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Lung capillaries==
Exercise increases the [[vascularization]] of the lungs. This allows the more blood flow in and out of the lungs. This enhances the uptake of oxygen, since there is greater surface area for blood to bind with [[haemoglobin]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Alveoli==
Respiratory adaptation results an increase in the number of [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], which enables more gas exchange to occur. This is coupled with an increase in alveolar oxygen tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hurtado|first=Alberto|date=30 September 1934|title=Respiratory adaptation to anoxemia|url=http://ajplegacy.physiology.org/content/109/4/626.article-info|journal=American Journal of Physiology|volume=109|doi=|pmid=|access-date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[baseball]], a '''setup man''' (or '''set-up man''', also sometimes referred to as a '''setup pitcher''' or '''setup reliever''') is a [[relief pitcher]] who regularly pitches before the [[closer (baseball)|closer]]. They commonly pitch the eighth [[inning]], with the closer pitching the ninth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball|first=Fran|last=Zimniuch|pages=154, 168|publisher=[[Triumph Books]]|location=Chicago|year=2010|isbn=978-1-60078-312-8 |ref=zimniuch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Felber |first=Bill |title=The Book on the Book: An Inquiry Into Which Strategies in the Modern Game Actually Work |page=102|year=2006 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Griffin]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-HZ3xF7DT7IC&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=setup%20man&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-312-33265-5 |accessdate=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As closers were reduced to one-inning specialists, setup men became more prominent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#zimniuch|Zimniuch 2010]], pp.168–9&lt;/ref&gt; Setup pitchers often come into the game with the team losing or the game tied.&lt;ref&gt;[[#zimniuch|Zimniuch 2010]], pp.169&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually the second best relief pitcher on a team, behind the closer.  After closers became one-inning pitchers, primarily in the ninth inning, setup pitchers became more highly valued.&lt;ref&gt;[[#zimniuch|Zimniuch 2010]], p.163&lt;/ref&gt; A pitcher who succeeds in this role is often promoted to a closer.&lt;ref&gt;[[#zimniuch|Zimniuch 2010]], pp.165,168,171–3&lt;/ref&gt; Setup men are paid less than closers and mostly make less than the average Major League salary.&lt;ref&gt;[[#zimniuch|Zimniuch 2010]], p.169&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common statistic used to evaluate relievers is the [[save (baseball)|save]]. Due to the definition of the statistic, setup men are rarely in position to record a save even if they pitch well, but they can be charged with a [[blown save]] if they pitch poorly. The [[hold (baseball)|hold]] statistic was developed to help acknowledge a setup man's effectiveness,&lt;ref&gt;[[#zimniuch|Zimniuch 2010]], pp.169–70&lt;/ref&gt; but it is not an official [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) statistic.

Historically, setup men were rarely selected to [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]]s, with the nod usually going to closers with large save totals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rancel|first=Tommy|title=Set-up guys who would be worthy All-Stars|date=June 24, 2013|work=ESPN.com|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/37360/set-up-guys-who-would-be-worthy-all-stars|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TG0Sbru7?url=http://espn.go.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/37360/set-up-guys-who-would-be-worthy-all-stars|archivedate=October 12, 2014|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1971 through 2000, only six relievers with fewer than five saves at midseason were selected as All-Stars.

[[Francisco Rodríguez (baseball, born 1982)|Francisco Rodriguez]], who was a setup pitcher for the [[Anaheim Angels]] in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Curry|first=Jack|title=Rodriguez Is a Fantasy Player Like No Other|date=October 11, 2002|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/11/sports/baseball-rodriguez-is-a-fantasy-player-like-no-other.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TFpID1FO?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/11/sports/baseball-rodriguez-is-a-fantasy-player-like-no-other.html|archivedate=October 11, 2014|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; tied starting pitcher [[Randy Johnson]]'s Major League Baseball record for [[win (baseball)|wins]] in a single postseason after recording his fifth victory in the [[2002 World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Chuck|title=Rodriguez set to close for Angels|date=February 20, 2005|newspaper=USA Today|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/al/angels/2005-02-20-angels-spring_x.htm|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TFpSTxW0?url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/al/angels/2005-02-20-angels-spring_x.htm|archivedate=October 11, 2014|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim McCarver]] wrote that the [[New York Yankees]] in 1996 "revolutionized baseball" with [[Mariano Rivera]], "a middle reliever who should have been on the All-Star team and who was a legitimate MVP candidate."&lt;ref name=zimniuch_p221&gt;[[#zimniuch|Zimniuch 2010]], p.221&lt;/ref&gt; He finished third in the voting for the [[American League]] (AL) [[Cy Young Award]],&lt;ref name=96cy&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1996.shtml#ALcya|title=1996 Awards Voting|work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=January 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the highest a setup man has finished.  That season, Rivera primarily served as a setup pitcher for closer [[John Wetteland]], typically pitching in the seventh and eighth inning of games before Wetteland pitched in the ninth. Their effectiveness gave the Yankees a 70–3&amp;nbsp;[[win–loss record (pitching)|win–loss record]] that season when leading after six innings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#zimniuch|Zimniuch 2010]], pp.219–221&lt;/ref&gt; McCarver said the Yankees played "six-inning games" that year, with Rivera dominating for two innings and Wetteland closing out the victory.&lt;ref name=zimniuch_p221/&gt;

Illustrating the general trend, both Rivera and Rodriguez were moved to closer soon after excelling as setup men.

'''Steven Charles Mix''' (born December 30, 1947), nicknamed '''The Mayor''', is an American [[Usher (occupation)|usher]] and former professional [[basketball]] player and coach.

==Basketball career==
Mix attended [[Rogers High School (Toledo, Ohio)|Rogers High School]] in [[Toledo, Ohio]], and the [[University of Toledo]].

Mix was a forward with a 13-year career from 1969&amp;ndash;1972 and from 1973&amp;ndash;1983. He played for the [[Detroit Pistons]], [[Philadelphia 76ers]], [[Milwaukee Bucks]] and [[Los Angeles Lakers]] all of the NBA and the [[Denver Rockets]] of the [[American Basketball Association|ABA]]. Mix represented the 76ers in the [[1975 NBA All-Star Game]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whitehotsports.com/?p=14132{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mix made it to the NBA Finals four times overall, three times with the 76ers (1977, 1980, 1982), but never won an NBA title. In 1983, when the 76ers did win the NBA title, Mix was a bench player for the Los Angeles Lakers, who were swept by the 76ers.

Following his retirement as a player, became basketball head coach at his alma mater, the [[University of Toledo]]. In his one year in the position during the 1984-1985 season, the team went 6-20.&lt;ref name=trinetrime&gt;{{cite web|title=Former NBA player to coach Trine women |url=http://www.d3hoops.com/notables/2012/04/former-nba-player-to-coach-trine-women |publisher=D3Hoops.com |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Mix spent 22 years as a [[color commentator]] on the 76ers' television broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=From impersonating Dr. J to coaching D-III, Steve Mix enjoying basketball |url=http://www.csnphilly.com/basketball-philadelphia-sixers/impersonating-dr-j-coaching-d-iii-steve-mix-enjoying-basketball |publisher=CSNPhilly.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232110/http://www.csnphilly.com/basketball-philadelphia-sixers/impersonating-dr-j-coaching-d-iii-steve-mix-enjoying-basketball |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he worked a basketball analyst for [[SportsTime Ohio]]. In 2012, Mix was named women's head coach at [[Trine University]].&lt;ref name=trinetrime /&gt; Mix left his position at Trine in 2014.

Since moving to Florida after his retirement at Trine, Mix has coached at basketball camps at [[Indian River State College]].

==Ushering career==
After his retirement from basketball, Mix and his wife moved to [[Vero Beach]], [[Florida]]. After calling [[Detroit Tigers]] clubhouse manager Jim Schmakel, Mix found a job as an usher for the [[New York Mets]] at [[First Data Field]] in nearby [[Port St. Lucie]], where the Mets hold [[Spring Training]] and where two of the Mets' minor-league affiliates, the [[St. Lucie Mets]] and the rookie-league [[Gulf Coast League Mets]], play. Regarding why he took up work as an usher, Mix said: "I heard somebody say sometime, when you retire and you do nothing, how do you know when you are done? I need that place where I can hang my hat. I just need a place where I can do something." Mix has received some recognition from fans who know him from his basketball days, including Mets Special Assistant to the General Manager [[J. P. Ricciardi]], who himself coached high school basketball teams at Holy Name High School in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Massachusetts]]. Besides Ricciardi, Mix said that a few people recognize him each day: "I have a couple people bring cards up ... probably a couple times a day somebody will say something."&lt;ref name=nypost&gt;{{cite web|title=Why is this ex-NBA star taking tickets at Mets games?|url=https://nypost.com/2017/03/19/why-is-this-ex-nba-star-taking-tickets-at-mets-games/|publisher=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Mix married his wife, Maryalice, in 1970. They have four children together and reside in [[Vero Beach]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref name=nypost /&gt;

During and since their playing days, when they were teammates and roommates, Mix and [[Julius Erving]] have been close friends, calling each other for their birthdays to the present day. Mix was nicknamed "Sky" by Erving; according to Mix, "Julius and [Mix] would talk hoops, [they] would talk life [and] family. Every night [Erving] would have a candy bar before he would go to bed. He used to say, 'I'm calling you [Mix] Sky because you can't.'"&lt;ref name=nypost /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4259">The '''University Golf Match''' (commonly known as the Varsity Match) is the annual [[golf]] match contested between the [[Blue (university sport)|Full Blue]] golf teams from [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University Golf Club|Cambridge]] universities. Dating back to 1878, it is the oldest amateur event in golf, as the first [[Amateur Championship]] was played in 1885. It is also the oldest team event in English golf. Scottish team matches were common after 1849, and included St Andrews University matches against Fife artisan clubs.&lt;ref&gt;"The Early Years of University Golf", John Gillum, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The Varsity Match was most recently contested in March 2018, at Royal Porthcawl Golf Club, and was won by Cambridge.

==History==
The first University Golf Match was played on 6 March 1878 at [[Wimbledon Common]], courtesy of [[London Scottish Golf Club]], which hosted the fixture for 19 years until it moved to [[Royal St George's Golf Club]] in 1897.&lt;ref name="Gillum"&gt;John Gillum, ''The Oxford and Cambridge Golfing Society: 100 Years of Serious Fun'', [[Grant Books]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The match was contested by four singles matches, and used the [[holes up]] method of scoring. Oxford, led by [[Horace Hutchinson]], won by a margin of 24 holes.&lt;ref name="Gillum" /&gt; Up to and including 2013, 124 University Golf Matches have been played.

In 1898 the Oxford and Cambridge Golfing Society (OCGS) was founded; members qualify by virtue of their participation in the University Golf Match. Since 1920, the OCGS has hosted the [[President's Putter]], an annual match-play competition for its members held at Rye Golf Club, in [[Rye]], [[East Sussex]].&lt;ref&gt;John Barton, [http://www.golfdigest.com/magazine/2009/12/presidents_putter_john_barton The Presidents Putter], ''[[Golf Digest]]'' (December, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venues==
Until the 1890s there were very few golf courses in England, and none of appropriate quality in the Oxford and Cambridge areas. The University Match was initially played on Wimbledon Common, which, along with [[Royal Blackheath]], was one of just a handful of courses in the London area at the time.

Since then, the University Golf Match has been played at courses all over the United Kingdom, including [[Royal St George's Golf Club|Royal St George's]], [[Royal Cinque Ports Golf Club|Royal Cinque Ports]], [[Royal Liverpool Golf Club|Royal Liverpool]], [[Muirfield]], [[Ganton, North Yorkshire|Ganton]], [[Walton Heath Golf Club|Walton Heath]], [[Hunstanton]], [[Aldeburgh]], [[Royal Porthcawl Golf Club|Royal Porthcawl]], and [[Sunningdale Golf Club|Sunningdale]].

The choice of venue alternates between the teams, and the match is traditionally played every five years at Rye (last played at Rye in 2014).

The 2019 Match will be played at [[Rye Golf Club]].

==Present-day competition==
Men - Each team comprises ten players plus two reserves. The reserves traditionally play the "Dinner Match" on the Thursday of the Varsity Match week: an 18-hole alternate shot [[foursomes]] match, followed by an 18-hole singles match. The losing team is responsible for paying the bill for the Varsity Match dinner on the Saturday evening.

The University Match itself is contested over the course of two days. Five 36-hole foursomes matches are played on the Friday, and ten 36-hole singles matches are played on the Saturday.

Ladies – 18-hole foursomes followed by 18 singles contested between 6 ladies from each team, with one reserve.  Although the reserved play a match the score does not count towards the final score.  The Ladies' match is held on the Tuesday of Varsity week as the beginning of the matches.

On Thursday, 16 June 1743, there was a game in which a team from [[Bermondsey]] defeated one from [[Deptford]] &amp; [[Deptford Dockyard|the King’s Yard]] by an innings and 27 runs. It was clearly a minor fixture but [[F. S. Ashley-Cooper]] explained that Walworth Common was situated where Westmoreland Road, Faraday Street and Mann Street stood in 1900. He said the ground was "about three-quarters of a mile from where [[Montpelier Cricket Club]]'s [[Aram's New Ground|Bee Hive Ground]] afterwards existed".&lt;ref name=ASW21&gt;Ashley-Cooper, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
