[[File:300B outline drawing metric.svg|thumb|300B dimensions in mm]]
In [[electronics]] the '''300B''' is a directly-heated power [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]] with a four-pin base, introduced in 1938 by [[Western Electric]] to amplify telephone signals. It measures 6.4&amp;nbsp;inches high and 2.4&amp;nbsp;inches wide, and the [[anode]] can dissipate 40 watts. In the 1980s it started to be used increasingly by [[audiophile]]s in home audio equipment. The 300B has good linearity, low noise and good reliability; it is often used in [[single-ended triode]] (SET) audio amplifiers of about eight [[watt]]s output; a push-pull pair can output 20 watts.

{{As of|2012}} manufacturers of 300B and other tubes of similar characteristics included [[New_Sensor_Corporation|EH Electro Harmonix]], [[Emission Labs - EML]], [[JJ Electronic]], [[KR Audio]], Shuguang, [[Sovtek]], Svetlana, [[TJ FullMusic]], Takatsuki, and [[Western Electric]]. Prices for new 300B tubes ranged from US$175 to $2,000 per matched pair.

[[Western Electric]], now a small, privately owned company in [[Rossville, Georgia]] resumed production of the original 300B in 2018 using the original, 1938 manufacturing standards on a modernized assembly line housed at the Rossville Works.

'''99942 Apophis''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|p|ɒ|f|ɪ|s}}, previously known by its [[provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]] '''{{mp|2004 MN|4}}''') is a 370 meter diameter [[Near-Earth asteroids|near-Earth asteroid]] that caused a brief period of concern in December 2004 because initial observations indicated a  probability of up to 2.7% that it would hit [[Earth]] on April&amp;nbsp;13, 2029. Additional observations provided improved predictions that eliminated the possibility of an [[impact event|impact on Earth]] or the [[Moon]] in 2029. However, until 2006, a possibility remained that during the 2029 close encounter with Earth, Apophis would pass through a [[gravitational keyhole]], a small region no more than about 0.5 mile wide, or 0.8&amp;nbsp;km&lt;ref name=keyhole /&gt;&lt;ref name="Neil deGrasse Tyson - Death By Giant Meteor"/&gt; that would set up a future impact exactly seven years later on April&amp;nbsp;13, 2036. This possibility kept it at Level&amp;nbsp;1 on the [[Torino scale|Torino impact hazard scale]] until August 2006, when the probability that Apophis would pass through the keyhole was determined to be very small. By 2008, the keyhole had been determined to be less than 1&amp;nbsp;km wide.&lt;ref name=keyhole /&gt; During the short time when it had been of greatest concern, Apophis set the record for highest rating on the [[Torino scale]], reaching level&amp;nbsp;4 on 27 December 2004.&lt;ref name=nasanews146 /&gt;

As of 2014, the diameter of Apophis is estimated to be approximately {{convert|370|m}}.&lt;ref name=riskneo/&gt; Preliminary observations by [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] radar in January 2013 effectively ruled out the possibility of an Earth impact by Apophis in 2036.&lt;ref name="NASA2013-017" /&gt;  By May 6, 2013 (April 15, 2013 observation arc), the probability of an impact on April 13, 2036 had been eliminated.&lt;ref name=riskneo /&gt;  Using observations through February 26, 2014&lt;!--2018 note: there WERE observations made into 2015, but it is not incorporated in the sentry table assessment for whatever reason. Make sure the last date of incorporated observations is in 2015 as well before you attempt to update.--&gt;, the odds of an impact on April 12, 2068, as calculated by the JPL [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry risk table]] are 1 in 150,000.&lt;ref name=riskneo/&gt; {{as of|2018|03}}, there were seven asteroids with a more notable cumulative [[Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale]] than Apophis.&lt;ref name="risk-table" /&gt;  On average, one asteroid the size of Apophis (370 metres) can be expected to impact Earth about every 80,000 years.&lt;ref name="Earth-impact" /&gt;

== Discovery and naming ==
Apophis was discovered on June 19, 2004, by [[Roy A. Tucker]], [[David J. Tholen]], and [[Fabrizio Bernardi]] at the [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]].&lt;ref name=jpldata /&gt; On December 21, 2004, Apophis passed {{convert|0.0963|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from Earth.&lt;ref name=jpldata /&gt; [[Precovery]] observations from March 15, 2004, were identified on December&amp;nbsp;27, and an improved orbit solution was computed.&lt;ref name="MPEC2004-Y70" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nasanews148" /&gt; [[Radar astronomy|Radar]] astrometry in January 2005 further refined its orbit solution.&lt;ref name=Arecibo /&gt;&lt;ref name="nasanews149" /&gt;. The discovery was notable in that it was at a very low [[solar elongation]] (56°) and at very long range (1.1 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]]). See diagram below:

{{wide image|Positions_of_Near_Earth_Asteroids_at_time_of_discovery.png|800px|align-cap=center|Position of 99942 Apophis relative the [[Earth]] and [[Sun]], compared to the positions of other [[Near-Earth object|NEO]]s at the time of their discovery&lt;ref name="NASA-NEO-Close-Approach-Data"&gt;{{cite web |title=NEO Earth Close Approach data |url=https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/ca/ |website=NASA JPL |publisher=NASA |accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When first discovered, the object received the provisional designation {{mp|2004 MN|4}}, and news and scientific articles about it referred to it by that name. When its orbit was sufficiently well calculated, it received the permanent number 99942 (on June&amp;nbsp;24, 2005). Receiving a permanent number made it eligible for naming by its discoverers, and it received the name "Apophis" on July&amp;nbsp;19, 2005.&lt;ref name=naming /&gt; [[Apep|Apophis]] is the [[Greek language|Greek]] name of an enemy of the [[Ancient Egyptian]] sun-god [[Ra]]: [[Apep]], the Uncreator, an evil serpent that dwells in the eternal darkness of the [[Duat]] and tries to swallow Ra during his nightly passage. Apep is held at bay by [[Set (mythology)|Set]], the Ancient Egyptian god of storms and the desert.
[[David J. Tholen]] and Tucker—two of the co-discoverers of the asteroid—are reportedly fans of the TV series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''. One of the show's persistent villains is an alien named [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]]. He is one of the principal threats to the existence of civilization on Earth through the first few seasons, thus likely why the asteroid was named after him. In the fictional world of the show, the alien's backstory was that he had lived on Earth during ancient times and had posed as a god, thereby giving rise to the myth of the Egyptian god of the same name.&lt;ref name=naming&gt;{{cite journal

|title=Asteroid Apophis set for a makeover|author=Bill Cooke
|journal=Astronomy Magazine|date=August 18, 2005|accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==
[[File:Apophis model comparison.png|thumb|Comparison between the best-fit convex and nonconvex shape models, and some of the available radar images of (99942) Apophis.]]

Based upon the observed brightness, Apophis's diameter was initially estimated at {{convert|450|m}}; a more refined estimate based on spectroscopic observations at [[NASA]]'s [[Infrared Telescope Facility]] in Hawaii by Binzel, Rivkin, Bus, and Tokunaga (2005) is {{convert|350|m}}. NASA's impact risk page lists the diameter at {{convert|330|m}} and lists a mass of 4{{e|10}} kg based on an assumed density of 2.6 g/cm{{sup|3}}.&lt;ref name=riskneo /&gt; The mass estimate is more approximate than the diameter estimate, but should be accurate to within a factor of three.&lt;ref name=riskneo /&gt; Apophis's surface composition probably matches that of [[LL chondrite]]s.&lt;ref name=Reddy2018/&gt;

Based on Goldstone and Arecibo radar images taken in 2012-2013, [[Marina Brozović|Brozović]] et al. have estimated that Apophis is an elongated object 450&amp;thinsp;×&amp;thinsp;170 metres in size, and that it is bilobed (possibly a [[Contact binary (small Solar System body)|contact binary]]) with a relatively bright surface albedo of {{val|0.35|0.10}}. Its rotation axis has an [[obliquity]] of -59° against the [[ecliptic]], which means that Apophis is a [[retrograde rotation|retrograde rotator]].&lt;ref name=Brozovic2018/&gt;

During the 2029 approach, Apophis's brightness will peak at [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]]&amp;nbsp;3.1,&lt;ref name="NEODyS2029" /&gt; easily visible to the naked eye if one knows where to look, with a maximum angular speed of 42° per hour. The maximum apparent [[angular diameter]] will be ~2&amp;nbsp;[[arcsecond]]s, so that it will be barely [[optical resolution|resolved]] by ground-based telescopes not equipped with [[adaptive optics]]. Due to the small distance, it is likely that [[tides|tidal forces]] will alter Apophis's rotation axis. A partial resurfacing of the asteroid is possible, which might change its spectral class from a [[Space weathering|weathered]] Sq- to an unweathered [[Q-type asteroid|Q-type]].&lt;ref name=Brozovic2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reddy2018/&gt;

== Orbit ==
=== Close approaches ===
After the [[Minor Planet Center]] confirmed the June discovery of Apophis, an April&amp;nbsp;13, 2029 close approach was flagged by NASA's automatic [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry]] system and [[NEODyS]], a similar automatic program run by the [[University of Pisa]] and the [[University of Valladolid]]. On that date, it will become as bright as magnitude&amp;nbsp;3.1&lt;ref name="NEODyS2029" /&gt; (visible to the [[naked eye]] from rural as well as darker suburban areas, visible with [[binoculars]] from most locations).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icq.eps.harvard.edu/MagScale.html ''The astronomical magnitude scale.''] International Comet Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; The close approach will be visible from [[Europe]], [[Africa]], and western [[Asia]]. During the close approach in 2029 Earth will [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturb]] Apophis from an [[Aten asteroid|Aten]] class orbit with a [[semi-major axis]] of 0.92&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] to an [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo]] class orbit with a semi-major axis of 1.1&amp;nbsp;AU.
After Sentry and NEODyS announced the possible impact, additional observations decreased the uncertainty in Apophis's trajectory. As they did, the probability of an impact event in 2029 temporarily climbed, peaking at 2.7% (1 in 37) on 27 December 2004.&lt;ref name="nasanews164" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mirror"/&gt; This probability, combined with its size, caused Apophis to be assessed at level 4 on the [[Torino Scale]]&lt;ref name=nasanews146 /&gt; and 1.10 on the [[Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale]], scales scientists use to represent how dangerous a given asteroid is to Earth. These are the highest values for which any object has been rated on either scale. The chance that there would be an impact in 2029 was eliminated by late December 27, 2004 as a result of a precovery image that extended the observation arc back to March 2004.&lt;ref name="nasanews148" /&gt; The danger of a 2036 passage was lowered to level 0 on the Torino Scale in August 2006.&lt;ref name="Wayback2006-08" /&gt; With a cumulative Palermo Scale rating of −3.2,&lt;ref name=riskneo /&gt; the risk of impact from Apophis is less than one thousandth the background hazard level.&lt;ref name=riskneo /&gt;

{{Large near earth asteroid flybys 2LD}}

=== 2029/2036/2068 approaches ===
On April 13, 2029, Apophis will pass Earth within the orbits of [[geosynchronous]] [[communication satellite]]s, but will come no closer than {{convert|19400|mi|order=flip}} above Earth's surface.&lt;ref name="NASA2013-017" /&gt; The 2029 pass will be much closer than had first been predicted in 2004 when the observation arc was very short.&lt;ref name=nasanews146/&gt; The pass in late March 2036 will be no closer than about {{convert|14|e6mi|order=flip}}—and will most likely miss Earth by about {{convert|35|e6mi|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name="Beatty2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NEODyS2036"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== 2005 and 2011 observations ====
In July 2005, former [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronaut [[Rusty Schweickart]], as chairman of the [[B612 Foundation]], formally asked NASA to investigate the possibility that the asteroid's post-2029 orbit could be in [[orbital resonance]] with Earth, which would increase the probability of future impacts. Schweickart also asked NASA to investigate whether a [[transponder]] should be placed on the asteroid to enable more accurate tracking of how its orbit is affected by the [[Yarkovsky effect]].&lt;ref name="Schweickart" /&gt; On January 31, 2011, astronomers took the first new images of Apophis in more than 3 years.&lt;ref name="Tholen" /&gt;

[[File:Apophis ellipse.svg|thumb|right|Illustration of a common trend where progressively reduced uncertainty regions result in an asteroid impact probability increasing followed by a sharp decrease.]]

==== 2013 refinement ====
The close approach in 2029 will substantially alter the object's orbit, prompting Jon Giorgini of JPL to say: "If we get radar ranging in 2013 [the next good opportunity], we should be able to predict the location of {{mp|2004 MN|4}} out to at least 2070."&lt;ref name="Science" /&gt; Apophis passed within {{convert|0.0966|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} of Earth in 2013, allowing astronomers to refine the trajectory for future close passes.&lt;ref name=esanews1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NEODys /&gt;&lt;ref name="refine2013" /&gt; Just after the closest approach on 9 January 2013,&lt;ref name=NEODys /&gt; the asteroid peaked at an [[apparent magnitude]]&amp;nbsp; of about 15.7.&lt;ref name="NEODyS2013" /&gt; [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] observed Apophis during that approach from January 3 through January 17.&lt;ref name="Goldstone" /&gt; The [[Arecibo Observatory]] observed Apophis once it entered Arecibo's declination window after February 13, 2013.&lt;ref name="Goldstone" /&gt;

A NASA assessment as of 21 February 2013 that does not use the 2013 radar measurements gave an impact probability of 2.3 in a million for 2068.&lt;ref name=news178&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news178.html|title=Apophis Risk Assessment Updated}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 6 May 2013, using observations through April 15, 2013, the odds of an impact on 12 April 2068 as calculated by the JPL Sentry risk table had increased to 3.9 in a million (1 in 256,000).&lt;ref name=riskneo /&gt;

==== 2015 observations ====
As of April 2018, Apophis has not been observed since 2015, mostly because its orbit has put it very near the Sun from the perspective of Earth. It has not been further than 60 degrees from the Sun at any point since April 2014, and will remain so until December 2019. With the most recent 2015 observations, the 12 April 2068 impact is now 6.7 in a million (1 in 150,000), and the asteroid has a cumulative 9 in a million (1 in 110,000) chance of impacting Earth before 2106.

If Apophis is a [[retrograde motion|''retrograde'' rotator]] on the small, less-massive end of what is possible, the measurement uncertainty region will get pushed back such that the center of the distribution encounters Earth's orbit.

== Potential space missions ==
=== Planetary Society competition ===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2008}}
In 2007, The [[Planetary Society]], a [[California]]-based space advocacy group, organized a $50,000 competition to design an unmanned space probe that would 'shadow' Apophis for almost a year, taking measurements that would "determine whether it will impact Earth, thus helping governments decide whether to mount a deflection mission to alter its orbit". The society received 37&amp;nbsp;entries from 20&amp;nbsp;countries on 6&amp;nbsp;continents.

The commercial competition was won by a design called 'Foresight' created by [[SpaceWorks Enterprises, Inc.]]&lt;ref name="competition"&gt;{{cite news | author=Paul Rincon| authorlink=BBC News | title=US team wins asteroid competition | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7265608.stm | accessdate=2009-03-25 | date=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; SpaceWorks proposed a simple orbiter with only two instruments and a radio beacon at a cost of ~140&amp;nbsp;million USD, launched aboard a [[Minotaur (rocket family)|Minotaur IV]] between 2012 and 2014, to arrive at Apophis five to ten months later. It would then rendezvous with, observe, and track the asteroid. Foresight would orbit the asteroid to gather data with a [[multi-spectral image]]r for one month. It would then leave orbit and fly in formation with Apophis around the Sun at a range of two&amp;nbsp;kilometres (1.2&amp;nbsp;miles). The spacecraft would use laser ranging to the asteroid and radio tracking from Earth for ten months to accurately determine the asteroid's orbit and how it might change.

Pharos, the winning student entry, would be an orbiter with four science instruments (a multi-spectral imager, [[Near-infrared spectroscopy|near-infrared spectrometer]], [[laser rangefinder]], and [[magnetometer]]) that would rendezvous with and track Apophis. Earth-based tracking of the spacecraft would then allow precise tracking of the asteroid. The Pharos spacecraft would also carry four instrumented probes that it would launch individually over the course of two weeks. [[Accelerometer]]s and temperature sensors on the probes would measure the seismic effects of successive probe impacts, a creative way to explore the interior structure and dynamics of the asteroid.

Second place, for $10,000, went to a European team led by [[Deimos Space]] S.L. of [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], in cooperation with [[EADS Astrium]], Friedrichshafen, Germany; [[University of Stuttgart]], Germany; and [[Università di Pisa]], Italy. Juan L. Cano was [[principal investigator]].

Another European team took home $5,000 for third place. Their team lead was [[EADS Astrium Ltd]], United Kingdom, in conjunction with EADS Astrium SAS, France; IASF-Roma, INAF, Rome, Italy; [[Open University]], UK; Rheinisches Institut für Umweltforschung, Germany; [[Royal Observatory of Belgium]]; and [[Telespazio]], Italy.  The principal investigator was Paolo D'Arrigo.

Two teams tied for second place in the Student Category: [[Monash University]], Clayton Campus, Australia, with Dilani Kahawala as principal investigator; and [[University of Michigan]], with Jeremy Hollander as principal investigator. Each second place team won $2,000.  A team from [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]] and [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]], under the leadership of Peter Weiss, received an honorable mention and $1,000 for the most innovative student proposal.

=== Planned Chinese mission ===
China plans an exploration fly-by mission to Apophis after 2020 when the asteroid comes to within a distance of 30,000 kilometers of Earth. The distance, a hair's breadth in astronomical terms, is within the orbit of the moon, and even closer than some man-made satellites. It will be the closest asteroid of its size in recorded history. This fly by mission to Apophis is part of an asteroid exploration mission planned after China's Mars mission in 2020 currently in development, according to Ji Jianghui, a researcher at the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a member of the expert committee for scientific goal argumentation of deep space exploration in China. The whole mission will include exploration and close study of three asteroids by sending a probe to fly side by side with Apophis for a period to conduct close observation, and land on the asteroid [[(175706) 1996 FG3|1996 FG3]] to conduct in situ sampling analysis on the surface. The probe is also expected to conduct a fly-by of a third asteroid to be determined at a later time.
The whole mission would last around six years, said Ji.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Riding_an_asteroid_Chinas_next_space_goal_999.html|title=Riding an asteroid: China's next space goal|author=Yu Fei|website=Xinhua News|date=7 March 2017|access-date=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 30, 2009, [[Anatoly Perminov]], the director of the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]], said in an interview that [[Roscosmos]] will also study designs for a possible deflection mission to Apophis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=ISACHENKOV |first=VLADIMIR |title=Russia may send spacecraft to knock away asteroid |work=Yahoo!

On August 16, 2011, researchers at China's [[Tsinghua University]] proposed launching a mission to knock Apophis onto a safer course using an impactor spacecraft in a retrograde orbit, steered and powered by a solar sail. Instead of moving the asteroid on its potential resonant return to Earth, Shengping Gong and his team believe the secret is shifting the asteroid away from entering the gravitational keyhole in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=China Reveals Solar Sail Plan To Prevent Apophis Hitting Earth in 2036 |work=Technology Review Physics arXiv Blog |accessdate=2011-08-18 |date=2011-08-18 |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/27088/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 15, 2016, Sabit Saitgarayev, of the [[Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau]], announced intentions to use [[Russia]]n [[ICBM]]s to target relatively small [[near-Earth object]]s. Although the report stated that likely targets would be between the 20 to 50 metres in size, it was also stated that 99942 Apophis would be an object subject to tests by the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Russia wants to target near-Earth objects with its ICBMs |work=TASS in foxnews.com |accessdate=2016-02-15 |date=2016-02-15 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2016/02/15/russia-wants-to-target-near-earth-objects-with-its-icbms.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==
* In [[Id Software]]'s [[video game]] ''[[Rage (video game)|Rage]]'', the back-story involves asteroid Apophis colliding with Earth, nearly wiping out humanity and ushering in a [[post-apocalypse|post-apocalyptic]] age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rage Interview: We speak with id's Tim Willits about their new IP, Rage |website=Gamespot |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/rage/video/6176219/rage-interview?nonRedirectElement=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aquarius Reef Base''' is an [[underwater habitat]] located 5.4 miles (9 kilometers) off [[Key Largo]] in the [[Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary]]. It is deployed on the ocean floor 62 feet (19 meters) below the surface and next to a deep coral reef named [[Conch Reef]].

Aquarius is one of three undersea laboratories in the world dedicated to science and education. Two additional undersea facilities, also located in Key Largo, FL are owned and operated by Marine Resources Development Foundation. Aquarius was owned by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) and operated by the [[University of North Carolina at Wilmington|University of North Carolina&amp;ndash;Wilmington]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Aquarius undersea laboratory: The next generation|journal=In: MA Lang, CC Baldwin (Eds.) the Diving for Science…1996, "Methods and Techniques of Underwater Research" |volume=Proceedings of the American Academy of Underwater Sciences |issue=Sixteenth annual Scientific Diving Symposium |year=1996 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4703 |accessdate=February 26, 2012|last1=Shepard|first1=Andrew N.|last2=Dinsmore|first2=David A.|last3=Miller|first3=Steven L.|last4=Cooper|first4=Craig B.|authorlink4=Craig B.

Florida International University (FIU) took ownership of Aquarius in October 2014. As part of the FIU Marine Education and Research Initiative, the Medina Aquarius Program is dedicated to the study and preservation of marine ecosystems worldwide and is enhancing the scope and impact of FIU on research, educational outreach, technology development, and professional training. At the heart of the program is the Aquarius Reef Base.&lt;ref&gt;http://aquarius.fiu.edu/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
Aquarius, designed by Perry Submarine Builders of Florida and constructed by Victoria Machine Works, was built in [[Victoria, Texas|Victoria]], [[Texas]], in 1986.&lt;ref name=RRR10204&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kesling, D |author2=Berey, R |title=Training, equipment, and operational procedures for conducting scientific saturation diving activities |journal=In: Lang, MA; Jaap, WC (ed).

Bond]]", who was the father of [[SEALAB|Sealab]] in particular and [[saturation diving]] in general.&lt;ref name="Hellwarth1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hellwarth|first=Ben|title=Sealab: America's Forgotten Quest to Live and Work on the Ocean Floor|location=[[New York City|New York]]|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|year=2012|page=259|isbn=978-0-7432-4745-0|lccn=2011015725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V4sbNMwQJI4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Underwater operations were first planned for Catalina Island, California, but were moved to the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]]. Following [[Hurricane Hugo]] in 1989, Aquarius was taken to Wilmington, NC for repairs and refurbishment and was redeployed in the Florida Keys in 1993. Aquarius is located under {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}} of water at the base of a [[coral reef]] within the [[Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary]], an ideal site for studying the health of sensitive coral reefs.

The laboratory is most often used by marine biologists for whom Aquarius acts as home base as they study the coral reef, the fish and aquatic plants that live nearby and the composition of the surrounding seawater. Aquarius houses sophisticated lab equipment and computers, enabling scientists to perform research and process samples without leaving their underwater facilities.

The habitat accommodates four scientists and two technicians for missions averaging ten days. Scientists on the Aquarius are often called "[[Aquanauts]]" (as they live underwater at depth pressure for a period equal to or greater than 24 continuous hours without returning to the surface). A technique known as [[saturation diving]] allows the aquanauts to live and work underwater for days or weeks at a time. After twenty four hours underwater at any depth, the human body becomes saturated with dissolved gas. With saturation diving, divers can accurately predict exactly how much time they need to decompress before returning to the surface. This information limits the risk of decompression sickness. By living in the Aquarius habitat and working at the same depth on the ocean floor, Aquarius aquanauts are able to remain underwater for the duration of their mission. 
In addition, because Aquarius allows saturation diving, dives from the habitat can last for up to nine hours at a time; by comparison, surface dives usually last between one and two hours. These long dive times allow for observation that would not otherwise be possible. Way stations on the reef outside Aquarius allow aquanauts to refill their scuba tanks during dives.&lt;ref name="Prager 1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Prager|first=Ellen J.|title=Chasing Science at Sea: Racing Hurricanes, Stalking Sharks, &amp; Living Undersea With Ocean Experts|publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]]|location=[[Chicago]], [[London]]|year=2008|page=113|isbn=978-0-226-67870-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hellwarth2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=V4sbNMwQJI4C Hellwarth], pp. 260-261.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat structure==
Aquarius consists of three compartments. Access to the water is made via the 'wet porch', a chamber equipped with a [[moon pool]], which keeps the air pressure inside the wet porch the same as the water pressure at that depth ('ambient pressure'), about 2.6 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]], through [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. The main compartment is strong enough, like a submarine, to maintain normal [[atmospheric pressure]], and can also be pressurized to ambient pressure, and is usually held at a pressure in between. The smallest compartment, the Entry Lock, is between the other two and functions as an [[airlock]] in which personnel wait while pressure is adjusted to match either the wet porch or the main compartment.
[[Image:Aquarius floorplan.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Floorplan of Aquarius.]]
[[File:Aquarius external.jpg|thumb|Another view of the habitat]]
This design enables personnel to return to the surface without the need for a [[decompression chamber]] when they get there. Personnel stay inside the main compartment for 17 hours before ascending as the pressure is slowly reduced, so that they do not suffer [[decompression sickness]] after the ascent.&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0309/feature4/fulltext.html|first=Gregory|last=Stone|title=Deep Science @ National Geographic Magazine - National Geographic Online Extra|date=September 2003|publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|accessdate=February 29, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017103544/http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0309/feature4/fulltext.html|archive-date=2007-10-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underwater missions and research ==

Several missions on the Aquarius have been canceled due to [[hurricane]] activity. During [[Hurricane Gordon (1994)|Hurricane Gordon]] in 1994, a crew of scientists and divers had to evacuate Aquarius and climb up a rescue line to the surface in 15-foot seas after one of the habitat's generators caught fire.&lt;ref name="Prager 2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PKv5IqpoMh4C Prager], pp. 118-120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Health"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consumer.healthday.com/encyclopedia/article.asp?AID=646426|title=Health Library Articles|date=March 20, 2011|last=Helvarg|first=David|publisher=[[HealthDay]]|accessdate=February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Hurricane Georges]] nearly destroyed Aquarius, breaking a joint in one of its legs and moving two 8000-pound weights on the wet porch nearly off the structure. Both Hurricane Georges and [[Hurricane Mitch]], later in 1998, also destroyed way stations outside Aquarius used to refill aquanauts' scuba tanks.&lt;ref name="Prager 2"/&gt; In 2005, Hurricane Rita broke two of the habitat's seabed anchors and moved one end of Aquarius by twelve feet.&lt;ref name="Prager 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Faceplate"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Faceplate|date=January 2006|volume=9|issue=1|url=http://www.supsalv.org/pdf/FACEPLATEFeb2006.pdf|title=Seabee Divers Help NOAA Restore Aquarius Undersea Lab|author=Public Affairs, UCT2|pages=10, 20|accessdate=February 28, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217160119/http://www.supsalv.org/pdf/FACEPLATEFeb2006.pdf|archivedate=February 17, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 [[Hurricane Irma]] ripped the habitat's 94,000 pound life support buoy from its moorings and blew it 14 miles away to the Lignum Vitae Channel, as well as damaging the underwater living quarters and 'wet porch' area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/weather/hurricane/article175796051.html|title=Irma battered, but didn’t beat, this beloved underwater lab|date=September 27, 2017|last=Staletovich|first=Jenny|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2008}}, no scientists or staff members had been injured at Aquarius due to storms &lt;ref name="Prager 2"/&gt;

Since 2001, [[NASA]] has used Aquarius for its [[NEEMO]] (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) [[analog mission]]s, sending groups of [[astronauts]] to simulate [[human spaceflight]] space exploration missions. Much like space, the undersea world is a hostile, alien place for humans to live. NEEMO crew members experience some of the same challenges there that they would on a distant asteroid, planet or moon. During NEEMO missions in Aquarius, the aquanauts are able to simulate living on a spacecraft and test spacewalk techniques for future space missions. The underwater condition has the additional benefit of allowing NASA to "weight" the aquanauts to simulate different gravity environments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NEEMO/about_neemo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A diver named [[Dewey Smith]] died during a dive from Aquarius in May 2009.&lt;ref name="Hellwarth2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Silk"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Key West Citizen]]|last=Silk|first=Robert|title=Aquarius diver's death remains a question|date=May 9, 2009|publisher=Cooke Communications|url=http://keysnews.com/node/13119|accessdate=January 25, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326062542/http://keysnews.com/node/13119|archivedate=March 26, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent investigation determined that Smith's death was caused by a combination of factors, including the failure of the electronic functions of his [[Rebreather#Fully closed circuit rebreather|Inspiration closed circuit rebreather]] due to hydrodynamic forces from a hydraulic impact hammer being used nearby.&lt;ref name="Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aaus.memberclicks.net/ccboard/10100473_1322493065940.pdf |title=External Review Board Report of Findings and Recommendations |publisher=[[American Academy of Underwater Sciences]] |date=August 27, 2009 |accessdate=July 16, 2012 |format=PDF }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to budget cuts, NOAA ceased funding Aquarius after September 2012, with no further missions scheduled after a July 2012 mission that included pioneering female diver [[Sylvia Earle]] in its aquanaut crew. The University of North Carolina Wilmington was also unable to provide funding to continue operations. The Aquarius Foundation was set up in an attempt to keep Aquarius functioning.&lt;ref name="Gizmodo 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/5925852/searching-for-the-oceans-secrets-from-the-last-undersea-base?tag=missionaquarius|last=Lam|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Lam|title=Searching for the Ocean's Secrets From the Last Undersea Base|date=July 13, 2012|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|accessdate=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gizmodo 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/5930670/how-humans-learned-to-live-underwater|last=Hellwarth|first=Ben|title=How Humans Learned To Live Under Water|date=August 3, 2012|publisher=Gawker Media|accessdate=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a two-week series the daily [[cartoon strip]] ''[[Sherman's Lagoon]]'' featured the potential closing of the Aquarius facility in the week starting September 10, 2012, and continued with a cameo appearance of Sylvia Earle in the week starting September 17, 2012, to discuss the importance of Aquarius.&lt;ref name="INK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.dailyink.com/2012/09/17/this-week-in-comics-what-to-read/ |title=This Week in Comics: What To Read - DailyINK Blog |author=Support |publisher=[[King Features Syndicate]] |date=September 17, 2012 |accessdate=September 18, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919182929/http://blog.dailyink.com/2012/09/17/this-week-in-comics-what-to-read/ |archivedate=September 19, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, a proposal to keep Aquarius running under Florida International University administration was accepted.&lt;ref name="FIU"/&gt;

From June 1 to July 2, 2014, [[Fabien Cousteau]] and his crew spent [[Mission 31|31 days living and working in Aquarius]] in tribute to [[Jacques Cousteau]]'s 30-day underwater expedition in 1963. Cousteau estimated the team collected the equivalent of two years' worth of surface diving data during the mission, enough for ten scientific papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fabien Cousteau Calls the Ocean 'Second Home' After 31-Day Undersea Mission|date=July 2, 2014|work=Good Morning America|publisher=ABC News|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/fabien-cousteau-set-emerge-31-day-underwater-mission/story?id=24395897|author=Alyssa Newcomb|accessdate=July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=5 Things to Know About Cousteau's Undersea Mission|agency=AP|publisher=ABC News|date=July 2, 2014|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/things-cousteaus-undersea-mission-24396542|accessdate=July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Barotse [[Floodplain]]''' &lt;!--PLEASE NOTE "Barotse Floodplain" is used as a proper name with initial cap on Floodplain as per map/atlas references given--&gt;also known as the '''Bulozi Plain''', '''Lyondo''' or the '''Zambezi Floodplain''' is one of Africa's great [[Zambezian flooded grasslands|wetland]]s, on the [[Zambezi River]] in the [[Western Province, Zambia|Western Province]] of [[Zambia]]. It is a designated [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar site]], regarded as being of high conservation value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wetlands.org/reports/ris/1ZM007_2007.pdf "Zambezi Floodplain Ramsar Information Sheet"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326150707/http://www.wetlands.org/reports/ris/1ZM007_2007.pdf |date=March 26, 2009 }}, in ''Ramsar Sites Information Service'', [[Wetlands International]]. Retrieved 22 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name recognises the [[floodplain]] as spawning the culture and way of life of the [[Lozi people]], "Rotse" being a variant of ''Lozi'', and "Ba" meaning "people". They became a powerful kingdom in [[Central Africa|Central]]/[[Southern Africa]] under their King or [[Litunga]], [[Lewanika]], whose realm extended up to 300&amp;nbsp;km from the plain and was called [[Barotseland]].

==Topography and area==
The region is a flat [[plateau]] at an elevation of about 1000&amp;nbsp;m tilting very slightly to the south. The Zambezi and its headwaters rise on the higher ground to the north, which enjoys good rainfall (1400&amp;nbsp;mm annually) in a [[rainy season]] from October to May. A flood moves down the river reaching a flat region, formed from [[Kalahari]] sands, about five hundred kilometres across. To the south around the [[Ngonye Falls]] harder rock is found at the surface and has resisted the river's tendency to cut a channel down into it, and so acts a bit like a dam. Behind it the floodplain has formed. Below the falls the river falls nearly twice as fast as it does on the plain, and flows more swiftly in a narrower valley less prone to flooding.

The floodplain stretches from the Zambezi's [[confluence]] with the [[Kabompo River|Kabompo]] and [[Lungwebungu River]]s in the north, to a point about 230&amp;nbsp;km south, above the Ngonye falls and south of [[Senanga]]. Along most of its length its width is over 30&amp;nbsp;km, reaching 50&amp;nbsp;km at the widest, just north of [[Mongu]], principal town of the plain, situated at its edge. The main body of the plain covers about 5500&amp;nbsp;km²,&lt;ref name="IUCN"&gt;[http://www.cbd.int/doc/case-studies/inc/cs-inc-iucn-12-en.pdf "Barotse Floodplain, Zambia: local economic dependence on wetland resources."] ''Case Studies in Wetland Valuation #2'': IUCN, May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
but the maximum flooded area is 10 750&amp;nbsp;km² when the floodplains of several tributaries are taken into account,&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/008/n0084e/N0084E03.htm Welcomme, R.L. (Comp.) (1979): ”The inland fisheries of Africa."] CIFA Occas.Pap., (7): 69 p. Published by Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Luena River, Western Zambia|Luena Flats]]. The Barotse Floodplain is the second largest wetland in Zambia after the [[Lake Bangweulu]] system, which differs in having a large permanent lake and swamps, and a much smaller area which dries out annually.&lt;ref name="IUCN"/&gt;

The satellite photo was taken in April 2004 at the peak of the flood, Note that the northern part of the plain, near Lukulu, is less flooded, the land there varies a bit more in height and the water tends to keep to the many river channels.

==Flood levels and timing==
:''See also [[Climate of Zambia]]
The peak of the [[flood]] occurs on the floodplain about 3 months after the peak of the rainy season in January–February. The flood usually peaks in April, and recedes in May to July, when grasses quickly grow on the exposed plain. At the river's lowest water in November the floodplain still contains about 537&amp;nbsp;km² of [[lagoon]]s, [[swamp]]s and channels.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; The flood leaves behind a fertile grey to black soil overlaying the Kalahari sands, enriched by [[silt]] deposited by the flood as well as [[humus]] from vegetation killed by the initial flood, and from decaying aquatic plants left to dry out in the mud. It provides a good soil, but in the late dry season it bakes hard in the heat of the sun.&lt;ref name="IUCN"/&gt;

As the floods recede, water is left behind in lagoons, swamps, and [[oxbow lake]]s.

==Natural environment==
The floodplain is in the [[Ecoregions of Zambia#Zambezian flooded grasslands|Zambezian flooded grasslands]] [[ecoregion]], and is bordered by slightly higher sandy ground on which grow dry grasslands ([[Ecoregions of Zambia#Western Zambezian grasslands|Western Zambezian grasslands]]) with woodland savanna ([[Ecoregions of Zambia#Zambezian Baikiaea woodlands|Zambezian Baikiaea woodlands]]) to the east and south, and patches of evergreen forest ([[Ecoregions of Zambia#Cryptosepalum dry forests|Cryptosepalum dry forests]]) in the north and east.

The flood provides [[aquatic habitat]]s for fish such as [[tigerfish]] and [[bream]], [[Nile crocodile|crocodiles]], [[hippopotamus]],  waterbirds, fish-eating birds, and [[lechwe]], the wading [[antelope]]. After the flood, the plain is a habitat for grazing animals such as [[wildebeest]], [[zebra]], [[tsessebe]] and small antelope such [[oribi]] and [[steenbok]], and their predators.&lt;ref name="IUCN"/&gt;
These herbivores have been displaced in most areas by the cattle grazed by the Lozi, but they have provided a large game reserve on the dry grassland to the west, the [[Liuwa Plain National Park]], once the Litunga's hunting grounds, established as a game reserve by Lewanika in the 19th century. In addition the entire western of the Zambezi within the country is a Game Management Area.

==Human ecology of the plain==
About 250,000 people live on the plain with a similar number of cattle, [[transhumance|migrating]] to grasslands at the edge of the floodplain when the flood arrives. The floodplain is one of the most productive areas for raising cattle in the country.&lt;ref name="IUCN"/&gt;

The Lozi also catch fish, eating about five times as much as the national average. At the height of the flood they use [[fish traps]] and spears for fishing, and they use [[gill net]]s in the lagoons left behind by the falling flood. Fish [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] just before the flood, the first floodwaters are naturally [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] (low in oxygen) which kills most fish, while eggs survive.&lt;ref name="IUCN"/&gt;

The Lozi cultivate crops on the floodplain such as [[maize]], [[rice]], [[sweet potato]], and [[sugar cane]].

November to January are lean months.&lt;ref name="IUCN"/&gt;
Stored produce from the previous growing season is almost used up and in any case would need to be transported during the migration, while the new season's crops and grasses are not yet productive, and at the same time fishing stops for the spawning season. Hunting and trapping animals, which might have filled the gap, is no longer available to most people, and trapping waterbirds is one of the few alternatives to buying flour.

The floodplain determines and dominates the way of life, economy, society and culture of the Lozi, who are skilled boat-builders, paddlers and swimmers.&lt;ref name="IUCN"/&gt;
The annual migration with the flood is celebrated in the [[Kuomboka]] ceremony held at Mongu, capital of Barotseland and its successor, the Western Province.

In the occasional very wet year such as 2005, lives and property are lost in floods on the Barotse Plain. More often, however, it is a very good example of the principle that natural annual flooding by rivers is valuable and productive for wildlife and human populations, while damming rivers to control floods, as has happened with the [[Kafue Flats]], is potentially damaging to the environment.

===Development on or affecting the plain===
Development on the plain has been restricted until now to— 
* the [[canal]] dug in [[Northern Rhodesia|colonial times]] to connect a small harbour at Mongu to the Zambezi's channel in the dry season
*small villages and [[Compound (enclosure)|compounds]] constructed on mounds, such as Lealui
*a few dry season tracks
*[[pontoon ferry|pontoon ferries]] at Sandaula, Libonda and Lukulu
* some intensive rice and sugarcane plantations.

Tight control over access to the floodplain by the Litunga and the homogeneity of the indigenous people have slowed commercial development by outsiders. 
====Barotse Floodplain causeway====&lt;!--NOTE linked from Western province--&gt;
A new project, the '''Mongu-Kalabo road''', will have more far-reaching consequences. Around 2002 construction started of a 46-kilometre [[causeway]] across the centre of the floodplain to take a paved highway from Mongu to Kalabo, via the ferry across the main river channel at Sandaula, which would then be replaced by a 500-metre bridge. Originally intended to be completed in 2006, it has been delayed by the difficulty of building on the floodplain. There is no rock in the region, and the causeway has been built from sand and gravel scooped out from shallow depressions next to it. Higher than usual floods washed away large sections. The contractor was a [[Kuwait]]-based company which acknowledged that conditions were difficult.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccc.gr/PDF/Bulletin/Bulletin74.pdf Bulletin 74 (August 2004),] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326150707/http://www.ccc.gr/PDF/Bulletin/Bulletin74.pdf |date=March 26, 2009 }} [[Consolidated Contractors Company]] of Kuwait.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Times of Zambia]]'' reported that the company underestimated the floodplain environment, and abandoned the contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:Ysf0Jtw2zQ0J:www.times.co.zm/news/archives.cgi%3Fcategory%3D6%26view%3D4.05.07-4.12.07+Mongu+Kalabo+road+OR+highway+site:http://www.times.co.zm&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=14&amp;gl=au Sylvia Mweetwa: "Road financiers to extend agreement."] Ndola: ''Times of Zambia'', 5 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent modifications have been made to raise the road height and to increase the number and size of [[culvert]]s, and this in turn led to funding problems. The road has been completed in 2016. A Chinese contractor finished the 286.9 million US dollars project. The road stretches 34 Kilometres in the Baroste plains with 26 bridges across it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lusakatimes.com/2016/04/08/mongu-kalabo-road-completed/&lt;/ref&gt; No information is available on the impact the structure will have on flood flow patterns, river channels, [[silt]] deposition, or on fish and wildlife movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zambia-travel-guide.com/bradt_guide.asp?bradt=871 Chris McIntyre (2004).

'''Bayhead''' or '''baygall''' is a [[swamp]] habitat where [[bay laurel]]s predominate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fiona Sunquist|author2=Mel Sunquist|author3=Les Beletsky|title=Florida|date=2008|publisher=[[Interlink Books]]|isbn=1566566517|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mUQwqESwg6kC&amp;pg=PP31&amp;dq=strand+swamp#v=onepage&amp;q=strand%20swamp&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bayhead swamp is also known as a '''Forested Seep'''. Many bayhead swamps can be found in margins of creeks with little or no creek banks. Also found in deep depressional areas in flatwoods. The swamps can be described as "distinct wetland communities in the Natural Communities of [[Louisiana]]".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite article|author1=Natural Communities of Louisiana|title=Bayhead Swamp/Forested Seep|publisher=[[Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries]]|url=http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/fact-sheet-community/bayhead-swamp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most bayhead swamps are semi-permanently saturated, or [[flooded]]. Forested seeps are typically mixed with pine-hardwood forests, mostly on hill sides. Some herbs can be found in this area such as various [[Sphagnum]].

Additionally, studies at BATS have shown changes in the [[Revelle factor]], suggesting that the capacity of North Atlantic Ocean surface waters to absorb [[carbon dioxide]] has diminished, even as seawater pCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has kept pace with increasing atmospheric pCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.us-ocb.org/publications/OCB_NEWS_SPRSUM13.pdf|title=The Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) enters its twenty-fifth year of ocean observations in the North Atlantic that illustrate changes in ocean carbon|date=Spring–Summer 2013|publisher=Ocean Carbon and Biogeochemistry News|accessdate=29 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031165041/http://www.us-ocb.org/publications/OCB_NEWS_SPRSUM13.pdf|archive-date=2013-10-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:TS Diagram.jpg|thumb|Visualization of cabbeling in an example Temperature-Salinity diagram. Combining water masses A and B in equal proportions forms water mass C, which has a higher density than either A or B.]]
{{Wiktionary|cabbeling}}
'''Cabbeling''' is when two separate water parcels mix to form a third which sinks below both parents. The combined water parcel is denser than the original two water parcels.

The two parent water parcels may have the same [[density]], but they have different properties; for instance, different [[salinity|salinities]] and [[temperature]]s.&lt;ref name ="EnvironmentalOceanography"&gt;Beer, Tom (1997). Environmental oceanography. Boca Raton: CRC Press. p. 123. {{ISBN|0-8493-8425-7}}, Section 5.4.3 Cabbeling.&lt;/ref&gt; Seawater almost&lt;ref&gt;http://linkingweatherandclimate.com/ocean/waterdensity.php&lt;/ref&gt; always gets more dense if it gets '''either''' slightly colder '''or''' slightly saltier. But medium-warm, medium-salty water can be denser than '''both''' fresher, colder water '''and''' saltier, warmer water; in other words, the equation of state for [[seawater]] is [[monotonic]], but [[non-linear]]. See diagram.

Cabbeling may also occur in fresh water, since [[Properties of water#Density of water and ice|pure water is densest at about 4 °C (39 °F)]]. A mixture of 1&amp;nbsp;°C water and 6&amp;nbsp;°C water, for instance, might have a temperature of 4&amp;nbsp;°C, making it denser than either parent. Ice is also less dense than water, so although ice floats in warm water, meltwater sinks in warm water.

The densification of the new mixed water parcel is a result of a slight contraction upon mixing; a decrease in volume of the combined water parcel.&lt;ref name ="AMSglossary"&gt;[http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=cabbeling&amp;submit=Search AMS glossary],.&lt;/ref&gt;  A new water parcel that has the same [[mass]], but is lower in [[volume]], will be denser.  Denser water sinks or downwells in the otherwise neutral surface of the water body, where the two initial water parcels originated.&lt;ref name="AGUarticle"&gt;[http://europa.agu.org/?uri=/journals/jc/JC092iC05p05448.xml&amp;view=article AGU Thermobaricity, Cabbelling and Water-Mass Conversion]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of term==
The importance of this process in oceanography was first pointed out &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1972|author=Theodore D. Foster|title=An Analysis of the Cabbeling Instability in Sea Water|doi=10.1175/1520-0485(1972)002&lt;0294:AAOTCI&gt;2.0.CO;2|journal=[[w|Journal of Physical Oceanography]]|volume=2|issue=3|page=296|quote="Witte (1902) was evidently the first person to point out the possible importance of this process in the ocean."}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Witte, in a 1902 publication ({{Cite journal|title = Zur Theorie der Stromkabbelungen|last = Witte|first = E.|date = 1902|journal = Gaea, Köln.|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |url=http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/20314/file/E000009258.pdf}}).

The German origin of the term has caused some [[etymological]] confusion and disagreements as to the correct spelling of the term;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = An Analysis of Cabbeling Instability in Sea Water|last = Foster|first = T. D.|date = 1972|journal = Journal of Physical Oceanography|volume = 2|issue = 3|pages = 294-301|doi = 10.1175/1520-0485(1972)002&lt;0294:AAOTCI&gt;2.0.CO;2|pmid = |access-date = |quote="Witte thought that the process would be so effective that the sinking would give rise to a rippled or choppy appearance of the sea surface, which in German nautical terminology has been designated "Kabbelung". There is a not very common English cognate "cobbeling" (Webster's ''Second New International Dictionary'') for this word, but the term does not seem to have been generally accepted by oceanographers. There appears to be a great diversity of opinion about the correct spelling of the English word for this mixing process partly, perhaps, due to different opinions concerning the etymology of the word. One opinion is that the word should be spelled "caballing" meaning "to unite in an intrigue" since the two components conspire to form a more dense mixture. Another opinion is that "Kabbelung" should be anglicized to "cabbeling" and can be used to designate the mixing process itself rather than the appearance of a choppy sea surface which was evidently Witte's intention. Rather than introduce a new term we shall follow Stommel (1960, p.31) and refer to the process as "cabbeling"."}}&lt;/ref&gt; for details, see [[wiktionary:cabbeling|the Wiktionary entry on cabelling]]. Oceanographers generally follow Stommel&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Gulf Stream|last = Stommel|first = H.|publisher = University of California Press|year = 1960|isbn = |location = |pages = 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refer to the process as "cabbeling"{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}.

== High-latitude cabbeling ==

Cabbeling may occur in high incidence in high latitude waters. [[Polar region]] waters are a place where cold and fresh water melting from [[sea ice]] meets warmer, saltier water.  [[Ocean currents]] are responsible for bringing this warmer, saltier water to higher latitudes, especially on the eastern shores of [[Northern Hemisphere]] continents, and on the western shores of [[Southern Hemisphere]] continents.  The phenomenon of cabbeling has been particularly noted in the [[Weddell Sea]] &lt;ref name ="CabbelingCatastrophies"&gt;[http://www.oc.nps.edu/thermobaricity/workshop/cabbel_draft.pdf Cabbeling in the Weddell Sea paper],.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Greenland Sea]].&lt;ref name ="CabbelingGreenlandBasin"&gt;[http://www.ocean-sci-discuss.net/5/507/2008/osd-5-507-2008.pdf Cabbeling in the Greenland Basin paper],.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the rest of the peninsula Santa Ana Hill has as characteristics the contrast of its greenery with the xerophytic vegetation of the area of Paraguaná.

It has three peaks: Santa Ana (highest), Buena Vista and Moruy. In the ascent there are progressive changes in [[climate]] and [[vegetation]]. In the lower parts a dry environment of xerophytic vegetation predominates with thorny forest, while in the higher parts a woody vegetation develops, with leafy trees of 10 to 15 meters in height, with abundant epiphytes, mosses and lichens favored by the high humidity.

Its fauna is predominantly the birds that live in the humid jungle.

The '''Cers''', also called the Narbonnais by those who live southeast of [[Narbonne]], is a very dry wind that is colder during the winter and warmer during the summer. Originating from moist Atlantic air-masses flowing across the [[Toulouse]] area, the Cers is intensified through the [[Lauragais gap]]. Cers winds are frequent across the Aude region in south-western France. Exceptionally red sunsets and [[Lenticular cloud|lenticularis clouds]] usually herald the onset of the Cers. It is closely related to the [[Mistral (wind)|Mistral]], but the term Cers refers specifically to the very strong wind in the bas-[[Languedoc]]. 
The opposite to this wind type is the [[Marin (wind)|Marin]] a south east wind which occurs across the Iberian Peninsula.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2538">In the [[Electricity sector in the United Kingdom|UK electricity system]], a '''data collector''' (DC) is responsible for determining the amount of [[electricity]] supplied so that the customer can be correctly [[Electricity billing in the UK|billed]].

== Half-hourly ==
For [[MPAN#PC|half-hourly metered]] supplies, the HHDC retrieves the energy consumption data from the meter and makes any necessary estimates. The HH data is a history of the customer's electricity consumption for each half-hour period.

== Non-half-hourly  ==
For [[MPAN#PC|non-half-hourly metered]] supplies, the NHHDC determines the consumption by calculating the advance (the difference between the last two meter reads, this is annualised to produce an annual advance (AA), this being the data the supplier will pay on).

The NHHDC is also responsible determining the estimated annual consumption (EAC), which is a forecast for a year ahead. The EAC is initially provided by the supplier, and thereafter forecast based on actual meter readings.

Data from the DC (EAC/ AA's) is provided to the non half hourly data aggregator, which aggregates the individual values provided into a single figure split in a number of ways e.g. geographically or by supplier. This aggregated data is then provided to the Central Systems, maintained by Elexon, to determine the value of energy which has been used by suppliers so that they are able to settle with the distribution network which generated the energy. The process is known as balancing and settlement and is regulated according to the Balancing and Settlement Code (BSC).

==Payment==
A data collection charge is a fee paid to the data collector for determining the energy consumption of the supply. The charge may be shown separately on an electricity bill or it may be incorporated in the electricity supplier's overall charges.

A '''delta ray''' is a [[secondary electron]] with enough energy to escape a significant distance away from the primary radiation beam and produce further ionization"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Radiation Oncology Physics: A Handbook for Teachers and Students|year=2005|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency|location=Vienna|isbn=92-0-107304-6|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/pub1196_web.pdf|editor=Podgorsak, E. B.|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}, and is sometimes used to describe any recoil particle caused by secondary [[ionization]]. The term was coined by [[J. J. Thomson]].

==Characteristics==
[[File:Nuclear particle in a diffusion cloud chamber.png|thumb|Fig. 1: Image taken in the [[Pic du Midi de Bigorre|Pic du Midi]] at 2877&amp;nbsp;m in a Phywe PJ45 cloud chamber (size of surface is 45 x 45 cm). This picture shows the four particles that are detectable in a cloud chamber : proton, electron, muon (probably) and alpha.  Delta rays are seen associated with the proton track.]]

A delta ray is characterized by very fast [[electron]]s produced in quantity by [[alpha particles]] or other fast energetic charged particles knocking orbiting electrons out of [[atoms]]. Collectively, these electrons are defined as delta radiation when they have sufficient energy to ionize further atoms through subsequent interactions on their own. Delta rays appear as branches in the main track of a [[cloud chamber]] (See Figs. 1,2). These branches will appear nearer the start of the track of a heavy charged particle, where more energy is imparted to the ionized electrons.

==Delta rays in particle accelerators==
[[File:Delta electron.png|thumb|Fig. 2: A 3D representation of a delta electron knocked out by a 180 GeV muon, measured with a GridPix detector at the SPS at CERN. The colour indicates the height]]
Otherwise called a knock-on electron, the term "delta ray" is also used in high energy physics to describe single electrons in particle accelerators that are exhibiting characteristic deceleration. In a [[bubble chamber]], electrons will lose their energy more quickly than other particles through [[Bremsstrahlung]] and will create a spiral track due to their small mass and the magnetic field.  The Bremsstrahlung rate is proportional to the square of the acceleration of the electron.

She is especially interested in Indonesian bamboo and [[Malesia]]n bamboo generally, and promotes the cultivation of bamboo for the prevention of [[erosion]].&lt;ref name="akha" /&gt;

Dr. Widjaja recently said, of bamboo as a source of [[biofuel]], that:

{{quote|It is an overwhelming source. Furthermore, it is easy to work with bamboo so research about bamboo-based biofuel should be cheaper.&lt;ref&gt;

''[[Bambusa lako]]'' (Timor black bamboo) was described and separated from the Indonesian black bamboo species ''[[Gigantochloa atroviolacea]]'' by Professor Widjaja in 1997, as its appearance ([[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]) differed.&lt;ref name="Widjaja97"&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Frieze Basilica Aemilia Massimo n1.jpg|thumb| A scene of combat, perhaps between Romulus and Remus, described by some ancient authors as having taken place near the Ficus Ruminalis. Pentelic marble, fragment from the frieze of the Basilica Aemilia, 1st century BC–1st century AD.]]

The '''''Ficus Ruminalis''''' was a wild [[ficus|fig]] tree that had [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious]] and [[Roman mythology|mythological]] significance in [[ancient Rome]]. It stood near the small cave known as the [[Lupercal]] at the foot of the [[Palatine Hill]] and was the spot where according to tradition the floating makeshift cradle of [[Romulus and Remus]] landed on the banks of the [[Tiber River|Tiber]]. There they were nurtured by the [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]] and discovered by [[Faustulus]].&lt;ref&gt; Livy, I.4 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]], ''De lingua latina'' 5.54; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 15.77; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Romulus'' 4.1; [[Servius]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 8.90; [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] 332–333 (edition of Lindsay).&lt;/ref&gt; The tree was sacred to [[Rumina]], one of the [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities|birth and childhood deities]], who protected [[breastfeeding]] in humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Richardson, ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] mentions a [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Ruminus]].&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''[[De Civitate Dei]] 7.11, as cited by [[Arthur Bernard Cook]], "The European Sky-God, III: The Italians," ''Folklore'' 16.3 (1905), p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The wild fig tree was thought to be the male, wild counterpart of the cultivated fig, which was female. In some Roman sources, the wild fig is ''caprificus'', literally "goat fig". The fruit of the fig tree is pendulous, and the tree exudes a milky sap if cut. ''Rumina'' and ''Ruminalis'' ("of Rumina") were connected by some Romans to ''rumis'' or ''ruma'', "teat, breast," but modern linguists think it is more likely related to the names ''Roma'' and ''Romulus,'' which may be based on ''rumon'', perhaps a word for "river" or an archaic name for the Tiber.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''Topographical Dictionary,'' p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
The tree is associated with the legend of [[Romulus and Remus]], and stood where their cradle came to rest on the banks of the [[Tiber River|Tiber]], after their abandonment. The tree offered the twins shade and shelter in their suckling by a [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]], just outside the nearby [[Lupercal]] cave, until their discovery and fostering by the shepherd [[Faustulus]] and his wife [[Acca Larentia]]. Remus was eventually killed by Romulus, who went on to found Rome on the [[Palatine Hill]], above the cave.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, I.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]], ''De lingua latina'' 5.54; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 15.77; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Romulus'' 4.1; [[Servius]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 8.90; [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] 332–333 (edition of Lindsay).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A statue of the she-wolf was supposed to have stood next to the ''Ficus Ruminalis''. In 296 BC, the [[curule aedile]]s Gnaeus and Quintus Ogulnius placed images of Romulus and Remus as babies suckling under her teats.&lt;ref&gt;Livy 10.23.12; [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] 1.79.8.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be this sculpture group that is represented on coins.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''Topographical Dictionary,'' p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]] [[Roman historiography|historian]] [[Livy]] says that the tree still stood in his day,&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] 1.4: ''ubi nunc ficus Ruminalis est.''&lt;/ref&gt; but his younger contemporary [[Ovid]] observes only ''vestigia'', "traces,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' 2.411.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps the stump.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''Topographical Dictionary,'' p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[textual criticism|textually problematic]] passage in [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 15.77.&lt;/ref&gt; seems to suggest that the tree was miraculously transplanted by the [[augur]] [[Attus Navius]] to the [[Comitium]]. This fig tree, however, was the ''Ficus Navia'', so called for the augur. [[Tacitus]] refers to the ''Ficus Navia'' as the ''Arbor Ruminalis'', an identification that suggests it had replaced the original ''Ficus Ruminalis'', either symbolically after the older tree's demise, or literally, having been cultivated as an offshoot. The ''Ficus Navia'' grew from a spot that had been struck by lightning and was thus regarded as [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#arbor felix|sacred]].&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''Topographical Dictionary,'' p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's obscure reference may be to the statue of Attus Navius in front of the [[Curia Hostilia]]:&lt;ref&gt;Festus 168–170 (Lindsay); Dionysius of Halicarnassus 3.71.5.&lt;/ref&gt; he stood with his ''[[lituus]]'' raised in an [[attitude (art)|attitude]] that connected the ''Ficus Navia'' and the accompanying representation of the she-wolf to the ''Ficus Ruminalis'', "as if" the tree had crossed from one space to the other.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''Topographical Dictionary,'' pp. 150–151.&lt;/ref&gt; When the ''Ficus Navia'' drooped, it was taken as a bad omen for Rome. When it died, it was replaced.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 15.77.&lt;/ref&gt; In 58 AD, it withered, but then revived and put forth new shoots.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annales'' 13.58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the archaeology of the Comitium, several irregular stone-lined shafts in rows, dating from [[Roman Republic|Republican]] phases of pavement, may have been apertures to preserve venerable trees during rebuilding programs. Pliny mentions other sacred trees in the [[Forum Romanum|Roman Forum]], with two additional figs. One fig was removed with a great deal of ritual fuss because its roots had undermined a statue of [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]]. A [[relief]] on the [[Plutei of Trajan|''Plutei'' of Trajan]] depicts [[Marsyas]] the satyr, whose statue stood in the Comitium, next to a fig tree that is placed on a [[plinth]], as if it too were a sculpture. It is unclear whether this representation means that sacred trees might be replaced with artificial or pictorial ones.  The apertures were paved over in the time of Augustus, an event that may explain Ovid's ''vestigia''.&lt;ref&gt;Rabun Taylor, "Roman Oscilla: An Assessment," in ''RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics'' 48 (2005), pp. 91–92. Taylor conjectures that ''[[oscilla]]'' were hung from such trees.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Continuum mechanics}}

'''Gas''' is one of [[State of matter|the four fundamental states of matter]] (the others being [[Solid|solid]], [[Liquid|liquid]], and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]). A pure gas may be made up of individual [[atoms]] (e.g. a [[noble gas]] like [[neon]]), [[chemical element|elemental]] molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. [[oxygen]]), or [[chemical compound|compound]] molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. [[carbon dioxide]]). A gas [[mixture]] would contain a variety of pure gases much like the [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and [[gravitational field]]s are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image.

The gaseous state of matter is found between the liquid and plasma states,&lt;ref&gt;This early 20th century discussion infers what is regarded as the plasma state. See page 137 of American Chemical Society, Faraday Society, Chemical Society (Great Britain) ''The Journal of Physical Chemistry, Volume 11'' Cornell (1907).&lt;/ref&gt; the latter of which provides the upper temperature boundary for gases. Bounding the lower end of the temperature scale lie degenerative quantum gases&lt;ref&gt;The work by T. Zelevinski provides another link to latest research about Strontium in this new field of study. See {{cite journal |journal=Physics |title=84Sr—just right for forming a Bose-Einstein condensate |author=Tanya Zelevinsky |url=http://physics.aps.org/articles/v2/94 |volume=2 |page=94 |date=2009 |doi=10.1103/physics.2.94 |bibcode=2009PhyOJ...2...94Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are gaining increasing attention.&lt;ref&gt;for links material on the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] see [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091104140812.htm Quantum Gas Microscope Offers Glimpse Of Quirky Ultracold Atoms].

For a comprehensive listing of these exotic states of matter see [[list of states of matter]].

== Elemental gases ==
The only [[chemical elements]] that are stable [[diatomic]] [[homonuclear]] [[molecules]] at [[standard temperature and pressure|STP]] are [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and two [[halogens]]: [[fluorine]] (F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[chlorine]] (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). When grouped together with the [[monatomic]] [[noble gases]] &amp;ndash; [[helium]] (He), [[neon]] (Ne), [[argon]] (Ar), [[krypton]] (Kr), [[xenon]] (Xe), and [[radon]] (Rn) &amp;ndash; these gases are called "elemental gases".

==Etymology==

The word ''gas'' was first used by the early 17th-century [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[chemist]] [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]].&lt;ref&gt;J. B. van Helmont, ''Ortus medicinae''. …  (Amsterdam, (Netherlands):  Louis Elzevir, 1652 (first edition:  1648)). The word "gas" first appears on [https://books.google.com/books?id=c41nbl8iwrEC&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 58], where he mentions: "… Gas (meum scil. inventum) …" (… gas (namely, my discovery) …). On [https://books.google.com/books?id=c41nbl8iwrEC&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 59], he states: "… in nominis egestate, halitum illum, Gas vocavi, non longe a Chao …" (… in need of a name, I called this vapor "gas", not far from "chaos" …)&lt;/ref&gt; He identified [[carbon dioxide]], the first known gas other than air.&lt;ref name="ley196606"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Helmont's word appears to have been simply a phonetic transcription of the [[Ancient Greek]] word χάος ''[[Chaos (cosmogony)#Terminology|Chaos]]'' – the ''g'' in Dutch being pronounced like ''ch'' in "loch" (voiceless velar fricative, IPA |x]) – in which case Van Helmont was simply following the established [[alchemy|alchemical]] usage first attested in the works of [[Paracelsus]]. According to Paracelsus's terminology, ''chaos'' meant something like "ultra-rarefied water".&lt;ref name=et&gt;{{OEtymD|gas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative story&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Draper |first=John William |title=A textbook on chemistry |date=1861 |publisher=Harper and Sons |location=New York |page=178 |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HKwS7QDh5eMC&amp;rdid=book-HKwS7QDh5eMC&amp;rdot=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that Van Helmont's word is corrupted from ''gahst'' (or ''geist''), signifying a ghost or spirit. This was because certain gases suggested a supernatural origin, such as from their ability to cause death, extinguish flames, and to occur in "mines, bottom of wells, churchyards and other lonely places".

==Physical characteristics==
[[File:Purplesmoke.jpg|right|thumb|border|text-bottom|Drifting [[smoke]] particles provide clues to the movement of the surrounding gas.]]
Because most gases are difficult to observe directly, they are described through the use of four [[physical properties]] or [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] characteristics: [[pressure]], [[volume (thermodynamics)|volume]], [[number of particles]] (chemists group them by [[mole (unit)|moles]]) and temperature. These four characteristics were repeatedly observed by scientists such as [[Robert Boyle]], [[Jacques Charles]], [[John Dalton]], [[Joseph Gay-Lussac]] and [[Amedeo Avogadro]] for a variety of gases in various settings. Their detailed studies ultimately led to a mathematical relationship among these properties expressed by the [[ideal gas law]] (see simplified models section below).

Gas particles are widely separated from one another, and consequently, have weaker intermolecular bonds than liquids or solids. These [[intermolecular forces]] result from electrostatic interactions between gas particles. Like-charged areas of different gas particles repel, while oppositely charged regions of different gas particles attract one another; gases that contain permanently charged [[ions]] are known as [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]s. Gaseous compounds with [[chemical polarity|polar covalent]] bonds contain permanent charge imbalances and so experience relatively strong intermolecular forces, although the molecule while the compound's net charge remains neutral.  Transient, randomly induced charges exist across non-polar [[covalent bond]]s of molecules and electrostatic interactions caused by them are referred to as [[Van der Waals force]]s. The interaction of these intermolecular forces varies within a substance which determines many of the physical properties unique to each gas.&lt;ref&gt;The authors make the connection between molecular forces of metals and their corresponding physical properties. By extension, this concept would apply to gases as well, though not universally. Cornell (1907) pp. 164–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One noticeable exception to this physical property connection is conductivity which varies depending on the state of matter (ionic compounds in water) as described by [[Michael Faraday]] in 1833 when he noted that ice does not conduct a current. See page 45 of John Tyndall's ''Faraday as a Discoverer'' (1868).&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison of ''boiling points'' for compounds formed by ionic and covalent bonds leads us to this conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John S. Hutchinson |url=http://cnx.org/content/col10264/latest/ |title=Concept Development Studies in Chemistry |date=2008 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drifting smoke particles in the image provides some insight into low-pressure gas behavior.

Compared to the other states of matter, gases have low [[density]] and [[viscosity]]. [[Pressure]] and temperature influence the particles within a certain volume. This variation in particle separation and speed is referred to as ''compressibility''. This particle separation and size influences optical properties of gases as can be found in the following [[list of refractive indices]]. Finally, gas particles spread apart or [[diffusion|diffuse]] in order to homogeneously distribute themselves throughout any container.

==Macroscopic==
[[File:CFD Shuttle.jpg|right|thumb|border|text-bottom|Shuttle imagery of re-entry phase]]
{{see also|Gas kinetics}}
When observing a gas, it is typical to specify a frame of reference or [[length scale]]. A ''larger'' length scale corresponds to a [[macroscopic]] or global point of view of the gas. This region (referred to as a volume) must be sufficient in size to contain a large sampling of gas particles. The resulting statistical analysis of this sample size produces the '''"average"''' behavior (i.e. velocity, temperature or pressure) of all the gas particles within the region. In contrast, a ''smaller'' length scale corresponds to a [[microscopic]] or particle point of view.

Macroscopically, the gas characteristics measured are either in terms of the gas particles themselves (velocity, pressure, or temperature) or their surroundings (volume). For example, Robert Boyle studied [[pneumatic chemistry]] for a small portion of his career. One of his experiments related the [[macroscopic]] properties of pressure and volume of a gas. His experiment used a J-tube [[manometer]] which looks like a [[test tube]] in the shape of the letter J. Boyle trapped an [[Inert gas|inert]] gas in the closed end of the test tube with a column of [[mercury (element)|mercury]], thereby making the number of particles and the temperature constant. He observed that when the pressure was increased in the gas, by adding more mercury to the column, the trapped gas' volume decreased (this is known as an [[inverse proportion|inverse]] relationship). Furthermore, when Boyle multiplied the pressure and volume of each observation, the [[Product (mathematics)|product]] was constant. This relationship held for every gas that Boyle observed leading to the law, (PV=k), named to honor his work in this field.

There are many mathematical tools available for analyzing gas properties. As gases are subjected to extreme conditions, these tools become more complex, from the [[Euler equations]]  for inviscid flow to the [[Navier–Stokes equations]]&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, p.501&lt;/ref&gt; that fully account for viscous effects. These equations are adapted to the conditions of the gas system in question. Boyle's lab equipment allowed the use of [[algebra]] to obtain his analytical results. His results were possible because he was studying gases in relatively low pressure situations where they behaved in an "ideal" manner. These ideal relationships apply to safety calculations for a variety of flight conditions on the materials in use. The high technology equipment in use today was designed to help us safely explore the more exotic operating environments where the gases no longer behave in an "ideal" manner. This advanced math, including statistics and [[multivariable calculus]], makes possible the solution to such complex dynamic situations as space vehicle reentry. An example is the analysis of the space shuttle reentry pictured to ensure the material properties under this loading condition are appropriate.  In this flight regime, the gas is no longer behaving ideally.

===Pressure===
{{Main|Pressure}} 
The symbol used to represent ''pressure'' in equations is '''"p"''' or '''"P"''' with SI units of [[pascal (unit)|pascals]].

When describing a container of gas, the term [[pressure]] (or absolute pressure) refers to the average force per unit area that the gas exerts on the surface of the container. Within this volume, it is sometimes easier to visualize the gas particles moving in straight lines until they collide with the container (see diagram at top of the article). The force imparted by a gas particle into the container during this collision is the change in [[momentum]] of the particle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=319–20 |author=J. Clerk Maxwell |title=Theory of Heat |date=1904 |isbn=978-0-486-41735-6 |publisher=Dover Publications |location=Mineola}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a collision only the [[normal (geometry)|normal]] component of velocity changes. A particle traveling parallel to the wall does not change its momentum. Therefore, the average force on a surface must be the average change in [[linear momentum]] from all of these gas particle collisions.

Pressure is the sum of all the [[normal component]]s of force exerted by the particles impacting the walls of the container divided by the surface area of the wall.

===Temperature===
[[File:Nitrogen.ogv|thumb|Air balloon shrinks after submersion in liquid nitrogen]]
{{Main|Thermodynamic temperature}} The symbol used to represent ''temperature'' in equations is ''T'' with SI units of [[kelvin]]s.

The speed of a gas particle is proportional to its [[absolute temperature]]. The volume of the balloon in the video shrinks when the trapped gas particles slow down with the addition of extremely cold nitrogen. The temperature of any [[physical system]] is related to the motions of the particles (molecules and atoms) which make up the [gas] system.&lt;ref&gt;See pages 137–8 of Society, Cornell (1907).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[statistical mechanics]], temperature is the measure of the average kinetic energy stored in a particle. The methods of storing this energy are dictated by the [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of the particle itself ([[Energy level#Molecules|energy modes]]). Kinetic energy added ([[endothermic]] process) to gas particles by way of collisions produces linear, rotational, and vibrational motion. In contrast, a molecule in a solid can only increase its vibrational modes with the addition of heat as the lattice crystal structure prevents both linear and rotational motions. These heated gas molecules have a greater speed range which constantly varies due to constant collisions with other particles. The speed range can be described by the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. Use of this distribution implies [[ideal gas]]es near [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] for the system of particles being considered.

===Specific volume===

{{Main|Specific volume}}
The symbol used to represent ''specific volume'' in equations is '''"v"''' with SI units of cubic meters per kilogram.
{{See also|Gas volume}}

The symbol used to represent '''volume''' in equations is '''"V"''' with SI units of cubic meters.

When performing a [[thermodynamic]] analysis, it is typical to speak of [[intensive and extensive properties]]. Properties which depend on the amount of gas (either by mass or volume) are called ''extensive'' properties, while properties that do not depend on the amount of gas are called ''intensive'' properties. '''Specific volume''' is an example of an ''intensive'' property because it is the ratio of volume occupied by a ''unit of mass'' of a gas that is identical throughout a system at equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=12 |author=Kenneth Wark |title=Thermodynamics |edition=3 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=1977 |isbn=978-0-07-068280-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1000 atoms a gas occupy the same space as any other 1000 atoms for any given temperature and pressure. This concept is easier to visualize for solids such as iron which are [[incompressible]] compared to gases.  Since a gas fills any container in which it is placed, '''volume''' is an ''extensive property''.

===Density===
{{Main|Density}} 
The symbol used to represent '''density''' in equations is '''ρ''' (rho) with SI units of kilograms per cubic meter. This term is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of specific volume.

Since gas molecules can move freely within a container, their mass is normally characterized by '''density'''. Density is the amount of mass per unit volume of a substance, or the inverse of specific volume. For gases, the density can vary over a wide range because the particles are free to move closer together when constrained by pressure or volume. This variation of density is referred to as [[compressibility]]. Like pressure and temperature, density is a [[state variable]] of a gas and the change in density during any process is governed by the laws of thermodynamics. For a [[Fluid statics|static gas]], the density is the same throughout the entire container. Density is therefore a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar quantity]]. It can be shown by '''kinetic theory''' that the density is ''inversely'' proportional to the size of the container in which a fixed mass of gas is confined. In this case of a fixed mass, the density decreases as the volume increases.

==Microscopic==
If one could observe a gas under a powerful microscope, one would see a collection of particles (molecules, atoms, ions, electrons, etc.) without any definite shape or volume that are in more or less random motion. These neutral gas particles only change direction when they collide with another particle or with the sides of the container. In an ideal gas, these collisions are perfectly elastic. This particle or [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] view of a gas is described by the [[Kinetic-molecular theory]]. The assumptions behind this theory can be found in the postulates section of [[Kinetic Theory]].

===Kinetic theory===
{{Main|Kinetic theory of gases}}

'''Kinetic theory''' provides insight into the macroscopic properties of gases by considering their molecular composition and motion. Starting with the definitions of [[momentum]] and [[kinetic energy]],&lt;ref&gt;For assumptions of Kinetic Theory see McPherson, pp.60–61&lt;/ref&gt; one can use the [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation of momentum]] and geometric relationships of a cube to relate macroscopic system properties of temperature and pressure to the microscopic property of kinetic energy per molecule. The theory provides averaged values for these two properties.

The theory also explains how the gas system responds to change. For example, as a gas is heated from absolute zero, when it is (in theory) perfectly still, its [[internal energy]] (temperature) is increased. As a gas is heated, the particles speed up and its temperature rises. This results in greater numbers of collisions with the container per unit time due to the higher particle speeds associated with elevated temperatures.  The pressure increases in proportion to the number of collisions per unit time.

===Brownian motion===
[[File:Diffusion animation.gif|thumb|Random motion of gas particles results in [[diffusion]].]]
{{Main|Brownian motion}} 
Brownian motion is the mathematical model used to describe the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid. The gas particle animation, using pink and green particles, illustrates how this behavior results in the spreading out of gases ([[entropy]]). These events are also described by [[particle|particle theory]].

Since it is at the limit of (or beyond) current technology to observe individual gas particles (atoms or molecules), only theoretical calculations give suggestions about how they move, but their motion is different from Brownian motion because Brownian motion involves a smooth drag due to the frictional force of many gas molecules, punctuated by violent collisions of an individual (or several) gas molecule(s) with the particle. The particle (generally consisting of millions or billions of atoms) thus moves in a jagged course, yet not so jagged as would be expected if an individual gas molecule were examined.

===Intermolecular forces===
[[File:3D model hydrogen bonds in water.svg|left|thumb|border|text-top|When gases are compressed, intermolecular forces like those shown here start to play a more active role.]]
{{Main|van der Waals force|Intermolecular force}}
As discussed earlier, momentary attractions (or repulsions) between particles have an effect on [[gas dynamics]]. In [[physical chemistry]], the name given to these intermolecular forces is ''van der Waals force''. These forces play a key role in determining [[physical properties]] of a gas such as [[viscosity]] and [[Mass flow rate|flow rate]] (see physical characteristics section). Ignoring these forces in certain conditions allows a [[real gas]] to be treated like an [[ideal gas]]. This assumption allows the use of [[ideal gas laws]] which greatly simplifies calculations.

Proper use of these gas relationships requires the [[kinetic-molecular theory]] (KMT). When gas particles experience [[intermolecular force]]s they gradually influence one another as the spacing between them is reduced (the hydrogen bond model illustrates one example). In the absence of any charge, at some point when the spacing between gas particles is greatly reduced they can no longer avoid collisions between themselves at normal gas temperatures. Another case for increased collisions among gas particles would include a fixed volume of gas, which upon heating would contain very fast particles. This means that these ideal equations provide reasonable results except for extremely high pressure (compressible) or high temperature (ionized) conditions. All of these excepted conditions allow energy transfer to take place within the gas system. The absence of these internal transfers is what is referred to as ideal conditions in which the energy exchange occurs only at the boundaries of the system. Real gases experience some of these collisions and intermolecular forces. When these collisions are statistically negligible (incompressible), results from these ideal equations are still meaningful. If the gas particles are compressed into close proximity they behave more like a liquid (see [[fluid dynamics]]).

==Simplified models==
{{Main|Equation of state}}
An ''equation of state'' (for gases) is a mathematical model used to roughly describe or predict the state properties of a gas. At present, there is no single equation of state that accurately predicts the properties of all gases under all conditions. Therefore, a number of much more accurate equations of state have been developed for gases in specific temperature and pressure ranges. The "gas models" that are most widely discussed are "perfect gas", "ideal gas" and "real gas". Each of these models has its own set of assumptions to facilitate the analysis of a given thermodynamic system.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 289–291&lt;/ref&gt; Each successive model expands the temperature range of coverage to which it applies.

===Ideal and perfect gas models===
{{Main|Perfect gas}}
The [[equation of state]] for an ideal or perfect gas is the [[ideal gas law]] and reads
:&lt;math&gt;PV=nRT,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''P'' is the pressure, ''V'' is the volume, ''n'' is amount of gas (in mol units), ''R'' is the [[universal gas constant]],  8.314&amp;nbsp;J/(mol&amp;nbsp;K), and ''T'' is the temperature. Written this way, it is sometimes called the "chemist's version", since it emphasizes the number of molecules ''n''. It can also be written as
:&lt;math&gt;P=\rho R_s T,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;R_s&lt;/math&gt; is the specific gas constant for a particular gas, in units J/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), and ρ = m/V is density. This notation is the "gas dynamicist's" version, which is more practical in modeling of gas flows involving acceleration without chemical reactions.

The ideal gas law does not make an assumption about the specific heat of a gas. In the most general case, the specific heat is a function of both temperature and pressure. If the pressure-dependence is neglected (and possibly the temperature-dependence as well) in a particular application, sometimes the gas is said to be a [[perfect gas]], although the exact assumptions may vary depending on the author and/or field of science.

For an ideal gas, the ideal gas law applies without restrictions on the specific heat. An ideal gas is a simplified "real gas" with the assumption that the [[compressibility factor]] ''Z'' is set to 1 meaning that this pneumatic ratio remains constant. A compressibility factor of one also requires the four state variables to follow the [[ideal gas law]].

This approximation is more suitable for applications in engineering although simpler models can be used to produce a "ball-park" range as to where the real solution should lie. An example where the "ideal gas approximation" would be suitable would be inside a [[Jet engine#Combustors|combustion chamber]] of a [[jet engine]].&lt;ref&gt;John, p.205&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be useful to keep the elementary reactions and chemical dissociations for calculating [[Exhaust gas|emissions]].

===Real gas===
[[File:MountRedoubtEruption.jpg|thumb|21 April 1990 eruption of [[Mount Redoubt]], Alaska, illustrating real gases not in thermodynamic equilibrium.]]
{{Main|Real gas}}
Each one of the assumptions listed below adds to the complexity of the problem's solution. As the density of a gas increases with rising pressure, the intermolecular forces play a more substantial role in gas behavior which results in the ideal gas law no longer providing "reasonable" results. At the upper end of the engine temperature ranges (e.g. combustor sections – 1300 K), the complex fuel particles absorb internal energy by means of rotations and vibrations that cause their specific heats to vary from those of diatomic molecules and noble gases. At more than double that temperature, electronic excitation and dissociation of the gas particles begins to occur causing the pressure to adjust to a greater number of particles (transition from gas to [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]).&lt;ref&gt;John, pp. 247–56&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, all of the thermodynamic processes were presumed to describe uniform gases whose velocities varied according to a fixed distribution. Using a non-equilibrium situation implies the flow field must be characterized in some manner to enable a solution. One of the first attempts to expand the boundaries of the ideal gas law was to include coverage for different [[thermodynamic process]]es by adjusting the equation to read ''pV&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; = constant'' and then varying the ''n'' through different values such as the [[Heat capacity ratio|specific heat ratio]], ''γ''.

'''Real gas effects''' include those adjustments made to account for a greater range of gas behavior:
*[[Compressibility factor|Compressibility effects]] (''Z'' allowed to vary from 1.0)
*Variable [[heat capacity]] (specific heats vary with temperature)
*Van der Waals forces (related to compressibility, can substitute other equations of state)
*[[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|Non-equilibrium thermodynamic effects]]
*Issues with molecular [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] and [[elementary reaction]]s with variable composition.

For most applications, such a detailed analysis is excessive. Examples where real gas effects would have a significant impact would be on the [[Space Shuttle]] [[Atmospheric reentry|re-entry]] where extremely high temperatures and pressures were present or the gases produced during geological events as in the image of the 1990 eruption of [[Mount Redoubt]].

==Historical synthesis==
{{see also|Gas laws}}

===Boyle's law===
[[File:Boyle air pump.jpg|right|thumb|border|text-top|upright|Boyle's equipment]]
{{Main|Boyle's law}}
Boyle's Law was perhaps the first expression of an equation of state. In 1662 [[Robert Boyle]] performed a series of experiments employing a J-shaped glass tube, which was sealed on one end. Mercury was added to the tube, trapping a fixed quantity of air in the short, sealed end of the tube. Then the volume of gas was carefully measured as additional mercury was added to the tube. The pressure of the gas could be determined by the difference between the mercury level in the short end of the tube and that in the long, open end. The image of Boyle's Equipment shows some of the exotic tools used by Boyle during his study of gases.

Through these experiments, Boyle noted that the pressure exerted by a gas held at a constant temperature varies inversely with the volume of the gas.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, pp.52–55&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if the volume is halved, the pressure is doubled; and if the volume is doubled, the pressure is halved. Given the inverse relationship between pressure and volume, the product of pressure (''P'') and volume (''V'') is a constant (''k'') for a given mass of confined gas as long as the temperature is constant. Stated as a formula, thus is:

:&lt;math&gt; PV = k &lt;/math&gt;

Because the before and after volumes and pressures of the fixed amount of gas, where the before and after temperatures are the same both equal the constant ''k'', they can be related by the equation:

&lt;math&gt;\qquad P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Charles's law ===
{{Main|Charles's law}}
In 1787, the French physicist and balloon pioneer, [[Jacques Charles]], found that oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and air expand to the same extent over the same 80 kelvin interval. He noted that, for an ideal gas at constant pressure, the volume is directly proportional to its temperature:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Gay-Lussac's Law===
{{Main|Gay-Lussac's Law}}
In 1802, [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] published results of similar, though more extensive experiments.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, pp.55–60&lt;/ref&gt; Gay-Lussac credited Charles' earlier work by naming the law in his honor. Gay-Lussac himself is credited with the law describing pressure, which he found in 1809. It states that the pressure exerted on a container's sides by an ideal gas is proportional to its temperature.
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{P_1}{T_1}=\frac{P_2}{T_2}    \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Avogadro's law===
{{Main|Avogadro's law}}
In 1811, Amedeo Avogadro verified that equal volumes of pure gases contain the same number of particles. His theory was not generally accepted until 1858 when another Italian chemist Stanislao Cannizzaro was able to explain non-ideal exceptions. For his work with gases a century prior, the number that bears his name [[Avogadro's constant]] represents the number of atoms found in 12&amp;nbsp;grams of elemental carbon-12 (6.022×10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). This specific number of gas particles, at standard temperature and pressure (ideal gas law) occupies 22.40 liters, which is referred to as the [[molar volume]].

Avogadro's law states that the volume occupied by an ideal gas is proportional to the number of [[mole (unit)|moles]] (or molecules) present in the container. This gives rise to the [[molar volume]] of a gas, which at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|STP]] is 22.4 dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (or litres). The relation is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_1}{n_1}=\frac{V_2}{n_2}    \,&lt;/math&gt;

where n is equal to the number of moles of gas (the number of molecules divided by [[Avogadro's Number]]).

===Dalton's law===
[[File:Daltons symbols.gif|thumb|border|text-top|[[John Dalton|Dalton]]'s notation.]]

{{Main|Dalton's law}}
In 1801, [[John Dalton]] published the '''Law of Partial Pressures''' from his work with ideal gas law relationship: The pressure of a mixture of non reactive gases is equal to the sum of the pressures of all of the constituent gases alone. Mathematically, this can be represented for ''n'' species as:

: '''Pressure&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt; = Pressure&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + Pressure&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + Pressure&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;'''

The image of Dalton's journal depicts symbology he used as shorthand to record the path he followed. Among his key journal observations upon mixing unreactive "elastic fluids" (gases) were the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=72, 77–78 |author=John P. Millington |title=John Dalton |date=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Unlike liquids, heavier gases did not drift to the bottom upon mixing.
*Gas particle identity played no role in determining final pressure (they behaved as if their size was negligible).

==Special topics==

===Compressibility===
[[File:Compressibility Factor of Air 75-200 K.png|right|thumb|border|text-top|Compressibility factors for air.]]
{{Main|Compressibility factor}}
Thermodynamicists use this factor (''Z'') to alter the ideal gas equation to account for compressibility effects of real gases. This factor represents the ratio of actual to ideal specific volumes. It is sometimes referred to as a "fudge-factor" or correction to expand the useful range of the ideal gas law for design purposes. ''Usually'' this ''Z'' value is very close to unity. The compressibility factor image illustrates how Z varies over a range of very cold temperatures.

===Reynolds number===
{{Main|Reynolds number}}
In fluid mechanics, the Reynolds number is the ratio of inertial forces (''v&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;ρ'') to viscous forces (''μ/L''). It is one of the most important dimensionless numbers in fluid dynamics and is used, usually along with other dimensionless numbers, to provide a criterion for determining dynamic similitude. As such, the Reynolds number provides the link between modeling results (design) and the full-scale actual conditions. It can also be used to characterize the flow.

===Viscosity===
[[File:Vortex-street-1.jpg|thumb|upright|Satellite view of weather pattern in vicinity of [[Juan Fernández Islands|Robinson Crusoe Islands]] on 15 September 1999, shows a turbulent cloud pattern called a [[Kármán vortex street]]]]
{{Main|Viscosity}}
Viscosity, a physical property, is a measure of how well adjacent molecules stick to one another. A solid can withstand a shearing force due to the strength of these sticky intermolecular forces. A fluid will continuously deform when subjected to a similar load. While a gas has a lower value of viscosity than a liquid, it is still an observable property. If gases had no viscosity, then they would not stick to the surface of a wing and form a boundary layer. A study of the [[delta wing]] in the [[Schlieren photography|Schlieren]] image reveals that the gas particles stick to one another (see Boundary layer section).

===Turbulence===
[[File:Schlierenfoto Mach 17 Delta - NASA.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Delta wing]] in wind tunnel. The shadows form as the indices of refraction change within the gas as it compresses on the leading edge of this wing.]]
{{Main|Turbulence}}
In fluid dynamics, '''turbulence''' or turbulent flow is a flow regime characterized by chaotic, stochastic property changes. This includes low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid variation of pressure and velocity in space and time. The satellite view of weather around Robinson Crusoe Islands illustrates one example.

===Boundary layer===
{{Main|Boundary layer}}
Particles will, in effect, "stick" to the surface of an object moving through it. This layer of particles is called the '''boundary layer'''. At the surface of the object, it is essentially static due to the friction of the surface. The object, with its boundary layer is effectively the new shape of the object that the rest of the molecules "see" as the object approaches. This boundary layer ''can'' separate from the surface, essentially creating a new surface and completely changing the flow path. The classical example of this is a [[Stall (flight)#Formal definition|stalling airfoil]]. The delta wing image clearly shows the boundary layer thickening as the gas flows from right to left along the leading edge.

===Maximum entropy principle===
{{Main|Principle of maximum entropy}}
As the total number of degrees of freedom approaches infinity, the system will be found in the [[macrostate]] that corresponds to the highest [[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]. In order to illustrate this principle, observe the skin temperature of a frozen metal bar. Using a thermal image of the skin temperature, note the temperature distribution on the surface. This initial observation of temperature represents a "[[microstate]]". At some future time, a second observation of the skin temperature produces a second microstate. By continuing this observation process, it is possible to produce a series of microstates that illustrate the thermal history of the bar's surface. Characterization of this historical series of microstates is possible by choosing the macrostate that successfully classifies them all into a single grouping.

===Thermodynamic equilibrium===
{{Main|Thermodynamic equilibrium}}
When energy transfer ceases from a system, this condition is referred to as thermodynamic equilibrium. Usually this condition implies the system and surroundings are at the same temperature so that heat no longer transfers between them. It also implies that external forces are balanced (volume does not change), and all chemical reactions within the system are complete. The timeline varies for these events depending on the system in question. A container of ice allowed to melt at room temperature takes hours, while in semiconductors the heat transfer that occurs in the device transition from an on to off state could be on the order of a few nanoseconds.

'''Glass microspheres''' are [[microscopic]] spheres of [[glass]] manufactured for a wide variety of uses in [[research]], [[medicine]], [[consumer goods]] and various industries. Glass microspheres are usually between 1 and 1000 micrometers in diameter, although the sizes can range from 100 nanometers to 5 millimeters in diameter. Hollow glass microspheres, sometimes termed '''microballoons''' or '''glass bubbles''', have diameters ranging from 10 to 300 [[micrometre|micrometer]]s.

Hollow spheres are used as a lightweight [[aggregate (composite)|filler]] in [[composite material]]s such as [[syntactic foam]] and [[lightweight concrete]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ces.clemson.edu/earnest/0699pages/16.htm "Whatever Floats Your Boat, Clemson Student Chapter of the American Society of Civil Engineers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131035333/http://www.ces.clemson.edu/earnest/0699pages/16.htm |date=2009-01-31 }}. ces.clemson.edu&lt;/ref&gt; Microballoons give syntactic foam its light weight, low [[thermal conductivity]], and a resistance to [[compressive stress]] that far exceeds that of other foams.&lt;ref&gt;Common Microballoons have a density of 0.15 to 0.20 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, with an isostatic crush strength of 300 to 500 psi. Denser, high strength forms offer 0.38 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with 5500 psi strength, and 0.6 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (still offering considerable flotation) with 18,000 psi crush pressure.&lt;/ref&gt;  These properties are exploited in the hulls of [[submersible]]s and deep-sea oil drilling equipment, where other types of foam would [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implode]].  Hollow spheres of other materials create syntactic foams with different properties: ceramic balloons e.g. can make a light syntactic [[aluminium]] foam.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Erikson  (1 January 1999). [https://web.archive.org/web/20050604075250/http://www.memagazine.org/backissues/january99/features/foams/foams.html Foams on the Cutting Edge]. Mechanical Engineering-CIME&lt;/ref&gt;

Hollow spheres also have uses ranging from storage and slow release of [[pharmaceutical]]s and [[radioactive tracer]]s to research in controlled [[hydrogen storage|storage]] and release of [[hydrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;J.E. Shelby, M.M. Hall, and F.C. Raszewski (2007). [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/product.biblio.jsp?query_id=0&amp;page=0&amp;osti_id=918691 A radically new method for hydrogen storage in hollow glass microspheres] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604151559/http://www.osti.gov/bridge/product.biblio.jsp?query_id=0&amp;page=0&amp;osti_id=918691 |date=2011-06-04 }}.  DOE Technical Report FG26-04NT42170.&lt;/ref&gt; Microspheres are also used in composites to fill polymer resins for specific characteristics such as weight, sandability and sealing surfaces. When making surfboards for example, shapers seal the [[Polystyrene#Expanded polystyrene|EPS]] foam blanks with epoxy and microballoons to create an impermeable and easily sanded surface upon which fiberglass laminates are applied.

Glass microspheres can be made by heating tiny droplets of dissolved [[sodium silicate|water glass]] in a process known as [[Ultrasonic nozzle|ultrasonic spray pyrolysis]] (USP), and properties can be improved somewhat by using a chemical treatment to remove some of the [[sodium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1557/JMR.1996.0368|bibcode=1996JMatR..11.2908I|title=Characterization of hydrated silicate glass microballoons|date=2011|last1=Isobe|first1=Hiroshi|last2=Tokunaga|first2=Ichiro|last3=Nagai|first3=Noriyoshi|last4=Kaneko|first4=Katsumi|journal=Journal of Materials Research|volume=11|issue=11|pages=2908}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sodium depletion has also allowed hollow glass microspheres to be used in chemically sensitive resin systems, such as long pot life epoxies or non-blown polyurethane composites

Additional functionalities, such as silane coatings, are commonly added to the surface of hollow glass microspheres to increase the matrix/microspheres interfacial strength (the common failure point when stressed in a tensile manner).

Microspheres made of high quality optical glass, can be produced for research on the field of [[Optical microcavity|optical resonators or cavities]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Optical resonator]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Glass microspheres are also produced as waste product in coal-fired power stations. In this case the product would be generally termed "[[cenosphere]]" and carry an aluminosilicate chemistry (as opposed to the sodium silica chemistry of engineered spheres). Small amounts of silica in the coal are melted and as they rise up the chimneystack, expand and form small hollow spheres. These spheres are collected together with the ash, which is pumped in a water mixture to the resident ash dam. Some of the particles do not become hollow and sink in the ash dams, while the hollow ones float on the surface of the dams. They become a nuisance, especially when they dry, as they become airborne and blow over into surrounding areas.

== Application ==
Microspheres have been used to produce focal regions, known as photonic nanojets and whose sizes are below the micrometric scale. Previous research has demonstrated experimentally and with simulations the use of microspheres in order to increase the signal intensity obtained in different experiments. A confirmation of the photonic jet in the microwave scale, observing the backscattering enhancement that occurred when metallic particles were introduced in the focus area.  A measurable enhancement of the backscattered light in the visible range was obtained when a gold nanoparticle was placed inside the photonic nanojet region produced by a dielectric microsphere with a 4.4 μm diameter. A use of nanojets produced by transparent microspheres in order to excite optical active materials, under [[Photon upconversion|upconversion]] processes with different numbers of excitation photons, has been analyzed as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pérez-Rodríguez|first=C.|author2=Imanieh, M.H. |author3=Martín, L.L |author4=Ríos, S. |author5=Martín, I.R. |author6= Yekta, Bijan Eftekhari |title=Study of the focusing effect of silica microspheres on the upconversion of Er3+–Yb3+ codoped glass ceramics|journal=Journal of Alloys and Compounds|date=November 2013|volume=576|pages=363–368|doi=10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.05.222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monodisperse glass microspheres''' have high sphericity and a very tight particle size distribution, often with CV&lt;10% and specification of &gt;95% of particles in size range. Monodisperse glass particles are often used as spacers in adhesives and coatings, such as bond line spacers in epoxies. Just a small amount of spacer grade monodisperse microspheres can create a controlled gap, as well as define and maintain specified bond line thickness. Spacer grade particles can also be used as calibration standards and tracer particles for qualifying medical devices. High quality spherical glass microspheres are often used in gas plasma displays, automotive mirrors, electronic displays, flip chip technology, filters, microscopy, and electronic equipment.

Other applications include [[syntactic foam]]s&lt;ref&gt;H. S. Kim and Mahammad Azhar Khamis, “Fracture and impact behaviour of hollow micro-sphere/epoxy resin composites”, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, Vol 32A, No 9, pp. 1311-1317, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and particulate [[composite material|composites]] and reflective paints.

==Dispensing of microspheres==
Dispensing of microspheres can be a difficult task. When utilizing microspheres as a filler for standard mixing and dispensing machines, a breakage rate of up to 80% can occur, depending upon factors such as pump choice, material viscosity, material agitation, and temperature. Customized dispensers for microsphere-filled materials may reduce the microsphere breakage rate to a minimal amount. A [[progressive cavity pump]] is the pump of choice for dispensing materials with microspheres, which can reduce microsphere breakage as much as 80%.[sources needed]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28518">'''Global citizenship education''' ('''GCE''') is a form of [[civics|civic learning]] that involves students' active participation in projects that address [[global issue|global]] [[global issue|issue]]s of a social, political, economic, or environmental nature. The two main elements of GCE are '[[global consciousness]]';  the moral or ethical aspect of global issues, and 'global competencies', or skills meant to enable learners to participate in changing and developing the world. The promotion of GCE was a response by governments and NGOs to the emergence of [[supranational institution]], [[trade bloc|regional economic blocs]], and the development of [[information and communications technology|information and]] [[information and communications technology|communications technologies]]. These have allresulted in the emergence of a more globally oriented and collaborative approach to education. GCE addresses themes such as peace and human rights, intercultural understanding, citizenship education, respect for diversity and tolerance, and inclusiveness.Schools in action, global citizens for sustainable development: a guide for students

== Definition and origins ==
[[Global citizenship]] consists of voluntary practices oriented to human rights, social justice, and environmentalism at the local, regional, and global level. Unlike national citizenship, global citizenship does not denote any legal status  or allegiance to an actual form of government.  The emergence of regional economic blocs, supra-national political institutions such as the [[European Union|European]] [[European Union|Union]], and the advancement of ICTs, has caused governments to try to prepare national populations to be competitive in the global jobs market. This has led to the introduction of global citizenship education  programs at primary, secondary, and tertiary level, but also at independent [[NGO]]s, [[grass roots]] organizations, and other large scale educational organizations, such as the [[International Baccalaureate Organization]] and [[UNESCO]].

The most important features of global citizenship education are voluntary action that can extend from local to international collectives; the practice of cultural empathy; and a focus on active participation in social and political life at the local and global level. In the late 1990s, [[OXFAM]] UK designed a curriculum for global citizenship education
which stressed "the 'active' role of global citizens".In this approach, individuals and groups both inside and outside the educational sector might take action that addresses human rights, trade, poverty, health, and environmental issues, for example. This is sometimes called the 'global consciousness' aspect of GCE. However, organizations such as UNESCO have also begun to emphasize 'global competencies', including science and technology into their GCE [[curricula]], to "strengthen linkages between education and economic development".

== Emergence and development ==
In the present era of [[globalization]], the recognition of global interdependence on the part of the general public has led to a higher degree of interest in global citizenship in education. No Though modern schooling may have been oriented to education suitable for the nation-state throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, in the 21st century, citizenship is understood in global terms, so that schooling might improve individual nations' global competitiveness. Many universities worldwide have responded to the need for a globally oriented education by sending their students to study abroad in increasing numbers, and some have announced that this will soon become a mandatory degree requirement.

Many governments also now promote GCE for the cohesion of society. The large numbers of people migrating across national borders means that the  diversity of ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups, "has raised [...] complex and difficult questions about citizenship, human rights, democracy, and education".   In addition, global issues related to [[sustainability]], such as the world's future energy arrangements, have also been incorporated into the domain of global citizenship education.

== Competences ==
While GCE can take different forms, it has some common elements, which include fostering in learners the following competences:&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2014. ''Global Citizenship Education. Preparing Learners for the Challenges of the 21st Century''. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002428/242887e.pdf|title=Level-setting and recognition of learning outcomes: The use of level descriptors in the twenty-first century|last=Keevy|first=James|last2=Chakroun|first2=Borhene|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100138-3|location=|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An attitude supported by an understanding of multiple levels of identity, and the potential for a collective identity that transcends individual cultural, religious, ethnic or other differences (such as a sense of belongingness to common humanity, and respect for diversity);
* A deep knowledge of global issues and universal values such as justice, equality, dignity and respect (such as understanding of the process of globalization, interdependence/ interconnectedness, the global challenges which cannot be adequately or uniquely addressed by nation states, sustainability as the main concept of the future);
* Cognitive skills to think critically, systemically and creatively, including adopting a multi-perspective approach that recognizes different dimensions, perspectives and angles of issues (such as reasoning and problem-solving skills supported by a multi-perspective approach);
* Non-cognitive skills, including social skills such as empathy and con ict resolution, and communication skills and aptitudes for networking and interacting with people of different backgrounds, origins, cultures and perspectives (such as global empathy, sense of solidarity); and
* Behavioural capacities to act collaboratively and responsibly to find global solutions to global challenges, and to strive for the collective good.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Pedagogy ==

Most educators agree that "global citizenship is a learned and nurtured behavior",&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant, 2010:442&lt;/ref&gt; and the most widely used classroom strategy for developing global skills is project-based learning. This pedagogical technique can be utilized in the case of almost any school subject, "[and] is the primary pedagogical strategy in the discourse of global competencies. Educators see it as an important method for developing the tools- technical and emotional- for success in the global society".&lt;ref&gt;Dill, 2013:14&lt;/ref&gt; With the aim of nurturing students' potential to be both learners and citizens, the project-based approach has been used successfully in community-based learning, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Melaville &amp; Berg et al, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important pedagogical feature of GCE is learning through communicative practices outside the classroom that "harness […] the educational force of the wider culture".&lt;ref name="Catalano, 2013:3"&gt;Catalano, 2013:3&lt;/ref&gt; If students are encouraged "to see themselves as political agents",&lt;ref name="Catalano, 2013:3"/&gt; educators assume they are more likely to acquire the knowledge, skills and abilities that enable them to  become agents of change.&lt;ref&gt;Catalano, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Another important element of the student-centered participatory nature of GCED, is that students, through their engagement with others via [[Social network services|Social Network Services]], create their own forms of global citizenship through dialogue, learning, and action.&lt;ref&gt;Bourn, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This is  an important element, for example, in the activities of grassroots organizations like 'GIN' ([[Global Issues Network]]), which involves students and teachers in projects that address global issues such as human rights, trade rules, and deforestation.&lt;ref name="Dill, 2013"&gt;Dill, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Such student-driven, student-led projects combine both the 'global consciousness' and 'global competence' aspects of GCED.

;'Global consciousness' and 'global competence'

Organizations implementing GCE programs, such as UNESCO, now emphasize the importance of expanding both students' 'global consciousness' and 'global competence'.&lt;ref name="Dill, 2013"/&gt; 'Global consciousness' represents the ethical or moral dimension of global citizenship, whereas 'global competence' "features a blend of the technical-rational and the dispositional or attitudinal".&lt;ref&gt;Dill, 2013:11&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some view global consciousness and global competence as being closely related.&lt;ref&gt;Grudinski Hall, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The OECD, for instance, focuses on global competencies called 'psychosocial resources', of which there are three main types: "using tools interactively (technology and language skills), interacting in heterogeneous groups (cooperation, empathy), and acting autonomously (realizing one's identity, conducting life plans, defending and asserting rights".&lt;ref&gt;Dill, 2013: 12&amp;ndash;13&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key learner attributes ==
GCE identifies three learner attributes, which refer to the traits and qualities that global citizenship education aims to develop in learners and correspond to the key learning outcomes mentioned earlier. These are: informed and critically literate; socially connected and respectful of diversity; ethically responsible and engaged. The three learner attributes draw on a review of the literature and of citizenship education conceptual frameworks, a review of approaches and curricula, as well as technical consultations and recent work by UNESCO on global citizenship education.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002329/232993e.pdf|title=Global Citizenship Education: topics and learning objectives|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100102-4|location=|pages=20–21, 44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Informed and critically literate ===
Learners develop their understanding of the world, global themes, governance structures and systems, including politics, history and economics; understand the rights and responsibilities of individuals and groups (for example, women’s and children’s rights, indigenous rights, corporate social responsibility); and, recognise the interconnectedness of local, national and global issues, structures and processes. Learners develop the skills of critical inquiry (for example, where to find information and how to analyse and use evidence), [[media literacy]] and an understanding of how information is mediated and communicated. They develop their ability to inquire into global themes and issues (for example, globalisation, interdependence, migration, peace and conflict, sustainable development) by planning investigations, analysing data and communicating their findings. A key issue is the way in which language is used and, more specifically, how critical literacy is affected by the dominance of the English language and how this influences non-English speakers’ access to information.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Socially connected and respectful of diversity ===
Learners learn about their identities and how they are situated within multiple relationships (for example, family, friends, school, local community, country), as a basis for understanding the global dimension of citizenship. They develop an understanding of difference and diversity (for example, culture, language, gender, sexuality, religion), of how beliefs and values influence people’s views about those who are different, and of the reasons for, and impact of, inequality and discrimination. Learners also consider common factors that transcend difference, and develop the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes required for respecting difference and living with others.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Ethically responsible and engaged ===
Learners explore their own beliefs and values and those of others. They understand how beliefs and values inform social and political decision-making at local, national, regional and global levels, and the challenges for governance of contrasting and conflicting beliefs and values. Learners also develop their understanding of social justice issues in local, national, regional and global contexts and how these are interconnected. Ethical issues (for example, relating to [[climate change]], [[consumerism]], [[Economic globalization|economic globalisation]], [[fair trade]], migration, poverty and wealth, sustainable development, [[terrorism]], war) are also addressed. Learners are expected to reflect on ethical conflicts related to social and political responsibilities and the wider impact of their choices and decisions. Learners also develop the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to care for others and the environment and to engage in civic action. These include compassion, empathy, collaboration, dialogue, social entrepreneurship and active participation. They learn about opportunities for engagement as citizens at local, national and global levels, and examples of individual and collective action taken by others to address global issues and social injustice.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== High Resolves, Australia ===
[https://highresolves.org/ High Resolves] is a secondary school educational initiative (implemented by the FYA, the only national, independent non-profit organisation for young people in Australia) consisting of a Global Citizenship Programme for Year 8 students and a Global Leadership Programme for Year 9 and 10 students. It aims to enable students to consider their personal role in developing their society as a global community through workshops, simulations, leadership skills training and hands-on action projects.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== ''Developing the global dimension in the school curriculum,'' England ===
In England, the Department for Education and Skills produced ''Developing the global dimension in the school curriculum'', a publication for head teachers, teachers, senior managers and those with responsibility for curriculum development. It aims to show how the global dimension can be integrated in the curriculum and across the school. It provides examples of how to integrate the global dimension from age 3 to age 16, outlining eight key concepts – global citizenship, conflict resolution, diversity, human rights, interdependence, sustainable development, values and perceptions, and social justice. For example, it gives guidance for the promotion of personal, social and emotional development of the youngest learners through discussion of photographs of children from around the world, activities, stories, and discussion of different places children have visited.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Activate, South Africa ===
'''Activate''' is a network of young leaders in South Africa which aims to bring about change though creative solutions to problems in society. Youth from all backgrounds and provinces in the country participate in a two-year programme. In the first year, there are three residential training programmes, working on a particular task. In the second year, participants form action groups on specific tasks, taking their work into the public domain. In one example, an Activator describes how he works in his local community to discourage young people away from joining gangs and engaging in substance abuse. He draws on his own negative experiences with gangs and drugs, having served seven years in jail. On being interviewed, he states: “My vision for South Africa is to see young people standing up and becoming role models... Be yourself, be real and pursue your dreams”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.activateleadership.co.za/blog/5-mins-with-fernando#sthash.dRCXMqPx.dpuf|title=Activate Change Drivers|last=|first=|date=|website=Activate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Council for Global Citizenship Education, India (and global) ===
[https://www.globalcitizenshipfoundation.org/council-for-gced Council for Global Citizenship Education] — part of the [https://www.globalcitizenshipfoundation.org/ Global Citizenship Foundation], a non-profit organisation based in India — is an initiative for schools to adopt a participatory whole-school approach to global citizenship education. The initiative fosters continuous professional development (CPD) of educators; teacher led contextualization, design, and development of GCED curriculum; engagement of children through the '[https://www.globalcitizenshipfoundation.org/hundred-acts 100 Acts of Global Citizenship]' School Challenge; and community through a Global Citizenship Festival at '100 Acts of Global Citizenship' participating schools. It has also been implemented in 10 States of India.

=== Peace First, United States and Colombia ===
Peace First, a non-profit organisation based in the United States, has a programme in which youth volunteers work with children to design and implement community projects in a participatory way. The rationale is that children are natural creative thinkers and problem solvers. The programme focuses on developing social and emotional skills of self- awareness, empathy, inclusivity and relationships. It has also been implemented in rural areas of Colombia through a partnership between local governments and Colombian NGOs. Peace First has additionally developed a curriculum that can be used in schools. It addresses themes such as friendship, fairness, cooperation, con ict resolution and consequences of actions through experiential activities and cooperative games. For example, 1st graders learn about communicating their feelings, 3rd graders develop skills and awareness around communication and cooperation, 4th graders practice courage and taking a stand and 5th graders explore how to resolve and de-escalate conflicts.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation, Japan (and global) ===
'''Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation''' is an education-services organization that provides capstone education programs free of charge to engineering students and other stakeholders. These programs are intended to complement—but not to replace—coursework required by academic degree programs of study. The programs are educational opportunities, and students are not paid money for their participation. All correspondence among members is completed via e-mail, and all meetings are held via Skype, with English as the language of instruction and publication. Students and other stakeholders are never asked to travel or leave their geographic locations, and are encouraged to publish organizational documents in their personal, primary languages, when English is a secondary language.

== Connection to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) ==
{{Main|Education for sustainable development}}

GCE and ESD pursue the same vision: It is all about empowering learners of all ages to become proactive contributors to a more just, peaceful, tolerant, inclusive and sustainable world. Both GCED and ESD:
* focus not only on the content and outcome of what is learned, but also on the process of how it is learned and in what type of environment it is learned.
* emphasize action, change and transformation.
* place importance on acquiring values and attitudes relevant to addressing global challenges.
* foster skills for collaboration, communication and critical thinking.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002463/246352e.pdf|title=Schools in action, global citizens for sustainable development: a guide for students|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100179-6|location=|pages=10, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objections ==

Some fundamentalist critics believe GCE might undermine religious education and promote secular values.&lt;ref name="Schattle, 2008"&gt;Schattle, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Others are concerned that the pedagogical approach of most global citizenship education curricula are too often produced in particular Northern, Western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Andreotti and de Souza, 2012:18&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics claim that GCE curricula promote values that are too individualistic.&lt;ref name="Dill, 2013"/&gt; Dill,&lt;ref&gt;2013&lt;/ref&gt; for example, claims that "the majority of the world experiences social and communal life not in terms of isolated individuals, but as collective identities and traditions. For many of these groups, the dominant forms of global citizenship education and its moral order will be experienced as coercive and unjust',&lt;ref&gt;Dill, 2013:33&lt;/ref&gt; so 'global' citizenship curriculum should be seen as a local practice, "which diverse cultures will conceptualize and construct differently".&lt;ref&gt;Myers, 2006:13&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20536">Early writing on mineralogy, especially on gemstones, comes from ancient [[Babylonia]], the ancient [[Greco-Roman]] world, ancient and medieval [[History of China|China]], and [[Sanskrit]] texts from [[History of India|ancient India]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 637"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 637.&lt;/ref&gt;  Books on the subject included the [[Naturalis Historia]] of [[Pliny the Elder]] which not only described many different minerals but also explained many of their properties.  The [[German Renaissance]] specialist [[Georgius Agricola]] wrote works such as ''[[De re metallica]]'' (''On Metals'', 1556) and ''[[De Natura Fossilium]]'' (''On the Nature of Rocks'', 1546) which began the scientific approach to the subject.  Systematic scientific studies of minerals and rocks developed in post-[[Renaissance]] Europe.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 636"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 636.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern study of mineralogy was founded on the principles of [[crystallography]] and [[microscopic]] study of rock sections with the invention of the [[microscope]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 636"/&gt;

==Europe and the Middle East==

[[File:Theophrastus2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Theophrastus]]]]
The ancient Greek writers [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) and [[Theophrastus]] (370–285 BC) were the first in the Western tradition to write of minerals and their properties, as well as [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] explanations for them. The [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] Aristotle wrote his ''[[Meteorologica]]'', and in it theorized that all the known substances were composed of water, air, earth, and fire, with the properties of dryness, dampness, heat, and cold.&lt;ref name="bandy i"&gt;Bandy, i (Forward).&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek philosopher and [[botanist]] Theophrastus wrote his ''De Mineralibus'', which accepted Aristotle's view, and divided minerals into two categories: those affected by heat and those affected by dampness.&lt;ref name="bandy i"/&gt;

The metaphysical emanation and exhalation (''anathumiaseis'') theory of Aristotle included early speculation on earth sciences including mineralogy. According to his theory, while metals were supposed to be congealed by means of moist exhalation, dry gaseous exhalation (''pneumatodestera'') was the efficient material cause of minerals found in the Earth's soil.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 636 637"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 636-637.&lt;/ref&gt; He postulated these ideas by using the examples of moisture on the surface of the earth (a moist vapor 'potentially like water'), while the other was from the earth itself, pertaining to the attributes of hot, dry, smoky, and highly combustible ('potentially like fire').&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 636 637"/&gt; Aristotle's metaphysical theory from times of antiquity had wide-ranging influence on similar theory found in later medieval Europe, as the historian Berthelot notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The theory of exhalations was the point of departure for later ideas on the generation of metals in the earth, which we meet with [[Proclus]], and which reigned throughout the [[middle ages]].''&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 637"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Asbestos with muscovite.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Fibrous asbestos on [[muscovite]]]]

Ancient Greek terminology of minerals has also stuck through the ages with widespread usage in modern times. For example, the Greek word [[asbestos]] (meaning 'inextinguishable', or 'unquenchable'), for the unusual mineral known today containing [[fibrous]] structure.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 656"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 656.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient historians [[Strabo]] (63 BC–19 AD) and [[Pliny the Elder]] (23–79 AD) both wrote of asbestos, its qualities, and its origins, with the [[Hellenistic]] belief that it was of a type of [[vegetable]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 656"/&gt; Pliny the Elder listed it as a mineral common in India, while the historian [[Yu Huan]] (239–265 AD) of China listed this 'fireproof cloth' as a product of ancient [[Rome]] or [[Arabia]] (Chinese: [[Daqin]]).&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 656"/&gt; Although documentation of these minerals in ancient times does not fit the manner of modern scientific classification, there was nonetheless extensive written work on early mineralogy.

===Pliny the Elder===
[[File:Rough diamond.jpg|left|thumb|150px|octahedral shape of diamond.]]
[[File:Baltic_Amber_necklace_with_insects_inclusions.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] amber necklace with trapped insects ]]
For example, Pliny devoted five entire volumes of his work [[Naturalis Historia]] (77 AD) to the classification of "earths, metals, stones, and gems".&lt;ref name="ramsdell 164"&gt;Ramsdell, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; He not only describes many minerals not known to [[Theophrastus]], but discusses their applications and properties. He is the first to correctly recognise the origin of [[amber]] for example, as the fossilised remnant of tree resin from the observation of insects trapped in some samples. He laid the basis of [[crystallography]] by discussing [[crystal habit]], especially the [[octahedral]] shape of [[diamond]]. His discussion of mining methods is unrivalled in the ancient world, and includes, for example, an [[eye-witness]] account of [[gold mining]] in northern [[Spain]], an account which is fully confirmed by modern research.

However, before the more definitive foundational works on mineralogy in the 16th century, the ancients recognized no more than roughly 350 minerals to list and describe.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 646"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 646.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jabir and Avicenna===
With philosophers such as [[Proclus]], the theory of [[Neoplatonism]] also spread to the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] during the [[Middle Ages]], providing a basis for metaphysical ideas on mineralogy in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Middle East]] as well. The medieval [[Islamic science|Islamic scientists]] expanded upon this as well, including the [[Persian people|Persian]] scientist [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (ابوعلى سينا/پورسينا) (980-1037 AD), also known as ''Avicenna'', who rejected [[alchemy]] and the earlier notion of [[Greek philosophy|Greek metaphysics]] that metallic and other elements could be transformed into one another.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 637"/&gt; However, what was largely accurate of the ancient Greek and medieval metaphysical ideas on mineralogy was the slow chemical change in composition of the Earth's crust.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 637"/&gt; There was also the [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Islamic alchemist]] and scientist [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (721-815 AD), who was the first to bring the [[experiment]]al method into alchemy. Aided by [[Greek mathematics]] and [[Islamic mathematics]], he discovered the syntheses for [[hydrochloric acid]], [[nitric acid]], [[distillation]] and [[crystallization]] (the latter two being essential for the understanding of modern mineralogy).

===Georgius Agricola, 'Father of Mineralogy'===

[[File:Georgius Agricola.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Agricola, author of De re metallica]]

In the early 16th century AD, the writings of the [[Germany|German]] scientist Georg Bauer, pen-name [[Georgius Agricola]] (1494-1555 AD), in his ''Bermannus, sive de re metallica dialogus'' (1530) is considered to be the official establishment of mineralogy in the modern sense of its study. He wrote the treatise while working as a town physician and making observations in [[Joachimsthal]], which was then a center for [[mining]] and [[metallurgy|metallurgic]] [[smelting]] industries. In 1544, he published his written work ''De ortu et causis subterraneorum'', which is considered to be the foundational work of modern physical [[geology]]. In it (much like Ibn Sina) he heavily criticized the theories laid out by the ancient Greeks such as Aristotle. His work on mineralogy and metallurgy continued with the publication of ''De veteribus et novis metallis'' in 1546, and culminated in his best known works, the ''[[De re metallica]]'' of 1556. It was an impressive work outlining applications of [[mining]], refining, and [[smelting]] metals, alongside discussions on geology of ore bodies, [[surveying]], mine construction, and [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]]. He praises [[Pliny the Elder]] for his pioneering work [[Naturalis Historia]] and makes extensive references to his discussion of minerals and mining methods. For the next two centuries this written work remained the authoritative text on mining in Europe.

Agricola had many various theories on mineralogy based on empirical observation, including understanding of the concept of [[ore]] channels that were formed by the circulation of ground waters ('succi') in [[fissure]]s subsequent to the deposition of the surrounding rocks.&lt;ref name = "needham volume 3 649"/&gt; As will be noted below, the medieval Chinese previously had conceptions of this as well.

For his works, Agricola is posthumously known as the "Father of Mineralogy".

After the foundational work written by Agricola, it is widely agreed by the scientific community that the ''Gemmarum et Lapidum Historia'' of [[Anselmus de Boodt]] (1550–1632) of [[Bruges]] is the first definitive work of modern mineralogy.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 646"/&gt; The German mining [[chemist]] [[J.F. Henckel]] wrote his ''Flora Saturnisans'' of 1760, which was the first treatise in Europe to deal with geobotanical minerals, although the Chinese had mentioned this in earlier treatises of 1421 and 1664.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 678"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 678.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Chinese writer [[Du Wan]] made clear references to weathering and erosion processes in his ''Yun Lin Shi Pu'' of 1133, long before Agricola's work of 1546.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 604"/&gt;

==China and the Far East==

In ancient China, the oldest literary listing of minerals dates back to at least the 4th century BC, with the ''Ji Ni Zi'' book listing twenty four of them.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 643"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 643.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese ideas of metaphysical mineralogy span back to at least the ancient Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD). From the 2nd century BC text of the ''Huai Nan Zi'', the Chinese used ideological [[Taoist]] terms to describe [[meteorology]], [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], different types of minerals, metallurgy, and alchemy.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 640"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 640.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the understanding of these concepts in Han times was Taoist in nature, the theories proposed were similar to the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] theory of mineralogical exhalations (noted above).&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 640"/&gt; By 122 BC, the Chinese had thus formulated the theory for metamorphosis of minerals, although it is noted by historians such as Dubs that the tradition of alchemical-mineralogical Chinese doctrine stems back to the School of Naturalists headed by the philosopher [[Zou Yan]] (305 BC–240 BC).&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 641"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 641.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the broad categories of rocks and stones (shi) and metals and alloys (jin), by Han times the Chinese had hundreds (if not thousands) of listed types of stones and minerals, along with theories for how they were formed.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 641"/&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 651"/&gt;

In the 5th century AD, Prince [[Qian Ping Wang]] of the [[Liu Song Dynasty]] wrote in the encyclopedia ''Tai-ping Yu Lan'' (circa 444 AD, from the lost book ''Dian Shu'', or ''Management of all Techniques''):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The most precious things in the world are stored in the innermost regions of all. For example, there is [[orpiment]]. After a thousand years it changes into [[realgar]]. After another thousand years the realgar becomes transformed into yellow gold.''&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 638"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 638.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ancient and medieval China, mineralogy became firmly tied to [[empirical]] observations in pharmaceutics and [[medicine]]. For example, the famous [[horologist]] and [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]] [[engineer]] [[Su Song]] (1020–1101 AD) of the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279 AD) wrote of mineralogy and [[pharmacology]] in his ''Ben Cao Tu Jing'' of 1070. In it he created a systematic approach to listing various different minerals and their use in medicinal concoctions, such as all the variously known forms of [[mica]] that could be used to cure various ills through [[digestion]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 648"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 648.&lt;/ref&gt; Su Song also wrote of the [[subconchoidal]] fracture of native [[cinnabar]], signs of ore beds, and provided description on crystal form.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 649"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 649.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the ore channels formed by circulation of ground water mentioned above with the German scientist Agricola, Su Song made similar statements concerning [[Basic copper carbonate|copper carbonate]], as did the earlier ''Ri Hua Ben Cao'' of 970 AD with copper [[sulfate]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 649"/&gt;

The [[Yuan Dynasty]] scientist [[Zhang Si-xiao]] (died 1332 AD) provided a groundbreaking treatise on the conception of ore beds from the circulation of ground waters and rock fissures, two centuries before Georgius Agricola would come to similar conclusions.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 650"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 650.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Suo-Nan Wen Ji'', he applies this theory in describing the deposition of minerals by [[evaporation]] of (or precipitation from) ground waters in ore channels.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 651"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 651.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to alchemical theory posed above, later Chinese writers such as the [[Ming Dynasty]] [[physician]] [[Li Shizhen]] (1518–1593 AD) wrote of mineralogy in similar terms of Aristotle's metaphysical theory, as the latter wrote in his [[pharmaceutical]] treatise ''Běncǎo Gāngmù'' (本草綱目, ''[[Compendium of Materia Medica]]'', 1596).&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 637"/&gt; Another figure from the Ming era, the famous [[geographer]] [[Xu Xiake]] (1587–1641) wrote of mineral beds and mica schists in his treatise.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 645"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 645.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while European literature on mineralogy became wide and varied, the writers of the Ming and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties wrote little of the subject (even compared to Chinese of the earlier Song era). The only other works from these two eras worth mentioning were the ''Shi Pin'' (Hierarchy of Stones) of [[Yu Jun]] in 1617, the ''Guai Shi Lu'' (Strange Rocks) of [[Song Luo]] in 1665, and the ''Guan Shi Lu'' (On Looking at Stones) in 1668.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 645"/&gt; However, one figure from the Song era that is worth mentioning above all is Shen Kuo.

===Theories of Shen Kuo===

[[File:Shen Kua.JPG|thumb|[[Shen Kuo]] (沈括) (1031-1095))]]
The medieval Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] statesman and scientist [[Shen Kuo]] (1031-1095 AD) wrote of his land formation theory involving concepts of mineralogy. In his ''Meng Xi Bi Tan'' (梦溪笔谈; ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', 1088), Shen formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation ([[geomorphology]]); based on his observation of [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[fossil]] shells in a geological stratum in the [[Taihang Mountains]] hundreds of miles from the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name="sivin III 23"&gt;Sivin, III, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; He inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of [[silt]], and described [[soil erosion]], [[sedimentation]] and uplift.&lt;ref name="sivin III 23 24"&gt;Sivin, III, 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt; In an earlier work of his (circa 1080), he wrote of a curious fossil of a sea-orientated creature found far inland.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 618"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 618.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also of interest to note that the contemporary author of the ''Xi Chi Cong Yu'' attributed the idea of particular places under the sea where serpents and crabs were petrified to one [[Wang Jinchen]]. With Shen Kuo's writing of the discovery of fossils, he formulated a hypothesis for the shifting of [[Climate change|geographical climate]]s throughout time.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 614"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 614.&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to hundreds of [[petrified]] [[bamboo]]s found underground in the dry climate of northern China, once an enormous landslide upon the bank of a river revealed them.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 614"/&gt; Shen theorized that in pre-historic times, the climate of Yanzhou must have been very rainy and humid like southern China, where bamboos are suitable to grow.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 614"/&gt;

In a similar way, the historian [[Joseph Needham]] likened Shen's account with the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] scientist [[Roderick Murchison]] (1792–1871), who was inspired to become a geologist after observing a providential landslide. In addition, Shen's description of sedimentary deposition predated that of [[James Hutton]], who wrote his groundbreaking work in 1802 (considered the foundation of modern geology).&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 604"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 604&lt;/ref&gt; The influential philosopher [[Zhu Xi]] (1130–1200) wrote of this curious natural phenomena of fossils as well, and was known to have read the works of Shen Kuo.&lt;ref name="chan 15"&gt;Chan, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, the first mentioning of fossils found in the West was made nearly two centuries later with [[Louis IX of France]] in 1253 AD, who discovered fossils of marine animals (as recorded in Joinville's records of 1309 AD).&lt;ref name="chan 14"&gt;Chan, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==America==
Perhaps the most influential mineralogy text in the 19th and 20th centuries was the ''Manual of Mineralogy'' by [[James Dwight Dana]], Yale professor, first published in 1848. The fourth edition was entitled ''Manual of Mineralogy and Lithology'' (ed. 4, 1887).  It became a standard college text, and has been continuously revised and updated by a succession of editors including W. E. Ford (13th-14th eds., 1912–1929), Cornelius S. Hurlbut (15th-21st eds., 1941–1999), and beginning with the 22nd by Cornelis Klein. The 23rd edition is now in print under the title ''Manual of Mineral Science (Manual of Mineralogy)'' (2007), revised by Cornelis Klein and Barbara Dutrow.

Equally influential was Dana's ''System of Mineralogy'', first published in 1837, which has consistently been updated and revised. The 6th edition (1892)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Edward Salisbury Dana]] |title=The system of mineralogy of James Dwight Dana |edition=2 |url=https://archive.org/details/mineralogyjames00danaric |accessdate=2009-07-06 |year=1911 |location=New York |publisher=J. Wiley &amp; Sons }}&lt;/ref&gt; being edited by his son [[Edward Salisbury Dana]]. A 7th edition was published in 1944, and the 8th edition was published in 1997 under the title ''Dana's New Mineralogy: The System of Mineralogy of James Dwight Dana and Edward Salisbury Dana'', edited by R. V. Gaines ''et al.''

== Impact Database ==
{{Distinguish|Earth Impact Database}}
IFSG member David Rajmon maintains for the organization a list which was originally called the '''Suspected Earth Impact Sites''' (SEIS) list from 2004 to 2009.  It was then renamed to simply the '''Impact Database'''.  The list classifies impact sites as confirmed, most probable, probable, possible, improbable, rejected and proposed (unevaluated). The list retains rejected entries because they tend to be submitted repeatedly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
* The submitter should download the Impact Database or KML (Google Earth) version of it to verify that the site has not already been included, and possibly rejected.
* If the submitter is not familiar with the science behind recognition of impact craters, they must read [[Traces of Catastrophe]].
* They should look at maps to consider other alternatives to impact craters, whether man-made (such as mining pits and ponds) or natural (such as sinkholes and volcanic vents).
* The page lists some suggestions how to avoid fixating on the possibility of an impact and consider more open investigation of what the feature is.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2783">The '''isoazimuth''' is the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of the points on the Earth's surface whose initial [[Great-circle distance|orthodromic course]] with respect to a fixed point is constant.&lt;ref&gt;Flexner, W. W.. 1943. “Azimuth Line of Position”. The American Mathematical Monthly 50 (8). Mathematical Association of America: 475–84. doi:10.2307/2304185. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2304185?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Accessed 2016-01-24].&lt;/ref&gt;

That is, if the initial [[Great-circle distance|orthodromic course]] Z from the starting point ''S'' to the fixed point ''X'' is 80  [[Degree (angle)|degrees]], the associated isoazimuth is formed by all points whose initial [[Great-circle distance|orthodromic course]] with respect to point ''X'' is 80° (with respect to true north). The isoazimuth is written using the notation ''isoz(X, Z)''.

The isoazimuth is of use when [[navigation|navigating]] with respect to an object of known location, such as a radio beacon. A straight line called the ''azimuth line of position'' is drawn on a map, and on most common map projections this is a close enough approximation to the isoazimuth. On the [[Littrow projection]], the correspondence is exact. This line is then crossed with an astronomical observation called a [[Sumner line]], and the result gives an estimate of the navigator's position.

== Isoazimutal on the spherical Earth ==
Let '''X''' be a fixed point on the Earth of coordinates latitude: '''B2''', and longitude: '''L2'''. In a terrestrial spherical model, the equation of isoazimuth line of initial course '''C''' passing through point S('''B''', '''L''') is:
'''&lt;math&gt;tan(B2)*cos(B) = sin(B) * cos(L2-L)+sin(L2-L)/tan(C)\;&lt;/math&gt;'''

== Isoazimutal of a star ==
In this case the '''X''' point is the illuminating pole of the observed star, and the angle '''Z''' is its [[azimuth]]. The equation of the ''isoazimuthal'' &lt;ref&gt;Le segment capable sphérique. Navigation Nº.116 Vol.XXIX, Institut français de navigation, octubre/1981.&lt;/ref&gt;curve for a star with coordinates ('''Dec, Gha'''), -''Declination'' and ''Greenwich Hour Angle''-, observed under an azimuth '''Z''' is given by:
 
: '''&lt;math&gt;\cot(Z)/\cos(B) = \tan(Dec)/\sin(lha)-\tan(B)/\tan(lha)\;&lt;/math&gt;'''
where '''lha''' is the  local hour angle, and all points with '''latitude''' '''B''' and '''longitude''' '''L''', they define the curve.

The '''Kola Superdeep Borehole''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Кольская сверхглубокая скважина|tr=Kolskaya sverkhglubokaya skvazhina}}) is the result of a [[scientific drilling]] project of the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Pechengsky District]], on the [[Kola Peninsula]]. The project attempted to drill as deep as possible into the [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]]. Drilling began on 24 May 1970 using the ''Uralmash-4E'', and later the ''Uralmash-15000'' series drilling rig. [[Borehole]]s were drilled by branching from a central hole. The deepest, '''SG-3''', reached {{convert|12,262|m}} in 1989 and is the [[Extreme points of Earth#Lowest artificial points|deepest artificial point]] on Earth, {{asof|2018|11|lc=y}}. The borehole is {{convert|9|in|cm|order=flip}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/ask-smithsonian-whats-deepest-hole-ever-dug-180954349 "Ask Smithsonian: What's the Deepest Hole Ever Dug?"], ''smithsonian.com'', 19 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of [[true vertical depth]], it is the deepest borehole in the world. For two decades it was also the world's longest borehole in terms of [[measured depth]] along the well bore, until it was [[Directional drilling|surpassed]] in 2008 by the {{convert|12289|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} [[Al Shaheen Oil Field|Al Shaheen oil well]] in Qatar, and in 2011 by the {{convert|12345|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} [[Sakhalin-I]] Odoptu OP-11 Well (offshore from the Russian island of [[Sakhalin]]).&lt;ref name=record/&gt;

The hole reached {{convert|12262|m|abbr=on}} in 1989. In that year, the hole depth was expected to reach {{convert|13500|m|abbr=on}} by the end of 1990 and {{convert|15000|m|abbr=on}} by 1993.&lt;ref&gt;''Kola Superdeep is in the Guinness Book of World Records'', ''Zemlya i Vselennaya'', 1989, no. 3, p.9 {{Ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="factbook"&gt;{{cite web|first=Adam|last=Cassino|title= Depth of the Deepest Drilling|work=The Physics Factbook|date=2003|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/AdamCassino.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of higher-than-expected temperatures at this depth and location, {{convert|180|°C|°F|0}} instead of the expected {{convert|100|°C|°F|0}}, drilling deeper was deemed unfeasible and the drilling was stopped in 1992.&lt;ref name="NiZ" /&gt;

==Research==
The Kola borehole penetrated about a third of the way through the [[Baltic Shield]] [[continental crust]], estimated to be around {{convert|35|km|mi|0}} deep, reaching [[Archean|Archaean]] rocks at the bottom.&lt;ref name="LBT"&gt;{{cite book| last = Ramberg| first = I.B. | author2 = Bryhni I. | author3 = Nøttvedt A. | lastauthoramp=yes| title = The making of a land: geology of Norway| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rMVNE0F2SckC&amp;pg=PA76| accessdate = 27 January 2010| date = 2008| publisher = [[Geological Society]]| isbn = 978-82-92394-42-7| page = 624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has been a site of extensive [[Geophysics|geophysical]] studies. The stated areas of study were the deep structure of the Baltic Shield, [[seismic]] discontinuities and the thermal regime in the Earth's crust, the physical and chemical composition of the deep crust and the transition from upper to lower crust, [[lithosphere|lithospheric]] geophysics, and to create and develop technologies for deep geophysical study.

To scientists, one of the more fascinating findings to emerge from this well is that no transition from [[granite]] to [[basalt]] was found at the depth of about {{Convert|7|km|abbr=on}}, where the velocity of seismic waves has a discontinuity. Instead the change in the seismic wave velocity is caused by a [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] transition in the granite rock. In addition, the rock at that depth had been thoroughly fractured and was saturated with water, which was surprising. This water, unlike surface water, must have come from deep-crust minerals and had been unable to reach the surface because of a layer of [[Permeability (fluid)|impermeable]] rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Alan Bellows | title=The Deepest Hole | url=http://www.damninteresting.com/the-deepest-hole/ | work=Damn Interesting | date=5 March 2007 | accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microscopic plankton fossils were found 6 kilometers (4 mi) below the surface.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another unexpected discovery was a large quantity of [[hydrogen]] gas.  The [[Drilling fluid|mud]] that flowed out of the hole was described as "boiling" with hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author=G.J.

== Records ==
The Kola Superdeep Borehole was the longest and deepest borehole in the world for nearly 20 years. In May 2008, a new record for borehole length was established by the [[extended reach drilling|extended-reach drilling (ERD)]] well BD-04A, which was drilled by [[Transocean]] for [[Maersk Oil]] in the [[Al Shaheen Oil Field]] in Qatar. It was drilled to {{convert|12289|m|abbr=on}}, with a record horizontal reach of {{convert|10902|m|abbr=on}} in only 36 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Transocean GSF Rig 127 Drills Deepest Extended-Reach Well | url=http://www.deepwater.com/fw/main/Transocean-GSF-Rig-127-Drills-Deepest-Extended-Reach-Well-283C4.html | publisher=Transocean Ltd. | date=21 May 2008 | accessdate=15 November 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112192456/http://www.deepwater.com/fw/main/Transocean-GSF-Rig-127-Drills-Deepest-Extended-Reach-Well-283C4.html | archivedate=12 November 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Maersk Oil finished Drilling (BD-04A) well at Al-Shaheen field, Qatar | work=Gulf Oil &amp; Gas Marketplace | url=http://www.gulfoilandgas.com/webpro1/main/mainnews.asp?id=6050 | date=23 May 2008 | accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 January 2011, Exxon Neftegas Ltd., operator of the [[Sakhalin-I]] project, drilled the world's longest extended-reach well offshore on the Russian island of [[Sakhalin]]. It has surpassed the length of both the Al Shaheen well and the Kola borehole. The Odoptu OP-11 well reached a measured total length of {{convert|12345|m|abbr=on}} and a horizontal displacement of {{convert|11475|m|abbr=on}}.

'''Lacus Spei''' ([[Latin]] for "Lake of Hope") is a small [[lunar mare]] that is located in the northeastern part of the [[Moon]]'s near side. To the north is the crater [[Mercurius (crater)|Mercurius]] and to the west-southwest lies [[Schumacher (crater)|Schumacher]].

The selenographic [[coordinate]]s of this feature are 43.0° N, 65.0° E, and it lies within a diameter of 77&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;[https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/3218 Lacus Spei], Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature, International Astronomical Union (IAU) Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN)&lt;/ref&gt; The main part of the lake occupies a region averaging about 50&amp;nbsp;km in diameter, with an extension leading to the northeast. The surface has the same low [[albedo]] as the larger mare features on the Moon, becoming lighter in hue near the edges. The only feature on this bay is the circular, cup-shaped satellite crater Zeno&amp;nbsp;P. The crater [[Zeno (crater)|Zeno]] lies to the east-northeast, closer to the lunar limb.

The '''true grasses''' ('''[[Poaceae]]''') are one of the largest plant families, with around 12,000 species and roughly 800 genera.&lt;ref name="SorengPeterson2015"/&gt; They contain, among others, the [[cereal]] crop species and other plants of economic importance, such as the [[bamboos]], and several important [[weed]]s.

[[Anomochlooideae]], [[Pharoideae]] and [[Puelioideae]] are early diverging lineages containing only a few species. Most of the diversity falls into the two big [[BOP clade|BOP]] and [[PACMAD clade|PACMAD]] clades, which each contain roughly half of the family's species. C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; lineages have only evolved in the PACMAD clade, whereas many lineages in the BOP clade have evolved adaptations to cold climate.

While the higher-level classification of the grasses is now relatively well understood, taxonomic efforts continue at the species and genera level, and with continuing phylogenetic research, a number of names is likely to change.&lt;ref name=VorontsovaSimons2012&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vorontsova|first1=Maria S. |last2=Simon |first2=Bryan K. |title=Updating classifications to reflect monophyly: 10 to 20 percent of species names change in Poaceae |journal=Taxon |volume=61 |issue=4 |year=2012 |pages=735–746|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maria_Vorontsova/publication/260285689_Updating_classifications_to_reflect_monophyly_10_to_20_percent_of_species_names_change_in_Poaceae/links/02e7e5307e63c1cc8e000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list of genera below is therefore likely to evolve with further study.

[[File:Granite Peak Montana 2.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Granite Peak (Montana)|Granite Peak]] is the highest summit of the [[Beartooth Range]] and the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Montana|State of Montana]].]]

This article comprises three sortable tables of [[Summit|major mountain peaks]]&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Montana|State of Montana]].

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in this article include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Highest major summits|first table]] below ranks the 50 highest major summits of Montana by elevation.
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;  The [[#Most prominent summits|second table]] below ranks the 50 most prominent summits of Montana.
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Most isolated major summits|third table]] below ranks the 50 most isolated major summits of Montana.
__TOC__{{clear}}

==Highest major summits==
{{GeoGroup|section=Highest major summits}}
Of the highest major summits of Montana, three peaks exceed {{convert|3500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation and 44 peaks exceed {{convert|3000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation.

A '''mesoporous material''' is a material containing [[wiktionary:pore|pore]]s with diameters between 2 and 50&amp;nbsp;nm, according to [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1351/pac199466081739| title = Recommendations for the characterization of porous solids (Technical Report)| journal = Pure and Applied Chemistry| volume = 66| issue = 8| year = 1994| last1 = Rouquerol | first1 = J.| last2 = Avnir | first2 = D.| last3 = Fairbridge | first3 = C.

W.| last9 = Unger | first9 = K. K.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, IUPAC defines [[microporous material]] as a material having pores smaller than 2 nm in diameter and [[macroporous material]] as a material having pores larger than 50 nm in diameter.

Typical mesoporous materials include some kinds of [[Mesoporous silica|silica]] and [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]] that have similarly-sized mesopores. Mesoporous oxides of [[niobium]], [[tantalum]], [[titanium]], [[zirconium]], [[cerium]] and [[tin]] have also been reported. However, the flagship of mesoporous materials is mesoporous carbon, which has direct applications in energy storage devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Eftekhari|first1 = Ali|last2 = Zhaoyang |first2 = Fan|title = Ordered mesoporous carbon and its applications for electrochemical energy storage and conversion|journal = Materials Chemistry Frontiers|date = 2017|volume = 1|pages = 1001–1027|doi = 10.1039/C6QM00298F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mesoporous carbon has porosity within the mesopore range and this significantly increases the specific surface area.  An other very common mesoporous material is [[Activated carbon|Activated Carbon]] which is typically composed of a carbon framework with both mesoporosity and microporosity depending on the conditions under which it was synthesized.

According to IUPAC, a mesoporous material can be disordered or ordered in a mesostructure. In crystalline inorganic materials, mesoporous structure noticeably limits the number of lattice units, and this significantly changes the solid-state chemistry. For example, the battery performance of mesoporous electroactive materials is significantly different from that of their bulk structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Eftekhari|first1 = Ali|title = Ordered Mesoporous Materials for Lithium-Ion Batteries|journal = Microporous and Mesoporous Materials|date = 2017|volume = 243|pages = 355–369|doi = 10.1016/j.micromeso.2017.02.055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A procedure for producing mesoporous materials (silica) was patented around 1970,&lt;ref&gt;Chiola, V.; Ritsko, J. E. and Vanderpool, C. D.

Since then, research in this field has steadily grown. Notable examples of prospective industrial applications are [[catalysis]], sorption, gas sensing, ion exchange, [[optics]], and [[photovoltaics]].

It should be taken into account that this mesoporosity refers to the classification of nanoscale porosity, and mesopores may be defined differently in other contexts; for example, mesopores are defined as cavities with sizes in the range 30&amp;nbsp;μm–75&amp;nbsp;μm in the context of porous aggregations such as soil.&lt;ref name=pore&gt;{{cite book |title= Glossary of Soil Science Terms 2008 |last= Soil Science Glossary Terms Committee |date= 2008 |publisher= Soil Science Society of America |location= Madison, WI |isbn= 978-0-89118-851-3 |url= https://www.soils.org/publications/soils-glossary#}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
'''Milarepa's Cave''' or '''Namkading Cave''' is a cave where the great Tibetan Buddhist philosopher, and [[Vajrayana]] [[Mahasiddha]], [[Milarepa]] (c. 1052—c. 1135 [[Common Era|CE]]), spent many years of his life in the eleventh century, 11&amp;nbsp;km north of the town of [[Nyalam Town|Nyalam]], below the roadside and above the Matsang river in [[Nyalam County]], [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorje (1999), p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a cave associated with Milarepa in Nepal on the [[Annapurna Circuit]] at approximately 4000m just outside [[Manang]].  It is credited to have been the residence of the famous Saint Milarepa during his stay in modern-day northern Nepal. This site also includes a holy spring, [[gompa]], and bow from the local archer who met and tried to kill Milarepa.  In the classical songs of Milarepa, [http://www.kreisels.com/milarepa/milarepa-songs-english.htm#hunter he sings of a deer, a dog and a hunter], the chain of causation and compassion.  In local tradition this is the site of this famous tale.  [http://www.nepal-dia.de/int__England/EV_Annapurna/EB_milarepas_Gompa/eb_milarepas_gompa.html The cave is located] beyond the Gompa, the locals pray from the edge of a glacial moraine in directly line of sight of the cave as its approach directly is on steep scree slope.

==Phelgyeling Monastery==
A path leads down from the roadside through the village and down a hillside where there is a small monastery ([[gompa]]) named Nyanang '''Pelgye Ling Monastery''',  or '''Phelgyeling''' which is built around the cave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tibetanexpeditions.com/ Tibet: Highlights in Brief]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl-Heinz Everding, "Tibet: lamaistische Klosterkulturen, nomadische Lebensformen und bäuerlicher Alltag ...", p. 260. {{ISBN|3-7701-4803-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly Hall of the monastery has the statue of Buddha Shakyamuni in center which is 7feet in height.

The monastery used to be a [[Kagyupa]]  but, later the monastery was converted to Gelugpa by H.H.5th Dalai Lama, Later Phelgyeling Monastery was affiliated with the [[Gelugpa]] [[Sera Monastery]] in [[Lhasa]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorje (1999), p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of the cave==
Milarepa's cave, which overlooks the entrance to the hidden valley of Lapchi Gang, is entered from the gompa's [[Vestibule (Architecture)|vestibule]]. Pilgrim's offerings of decorated stones along the path and sweet-smelling herbs and wild flowers growing all around make this a place of great peace and beauty. The cave itself is kept as a shrine by two monks, guarding a statue of Milarepa enclosed in a glass case. In the cave is an impression in the rock attributed to Milarepa's sitting meditation posture and a hand print said to have been created when Milarepa helped [[Rechungpa]] (1083/4-1161 CE), his student, use a boulder to prop up the ceiling. There are images of Milarepa, [[Tsongkhapa]], and [[Palden Lhamo|Shri Devi]], a protectress whose mule is said to have left a footprint in the stone when she visited Milarepa in a vision.&lt;ref&gt;Dorje (1999), p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

Restoration work within the cave and the monastery was undertaken by artists and craftsmen from [[Nepal]]&lt;ref&gt;Dowman, Keith. 1988. ''The Power-places of Central Tibet: The Pilgrim's Guide''. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London &amp; New York. {{ISBN|0-7102-1370-0}}, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; and was financed in the 1970s by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]], which has been in military occupation of Tibet since 1950.

==In art==
The cave and the Pelgye Ling temple have been the subject of [[Richard Gere]]'s artistic photo work,

Some typical whisker materials are [[graphite]], [[aluminum oxide|alumina]], [[iron]], [[silicon carbide]] and [[silicon]]. Single-crystal whiskers of these (and some other) materials are known for having very high [[tensile strength]] (on the order of 10&amp;ndash;20 [[gigapascal|GPa]]). Whiskers are used in some [[composite material|composites]], but large-scale fabrication of defect-free whiskers is very difficult.

Prior to the discovery of [[carbon nanotube]]s, single-crystal whiskers had the highest [[tensile strength]] of any materials known, and were featured regularly in [[science fiction]] as materials for fabrication of [[space elevator]]s, [[arcology|arcologies]], and other large structures. Despite showing great promise for a range of applications, their usage has been hindered by concerns over their effects on health when inhaled.

It is also called "cellular vampirism" as the predatory [[cell (biology)|cell]] pierces the [[cell wall]] and/or [[cell membrane]] of the prey cell with a feeding tube, the '''conoid''', sucks out the cellular content and digests it.

Myzocytosis is found in [[Myzozoa]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-5d35e684-a832-3187-bc57-5f3d2ba06a04&lt;/ref&gt; and also in some species of [[Ciliophora]] (both comprise the [[alveolate]]s). A classic example of myzocytosis is the feeding method of the infamous predatory ciliate, ''[[Didinium]]'', where it is often depicted devouring a hapless ''[[Paramecium]]''.  The [[suctoria]]n [[ciliate]]s were originally thought to have fed exclusively through myzocytosis, sucking out the cytoplasm of prey via superficially [[drinking straw]]-like pseudopodia.  It is now understood that suctorians do not feed through myzocytosis, but actually, instead, manipulate and envenomate captured prey with their tentacle-like pseudopodia.&lt;ref name=Rudzinska1973&gt;{{Cite journal| author1 = Rudzinska | first1 = M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8153">The '''Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization''' (NAFO) is an intergovernmental organization with a mandate to provide scientific advice and management of [[fisheries]] in the northwestern part of the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  NAFO is headquartered in [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia]], Canada.

==Mandate==

NAFO's overall objective is to contribute through consultation and cooperation to the optimum utilization, rational management and conservation of the fishery resources of the Convention Area.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20070622132629/http://www.nafo.int/about/frames/convention.html NAFO Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries] applies to most fishery resources of the Northwest Atlantic except salmon, tunas/marlins, whales, and sedentary species (e.g. shellfish).

In 2007 NAFO adopted an Amended Convention. The Convention must be ratified by 3/4 of the Members to come into effect. The original objective was modernized to include an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. It now expands beyond a sustainable use of the commercial northwest Atlantic fishery resources by committing to also protect the associated marine ecosystems from adverse fisheries effects.

==History==
In 1950, the fishing nations who operated fleets on the [[continental shelf]] of [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] began to recognize that fishing resources were finite and sought to establish an international multinational organization to provide for cooperation in preserving fish stocks.  This organization, the '''International Commission for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries''', or ICNAF, was organized that year and mandated to use modern scientific methods in providing advice to member nations.

The ICNAF was supported by the "International Convention for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries", however between 1973-1982 the [[United Nations]] and its member states negotiated the "Third Convention of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]]" - one component of which, the concept of nations being allowed to declare an [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ), was ratified and implemented in 1977.  This extension of national fisheries jurisdiction over large areas of the continental shelf in this region by [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Greenland]] and [[St. Pierre and Miquelon]] required that the ICNAF be replaced with a new convention.

In 1979 ICNAF was replaced by the '''Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization''' (NAFO) which was established under the "Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries".  NAFO continues ICNAF's legacy under a mandate of providing scientific advice to member states with the premise of ensuring the conservation and management of fish stocks in the region. The NAFO mandate includes most fishery resources in the Northwest Atlantic, except salmon, tunas/marlins, whales, and sedentary species (e.g. shellfish).

In 2014, NAFO regulates eleven fish species (19 stocks) and a fishing ban (moratorium) is in place for 8 fish stocks belonging to five species (cod, American plaice, witch flounder, capelin and shrimp; for many of these stocks the fishing moratorium started more than a decade ago. Recently however, two stocks (redfish and cod) were reopened to fishing after a decade long moratoria. NAFO co-manages the pelagic redfish in Subarea 2 and Div. 1F-3K (off Greenland) with its sister organization, NEAFC.

NAFO is implementing the Precautionary Approach that takes into account scientific uncertainties and thus allows for improved protection of the resources. Recently NAFO Adopted the MSE (Management Strategy Evaluation) for the Greenland halibut stock. This approach considers a survey based harvest control rule (HCR) in setting the TAC. NAFO was the first regional fisheries management organization to regulate the fishery of a species (thorny skate) belonging to skates or sharks (elasmobranchs).

Management measures of NAFO (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20070607011431/http://www.nafo.int/fisheries/CEM/cem.html '''NAFO Conservation and Enforcement Measures'''] are updated every year) include Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and [[Individual fishing quota|quota]]s for regulated stocks, as well as restrictions for by-catch, minimum fish size, area, and time. In addition, NAFO imposes a number of control measures on the international fishery in the NAFO Regulatory Area, for example authorization to fish, vessel and gear requirements, controlled chartering arrangements, and product labelling requirements.

NAFO also requires that fishing vessels record and communicate their catches and fishing efforts. Reliability of these records is enhanced by the Observer Program and the NAFO Vessel Monitoring System (VMS). The Observer Program requires each fishing vessel in the NAFO area to carry an independent observer on board. Inder the VMS each vessel fishing in the NAFO area is equipped with a satellite monitoring device that automatically and continuously (every two hours) reports the position.

NAFO has also adopted Port State Control Measures that apply to landings or transshipments in ports of Contracting Parties by fishing vessels flying the flag of another Contracting Party. The provisions apply to landing or transshipment of fish caught in the Regulatory Area, or fish products originating from such fish, that have not been previously landed or offloaded at a port.

NAFO’s joint (international) inspection and surveillance scheme includes frequent and indiscriminate at-sea inspections by authorized inspectors from NAFO member states. In addition to at-sea inspections, NAFO requires obligatory port inspections. It is the duty of flag states to perform follow-up investigations and to prosecute. NAFO publishes an annual Compliance Report.

NAFO has identified 18 areas, within its Convention area, as being vulnerable to bottom contact gears and subsequently closed the areas to bottom fishing.  These closures will be reviewed in 2014. NAFO has also delineated existing bottom fishing areas (footprint), in response to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA Res. 61/105, paragraph 83) request for Regional Fisheries Management Organizations to regulate bottom fisheries that cause a significant adverse impact on vulnerable marine ecosystems.

NAFO has been criticized for not being able to efficiently stop overfishing when many fish stocks in the Northwest Atlantic (both coastal and high-seas stocks) collapsed. Anger among fishermen in Eastern Canada, particularly [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] that was directed against international fishing vessels led to [[Canada]] exercising [[extra-territorial]] jurisdiction on a [[Spain|Spanish]]-flagged fishing trawler named ''Estai'' in 1995 during the so-called [[Turbot War]].

{{nuclear physics}}
In [[nuclear physics]], '''nuclear fusion''' is a [[nuclear reaction|reaction]] in which two or more [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] are combined to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles ([[neutrons]] or [[protons]]). The difference in mass between the reactants and products is manifested as either the release or absorption of [[energy]]. This difference in mass arises due to the difference in atomic "[[binding energy]]" between the atomic nuclei before and after the reaction. Fusion is the process that powers active or "[[main sequence]]" [[star]]s, or other [[Absolute magnitude|high magnitude]] stars.

A fusion process that produces a nucleus lighter than [[iron-56]] or [[nickel-62]] will generally yield a net energy release. These elements have the smallest mass per nucleon and the largest [[binding energy]] per [[nucleon]], respectively. Fusion of light elements toward these releases energy (an [[exothermic]] process), while a fusion producing nuclei heavier than these elements will result in energy retained by the resulting nucleons, and the resulting reaction is [[endothermic]]. The opposite is true for the reverse process, [[nuclear fission]]. This means that the lighter elements, such as hydrogen and [[helium fusion|helium]], are in general more fusible; while the heavier elements, such as [[Uranium 235|uranium]], [[thorium]] and [[Plutonium 239|plutonium]], are more fissionable. The extreme [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] event of a [[supernova]] can produce enough energy to fuse nuclei into elements heavier than iron.

In 1920, [[Arthur Eddington]] suggested hydrogen-helium fusion could be the primary source of stellar energy. [[Quantum tunneling]] was discovered by [[Friedrich Hund]] in 1929, and shortly afterwards [[Robert d'Escourt Atkinson|Robert Atkinson]] and [[Fritz Houtermans]] used the measured masses of light elements to show that large amounts of energy could be released by fusing small nuclei. Building on the early experiments in [[nuclear transmutation]] by [[Ernest Rutherford]], laboratory fusion of [[Isotopes of hydrogen|hydrogen isotopes]] was accomplished by [[Mark Oliphant]] in 1932. In the remainder of that decade, the theory of the main cycle of nuclear fusion in stars were worked out by [[Hans Bethe]].  Research into fusion for military purposes began in the early 1940s as part of the [[Manhattan Project]].  Fusion was accomplished in 1951 with the [[Greenhouse Item]] nuclear test.  Nuclear fusion on a large scale in an explosion was first carried out on November 1, 1952, in the [[Ivy Mike]] [[hydrogen bomb]] test.

Research into developing controlled [[thermonuclear fusion]] for civil purposes began in earnest in the 1940s, and it continues to this day.

The release of energy with the fusion of light elements is due to the interplay of two opposing forces: the [[nuclear force]], which combines together protons and neutrons, and the [[Coulomb force]], which causes protons to repel each other. Protons are positively charged and repel each other by the Coulomb force, but they can nonetheless stick together, demonstrating the existence of another, short-range, force referred to as nuclear attraction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ck12.org/flexbook/chapter/1903 Physics Flexbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228011150/http://www.ck12.org/flexbook/chapter/1903 |date=28 December 2011 }}. Ck12.org. Retrieved on 2012-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Light nuclei (or nuclei smaller than iron and nickel) are sufficiently small and proton-poor allowing the nuclear force to overcome repulsion. This is because the nucleus is sufficiently small that all nucleons feel the short-range attractive force at least as strongly as they feel the infinite-range Coulomb repulsion. Building up nuclei from lighter nuclei by fusion releases the extra energy from the net attraction of particles. [[iron peak|For larger nuclei]], however, no energy is released, since the nuclear force is short-range and cannot continue to act across  longer atomic length scales. Thus, energy is not released with the fusion of such nuclei; instead, energy is required as input for such processes.

Fusion powers [[star]]s and produces virtually all elements in a process called [[nucleosynthesis]]. The Sun is a main-sequence star, and, as such, generates its energy by nuclear fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium. In its core, the Sun fuses 620 million metric tons of hydrogen and makes 606 million metric tons of helium each second.&lt;!-- Meant generally; please do not insert info about [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], [[supernova nucleosynthesis]] and other types of specific nucleosynthesis here. --&gt; The fusion of lighter elements in stars releases energy and the mass that always accompanies it. For example, in the fusion of two hydrogen nuclei to form helium, 0.7% of the mass is carried away in the form of kinetic energy of an [[alpha particle]] or other forms of energy, such as electromagnetic radiation.&lt;ref name="bulletin1950"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bethe |first=Hans A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mg4AAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA99 |title=The Hydrogen Bomb |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |date=April 1950 |volume=6 |issue=4 |page=99–104, 125–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It takes considerable energy to force nuclei to fuse, even those of the lightest element, [[hydrogen]]. When accelerated to high enough speeds, nuclei can overcome this electrostatic repulsion and brought close enough such that the attractive [[nuclear force]] is greater than the repulsive Coulomb force. The [[strong force]] grows rapidly once the nuclei are close enough, and the fusing nucleons can essentially "fall" into each other and the result is fusion and net energy produced. The fusion of lighter nuclei, which creates a heavier nucleus and often a [[free neutron]] or proton, generally releases more energy than it takes to force the nuclei together; this is an [[exothermic reaction|exothermic process]] that can produce self-sustaining reactions.

Energy{{anchor|energy}} released in most [[nuclear reaction]]s is much larger than in [[chemical reaction]]s, because the [[binding energy]] that holds a nucleus together is greater than the energy that holds [[electron]]s to a nucleus. For example, the [[ionization energy]] gained by adding an electron to a hydrogen nucleus is {{val|13.6|ul=eV}}—less than one-millionth of the {{val|17.6|ul=MeV}} released in the [[deuterium]]–[[tritium]] (D–T) reaction shown in the adjacent diagram. The complete conversion of one [[gram]] of matter would release 9×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; joules of energy. Fusion reactions have an [[energy density]] many times greater than [[nuclear fission]]; the reactions produce far greater energy per unit of mass even though ''individual'' fission reactions are generally much more energetic than ''individual'' fusion ones, which are themselves millions of times more energetic than chemical reactions. Only [[Direct energy conversion|direct conversion]] of [[Mass-energy equivalence|mass into energy]], such as that caused by the [[annihilation|annihilatory]] collision of [[matter]] and [[antimatter]], is more energetic per unit of mass than nuclear fusion.

Research into using [[fusion power|fusion]] for the production of electricity has been pursued for over 60 years. Successful accomplishment of controlled fusion has been stymied by scientific and technological difficulties; nonetheless, important progress has been made. At present, controlled fusion reactions have been unable to produce break-even (self-sustaining) controlled fusion.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most advanced approaches for it are magnetic confinement (toroid designs) and inertial confinement (laser designs).

Workable designs for a toroidal reactor that theoretically will deliver ten times more fusion energy than the amount needed to heat plasma to the required temperatures are in development (see [[ITER]]). The ITER facility is expected to finish its construction phase in 2019. It will start commissioning the reactor that same year and initiate plasma experiments in 2020, but is not expected to begin full deuterium-tritium fusion until 2027.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iter.org/proj/iterandbeyond |title=ITER – the way to new energy |year=2014 |website=ITER |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922162049/http://www.iter.org/proj/iterandbeyond |archivedate=22 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear fusion in stars==
[[Image:FusionintheSun.svg|thumb|250px|right|The [[proton-proton chain reaction]], branch&amp;nbsp;I, dominates in stars the size of the Sun or smaller.]]

[[Image:CNO Cycle.svg|thumb|250px|right|The [[CNO cycle]] dominates in stars heavier than the Sun.]]

An important fusion process is the [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] that powers [[star]]s and the Sun. In the 20th century, it was recognized that the energy released from nuclear fusion reactions accounted for the longevity of stellar heat and light. The fusion of nuclei in a star, starting from its initial hydrogen and helium abundance, provides that energy and synthesizes new nuclei as a byproduct of the fusion process.  Different reaction chains are involved, depending on the mass of the star (and therefore the pressure and temperature in its core).

Around 1920, [[Arthur Eddington]] anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in [[star]]s, in his paper ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars''.&lt;ref name=eddington&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Internal Constitution of the Stars |first=A. S. |last=Eddington |journal=The Scientific Monthly |volume=11 |issue=4  |date=October 1920 |page=297-303 |jstor=6491}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eddington2&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1916MNRAS..77...16E|title=On the radiative equilibrium of the stars|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=77|pages=16–35|author1=Eddington|first1=A. S.|year=1916|doi=10.1093/mnras/77.1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to Einstein's equation ''E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even that stars are largely composed of [[hydrogen]] (see [[metallicity]]), had not yet been discovered. Eddington's paper, based on knowledge at the time, reasoned that:

:# The leading theory of stellar energy, the [[contraction hypothesis]], should cause stars' rotation to visibly speed up due to [[conservation of angular momentum]]. But observations of [[Cepheid]] variable stars showed this was not happening.
:# The only other known plausible source of energy was conversion of matter to energy; Einstein had shown some years earlier that a small amount of matter was equivalent to a large amount of energy. 
:# [[Francis William Aston|Francis Aston]] had also recently shown that the mass of a [[helium]] atom was about 0.8% less than the mass of the four hydrogen atoms which would, combined, form a helium atom, suggesting that if such a combination could happen, it would release considerable energy as a byproduct.
:# If a star contained just 5% of fusible hydrogen, it would suffice to explain how stars got their energy. (We now know that most 'ordinary' stars contain far more than 5% hydrogen)
:# Further elements might also be fused, and other scientists had speculated that stars were the "crucible" in which light elements combined to create heavy elements, but without more accurate measurements of their [[atomic mass]]es nothing more could be said at the time.

All of these speculations were proven correct in the following decades.

The primary source of solar energy, and similar size stars, is the fusion of hydrogen to form helium (the [[proton-proton chain]] reaction), which occurs at a solar-core temperature of 14 million kelvin. The net result is the fusion of four [[proton]]s into one [[alpha particle]], with the release of two [[positron]]s and two [[neutrino]]s (which changes two of the protons into neutrons), and energy. In heavier stars, the [[CNO cycle]] and other processes are more important. As a star uses up a substantial fraction of its hydrogen, it begins to synthesize heavier elements. The heaviest elements are synthesized by fusion that occurs as a more massive star undergoes a violent [[supernova]] at the end of its life, a process known as [[supernova nucleosynthesis]].

==Requirements==

A substantial energy barrier of electrostatic forces must be overcome before fusion can occur. At large distances, two naked nuclei repel one another because of the repulsive [[electrostatic force]] between their [[electric charge|positively charged]] protons. If two nuclei can be brought close enough together, however, the electrostatic repulsion can be overcome by the quantum effect in which nuclei can [[quantum tunnelling#Nuclear fusion in stars|tunnel]] through coulomb forces.

When a [[nucleon]] such as a [[proton]] or [[neutron]] is added to a nucleus, the nuclear force attracts it to all the other nucleons of the nucleus (if the atom is small enough), but primarily to its immediate neighbours due to the short range of the force. The nucleons in the interior of a nucleus have more neighboring nucleons than those on the surface. Since smaller nuclei have a larger surface area-to-volume ratio, the binding energy per nucleon due to the [[nuclear force]] generally increases with the size of the nucleus but approaches a limiting value corresponding to that of a nucleus with a diameter of about four nucleons. It is important to keep in mind that nucleons are [[Quantum physics|quantum objects]]. So, for example, since two neutrons in a nucleus are identical to each other, the goal of distinguishing one from the other, such as which one is in the interior and which is on the surface, is in fact meaningless, and the inclusion of quantum mechanics is therefore necessary for proper calculations.

The electrostatic force, on the other hand, is an [[inverse square law|inverse-square force]], so a proton added to a nucleus will feel an electrostatic repulsion from ''all'' the other protons in the nucleus. The electrostatic energy per nucleon due to the electrostatic force thus increases without limit as nuclei atomic number grows.

[[Image:Nuclear fusion forces diagram.svg|left|350px|thumb|The [[electrostatic force]] between the positively charged nuclei is repulsive, but when the separation is small enough, the quantum effect will tunnel through the wall.  Therefore, the prerequisite for fusion is that the two nuclei be brought close enough together for a long enough time for quantum tunnelling to act.]]

The net result of the opposing electrostatic and strong nuclear forces is that the binding energy per nucleon generally increases with increasing size, up to the elements [[iron]] and [[nickel]], and then decreases for heavier nuclei. Eventually, the [[binding energy]] becomes negative and very heavy nuclei (all with more than 208 nucleons, corresponding to a diameter of about 6 nucleons) are not stable. The four most tightly bound nuclei, in decreasing order of [[binding energy]] per nucleon, are {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Nickel|62}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Iron|58}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Iron|56}}, and {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Nickel|60}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/nucbin2.html#c1 The Most Tightly Bound Nuclei]. Hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu. Retrieved on 2011-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the [[isotopes of nickel|nickel isotope]], {{SimpleNuclide2|Nickel|62}}, is more stable, the [[isotopes of iron|iron isotope]] {{SimpleNuclide2|Iron|56}} is an [[order of magnitude]] more common. This is due to the fact that there is no easy way for stars to create {{SimpleNuclide2|Nickel|62}} through the alpha process.

An exception to this general trend is the [[helium-4]] nucleus, whose binding energy is higher than that of [[lithium]], the next heaviest element. This is because protons and neutrons are [[fermion]]s, which according to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] cannot exist in the same nucleus in exactly the same state. Each proton or neutron's energy state in a nucleus can accommodate both a spin up particle and a spin down particle. Helium-4 has an anomalously large binding energy because its nucleus consists of two protons and two neutrons, so all four of its nucleons can be in the ground state. Any additional nucleons would have to go into higher energy states.  Indeed, the helium-4 nucleus is so tightly bound that it is commonly treated as a single quantum mechanical particle in nuclear physics, namely, the [[alpha particle]].

The situation is similar if two nuclei are brought together. As they approach each other, all the protons in one nucleus repel all the protons in the other. Not until the two nuclei actually come close enough for long enough so the strong [[nuclear force]] can take over (by way of tunneling) is the repulsive electrostatic force overcome. Consequently, even when the final energy state is lower, there is a large energy barrier that must first be overcome. It is called the [[Coulomb barrier]].

The Coulomb barrier is smallest for isotopes of hydrogen, as their nuclei contain only a single positive charge. A [[diproton]] is not stable, so neutrons must also be involved, ideally in such a way that a helium nucleus, with its extremely tight binding, is one of the products.

Using [[Tritium#Deuterium|deuterium-tritium]] fuel, the resulting energy barrier is about 0.1&amp;nbsp;MeV. In comparison, the energy needed to remove an [[electron]] from [[hydrogen]] is 13.6&amp;nbsp;eV, about 7500 times less energy. The (intermediate) result of the fusion is an unstable &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;He nucleus, which immediately ejects a neutron with 14.1&amp;nbsp;MeV. The recoil energy of the remaining &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He nucleus is 3.5&amp;nbsp;MeV, so the total energy liberated is 17.6&amp;nbsp;MeV. This is many times more than what was needed to overcome the energy barrier.

[[Image:fusion rxnrate.svg|right|300px|thumb|The fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes and then gradually drops off. The DT rate peaks at a lower temperature (about 70&amp;nbsp;keV, or 800 million kelvin) and at a higher value than other reactions commonly considered for fusion energy.]]

The reaction '''[[cross section (physics)|cross section]]''' σ is a measure of the probability of a fusion reaction as a function of the relative velocity of the two reactant nuclei. If the reactants have a distribution of velocities, e.g. a thermal distribution, then it is useful to perform an average over the distributions of the product of cross section and velocity. This average is called the 'reactivity', denoted &lt;σv&gt;. The reaction rate (fusions per volume per time) is &lt;σv&gt; times the product of the reactant number densities:

:&lt;math&gt;f = n_1 n_2 \langle \sigma v \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

If a species of nuclei is reacting with a nucleus like itself, such as the DD reaction, then the product &lt;math&gt;n_1n_2&lt;/math&gt; must be replaced by &lt;math&gt;(1/2)n^2&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\langle \sigma v \rangle&lt;/math&gt; increases from virtually zero at room temperatures up to meaningful magnitudes at temperatures of [[1 E-15 J|10]]–[[1 E-14 J|100]]&amp;nbsp;keV. At these temperatures, well above typical [[ion]]ization energies (13.6&amp;nbsp;eV in the hydrogen case), the fusion reactants exist in a [[Plasma physics|plasma]] state.

The significance of &lt;math&gt;\langle \sigma v \rangle&lt;/math&gt; as a function of temperature in a device with a particular energy [[confinement time]] is found by considering the [[Lawson criterion]].  This is an extremely challenging barrier to overcome on Earth, which explains why fusion research has taken many years to reach the current advanced technical state.&lt;ref name=lawson&gt;[http://www.scienceworldreport.com/articles/5763/20130323/lawson-criteria-make-fusion-power-viable-iter.htm What Is The Lawson Criteria, Or How to Make Fusion Power Viable&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beam-beam or beam-target fusion===
If the energy to initiate the reaction comes from [[particle accelerator|accelerating]] one of the nuclei, the process is called ''beam-target'' fusion; if both nuclei are accelerated, it is ''beam-beam'' fusion.

Accelerator-based light-ion fusion is a technique using particle accelerators to achieve particle kinetic energies sufficient to induce light-ion fusion reactions. Accelerating light ions is relatively easy, and can be done in an efficient manner—requiring only a vacuum tube, a pair of electrodes, and a high-voltage transformer; fusion can be observed with as little as 10 kV between the electrodes. The key problem with accelerator-based fusion (and with cold targets in general) is that fusion cross sections are many orders of magnitude lower than Coulomb interaction cross sections. Therefore, the vast majority of ions expend their energy emitting [[bremsstrahlung]] radiation and the ionization of atoms of the target. Devices referred to as sealed-tube [[neutron generator]]s are particularly relevant to this discussion. These small devices are miniature particle accelerators filled with deuterium and tritium gas in an arrangement that allows ions of those nuclei to be accelerated against hydride targets, also containing deuterium and tritium, where fusion takes place, releasing a flux of neutrons. Hundreds of neutron generators are produced annually for use in the petroleum industry where they are used in measurement equipment for locating and mapping oil reserves.

===Muon-catalyzed fusion===
[[Muon-catalyzed fusion]] is a fusion process that occurs at ordinary temperatures. It was studied in detail by [[Steven E. Jones|Steven Jones]] in the early 1980s. Net energy production from this reaction has been unsuccessful because of the high energy required to create [[muon]]s, their short 2.2&amp;nbsp;µs [[half-life]], and the high chance that a muon will bind to the new [[alpha particle]] and thus stop catalyzing fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jones, S.E. |title=Muon-Catalysed Fusion Revisited |journal=Nature |volume=321 |pages=127–133 |year=1986 |doi=10.1038/321127a0|bibcode = 1986Natur.321..127J |issue=6066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other principles===
[[File:TCV vue gen.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Tokamak à configuration variable]]'', research fusion reactor, at the [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]] (Switzerland).]]

Some other confinement principles have been investigated.

[[Antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion|Antimatter-initialized fusion]] uses small amounts of [[antimatter]] to trigger a tiny fusion explosion. This has been studied primarily in the context of making [[nuclear pulse propulsion]], and [[pure fusion bomb]]s feasible. This is not near becoming a practical power source, due to the cost of manufacturing antimatter alone.

[[Pyroelectric fusion]] was reported in April 2005 by a team at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. The scientists used a [[pyroelectricity|pyroelectric]] crystal heated from −34 to 7&amp;nbsp;°C (−29 to 45&amp;nbsp;°F), combined with a [[tungsten]] needle to produce an [[electric field]] of about 25&amp;nbsp;gigavolts per meter to ionize and accelerate [[deuterium]] nuclei into an [[erbium]] deuteride target.  At the estimated energy levels,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v434/n7037/suppinfo/nature03575.html Supplementary methods for "Observation of nuclear fusion driven by a pyroelectric crystal"].

Although it makes a useful neutron generator, the apparatus is not intended for power generation since it requires far more energy than it produces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rodan.physics.ucla.edu/pyrofusion/ UCLA Crystal Fusion].

[[Nuclear fusion-fission hybrid|Hybrid nuclear fusion-fission (hybrid nuclear power)]] is a proposed means of generating [[Electrical power industry|power]]  by use of a combination of nuclear fusion and [[Nuclear fission|fission]] processes. The concept dates to the 1950s, and was briefly advocated by [[Hans Bethe]] during the 1970s, but largely remained unexplored until a revival of interest in 2009, due to the delays in the realization of pure fusion.&lt;ref name="hybrid"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gerstner, E. | title = Nuclear energy: The hybrid returns | year = 2009 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 460 | issue = 7251| pages = 25–8 | pmid = 19571861|doi=10.1038/460025a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Project PACER]], carried out at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL) in the mid-1970s, explored the possibility of a fusion power system that would involve exploding small [[H-bomb|hydrogen bomb]]s (fusion bombs) inside an underground cavity. As an energy source, the system is the only fusion power system that could be demonstrated to work using existing technology. However it would also require a large, continuous supply of nuclear bombs, making the economics of such a system rather questionable.

===Astrophysical reaction chains===
At the temperatures and densities in stellar cores the rates of fusion reactions are notoriously slow. For example, at solar core temperature (''T'' ≈ 15&amp;nbsp;MK) and density (160&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), the energy release rate is only 276&amp;nbsp;μW/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;—about a quarter of the volumetric rate at which a resting human body generates heat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fusedweb.pppl.gov/CPEP/Chart_Pages/5.Plasmas/SunLayers.html FusEdWeb | Fusion Education]. Fusedweb.pppl.gov (1998-11-09). Retrieved on 2011-08-17. {{Dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, reproduction of stellar core conditions in a lab for nuclear fusion power production is completely impractical. Because nuclear reaction rates depend on density as well as temperature and most fusion schemes operate at relatively low densities, those methods are strongly dependent on higher temperatures. The fusion rate as a function of temperature (exp(−''E''/''kT'')), leads to the need to achieve temperatures in terrestrial reactors 10–100 times higher temperatures than in stellar interiors: ''T'' ≈ 0.1–1.0×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; K.

===Criteria and candidates for terrestrial reactions===
{{main article|Fusion power#Fuels}}
In artificial fusion, the primary fuel is not constrained to be protons and higher temperatures can be used, so reactions with larger cross-sections are chosen. Another concern is the production of neutrons, which activate the reactor structure radiologically, but also have the advantages of allowing volumetric extraction of the fusion energy and [[tritium]] breeding. Reactions that release no neutrons are referred to as [[Aneutronic fusion|''aneutronic'']].

To be a useful energy source, a fusion reaction must satisfy several criteria. It must:

;Be [[exothermic]]: This limits the reactants to the low ''Z'' (number of protons) side of the [[Nuclear binding energy#Nuclear binding energy curve|curve of binding energy]]. It also makes helium {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Helium|4}} the most common product because of its extraordinarily tight binding, although {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Helium|3}} and {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Hydrogen|3}} also show up.
;Involve low atomic number (''Z'') nuclei: This is because the electrostatic repulsion that must be overcome before the nuclei are close enough to fuse is directly related to the number of protons it contains - its atomic number.{{citation needed|date=November 2015|reason=This implies a relationship between atomic number (Z) and activation energy (in addition to its relation to binding energy), which isn't established/cited here.}}
;Have two reactants: At anything less than stellar densities, three body collisions are too improbable. In inertial confinement, both stellar densities and temperatures are exceeded to compensate for the shortcomings of the third parameter of the Lawson criterion, ICF's very short confinement time.
;Have two or more products: This allows simultaneous conservation of energy and momentum without relying on the electromagnetic force.
;Conserve both protons and neutrons: The cross sections for the weak interaction are too small.

Few reactions meet these criteria. The following are those with the largest cross sections:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Nucleosynthesis}}

For reactions with two products, the energy is divided between them in inverse proportion to their masses, as shown. In most reactions with three products, the distribution of energy varies. For reactions that can result in more than one set of products, the branching ratios are given.

Some reaction candidates can be eliminated at once. The D-&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li reaction has no advantage compared to [[Proton|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|Boron|11}} because it is roughly as difficult to burn but produces substantially more neutrons through {{nuclide|link=yes|Deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|Deuterium}} side reactions. There is also a [[Proton|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|Lithium|7}} reaction, but the cross section is far too low, except possibly when ''T''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1 MeV, but at such high temperatures an endothermic, direct neutron-producing reaction also becomes very significant. Finally there is also a [[Proton|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|Beryllium|9}} reaction, which is not only difficult to burn, but {{nuclide|link=yes|Beryllium|9}} can be easily induced to split into two alpha particles and a neutron.

In addition to the fusion reactions, the following reactions with neutrons are important in order to "breed" tritium in "dry" fusion bombs and some proposed fusion reactors:

The latter of the two equations was unknown when the U.S. conducted the [[Castle Bravo]] fusion bomb test in 1954. Being just the second fusion bomb ever tested (and the first to use lithium), the designers of the Castle Bravo "Shrimp" had understood the usefulness of Lithium-6 in tritium production, but had failed to recognize that Lithium-7 fission would greatly increase the yield of the bomb. While Li-7 has a small neutron cross-section for low neutron energies, it has a higher cross section above 5 MeV.&lt;ref name=cross_section&gt;[http://www.kayelaby.npl.co.uk/atomic_and_nuclear_physics/4_7/4_7_4c.html Subsection 4.7.4c].

To evaluate the usefulness of these reactions, in addition to the reactants, the products, and the energy released, one needs to know something about the cross section. Any given fusion device has a maximum plasma pressure it can sustain, and an economical device would always operate near this maximum. Given this pressure, the largest fusion output is obtained when the temperature is chosen so that &lt;σv&gt;/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a maximum. This is also the temperature at which the value of the triple product ''nT''τ required for [[Fusion energy gain factor#Ignition|ignition]] is a minimum, since that required value is inversely proportional to &lt;σv&gt;/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (see [[Lawson criterion]]). (A plasma is "ignited" if the fusion reactions produce enough power to maintain the temperature without external heating.) This optimum temperature and the value of &lt;σv&gt;/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at that temperature is given for a few of these reactions in the following table.

Note that many of the reactions form chains. For instance, a reactor fueled with {{nuclide|tritium}} and {{nuclide|helium|3}} creates some {{nuclide|deuterium}}, which is then possible to use in the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}} reaction if the energies are "right". An elegant idea is to combine the reactions (8) and (9). The {{nuclide|helium|3}} from reaction (8) can react with {{nuclide|lithium|6}} in reaction (9) before completely thermalizing. This produces an energetic proton, which in turn undergoes reaction (8) before thermalizing. Detailed analysis shows that this idea would not work well,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} but it is a good example of a case where the usual assumption of a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]] plasma is not appropriate.

===Neutronicity, confinement requirement, and power density===
[[Image:IvyMike2.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The only man-made fusion device to achieve [[Fusion gain factor|ignition]] to date is the [[hydrogen bomb]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}  The detonation of the first device, codenamed [[Ivy Mike]], occurred in 1952 and is shown here.]]
Any of the reactions above can in principle be the basis of [[fusion power]] production. In addition to the temperature and cross section discussed above, we must consider the total energy of the fusion products ''E''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;, the energy of the charged fusion products ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt;, and the atomic number ''Z'' of the non-hydrogenic reactant.

Specification of the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction entails some difficulties, though. To begin with, one must average over the two branches (2i) and (2ii). More difficult is to decide how to treat the {{nuclide|tritium}} and {{nuclide|helium|3}} products. {{nuclide|tritium}} burns so well in a deuterium plasma that it is almost impossible to extract from the plasma. The {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}} reaction is optimized at a much higher temperature, so the burnup at the optimum {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} temperature may be low. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume the {{nuclide|tritium}} but not the {{nuclide|helium|3}} gets burned up and adds its energy to the net reaction, which means the total reaction would be the sum of (2i), (2ii), and (1):

:5 {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}} → {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|4}} + 2 [[Neutron|n&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;]] + {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}} + [[Proton|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]],  ''E''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.03+17.6+3.27 = 24.9&amp;nbsp;MeV, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.03+3.5+0.82 = 8.35&amp;nbsp;MeV.

For calculating the power of a reactor (in which the reaction rate is determined by the D-D step), we count the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} fusion energy ''per D-D reaction'' as ''E''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; = (4.03&amp;nbsp;MeV + 17.6&amp;nbsp;MeV)×50% + (3.27&amp;nbsp;MeV)×50% = 12.5&amp;nbsp;MeV and the energy in charged particles as ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt; = (4.03&amp;nbsp;MeV + 3.5&amp;nbsp;MeV)×50% + (0.82&amp;nbsp;MeV)×50% = 4.2&amp;nbsp;MeV. (Note: if the tritium ion reacts with a deuteron while it still has a large kinetic energy, then the kinetic energy of the helium-4 produced may be quite different from 3.5 MeV,&lt;ref&gt;A momentum and energy balance shows that if the tritium has an energy of E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; (and using relative masses of 1, 3, and 4 for the neutron, tritium, and helium) then the energy of the helium can be anything from [(12E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;−(5×17.6MeV+2×E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/25 to [(12E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;+(5×17.6MeV+2×E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/25. For E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;=1.01&amp;nbsp;MeV this gives a range from 1.44&amp;nbsp;MeV to 6.73&amp;nbsp;MeV.&lt;/ref&gt; so this calculation of energy in charged particles is only an approximation of the average.) The amount of energy per deuteron consumed is 2/5 of this, or 5.0&amp;nbsp;MeV (a [[specific energy]] of about 225 million [[Megajoule|MJ]] per kilogram of deuterium).

Another unique aspect of the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction is that there is only one reactant, which must be taken into account when calculating the reaction rate.

With this choice, we tabulate parameters for four of the most important reactions

|}

The last column is the '''[[aneutronic fusion|neutronicity]]''' of the reaction, the fraction of the fusion energy released as neutrons. This is an important indicator of the magnitude of the problems associated with neutrons like radiation damage, biological shielding, remote handling, and safety. For the first two reactions it is calculated as (''E''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;-''E''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt;)/''E''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;. For the last two reactions, where this calculation would give zero, the values quoted are rough estimates based on side reactions that produce neutrons in a plasma in thermal equilibrium.

Of course, the reactants should also be mixed in the optimal proportions. This is the case when each reactant ion plus its associated electrons accounts for half the pressure. Assuming that the total pressure is fixed, this means that particle density of the non-hydrogenic ion is smaller than that of the hydrogenic ion by a factor 2/(''Z''+1). Therefore, the rate for these reactions is reduced by the same factor, on top of any differences in the values of &lt;σv&gt;/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. On the other hand, because the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction has only one reactant, its rate is twice as high as when the fuel is divided between two different hydrogenic species, thus creating a more efficient reaction.

Thus there is a "penalty" of (2/(Z+1)) for non-hydrogenic fuels arising from the fact that they require more electrons, which take up pressure without participating in the fusion reaction. (It is usually a good assumption that the electron temperature will be nearly equal to the ion temperature. Some authors, however discuss the possibility that the electrons could be maintained substantially colder than the ions. In such a case, known as a "hot ion mode", the "penalty" would not apply.) There is at the same time a "bonus" of a factor 2 for {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} because each ion can react with any of the other ions, not just a fraction of them.

We can now compare these reactions in the following table.

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:auto;"

|}

The maximum value of &lt;σv&gt;/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is taken from a previous table. The "penalty/bonus" factor is that related to a non-hydrogenic reactant or a single-species reaction. The values in the column "inverse reactivity" are found by dividing 1.24{{e|-24}} by the product of the second and third columns. It indicates the factor by which the other reactions occur more slowly than the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction under comparable conditions. The column "[[Lawson criterion]]" weights these results with ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt; and gives an indication of how much more difficult it is to achieve ignition with these reactions, relative to the difficulty for the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction. The next-to-last column is labeled "power density" and weights the practical reactivity by ''E''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;. The final column indicates how much lower the fusion power density of the other reactions is compared to the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction and can be considered a measure of the economic potential.

===Bremsstrahlung losses in quasineutral, isotropic plasmas===
The ions undergoing fusion in many systems will essentially never occur alone but will be mixed with [[electron]]s that in aggregate neutralize the ions' bulk [[electrical charge]] and form a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The electrons will generally have a temperature comparable to or greater than that of the ions, so they will collide with the ions and emit [[x-ray]] radiation of 10–30 keV energy, a process known as [[Bremsstrahlung]].

The huge size of the Sun and stars means that the x-rays produced in this process will not escape and will deposit their energy back into the plasma. They are said to be [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] to x-rays. But any terrestrial fusion reactor will be [[Optical depth|optically thin]] for x-rays of this energy range. X-rays are difficult to reflect but they are effectively absorbed (and converted into heat) in less than mm thickness of stainless steel (which is part of a reactor's shield). This means the bremsstrahlung process is carrying energy out of the plasma, cooling it.
 
The ratio of fusion power produced to x-ray radiation lost to walls is an important figure of merit. This ratio is generally maximized at a much higher temperature than that which maximizes the power density (see the previous subsection). The following table shows estimates of the optimum temperature and the power ratio at that temperature for several reactions:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:auto;"

|-
|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-{{nuclide|boron|11}}       ||  300 ||   0.57
|}

The actual ratios of fusion to Bremsstrahlung power will likely be significantly lower for several reasons. For one, the calculation assumes that the energy of the fusion products is transmitted completely to the fuel ions, which then lose energy to the electrons by collisions, which in turn lose energy by Bremsstrahlung. However, because the fusion products move much faster than the fuel ions, they will give up a significant fraction of their energy directly to the electrons. Secondly, the ions in the plasma are assumed to be purely fuel ions. In practice, there will be a significant proportion of impurity ions, which will then lower the ratio. In particular, the fusion products themselves ''must'' remain in the plasma until they have given up their energy, and ''will'' remain some time after that in any proposed confinement scheme. Finally, all channels of energy loss other than Bremsstrahlung have been neglected. The last two factors are related. On theoretical and experimental grounds, particle and energy confinement seem to be closely related. In a confinement scheme that does a good job of retaining energy, fusion products will build up. If the fusion products are efficiently ejected, then energy confinement will be poor, too.

The temperatures maximizing the fusion power compared to the Bremsstrahlung are in every case higher than the temperature that maximizes the power density and minimizes the required value of the [[Lawson criterion|fusion triple product]]. This will not change the optimum operating point for {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} very much because the Bremsstrahlung fraction is low, but it will push the other fuels into regimes where the power density relative to {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} is even lower and the required confinement even more difficult to achieve. For {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}} and {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}, Bremsstrahlung losses will be a serious, possibly prohibitive problem. For {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}, [[Proton|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|lithium|6}} and [[Proton|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|boron|11}} the Bremsstrahlung losses appear to make a fusion reactor using these fuels with a quasineutral, isotropic plasma impossible. Some ways out of this dilemma are considered—and rejected—in ''fundamental limitations on plasma fusion systems not in thermodynamic equilibrium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fundamental Limitations on Plasma Fusion Systems not in Thermodynamic Equilibrium|journal=Dissertation Abstracts International|volume= 56-07 |issue=Section B|page= 3820|author=Rider, Todd Harrison|bibcode=1995PhDT........45R|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rostoker, Norman; Binderbauer, Michl and Qerushi,

== Mathematical description of cross section ==

=== Fusion under classical physics ===
In a classical picture, nuclei can be understood as hard spheres that repel each other through the Coulomb force but fuse once the two spheres come close enough for contact. Estimating the radius of an atomic nuclei as about one femtometer, the energy needed for fusion of two hydrogen is:

&lt;math&gt;E_{\text{thresh}}= \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{Z_1 Z_2}{r} \xrightarrow{\text{2 protons}} \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{1 \text{ fm}} \approx 1.4 \text{ MeV}&lt;/math&gt;

This would imply that for the core of the sun, which has a [[Boltzmann distribution]] with a temperature of around 1.4 keV, the probability hydrogen would reach the threshold is &lt;math&gt;10^{-290}&lt;/math&gt;, that is, fusion would never occur. However, fusion in the sun does occur due to quantum mechanics.

=== Parameterization of cross section ===
The probability that fusion occurs is greatly increased compared to the classical picture, thanks to the smearing of the effective radius as the [[Matter wave|DeBroglie wavelength]] as well as [[quantum tunnelling]] through the potential barrier. To determine the rate of fusion reactions, the value of most interest is the [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]], which describes the probability that particle will fuse by giving a characteristic area of interaction.  An estimation of the fusion cross sectional area is often broken into three pieces:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma \approx \sigma_{geometry} \times T \times R&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{geometry} &lt;/math&gt; is the geometric cross section, {{mvar|T}} is the barrier transparency and {{mvar|R}} is the reaction characteristics of the reaction. 

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{geometry} &lt;/math&gt; is of the order of the square of the de-Broglie wavelength &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{geometry} \approx \lambda^2 = \bigg( \frac{\hbar^2}{m_r v} \bigg)^2 \propto \frac{1}{\epsilon} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m_r &lt;/math&gt; is the reduced mass of the system and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon  &lt;/math&gt; is the center of mass energy of the system. 

{{mvar|T}} can be approximated by the Gamow transparency, which has the form: &lt;math&gt;T \approx e^ {- \sqrt{\epsilon_G /\epsilon} } &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_G = ( \pi \alpha Z_1 Z_2)^2 \times 2 m_r c^2 &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gamow factor]] and comes from estimating the quantum tunneling probability through the potential barrier. 

{{mvar|R}} contains all the nuclear physics of the specific reaction and takes very different values depending on the nature of the interaction. However, for most reactions, the variation of &lt;math&gt;R(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; is small compared to the variation from the Gamow factor and so is approximated by a function called the [[S-factor|Astrophysical S-factor]], &lt;math&gt;S(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;, which is weakly varying in energy. Putting these dependencies together, one approximation for the fusion cross section as a function of energy takes the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(\epsilon) \approx \frac{S(\epsilon)}{\epsilon} e^{ - \sqrt{ \epsilon_G/\epsilon}}&lt;/math&gt;

More detailed forms of the cross section can be derived through nuclear physics based models and R matrix theory.

=== Formulas of fusion cross sections ===

'''O'Reilly General Hospital''' was an army hospital created by the U.S. Government in February 1941. It was built in [[Springfield, Missouri]] to provide long-term medical care for returning soldiers of [[World War II]]. It became known as "The hospital with a soul."

== History ==
[[File:Colonel George B. Foster, Jr.tif|left|thumb|212x212px|Post Commander Colonel George B. Foster, Jr]]
Hospital got its name from former Surgeon Gen. Robert Maitland O’Reilly.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2016/12/21/oreilly-general-army-hospital-crown-jewel-world-war-ii-army-hospitals/95658570/|title=O'Reilly General Army Hospital crown jewel of World War II army hospitals|work=Springfield News-Leader|access-date=2017-09-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location was chosen in February 1941. The commander of the post was Colonel George B. Foster Jr. who declared on May 15, 1941 that it should be a "hospital with a soul."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thelibrary.org/lochist/oreilly/intro.cfm|title=O'Reilly General Hospital -- Springfield's Hospital With a Soul|last=Glenn|first=Michael|date=|website=thelibrary.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was dedicated on November 8, 1941 with room for 1,000 beds.

A 160-acre area of land was selected for the site. Already built on the land was a "[[Pythian Home of Missouri|castle]]" built by the [[Knights of Pythias]]. The castle was bought from the Knights of Pythias for $40,625 (half its assessed value) using an order of immediate possession.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ccheadliner.com/nixa/news/the-castle-and-the-army-hospital/article_805a6fdf-a61d-55df-99aa-58048786c2a4.html|title=The castle and the Army hospital|last=Johns|first=Paul|date=October 2011|work=CCHeadliner.com|access-date=2017-09-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle was renovated and converted into the Enlisted Men's Service Club.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The army built a ballroom, bowling alley and gymnasium inside of the building. Part of the basement was converted into a prison for Italian and German prisoners who required medical care.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The hospital began to conduct training for field medics. Many of the patients treated had severe burns. The hospital began using new innovations in plastic surgery to help the burn victims. It became a primary provider of reconstructive surgery and physical therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Carter|first=Thomas A|title=O'Reilly General Hospital: the hospital with a soul|date=2012|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/oreilly-general-hospital-the-hospital-with-a-soul/oclc/793394285|last2=|last3=|last4=|last5=|last6=|last7=|last8=|last9=|first2=|first3=|first4=|first5=|first6=|first7=|first8=|first9=|publisher=Ozarks Public Television|language=English|accessdate=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the winter of 1944, area residents worked to makes sure all the patents in the hospital had presents.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thelibrary.org/lochist/oreilly/fiftyplus.cfm|title=O'Reilly General Hospital Of Springfield Missouri|last=Rutherford|first=John|date=February 2002|website=thelibrary.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== After the war ===
On September 30, 1946, at the end of the war, the hospital closed and ceased being operated as by the army.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The United States Veterans Administration reopened it in February 1947. The closed it down again in August 1952. It was then declared surplus property by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.evangel.edu/about/about-evangel/history/|title=History - Evangel University {{!}} Springfield, MO {{!}} Missouri Christian Colleges|work=Evangel University|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site remained unused until the [[Assemblies of God USA|General Council of the Assemblies of God]] bought most of the property in December 1954.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Part of the grounds are now the armory for the Army reserve and National Guard.

== Faculties ==
The army initially built 91 buildings for the hospital. It was eventually expanded to 258 buildings and 3,426 beds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  They offered an occupation classes for staff and patients to learn new skills and take high-school exams.

== Location ==
It was built between the roads of Division and Glenstone Avenue. The location is now occupied by the Army Reserve, Army National Guard and Evangel University.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
The army Army [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|Surgeon General]] recognized the army hospital as the "best in the Nation."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Over 100,000 patients were treated over its five-year period of operation. The hospital became a model for other army hospitals. The average cost per patient was five dollars a day.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Average recovery time dropped to 24 days from and average of 35 days.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''OSO 7''' or '''Orbiting Solar Observatory 7''' (NSSDC ID: '''1971-083A'''), before launch known as '''OSO H''' is the seventh in the series of American [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]] satellites launched by NASA between 1962 and 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heasarc.nasa.gov/docs/oso7/oso7.html OSO 7 ] NASA HEASARC&lt;/ref&gt;  OSO 7 was launched from Cape Canaveral on 29 September 1971 by a [[Delta (rocket)|Delta N]] rocket into a 33.1° inclination, low-Earth (initially 321 by 572&amp;nbsp;km) orbit, and re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on 9 July 1974. 
It was built by the [[Ball Brothers Research Corporation]] (BBRC), now known as [[Ball Aerospace]], in Boulder Colorado.

While the basic design of all the OSO satellites was similar, the OSO 7 was larger [total spacecraft mass was 635&amp;nbsp;kg (1397&amp;nbsp;lb)] than the OSO 1 through OSO 6, with a larger squared-off solar array in the non-rotating "Sail", and a deeper rotating section, the "Wheel".&lt;ref&gt;[http://heasarc.nasa.gov/Images/oso/oso7_flight.gif OSO 7 in orbit] A photograph of the OSO 7 taken before launch, on a black background as it might have appeared in space.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sail instruments==
The "Sail" portion of the spacecraft, which was stabilized to face the Sun in all the [[Orbiting Solar Observatory|OSO]] series satellites, carried two instruments on OSO 7, which continuously viewed the Sun during orbit day.
These were:

* The [[Goddard Spaceflight Center|GSFC]] X-Ray and EUV Spectroheliograph (covering the wavelength range 2 to 400 [[Ångström|Å]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1971-083A-01 X-Ray and EUV Spectroheliograph (2 to 400 Å)]&lt;/ref&gt; under the direction of P.I. Dr. Werner M. Neupert of the NASA GSFC which imaged the Sun in the Extreme Ultraviolet and soft X-ray bands, to determine the temperature and distribution of matter in the [[corona]] above active regions and during solar flares.
* The [[United States Naval Research Laboratory|NRL]] White-Light Coronagraph and Extreme Ultraviolet Corona Experiment, directed by Dr. Richard Tousey of the US Naval Research Laboratory,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.go/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1971-083A-02 NSSDC OSO 7 White-Light Coronagraph and Extreme Ultraviolet Corona Experiment]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which imaged the while light corona, using an occulting disk, allowing comparison between the structure of the corona and the active regions on the solar surface.

==Wheel instruments==
The rotating "Wheel" component of the spacecraft, which provided overall gyroscopic stability to the satellite, carried four instruments, which looked radially outwards and scanned across the Sun every 2 seconds.
Two of these were solar-observing instruments, and the other two were cosmic X-ray instruments:
* [[UCSD]] Hard Solar X-Ray Monitoring instrument, P.I. Prof. [[Laurence E. Peterson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1971-083A-05 Hard Solar X-Ray Monitoring instrument].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Harrington et al., IEEE. Trans. Nucl. Sci., v. NS-19, p. 596, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; covered the 2—300 [[keV]] energy range using proportional counter and NaI scintillator detectors, plus three small charged-particle detectors for monitoring the local radiation environment.
* [[University of New Hampshire|UNH]] Solar Gamma-Ray Monitor. P.I. Prof. Edward Chupp,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1971-083A-06 Solar Gamma-Ray Monitor].&lt;/ref&gt; observed 0.3—10 [[MeV]] [[solar flare]] gamma rays with a NaI(Tl) scintillation [[Gamma ray spectroscopy|spectrometer]] in a CsI(Na) active [[Electronic anticoincidence|anti-coincidence]] shield.&lt;ref&gt;P. R. Hignie et al., IEEE Trans. Nucl. Sci., v. NS-19, p. 606, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[MIT]] Cosmic X-Ray Experiment, P.I. Prof. George W. Clarke, observed cosmic X-ray sources in the range 1.5 to 9 Å.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1971-083A-04 Cosmic X-Ray Sources in the Range 1.5 to 9 Å].&lt;/ref&gt;  This instrument used proportional counters to observe cosmic X-ray sources in the 1 to 60 keV range, in five broad logarithmically spaced energy bands, with about 1° angular resolution.&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Clark et al., Ap. J., v. 179, p. 263, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;
* UCSD Cosmic X-ray Experiment, P.I. Prof. Laurence E. Peterson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1971-083A-03 Cosmic X-ray Experiment].&lt;/ref&gt; This instrument, which had a field of view ([[Full width at half maximum|FWHM]]) about 6°, looked out perpendicular to the Wheel spin axis, sweeping a great circle on the sky every 2 seconds.  As the Wheel spin axis moved to keep the Sail instruments pointed at the Sun, it scanned the whole sky every 6 months.  It featured a 1&amp;nbsp;cm thick NaI(Tl) scintillation detector that covered the energy range from ~7 keV to ~500 keV in 126 PHA channels, with an effective area of 100&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at the lower energies.  The detector was enclosed in a thick CsI(Na) anti-coincidence scintillation shield with 10 holes bored through it, which defined the optical field of view of the detector.  Events were individually recorded and telemetered, with time and pulse height tagged for each, at a maximal rate of 3.2 per second.&lt;ref&gt;M. P. Ulmer et al., Ap. J., v. 178, p. L61, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific results==
Among the notable scientific results from OSO 7 were:&lt;ref&gt;[http://heasarc.nasa.gov/docs/oso7/bib/oso7_biblio.html OSO 7 Bibliography]&lt;/ref&gt;

* All-sky hard X-ray surveys by the MIT and UCSD cosmic instruments.
* The first observation of solar gamma-ray line emission, due to electron/positron annihilation at 511 keV, from a solar flare in [[Solar storm of August 1972|August 1972]], by the UNH spectrometer.
* The [[Coronal mass ejection#First clear detections|first clear detection]] of a [[coronal mass ejection | coronal mass ejection (CME)]], by the NRL instrument.
* Observations of the hard X-ray spectra of the [[Active galactic nucleus|AGN]] [[NGC 4151]]&lt;ref&gt;Baity et al., Astrophys. J. (Letters) 199:L5, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cen A]]&lt;ref&gt;Mushotzky  et al., Astrophys. J. (Letters) 206:L45-L48, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;
* Position and spectral variability of the 14 May 1972 cosmic gamma-ray burst&lt;ref&gt;Wheaton, Wm. A., Ulmer, M. P., Baity, W. A., Datlowe, D. W., Elcan, M. J., Peterson, L. E., Klebesadel, R. W., Strong, T. B., Cline, T., L. and Desai, U. D. "The Direction and Spectral Variability of a Cosmic Gamma-Ray Burst", Ap.J. Lett. 185:L57, 15 Oct. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Near loss at launch==
The OSO 7 was nearly lost at launch, due to a loss of hydraulic pressure in the second-stage guidance control system ~7 seconds prior to [[Multistage rocket|SECO]].  The nominal plan was for the spacecraft to be separated from the second stage with the spin axis normal to the Sun direction, so that the sail could be oriented to the Sun, allowing the batteries to be fully charged on orbit.  As it was, the orbit was slightly eccentric instead of circular, and the orientation of the spacecraft immediately after launch was unknown, so that the sail could not acquire Sun lock.  The spacecraft was launched with its batteries fully charged, giving approximately 12 hours for the controllers, directed by NASA's John Thole, to recover before the spacecraft lost power and command ability.  Several hours passed as engineers attempted to interpret the signal strength from the tumbling spacecraft in terms of its transmitting antenna pattern.  Finally, an hour or two before the end, Thole decided to abandon caution and "start slewing", and by luck and skill, control was regained.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4012/vol3/table1.32.htm ] SP-4012 NASA HISTORICAL DATA BOOK: VOLUME III&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the resulting orbital apogee was ~572&amp;nbsp;km instead of the planned ~350&amp;nbsp;km for the nominal circular orbit, several times each day OSO 7 passed fairly deeply into the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, so that bombardment by high energy [[proton]]s made it somewhat radioactive.  The activity then decayed slowly during other times of the day.  The complexly varying instrument internal radioactivity complicated the analysis of data from the sensitive X-ray and gamma-ray instruments on board.

==P78-1==
The flight spare for OSO H was later acquired by the U.S. Air Force, modified and re-instrumented, and then launched in 1979 as [[P78-1]] (also known as Solwind), the satellite which was shot down by the USAF in a successful anti-satellite missile test in 1985.  OSO 7 and P78-1 were not identical in appearance, but more similar to each other than either were to the earlier OSO 1 through OSO 6 spacecraft, or to the final OSO 8.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/sats_n_data/missions/oso8.html OSO 8, with image showing differences from OSO 7 and P78-1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Offshore Energy and Jobs Act''' ({{USBill|113|H.R.|2231}}) is a bill that was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].  The Offshore Energy and Jobs Act would revise existing law governing the leasing, operation, and development of oil and natural gas resources available in the [[Outer Continental Shelf]] (OCS).&lt;ref name="cbo2231" /&gt;  The bill is primarily supported by [[Republican party (United States)|Republicans]] and is opposed by President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name="pete1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obama1" /&gt;

==Provisions/Elements of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=2231sum&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 2231 – Summary |url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2231 |publisher=United States Congress |accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Offshore Energy and Jobs Act''' would amend the [[Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act]] (OCSLA) to direct the [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] to implement a leasing program that includes at least 50% of the available unleased acreage within each [[Outer Continental Shelf]] (OCS) planning area considered to have the largest undiscovered, technically recoverable [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] resources, with an emphasis on offering the most geologically prospective parts of the planning area.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;

The act instructs the Secretary, in developing a five-year oil and gas leasing program, to determine a specified domestic strategic production goal for the development of oil and natural gas as a result of that program.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;

It would also require the Secretary to: (1) develop and submit a new five-year oil and gas leasing program, (2) conduct offshore oil and gas Lease Sale 220 within one year after enactment of this Act, (3) make replacement lease blocks available in the [[Offshore drilling on the US Atlantic coast#Future lease sales|Virginia lease sale planning area]] that are acceptable for oil and gas exploration and production if the [[Secretary of Defense]] proposes deferral from a lease offering due to [[United States offshore drilling debate#Military training argument|defense-related activities]] irreconcilable with mineral exploration and development.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;

The bill instructs the Secretary to conduct a lease sale within two years after enactment of the Act for areas off the coast of [[South Carolina]] that have the most geologically promising hydrocarbon resources and constituting at least 25% of the leasable area within the South Carolina offshore administrative boundaries.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;

It also directs the Secretary to: (1) offer for sale by December 31, 2014, leases of tracts in the [[Santa Maria, California|Santa Maria]] and [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]/Ventura Basins of the Southern California OCS Planning Area; and (2) prepare a multisale [[environmental impact statement]] pursuant to the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] of 1969 for all lease sales required under this Act.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;

The Offshore Energy and Jobs Act, if passed, would also:
:*Allocate 37.5% of the amount of new federal leasing revenues to coastal states that are: (1) impacted by the leases under which those revenues are received by the United States, and (2) within 200 miles of the leased tract.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;
:*Establish in the [[Department of the Interior]]: (1) an Under Secretary for Energy, Lands, and Minerals, (2) an Assistant Secretary of Ocean Energy and Safety, (3) an Assistant Secretary of Land and Minerals Management, (4) a Bureau of Ocean Energy, (5) an Ocean Energy Safety Service, and (6) an Office of Natural Resources Revenue.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;
:*Instruct the Secretary to establish: (1) a National Offshore Energy Safety Academy, and (2) an Outer Continental Shelf Energy Safety Advisory Board.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;
:*Require the Secretary to: (1) certify annually that all Interior Department personnel having regular, direct official contact with government contractors, or conducting investigations, issuing permits, or overseeing energy programs, comply fully with federal employee ethics laws and regulations; and (3) conduct a random [[drug test]]ing program of such personnel.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;
:*Abolish the [[Minerals Management Service]].&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;
:*Direct the Secretary to collect non-refundable fees from the operators of facilities subject to inspection.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;
:*Establish in the Treasury the Ocean Energy Enforcement Fund as depository for such fees.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;
:*Redefine the outer Continental Shelf to include all submerged lands lying within the U.S. [[exclusive economic zone]] and the Continental Shelf adjacent to any [[United States territory|U.S. territory]].&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;

==Congressional Budget office report==
{{cbo summary}}&lt;ref name=cbo2231&gt;{{cite web |title=CBO {{!}} HR 2213|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44355|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

H.R. 2231 would revise existing laws and policies regarding the development of oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). It would direct the Department of the Interior (DOI) to adopt a new leasing plan for the 2015–2020 period, require auctions of leases in certain areas in the Atlantic and Pacific OCS, and reduce the department’s discretion regarding which regions would be included in future lease sales. Under this bill, some of the offsetting receipts from leases issued in newly available areas would be spent, without further appropriation, to make payments to states. Finally, H.R. 2231 would direct DOI to collect fees from certain firms that operate in the OCS and to implement various administrative reforms.&lt;ref name="cbo2231" /&gt;

CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 2231 would reduce net direct spending by $1.5 billion over the 2014–2023 period. Pay-as-you-go procedures apply because enacting the legislation would reduce direct spending. In addition, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost $40 million over the 2013–2018 period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. Enacting this bill would not affect revenues.&lt;ref name="cbo2231" /&gt;

==Procedural history==
===House===
The Offshore Energy and Jobs Act was introduced into the House on June 4, 2013 by [[Doc Hastings|Rep. Doc Hastings (R-WA)]].&lt;ref name=2231majoractions&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 2231 – Major Actions |url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2231/actions |publisher=United States Congress |accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bill was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources]] and the [[United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources]] on June 4, 2013.&lt;ref name=loc2231allcongactions&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 2231 – All Congressional Actions |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:H.R.2231:@@@X |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The subcommittee held hearings on June 6 and 11, before discharging the bill back to the full committee on June 12, 2013.&lt;ref name="loc2231allcongactions" /&gt;  On June 12, the House Committee on Natural Resources marked-up the bill and ordered it reported in amended form by a vote of 23-18.&lt;ref name="loc2231allcongactions" /&gt;  On June 24, 2013, the bill was reported alongside [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-113hrpt125/pdf/CRPT-113hrpt125.pdf House Report 113-125].&lt;ref name=hreport113125&gt;{{cite web |title=House Report 113-125 |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-113hrpt125/pdf/CRPT-113hrpt125.pdf |publisher=Government Printing Office |accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 28, 2013, the House voted 235-186 in [http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll304.xml Roll Call Vote 304] to pass the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act.&lt;ref name="loc2231allcongactions" /&gt;  Sixteen [[Democratic party (United States)|Democrats]] voted in favor of the bill.&lt;ref name=pete1&gt;{{cite news |last=Kasperowicz |first=Pete |title=House votes to expand offshore oil-and-gas leases |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/308433-house-votes-to-expand-offshore-oil-and-gas-leases |accessdate=July 2, 2013 |newspaper=The Hill |date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential reaction===
In a statement released on June 25, 2013, [[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]] issued a statement threatening to veto the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act if changes weren't made.&lt;ref name=obama1&gt;{{cite web |title=STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY H.R. 2231 – Offshore Energy and Jobs Act |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/113/saphr2231r_20130625.pdf |publisher=Executive Office of the President |accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his statement, the President criticized the bill for setting "unworkable deadlines," for reducing the net return to taxpayers of money from the leasing of public land, and for the details of the reorganization of the former Minerals Management Service.&lt;ref name="obama1" /&gt;  Three days later, the House passed the bill over the President's objections.&lt;ref name="loc2231allcongactions" /&gt;

==Debate and discussion==

The House [[Republican party (United States)|Republicans]] have three main talking points about their reasons for supporting the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act.&lt;ref name=2231gop&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 2231 – Legislative Digest |url=https://www.gop.gov/bill/113/1/hr2231 |publisher=House Republicans |accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Those three talking points are:
:*"The President has implemented a virtual moratorium on oil and natural gas exploration and production in the OCS.  His current 5-year leasing program blocks 85% of offshore areas from potential energy production."&lt;ref name="2231gop" /&gt;
:*"By blocking OCS exploration and production, the President is also blocking the vast economic benefits it would provide."&lt;ref name="2231gop" /&gt;
:*"In the long-run, offshore drilling has the potential to create 1.2 million jobs, $70 billion in wages, $2.2 trillion in tax receipts, and $8 trillion in additional economic output (GDP)."&lt;ref name="2231gop" /&gt;

Democrats responded to these arguments by insisting that there were enough open areas for energy companies to lease from and denied that the President's plan had increased gas prices.&lt;ref name="pete1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2596">The '''polar easterlies''' (also '''Polar Hadley cells''') are the dry, cold [[prevailing winds]] that blow from the high-pressure  areas of the [[polar high]]s at the [[North Pole|North]] and [[South Pole]]s towards low-pressure areas within the [[Westerlies]] at high latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Meteorology (2009).They are called Easterlies because the blow from the east [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?.p=1&amp;query=polar+easterlies&amp;submit=Search Polar easterlies.] [[American Meteorological Society]]. Retrieved on 2009-04-15.{{Dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cold]] air [[subsidence (atmosphere)|subsides]] at the poles creating the high pressure, forcing an [[equator]]ward outflow of air; that outflow is then deflected westward by the [[Coriolis effect]]. Unlike the [[westerlies]] in the [[middle latitudes]], the polar easterlies are often weak and irregular. These prevailing winds blow from the polar easterlies are one of the five primary wind zones, known as wind belts, that make up our atmosphere's circulatory system. This particular belt of wind begins at approximately 60 degrees north and south latitude and reaches to the poles. When air moves near the poles, cold temperatures shrink the air. This promotes air from warmer latitudes to flow into the area, causing a polar high-pressure zone. Air from this high-pressure zone then rushes toward the low-pressure zone surrounding the sub-polar region. The flow of air is altered by the Earth's rotation and deflected west, hence the name, between high- and low-pressure zones. Temperature and air pressure differentials and the earth's rotation combine to form global currents.

Another example of the phenomenon would be the trade winds, which reach from where the doldrums (areas that receive the largest levels of thermal radiation from the sun) leave off at about 5 degrees north and south latitude to as far as 30 degrees north and south. They are caused by air moving into the area from the subtropics to fill the void left by the doldrums' rising air. The trade winds blow steadily westward out of the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and out of the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere. Sailors in earlier times, traveling by wind current and sail only, counted upon the reliability of the trade winds to help them along on their voyages. Similarly, they sought to avoid the doldrums, where the wind was so scant they risked coming to a complete stop.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly used as a reliability indicator by electric power utilities.  SAIDI is the average outage duration for each customer served, and is calculated as:

&lt;math&gt;
\mbox{SAIDI} = \frac{\sum{U_i N_i}}{N_T}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number of customers and &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; is the annual outage time for location &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;N_T&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of customers served. In other words,

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{SAIDI} = \frac{\mbox{sum of all customer interruption durations}}{\mbox{total number of customers served}}&lt;/math&gt;

SAIDI is measured in units of time, often minutes or hours. It is usually measured over the course of a year, and according to IEEE Standard 1366-1998 the median value for North American utilities is approximately 1.50 hours.

'''Santa Lucia Cloud Forest''' ({{lang-es|Bosque Nublado Santa Lucía}}) is a cloud forest reserve, located about 80&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Quito]], in the province of [[Pichincha Province|Pichincha]], in [[Ecuador]]. This is at the far south of the southern phase of the Choco-Andean Rainforest Corridor. Rainforest Concern works with the Santa Lucia co-operative, a [[community-based conservation]] organisation dedicated to conservation and to sustainable development so that they can make a modest living whilst conserving their remaining cloud forest.

The community owns over {{convert|5|km2|acre|abbr=on}} of montane [[cloud forest]], of which about 80% is still in its prime, virgin state and the area has now been declared part of a Bosque Protector (Protected Forest). The community-based organisation formed by local campesino families manage their own resources and they have three basic aims:

* to conserve and protect the cloud forest belonging to member families.
* to develop sustainable sources of income for the members of Santa Lucía.
* to benefit directly or indirectly the residents in neighboring areas.

'''Santé engagé''' (in [[Mauritian creole]]: sante angaze) is a genre of [[music of Mauritius|Mauritian music]] which consists of singing protest songs. It is a way to protest against political/social oppression and repression through music. The genre mixes traditional Mauritian [[sega music|sega]] with Indian and Western influences.

==History==

===Context===
The 1960s and 1970s (“''les années de braise''”) have been a very bustling period in the [[history of Mauritius]]. It has been a period of high interracial tension leading to more than 300 deaths due to interracial affrays.&lt;ref name="Mauritian Militant Movement"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lemmm.org/history.asp| title=www.lemmm.org/index.asp| author=[[Mauritian Militant Movement]]| format=| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121090223/http://www.lemmm.org/history.asp| archivedate=2008-01-21| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been an indecisive period with regard to the cultural heirloom of the island with a deep reconsidering of the multicultural image.

====Independence of Mauritius====
[[Mauritius]] attained independence from [[Great Britain]] in 1968 without real exhilaration.&lt;ref name="Mauritius.org"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mauritius.org.uk/History.htm| title=www.mauritius.org/| author=Mauritius.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A profound division prevailed between, on one side, the members of the independent movement and, on the other side, the anti-independentists.  The island is faced with a vertiginously high level of unemployment and people still had in mind the recent interracial tensions peaking in 1964 and 1968.

Under the pretext of security and law and order, the newly formed government of Mauritius took highly repressive measures against opponents who intended to put forward ideas adverse to those of the governing regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://countrystudies.us/mauritius/1.htm| title=www.countrystudies.us/| author=countrystudies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though independence was declared in 1968, British colonial presence and dominance remained clearly visible throughout the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a779272974~db=all~order=page| title=The Political Consecration of Community in Mauritius, 1948-68| author=Deborah Sutton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Raise in consciousness====
Faced with such restrictions, youngsters (mostly university students) started to set up groups to debate on all ideological topics including politics and culture.&lt;ref name="5Plus Dimanche"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.5plusltd.com/archive/2003/septembre/28_09_2003/chanson.htm| title=5plusltd.com&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp5plusltd Resources and Information.| author=5Plus Dimanche| access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several students, among others [[Dev Virahsawmy]], Jooneed Jeeroburkhan, Tirat Ramkisoon, Krishen Matis, Ah-Ken Wong, Kreeti Goburdhun, Vella Vengaroo created the Club of Students (''Club des Etudiants'').&lt;ref name="Mauritian Militant Movement"/&gt; With the participation of [[Paul Bérenger]], the Club of Students became the Club of Militant Students (''Clubs des Etudiants militants''). The Club later gave way to the creation of the [[Mauritian Militant Movement]] (in 1969) lauding national unity and social justice, inspired from the [[Libertarian Marxism]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://openlibrary.org/b/OL1848283M/Mouvement_militant_mauricien| title=Mouvement militant mauricien (1989 edition) &amp;#124; Open Library| author=Mallenn D. Oodiah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with this political movement, youngsters started militating for cultural freedom. The government redoubled its repressive actions against them, using the police force and ''tappeurs'' for assaults against the youngsters. Many members of the MMM are jailed as political prisoners.&lt;ref name="Mauritius.org"/&gt;

====Fight through culture and music====
The young generation however never abdicated. Freedom of culture was a fundamental element of their resistance, specially the fight for the recognition of the [[Mauritian creole]] as a full-fledged language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://lal.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/16/3/245| title=http://lal.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/16/3/245| author=The contribution of creative writing to the standardization of Mauritian Creole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s they started to create cultural groups (in [[Mauritian creole]]: Grup Kiltirel) to debate about culture.&lt;ref name="Libération Créole"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bibliotheque.refer.org/litoi/10-8.htm| title=http://www.bibliotheque.refer.org/litoi/10-8.htm| author=Libération Créole| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://archive.is/20011123130303/http://www.bibliotheque.refer.org/litoi/10-8.htm| archivedate=2001-11-23| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with this new form of resistance, young artists started to write songs reflecting their thoughts. The Groups travelled throughout the island to meet people and make their voice heard. They also sang those songs with committed [[lyrics]] which, in a certain way, clearly expressed the reality of the moment.&lt;ref name="Libération Créole"/&gt; The theme of these songs where various: politics, injustice, oppression, etc. The very first santé engazé is believed to be "''Montagne Bertlo''" written and composed by Jooneed Jeeroburkhan in 1969 in Mauritius, after completing his higher studies in Canada (on a Commonwealth Scholarship).

Resistance and denunciation through music quickly became popular. It helped to transmit ideas more easily. It is this style of music that is called ''santé engazé'' (committed song).

===Golden age===
It is commonly agreed that ''sante angaze'' really erupted with the Grup Kiltirel Soley Ruz (or Soley Ruz) formed in 1973.&lt;ref name="5-Plus Dimanche"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.5plusltd.com/archive/2003/avril/06_04_2003/annees.htm| title=http://www.5plusltd.com/archive/2003/avril/06_04_2003/annees.htm| author=5-Plus Dimanche}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cultural group, gathered many talented friends-artists, among others Bam Cuttayen, Micheline Virahsawmy, Rosemay Nelson, Nitish Joganah, Ram Joganah and Lélou Ménwar, Bruno Jacques, Paulo . They travelled throughout the island to sing their committed songs. Soley Ruz quickly became popular around the island.

In 1975, another grup kiltirel is formed (Grup Kiltirel Morisien) with, among others, Odile Chevreau, [[Siven Chinien]], Habib Moosaheb, Rama Poonoosamy as members. Subsequently other groups were formed: ''Fangurin, Kler de linn, Fler kanne, Flamboyant, Sitronel, Ebène, Grup kiltirel IDP''.&lt;ref name="5Plus Dimanche"/&gt;

After the dissolution of Soley Ruz in 1979, many of its members started solo careers. Ram and Nitish Joganah created in the same year a new group, the [[Grup Latanier]] which would become the new symbol of ''sante angaze''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://latanier.com/history.htm| title=http://latanier.com/index.htm| author=[[Grup Latanier]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Santé engazé stayed extremely popular among the population during the 1980s, specially within the working-class.

==Musical style==
''Sante angaze'' is a musical style which blends Sega music, Oriental music and Occidental music. It is a fusion of musical styles which were popular at the time of its creation, i.e., in the 1970s. In fact it perfectly reflected the frame of mind of those who were at the origins of this style, that is a mixture of the cultural diversity of the island, towards cultural unity.

Traditional instruments of the [[sega music]] (ravanne, maravane, [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]]) were thus mixed with oriental instruments ([[tabla]], [[Pump organ|harmonium]], [[sitar]]). Other instruments such as [[guitar]], [[violin]] and [[drum]]s completed that mixture.

Even though the sonority of such committed songs are close to the [[sega music]], the outcome is quite different insofar as the [[sega music]] has a more festive rhythm and lesser oriented on demonstrating and passing on a particular message.

The rhythm of ''sante angaze'' is generally slower than the sega and influenced by many other musical styles.

==Relation to politics==
Due to the context during which it has been created and its relationship with militancy, ''sante angaze'' (at least in its early years) is closely related to politics. The songs denounced political injustice and unfairness becoming intrinsically a form of militancy. The artists were themselves militants.
Santé engazé has played a great part during general elections acting as the voice of the militant movement. The most notable example in this respect is the songs written and sung by [[Siven Chinien]]. His album ''[[soldat lalit]]'' was played (and is still played) throughout the general elections campaign, with the title song – "Soldat Lalit" – becoming the anthem of the MMM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://fazeer.wordpress.com/2007/06/11/june-11th-1982/| title=http://fazeer.wordpress.com/2007/06/11/june-11th-1982/| author=Fazeer.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Groups and musicians==

===Soley Ruz===
Soley Ruz was created in 1973 at the initiative of various friends-artists, among others Bam Cuttayen, Micheline Virahsawmy, Rosemay Nelson, Nitish Joganah, Ram Joganah and Lélou Ménwar,Bruno Jacques,paulo, marino . They released three albums: ''Nuvo Kiltir'' in 1974, ''Buké Banané'' in 1976 and ''Later 7 Couler'' in 1978. The grup was dissolved in 1979 and most of its members started solo careers.&lt;ref name="5-Plus Dimanche"/&gt; Some continued in the field of santé engazé while others changed to adopt other musical styles.

===Bam Cuttayen===
Bam Cuttayen was a songwriter and singer who has deeply marked the socio-cultural history of Mauritius. He was born in 1951 in [[Quatre Bornes]] ([[Mauritius]]) and died in 2002. He dedicated his life to his fight against poverty and injustice. His songs reflect his battle. Bam Cuttayen released his first album ''Fler raket'' in 1980. Three other albums followed: Pei larm kuler in 1981, ''Zenfan later'' in 1986 and ''Brin soley'' in 1993. In 2003, a posthumous album (''Parol envolé'') of his songs has been edited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.temoignages.re/l-humble-voix-du-rassembleur,11310.html| title=http://www.temoignages.re/l-humble-voix-du-rassembleur,11310.html| author=Temoignages.re}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siven Chinien===
Siven Chinien was a songwriter, singer and a militant activist. Even though he has composed songs on extremely various themes, his work is mostly remembered for his commitment to the [[Mauritian Militant Movement]] and his numerous militant songs in favour of the working-class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.5plusltd.com/archive/2003/mars/02_03_2003/annees.htm| title=http://www.5plusltd.com/archive/2003/mars/02_03_2003/annees.htm| author=5-Plus Dimanche}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grup Latanier===
{{Main|Grup Latanier}}
Grup Latanier was created by Ram and Nitish Joganah after they parted from Soley Ruz. The group has since remained very active and released numerous albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://gruplatanier.com/History.html| title=http://gruplatanier.com/History.html| author=Gruplatanier.com/History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zul Ramiah===
Zul Ramiah is a songwriter and singer. He began his musical career within the ''Grup kiltirel IDP'' before contributing to the albums of [[Siven Chinien]] (Soldat lalit) and [[Bam Cuttayen]]. Zul Ramiah also participated to Grup Latanier's first album ''krapo kriyé''. He then went on to start a solo career.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lemauricien.org/wes/041210/al.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grup Zenfan Dodo===
Grup Zenfan Dodo is a group from [[Mahebourg]]. Led by singers Ruben Gopal and Kishan Pem, they have released several albums since the mid 90s.

==Influence on today's Mauritian music==
''Sante angaze'' has radically transformed the musical landscape of Mauritius.

===Evolution of Santé engazé===
Even though many people today consider ''sante angaze'' as a revolved musical style, the latter still exists and much appreciated. ''Santé engazé'' has simply evolved. The militantly oriented protests of its origins have gradually evolved and broaden to other subjects, not specially related to politics.&lt;ref name="Kotzot.com"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.kotzot.com/news/chanson-engagee-des-restes-sans-politique.html| title=http://www.kotzot.com/news/chanson-engagee-des-restes-sans-politique.html| author=Kotzot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core of its philosophy however remains the same: raise people's consciousness through music. ''Sante angaze'' is today less related to the musical style than the lyrics of songs. In other words, what we call a ''sante angaze'' today is a song with a committed lyrics, passing a committed message, whatever the musical style. That's why today it is better to talk of ''lamizik angaze'' (committed music) rather than ''sante angaze''.

===The new generation===
The evolution and influence of ''sante angaze'' can clearly be noticed within the new generation of artists in Mauritius. The [[music of Mauritius]] has diversified through years but the impact of santé engazé is visible insofar as the new generation of artists, whatever their musical style ([[sega music]], [[seggae]], [[reggae]], [[ragga]], [[dancehall]], etc.), try to use music to transmit a specific message.&lt;ref name="Kotzot.com"/&gt; Their inspirations remain wide-ranging: poverty, injustice, social wrongdoings, war, cultural unity, etc. These artists are the sons and heirs of santé engazé. However, the vast majority of them deny to be politically oriented preferring to remain neutral and denouncing through music.&lt;ref name="Kotzot.com"/&gt;

'''Scribing''' was used to produce lines for cartographic map compilations before the use of computer based [[geographic information system]]s. Lines produced by manual scribing are sharp, clear and even. 

An impression of the corrected compilation sheet is photographed onto scribe sheet material or drawn using pencil. While working over a [[light table]], lines on the scribe sheet are traced with a metal or sapphire-tipped scribe tool to remove thin lines of translucent coating to produce a handmade [[Negative (photography)|negative]] image. This compares with [[Technical drawing|drafting]] where an ink image is made on tracing paper by depositing ink using a pen to produce a [[Positive (photography)|positive]] image. Scribing produces a result superior to drafting, but is more time consuming.

The scribe sheet is made of a stable plastic base material and coated with a material which is designed for easy removal using a scribing tool to produce a cleanly cut line. Various colours are used, and orange is said to produce the least eye-strain for the cartographer.

One scribe sheet is produced for each map colour. Corrections can be made by "duffing" (re-coating) the scribe sheet with special duffing liquid. The detail can then be re-scribed. Printing plates are produced from the finished scribe sheets, one for each colour of the map. 

==Scribe tools==

A tripod or trolley arrangement is used to hold the scribe [[stylus]]. A stylus of required thickness is set in the trolley and the surface material is removed by applying light pressure as the trolley is moved over the image. Care must be taken to ensure the base material is not gouged or distorted.

Either a round point or chisel point stylus may be used. Chisel points must be set at right angles to the direction of movement. As well as single line gravers, double and triple lines can be produced with double and triple graver stylus. Small circles can be produced using motorised versions of scribing tools, and symbols, figures etc., can be produced using plastic or metal templates.

==Area symbols==

‘Peelcoat’ is used to produce a negative of an area of detail such as a lake or forest. The border of the area is cut or scribed on the peelcoat and the coat of the sheet within the area is peeled off to produce a negative image.

A [[stipple]] pattern can be used to produce an area symbol over the peeled surface. A stipple sheet with a simple repeating symbol (such as that for swamp or sand) is combined with the area by photographing the stipple onto the peelcoat.

[[Image:The Secret Thoughts of Cats pic.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The book cover.]]
'''''The Secret Thoughts of Cats''''' was written and illustrated by [[Steven Appleby]], and first published in 1996. 

Also known as the '''''Infinite Subtlety of Cat Expressions''''', it focuses on the fact that [[cat]] expressions are always the same, no matter what the situation (apart from when [[asleep]] or [[dead]]). It has a picture of a cat with the same expression on every page, and a description of what it’s thinking or doing underneath. It finishes with ‘Afterthoughts’ of cats, a selection of observations made on cat behaviour. The first page is a picture of cat hairs, the last, cat hairs on cushions.&lt;br&gt;
It was written in memory of: Terry, Dibble, Sally, and for Jim.

'''Trench foot ''' is a medical condition caused by prolonged exposure of the feet to damp, unsanitary, and cold conditions. It is one of many [[immersion foot syndromes]]. The use of the word ''trench'' in the name of this condition is a reference to [[trench warfare]], mainly associated with [[World War I]].

==Signs and symptoms ==
Affected feet may become numb, by [[erythema]] (turning red) or [[cyanosis]] (turning blue) as a result of poor blood supply, and may begin emanating a decaying odor if the early stages of [[necrosis]] (tissue death) set in. As the condition worsens, feet may also begin to swell. Advanced trench foot often involves [[blister]]s and [[open sore]]s, which lead to [[fungus|fungal]] infections; this is sometimes called [[tropical ulcer]] (jungle rot). If left untreated, trench foot usually results in [[gangrene]], which may require [[amputation]]. If trench foot is treated properly, complete recovery is normal, though it is marked by severe short-term pain when feeling returns.&lt;ref name = Tactical&gt;

== Causes ==
Unlike [[frostbite]], trench foot does not require freezing temperatures; it can occur in temperatures up to 16° Celsius (about 60° Fahrenheit) and within as little as 13 hours. Exposure to these environmental conditions causes deterioration and destruction of the [[capillary|capillaries]] and leads to morbidity of the surrounding flesh.&lt;ref name = Mann&gt;{{Citation

== Prevention ==
Trench foot can be prevented by keeping the feet clean, warm, and dry. It was also discovered in World War I that a key preventive measure was regular foot inspections; soldiers would be paired and each made responsible for the feet of the other, and they would generally apply [[whale oil]] to prevent trench foot. If left to their own devices, soldiers might neglect to take off their own boots and socks to dry their feet each day, but if it were the responsibility of another, this became less likely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bullets, Boots and Bandages ''(episode 1/3)''|author=David, Saul (presenter)|publisher=BBC Four|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on in the war, instances of trench foot began to decrease, probably as a result of the introduction of the aforementioned measures; of wooden [[duckboards]] to cover the muddy, wet, cold ground of the trenches; and of the increased practice of troop rotation, which kept soldiers from prolonged time at the front.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Treatment==
The mainstay of treatment, like the treatment of [[gangrene]], is surgical [[debridement]], and often includes [[amputation]]. Self-treatment consists of changing socks two or three times a day and usage of plenty of talcum powder. Wherever possible, shoes and socks should be taken off, feet bathed for five minutes, patted dry, talcum powder applied and feet elevated to let air get to them.

== History ==
Trench foot was first documented by [[Napoleon]]'s army in 1812. It became prevalent during the [[French invasion of Russia|retreat from Russia]] and was first described by French army surgeon [[Dominique Jean Larrey]].&lt;ref name="pmid15617178"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Régnier C |title=Etiological argument about the Trench Foot |language=French |journal=Hist Sci Med |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=315–32 |year=2004 |pmid=15617178 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a problem for soldiers engaged in [[trench warfare]] during the winters of [[World War I]] (hence the name).&lt;ref name="pmid17219792"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Atenstaedt RL |title=Trench foot: the medical response in the first World War 1914-18 |journal=Wilderness Environ Med |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=282–9 |year=2006 |pmid=17219792 |doi=10.1580/06-WEME-LH-027R.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trench foot made a reappearance in the British Army during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/recent/falklands/falklands_gallery_06.shtml |title= Falklands Conflict Gallery By Major General Julian Thompson |publisher=BBC |date=2014-09-18 |accessdate=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people were even reported to have developed trench foot at the 1998 and 2007 [[Glastonbury Festival]]s, the 2009 and 2013 [[Leeds Festival]]s, as well as the 2012 [[Download Festival]], as a result of the sustained cold, wet, and muddy conditions at the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7450410.stm | work=BBC News | title=I got trench foot at Glastonbury | date=June 23, 2008 | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

Originally emerging in 1977 from the [[anti-nuclear movement]], today the institute employs around 150 staff members in offices in Freiburg, [[Darmstadt]] and [[Berlin]]. It produces scientific studies and advises policymakers, environmental NGOs, institutions and companies. Some 100 projects, both national and international, are completed each year.

The institute’s thematic priorities are:

*Chemicals management and [[technology assessment]]
*[[Energy]] and [[climate]]
*[[Air pollution|Emission]] and ambient pollution control, [[radiation protection]]
*[[Agriculture]] and [[biodiversity]]
*[[Sustainable consumption]]
*[[Nuclear engineering]] and facility safety
*[[Law]], [[policy]] and [[governance]]

The institute is constituted as a registered association with around 3,000 members, of which almost 40 are local authorities. It finances its work primarily by acquiring third-party funding for its projects. This is complemented by membership fees and donations. Annual revenue is €8.5&amp;nbsp;million. The Öko-Institut has published an e-paper named eco@work since summer 2006.

The institute is a founding member of the EnergieVision association, which awards the ok-power label for [[green electricity]] products. It also launched the EcoTopTen consumer information campaign — the EcoTopTen web portal provides product recommendations for sustainable consumption.

'''ʻOumuamua''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Haw-oumuamua.oga|ʔ|oʊ|ˌ|m|uː|ə|ˈ|m|uː|ə}}) is the first [[interstellar object]] detected passing through the [[Solar System]]. [[Naming of comets#Current system|Formally designated]] '''1I/2017 U1''', it was discovered by [[Robert Weryk]] using the [[Pan-STARRS]] telescope at [[Haleakala Observatory]], Hawaii, on 19 October 2017, 40 days after it passed its closest point to the Sun. When first seen, it was about {{cvt|{{#expr: 85*384400 round -6}}|km|mi AU|lk=on}} from Earth (about 85 times as far away as the Moon), and already heading away from the Sun.

ʻOumuamua is a small object, estimated to be about {{convert|100|-|1000|x|35|-|167|x|35|-|167|m|ft|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="NASA20181114" /&gt; in size. It has a dark red color, similar to objects in the [[outer Solar System]]. ʻOumuamua showed no signs of a [[comet tail]] despite its close approach to the Sun, but has since undergone non-gravitational acceleration, potentially consistent with a push from solar radiation pressure.&lt;ref name="UT-230181031" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ARX-20181101" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SA-201809287" /&gt; It has significant elongation and rotation rate, so it is thought to be metal-rich with a relatively high density. ʻOumuamua is [[tumbling (rigid body)|tumbling]], rather than smoothly rotating, and is moving so fast relative to the Sun that there is no chance it originated in the Solar System. It also means that ʻOumuamua cannot be captured into a solar orbit, so it will eventually leave the Solar System and resume traveling through [[interstellar space]]. ʻOumuamua's [[Planetary system|system of origin]] and the amount of time it has spent traveling amongst the stars are unknown.

== Nomenclature ==
[[File:Oumuamua orbit at perihelion.png|thumb|left|[[Hyperbolic trajectory]] of ʻOumuamua through the [[inner Solar System]] with the Sun at the [[focus (geometry)|focus]] ([https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/archive/PIA22357_JPL-20180620-ASTRDSf-0007-Interstellar%20Asteroid%20animation-720p.mp4 animation])&lt;/center&gt;]]
As the first known object of its type, ʻOumuamua presented a unique case for the [[International Astronomical Union]], which assigns designations for astronomical objects. Originally classified as comet '''C/2017 U1''', it was later reclassified as asteroid '''A/2017 U1''', due to the absence of a [[Coma (cometary)|coma]]. Once it was unambiguously identified as coming from outside the Solar System, a [[Naming of comets#Current system|new designation]] was created: '''I''', for Interstellar object. ʻOumuamua, as the first object so identified, was designated 1I, with rules on the eligibility of objects for I-numbers, and the names to be assigned to these interstellar objects, yet to be codified. The object may be referred to as 1I; 1I/2017 U1; 1I/ʻOumuamua; or 1I/2017 U1 (ʻOumuamua).&lt;ref name="MPEC2017-V17"/&gt;

It roughly translates to "first distant messenger".&lt;ref name="MPEC2017-V17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Outerplaces"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.outerplaces.com/science/item/17035-interstellar-object-asteroid-oumuamua |title=Our Solar System's First Interstellar Asteroid is Named ʻOumuamua' |last=Kesh |first=Johnathan |date=8 November 2017 |website=Outer Places |access-date=23 November 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first character is a Hawaiian [[ʻOkina|ʻokina]], not an [[apostrophe]], and is represented by a [[single quotation mark]] and pronounced as a [[glottal stop]]; the name was chosen by the Pan-STARRS team&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Wall |first=Mike |date=16 November 2017 |title=Meet ʻOumuamua, the First-Ever Asteroid from Another Star |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/meet-oumuamua-the-first-ever-asteroid-from-another-star |magazine=Scientific American |language=en |via=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in consultation with Kaʻiu Kimura and [[Larry Kimura]] of the [[University of Hawaii at Hilo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.hawaii.edu/news/2017/11/20/an-interstellar-visitor-unmasked |title=An interstellar visitor unmasked |last=Gal |first=Roy |date=20 November 2017 |work=University of Hawaiʻi System News |access-date=22 November 2017 |language=en-US |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the official name was decided upon, the name ''Rama'' was suggested, the name given to an alien spacecraft discovered under similar circumstances in the 1973 science fiction novel ''[[Rendezvous with Rama]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=The first visitor from another solar system has just been spotted: Rendezvous with Rama? |magazine=The Economist |date=2 November 2017 |url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21730863-rendezvous-rama-first-visitor-another-solar-system-has-just-been}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ʻOumuamua is small and dark. It was not seen in [[STEREO|STEREO HI-1A]] observations near its perihelion on 9 September 2017, limiting its brightness to ~13.5 mag.&lt;ref name="Bannister2017" /&gt; By the end of October, ʻOumuamua had already faded to [[apparent magnitude]] ~23,&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; and by mid-December 2017, it was expected to be too faint and fast moving to be studied by even the largest ground-based telescopes.&lt;ref name="Gemini"/&gt;

ʻOumuamua was compared to the fictional alien spacecraft ''Rama'' because of its interstellar origin. Adding to the coincidence, both the real and the fictional objects are unusually elongated and limited in size.&lt;ref name="Koren-20171211"/&gt; However, ʻOumuamua has a reddish hue and unsteady brightness, which are typical of asteroids.&lt;ref name=wenz2017&gt;{{cite magazine |first=John |last=Wenz |magazine=Astronomy |url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2017/11/interstellar-asteroid-is-a-quarter-mile-long-red-beast |title=The first discovered interstellar asteroid is a quarter-mile long red beast |date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20171122"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=An Interstellar Visitor Both Familiar and Alien |date=22 November 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/science/oumuamua-space-asteroid.html |accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Seth |last=Shostak |title=Is this mysterious space rock actually an alien spaceship? |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/mysterious-space-rock-actually-alien-spaceship-ncna829501 |work=[[NBC News]] |date=14 December 2017 |accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ʻOumuamua entered the Solar System from north of the plane of the [[ecliptic]]. The pull of the Sun's gravity caused it to speed up until it reached its maximum speed of {{cvt|87.71|km/s|kph}} as it passed south of the ecliptic on 6 September and made a sharp turn upward at its closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) on 9 September at a distance of {{cvt|0.255|AU|km mi|lk=on}} from the Sun, i.e., about 17% closer than [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s closest approach to the Sun.&lt;ref name="NASA-FAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pseudoMPEC" /&gt;{{refn |group="Note" |Comet [[C/2012 S1 (ISON)]] peaked at {{cvt|377|km/s|kph}} at perihelion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isoncampaign.org/karl/ison-is-just-fine |first=Karl |last=Battams |website=NASA Comet ISON Observing Campaign |title=Comet ISON is doing just fine! |date=9 October 2013 |access-date=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it passed 0.0124 AU from the Sun (20 times closer than ʻOumuamua).}} The object is now heading away from the Sun towards [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]] at an angle of 66° from the direction of its approach.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;According to the formula: [[Hyperbolic trajectory#Eccentricity and angle between approach and departure|{{big|1=&lt;math&gt;2\,\theta{_\infty}=2\cos^{-1}(-1/e)&lt;/math&gt;}}]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the outward leg of its journey through the Solar System, ʻOumuamua passed within the orbit of Earth on 14 October at a distance of approximately {{cvt|0.1616|AU|km mi|lk=on}} from Earth, and went back north of the ecliptic on 16 October and passed beyond the orbit of Mars on 1 November.&lt;ref name="NASA-FAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="skyandtelescope"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; It passed beyond Jupiter's orbit in May 2018, and will pass beyond Saturn's orbit in January 2019 and Neptune's orbit in 2022.&lt;ref name="NASA-FAQ"/&gt; As it leaves the Solar System it will be approximately [[right ascension]] 23h51m and [[declination]] +24°45', in [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]].&lt;ref name="pseudoMPEC" /&gt; It will continue to slow down until it reaches a speed of 26.33&amp;nbsp;km/s relative to the Sun, the same speed it had before its approach to the Solar System.&lt;ref name="pseudoMPEC" /&gt; It will take the object roughly 20,000 years to leave the Solar System completely.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Given that the [[Oort cloud]] is the furthest reaches of the Solar System, define the [[Solar system#Boundaries|edge of the Solar System]] at {{convert|2|ly|AU e12km |abbr=off|lk=on|sigfig=2|sp=us}} and assume an average velocity of 26.3 km/s.

On 27 June 2018, astronomers reported a non-gravitational acceleration to ʻOumuamua's trajectory, potentially consistent with a push from solar radiation pressure.&lt;ref name="UT-230181031" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ARX-20181101" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20180627nasa"/&gt; Initial speculation as to the cause of this acceleration pointed to comet off-gassing,&lt;ref name="Nature 27-6-2018" /&gt; whereby portions of the object are ejected as the sun heats the surface. However, multiple objections have been raised to this possibility. Researchers point out that no such tail of gasses was ever observed following the object. Additionally, the anomalous acceleration was not observed when ʻOumuamua was passing at its closest to the sun as would be expected. A follow up analysis of these claims identifies that, were ʻOumuamua a comet, the off-gassing should have caused such an increase in rotational torque as to tear the object apart.&lt;ref name="ARX-20180920" /&gt;

==== Indications of origin ====
Accounting for Vega's [[proper motion]], it would have taken ʻOumuamua 600,000 years to reach the Solar System from Vega.&lt;ref name="NAT-20171120" /&gt; But as a nearby star, Vega was not in the same part of the sky at that time.&lt;ref name="skyandtelescope" /&gt; Astronomers calculate that one hundred years ago the asteroid was {{convert|561|±|0.6|AU|e9km e9mi |round=each |abbr=unit}} from the Sun and traveling at 26.33&amp;nbsp;km/s with respect to the Sun.&lt;ref name="pseudoMPEC" /&gt; This interstellar speed is very close to the mean motion of material in the Milky Way in the neighborhood of the Sun, also known as the [[local standard of rest]] (LSR), and especially close to the mean motion of a relatively close group of [[red dwarf]] stars. This velocity profile also indicates an [[extrasolar]] origin, but appears to rule out the [[List of nearest stars and brown dwarfs|closest dozen stars]].&lt;ref name="Mamajek2017" /&gt; In fact, the strong correlation between ʻOumuamua's velocity and the local standard of rest might mean that it has circulated the Milky Way several times and thus may have originated from an entirely different part of the galaxy.&lt;ref name="NAT-20171120" /&gt;

It is unknown how long the object has been traveling among the stars.&lt;ref name="NASA-FAQ"/&gt; The Solar System is likely the first star system that ʻOumuamua has closely encountered since being ejected from its birth star system, potentially several billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Ye2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NAT-20171120" /&gt; It has been speculated that the object may have been ejected from a stellar system in one of the local [[Stellar kinematic group|kinematic associations]] of [[young star]]s (specifically, [[Carina OB1|Carina]] or Columba) within a range of about 100 parsecs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2013 |title=Unveiling new members in ﬁve nearby young moving groups |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=435 |issue=2 |pages=1376–1388 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stt1381 |arxiv=1309.1669 |last1=Moór |first1=A. |last2=Szabó |first2=Gy.

However, its actual distance is not known precisely: According to [[Gaia Data Release 1]], the distance to TYC4742-1027-1 is {{convert|137|±|13|pc|abbr=off|lk=on}}. It is not known if an encounter actually occurred. Update: This star has new measurements in [[Gaia Data Release 2]], and an origins study based on this by Bailer-Jones et al. (2018) shows that TYC4742-1027-1 did not come within 2pc of ʻOumuamua.&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent study (August 2018) using [[Gaia Data Release 2]] has updated the possible past close encounters and has identified four stars that ʻOumuamua passed relatively close to and at moderately low velocities in the past few million years. &lt;ref name="Bailer-Jones2018"&gt; {{cite journal |last1=Bailer-Jones |first=Coryn A.L. |display-authors=etal |title=Plausible home stars of the interstellar object ʻOumuamua found in Gaia DR2 |journal=Astronomical Journal |date=2018-10-18 |volume=156 |issue=5 |page=205 |ref=Bailer-Jones2018|doi=10.3847/1538-3881/aae3eb |arxiv=1809.09009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one hypothesis, ʻOumuamua could be a fragment from a [[Disrupted planet|tidally disrupted planet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ćuk |first=Matija |arxiv=1712.01823 |title=1I/ʻOumuamua as a Tidal Disruption Fragment From a Binary Star System |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=852 |issue=1 |pages=L15 |date=19 December 2017 |doi=10.3847/2041-8213/aaa3db |bibcode=2018ApJ...852L..15C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;See also {{cite arxiv |eprint=1801.02658v2|last1=Ravikov|first1=Roman R. |title=1I/2017 ʻOumuamua-like Interstellar Asteroids as Possible Messengers from the Dead Stars |class=astro-ph.EP |year=2018}}, ʻOumuamua is a fragment of a white-dwarf-star tidal-disruption-event. This easily explains its 6:1 or 10:1 elongation and its "refractory" composition; containing probably nickel-iron, possibly other metals, too.&lt;/ref&gt; If true, this would make ʻOumuamua a rare object, of a type much less abundant than most extrasolar "dusty-snowball" comets or asteroids.

=== Classification ===
&lt;!-- This section seems to just repeat information contained in other sections. --&gt;
Initially, ʻOumuamua was announced as comet C/2017 U1 (PANSTARRS) based on a strongly hyperbolic trajectory.&lt;ref name="Discovery" /&gt; In an attempt to confirm any cometary activity, very deep [[Shift-and-add|stacked images]] were taken at the [[Very Large Telescope]] later the same day, but the object showed no presence of a [[Coma (cometary)|coma]].&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;According to [[Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams]]'s CBET 4450, none of the observers had detected any sign of cometary activity. The initial classification as a comet was based on the object's orbit.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the object was renamed A/2017 U1, becoming the first comet ever to be [[Naming of comets#Current system|re-designated as an asteroid]].&lt;ref name="A2017U1" /&gt; Once it was identified as an interstellar object, it was designated 1I/2017 U1, the first member of a new class of objects.&lt;ref name="MPEC2017-V17" /&gt; The lack of a coma limits the amount of surface ice to a few square meters, and any [[volatiles]] (if they exist) must lie below a crust at least {{cvt|0.5|m|ft}} thick.&lt;ref name="Jewitt2017" /&gt; It also indicates that the object must have formed within the [[Frost line (astrophysics)|frost line]] of its parent stellar system or have been in the inner region of that stellar system long enough for all near-surface ice to [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimate]], as may be the case with [[damocloid]]s.{{Citation needed|reason=Not mentioned in previous cited source|date=January 2018}} It is difficult to say which scenario is more likely due to the chaotic nature of small body dynamics,{{Citation needed|reason=Not mentioned in previous cited source|date=January 2018}} although if it formed in a similar manner to Solar System objects, its spectrum indicates that the latter scenario is true. Any [[meteor|meteoric activity]] from ʻOumuamua would have been expected to occur on 18 October 2017 coming from the constellation [[Sextans]], but no activity was detected by the Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar.&lt;ref name="Ye2017" /&gt;

On 27 June 2018, astronomers reported that ʻOumuamua was thought to be a mildly active [[comet]], and not an [[asteroid]], as previously thought. This was determined by measuring a non-gravitational boost to ʻOumuamua's acceleration, consistent with comet outgassing.&lt;ref name="Nature 27-6-2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NAT-20180627"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20180627nasa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eso1820June2018Oumuamua"/&gt; However, studies submitted in October 2018 suggest that the object is neither an asteroid nor a comet.&lt;ref name="ARX-20180920"&gt;{{cite arxiv |last=Rafikov |first=Roman R. |title=Spin Evolution and Cometary Interpretation of the Interstellar Minor Object 1I/2017 ʻOumuamua |date=20 September 2018 |eprint=1809.06389v2 |class=astro-ph.EP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="QM-20181010"&gt;{{cite web |last=Skibba |first=Ramin |title=Interstellar Visitor Found to Be Unlike a Comet or an Asteroid |url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/interstellar-comet-oumuamua-might-not-actually-be-a-comet-20181010/ |date=10 October 2018 |work=[[Quanta Magazine]] |accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appearance, shape, and composition ===
Spectra recorded by the {{cvt|4.2|m}} [[William Herschel Telescope]] on 25 October showed that the object was featureless, and [[Trans-Neptunian object#Colors|colored red]] like [[Kuiper belt]] objects.&lt;ref name="WHT" /&gt; Spectra from the Hale Telescope showed a less-red color resembling comet nuclei or [[Trojan (astronomy)|Trojans]].&lt;ref name="Ye2017" /&gt; Its spectrum is similar to that of [[D-type asteroid]]s.&lt;ref name="Jewitt2017" /&gt;

In December 2017, astronomer [[Avi Loeb]] of [[Harvard University]], an adviser to the [[Breakthrough Listen]] Project, cited ʻOumuamua's unusually elongated shape as one of the reasons why the [[Green Bank Telescope]] in [[West Virginia]] would listen for [[radio emission]]s from it to see if there were any unexpected signs that it might be of [[Extraterrestrial intelligence|artificial origin]],&lt;ref name=Guarddian2017-12-11 /&gt; although earlier limited observations by other radio telescopes such as the [[SETI Institute]]'s [[Allen Telescope Array]] had produced no such results.&lt;ref name=SETI /&gt; On 13 December 2017, the Green Bank Telescope observed the asteroid for six hours across four bands of radio frequency. No radio signals from ʻOumuamua were detected in this very limited scanning range, but observations are ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Breakthrough Listen Releases Initial Results and Data from Observations of ‘Oumuamua&lt;!--Deny Citation Bot--&gt; |url=http://breakthroughinitiatives.org/news/15 |publisher=Breakthrough Listen |date=13 December 2017 |accessdate=15 December 2017 |quote=No evidence of artificial signals emanating from the object so far detected by the Green Bank Telescope, but monitoring and analysis continue.

On October 26, 2018, [[Avi Loeb]] and his postdoc Shmuel Bialy submitted a paper exploring the possibility of ʻOumuamua being an artificial thin [[solar sail]] accelerated by solar radiation pressure in an effort to help explain the object's non-gravitational acceleration.&lt;ref name="UT-230181031"&gt;{{cite web |last=Williams |first=Matt |title=Could Oumuamua Be an Extra-Terrestrial Solar Sail? |url=https://www.universetoday.com/140391/could-oumuamua-be-an-extra-terrestrial-solar-sail/ |date=2 November 2018 |work=[[Universe Today]] |accessdate=2 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARX-20181101"&gt;{{cite arxiv |last1=Bialy |first1=Shmuel |last2=Loeb |first2=Abraham |title=Could Solar Radiation Explain ʻOumuamua's Peculiar Acceleration? |date=26 October 2018 |eprint=1810.11490v4|class=astro-ph.EP }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SA-201809287"&gt;{{cite web |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |title=How to Search for Dead Cosmic Civilizations |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/how-to-search-for-dead-cosmic-civilizations/ |date=26 September 2018 |work=[[Scientific American]] |accessdate=26 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scientists have stated that the available evidence is insufficient to consider such a premise.&lt;ref&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2018-11-scientists-harvard-alien-spacecraft-theory.html Scientists push back against Harvard 'alien spacecraft' theory].

In response, [[Avi Loeb]] wrote an article detailing six anomalous properties of `Oumuamua that make it unusual, unlike any comets or asteroids seen before.&lt;ref name="SA-20181120"&gt;{{cite web |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Avi Loeb |title=6 Strange Facts about the Interstellar Visitor 'Oumuamua

On November 27, 2018, [[Avi Loeb]] and his undergraduate student at Harvard College, Amir Siraj, proposed a search for `Oumuamua-like objects which are trapped in the Solar System as a result of losing orbital energy through a close encounter with Jupiter.&lt;ref name="ARX-20181109632"&gt;{{cite arxiv |last1=Siraj |first1=Amir |last2=Loeb |first2=Abraham |title=Identifying Interstellar Objects Trapped in the Solar System through Their Orbital Paramteters |date=27 November 2018 |eprint=1811.09632v2|class=astro-ph.EP }}&lt;/ref&gt; They identified 4 candidates for trapped interstellar objects that could be visited by dedicated missions, and pointed out that future sky surveys, such as with LSST, should find many more.

== Hypothetical space missions ==
{{main|Project Lyra}}
ʻOumuamua was at first thought to be traveling too fast for any existing spacecraft to reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=http://astronomynow.com/2017/11/22/an-interstellar-interloper-is-dashing-through-our-solar-system |title=An interstellar interloper is dashing through our solar system |magazine=Astronomy Now |last=Clarke |first=Stephen |date=22 November 2017 |access-date=24 November 2017 |language=en-US |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chasing ʻOumuamua"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/11/so-you-want-to-send-a-probe-to-catch-up-to-oumuamua/ |title=Chasing ʻOumuamua – unfortunately human technology isn't up to the task |quote=Chemical propulsion just doesn’t close the case in this scenario. |last=Berger |first=Eric |date=22 November 2017 |website=Ars Technica |access-date=23 November 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Initiative for Interstellar Studies]] (i4is) launched [[Project Lyra]] to assess the feasibility of a mission to ʻOumuamua.&lt;ref name=ProjectLyra&gt;{{cite web |title=Project Lyra – A Mission to ʻOumuamua |url=https://i4is.org/what-we-do/technical/project-lyra/ |website=I4IS |publisher=Initiative for Interstellar Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several options for sending a spacecraft to ʻOumuamua within a time-frame of 5 to 10 years were suggested. One option is using first a Jupiter flyby followed by a close solar flyby at {{convert|3|solar radius|e6km e6mi|sigfig=2|lk=in}} in order to take advantage of the [[Oberth effect]].&lt;ref name="Hein2017" /&gt; Different mission durations and their velocity requirements were explored with respect to the launch date, assuming direct impulsive transfer to the intercept trajectory. Using a powered Jupiter flyby, a solar Oberth maneuver and Parker Solar Probe heat shield technology, a Falcon Heavy-class launcher would be able to launch a spacecraft of dozens of kilograms towards 1I/ʻOumuamua, if launched in 2021.{{CN|date=November 2018}} More advanced options of using solar, laser electric, and laser sail propulsion, based on [[Breakthrough Starshot]] technology, have also been considered. The challenge is to get to the asteroid in a reasonable amount of time (and so at a reasonable distance from Earth), and yet be able to gain useful scientific information. To do this, decelerating the spacecraft at ʻOumuamua would be "highly desirable, due to the minimal science return from a hyper-velocity encounter".&lt;ref name="Hein2017" /&gt; If the investigative craft goes too fast, it would not be able to get into orbit or land on the asteroid and would fly past it. The authors conclude that, although challenging, an encounter mission would be feasible using near-term technology.&lt;ref name="Hein2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ProjectLyra /&gt; Seligman and Laughlin&lt;ref name="ARX-20180412"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Seligman |first1=Darryl |last2=Laughlin |first2=Gregory |title=The Feasibility and Benefits of in situ Exploration of ʻOumuamua-like Objects |journal=The Astronomical Journal |volume=155 |issue=5 |pages=217 |date=12 April 2018 |arxiv=1803.07022v2|doi=10.3847/1538-3881/aabd37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; adopt a complementary approach to the Lyra study but also conclude that such missions, though challenging to mount, are both feasible and scientifically attractive.

==Other interstellar objects==
Astronomers estimate that several interstellar objects of extrasolar origin (like ‘Oumuamua) pass inside the orbit of Earth each year,&lt;ref name="NASA-FAQ" /&gt; and that 10,000 are passing inside the orbit of Neptune on any given day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite interview |last=Fraser |first=Wesley |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b09rvpts/the-sky-at-night-the-mystery-of-oumuamua |title=The Sky at Night: The Mystery of ‘Oumuamua |date=11 Feb 2018 |publisher=BBC |interviewer=[[Chris Lintott]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the estimate is correct, this provides future opportunities for studies of interstellar objects. However, with current space technology, close visits and orbital missions are challenging due to their high speeds, though not impossible.&lt;ref name="ARX-20180412" /&gt;

In November 2018, Harvard astronomers reported that there should be hundreds of 'Oumuamua-size interstellar objects in the Solar System, based on calculated orbital characteristics, and presented several known examples, namely, [[2011 SP25]], [[2017 RR2]], [[2017 SV13]], and [[2018 TL6]].&lt;ref name=MNRAS-20181129"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Siraj |first1=Amir |last2=Loeb |first2=Abraham |title=Identifying Interstellar Objects Trapped in the Solar System through Their Orbital Parameters |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.09632.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |date=29 November 2018  |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=000 |pages=1-5 |accessdate=1 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are all orbiting the sun, but with unusual orbits, and are assumed to have been trapped at some occasion.

"Most likely it is of natural origin, but because it is so peculiar, we would like to check if it has any sign of artificial origin, such as radio emissions," said Avi Loeb, professor of astronomy at Harvard University and an adviser to the Breakthrough Listen project. "If we do detect a signal that appears artificial in origin, we’ll know immediately." ... While many astronomers believe the object is an interstellar asteroid, its elongated shape is unlike anything seen in the asteroid belt in our own solar system. Early observations of ʻOumuamua show that it is about 400m long but only one tenth as wide. "It's curious that the first object we see from outside the solar system looks like that," said Loeb. |accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
