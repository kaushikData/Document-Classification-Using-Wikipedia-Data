'''''Animal Coloration''''', or in full '''''Animal Coloration: An Account of the Principal Facts and Theories Relating to the Colours and Markings of Animals''''', is a book by the English [[zoologist]] [[Frank Evers Beddard]], published by Swan Sonnenschein in 1892. It formed part of the [[Coloration evidence for natural selection|ongoing debate amongst zoologists]] about the relevance of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]] to the observed appearance, structure, and behaviour of animals, and vice versa.

Beddard states in the book that it contains little that is new, intending instead to give a clear overview of the subject. The main topics covered are [[camouflage]], then called 'protective coloration'; [[mimicry]]; and [[sexual selection]]. Arguments for and against these aspects of [[animal coloration]] are intensively discussed in the book.

The book was reviewed in 1892 by the major journals including ''The Auk'', ''Nature'', and ''Science''. The scientist reviewers [[Joel Asaph Allen]], [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] and [[Robert Wilson Shufeldt]] took up different positions on the book and accordingly praised or criticized Beddard's work.

Modern evaluation of the book is from a variety of perspectives, including the history of Darwinism, the history of the Thayer debate on the purpose of camouflage, the mechanisms of camouflage, sexual selection, and mimicry. Beddard is seen as having covered a wide swath of modern biology with both theory and experiment.

==Context==
[[File:Animal Coloration by Frank Evers Beddard 1892 title page 1st edition.jpg|thumb| upright| Title page of first edition, 1892]]
{{further|Coloration evidence for natural selection}}

[[Frank Evers Beddard|Beddard]] (1858–1925) was an English zoologist specializing in [[Annelid]] worms, but writing much more widely on topics including mammals and zoogeography. He also contributed articles on [[earthworm]]s, [[leech]]es and [[Nematoda|nematode]] worms to the 1911 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. His decision to write an accessible book on animal coloration falls into this pattern. Beddard wrote ''Animal Coloration'' at a time when scientists' confidence in [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, 1859.&lt;/ref&gt; was at a low ebb. Beddard's book&lt;ref group=P&gt;Beddard, 1892.&lt;/ref&gt; was part of an ongoing debate among [[zoologist]]s about how far natural selection affected animals, and how far [[Alternatives to Darwinism|other forces]] – such as the direct action of light – might be the causes of observed features such as the colours of animals. [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]]'s far more strongly pro-Darwinian book ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'' had appeared just two years earlier in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Poulton, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach==

Beddard explains in his preface that the book grew from his 1890 Davis Lectures given for the public at [[London Zoo]]. The book "contains hardly anything novel, but professes to give some account of the principal phenomena of [[animal coloration|coloration exhibited by animals]]."&lt;ref name=Prefaceiii group=P&gt;Beddard, 1892. p. iii.&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes that since Poulton's recent book "deal[s] with colour almost entirely from the point of view of natural selection, I have attempted to lay some stress upon other aspects of the question."&lt;ref group=P name=Prefaceiii/&gt; Similarly, because Poulton treated insects in some detail, Beddard chooses to give more attention to other groups, though "it is impossible not to devote a good deal of space to insects".&lt;ref group=P name=Prefaceiv group=P&gt;Beddard, 1892. p. iv.&lt;/ref&gt; The examples are mainly from Beddard's own observation of "animals that may be usually seen in the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]]'s Gardens",&lt;ref group=P name=Prefaceiv/&gt; though he also introduces and quotes the work of other scientists, including [[Henry Walter Bates]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]].

===Illustrations===

The book has four colour plates by [[Pierre Jacques Smit|Peter Smit]], who both drew and prepared the [[chromolithography|chromolithographic]] plates. Plate 1 is stated in the ''List of Illustrations'' "To face page 108", but as bound in the first edition it is used as a Frontispiece, facing the title page.

There are also 36 woodcuts (in black and white) in the text, though one of these, "Eolis and Dendronotus" is intentionally repeated as figures 10 and 19 to accompany the text in two places. The woodcuts vary from small line drawings on a simple white background (as in the diagrammatic figure 28 of ''[[Apterona helicoidella|Psyche helix]]'', and figure 34 of the [[winter moth]]) to page-width illustrations like figure 2 which shows [[Stoat|ermines]] in winter pelage, in a realistic depiction with a detailed snowy scene in the background. The woodcuts are certainly by a number of different artists; many are unsigned, but figures 5 and 26 are signed "E.A. Brockhaus X.A" lower right (X=cut, A=Artist), while figure 29 is signed "GM" lower left, and figures 35 and 36 are signed "ES" lower left. Figure 2 bears a monograph "FR", lower left, and figure 7, of the penguin ''[[Aptenodytes patagonicus|Aptenodytes patagonica]]'' is stated to be "from [[Alfred Brehm|Brehm]]" (''[[Brehms Tierleben]]'').

==Structure==

''Animal Coloration'' has a simple structure of six chapters in its 288 pages.

;1. Introductory

:Beddard distinguishes colour, when an animal has just one, from coloration, when there is some kind of pattern of two or more colours. He discusses the mechanisms of colour production, both [[structural coloration]] and [[pigment]]s, and the reasons for coloration, including the red of [[haemoglobin]] used to carry oxygen. Non-adaptive coloration is considered, and a section argues that "the action of natural selection in producing colour changes must be strictly limited".

;2. Coloration affected by the environment

:In this chapter Beddard continues to explore the possible direct effect of the environment, i.e. with "no possible relation to natural selection".&lt;ref group=P&gt;Beddard, 1892. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of different foods, temperature and humidity are discussed. Beddard argues against Poulton's view that natural selection has removed the pigment from cave-dwelling animals, agreeing rather with Wallace that pigment is produced as a by-product. Beddard grants that the change to white of arctic animals in winter looks like natural selection, rather than a direct effect of the environment, but argues that some animals do not change, including the [[musk ox]] which he describes as "comparatively defenceless".

;3. Protective coloration
[[File:Plate II Kallima butterfly from Animal Coloration by Frank Evers Beddard 1892.jpg| thumb| left| upright| Plate II, "''[[Kallima]]'' butterfly". (How many insects are in the image?)]]

:"Protection" is a shorthand in Beddard's vocabulary for [[camouflage]] necessitated by natural selection, whether of prey for defence against [[Predation|predators]] hunting by sight, or of predators concealing themselves for attack on watchful prey. He mentions that Wallace includes the green of tree-frequenting animals and the tawny of desert animals under "General Protective Resemblance", and mentions his own experiments which agree with Poulton's observation that lizards "do pass over and leave unnoticed protectively coloured caterpillars".&lt;ref group=P&gt;Beddard, 1892. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Beddard continually tests the validity of this explanation:

[[File:Plate 1 A group of protectively coloured animals from Animal Coloration by Frank Evers Beddard 1892.jpg|thumb|upright|Plate I, A group of protectively coloured animals.]]
:{{quote|'''Comparative Rarity of Green tree-frequenting Animals an Argument in favour of Selection'''&lt;br/&gt;It is not a little surprising to find how ''few'' green animals there are ... it is precisely because the sandy colour of [[desert]] animals and the transparency of [[pelagic]] organisms is so universal, that some general environmental cause appears to be necessary for the explanation of the facts; on the other hand, the picking and choosing among [[arboreal]] animals savours distinctly of natural selection.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Beddard, 1892. pp. 108-109.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

:He observes that "Every naturalist traveller appears to have some instance to relate of how he was taken in by a protectively-coloured insect. These stories are told with a curiously exaggerated delight at the deception...", giving as example how Professor Drummond in his book ''Tropical Africa'' thought a [[mantid]] was a wisp of hay. He picks up on the casually mentioned fact that Drummond's African companion was not deceived, writing that we should not judge camouflage "from the human standpoint".&lt;ref group=P&gt;Beddard, 1892. pp. 109-110.&lt;/ref&gt;

:On the other hand, Beddard writes that people who had only seen the [[giraffe]], [[zebra]], and [[jaguar]] in the zoo would think them "among the most conspicuously coloured of the [[Mammalia]]", but that seen "in their native countries" they are "most difficult to detect".&lt;ref group=P&gt;Beddard, 1892. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The chapter ends with a discussion of animals that can change colour, including fish like the [[sole (fish)|sole]], the [[chameleon]], the [[horned lizard]]s and the [[tree frogs]] including the European species ''[[Hyla arborea]]''. He cites Poulton's suggestion that the tree frog's camouflage may be both defensive (protecting from predators) and aggressive (facilitating the hunting of insects).&lt;ref group=P&gt;Beddard, 1892. pp. 140-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

;4. Warning coloration
[[File:Plate III Warning Coloration from Animal Coloration by Frank Evers Beddard 1892.jpg| thumb| upright|left| Plate III, "Group of animals exhibiting warning coloration". Illustrated are a [[wasp]], a [[cinnabar moth]] and its caterpillar larva, a [[wasp beetle]], and a [[fire salamander]].]]

:In this chapter Beddard discusses the warning coloration ([[aposematism]]) of animals, which he notes "have a precisely opposite tendency" to camouflage, "viz., to render their possessor conspicuous". He at once says that the explanation was "first devised by [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Mr. Wallace]]" for insects. The chapter therefore begins with the insects, often using English species as examples. He examines critically whether eye-like markings and other warnings actually work. He discusses experiments by [[Edward Bagnall Poulton|Poulton]] on the [[Deilephila elpenor|elephant hawk-moth]], where a [[Lacerta viridis|sand lizard]] is only briefly startled,&lt;ref group=P&gt;Beddard, 1892. p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; and his own at the London zoo using a range of predators and different insects.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Beddard, 1892. pp. 153-156.&lt;/ref&gt; Beddard is only partially convinced, flirting with Dr. Eisig's theory that the pigments creating the colours of caterpillars are inherently distasteful, and hence that "the brilliant colours (i.e. the abundant secretion of pigment) have caused the inedibility of the species, rather than that the inedibility has necessitated the production of bright colours as an advertisement." So Beddard suggests that "the advent of bird-life proved a disastrous event for these animals, and compelled them to undergo various modifications", except when they were already by luck warning coloured and distasteful.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Beddard, 1892. p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

;5. Protective mimicry
[[File:Plate IV Volucellae and Bees from Animal Coloration by Frank Evers Beddard 1892.jpg|thumb|upright|Plate IV ''[[Volucella]]e'' and Bees. The hoverflies are harmless [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian mimics]] of the stinging bees.]]
:This chapter discusses [[Batesian mimicry]], also mentioning observations and opinions of [[Fritz Müller]] and Wallace. Beddard grants that Bates's theory is very strongly supported by the observations that Bates made in South America, especially on butterflies, though again he tests the evolutionary explanation in different cases. He cites Wallace's rules of mimicry, such as that the imitators are always the more defenceless, and always less numerous, than their models,&lt;ref group=P&gt;Beddard, 1892. p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; as covering all the examples he has given. However, he then states various objections, including that "the [[Danaidae]], themselves an uneatable race of butterflies and models for mimicry, resemble in South America the uneatable [[Heliconiidae]]". He points out that this does not meet any of Wallace's rules so it is "not a case of true mimicry", but is "supposed rather to be like that which is seen between various other unpalatable animals". [[Müllerian mimicry]] is not mentioned explicitly in the book, though Beddard does write that this example "tends to the advantage of the insects, for their enemies have to learn fewer colours and patterns, and thus are less likely to make mistakes, than if the lesson to be learnt were an excessively complicated one."&lt;ref group=P&gt;Beddard, 1892. pp. 212-213.&lt;/ref&gt;

:By the end, Beddard concludes that "Nevertheless, cases of mimicry that do occur&amp;mdash;particularly among Lepidoptera&amp;mdash;are often so striking that no other explanation ... seems to account for the finishing touches, at least, of the resemblance". He remains sceptical of cases "which are to be appreciated only by insects", as he considers that insects might not have good enough vision for mimicry to work.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Beddard, 1892. p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

;6. Sexual coloration
[[File:Bird of Paradise from Animal Coloration by Frank Evers Beddard 1892.jpg|thumb|left|"Bird of Paradise", probably ''[[Paradisaea apoda]]'']]

:The final chapter begins with examples of [[sexual dimorphism]], such as "the antlers of the stag, the spurs of the cock... and the gorgeous plumes found in the males of the [[birds of paradise]]", with other examples chosen from across the animal kingdom. Darwin's theory of [[sexual selection]] is explained; Beddard then states the objection that female birds must be supposed to have "a highly-developed aesthetic sense" to choose between similar-looking males, and worse, that females of closely related species must have "immense[ly]" different tastes. He concludes, though, that the question cannot be answered by what we consider improbable, but requires "actual observation".&lt;ref group=P&gt;Beddard, 1892. pp. 265-266.&lt;/ref&gt; He calls Poulton's arguments for sexual selection "very ingenious", but writes that Wallace's two different (non-selective) explanations "might both be accepted". He concludes that "it is quite possible that sexual selection may have played a subordinate part" in producing sexually dimorphic coloration.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Beddard, 1892. p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}

==Reception==

===Contemporary===

====''The Auk''====

The American [[zoology|zoologist]] and [[ornithology|ornithologist]] [[Joel Asaph Allen]] reviewed ''Animal Coloration'' in ''[[The Auk]]'' in 1893.&lt;ref name=Auk&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://sora.unm.edu/node/5743 | title=Beddard's 'Animal Coloration' | author=Allen, Joel Asaph | journal=The Auk |date=April–June 1893 | volume=10 | issue=2 | pages=195–199 | doi=10.2307/4068113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen notes Beddard's remark that the book contains hardly anything novel, so that it is mainly a review of previous theories, but welcomes it as a review of the state of knowledge together with Beddard's critical commentary. Allen notes that Beddard could have gone further in criticising [[August Weismann|Weismann]] and Poulton on colour changes, but is "glad to see [that Beddard] is willing to grant that the influence of an animal's surroundings may exercise a direct influence upon its coloration without the intervention of the agency of 'natural selection.'"&lt;ref name=Auk/&gt;

Allen praises Beddard's "commendable conservatism" in his discussion of camouflage, which he compares to the "credulous spirit" of other authors. Reviewing the chapter on warning coloration, Allen remarks that the [[great horned owl]] is known to prey on the [[skunk]], showing that even such a disagreeably pungent animal can be subject to predation.&lt;ref name=Auk/&gt;

On mimicry, Allen is critical of Bates's theory, arguing that edible mimics (such as flies) are often not protected by resembling distasteful models (such as wasps). Allen notes that Beddard deals with many special cases "as of .. spiders mimicking ants, etc." and finds the arguments against any selective advantage from Batesian mimicry, and so against natural selection, somewhat conclusive. Finally, reviewing the chapter on sexual selection, Allen writes (knowing that Wallace largely rejected sexual selection)&lt;ref name=Auk/&gt;

{{quote|Mr. Beddard appears to wholly reject Mr. Darwin's much admired theory of 'Sexual Selection,' and quotes at length Mr. Wallace's ''reductio ad absurdum'', which, as illustrating the view of an ultra natural selectionist, may well be here transcribed...&lt;ref name=Auk/&gt;}}

Allen then makes some remarks, praising Beddard for the "fine vein of irony" that he uses of

{{quote|alleged instances of sexual selection, as in respect to the mating and 'love dances' of spiders. But on the whole his criticisms are suggestive rather than aggressive." and concludes with "we are glad to welcome so healthy an antidote to this mild phase of scientific lunacy as Mr. Beddard's book on 'Animal Coloration.'&lt;ref name=Auk/&gt;}}

====''Nature''====
[[File:Chameleon (detail) from Animal Coloration by Frank Evers Beddard 1892.jpg|thumb|  Detail of Figure 15, "Chameleon"]]

The zoologist [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]], whose work is referred to throughout Beddard's book, reviewed ''Animal Coloration'' in ''[[Nature (magazine)|Nature]]'' in 1892. Poulton is critical of Beddard and other authors, defending Darwin's theory of natural selection as "the most generally accepted explanation of organic evolution" and insisting that in "case after case" the Darwinian explanation turns out to be correct.&lt;ref  name=PoultonNature&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v46/n1197/abs/046533a0.html | title=Book Review: Animal Coloration: an Account of the Principal Facts and Theories relating to the Colours and Markings of Animals | last=Poulton |first=Edward Bagnall |author-link=Edward Bagnall Poulton |journal=Nature | date=6 October 1892 | volume=46 | pages=533–537 | doi=10.1038/046533a0 | issue=1197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Science''====

The [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] scientist [[Robert Wilson Shufeldt]] reviewed ''Animal Coloration'' in ''Science'' in 1892, praising it as a concise and useful summary of the subject. He admires [[Macmillan Publishers]]' handling of the book with its attractive wood-cuts and coloured lithographic plates. He is pleased to find many Americans in the index. He quotes Beddard's distinction between colour and coloration. He considers that the book brings readers fully up to date and even adds a few new ideas. He recommends the book to all working American naturalists.&lt;ref name=Science&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://library.worldtracker.org/Science/Science%20Magazine/science%20magazine%201880-1894/root/data/Science_1880-1894/html/Science.vol.20.issue.491.year.1892.html | title=Book-Reviews: Animal Coloration by Frank E.

====''Popular Science Monthly''====

The anonymous reviewer in ''Popular Science Monthly'' in December 1892 writes that Beddard has "made a book interesting to both the zoologist and the general reader."&lt;ref name=PSM&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Popular_Science_Monthly_Volume_42.djvu/289 | title=Animal Coloration. By Frank E. Beddard | author=Anon | journal=Popular Science Monthly |date=December 1892 | volume=42 | pages=275–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; On protective coloration, "he raises the question whether as a matter of fact animals are concealed from their foes by their protective resemblances, and shows that there is much evidence on the negative side", and further that such colours are sometimes produced "more simply and directly than by the operation of natural selection." On warning colours, the reviewer notes that Beddard gives "much weight" to Eisig's theory that "the usual bright pigments" in caterpillars (accidentally) cause inedibility, "instead of being produced to advertise it" and that Beddard cautions against assuming that "the sight or taste of animals were the same as that of man".&lt;ref name=PSM/&gt;

===Modern===

Beddard's ''Animal Coloration'' is cited and discussed both by historians of science, and by practising scientists from a number of different fields. For example, the book illuminates the progress of Darwinism, camouflage research, sexual selection, mimicry and the debate on the purpose of animal coloration triggered by Abbott Thayer. These areas are described in turn below.

====Darwinism====
The historian Robinson M. Yost explains that [[Eclipse of Darwinism|Darwinism went into eclipse]] during the 1890s. At that time, most zoologists felt that natural selection could not be the main cause of biological adaptation, and [[alternatives to Darwinism|sought alternative explanations]]. As a result, many zoologists rejected both [[Batesian mimicry]] and [[Müllerian mimicry]].&lt;ref name=Yost&gt;{{cite web | url=http://faculty.kirkwood.edu/ryost/poulton.htm | title=Poulton: Colours | publisher=Kirkwood Community College | accessdate=5 February 2013 | author=Yost, Robinson M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beddard, writes Yost, explained some problems in the theory of mimicry including that, given how many insect species there are, resemblances between species could arise by chance, and that mimicry was sometimes either useless or actually harmful. In Yost's view, Beddard wanted more evidence that natural selection really was responsible. Yost cites the staunch Darwinist Poulton's hostile review of 1892, which asserts the pre-eminence of Darwin's theory.&lt;ref name=PoultonNature/&gt; But, writes Yost, Beddard was not alone in being wary of natural selection.&lt;ref name=Yost/&gt;

====Camouflage====
The zoologist Martin Stevens and colleagues, in 2006, write that "almost all early discussions of camouflage were of the background-matching type", citing Wallace, Poulton, and Beddard, "until the pioneering work of [[Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom|Thayer (1909)]] and [[Adaptive Coloration in Animals|Cott (1940)]]", which added disruptive coloration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/273/1600/2433.full | title=Disruptive contrast in animal camouflage |author1=Stevens, Martin |author2=Cuthill, Innes C |author3=Windsor, Amy MM |author4=Walker, Hannah J | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |date=October 2006 | volume=273 | issue=1600 | pages=2433–2438 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.3614 | pmid=16959632 | pmc=1634902}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cott however both makes use of Beddard as an authority (for the fact that the Hudson's Bay lemming turns white in winter whereas the Scandinavian lemming does not,&lt;ref&gt;Cott, 1940. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; and for his experiments on the effectiveness of prey coloration on predators&lt;ref&gt;Cott, 1940. p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;) and is critical of him for the "extreme and illogical" opinion held by Beddard and other authors that keeping perfectly still is vital to camouflage.&lt;ref name=Cott162&gt;Cott, 1940. p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Cott pointed out on that subject that a cryptic colour scheme makes an animal harder to track and to recognize, even while it is moving.&lt;ref name=Cott162/&gt;

====Sexual selection====
The [[ornithologist]] Geoffrey Edward Hill, writing in 2002, notes that both Poulton and Beddard discuss sexual selection, and both agreed that "sexual selection by female choice is a likely explanation for the bright coloration of at least some species of birds". In contrast, Hill observes, Cott's detailed 1940 book does not mention it at all; like other zoologists including Wallace and Huxley, Cott preferred explanations "firmly rooted in natural selection".&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;{{cite book | title=A Red Bird in a Brown Bag: The Function and Evolution of Colorful Plumage in the House Finch | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Hill, Geoffrey Edward | pages=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mimicry====

The American evolutionary zoologists Jane Van Zandt Brower and [[Lincoln Pierson Brower]] followed up the experiments described in the book (pp.&amp;nbsp;153–159). Beddard, they write, observed the results of feeding the drone fly ''[[Eristalis tenax]]'', a harmless but intimidating Batesian mimic of [[honeybee]]s, to various [[predator]]s. A [[chameleon]], a green [[lizard]], and a sand [[skink]] eagerly consumed the flies, whereas a thrush and a [[great spotted woodpecker]] did not. However, they — like Cott before them, they note — were unable to replicate Beddard's claim that toads would eat insects of any kind, including stinging bees and wasps. They describe their own experimental investigations of bees and their drone fly mimics, like Beddard using toads as the predators, concluding that the Batesian mimicry of the honeybee by the drone fly was "highly effective".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Experimental Studies of Mimicry. 8. Further Investigations of Honeybees (Apis mellifera) and Their Dronefly Mimics (Eristalis spp.) |author1=Brower, Jane Van Zandt |author2=Brower, Lincoln Pierson |author-link2=Lincoln Brower | journal=The American Naturalist |date=May–June 1965 | volume=99 | issue=906 | pages=173–187 | jstor=2459113 | doi=10.1086/282365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Thayer debate====
The [[History of science|historian of science]] Sharon Kingsland, in a 1978 paper on ''[[Abbott Thayer]] and the protective coloration debate'', uses Beddard repeatedly to illuminate the different strands of the argument. She quotes Beddard (p.&amp;nbsp;94) on how difficult the question of animal coloration seemed in the 1890s. Thayer — an artist, not a scientist — had dived head-first into the debate. One of the protagonists, notes Kingsland, was Joel Asaph Allen, who had reviewed Beddard's book, and who believed that the environment directly influenced animal coloration — Kingsland cites Beddard p.&amp;nbsp;54 here —, so natural selection seemed to him an unlikely factor, and he pointed out that blending inheritance would dilute the effect of selection. Furthermore, argues Kingsland, again citing Beddard (p.&amp;nbsp;148), another major protagonist, Alfred Russel Wallace, was emphasizing the problem of conspicuous markings, which could be selected for as warning coloration.&lt;ref name=ThayerDebate&gt;{{cite journal | title=Abbott Thayer and the Protective Coloration Debate | author=Kingsland, Sharon | journal=Journal of the History of Biology | year=1978 | volume=11 | issue=2 | pages=223–244 | jstor=4330710 | doi=10.1007/bf00389300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace went so far as to argue, notes Kingsland, that bright colours in sexual dimorphism "resulted from a surplus of vital energy", citing Beddard p.&amp;nbsp;263 ff. Thayer, on the other hand, had exactly one explanation for everything: natural selection for protective coloration, in particular camouflage by [[countershading]], which radically departed from earlier explanations such as Allen's environmental influences (colours might be affected by light) or Beddard's suggestion that [[dolphin]]s might have dark backs and light bellies as camouflage when seen from above and from below (Kingsland cites Beddard, p.&amp;nbsp;115).&lt;ref name=ThayerDebate/&gt;

[[File:'Arethusa' by Benjamin West, 1802, High Museum of Art.JPG|thumb|''Arethusa'' by Benjamin West (1802)|284x284px]]
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Arethusa''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ær|ᵻ|ˈ|θj|uː|z|ə}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἀρέθουσα}}) was a [[nymph]] and daughter of [[Nereus]] (making her a [[Nereid]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Georgics]]'' 4.344&lt;/ref&gt; who fled from her home in Arcadia beneath the sea and came up as a fresh water fountain on the island of [[Ortygia]] in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Sicily]]. {{Greek myth (nymph)}}

== Mythology ==
The myth of her transformation begins in [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]] when she came across a clear stream and began bathing, not knowing it was the river god [[Alpheus (mythology)|Alpheus]], who flowed down from Arcadia through [[Elis]] to the sea. He fell in love during their encounter, but she fled after discovering his presence and intentions, as she wished to remain a chaste attendant of [[Artemis]]. After a long chase, she prayed to her goddess to ask for protection.  [[Artemis]] hid her in a cloud, but Alpheus was persistent. She began to perspire profusely from fear, and soon transformed into a stream.  Artemis then broke the ground allowing Arethusa another attempt to flee.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 5.710&lt;/ref&gt; Her stream traveled under the sea to the island of Ortygia, but Alpheus flowed through the sea to reach her and mingle with her waters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''[[Description of Greece]]'' 5.7.3&lt;/ref&gt; Virgil augurs for Arethusa a salt-free passage beneath the sea on the condition that, before departing, she grant him songs about troubled loves, not those in her own future, but those of Virgil's friend and contemporary, the poet Cornelius Gallus, whom Virgil imagines dying from unrequited love beneath the famous mountains of Arcadia, [[Maenalus (mythology)|Maenalus]] and [[Lycaeus (mythology)|Lycaeus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Bucolics]]'' 10.1–15 {{cite book  | last = [[Virgil]]  | first =   | authorlink =   |author2=John Van Sickle | title = Virgil's Book of Bucolics.

She told the goddess that while traveling in her stream below the earth, she saw her daughter looking sad as the queen of [[Hades]].&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 5.407&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman writer [[Ovid]] called Arethusa by the name "Alpheias", because her stream was believed to have a subterranean communication with the river [[Alfeios|Alpheius]], in [[Peloponnesus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 5. 487&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Schmitz |first=Leonhard |authorlink=Leonhard Schmitz |title=Alpheias |editor=[[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] |encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |volume=1 |pages=133 |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |location=Boston |year=1867 |url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0142.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613173928/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0142.html |archivedate=2008-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = [[Ovid]]  | first =   | authorlink =   | editor=William S.

Apart from retellings by classical authors including [[Ovid]] and [[Virgil]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] wrote a poem on ''Arethusa'' in 1820.


== Coin of Arethusa ==
As a patron figure of Syracuse, the head of Arethusa surrounded by [[dolphin]]s was a usual type on their coins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Coins/Arethusa.html Coins of Arethusa] (contains verse from [[Ovid]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]); [http://www.pcgs.com/News/Changes-In-The-Depiction-Of-Arethusa-On-The-Coins-Of "Changes in the Depiction of Arethusa on the Coins of Syracuse", PCGS&lt;/ref&gt;  They are regarded as among the most famous and beautiful [[Ancient Greek coins]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paulfrasercollectibles.com/news/coins-and-banknotes/2012-news-archive/syracuse-arethusa-decadrachm-coins-offered-for-sale-in-ancient-coins-auction/ Paul Fraser Coins]{{dead link|date=October 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}, "In his definitive 1990 book "Ancient Greek Coins", the numismatist G. K. Jenkins describes Syracusan decadrachms of this period as "perhaps the most famous of all ancient coins"."&lt;/ref&gt;

== In music ==
[[Karol Szymanowski]], polish classical music composer named "The Fountain of Arethusa" first of his three poems entitled "Myths" for violin and piano.
[[The Saucy Arethusa]] is an 18th-century song about [[HMS Arethusa (1759)|a British naval ship]] named after Arethusa. A song on the album [[Her Majesty the Decemberists]] by [[The Decemberists]] called "Shanty for the Arethusa" is about a different ship called ''Arethusa''. A movement of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s oboe piece ''[[Six Metamorphoses after Ovid|Six Metamorphoses After Ovid]]'' is entitled "Arethusa."

Also [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], the English classical music composer, composed "Sea Songs", a quick march for both brass band and wind band written in 1923, used a Morris Dance tune 'The Royal Princess' which was also known by the title 'The Arethusa', alongside two other shanty tunes 'Admiral Benbow' and 'Portsmouth'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9004">The '''Arkansas–White–Red water resource region''' is one of 21 major geographic areas, or [[Water resource region|regions]], in the first level of classification used by the [[United States Geological Survey]] to divide and sub-divide the [[United States]] into successively smaller [[hydrologic unit]]s. These geographic areas contain either the drainage area of a major river, or the combined drainage areas of a series of rivers.&lt;ref name=USGS_WS&gt;{{cite web|title=Science in Your Watershed - Locate Your Watershed|url=http://water.usgs.gov/wsc/watershed_finder.html|publisher=[[USGS]]|accessdate=2016-10-12}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USGS_HUC&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydrologic Unit Maps|url=http://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html|publisher=[[USGS]]|accessdate=2016-10-12}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arkansas–White–Red region, which is listed with a 2-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) of 11, has an approximate size of {{convert|247,988|sqmi|km2|abbr=off|lk=on|sp=us}}, and consists of 14 subregions, which are listed with the 4-digit HUCs 1101 through 1114.&lt;ref name=USGS_HUC_name&gt;{{cite web|title=Boundary Descriptions and Names of Regions, Subregions, Accounting Units and Cataloging Units|url=https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc_name.html|publisher=[[USGS]]|accessdate=2016-10-12}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This region includes the drainage of the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]], [[White River (Arkansas)|White]], and [[Red River of the South|Red River]] Basins above the points of highest backwater effect of the [[Mississippi River]]. Includes all of [[Oklahoma]] and parts of [[Arkansas]], [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Louisiana]], [[Missouri]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Texas]].&lt;ref name="USGS_HUC_name"/&gt;

'''Beta Sagittarii''' ('''β&amp;nbsp;Sagittarii''', abbreviated '''Beta&amp;nbsp;Sgr''', '''β&amp;nbsp;Sgr''') is the common designation shared by two [[star system]]s in the [[constellation]] of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], themselves designated '''β&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Sagittarii''' (itself a probable [[binary star]]) and '''β&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Sagittarii'''. The two systems are separated by 0.36° in the sky.

* [[Beta1 Sagittarii|β&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Sagittarii]]
* [[Beta2 Sagittarii|β&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Sagittarii]]

β&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Sagittarii's two components are designated '''β&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Sagittarii A''', also named '''Arkab Prior''',&lt;ref name="IAU-CSN"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/WGSN/IAU-CSN.txt | title=IAU Catalog of Star Names |accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''β&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Sagittarii B''' (sometimes designated '''Arkab Prior A''' and '''B'''). β&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Sagittarii is named '''Arkab Posterior'''.&lt;ref name="IAU-CSN"/&gt; Beta Sagittarii is also referred to by the traditional name '''Arkab'''.

==Nomenclature==
''β&amp;nbsp;Sagittarii'' ([[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] to ''Beta Sagittariii'') is the groups's [[Bayer designation]]; ''β&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''β&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Sagittarii'', those of its two constituents. The designations of ''β&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'s'' components - ''β&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Sagittarii A'' and ''B'' - derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for [[multiple star system]]s, and adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU).&lt;ref name="planetnaming"&gt;{{cite arXiv |title=On the naming convention used for multiple star systems and extrasolar planets |date=2010 |eprint=1012.0707 |class=astro-ph.SR |last1= Hessman |first1=F.

The system's traditional name ''Arkab'' derives from the [[Arabic]] عرقوب ''&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;arqūb'' meaning ''Achilles Tendon''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almaany.com/ar/dict/ar-ar/%D8%B9%D8%B1%D9%82%D9%88%D8%A8/ http://www.almaany.com/ar/dict/ar-ar/%D8%B9%D8%B1%D9%82%D9%88%D8%A8/ - تعريف و معنى عرقوب في معجم المعاني الجامع - معجم عربي عربي تعريف و معنى عرقوب في معجم المعاني الجامع - معجم عربي عربي]&lt;/ref&gt; The two constituents bore the traditional names ''Arkab Prior'' and ''Arkab Posterior'' since ''β&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'' leads ''β&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' (or ''β&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' follows ''β&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'') across the sky.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In 2016, the [[International Astronomical Union]] organized a [[IAU Working Group on Star Names|Working Group on Star Names]] (WGSN)&lt;ref name="WGSN"&gt;{{citation

[[Image:Atraumatisches Nahtmaterial 17.JPG|right|thumb|Surgical suture on [[needle holders]]. Packaging shown above. Note these are not catgut sutures, but polypropylene.]]

'''Catgut suture''' is a type of [[surgical suture]] that is naturally degraded by the body's own [[proteolytic]] [[enzyme]]s. Absorption is complete by 90 days, and full [[tensile strength]] remains for at least 7 days. This eventual disintegration makes it good for use in rapidly healing tissues and in internal structures that cannot be re-accessed for suture removal.

Catgut suture has high knot-pull tensile strength and good knot security due to special excellent handling features. It is used for all surgical procedures including general closure, ophthalmic, orthopedics, obstetrics/gynecology and gastrointestinal surgery. It is absorbed faster in patients with cancer, [[anemia]], and [[malnutrition]]. It also absorbed faster when used in the [[mouth]] and the [[vagina]], due to the presence of [[microorganism]]s.

Catgut has largely been replaced by synthetic absorbable polymers such as [[Vicryl]] and [[polydioxanone]]. It is not used at all for human surgery in some countries. In Europe and Japan, gut sutures have been banned due to concerns that they could transmit [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad-cow disease), although the herds from which gut is harvested are certified BSE-free.

==Manufacture==
Catgut suture is made by twisting together strands of purified [[collagen]] taken from the [[Serous membrane|serosal]] or [[submucosa]]l layer of the [[small intestine]] of healthy [[ruminant]]s ([[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[goat]]s) or from [[beef]] [[tendon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Wray, David B.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NFGSSSbaWjwC&amp;pg=PA1974#v=onepage&amp;f=false|page=1974|chapter=Sutures and Suture Materials: Absorbable Sutures: Surgical Gut|title=Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy|edition=21st|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]] |location=Baltimore, Maryland; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|year=2006|isbn=0-7817-4673-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The natural plain thread is precision ground in order to achieve a monofilament character and treated with a [[glycerol]]-containing solution. The suture is sterilized with a sterilizing fluid containing [[ethylene oxide]], isopropyl alcohol and distilled water.&lt;ref name=sterilization&gt;{{cite web|title=Catgut Sutures|url=http://www.dolphinsutures.com/resources/information-on-catgut|publisher=Dolphin Sutures|accessdate=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catgut suture is straw-colored, and is available in sizes USP 6-0 (1 metric) to USP 3 (7 metric).
Although the name implies the usage of guts of cats, there is no record of feline guts being used for this purpose. The word catgut is deived from the term kitgut or kitstring (the string used on a kit, or fiddle). Misinterpretation of the word kit as referring to a young cat led to the use of the term catgut. Surgical gut is in fact made from the submucosa of sheep intestine or the serosa of bovine intestine and is approximately 90% collagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fossum |first=Theresa |date=2013|title=Small Animal Surgery |page=66 |isbn=9780323100793|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/small-animal-surgery/fossum/978-0-323-10079-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps another possible explanation of the name is the combination of the words cattle and gut. B Braun Medical AG, a German Multi National company first industrialized catgut suture and Catgut is a brand registered with B Braun.

==Variants==
Catgut Chrome (B Braun) suture is a variant treated with [[chromic acid]] salts. This treatment produces roughly twice the stitch-holding time of plain catgut, but greater tissue inflammation occurs. Full [[tensile strength]] is extended to 18&amp;ndash;21 days. It is brown rather than straw-colored, and has improved smoothness due to the dry presentation of the thread (plain catgut is wet). It is otherwise similar to plain catgut.&lt;ref name=sterilization/&gt;

Fast catgut suture is heat-treated to give even more rapid absorption in the body.

==History==
The first known absorbable sutures were made of the [[intestine]]s of sheep. The manufacturing process was similar to that of natural musical strings for [[violin]]s and [[guitar]], and also of natural strings for tennis racquets.

Gut strings were being used as medical sutures as early as the 3rd century AD as [[Galen]], a prominent Greek physician from the [[Roman Empire]], is known to have used them.&lt;ref name="Nutton2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nutton|first=Dr Vivia|title=Ancient Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PREr9_rojrQC|accessdate=21 November 2012|date=2005-07-30|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US|isbn=9780415368483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Central Asia–China gas pipeline''' (known also as '''Turkmenistan–China gas pipeline''') is a [[natural gas]] [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] system from [[Central Asia]] to [[Xinjiang]] in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. By connecting Turkmenistan to China’s domestic grid, this pipeline makes it possible to transport gas some 7000 km from Turkmenistan to Shanghai&lt;ref&gt;M. Anker, P. Baev, B. Brunstad, I.

==History==
The initial proposal for Central Asia–China gas pipeline was presented as the Kazakhstan–China gas pipeline, which was to follow along the [[Kazakhstan-China oil pipeline]]. In June 2003, during China's President [[Hu Jintao]]'s visit to Kazakhstan, agreements to expedite the appraisal of the project were signed.&lt;ref name=china&gt;

 | date=2004-08-25
 | accessdate=2007-07-27}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Following these agreements, [[KazMunayGas]] and [[PetroChina]] started a feasibility study of the pipeline project.  At the same time China continued negotiations with other Central Asian countries.

On 3 April 2006, China and Turkmenistan signed a framework agreement on the pipeline construction and long-term gas supply.&lt;ref name=rfere&gt;

==Significance==
According to CNPC, the inflow of Turkmen gas helps China in meeting its energy demands and stabilizes the country's overall consumption structure. It was expected that the pipeline's deliveries boost the natural gas proportion of energy consumption of China by an estimated 2%, which reduces the overall smoke, dust and carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref name=chinastake&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  For Turkmenistan, the project helps the country diversify its energy exports by delivering gas eastward as opposed to its previous deliveries to [[Russia]] and [[Iran]]. Until the inauguration of the pipeline, nearly 70% of Turkmenistan's gas exports transited through Russian pipelines.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Central Asia–China gas pipeline is the first pipeline to bring Central Asian natural gas to China and highlights China's quest for Central Asian energy exports. While Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are also considering selling their gas to China, Chinese government already made new moves to penetrate deeper into Central Asian energy sector by lending $3&amp;nbsp;billion to Turkmenistan to develop the South Iolotan field in 2009 and $10&amp;nbsp;billion to Kazakhstan to pay for future oil supplies.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1076">A '''chassis ground''' is a link between different metallic parts of a machine to ensure an electrical connection between them. Examples include electronic instruments and motor vehicles.

== Usages ==
; [[Electronics]] : Most electronics systems have their circuits reference-linked to the chassis while the chassis itself is often, but not always, linked to the Earth.
; [[Motor vehicle]]s : Most motor vehicles use the chassis as the reference for all electrical peripherals which allow the use of only one wire for each accessory.

== Confusion ==
The chassis must not be considered as a link to the Earth. Depending on the usage of electrical machines this may, or may not, be the case. For example, in all [[car]]s metallic parts are linked together but they are not linked to the Earth&lt;ref&gt;This explain potential electrical discharge when leaving a car.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This article requires several grammatical corrections.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cherry blossom''' is a [[flower]] of several trees of genus  ''[[Prunus]]'', particularly the '''Japanese cherry''', ''[[Prunus serrulata]]'', which is called '''sakura''' after the Japanese ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:桜#Japanese|桜]]}} or {{lang|ja|[[wikt:櫻#Japanese|櫻]]}}; {{lang|ja|[[wikt:さくら|さくら]]}}).&lt;ref&gt;The history and cultural symbolism of both the seven wild species and the hundreds of forms known for centuries as ''sato-zakura'', or garden cherries and information about growing and propagating is found in {{cite web |title=Japanese Flowering Cherries |date=2015-03-06 |first=Wybe |last=Kuitert |publisher=Timber Press |url=http://www.issuu.com/jtvr/docs/japanese_flowering_cherries_by_wybe/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/unabridged?va=sakura |title=Sakura |encyclopedia=Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged |year=2002 |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |quote=Japanese flowering cherry |accessdate=2008-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/unabridged?book=Third&amp;va=japanese+flowering+cherry |title=Japanese flowering cherry |encyclopedia=Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged |year=2002 |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |quote=any of certain ornamental hybrid cherries developed in Japan chiefly from two species (''Prunus serrulata'' and ''P. sieboldii'') that bear a profusion of white or pink usually double and often fragrant flowers followed by small inedible fruit... |accessdate=2008-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the varieties that have been cultivated for ornamental use produce small, unpalatable fruit. Edible [[cherry|cherries]] generally come from cultivars of the related species ''[[Prunus avium]]'' and ''[[Prunus cerasus]]''.

{{Main|Hanami}}
"Hanami" is the centuries-old practice of picnicking under a blooming ''sakura'' or ''[[ume]]'' tree. The custom is said to have started during the [[Nara period]] (710–794), when it was ''ume'' blossoms that people admired in the beginning, but by the [[Heian period]] (794–1185) cherry blossoms came to attract more attention, and ''hanami'' was synonymous with ''sakura''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHf8lxLOYsUC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Hanami+nara#v=onepage&amp;q=Hanami%20nara&amp;f=false|page=12|title=Mizue Sawano: The Art of the Cherry Tree|author= Brooklyn Botanic Garden |publisher= Brooklyn Botanic Garden|year= 2006 |isbn= 1-889538-25-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, in both [[waka (poetry)|waka]] and [[haiku]], {{nihongo|"flowers"|花|hana}} meant "cherry blossoms". The custom was originally limited to the elite of the Imperial Court, but soon spread to [[samurai]] society and, by the [[Edo period]], to the common people as well. [[Tokugawa Yoshimune]] planted areas of cherry blossom trees to encourage this. Under the ''sakura'' trees, people had lunch and drank [[sake]] in cheerful feasts.

[[File:Hiroshige, 36 Views of Mount Fuji Series 7.jpg|thumb|upright|Woodblock print of [[Mount Fuji]] and cherry blossom from ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (Hiroshige)|Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]'' by [[Hiroshige]]]]

Every year the Japanese Meteorological Agency and the public track the ''sakura zensen'' ([[cherry blossom front]]) as it moves northward up the archipelago with the approach of warmer weather via nightly forecasts following the weather segment of news programs. The blossoming begins in [[Okinawa]] in January, and typically reaches [[Kyoto]] and Tokyo at the end of March or the beginning of April. It proceeds into areas at the higher altitudes and northward, arriving in [[Hokkaido]] a few weeks later. Japanese pay close attention to these forecasts and turn out in large numbers at parks, shrines and temples with family and friends to hold flower-viewing parties. ''Hanami'' festivals celebrate the beauty of the cherry blossom and for many are a chance to relax and enjoy the beautiful view. The custom of ''hanami'' dates back many centuries in Japan. The eighth-century chronicle ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (日本書紀) records ''hanami'' festivals being held as early as the third century AD.

Most Japanese schools and public buildings have cherry blossom trees outside of them. Since the fiscal and school year both begin in April, in many parts of [[Honshu]], the first day of work or school coincides with the cherry blossom season.

The Japan Cherry Blossom Association developed a list of Japan's Top 100 Cherry Blossom Spots&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan's Top 100 Cherry Blossom Spots – GoJapanGo (English language version of list)|url=http://www.gojapango.com/travel/japans_top_100_cherry_blossom_spots.htm|work=Japan's Top 100 Cherry Blossom Spots – GoJapanGo|publisher=Mi Marketing Pty Ltd|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with at least one location in every prefecture.

== Symbolism in Japan ==
[[File:100JPY.JPG|thumb|right|A [[100 yen coin]] depicting cherry blossom]]

In Japan, cherry blossoms symbolize clouds due to their nature of blooming ''{{lang|Fr|en masse}}'', besides being an enduring metaphor for the ephemeral nature of life,&lt;ref name=khoon&gt;Choy Lee, Khoon. ''Japan—between Myth and Reality''. 1995, page 142.&lt;/ref&gt; an aspect of Japanese cultural tradition that is often associated with Buddhist influence,&lt;ref&gt;Young, John and Nakajima-Okano, Kimiko. ''Learn Japanese: New College Text''. 1985, page 268.&lt;/ref&gt; and which is embodied in the concept of ''[[mono no aware]]''.&lt;ref name=Slaymaker&gt;Slaymaker, Douglas. ''The Body in Postwar Japanese Fiction''. 2004, page 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The association of the cherry blossom with ''mono no aware'' dates back to 18th-century scholar [[Motoori Norinaga]].&lt;ref name=Slaymaker /&gt; The transience of the blossoms, the exquisite beauty and volatility, has often been associated with mortality&lt;ref name=khoon /&gt; and graceful and readily acceptance of destiny and karma; for this reason, cherry blossoms are richly symbolic, and have been utilized often in [[Japanese art]], [[manga]], [[anime]], and film, as well as at musical performances for ambient effect. There is at least one popular [[folk song]], originally meant for the [[shakuhachi]] (bamboo flute), titled "[[Sakura (folk song)|Sakura]]", and several [[j-pop|pop songs]]. The flower is also represented on all manner of consumer goods in Japan, including [[kimono]], stationery, and [[dishware]].

The ''[[Sakurakai]]'' or Cherry Blossom Society was the name chosen by young officers within the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in September 1930 for their secret society established with the goal of reorganizing the state along [[totalitarian]] [[militarist]]ic lines, via a military coup d'état if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;James L. McClain, ''Japan: A Modern History'' p 414 {{ISBN|0-393-04156-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, the cherry blossom was used to motivate the Japanese people, to stoke nationalism and militarism among the populace.&lt;ref name=ohnuki&gt;[[Ohnuki-Tierney, Emiko]]. ''Kamikaze, Cherry Blossoms, and Nationalisms''. 2002, page 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Even prior to the war, they were used in propaganda to inspire "Japanese spirit", as in the "Song of Young Japan", exulting in "warriors" who were "ready like the myriad cherry blossoms to scatter".&lt;ref&gt;[[Piers Brendon]], ''The Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s'', p441 {{ISBN|0-375-40881-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, [[Akiko Yosano]]'s poetry urged Japanese soldiers to endure sufferings in China and compared the dead soldiers to cherry blossoms.&lt;ref&gt;James L. McClain, ''Japan: A Modern History'' p 427 {{ISBN|0-393-04156-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments that the plans for the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], involving all Japanese ships, would expose Japan to serious danger if they failed, were countered with the plea that the Navy be permitted to "bloom as flowers of death".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Toland (author)|John Toland]], ''[[The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936–1945]]'' p 539 Random House New York 1970&lt;/ref&gt; The last message of the forces on [[Peleliu]] was "Sakura, Sakura" — cherry blossoms.&lt;ref&gt;Meirion and Susie Harries, ''Soldiers of the Sun: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial Japanese Army'' p 424 {{ISBN|0-394-56935-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese pilots would paint them on the sides of their planes before embarking on a suicide mission, or even take branches of the trees with them on their missions.&lt;ref name=ohnuki /&gt; A cherry blossom painted on the side of the bomber symbolized the intensity and ephemerality of life;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sakamoto, Kerri]]: ''One Hundred Million Hearts''. Vintage Book, 2004. {{ISBN|0-676-97512-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in this way, the aesthetic association was altered such that falling cherry petals came to represent the sacrifice of youth in suicide missions to honor the emperor.&lt;ref name=ohnuki /&gt;&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;[[Ivan Morris]], ''The Nobility of Failure: Tragic Heroes in the History of Japan'', p290 Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[kamikaze]] unit had a subunit called ''Yamazakura'' or wild cherry blossom.&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt; The government even encouraged the people to believe that the souls of downed warriors were reincarnated in the blossoms.&lt;ref name=ohnuki /&gt;

In its colonial enterprises, Imperial Japan often planted cherry trees as a means of "claiming occupied territory as Japanese space".&lt;ref name=ohnuki /&gt;

Cherry blossoms are a prevalent symbol in [[Irezumi]], the traditional art of Japanese tattoos. In tattoo art, cherry blossoms are often combined with other classic Japanese symbols like [[koi fish]], [[dragons]] or [[tigers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freetattoodesigns.org/cherry-blossom-tattoo.html#sakura |title=Cherry Blossom Tattoo Designs |publisher=Freetattoodesigns.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was later used for the [[2020 Summer Paralympics|Tokyo 2020 Paralympics]] mascot [[Miraitowa and Someity|Someity]].

== Varieties and blooming ==
[[File:Cerejeira pg.jpg|thumb|''Prunus serrulata'' in [[Ponta Grossa]], [[southern Brazil]].]]

[[File:White Sakura Cherry Blossoms.jpg|thumb|right|White cherry blossoms (sakura)]]
The most popular variety of cherry blossom in Japan is the ''[[Prunus × yedoensis|Somei Yoshino]]''. Its flowers are nearly pure white, tinged with the palest pink, especially near the stem. They bloom and usually fall within a week, before the leaves come out. Therefore, the trees look nearly white from top to bottom. The variety takes its name from the village of Somei (now part of [[Toshima, Tokyo (ward)|Toshima]] in Tokyo). It was developed in the mid- to late-19th century at the end of the [[Edo period]] and the beginning of the [[Meiji period]]. The ''Somei Yoshino'' is so widely associated with cherry blossoms that ''[[jidaigeki]]'' and other works of fiction often depict the variety in the [[Edo period]] or earlier; such depictions are anachronisms.

Winter ''sakura'' or ''fuyuzakura'' (''[[Prunus subhirtella]] autumnalis'') begins to bloom in the fall and continues blooming sporadically throughout the winter. It is said to be a cross between ''edohiganzakura'', the Tokyo Higan cherry (''P. incisa'') and ''mamezakura'' (''P. pendula'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fe20060104li.html "Winter-flowering cherry"]. Retrieved 1 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other categories include ''yamazakura'', ''yaezakura,'' and ''shidarezakura''. The '''''yaezakura''''' have large flowers, thick with rich pink petals. The ''shidarezakura'', or weeping cherry, has branches that fall like those of a weeping willow, bearing cascades of pink flowers.

=== Australia ===
[[File:07. Japanese Garden Pano, Cowra, NSW, 22.09.2006.jpg|thumb|Panoramic view from the Symbolic Mountain at the [[Japanese garden]]s. The view takes in the gardens and the plains of the [[Cowra Shire Council|Cowra district]] across to the nearby mountains.]]
During [[World War II]], a [[prisoner of war]] (POW) camp near the town of [[Cowra, New South Wales|Cowra]] in New South Wales, Australia, was the site of one of the largest [[prison escape]]s of the war, on 5 August 1944. During the [[Cowra breakout]] and subsequent rounding up of POWs, four Australian soldiers and 231 Japanese soldiers died and 108 prisoners were wounded. The Japanese War Cemetery holding the dead from the Breakout was tended after the war by members of the Cowra [[Returned and Services League of Australia|RSL]] and ceded to Japan in 1963. In 1971 the Cowra Tourism Development decided to celebrate this link to Japan, and proposed a [[Japanese garden]] for the town. The Japanese government agreed to support this development as a sign of thanks for the respectful treatment of their war dead; the development also received funding from the Australian government and private entities.

The garden was designed by [[Ken Nakajima]] (1914–2000), a world-renowned designer of Japanese gardens at the time. The first stage was opened in 1979, and a second stage in 1986. The gardens were designed in the style of the [[Edo period]] and are a ''kaiyū-shiki'' or strolling garden. They are designed to show all of the landscape types of Japan. At five hectares (12 acres), the Cowra Japanese Garden is the largest Japanese garden in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. An annual cherry blossom festival during September is now a major event in Cowra's tourism calendar.

[[File:CuritibaPracaDoJapaoCerejeira.JPG|thumb|Cherry blossom in the Praça do Japão (Japan Square), [[Curitiba]], [[Brazil]]]]
With the [[Japanese Brazilians#Beginning|Japanese diaspora to Brazil]], many immigrants brought [[seedling]]s of cherry trees. In [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo State]], home to the largest Japanese community outside Japan, it is common to find them in Japan-related facilities and in some homes, usually of the cultivars ''[[Prunus serrulata]]'' 'Yukiwari' and ''Prunus serrulata'' var. ''lannesiana'' 'Himalaya'. Some cities, as [[Garça]]&lt;ref name=Garca&gt;{{cite web|title=Festa da Cerejeira em Garça recebe mais de 150 mil visitantes|url=http://g1.globo.com/sp/bauru-marilia/noticia/2014/07/festa-da-cerejeira-em-garca-recebe-mais-de-150-mil-visitantes.html|publisher=TV TEM|accessdate=7 July 2015|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Campos do Jordão]],&lt;ref name=Campos&gt;{{cite web|title=Festa da Cerejeira em Flor 2014 celebra a Cultura do Japão em Campos do Jordão|url=http://www.guiadecamposdojordao.com.br/campos-do-jordao-noticias/Festa%20da%20Cerejeira%20em%20Flor%202014%20acontece%20em%20Julho%20e%20Agosto%20em%20Campos%20do%20Jord%C3%A3o-5560.html|publisher=Guia de Campos do Jordão|accessdate=7 July 2015|language=Portuguese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707164403/http://www.guiadecamposdojordao.com.br/campos-do-jordao-noticias/Festa%20da%20Cerejeira%20em%20Flor%202014%20acontece%20em%20Julho%20e%20Agosto%20em%20Campos%20do%20Jord%C3%A3o-5560.html|archivedate=7 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; have annual festivals to celebrate the blooming of the trees and the Japanese culture. In the [[Paraná (state)|Parana State]] (in [[southern Brazil]]), many cities received many of these immigrants, who planted the trees, as in [[Apucarana]],&lt;ref name="saka"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cerejeiras enfeitam cidade no norte do Paraná| publisher=Jornal Nacional|language=Portuguese| accessdate=2011-07-15| url=http://jornalnacional.globo.com/Telejornais/JN/0,,MUL1243172-10406,00-CEREJEIRAS+ENFEITAM+CIDADE+NO+NORTE+DO+PARANA.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maringá]], [[Cascavel]]&lt;ref name="cass"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cerejeiras enfeitam Cascavel| publisher=Globo Vídeos|language=Portuguese| accessdate=2011-07-15| url=http://video.globo.com/Videos/Player/Noticias/0,,GIM1552862-7823-CEREJEIRAS+ENFEITAM+CASCAVEL,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and especially in the capital city of [[Curitiba]].&lt;ref name="cur1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Temporada das Cerejeiras em Curitiba| publisher=Diário Urbano|language=Portuguese| accessdate=2011-07-15| url=http://diariourbano.com.br/2010/07/06/temporada-cerejeiras-em-curitiba/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Curitiba|capital city of Paraná]], the first seedlings were brought by Japanese immigrants in the first half of the 20th century, but large quantities of them were only planted from the 1990s, with the opening of the [[Botanical Garden of Curitiba]].&lt;ref name="cur1" /&gt; Nowadays the seedlings are produced locally and used in [[afforestation]]&lt;ref name="cur2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Novo colorido em parques e praças| publisher=Prefeitura de Curitiba|language=Portuguese| accessdate=2011-07-15| url=http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/noticias/cerejeiras-dao-novo-colorido-a-parques-e-pracas/23547}}&lt;/ref&gt; of streets and [[Town square|squares]] – as in the Japanese Square, where there are more than 30 cherry trees around the square which were sent by the [[Japanese Empire]] to Curitiba.&lt;ref name="cur3"&gt;{{cite web |title=Japan Square| publisher=Prefeitura de Curitiba| accessdate=2011-07-15| url=http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/idioma/ingles/pracajapao}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
[[Vancouver]], British Columbia is famous for its thousands of cherry trees (estimated 50,000) lining many streets and in many parks, including [[Queen Elizabeth Park, British Columbia|Queen Elizabeth Park]] and [[Stanley Park]]. Vancouver holds the [[Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival]] every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=26 April 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; With multiple varieties and a temperate climate, they begin to bloom in February yearly and peak in April.

[[High Park]] in [[Toronto]], Ontario features many Somei-Yoshino cherry trees (the earliest species to bloom and much loved by the Japanese for their fluffy white flowers) that were given to Toronto by Japan in 1959. Through the Sakura Project, the Japanese Consulate donated a further 34 cherry trees to [[High Park]] in 2001, plus cherry trees to various other locations like [[Exhibition Place]], [[McMaster University]], [[York University]] (near Calumet College and on Ottawa Road near McLaughlin College) and the [[University of Toronto]]'s main (next to Robarts Library) and Scarborough campuses. Niagara Falls also has many near the Falls itself. [[Royal Botanical Gardens (Ontario)|Royal Botanical Gardens]] in Burlington and Hamilton was also the recipient of a number of Somei-Yoshino cherry trees that were donated by the Consulate-General of Japan in Toronto as part of the Sakura Project. The trees are located in the Arboretum and the Rock Garden and were planted to celebrate the continual strengthening of friendship between Japan and Canada. Peak bloom time at Royal Botanical Gardens is normally around the last week of April or the first week of May.

=== China ===
Cherry trees naturally grow in the middle northern or southern part of China, the area nearby the sea. However, the most famous cherry blossom parks in China reflect Japan's brief occupation of parts of China during the first half of the 20th century or the donation from Japan thereafter:
* [[Longwangtang Cherry Blossom Park]] in [[Lushunkou District|Lushun]], [[Dalian]], [[Liaoning]]
* [[East Lake Cherry Blossom Park]] near [[Wuhan University]], in [[Donghu District]], [[Wuhan]], [[Hubei]]
* [[Wuhan University]], in [[Donghu District]], [[Wuhan]], [[Hubei]]
* [[Nanshan Subdistrict, Chongqing|Nanshan]] Botanical Garden in [[Nan'an District]], [[Chongqing]]

=== France ===
[[File:Cerisiers en fleurs au parc de Sceaux.JPG|thumb|Blooming cherry blossom trees in [[Parc de Sceaux]], France]]
[[Parc de Sceaux]], located in a suburb of [[Paris]], has two orchards of cherry trees, one for white cherry blossoms ([[Prunus avium]]) and one for pink cherry blossoms ([[Prunus serrulata]]), the latter with about 150 trees that attract many visitors when they bloom in early April.

=== Germany ===
The cherry blossom is a major tourist attraction in Germany's [[Altes Land]] [[orchard]] region. The largest Hanami in Germany, in [[Hamburg]], with Japanese-style fireworks, organized by the German-Japanese society, draws tens of thousands spectators every spring. Starting in 2015, Hamburg will be allowed to bestow the title of "Cherry Blossom Queen" by the [[Japan Cherry Blossom Association]], one of only three cities worldwide to receive this privilege. The first Cherry Blossom Queen of Hamburg will be crowned by the Cherry Blossom Queen of Japan on May 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.djg-hamburg.de/aktuelles.html|publisher=Deutsch-Japanische Gesellschaft zu Hamburg e.V.|accessdate=2015-04-25|title=Aktuelles aus der Gesellschaft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, along prior sections of the Berlin Wall, Japan donated cherry blossoms to express appreciation of German reunification. The gift was supported by donations from the Japanese people allowing for over 9,000 trees to be planted. The first trees were planted in November of that year near [[Glienicker Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sakura Campaign - The State of Berlin|url=http://stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/umwelt/stadtgruen/stadtbaeume/en/sakura/index.shtml|website=Berlin.de|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cherry Blossom festival in the Bonn Altstadt is also very famous: [[:de:Kirschblütenfest Bonn]].

=== India ===

[[File:Zosterops palpebrosus 2.jpg|thumb|[[Oriental white-eye]] in a wild Himalayan cherry]]
In [[India]], the cherry blossom is an attraction as well, most notably in Himalayan states like [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir]], [[Sikkim]] &amp; northern districts of [[West Bengal]] of [[Jalpaiguri]] and [[Darjeeling]]. Temple towns like [[Kalpa, Himachal Pradesh|Kalpa]], [[Sarahan]], [[Chitkul]], [[Sangla, India|Sangla]] and [[Narkanda]] are notable for their wild cherry blossom during spring covering Himalayan foothills. They can also be seen in various British-era [[botanical gardens]] especially in [[Nilgiri Hills]], [[Garo Hills]], [[Khasi Hills]] as well as in some [[hill stations]] in the [[Western Ghats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/india-tour/shillong/cherry-blossoms-in-shillong|title=Cherry Blossoms in Shillong|work=mapsofindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prunus cerasoides]] is '''wild Himalayan cherry''' and '''sour cherry''',&lt;ref name=GRIN&gt;{{GRIN | ''Prunus cerasoides'' | 29865 | accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; known in [[Hindi]] as '''padma''' or '''padmakashtha''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Wild%20Himalayan%20Cherry.html |title=''Cerasus cerasoids'' – Wild Himalayan Cherry |author=Navendu Pāgé |publisher=Flowers of India |accessdate=July 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a deciduous [[cherry tree]] found in parts of [[East Asia|East]], [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. It is of the family ''[[Rosaceae]]'' and the genus ''[[Prunus]]''.
Recently Kolkata municipal department and the forest department planted cherry blossoms across main city places like Rajarhat. They were in full bloom the first week of March 2017.

=== Korea ===
[[File:Cherry blossoms at POSTECH.jpeg|thumb|Cherry blossoms at POSTECH, [[South Korea]]]]
The origins of cherry blossoms in South Korea is contentious. The Japanese planted [[Prunus × yedoensis|Yoshino cherry]] trees at Seoul's [[Changgyeonggung]] Palace and the viewing of cherry blossoms was introduced to [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea during Japanese rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | script-title=ko:가슴과 어깨에 벚꽃을 꽂고 희생 다짐하는 18세 조종사 | url=http://www.koreadaily.com/news/read.asp?art_id=917888 | publisher=Joongang | accessdate=2009-01-03|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festivals continued even after the Japanese surrendered at the end of WWII but have been controversial, and many cherry trees were cut down to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Japanese surrender because they were seen as symbols of the occupation.&lt;ref name=ohnuki122&gt;Ohnuki-Tierney, Emiko.

In the year 2000, the Japan Women's Club (JWC) donated 400 cherry blossom trees to the city of [[Amstelveen]]. The trees have been planted in the cherry blossom park in the [[Amsterdamse Bos]]. A special detail is that every tree has a name — 200 trees have female Japanese names, 200 trees have female Dutch names.

=== Taiwan ===
Typically found in mountainous areas, cherry blossoms are a popular attraction in Taiwan, with numerous specially tailored viewing tours. Among the most easily accessible and thus most popular locations for viewing them are [[Yangmingshan]], in [[Taipei]], and [[Wuling Farm]], in [[Taichung]].

=== Thailand ===

In 2005, Japanese cherry trees were presented by Japan to the [[Nezahat Gökyiğit Botanical Garden]] in [[Istanbul]], Turkey. Each tree represents one sailor of the [[Ertugrul Frigate|frigate ''Ertogrul'']] which was a famous frigate of the Ottoman Turkish navy. On the way back from a goodwill visit to Japan in 1890 she ran into a [[typhoon]] and sank with loss of 587 Ottoman Turkish sailors. That loss is being remembered at every anniversary. The Japanese cherry trees represent memory of those who died and provide remembrance.

Japan gave 3,020 cherry blossom trees as a gift to the United States in 1912 to celebrate the nations' then-growing friendship, replacing an earlier gift of 2,000 trees which had to be destroyed due to disease in 1910. These trees were planted in [[Sakura Park]] in Manhattan and line the shore of the [[Tidal Basin (District of Columbia)|Tidal Basin]] and the roadway in [[East Potomac Park]] in Washington, D.C. The first two original trees were planted by first lady [[Helen Herron Taft|Helen Taft]] and [[Chinda Sutemi|Viscountess Chinda]] on the bank of the Tidal Basin. The gift was renewed with another 3,800 trees in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Also, Balboa Park of San Diego has 2,000 cherry blossom trees that blossom in mid to late March. In Los Angeles, over 2,000 trees are located at [[Lake Balboa]] in [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California|Van Nuys]]. These trees were donated by an anonymous Japanese benefactor and were planted in 1992.

[[Philadelphia]] is also home to over 2,000 flowering Japanese cherry trees, half of which were a gift from the Japanese government in 1926 in honor of the 150th anniversary of American independence, with the other half planted by the Japan America Society of Greater Philadelphia between 1998 and 2007. Philadelphia's cherry blossoms are located within [[Fairmount Park]], and the annual [[Subaru Cherry Blossom Festival of Greater Philadelphia]] celebrates the blooming trees. The [[University of Washington]] in Seattle also has cherry blossoms in its Quad.

Other US cities have an annual cherry blossom festival (or ''sakura matsuri''), including the [[International Cherry Blossom Festival]] in [[Macon, Georgia]], which features over 300,000 cherry trees. The [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]] in New York City also has a large, well-attended festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbg.org/exp/cherries/sakura.html |title=BBG.org |publisher=BBG.org |date=2008-04-26 |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], is the site of the peace conference that produced the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]], for which the original Washington, DC cherry trees were given in thanks.

Cherry blossoms and leaves are edible and both are used as food ingredients in Japan:
* The blossoms are pickled in salt and [[Umeboshi|umezu (ume vinegar)]], and used for coaxing out flavor in [[wagashi]], (a [[traditional]] Japanese confectionery,) or [[anpan]], (a Japanese sweet [[bun]], most-commonly filled with [[red bean paste]]).
* Salt-pickled blossoms in hot water are called [[sakurayu]], and drunk at festive events like weddings in place of [[green tea]].
* The [[Leaf|leaves]], mostly from the [[Prunus speciosa|Ōshima cherry]] because of the softness, are also pickled in salted water and used for [[sakuramochi]].

Since the leaves contain [[coumarin]], which is toxic in large doses, it is not recommended to eat them in great quantities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2611">In [[Greek mythology]], '''Comaetho''' ({{IPAc-en|k|oʊ-|ˈ|m|iː|θ|oʊ}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: Κομαιθώ ''Komaithṓ'' means "bright-haired"''&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Graves]]. ''[[The Greek Myths]] (1960)''&lt;/ref&gt;'') is a name that may refer to:

*Comaetho, a [[nymph]] of a spring who incessantly mingles her waters with those of the river god [[Cydnus]], who in one passage of [[Nonnus]]' ''[[Dionysiaca]]'' is said to be her father,&lt;ref&gt;''Dionysiaca'' 2. 143-144&lt;/ref&gt; and in another her consort.&lt;ref&gt;''Dionysiaca'' 40. 141-143&lt;/ref&gt;
*Comaetho, a beautiful girl of [[Patrae]] who served as priestess in the temple of [[Artemis]] Triclaria and was in love with [[Melanippus]]. They were not allowed to marry each other, so they met secretly in the temple and had sex together. The outraged goddess sent famine and plague upon the city; to propitiate her, the inhabitants had to sacrifice both Comaetho and Melanippus to her. Since then, a young man and a young girl were sacrificed to the goddess each year until, in accordance with the instructions of the [[Delphi]]an oracle, a strange king ([[Eurypylus (king of Thessaly)|Eurypylus]], son of Euaemon) introduced the worship of a new deity ([[Dionysus]], whose image he brought from [[Troy]]) in Patrae, thus both putting an end to the sacrifices and curing himself of madness which had been sent upon him when he had first looked at the god's image.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 7. 19. 1-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taphians remained invincible until Comaetho out of love for Amphitryon cut off her father's golden hair, the possession of which rendered him immortal.

The '''Dark Matter Particle Explorer''', or '''DAMPE''' (also known as '''Wukong'''), is a [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] (CAS) satellite which launched on 17 December 2015.&lt;ref name="Barbosa 2015"/&gt; The satellite was launched on a [[Long March 2D]] rocket from Launch Pad 603 at the LC-43 complex, also known as the [[Jiuquan Launch Area 4|South Launch Site]], at the [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]].&lt;ref name="Barbosa 2015"/&gt; It is China's first ever space observatory.

DAMPE is a [[Space observatory|space telescope]] used for the detection of high energy [[gamma ray]]s, [[electron]]s and [[cosmic ray]] ions, to aid in the search for [[dark matter]].&lt;ref name="Barbosa 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/missions/space-observatories/china-to-launch-its-first-dark-matter-probe-by-the-end-of-2015/|title=China to launch its first dark matter probe by the end of 2015|work=Spaceflight Insider|date=2 June 2015|first=Tomasz|last=Nowakowski|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed to look for the indirect decay signal of a hypothetical dark matter candidate called [[weakly interacting massive particles]] (WIMPs).&lt;ref name="Normile-2015-11-29"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/11/china-s-dark-matter-space-probe-detects-tantalizing-signal |title=China's dark matter space probe detects tantalizing signal |last=Normile |first=Dennis |work=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=29 November 2017 |accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
{{expand section|date=March 2018}}
First results were released in Nov 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://phys.org/news/2017-11-china-dampe-dark.html | title=First finding of China's DAMPE may shed light on dark matter research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming==
The space observatory is nicknamed '''Wukong''' ({{zh|悟空}}) after the [[Monkey King]], who is the hero in the classic Chinese tale ''[[Journey to the West]]''.
Literally, "wu"(悟) means comprehension or understanding and "kong"（空）means void, so this name could also be understood as "understanding the void", relating to the undiscovered nature of dark matter.&lt;ref name="Wukong" /&gt;

The English name, DAMPE, was a [[backronym]], which was named after a NPC in ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', '''Dampé''' ({{jp|ダンペイ}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://m.265g.com/pc/news/1712/18792.html | title=悟空卫星英文名DAMPE竟源自《塞尔达传说》}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the game, player need Dampé to find the treasure, which match with the mission of DAMPE (not finding dark matter, but finding the evidence that dark matter exist).

'''[[World energy resources and consumption|Energy]]''' in '''[[Saudi Arabia]]''' involves [[petroleum production|petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] production, consumption, and exports, and [[Electricity generation|electricity]] production. Saudi Arabia is the world's leading oil producer and exporter.
Saudi Arabia's economy is petroleum-based; oil accounts for 90% of the country's exports and nearly 75% of government revenue.&lt;ref name = Factbook/&gt;
The oil industry produces about 45% of Saudi Arabia's gross domestic product, against 40% from the private sector.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt; Saudi Arabia has per capita GDP of $20,700.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt; The economy is still very dependent on oil despite diversification, in particular in the [[petrochemical]] sector.

For many years the Kingdom has been the world's largest petroleum producer and exporter. In 2011 it pumped about {{convert|10.782|Moilbbl/d|lk=on}} of petroleum.&lt;ref name = Factbook/&gt;  While most of this is exported, domestic use is rapidly increasing, primarily for electricity production.
Saudi Arabia also has the largest, or one of the largest, proven crude oil reserves (i.e. oil that is economically recoverable&lt;ref name=Atzori&gt;{{cite web|last=Atzori|first=Daniel|title=Is Saudi Arabia really running out of oil?|url=https://www.abo.net/oilportal/topic/view.do?contentId=2000557|work=September 30, 2012|publisher=About Oil|accessdate=23 April 2014|quote=Saudi Arabia’s proved oil reserves amounted, at the end of 2011, to 265,4 thousand million barrels. Despite the fact that Venezuela, with proved oil reserves of 296,5 thousand million barrels, recently surpassed Riyadh,}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Venezuela has more oil in the form of tar sands, heavy bitumen which is not currently economically competitive.&lt;/ref&gt;) in the world (18% of global reserves, over {{convert|260|Goilbbl}}).

Saudi Arabia, has one of the largest reserves of natural gas in the [[Persian Gulf]]. Proven natural gas reserves are over {{convert|7|e12m3|abbr=off}}.

[[File:AramcoCoreArea.jpg|thumb|Saudi Aramco's Core Area in [[Dhahran]]]]

===Reserves===
{{Main article|Oil reserves in Saudi Arabia}}
As of January 2007, Saudi [[Aramco]]'s proven reserves were estimated at {{convert|259.9|Goilbbl}}, comprising about 24% of the world total.&lt;ref name="Aramco"/&gt;  They would last for 90 years at the current rate of production.  85% of Saudi oil fields found have not produced oil yet.&lt;ref name=MN&gt;http://www.simmonsco-intl.com/files/Kuwait%20Talk.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ghawar oil field]] is the largest oil field in the world, holding over {{convert|70|Goilbbl}}. Ghawar is able to produce {{convert|5|Moilbbl/d}} of oil.&lt;ref name="Aramco"/&gt;  Aramco announced {{convert|100|koilbbl/d}} expansion and integration with neighboring petrochemical plants in Ras Tanura and Yanbu by 2010 to 2012.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;

However, according to journalist [[Karen Elliott House]], "some energy experts are convinced that current reserves are substantially lower than those officially claimed by Saudis and that the depletion rate is substantially faster."&lt;ref name="house-245"/&gt; 
According to a former senior executive of the state-run Aramco oil company [[Sadad Ibrahim Al Husseini]] the country's real oil reserves are 40% lower than the official estimate of 716 billion barrels of oil.&lt;ref name=Vivienne&gt;{{cite web|last=Walt|first=Vivienne|title=Have Saudis Overstated How Much Oil Is Left?|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2048242,00.html|date=10 February 2011|publisher=TIME magazine|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; House states, "no convincing evidence ever has been provided to support the increase [in Saudi oil reserves]. And tellingly, in 1982 the kingdom and other OPEC oil producers ceased releasing production data by field. ... Finally, Saudi Arabia has not revised its reserve estimate since 1988, even though it has pumped somewhere between 5 million and 9 million barrels a day for the intervening two decades, for a total of nearly 50 billion barrels."&lt;ref name="house-245"&gt;{{cite book|author=House, Karen Elliott|title=On Saudi Arabia : Its People, past, Religion, Fault Lines and Future| publisher=Knopf|year=2012|pages=245–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New oil fields====
New oil fields will add up to {{convert|3.6|Moilbbl/d}} to production capacity by 2011. The new fields are Haradh, Khurais, Khusaniyah, Manifa, Neutral Zone (shared with Kuwait), Nuayyin and Shaybah I II &amp; III.

===Production===
{{see also|History of the oil industry in Saudi Arabia}}
Saudi-Arabia is the major oil producer in the world accounting for 12.9% of the global production.&lt;ref name=IEA2012&gt;[http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/kwes.pdf Key world statistics 2012] IEA&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi Arabia produces over {{convert|10|Moilbbl/d}} of oil,&lt;ref name = Factbook&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sa.html |title=The World Factbook – Saudi Arabia |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; exporting {{convert|8.9|Moilbbl/d}}. The government is investing over $71&amp;nbsp;Billion to increase oil production to near {{convert|12|Moilbbl/d}} by 2009 and up to {{convert|12.5|Moilbbl/d}} by 2015.&lt;ref name = EIA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov |title=Energy Information Agency, Country Analysis Briefs 2007 |publisher=Eia.doe.gov |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be attributed to the report that {{convert|700|koilbbl}} of excess capacity are needed to compensate for a natural decline in availability.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;

The future of Saudi Arabian oil is complicated by the fact that the major Saudi oil fields are extremely old and have been producing oil for decades. Corrosion is becoming a large problem in addition to many other problems that come over time. The result is that most of the easily produced oil is gone from these fields and tapping the rest of the oil is probably going to be much more difficult and more expensive. Such increased difficulty and expense may indicate that Saudi Arabian oil fields have already peaked.&lt;ref name=MN/&gt;

===Shipping===
The majority of the oil is shipped via [[supertankers]] to refineries around the world. Three major ports are used for the shipping. [[Ras Tanura]] is the world's largest offshore oil loading facility with {{convert|6|Moilbbl/d}} capacity. The [[Ras al-Ju'aymah]] facility, on the coast of the [[Persian Gulf]], loads nearly 75% of the exports. The last of the three largest terminals is the [[Yanbu]] terminal located on the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt; The enormous sea shipping capacity is vital to Saudi Arabia given the absence of international pipelines.

===Export===
For many years Saudi's ability to increase production of oil and stabilize price spikes led it to be compared to an international  central bank and be called a "central bank of oil‘.&lt;ref name=Atzori/&gt;

===Consumption===
The Kingdom's consumption of its own oil production has steadily increased and it now consumes about one quarter of its oil production (approximately three million barrels per day).&lt;ref name=Atzori/&gt; As of 2012 petrol in Saudi Arabia was sold at a price cheaper than bottled water—approximately $.50 US per gallon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=House, Karen Elliott|title=On Saudi Arabia : Its People, past, Religion, Fault Lines and Future| publisher=Knopf|year=2012|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Jim Krane, "Saudi Arabia now consumes more oil than Germany, an industrialized country with triple the population and an economy nearly five times as large."&lt;ref name=Atzori/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303816504577319571732227492?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702303816504577319571732227492.html The End of the Saudi Oil Reserve Margin] (behind paywall) By Jim Krane |''Wall Street Journal''| 3 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a report by Citigroup’s analyst Heidy Rehman, "As a result of its subsidies we calculate 'lost' oil and gas revenues to Saudi Arabia in 2011 to be over $80 billion",&lt;ref&gt;Saudi Arabian power providers pay $5 to $15 a barrel for its fuel from state-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co., according to the report. Brent crude, the benchmark for more than half the world’s oil, traded at $116 a barrel&lt;/ref&gt; adding that "at the domestic level, we believe the only real way to rationalize energy consumption would be to reduce subsidy levels."&lt;ref name=Atzori/&gt;

===Aramco===
Until 1973 the government did not receive a share of the oil drilled within its boundaries. In 1973 the Saudi government gained a 25% share of the interest from Aramco.&lt;ref name = Aramco&gt;
[http://www.saudiaramco.org Saudi Aramco History]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 the Saudi government purchased nearly 100% of the Aramco oil business giving Saudi officials complete control over prices and production. In 1988 the oil company was renamed [[Saudi Aramco]].&lt;ref name="Aramco"/&gt; The company is controlled by the government but also has a board of advisors and a CEO. The current CEO and President of Saudi Aramco is Amin H. Al-Nasser.&lt;ref name="Aramco"/&gt;

===Future perspectives===
The future prospects of energy in Saudi Arabia have been studied extensively by the King Abdullah Pertroleum Studies and Research Center (KAPSARC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matar|first=Walid|last2=Echeverri|first2=Rodrigo|last3=Pierru|first3=Axel|date=1 December 2015|title=The Prospects for Coal-Fired Power Generation in Saudi Arabia|ssrn=2749596|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/KS-1519-DP013A-Efficient-Industrial-Energy-Use_The-First-Step-in-Transitioning-Saudi-Arabia%E2%80%99s-Energy-Mix.pdf|title=Efficient Industrial Energy Use: The First Step in Transitioning Saudi Arabia’s Energy Mix|last=Matar|first=Walid|date=|website=KAPSARC|publisher=KAPSARC|access-date=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Saudi officials are not concerned about alternative energy sources hurting the market for its exports.   In a recent interview with [[CBS]], they asked Saudi Arabia’s oil minister the following question: "Let me be blunt, okay? And ask you to be candid: is it Aramco’s hope to prevent a switch away from oil? Somebody said, 'The country is the oil business.' You absolutely need to do this for your own survival".&lt;ref name=KL&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/12/05/60minutes/main4650223_page6.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody | work=CBS News | title=Saudi Arabia Bullish On Oil's Future}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minister responded by stating that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 “Yeah, we admit a fact that yes, we depend on the oil industry. We want it to help us, you know, to develop our economy and develop the economy of the world. So what is good for the wellbeing of Saudi Arabia should be good for the wellbeing of the world, too… we have to be realistic. We don't have the alternatives today”.&lt;ref name=KL/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Saudi oil policy is shaped by multiple factors and as these factors change and/or as new information becomes available, Saudi Arabia’s oil policy will also change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oxfordenergy.org/publications/phases-saudi-oil-policy-next/|title=The Phases of Saudi Oil Policy: What Next? - Oxford Institute for Energy Studies|newspaper=Oxford Institute for Energy Studies|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural gas==
Saudi Arabia has the world's fourth largest reserves of natural gas, of {{convert|240|e12cuft|abbr=off}}. One-third of this reserve is found in the Ghawar.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt; Before the master gas system, the oil company flared (burned) the gas as it came from the oil well. Until recently production of natural gas was tightly controlled as it is so closely linked to oil production. The [[World Trade Organization]] criticized the government and Aramco for heavily subsidizing natural gas. According to the [[Energy Information Administration]] the price was $0.75 MMBtu American dollars.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;

==Electricity==
[[File:Power lines in the desert (3849151403).jpg|thumb|Power line in the desert near Riyadh]]
Saudi Arabia is the fastest growing electricity consumer in the Middle East, particularly of transportation fuels. In 2005, Saudi Arabia was the world's 15th largest consumer of primary energy, of which over 60 percent was petroleum-based. The remainder was made up of natural gas.

Two ministries share responsibility for the energy sector: the Ministry of Oil and the Ministry of Water and Electricity. The Ministry of Water was created in 2001 by merging water related sub-departments. Its stated purpose is "to prepare a comprehensive plan to establish water and sewage networks all over the Kingdom. It will also develop the country’s water policies and propose new regulations to preserve water."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudinf.com/main/c6x.htm |title=Ministry of Water and Electricity – SAMIRAD (Saudi Arabia Market Information Resource) |publisher=Saudinf.com |date=20 April 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/saudi.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015183758/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/saudi.html |archivedate=15 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, this department was expanded.

===Electricity consumption===
[[Electricity consumption]] in Saudi Arabia increased sharply during the 1990–2010 period due to rapid economic development. Peak loads reached nearly 24 GW in 2001—25 times their 1975 level-and are expected to approach 60 GW by 2023.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt; The investment needed to meet this demand may exceed $90&amp;nbsp;billion. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop energy conservation policies for sustainable development.

Electricity generation is 40% from Oil 52% from Natural Gas and 8% from steam. Generation capacity is approximately 55 GW.&lt;ref name="EIAsaudi"&gt;http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=SA&lt;/ref&gt; A looming energy shortage requires Saudi Arabia to increase its capacity. Capacity is planned to be increased to 120 GW by 2032.&lt;ref name="EIAsaudi" /&gt;

The government has approved the construction of a $300&amp;nbsp;million facility to turn waste into energy. The facility will process 180 tons of waste per day, producing 6 MW of electricity and {{convert|250000|USgal|m3}} of distilled water.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;

===Conservation===
Towards the end of 1998, the electricity sector embarked upon a major restructuring program. One of its aims was to achieve sustainable performance. Although progress has been made, remaining challenges, include high demand growth, low generation capacity reserve margins, inefficient energy use, absence of time-of-use rate adjustments, and the need for large capital investments to fund expansion.

Current sustainable policies, particularly those encouraging energy conservation, led to peak load savings of more than 871 MW in 2001, mainly as a result of collaboration between the Ministry of Water and Electricity and the Saudi Electricity Company.

Policies and programs are being developed for public awareness, energy regulation and legislation, and energy information and programming. If energy conservation is successful, demand can be reduced by 5–10%. This is equivalent to 3–6 GW of additional capacity, which represents a possible $1.5–3.0&amp;nbsp;billion saving over 20 years. Typically, investment in energy efficiency is 1% of utility sales revenues, which for a country like Saudi Arabia could be $15–60&amp;nbsp;million annually. If only savings on air conditioning are considered, the return on investment is equivalent to 400–500 MW of generating capacity—a saving of up to $0.25&amp;nbsp;billion p.a.

===Bureaucratic history===
The development of electricity in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia can be divided into two stages:

Phase 1: Initially, electricity generation was left to small, local companies. Such companies sold power at varying rates according to local costs.

In 1961 (1381 [[Hijri year|AH]]), the Department of Electricity Affairs was established within the Ministry of Commerce, with a mandate to regulate the electricity generation sector and to issue permits and licenses to electricity companies and to encourage national investment.

In 1972 (1392 AH), the Department of Electricity Services was established. This Department was separated from the Ministry of Commerce and was given the additional responsibility of planning electrical services for the Kingdom as a whole.

In 1974 (1394 AH), the Ministry of Commerce was divided into the Commerce Agency and the Industry and Electricity Agency. In that same year, the electricity tariff was set for all companies at a level below their actual costs.

In 1975 (1395 AH), the Government adopted ambitious plans for economic development requiring investment in industry and electrification. The Ministry of Industry and Electricity was formed, with an Industrial Affairs Agency and an Electricity Affairs Agency. The Electricity Affairs Agency expanded the planning, co-ordination and regulatory roles for providing electrical services. The Electricity Corporation was established in 1976 (1396 AH) to coordinate the electricity plans contained in the Kingdom's Development Plan.

From 1976 to 1981 (1396 – 1401 AH) all community electricity generation was gradually subsumed under the four regional Saudi Consolidated Electricity Companies (SCECOs), located in the Central, Eastern, Southern and Western regions.

With the formulation of a coherent development plan and the establishment of the SCECOs, the Government was able to bring electricity to the towns, villages and settlements throughout the Kingdom.

The number of electricity customers grew from 216,000 in 1970 (1390 AH) to 3,035,000 in 1996 and 4,955,906 in 2006.

In May 2003, electricity was made the responsibility of the Ministry of Water and Electricity.

===Saudi Consolidated Electricity Companies (SCECOs)===
The first SCECO (SCECO-East) was created in 1976 (1396/97 AH). This was followed in 1979 (1399/1400 AH) by SCECO-South. Electricity for the southwest is provided by another consolidated company, and the central region is served by SCECO-Central.

The General Electricity Corporation (GEC) had overall responsibility for the Kingdom's electricity system and had direct responsibility for the provision of electrical supplies to rural areas not then covered by the consolidated companies. The GEC represented the government equity holdings in all the independent electricity generating companies and was a source of finance for those companies' capital requirements.

In 1998, the Government announced the reorganization of the electricity sector by establishing a stock market company, named the Saudi Electric Company, through the merger of all the electricity companies operating in the Kingdom.

=== Solar power ===
{{main article|Solar power in Saudi Arabia}}
During the [[2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Energy in Qatar|Qatar]] Saudi-Arabia announced its target to receive third of its electricity demand from [[solar power]] with 41GW of solar capacity by 2032. Same time was announceed investment in 17 new nuclear reactors in next 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/26/saudi-arabia-solar-strategy  Saudi Arabia announces $109bn solar strategy] [[The Guardian]] 26 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear power===
{{Main article|Nuclear energy in Saudi Arabia|Nuclear program of Saudi Arabia}}
In 2010, [[King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy]] was established.  The Saudi government plans a $100 billion program of nuclear power with the goal of generating 110 gigawatts by 2032, using at least 12 nuclear power plants which are intended to begin coming into operation in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudis, Emirates push nuclear power plans|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Resources/2012/07/26/Saudis-Emirates-push-nuclear-power-plans/UPI-96201343332843/|accessdate=29 November 2012|newspaper=UPI|date=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been negotiating with France, China, Japan, Korea, Russia, and Argentina over access to nuclear technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harvey|first=Fiona|title=Saudi Arabia reveals plans to be powered entirely by renewable energy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/19/saudi-arabia-renewable-energy-oil|newspaper=The Guardian (UK)|date=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Golden Field Guides''' are a series of larger pocket-sized books that were created by [[Western Publishing]] and published under their "Golden Press" line (mostly used for children's books at the time), as a related series to the [[Golden Guide]]s. Edited by [[Herbert Zim]] and Vera Webster, the books were written by experts in their field and illustrated with a simple straightforward style.

Unlike the Golden Guides, the Field Guides went more in-depth, being more aimed at the high school/college level. They also had sturdier covers, obviously intending that they be used in the field. Most note that they are a "Guide to Field Identification" on the cover. To go more in-depth and intended as both identification and educational, most of the Field Guides limited themselves to North America, while the Golden Guides were usually worldwide.

The series, updated, was relaunched in 2001 as "Golden Field Guides by [[St. Martin's Press]]". Certain titles have been discontinued, such as the ''Amphibians of North America'' and ''Families of Birds'' books.

A '''grove''' is a small group of [[tree]]s with minimal or no undergrowth, such as a [[sequoia grove]], or a small [[orchard]] planted for the [[Plant cultivation|cultivation]] of [[fruit]]s or [[nut (fruit)|nuts]]. Other words for groups of trees include ''[[woodland]]'', ''[[woodlot]]'', ''[[thicket]]'', or ''[[Stand level modelling|stand]]''.

{{wiktionary|grove}}
The main meaning of "[[wikt:grove|grove]]" is a group of trees that grow close together, generally without many bushes or other plants underneath. It is an old word in English, with records of its use dating as far back as 1,000 years ago, although the word's true origins are unknown.

Naturally-occurring groves are typically small, perhaps a few acres at most.  Orchards, by contrast, may be small or very large, like the apple orchards in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], and orange groves in [[Florida]].

Historically, groves were considered sacred in pagan, pre-Christian Germanic, Nordic and Celtic cultures. Helen F. Leslie-Jacobsen argues that "we can assume that sacred groves actually existed due to repeated mentions in historiographical and ethnographical accounts. e.g. [[Tacitus]], ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]''."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/12703338/The_Sacred_Grove_in_Scandinavian_Germanic_Pre-Christian_Religion  Helen F.

'''Hardness''' is a measure of the resistance to localized plastic deformation induced by either mechanical indentation or abrasion. Some materials (e.g. [[Metal|metals]]) are harder than others (e.g. [[Plastic|plastics]], [[wood]]). Macroscopic hardness is generally characterized by strong [[intermolecular bond]]s, but the behavior of solid materials under force is complex; therefore, there are different measurements of hardness: ''scratch hardness'', ''indentation hardness'', and ''rebound hardness''.

Hardness is dependent on [[ductility]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] [[stiffness]], [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]], [[deformation (mechanics)|strain]], [[Strength of materials|strength]], [[toughness]], [[viscoelasticity]], and [[viscosity]].

Common examples of '''hard matter''' are [[ceramic]]s, [[concrete]], certain [[metal]]s, and [[superhard material]]s, which can be contrasted with [[soft matter]].

==Measuring hardness==
[[Image:Vickers-tester.jpg|thumb|A Vickers hardness tester]]

There are three main types of hardness measurements: ''scratch'', ''indentation'', and ''rebound''. Within each of these classes of measurement there are individual measurement scales. For practical reasons [[hardness comparison|conversion tables]] are used to convert between one scale and another.

===Scratch hardness{{Anchor|Scratch hardness}}===

{{main|Scratch hardness}}

Scratch hardness is the measure of how resistant a sample is to [[fracture]] or permanent [[plastic deformation]] due to friction from a sharp object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wredenberg|first=Fredrik|author2=PL Larsson|title=Scratch testing of metals and polymers: Experiments and numerics|journal=Wear|date=2009|doi=10.1016/j.wear.2008.05.014|volume=266|issue=1–2|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is that an object made of a harder material will scratch an object made of a softer material. When testing coatings, scratch hardness refers to the force necessary to cut through the film to the substrate. The most common test is [[Mohs scale]], which is used in [[mineralogy]]. One tool to make this measurement is the [[sclerometer]].

Another tool used to make these tests is the pocket hardness tester. This tool consists of a scale arm with graduated markings attached to a four-wheeled carriage. A scratch tool with a sharp rim is mounted at a predetermined angle to the testing surface. In order to use it a weight of known mass is added to the scale arm at one of the graduated markings, the tool is then drawn across the test surface. The use of the weight and markings allows a known pressure to be applied without the need for complicated machinery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.byk.com/en/instruments/products/download.php?doc=74 Hoffman Scratch Hardness Tester] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323002752/https://www.byk.com/en/instruments/products/download.php?doc=74 |date=2014-03-23 }}. byk.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indentation hardness===
{{main|Indentation hardness}}

Indentation hardness measures the resistance of a sample to material deformation due to a constant compression load from a sharp object. Tests for indentation hardness are primarily used in [[engineering]] and [[metallurgy]] fields. The tests work on the basic premise of measuring the critical dimensions of an indentation left by a specifically dimensioned and loaded indenter.

Common indentation hardness scales are [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell]], [[Vickers hardness test|Vickers]], [[Shore scale|Shore]], and [[Brinell hardness test|Brinell]], amongst others.

===Rebound hardness===
Rebound hardness, also known as ''dynamic hardness'', measures the height of the "bounce" of a diamond-tipped hammer dropped from a fixed height onto a material. This type of hardness is related to [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. The device used to take this measurement is known as a [[scleroscope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Allen | first = Robert | title = A guide to rebound hardness and scleroscope test | date = 2006-12-10 | url = http://www.articlestree.com/science/a-guide-to-rebound-hardness-and-scleroscope-test-tx301428.html | accessdate = 2008-09-08 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120718022923/http://www.articlestree.com/science/a-guide-to-rebound-hardness-and-scleroscope-test-tx301428.html | archivedate = 2012-07-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two scales that measures rebound hardness are the [[Leeb rebound hardness test]] and [[Bennett hardness scale]].

==Hardening==
{{Main|Hardening (metallurgy)}}

There are five hardening processes: [[Hall-Petch strengthening]], [[work hardening]], [[solid solution strengthening]], [[precipitation hardening]], and [[martensitic transformation]].

==Physics==
[[Image:stress-strain1.svg|thumb|Diagram of a [[stress-strain curve]], showing the relationship between [[Stress (physics)|stress]] (force applied per unit area) and [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] or [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] of a ductile metal.]]

In [[solid mechanics]], solids generally have three responses to [[force]], depending on the amount of force and the type of material:
* They exhibit [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]—the ability to temporarily change shape, but return to the original shape when the pressure is removed. "Hardness" in the elastic range—a small temporary change in shape for a given force—is known as [[stiffness]] in the case of a given object, or a high [[elastic modulus]] in the case of a material.
* They exhibit [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]]—the ability to permanently change shape in response to the force, but remain in one piece. The [[Yield (engineering)|yield strength]] is the point at which elastic deformation gives way to plastic deformation. Deformation in the plastic range is non-linear, and is described by the [[stress-strain curve]]. This response produces the observed properties of scratch and indentation hardness, as described and measured in materials science. Some materials exhibit both [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and [[viscosity]] when undergoing plastic deformation; this is called [[viscoelasticity]].
* They [[fracture]]—split into two or more pieces.

[[Strength of materials|Strength]] is a measure of the extent of a material's elastic range, or elastic and plastic ranges together. This is quantified as [[compressive strength]], [[shear strength]], [[tensile strength]] depending on the direction of the forces involved. [[Ultimate strength]] is an engineering measure of the maximum load a part of a specific material and geometry can withstand.

[[Brittleness]], in technical usage, is the tendency of a material to fracture with very little or no detectable plastic deformation beforehand. Thus in technical terms, a material can be both brittle and strong. In everyday usage "brittleness" usually refers to the tendency to fracture under a small amount of force, which exhibits both brittleness and a lack of strength (in the technical sense). For perfectly brittle materials, yield strength and ultimate strength are the same, because they do not experience detectable plastic deformation. The opposite of brittleness is [[ductility]].

The [[toughness]] of a material is the maximum amount of [[energy]] it can absorb before fracturing, which is different from the amount of [[force]] that can be applied. Toughness tends to be small for brittle materials, because elastic and plastic deformations allow materials to absorb large amounts of energy.

Hardness increases with decreasing [[particle size]]. This is known as the [[Hall-Petch relationship]]. However, below a critical grain-size, hardness decreases with decreasing grain size. This is known as the inverse Hall-Petch effect.

Hardness of a material to deformation is dependent on its microdurability or small-scale [[shear modulus]] in any direction, not to any [[Stiffness|rigidity]] or [[stiffness]] properties such as its [[bulk modulus]] or [[Young's modulus]]. Stiffness is often confused for hardness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Jeandron | first = Michelle | title = Diamonds are not forever | journal = Physics World | date = 2005-08-25 | url = http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/22997 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090215064216/http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/22997 | archivedate = 2009-02-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = San-Miguel | first = A. | last2 = Blase | first2 = P. | title = High Pressure Behavior of Silicon Clathrates: A New Class of Low Compressibility Materials | journal = Physical Review | volume = 83 | issue = 25 | date = 1999-05-19 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.5290 | pages = 5290 | last3 = Blase | first3 = X. | last4 = Mélinon | first4 = P. | last5 = Perez | first5 = A. | last6 = Itié | first6 = J. | last7 = Polian | first7 = A. | last8 = Reny | first8 = E. | last9 = Cros | first9 = C. | last10 = Pouchard | first10 = M. | bibcode=1999PhRvL..83.5290S| display-authors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some materials are stiffer than diamond (e.g. osmium) but are not harder, and are prone to [[spall]]ing and flaking in squamose or acicular habits.

===Mechanisms and theory===
[[Image:Close-packed spheres.jpg|thumb|A representation of the crystal lattice showing the planes of atoms.]]

The key to understanding the mechanism behind hardness is understanding the metallic [[microstructure]], or the structure and arrangement of the atoms at the atomic level. In fact, most important metallic properties critical to the manufacturing of today’s goods are determined by the microstructure of a material.&lt;ref name="Haasen"&gt;Haasen, P. (1978). Physical metallurgy. Cambridge [Eng.] ; New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; At the atomic level, the atoms in a metal are arranged in an orderly three-dimensional array called a [[crystal lattice]]. In reality, however, a given specimen of a metal likely never contains a consistent single crystal lattice. A given sample of metal will contain many grains, with each grain having a fairly consistent array pattern. At an even smaller scale, each grain contains irregularities.

There are two types of irregularities at the grain level of the microstructure that are responsible for the hardness of the material. These irregularities are point defects and line defects. A point defect is an irregularity located at a single lattice site inside of the overall three-dimensional lattice of the grain. There are three main point defects. If there is an atom missing from the array, a [[vacancy defect]] is formed. If there is a different type of atom at the lattice site that should normally be occupied by a metal atom, a substitutional defect is formed. If there exists an atom in a site where there should normally not be, an [[interstitial defect]] is formed. This is possible because space exists between atoms in a crystal lattice. While point defects are irregularities at a single site in the crystal lattice, line defects are irregularities on a plane of atoms. [[Dislocations]] are a type of line defect involving the misalignment of these planes. In the case of an edge dislocation, a half plane of atoms is wedged between two planes of atoms. In the case of a screw dislocation two planes of atoms are offset with a helical array running between them.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel, J. (2009). ''Introduction to materials science course manual''. Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin-Madison.&lt;/ref&gt;

In glasses, hardness seems to depend linearly on the number of topological constraints acting between the atoms of the network.&lt;ref name=mauro2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smedskjaer|first=Morten M.|author2=John C. Mauro |author3=Yuanzheng Yue |title=Prediction of Glass Hardness Using Temperature-Dependent Constraint Theory|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|year=2010|volume=105|issue=11|page=2010|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.115503|pmid=20867584|bibcode=2010PhRvL.105k5503S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the [[Rigidity theory (physics)|rigidity theory]] has allowed predicting hardness values with respect to composition.

[[Image:Dislocation edge d2.jpg|thumb|right|Planes of atoms split by an edge dislocation.]]

Dislocations provide a mechanism for planes of atoms to slip and thus a method for plastic or permanent deformation.&lt;ref name="Haasen" /&gt;  Planes of atoms can flip from one side of the dislocation to the other effectively allowing the dislocation to traverse through the material and the material to deform permanently. The movement allowed by these dislocations causes a decrease in the material's hardness.

The way to inhibit the movement of planes of atoms, and thus make them harder, involves the interaction of dislocations with each other and interstitial atoms. When a dislocation intersects with a second dislocation, it can no longer traverse through the crystal lattice. The intersection of dislocations creates an anchor point and does not allow the planes of atoms to continue to slip over one another&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, W. C. (1981). The physical metallurgy of steels. Washington: Hempisphere Pub. Corp., New York: McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0070377804}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A dislocation can also be anchored by the interaction with interstitial atoms. If a dislocation comes in contact with two or more interstitial atoms, the slip of the planes will again be disrupted. The interstitial atoms create anchor points, or pinning points, in the same manner as intersecting dislocations.

By varying the presence of interstitial atoms and the density of dislocations, a particular metal's hardness can be controlled. Although seemingly counter-intuitive, as the density of dislocations increases, there are more intersections created and consequently more anchor points. Similarly, as more interstitial atoms are added, more pinning points that impede the movements of dislocations are formed. As a result, the more anchor points added, the harder the material will become.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3695">The '''International Biological Program''' ('''IBP''') was an effort between 1964 and 1974 to coordinate large-scale ecological and environmental studies.  Organized in the wake of the successful [[International Geophysical Year]] (IGY) of 1957-1958, the International Biological Program was an attempt to apply the methods of [[big science]] to [[ecosystem ecology]] and pressing environmental issues.

The IBP was organized under the leadership of [[C. H. Waddington]] beginning in 1962 and officially started in 1964, with the goal of exploring "The Biological Basis of Productivity and Human Welfare".  In its early years, Canadian and European ecologists were the main participants; by 1968, the United States also became heavily involved.  However, unlike other more successful applications of the big science model of scientific research, the IBP lacked a clear, socially  and scientifically pressing goal.  Many biologists, particularly [[molecular biology|molecular biologists]] and [[evolutionary ecology|evolutionary ecologists]], were sharply critical of the IBP, which they viewed as throwing money at ill-defined or relatively unimportant problems and reducing the freedom of scientists to choose their own research projects.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, ''An Entangled Bank'', pp. 164-172&lt;/ref&gt;

The main results of the IBP were five [[biome]] studies, the largest of which were the [[Grassland Biome]] project and the [[Eastern Deciduous Forest Biome]] project (both of which had ties to [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], which provided [[isotopic tracer|tracer isotopes]] for nutrient- and energy-flow experiments).  Though the impact of these studies was modest, the IBP marked a dramatic increase in the scale of funding for ecosystem ecology, which remained high (relative to earlier levels) even after the conclusion of the program in June 1974.  Far more influential than any of the IBP biome studies was contemporary [[Hubbard Brook]] ecosystem study of 1963-1968, which&amp;mdash;lacking the hierarchical organization of IBP projects&amp;mdash;grew gradually according to individual scientists' interest and involved more informal collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, ''An Entangled Bank'', pp. 175-186&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most influential IBP projects in Europe was the [[Solling Project]] in [[Lower Saxony]] (Germany), led by [[Heinz Ellenberg]]. Evidence from here proved decisive in the 1980s to track down [[Acid Rain]] as major cause of [[Forest Decline]]. 

In tropical areas, the LAMTO project held by French professor [[Maxime Lamotte]] in Ivory Coast provided a thorough analysis of the savannah energy budget and a profound knowledge of almost all biodiversity present in this savannah.

'''Johann Reinhold Forster''' (22 October 1729 – 9 December 1798) was a [[Continental Reformed church|Reformed (Calvinist)]] pastor&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Dove, Alfred. "Forster, Johann Reinhold" in ''Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie'', v.7 (1878), [http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/pnd118534432.html?anchor=adb pp. 166–172.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Karl Ludwig Preuß: ''Dirschau's historische Denkwürdigkeiten.

''Kafemann, Danzig 1860, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nvoAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA39 pp. 39–44.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[natural history|naturalist]] of partially Scottish descent who made contributions to the early [[ornithology]] of Europe and North America. He is best known as the naturalist on [[James Cook]]'s second [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] voyage, where he was accompanied by his son [[Georg Forster]]. These expeditions promoted the career of Johann Reinhold Forster and the findings became the bedrock of colonial professionalism and helped set the stage for the future development of anthropology and ethnology. They also laid the framework for general concern about the impact that alteration of the physical environment for European economic expansion would have on exotic societies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Grove]], Green Imperialism: Colonial Expansion, Tropical Island Edens and the Origins of Environmentalism, 1600–1860 (Cambridge University Press, 1995), pp 309–375.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[Image:Forsterundsohn.jpg|left|thumb|Johann Reinhold Forster and [[Georg Forster]] in [[Tahiti]], by [[John Francis Rigaud]] (1742–1810), 1780.]]
Forster's family originated in the [[Lord Forrester|Lords Forrester]] in Scotland from where his great-grandfather had emigrated after losing most of his property during the rule of [[Oliver Cromwell]] along with many other Scots. Forster himself was born in the city of [[Tczew]] (Dirschau), in the province of [[Royal Prussia]], in the [[Crown of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Dzieje nauki polskiej|last= Iłowiecki|first= Maciej|authorlink= |author2= |year= 1981|publisher= Wydawnictwo Interpress|location= Warszawa|isbn= 83-223-1876-6|page= 140|pages= |url= |accessdate=|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied languages and natural history at the Joachimsthal Gymnasium in Berlin, theology at the [[University of Halle]], afterwards serving as a Protestant pastor in [[Mokry Dwór, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Mokry Dwór]] (Nassenhuben) [[Pomeranian Voivodship]]. He married his cousin Elisabeth Nikolai. They had several children including a son, [[Georg Forster]] and a daughter   [[Virginia Viktoria Foster|Virginia Viktoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/hi/gnt/dsi2/index.php?table_name=dsi&amp;function=details&amp;where_field=id&amp;where_value=4141|title=Foster, Virginia Viktoria|last=|first=|date=|website=www.uni-stuttgart.de|publisher=Stuttgart Database of Scientific Illustrators, University of Stuttgart.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1765 he accepted an offer made to him by the Russian government to inspect and report upon the new colonies founded on the banks of the [[Volga]], in the province of [[Saratov]].&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Forster, Johann Georg Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt; His irritable temper soon involved him in difficulties with the Russian government, and in the following year he went with Georg (the eldest of eight children, seven of which survived childhood) to England and became teacher of natural history at [[Warrington]], Lancashire.&lt;ref name=nie&gt;{{NIE|wstitle=Forster, Johann Reinhold|year=1906|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent three years teaching at the Dissenting [[Warrington Academy]], succeeding [[Joseph Priestley]]. Compelled by his violent temper to resign this appointment, Forster then moved with his son to London, where they earned a precarious living by doing translations.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; In 1771, he published ''A Catalogue of the Animals of North America'',&lt;ref&gt;Forster, Johann R. 1771. ''A catalogue of the animals of North America. 'containing, an enumeration of the known quadrupeds, birds, reptiles, fish, insects, crustaceous and testaceous animals; many of which are new, and never described before, to which is added, short directions for collecting, preserving, and transporting, all kinds of natural history curiosities.'' B. White, London, England. 43 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; which listed the region's mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, insects, arachnids, and crustaceans.&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, John V. 2010. An overlooked 18th century list of North American Lepidoptera. News of the Lepidopterists' Society 52:3–5, 16–20, 25. http://images.peabody.yale.edu/lepsoc/nls/2010s/2010/2010_v52_n1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Joseph Banks]] withdrew at the last moment as naturalist on Cook's second voyage, Forster and his son were appointed to fill the vacant position. In July 1772 they set sail on the ''[[HMS Resolution (Cook)|Resolution]]'', returning to England in July 1775. During a stop in [[Cape Town]], Forster engaged [[Anders Sparrman]] to act as his assistant.

Both the Forsters kept detailed diaries of everything they saw on the voyage, and made extensive collections of both natural history specimens and artefacts. On his return Forster published ''Observations Made during a Voyage round the World'' (1778).&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Forster (1778){{Google books|VI8-AQAAIAAJ|Observations made during a Voyage round the World}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the income from the book was insufficient to clear his debts, and the bulk of Georg's drawings from the voyage had to be sold to Joseph Banks. During the next few years Forster undertook a variety of writing work, including a German translation of [[Thomas Pennant]]'s ''Arctic Zoology''.

In November 1779 Forster was appointed Professor of [[Natural history]] and [[Mineralogy]] at the [[University of Halle]], and director of the [[Botanische Garten der Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg]], where he remained until his death. His ''Descriptiones animalium'', completed within a month of returning to England with Cook, was eventually edited by [[Hinrich Lichtenstein]] and published in 1844.

Forster's contributions to the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'' (1772–73) on zoology, ornithology, and ichthyology established him as one of the earliest authorities on North American zoology.

There are 37 [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs) in [[Tyne and Wear]], [[England]]. In England, the body responsible for designating SSSIs is [[Natural England]], which chooses sites because of their [[plant|flora]], [[fauna]], [[geology|geological]] or physiographical features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Notification of SSSIs | work=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm | accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural England took over the role of designating and managing SSSIs from [[English Nature]] in October 2006 when it was formed from the amalgamation of English Nature, parts of the [[Countryside Agency]] and the [[Rural Development Service]]. Natural England, like its predecessor, uses the [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|1974–1996 county system]] with each area being called an [[Area of Search]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/special/sssi/glossary.cfm|title=Glossary of SSSI terms|publisher=Natural England|date=2007|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tyne and Wear]] is made up of five administrative local authorities consisting mainly of the two largest cities in the region: [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] and [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], thus making it the [[List of conurbations in the United Kingdom|sixth largest conurbation]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Tyne and Wear shares its borders with [[Northumberland]] and [[County Durham]], to the north and south respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tyne-wear-research.gov.uk/core.nsf/a/twri_special_reports_profile_2004|title=Tyne and Wear Profile: 2004|publisher=Tyne &amp; Wear Research|date=2004|accessdate=2008-06-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527203241/http://www.tyne-wear-research.gov.uk/core.nsf/a/twri_special_reports_profile_2004|archivedate=2008-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2026">'''Mythological mountains''' are an important motif in [[Chinese mythology]], and related mythologies. Some  mountains are more mythological than others, with some only having conjectural relations to real mountains. In some cases historical records indicate that explorers named newly charted mountains after mythological mountains; thus, sometimes real mountains were named after mythological mountains: for example, the identification of Kunlun kept moving west (when it was not stated to be in the south). In other cases, the mountains seem real enough, but a mythological or fictional layer or layers have been added to their description: for example, the stories told about the [[Flaming Mountains#Mythology|Flaming Mountains]]. Due to features of the Chinese vocabulary, syntax, and resulting translations, it is not clear whether a given "mountain" is one mountain, a mountain range, or merely a significant hill, though mythological exaggeration occurs: for example, some mountains are said to reach up into Heaven. Mountains or mythological mountains significantly related to Chinese and related mythology include:

* [[Eight Pillars]]:eight mountains holding the Earth and Heaven apart
* [[Feather Mountain]]: a place of exile during or just after the [[Great Flood (China)|world flood]], and other events
* [[Flaming Mountains#Mythology|Flaming Mountains]]: located in the [[Tian Shan]] range, of Central Asia. Subject of Chinese stories and Uyghur mythology 
* [[Jade Mountain (mythology)|Jade Mountain]]: in some accounts the dwelling of [[Xiwangmu]], Queen Mother of the West
* [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun Mountain]]: a mythical mountain, dwelling of various divinities, and fabulous plants and animals
* [[Mount Buzhou]]: mythological mountain, one of the Pillars holding the Earth and Sky apart, damaged by [[Gong Gong]]
* [[Mount Penglai]]: paradise; a fabled fairy isle on the China Sea

This is a list of all the commercial [[nuclear reactor]]s in the world, sorted by country, with operational status. 
The list only includes civilian [[nuclear power]] reactors used to generate electricity for a [[power grid]].
All commercial nuclear reactors use [[nuclear fission]].
As of April 2018, there are 449 operable reactors in the world, with a combined electrical capacity of 394 GW. 
Additionally, there are 58 reactors under construction and 154 reactors planned, with a combined capacity of 63 GW and 157 GW, respectively.&lt;ref name=WNA&gt;{{cite web|title=World Nuclear Power Reactors {{!}} Uranium Requirements {{!}} Future Nuclear Power - World Nuclear Association|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/world-nuclear-power-reactors-and-uranium-requireme.aspx|website=www.world-nuclear.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Over 300 more reactors are proposed.&lt;ref name=WNA/&gt;

As of 8 December 2014, the [[National Council (Switzerland)|Swiss parliament]] has voted to limit the operational life-time of Beznau I &amp; II to no more than 60 years, and to enshrine a ban of constructing new reactors in the Constitution. However, this decision still has to pass the [[Council of States (Switzerland)|Council of States]] and it is likely that a [[referendum]] will be taken against such amendment. In addition, an [[Initiative]] of limiting the life-span of all nuclear reactors to 45 years will have to be voted upon the Swiss, irrespective of whether the legislature will actually enforce the constitutional amendment or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzz.ch/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024225347/http://www.nzz.ch/ |archivedate=24 October 2012 |df=dmy}}, Neue Zürcher Zeitung, [{{cite web|url=http://www.nzz.ch/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024225347/http://www.nzz.ch/ |archivedate=24 October 2012 |df=dmy}}schweiz/nationalrat-will-beznau-nach-60-jahren-vom-netz-nehmen-1.18440712 Nationalrat will Beznau nach 60 Jahren vom Netz nehmen (in German)], 8 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''list of threatened fauna of Michigan''' includes almost 400 [[endangered species|endangered]], [[threatened species|threatened]] and special concern species that are located in [[Michigan]] as a part of the [[fauna of the United States]].&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10370_12141-213610--,00.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions: The 2009 Revision of the State Endangered Species List|publisher=Michigan Department of Natural Resources|accessdate=2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Endangered and threatened species in Michigan are protected through the [[Endangered Species Act#State endangered species lists|Endangered Species Act of the State of Michigan]], part of the 1994 Michigan Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act. The list was last updated in 2009 to its sixth iteration.&lt;ref name=MSU/&gt; At this time, 69 new species were added, including many species of [[freshwater mussel]]s and [[snail]]s, and 13 species were removed.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; The state also recognizes species of special concern, which are not protected under the Act. These species have low or declining numbers in the state or a need for additional information on their populations in Michigan. If the species' numbers decline, they are moved to threatened or endangered status and afforded protection under the Act; if they increase, they are removed from the list without further action.&lt;ref name=MSU&gt;{{cite web |title= Michigan's Special Animals |url= http://mnfi.anr.msu.edu/data/specialanimals.cfm#grp16 |publisher= Michigan State University |accessdate=2012-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Threatened and endangered species can also be listed under the Federal [[Endangered Species Act]], passed in 1973; the Act covers over 1,250 plant and animal species. Species can be on either list or both lists – representation on one does not automatically determine representation (or status) on the other.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fed&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/lists/pdf/MichiganStateList.pdf|title=Federally Endangered, Threatened, Proposed and Candidate Species in Michigan|publisher=US Fish and Wildlife Service|accessdate=2012-07-29|date=February 2012|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A large portion of the field surveys and research conducted with regards to threatened and endangered species in Michigan is undertaken by the Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) program. The MNFI program was originally developed in 1980 as part of the state [[natural heritage]] programs conceptualized by [[The Nature Conservancy]] (TNC), through which it received its first funding. The MNFI program severed relations with TNC in 2000, and became a program of the [[Michigan State University]] Extension Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10370_12141-32952--,00.html|title=A Partner in Resource Protection|publisher=Michigan Department of Natural Resources|accessdate=2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mammals==
There are twelve species of threatened [[mammal]]s in Michigan. Five of these are listed as species of threatened concern, three as threatened and four as endangered. Two also have federal listed status as endangered or threatened.

This list compiles many of the common large [[shrub]]s and [[tree]]s found in [[Canada]]. The Canadian flora is depauperate because of the near total glaciation event in the Pleistocene. Due to the vast area of Canada, a tree that is common in one area may be completely absent in another. In particular, many warm-temperate trees can only be grown on the mild [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast (where gardens may contain additional species not listed here).

'''Materials for use in vacuum''' are materials showing very low rate of [[outgassing]] in [[vacuum]], and, where applicable, tolerant to the [[bake-out]] temperatures. The requirements grow increasingly stringent with the desired degree of vacuum achievable in the [[vacuum chamber]].
The materials can produce gas by several mechanisms. Molecules of gases and water can be [[adsorption|adsorbed]] on the material surface (therefore materials with low affinity to water have to be chosen, which eliminates many plastics). Materials may [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimate]] in vacuum (this includes some metals and their alloys, most notably cadmium and zinc). Or the gases can be released from [[porosity|porous]] materials or from cracks and crevices. Traces of lubricants, residues from machining, can be present on the surfaces. A specific risk is outgassing of solvents absorbed in plastics after cleaning.

The gases liberated from the materials not only lower the vacuum quality, but also can be reabsorbed on other surfaces, creating deposits and contaminating the chamber.

Yet another problem is diffusion of gases through the materials themselves. Atmospheric [[helium]] can diffuse even through [[Pyrex]] glass, even if slowly; this however is usually not an issue. Some materials might also expand or increase in size causing problems in delicate equipment.

In addition to the gas-related issues, the materials have to maintain adequate strength through the entire required temperature range (sometimes reaching [[cryogenic]] temperatures), maintain their properties (elasticity, plasticity, electrical and thermal conductivity or lack of it, etc.), be machinable, and if possible not be overly expensive. Yet another concern is the [[thermal expansion coefficient]] match of adjacent parts.

==Materials to avoid==
Materials outgas by three mechanisms: release of [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;gases (de[[Sorption|sorption]] from the bulk of the material), release of [[Adsorption|adsorbed]] gases ([[Desorption|desorption]] from the surface only), and evaporation of the material itself. The former can be reduced by a bakeout, the latter is an intrinsic property of the material.&lt;ref name="vacphytec"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vacuum Physics and Technology|author=Meurant, G.|date=1980|publisher=[[Elsevier Science]]|isbn=9780080859958|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tfLWfAx1ZWQC&amp;pg=PA346|page=346|accessdate=2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some outgassed materials can deposit on other surfaces, contaminate the vacuum system and be difficult to get rid of.

The most common sources of trouble (out-gassing) in vacuum systems are:
* [[Cadmium]], often present in the form of [[cadmium plating]], or in some [[soldering]] and [[brazing]] alloys
* [[Zinc]], problematic for high vacuum and higher temperatures, present in some construction alloys, e.g. [[brass]] and some brazing alloys. Tends to poison [[hot cathode]]s and form conductive deposits on surfaces.&lt;ref name="fermi"/&gt;  Any materials that have been zinc-coated by [[galvanization]] should be avoided, or they have the coating removed first.
* [[Magnesium]]
* [[PVC]], usually in the form of [[wire]] insulation (source of virtual leaks too)
* [[Paint]]s
* [[Lead]] and [[antimony]] used in some soft [[solder]]s and outgassing at higher temperatures&lt;ref name="fermi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lss.fnal.gov/archive/tm/TM-1615.pdf|publisher=[[Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]]|title= TM-1615: Materials for Ultra-High Vacuum|author= G. Lee | date=August 15, 1989 |accessdate=2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many [[plastics]], namely many plastic tapes (special attention should be paid to adhesives). Fiberglass composites, e.g. [[Micarta]] (G-10) and G-30, should be avoided. Even [[Kapton]] and [[Teflon]] are sometimes advised against.&lt;ref name="fermi"/&gt;
* Various residues, e.g. [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] from soldering and brazing, and lubricants from machining making thorough cleaning imperative. Getting the outgassable residues from tight crevices can be challenging; a good mechanical design that avoids such features can help.

==Materials for vacuum use==

===Metals===
* [[Austenitic stainless steel]]s are the most common choice for [[Vacuum|high vacuum]] and [[ultra-high vacuum]] systems. Not all alloys are suitable; e.g. the free-machining 303 steel contains [[sulfur]], which tends to outgas. Alloys with good weldability under argon [[arc welding]] are usually chosen.
** '''304 [[Stainless steel#Comparison of standardized steels|stainless steel]]''' is a common choice of a stainless steel.
** '''304L [[Stainless steel#Comparison of standardized steels|stainless steel]]''', a low-carbon variant of 304 steel, is used for ultra-high vacuum systems.
** '''316L [[Stainless steel#Comparison of standardized steels|stainless steel]]''' a low-carbon and low-magnetic stainless steel, used in accelerator technologies.
** '''347 [[Stainless steel#Comparison of standardized steels|stainless steel]]''' does not accept high polish.
** '''321 [[Stainless steel#Comparison of standardized steels|stainless steel]]''' is chosen when low [[magnetic permeability]] is needed.
* [[Mild steel]] can be used for moderate vacuums above 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; torr. Outgassing can be lowered with suitable (e.g. nickel) [[plating]]. It has high permeability to hydrogen and tendency to rust. For use it should be thoroughly outgassed in vacuum.
* [[Aluminium]] and [[aluminium alloys]] are another class of frequently used materials. They are well-machinable and have low outgassing, unless the alloys contain higher proportions of [[zinc]]. The parts must not be [[anodized]], as the oxide layer traps (and outgases) water vapor. Anodizing also makes the surface non-conducting, so that its surface will charge up in [[electrostatic system]]s. The best treatment is Alochroming, which seals the surface, makes it hard and conductive. Its outgassing rate is considerably less than non-treated aluminium. Aluminium and its alloys have low strength at high temperatures, distort when being welded, and the copper-containing ones are poorly weldable. Aluminium wire rings can be used as cheap gaskets in demountable seals. Aluminium has high thermal conductivity, good corrosion resistance, and low solubility of hydrogen. Loss of strength at high temperatures limits its use in bakeable applications, but aluminium is advantageous for large-size systems due to its lower weight and lower cost than stainless steel. Use of aluminium is limited by difficulties in its welding and brazing. It can be used for x-ray windows.&lt;ref name="vacphytec"/&gt;
* [[Aluminium bronze]] is a material that looks and machines similar to [[brass]]. It is not susceptible to [[galling]], which makes it suitable for sliding fits against stainless steel.
* [[Nickel]] is widely used in vacuum technology, e.g. as mechanical parts in [[vacuum tube]]s. It is relatively low-cost, can be spot welded, can be easily machined, has high melting point and is resistant to many corrosive fluids and atmospheres. Its potential drawback is its [[ferromagnetism]], which restricts applications that would be influenced by magnetic fields.&lt;ref name="vacphytec"/&gt;
* Nickel alloys, e.g. [[cupronickel]]&lt;ref name="fermi"/&gt;
* [[Beryllium]] is used primarily for x-ray windows.
* [[Oxygen-free copper]] is widely used. It is easily machined and has good corrosion resistance. It is unsuitable for bakeable vacuum envelopes due to its tendency to oxidize and create scales. Copper rings are used in demountable seals. Normal [[copper]] is unsuitable for high vacuum as it is difficult to outgas completely. Copper is insensitive to hydrogen and impermeable to hydrogen and helium, has low sensitivity to water vapor, but is attacked by mercury. Its strength falls sharply above 200&amp;nbsp;°C. Its vapor pressure becomes significant at above 500&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="vacphytec"/&gt;
* [[Brass]] is suitable for some applications. It has good corrosion resistance. Its zinc content may cause problems; zinc outgassing can be reduced by nickel-plating.
* [[Indium]] wire is used as a gasket in demountable seals.
* [[Gold]] wire is used as a gasket in demountable seals for ultra-high vacuum, as well as an alternative to lead-tin solder for making electrical connections.
* [[Platinum]] is a highly chemically inert material with high cost and low outgassing.
* [[Zirconium]] is corrosion-resistant. It has low production of [[secondary electrons]], so it is used as a coating of areas where reducing their production is important. It is used for [[neutron]] windows. It is costly and scarce, its uses are therefore limited. Zirconium and zirconium hydride are used for [[gettering]].
* [[Tungsten]] is often used in high temperature applications as well as for filaments in electron/ion optics. It becomes brittle from [[work hardening]] when mechanically deformed, or subjected to very high temperatures.
* [[Molybdenum]] and [[tantalum]] are useful for high temperature applications.&lt;ref name="fermi"/&gt;
* [[Titanium]] and [[niobium]] are good materials.
* [[Solder]]s are sometimes unavoidable for soft-soldered joints. Tin-lead solders (Sn50Pb50, Sn60Pb40, Sn63Pb37) can be conditionally used when the apparatus is not to be baked and operating temperatures aren't elevated (lead tends to outgas). A better choice for vacuum systems is the tin-silver eutectic, Sn95Ag5; its melting point of 230&amp;nbsp;°C allows bakeout up to 200&amp;nbsp;°C. A similar 95-5 alloy, Sn95Sb5, is unsuitable as antimony has similar vapor pressure as lead. Take care to remove [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] residues.
* [[List of brazing alloys|Brazing alloys]] are used for joining materials by [[brazing]]. Care has to be taken while choosing the alloys, as some elements tend to outgas. Cadmium and zinc are the worst common offenders. Silver, a common component of brazing alloys, can be problematic at higher temperatures and lower pressures. A silver-copper eutectic, named e.g. Cusil, is recommended. A superior alternative is a copper-silver-tin alloy called Cusiltin. Copper-silver-phosphorus alloys, e.g. Sil-Fos, are also suitable.&lt;ref name="fermi"/&gt;

===Plastics===
* Some [[fluoropolymer]]s, e.g. [[polyvinylidene fluoride]], are suitable for use in vacuum. They have low outgassing and are tolerant to higher temperatures.
** [[Polytetrafluoroethylene]] ([[PTFE]] or Teflon) is commonly used inside of vacuum systems. It is self-lubricating, a good electrical insulator, tolerant to fairly high temperatures, and has low out-gassing. It is not suitable for barrier between vacuum and atmosphere, as it is somewhat permeable for gases. Ceramics is a superior choice, however.&lt;ref name="fermi"/&gt;
* [[Polyethylene]] is usable but requires thorough out-gassing. [[Nalgene]] can be used as a cheaper alternative for [[Bell jar]]s.
* [[Vespel]] [[polyimide]] is very expensive, but machines well, has good electrical insulator properties and is compatible with ultra-high vacuum.
* [[PVC]], despite its high outgassing rate, can be used in limited applications for rough vacuum lines.
* [[Nylon]] is self-lubricating but has high outgassing rate and high affinity to water.
* [[Acrylate polymer|Acrylics]] have high outgassing rate and high affinity to water.
* [[Polycarbonate]]s and [[polystyrene]] are good electrical insulators with moderate outgassing.
* [[PEEK]] (PolyEtherEtherKetone) has relatively low out-gassing values (0.31% TML, 0.00% CVCM, 0.06% WVR).
* [[Kapton]] is a type of polyimide film, has very low outgassing. Kapton is discouraged if a ceramic alternative can be used.&lt;ref name="fermi"/&gt;
* Some [[elastomer]]s have sufficient vacuum properties to be employed in vacuum o-rings:
** [[Nitrile rubber|NBRs]], ([[Nitrile rubber]]), commonly used for demountable vacuum seals (bakeable only up to 100&amp;nbsp;°C).
** [[FKM|FKMs (FPMs)]], ([[Viton]]) is used for demountable vacuum seals. It is better for lower pressures than [[nitrile rubber]] and chemically much more [[Chemically inert|inert]]. It is bakeable to 200&amp;nbsp;°C.
** [[FFKM]]s ([[FFPM]]s) very low out-gassing similar to Teflon and withstands baking temperatures up to 300&amp;nbsp;°C, while chemically one of the most [[Chemically inert|inert]] sealing elastomers.

===Glasses and ceramics===
* [[Borosilicate glass]] is often used for smaller assemblies and for viewports. It can be machined and joined well. Glasses can be [[glass-to-metal seal|joined with metals]].
* [[Porcelain]] and [[alumina]] ceramics, when fully [[vitrified]] and therefore non-porous, are excellent insulators usable up to 1500&amp;nbsp;°C. Some ceramics can be machined. Ceramics can be [[ceramics-to-metal seal|joined with metals]].
* [[Macor]] is a machinable ceramic that is an excellent alternative to alumina, as the firing process of alumina can change the dimensions and tolerances.

===Lubricants===
Lubrication of moving parts is a problem for vacuum. Many [[lubricant]]s have unacceptable outgassing rates,&lt;ref name="Carre, Bertrand, 1999" &gt;{{Cite journal

* [[Vacuum grease]]s are [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]]s with low outgassing.
** [[Ramsay grease]] is an old composition of paraffin wax, vaseline and natural rubber, usable up to about 25&amp;nbsp;°C, for low vacuums to about 1 Pa.

* [[Dry lubricant]]s, can be incorporated in plastics as fillers, as a component of sintered metals, or deposited on metal, ceramic and plastic surfaces.

===Adhesives===
* Torr-Seal, or its generic equivalent Hysol-1C (USA brand name) or Loctite 9492 (EU brand name), is an epoxy with resin and hardener for use in vacuum environments. It will begin to degrade at high temperatures but otherwise is very stable with very little outgassing. Other vacuum-rated epoxies are also available. For mounting or joining thin metal foils, grids, or other small pieces that are not expected to undergo stress, silver or gold paste may be used as an adhesive. After fixing the material(s) with silver paste, the piece must be   baked (to &gt; 200 C) in air for &gt; 24 hours to remove volatiles prior to insertion into vacuum. 

==Materials for use in space==
In addition to the concerns above, materials for use in [[spacecraft]] applications have to cope with [[radiation damage]] and high-intensity [[ultraviolet radiation]], thermal loads from solar radiation, radiation cooling of the vehicle in other directions, and heat produced within the spacecraft's systems. Another concern, for orbits closer to Earth, is the presence of [[atomic oxygen]], leading to [[corrosion in space|corrosion]] of exposed surfaces; aluminium is an especially sensitive material{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}. Silver, often used for surface-deposited interconnects, forms layer of silver oxide that flakes off and may erode up to a total failure.

Corrosion-sensitive surfaces can be protected by a suitable [[plating]], most often with [[gold]]; a [[silica]] layer is also possible. However the coating layer is subject to erosion by [[micrometeoroids]].

 [[File:Ararat Ms. 11639 521a.jpg|thumb|300px|Depiction of Noah's ark landing on the  mountain top, from the [[North French Hebrew Miscellany]] (13th century)]]

'''Mount Judi''' ({{lang-ar|الجوديّ}} ''{{transl|ar|al-Ǧūdiyy}}'', {{lang-arc|קרדו}} ''{{transl|arc|Qardū}}'',&lt;ref name=encyclo-quran&gt;{{cite book|last=McAuliffe|first=Jane Dammen|title=Encyclopaedia Of The Quran, Volume 1|year=2001|publisher=Brill Academic Pub|isbn=978-90-04-11465-4|pages=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ku|Cûdî}}, {{lang-syc|ܩܪܕܘ}} ''{{transl|syc|Qardū}}'',&lt;ref name=encyclo-quran/&gt; {{lang-tr|Cudi}}), also spelled Guti and Kutu, according to very Early Christian and [[Islamic view of Noah|Islamic]] tradition (based on the [[Qur'an]], [[sura 11|Hud]]:44), is [[Noah]]'s '''''apobaterion''''' or "Place of Descent", the location where the [[Noah's Ark|Ark]] came to rest after the [[Great Flood (Biblical)|Great Flood]].

The Quranic tradition is similar to the Judeo-Christian legend. The identification of Mount Judi as the landing site of the ark persisted in Syriac and Armenian tradition throughout [[Late Antiquity]] but was abandoned for the tradition equating the biblical location with the highest mountain of the region, [[Mount Ararat]].

[[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic|Jewish Babylonian]], Syriac, and Islamic traditions identify Mount Judi or Qardu as a peak near the town of [[Jazirat ibn Umar]] (modern Cizre), at the headwaters of the [[Tigris]], near the modern Syrian–Turkish border. [[Arab historian]] [[Al-Masudi]] (d. 956), reported that the spot where the ark came to rest could be seen in his time. Al-Masudi locates Jabal Judi at 80 [[parasang]]s from the Tigris.

Mount Judi was historically located in the province of [[Corduene]], south of Lake Van.

==Name==
The relation of some of the spellings is clear.
The origin of ''Judi'' is less clear. It is usually interpreted as a corrupted version of the same name, via ''al-gurdi'' (Reynolds 2004).
The proposal that the two names are ultimately the same was first advanced by the English Orientalist [[George Sale]] in his translation of the Qur'an published in 1734. Sale's footnote reads:

: This mountain [al-Judi] is one of those that divide [[Armenian Highland|Armenia]] on the south, from [[Mesopotamia]], and that part of [[Assyria]] which is inhabited by the Curds, from whom the mountains took the name Cardu, or Gardu, by the [[Greece|Greeks]] turned into Gordyae, and other names. ... Mount Al-Judi (which seems to be a corruption, though it be constantly so written by the Arabs, for Jordi, or Giordi) is also called Thamanin ..., probably from a town at the foot of it. 

Sale goes on to say that there was once a famous Christian [[monastery]] on the mountain, but that this was destroyed by lightning in the year 776 AD, following which
: the credit of this tradition hath declined, and given place to another, which obtains at present, and according to which the ark rested on [[Mount Masis]], in Armenia, called by the Turks Agri Dagh.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Christian tradition==
{{See|Mountains of Ararat}}

The [[Roman Syria|Syrians]] of the east Tigris had a legend of the ark resting on the ''Djûdi'' mountain in the land of [[Corduene]] (''Kard'', ''Korchayk'', ''Carduchoi''). This legend may in origin have been independent of the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] account of [[Noah's flood]], rooted in the more general [[Near Eastern flood legends]], but following Christianization of the Syrians,  from about the 2nd century AD, it became associated with the [[Mountains of Ararat]] where Noah landed according to Genesis, and from Syria also this legend also spread to the [[Roman Armenia|Armenians]]. The Armenians did not traditionally associate Noah's landing site with [[Mount Ararat]], known natively as ''Masis'', but until the 11th century continued to associate Noah's ark with Mount Judi.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare]],  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3152410?seq=2&amp;Search=yes&amp;term=Ararat&amp;term=Eusebius&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3DEusebius%2BArarat%26wc%3Don%26dc%3DAll%2BDisciplines&amp;item=1&amp;ttl=35&amp;returnArticleService=showArticle&amp;resultsServiceName=doBasicResultsFromArticle review] of Friedrich Murat, ''Ararat und Masis, Studien zur armenischen Altertumskunde und Litteratur'', Heidelberg, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is to be noted, the biblical ''Ararat'' is thought be a variation of ''[[Urartu]]'', an ancient term for the region north of ancient [[Assyria]] which encompasses the [[Armenian plateau]]. 

According to [[Josephus]], the Armenians in the 1st century showed the remains of Noah's ark at a place called αποβατηριον "Place of Descent" ({{lang-hy|Նախիջեւան}}, ''Nakhichevan'', [[Ptolemy]]'s Ναξουανα), about 60 miles southeast of the summit of [[Mount Ararat]] (ca. {{Coord| 39.07|45.08|display=inline}}).&lt;ref&gt;Conybeare (1901)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The "mountains of Ararat" in Genesis have become identified in later (medieval) Christian tradition with the peak now known as [[Mount Ararat]] itself, a volcanic massif on the border between Turkey and Armenia and known in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] as "Agri Dagh" (Ağrı Dağı).

==Islamic tradition==
{{See also|Noah in Islam}}

The Quranic account of the [[Deluge (mythology)|Flood]] and Noah's Ark agrees with that given in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], with a few variations. One of these concerns the final resting place of the Ark: according to Genesis, the Ark grounded on the "[[mountains of Ararat]]". According to ''Surah'' 11:44 of the Qur'an, the final resting place of the vessel was called "Judi", without the word "mountain". However, the use of Arabic definite letter "Al" in front of word Judi in the Quran signifies that it is pointing to a definite place (or mountain, in this case). Has it been referring to a general height, it would have been just "Judi", not "Al-Judi". §&lt;ref&gt;[[Arabic definite article]]&lt;/ref&gt;

: And the word was spoken: "O earth! swallow up thy waters! And, O sky, cease [thy rain]!" And the water sank into the earth, and the will [of God] was done, and the ark came to rest on Al-Judi. And the word was spoken: "Away with these evil doing folk!" (Quran, 11:44).

The 9th century [[Arab]] geographer Ibn Khordadbih identified the location of mount Judi as being in the land of [[Assyria]] (''Al-Akrad''), and the [[Abbasid]] historian [[Abu al-Hasan 'Alī al-Mas'ūdī]] (c. 896-956) recorded that the spot where it came to rest could be seen in his time. Masudi also said that the Ark began its voyage at [[Kufa]] in central [[Iraq]], and sailed to [[Mecca]], where it circled the [[Kaaba]], before finally travelling to Judi. Yaqut al-Hamawi, also known as Al-Rumi, placed the mountain "above Jazirat ibn Umar, to the east of the Tigris" and mentioned a [[mosque]] built by Noah that could be seen in his day, and the traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] passed by the mountain in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Lewis, ''Noah and the Flood: In Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Tradition'', The Biblical Archaeologist, December 1984, p.237&lt;/ref&gt;

==Searches for Mount Judi==

In the 1980s, adventurer and self-styled archaeologist [[Ron Wyatt]] and his colleague [[David Fasold]] claimed to have discovered Noah's Ark at [[Durupınar site|Durupınar]], some twenty miles from Mt. Ararat near a mountain locals called ''Cudi Dağı''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Fasold  | first = David  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Ark of Noah  | publisher = Wynwood  | year = 1988  | location = New York  | pages = 92–93  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 0-922066-10-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fasold later vacillated on the claim.&lt;ref name= Clifton&gt;{{Cite news | last = Clifton | first = Brad | title =  Doubts sank faith in Ark| newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]]  | date = 9 April 1997 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Thomson&gt;{{Cite news | last = Thomson| first =Kirstyn | title =  Witness Tells How Ark Faith Sank| newspaper = The West Australian | date = 9 April 1997 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Deal | first = David Allen | title = Noah's Ark: The Evidence | publisher = Artisan | location = Muscogee, OK | pages = | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-933677-02-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Dawes  | first = June  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Noah's Ark: Adrift in Dark Waters  | publisher = Noahide  | year = 2000  | location = Belrose, NSW  | pages = 184  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 0-646-40228-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The description of medieval geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]]  matches exactly a 2089 m peak north of [[Silopi]], that is now called ''Jabal Judi'' or ''Judi Dagh'' by Muslims and ''Gardu'' by Christians and Jews.{{cn|date=January 2013}}

'''Mountain formation''' refers to the geological processes that underlie the formation of [[mountain]]s. These processes are associated with large-scale movements of the Earth's crust ([[List of tectonic plates|tectonic plates]]).&lt;ref name=Stanley&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth system history |author=Steven M.

The understanding of specific landscape features in terms of the underlying tectonic processes is called ''[[geomorphology|tectonic geomorphology]]'', and the study of geologically young or ongoing processes is called ''[[neotectonics]]''.&lt;ref name=Stuwe&gt;{{cite book |title=Geodynamics of the lithosphere: an introduction |author= Kurt Stüwe |chapter=§4.5 Geomorphology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwYcuMSUnxEC&amp;pg=PA178 |page=178 |isbn=3-540-71236-4 |date=2007 |publisher=Springer |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=January 2017}}

From the late 18th century until its replacement by [[plate tectonics]] in the 1960s [[geosyncline|geosyncline theory]] was used to explain much mountain-building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publish.illinois.edu/platetectonics/geosynclinal-theory/ |title=Geosynclinal Theory |last= |first= |date= |website=publish.illinois.edu |publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |access-date=March 8, 2018|quote=The major mountain-building idea that was supported from the 19th century and into the 20th is the geosynclinal theory.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of mountains==
{{See also|List of mountain types}}
There are four main types of mountains: '''volcanic''', '''fold''','''residual''', and '''block'''. A more detailed classification useful on a local scale predates plate tectonics and adds to these categories.&lt;ref name=Goudie&gt;{{cite book |author=Andrew Goudie |title=Encyclopedia of geomorphology; Volume 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHRU_6nUSR4C&amp;pg=PA701 |page=701 |isbn=0-415-32738-5 |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movements of [[tectonic plates]] create [[volcano]]es along the plate boundaries, which erupt and form mountains. A ''volcanic arc system'' is a series of volcanoes that form near a [[subduction]] zone where the crust of a sinking oceanic plate melts and drags water down with the subducting crust.&lt;ref name=Butz&gt;{{cite book |title=Science of Earth Systems |author=Stephen D Butz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JB4ArbvXXDEC&amp;pg=PA136 |page=136 |chapter = Chapter 8: Plate tectonics |isbn=0-7668-3391-7 |date=2004 |publisher=Thompson/Delmar Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most volcanoes occur in a band encircling the Pacific Ocean (the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]), and in another that extends from the Mediterranean across Asia to join the Pacific band in the Indonesian Archipelago. The most important types of volcanic mountain are ''composite cones'' or ''stratovolcanoes'' ([[Vesuvius]], [[Mount Kilimanjaro|Kilimanjaro]] and [[Mount Fuji]] are examples) and ''shield volcanoes'' (such as [[Mauna Loa]] on Hawaii, a [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] volcano).&lt;ref name=Gerrard1&gt;{{cite book |title=Mountain environments: an examination of the physical geography of mountains |chapter=Types of volcano |page=194 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jHnrVEyMhkQC&amp;pg=PA194 |isbn=0-262-07128-2 |date=1990 |publisher=MIT Press |author=John Gerrard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Decker&gt;{{cite book |title=Volcanoes |author= Robert Wayne Decker |author2=Barbara Decker |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BilBFXIW5c4C&amp;pg=PA113 |chapter=Chapter 8: Hot spots |isbn=0-7167-8929-9 |edition=4th |date=2005 |publisher=Macmillan |page=113 ''ff''}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A shield volcano has a gently sloping cone due to the low viscosity of the emitted material, primarily [[basalt]]. Mauna Loa is the classic example, with a slope of 4°-6°. (The relation between slope and viscosity falls under the topic of [[angle of repose]].&lt;ref name=Holmes&amp;Duff&gt;{{cite book |title=Holmes Principles of Physical Geology |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |date=2004 |edition=4th  |author=Arthur Holmes |authorlink = Arthur Holmes|author2=Donald Duff |authorlink2 = Donald Duff|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E6vknq9SfIIC&amp;pg=PT226 |page=209 |isbn=0-7487-4381-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) The composite volcano or stratovolcano has a more steeply rising cone (33°-40°),&lt;ref name=transactions&gt;{{cite book |title=Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, Volume 39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZlNDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA62 |page=62 |date=1898 |publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the higher viscosity of the emitted material, and eruptions are more violent and less frequent than for shield volcanoes. Besides the examples already mentioned are [[Mount Shasta]], [[Mount Hood]] and [[Mount Rainier]].&lt;ref name=Todd&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Physical Science |author=James Shipman |author2=Jerry D.

===Fold mountains===

[[File:Kolunchin Zardkuh.JPG|thumb|[[Zard-Kuh]], a fold mountain in the central [[Zagros]] range of Iran.]] 
When plates [[continental collision|collide]] or undergo [[subduction]] (that is – ride one over another), the plates tend to buckle and fold, forming mountains. Most of the major continental mountain ranges are associated with thrusting and folding or [[orogenesis]]. Examples are the [[Jura Mountains|Jura]] and the [[Zagros]] mountains.&lt;ref name=Hatcher&gt;{{cite book |title=4-D framework of continental crust |editor=Robert D Hatcher Jr. |editor2=MP Carlson | editor3=JH McBride &amp; JR Martinez Catalán |author=Michael P Searle |page=41 ''ff'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jD-zXhTfJuMC&amp;pg=PA41 |chapter=Diagnostic features and processes in the construction and evolution of Oman-, Zagros-, Himalayan-, Karakoram-, and Tibetan type orogenic belts |isbn=0-8137-1200-9 |publisher=Geological Society of America |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a fault block is raised or tilted, block mountains can result.&lt;ref name=Ryan&gt;{{cite book |title=CliffsQuickReview Earth Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PV_BabxTTkcC&amp;pg=PA94 |chapter=Figure 13-1 |author=Scott Ryan |isbn=0-471-78937-2 |date=2006 |publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher blocks are called ''[[horst (geology)|horst]]s'' and troughs are called ''[[graben]]s''. A spreading apart of the surface causes tensional forces. When the tensional forces are strong enough to cause a plate to split apart, it does so such that a center block drops down relative to its flanking blocks.

An example of this is the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada Range]], where [[Delamination (geology)|delamination]] created a block 650&amp;nbsp;km long and 80&amp;nbsp;km wide that consists of many individual portions tipped gently west, with east facing slips rising abruptly to produce the highest mountain front in the continental United States.&lt;ref name=Gerrard2&gt;{{cite book |title=Reference cited |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jHnrVEyMhkQC&amp;pg=PA9  |page=9 |author=John Gerrard |isbn=0-262-07128-2 |date=1990-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="delamination_lee"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.289.5486.1912|pmid=10988067|title=Osmium Isotopic Evidence for Mesozoic Removal of Lithospheric Mantle Beneath the Sierra Nevada, California|first5=SB|last5=Jacobsen|first4=JT|last4=Chesley|first3=RL|last3=Rudnick|first2=Q|date=2000|last2=Yin|last1=Lee|first1=C.-T.|journal=Science|volume=289|issue=5486|pages=1912–6|url=http://www.geol.umd.edu/~rudnick/Webpage/Lee_2000_Science.pdf|bibcode=2000Sci...289.1912L|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615170551/http://www.geol.umd.edu/~rudnick/Webpage/Lee_2000_Science.pdf|archivedate=2011-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uplifted passive margins===
Unlike [[orogeny|orogenic mountains]] there is no widely accepted [[geophysics|geophysical]] model that explains elevated passive continental margins such as the [[Scandinavian Mountains]], [[Eastern Greenland]], the [[Brazilian Highlands]] or Australia's [[Great Dividing Range]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geografitorget.se/gn/nr/2009/bil/1-03.pdf |title=atlantens kustberg och högslätter – gamla eller unga? |last1=Bonow |first1=Johan M. |last2= |first2= |date=2009 |website=www.geografitorget.se |publisher=Geografilärarnas Riksförening |access-date= |quote=|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenetal2013&gt;{{cite journal |last=Green |first=Paul F. |last2=Lidmar-Bergström |first2=Karna |last4=Bonow |first4=Johan M. |last3=Japsen |first3=Peter |last5=Chalmers |first5=James A. |author-link2=Karna Lidmar-Bergström |date=2013 |title=Stratigraphic landscape analysis, thermochronology and the episodic development of elevated, passive continental margins |url=http://www.geus.dk/publications/bull/nr30/index-uk.htm |journal=[[Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland|Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland Bulletin]] |publisher= |volume=30 |issue= |pages=18 |doi= |access-date=30 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924022226/http://www.geus.dk/publications/bull/nr30/index-uk.htm |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Different elevated passive continental margins most likely share the same mechanism of uplift. This mechanism is possibly related to far-field stresses in Earth’s [[lithosphere]]. According to this view elevated passived margins can be likened to giant [[anticline|anticlinal]] lithospheric [[fold (geology)|fold]]s, where folding is caused by horizontal compression acting on a thin to thick crust transition zone (as are all passive margins).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author-last=Japsen |author-first=Peter |author-last2=Chalmers|author-first2=James A. |author-last3=Green|author-first3=Paul F.|author-last4=Bonow|author-first4=Johan M. |date=2012|title=Elevated, passive continental margins: Not rift shoulders, but expressions of episodic, post-rift burial and exhumation|journal=[[Global and Planetary Change]]|volume=90-91|pages=73–86|bibcode=2012GPC....90...73J|doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2011.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Løseth and Hendriksen 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residual mountains===
{{further|Inselberg|bornhardt}}
{{unsourced section|date=July 2018}}
Residual mountains are formed as a result of erosion of an existing elevated area. They are also called mountains of [[denudation]].  

Examples in Europe include:
the [[Scottish Highlands]], the [[Scandinavian Mountains]], and [[Snowdonia]] in [[Wales]].

Examples in India include: the [[Aravalli Range]], the [[Nilgiri Mountains]] in [[Tamilnadu]], the [[Rajmahal Hills]], and the [[Eastern Ghats|Eastern]] and [[Western Ghats]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Models==
{{See also|Extensional tectonics|Rift valley|Rift|Prediction of volcanic activity|Geomorphology}}

===Hotspot volcanoes===
Hotspots are supplied by a magma source in the Earth's mantle called a [[mantle plume]]. Although originally attributed to a melting of subducted oceanic crust, recent evidence belies this connection.&lt;ref name=Stoffers&gt;{{cite book |title=Oceanic hotspots: intraplate submarine magmatism and tectonism |author=Y Niu |author2=MJ O'Hara  |last-author-amp=yes |chapter=Chapter 7: Mantle plumes are NOT from ancient oceanic crust |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7L34ffaODwC&amp;pg=PA239 |page=239 ''ff''   |editor=Roger Hékinian |editor2=Peter Stoffers | editor3=Jean-Louis Cheminée |isbn=3-540-40859-2 |date=2004 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism for plume formation remains a research topic.

===Fault blocks===
Several movements of the earth's crust that lead to mountains are associated with [[fault (geology)|fault]]s. These movements actually are amenable to analysis that can predict, for example, the height of a raised block and the width of an intervening rift between blocks using the [[rheology]] of the layers and the forces of [[isostasy]]. Early bent plate models predicting fractures and fault movements have evolved into today's kinematic and flexural models.&lt;ref name=Watts&gt;{{cite book |author=AB Watts |title=Isostasy and flexure of the lithosphere |page=295 |chapter=§7.2 Extensional tectonics and rifting |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CNkiZU7enWUC&amp;pg=PA295 |isbn=0-521-00600-7 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weissel&gt;{{cite book |title=Continental tectonics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gpIY2unrObEC&amp;pg=PA271 |author=GD Karner |author2=NW Driscoll  |last-author-amp=yes |editor=Conall Mac Niocaill |editor2=Paul Desmond Ryan |page=280 |chapter=Style, timing and distribution of tectonic deformation across the Exmouth Plateau, northwest Australia, determined from stratal architecture and quantitative basin modelling |isbn=1-86239-051-7 |date=1999 |publisher=Geological society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Nevadaite is a pale-green to turquoise colored mineral belonging to the phosphate group. It exhibits a radial crystal habit consisting of prismatic crystals covering areas up to 2&amp;nbsp;cm. It has a pale-blue streak, a [[Glass|vitreous]] luster, and is not [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]]. Nevadaite is in the orthorhombic crystal system and displays conchoidal fracture.&lt;ref name="webmineral"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nevadaite Mineral Data|url = http://webmineral.com/data/Nevadaite.shtml#.Vl-wN3arTIV|website = webmineral.com|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
[[File:Sedimentary-rock hosted gold deposits in Nevada.gif|left|thumb|269x269px]]
Nevadaite was first discovered in the Gold Quarry mine near the town of Carlin, Eureka County, Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nevadaite: Nevadaite mineral information and data.|url = http://www.mindat.org/min-25696.html|website = www.mindat.org|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unique conditions and amounts of phosphate, vanadate, arsenate, and uranate in this area led to the formation of two new minerals; one being nevadaite and the other being goldquarryite. The Gold Quarry mine has been operated by The Newmont Mining Corporation since 1985 for the extraction of [[Carlin–type gold deposit|Carlin-type gold deposits]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Nevadaite was discovered in February 1992 by Martin C. Jensen and was approved by the [[International Mineralogical Association]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is also found in a copper mine in Kyrgyzstan.

The '''Oleska shale gas deposit''' is an unconventional [[natural gas|gas]] area in [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]], [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast|Ivano-Frankivsk]] and [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]] oblasts in [[Ukraine]]. It will begin production in 2017 and will produce [[natural gas]] and [[Natural gas condensate|condensates]]. The total [[proven reserves]] of the Olesska gas field are around {{convert|53|e12cuft}} and production is slated to be around {{convert|1|e9cuft/d}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12893">The '''Pacific Equatorial Forest''' is a [[tropical forest]] ecosystem located at 0° latitude in coastal [[Ecuador]], in the province of [[Manabí Province|Manabí]]. The ecosystem is most notable for its high diversity of forest types unusually close in proximity. [[Tropical rainforest]], [[moist evergreen forest]], [[premontane cloud forest]], and [[tropical deciduous forest]] can all be encountered over the course of a one-day hike, and the change from one type of forest to another can occur in as little as 100 meters. 

The Pacific Equatorial Forests, along with the rest of the coastal forests of Ecuador, is considered the most threatened tropical forest in the world and is part of the Tumbes-Chocó-Magdalena biodiversity hotspot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tumbes-Choco-Magdalena|url=http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/tumbes_choco/Pages/default.aspx|work=Biodiversity Hotspots|publisher=Conservation International|accessdate=8 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809042100/http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/tumbes_choco/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=9 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As much as 98% of coastal tropical forest have already been lost in Ecuador, almost all occurring during the last three generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecuadorian Rainforest Restoration|url=http://www.climatetrust.org/ecuadorian.html|work=The Climate Trust|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pacific Equatorial Forest, in particular, represents the greatest concentration of unprotected forest in coastal Ecuador and has been designated by several international conservation organizations as a global conservation priority.[[File:Pacific Equatorial Forest a4t.jpg|thumb|The Pacific Equatorial Forest]]

== Location ==
The Pacific Equatorial Forests is bound by the shores of the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west and the peaks of the long and narrow Jama-Coaque Coastal Mountain Range, which stretches along the coast at an average distance of 10&amp;nbsp;km inland. The Pacific Equatorial Forest extends as far south as Cabo Posado, at 0 degrees and 22 minutes south of the equator, and as far north as Pedernales, at 0 degrees and 3 minutes north of the equator. However, patches of the ecosystem can be found as far north as Punta Tortuga and Galera at 0 degrees and 46 minutes north of the equator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pacific Equatorial Forests|url=http://3malliance.org/index.php?id=432|work=Ecosystem Profile|publisher=Third Millennium Alliance|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The core area of the Pacific Equatorial Forest covers two counties, [[Jama Canton|Jama]] and Pedernales, in the northwest of the province of [[Manabí Province|Manabí]] in Ecuador. The [[Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve|Jama-Coaque mountains]] (pronounced "Hama Ko-Ah-Kay") takes its name from the ancient civilization that thrived in the region from 355 B.C. to 1532 A.D; whose territory is believed to have been limited to this specific ecosystem and the adjacent coastline. The Pacific Equatorial Forest covers 650 square kilometres, or 65,000 hectares of land, of which approximately 19,000 hectares are still forested.

== Climate ==
The Pacific Equatorial Forest is subject to what is known as a [[tropical monsoon climate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tropical Monsoon Climate|url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/climate_systems/tropical_monsoon_1.html|publisher=The Physical Environment|accessdate=14 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324035928/http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/climate_systems/tropical_monsoon_1.html|archivedate=24 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecosystem is located directly adjacent to the changeover from the cold and dry [[Humboldt current|Humboldt ocean current]] from southern Chile and the warm El Niño ocean current (also known as the [[Equatorial Counter Current]]) from Panama. The cold water and air temperatures associated with the Humboldt Current inhibit rainfall in southern coastal Ecuador and [[Peru]], creating dry to arid conditions, whereas the warm temperaturas associated with the El Nino current create humid conditions with high rainfall in northern Ecuador and coastal Colombia. 

For its location at the confluence of these two ocean currents, the Pacific Equatorial Forest is a transition zone between the wettest forests (the Chocó in Colombia) and the driest desert (the Atacama in Peru) recorded on earth. This complex climatological effect is multiplied by the Jama-Coaque Coastal Mountain Range, whose sharp changes in altitude so close to the ocean account for wide variations in precipitation in very small expanses of land. The mountains rise to 845 metres (2,772 feet) above sea level at the highest peak, although the rest of the mountain range is a series of peaks that average 500–650 metres (1,640-2,132 feet) of altitude, which are shrouded in fog most of the year. 

Starting in late December, a change in atmospheric pressure shifts ocean currents so that warm waters come closer to shore and displace the cold waters. During this time, air and water temperatures, tides, sea levels and wave heights, and relative humidity all rise. These conditions produce heavy rainfall that used to last through August, but now usually only lasts into May. Rain during the rainy season is punctuated by sunny weather. 

The dry season, which now begins in June or July and lasts sometimes into mid January, is characterized by cooler temperatures and more overcast skies. The Bamboo House research station in the [[Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve]] has recorded an average daily temperature range of 24-31° Celsius (75-88° Fahrenheit) in the rainy season, and 19-29° Celsius (66-84° Fahrenheit) in the dry season. Throughout the entire coast of Ecuador, annual precipitation varies widely according to latitude, with as much as 8,000&amp;nbsp;mm of rain in the extreme north, close to the Colombian border, to as little as 300&amp;nbsp;mm in the extreme south, close to the Peruvian border. 

In the Pacific Equatorial Forest, which is located in between these two extremes, precipitation primarily varies according to elevation and proximity to the ocean. In the premontane cloud forest along the peaks of the coastal mountains, which strip wáter from the nearly constant cloud cover, annual precipitation is 2,000-3,000&amp;nbsp;mm, and the vegetation is green and lush year-round. Along the shoreline, annual rainfall can be as little as 800 mm, and in these much drier conditions the majority of trees shed their leaves during the dry season, creating tropical deciduous forest (also known as tropical dry forest).

== Wildlife ==
The Pacific Equatorial Forest provides habitat for  serves as habitat and key migratory channel for two endangered species of primates; the (mantled [[howler monkey]] and white-fronted [[capuchin monkey]])and six endangered species of felines, the ([[jaguar]], [[Cougar|puma]], [[ocelot]], [[oncilla]], [[margay]] and [[jaguarundi]]). Other endangered mammals include the [[tayra]], the [[three-toed sloth]], the western [[Common agouti|agouti]], and the spotted [[paca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CITES Species List|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.shtml|work=Appendix I, II, and 3|publisher=Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Endemic and/or rare species of birds include the Red-Masked Parakeet, Pale-browed Tinamou, Pacific Pygmy Owl, Esmeralda Woodstar hummingbird, Gray-backed Hawk, Guayaquil Woodpecker, Pacific Royal-Flycatcher, Plumbeous Kite, Rufous-headed Chachalaca, and the Chocó Toucan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birds|url=http://www.ceiba.org/loorfauna.htm|work=Wildlife at the Lalo Loor Dry Forest Reserve|publisher=Ceiba Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009, herpetologist Paul S. Hamilton discovered thirty new species of frog and one new species of snake in three remnants of Pacific Equatorial Forest (Lalo Loor Dry Forest Reserve, Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve, and Cerro Pata de Pajaro).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rain Frogs and a Slug-Sucking Snake New to Science but Nearly Extinct|url=http://reptilesandamphibians.org/news/press_releases/40_new_frogs.html|publisher=Reptile and Amphibian Ecology International|accessdate=14 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513195715/http://reptilesandamphibians.org/news/press_releases/40_new_frogs.html|archivedate=13 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pacific Equatorial Forest Th5787.jpg|thumb|A small path leading under the canopy of this tropical rainforest.]]

== Threats ==
The primary cause of [[deforestation]] in the region is the [[land conversion|conversion]] of native forest into cattle [[pasture]], a process which is aided by [[illegal logging]] and [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture. The deforestation figure in all of coastal Ecuador is 98%. The Pacific Equatorial Forest, which has suffered an estimated loss of 75% of its native forest, has thus fared somewhat better than the rest of the region owing to its limited access and more challenging topography. However, the construction of a new coastal highway through the region threatens to facilitate the deforestation of the last remnants of Pacific Equatorial Forest. 

In 2001, the Centro de Investigación de Bosques Tropicales (Tropical Forest Research Center) reported: "Due to the high rate of endemism, the mass elimination of forest habitat in the Coastal region over the last half-century represents one of the greatest species extinction events in history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mecham|first=Jefferson|title=Causes and consequences of deforestation in Ecuador|journal=Centro de Investigacion de los Bosques Tropicales|date=May 2001|url=http://www.rainforestinfo.org.au/projects/jefferson.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human consequences of regional deforestation have likewise been significant.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=January 2015}} The dramatic loss{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=January 2015}} of forest cover over the last 50 years has altered the rain cycle and caused a sharp decline{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=January 2015}} in regional precipitation. 

Whereas three generations ago the rainy season lasted eight months per year and the dry season four, that ratio has inverted, and now the rainy season barely lasts four months, followed by eight months of drought. Rivers that used to be viable year-round now run dry half of the year, crops fail, and droughts result in high death rates of livestock, an effect which is particularly acute during periods of theLa Nina ocean-atmosphere phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Con nueva emergencia agrícola se enfrentará la sequía|url=http://www.burodeanalisis.com/2011/03/29/con-nueva-emergencia-agricola-se-enfrentara-la-sequia/|accessdate=8 August 2011|newspaper=Buró de Análisis Informativo|date=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation status ==
There are three small ecological reserves that protect remnants of the Pacific Equatorial Forest: Cerro Pata de Pajaro (Fundación Tercer Mundo), the Lalo Loor Dry Forest Reserve (Ceiba Foundation) and the Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve (Third Millennium Alliance), which protect 1,000 acres, 500 acres, and 1250 acres respectively. 

The Three Forest Trail, established in 2010, is a 25-km-long trail that connects the dry forest of the Lalo Loor Dry Forest Reserve with the rainforest of the Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve via the cloud-forested mountain ridges. The trail is meant to function as an incentive for conservation, as all forest owners along the trail receive a percentage of the trail fees. 

However, the vast majority of the Pacific Equatorial Forest remains unprotected and continue to be logged and cleared for agriculture and cattle ranching. In 2009 the Ecuadorian Ministry of the Environment launched its ''Socio Bosque'' (Forest Partners) program, which provides forest owners with an annual conservation subsidy of $30 per hectare ($12/acre), has had some traction in the region but the long-term efficacy is still uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chiu|first=Marco A.|url=http://www.rainforestcoalition.org/documents/CDREDDSocioBoquefromEcuadorinBonnAugust09.pdf|title=Implementing REDD: The Socio Bosque Programme|publisher=Ministry of the Environment, Republic of Ecuador|accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1354">There are several rivers named '''Salmon River''' in Alaska.

* [[Salmon River (Portland Canal)]] arises from [[Salmon Glacier]] in British Columbia and flows through [[Hyder, Alaska]].
* [[Salmon River (Kobuk River)]] arises in the Baird Mountains of the Brooks Range and flows 60 miles south to join the [[Kobuk River]].
* The [[Sheenjek River]] was formerly named the Salmon River.

Other Salmon Rivers in Alaska include one on [[Chichagof Island]] (name may not be in current use), one arising in [[Glacier Bay National Monument]] and running through [[Gustavus, Alaska]], one emptying into [[Kuskokwim Bay]], and one a tributary of the [[Aniak River]].  The name is also listed as a synonym for several other rivers and is applied to a distributory watercourse of the South Fork, [[Kuskokwim River]].

==Description==
The Scandinavian and Russian taiga consists of [[conifer]]ous [[forest]]s dominated by ''[[Pinus sylvestris]]'' (in drier locations), often with an understory of ''[[Juniperus communis]]'', ''[[Picea abies]]'' and ''[[Picea obovata]]'' and a significant admixture of ''[[Betula pubescens]]'' and ''[[Betula pendula]]''. ''[[Larix sibirica]]'' is characteristic of the eastern part of the ecoregion.

It is bordered by the ecoregions of [[Scandinavian coastal conifer forests]] (west), [[Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands]] (northwest and upwards in the highlands and mountains), [[Kola Peninsula tundra]] (North), [[Northwest Russian-Novaya Zemlya tundra]] (northeast), [[Urals montane tundra and taiga]] (east) and [[Sarmatic mixed forests]] (south), by the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[White Sea]]. Geobotanically, it belongs to the Northeastern European [[floristic province]] of the [[Circumboreal Region]] of the [[Holarctic Kingdom]].

The '''Shuixian Zunwang''' are five [[Taoism in China|Taoist]] [[Taoist immortal|immortals]] worshipped as [[water gods|water]] and [[sea god]]s. They have various names in English including the Honorable Water Immortal Kings and the Gods of the Waters. Their worship seems to derive from a misunderstanding of one of [[Wu Zixu]]'s religious titles. They are believed to protect vessels in transit.

==History==
The worship of the Shuixian Zunwang as a quintet of [[wang (title)|kings]] appears to derive from a misunderstanding of one of [[Wu Zixu]]'s religious titles. ([[Chinese language|Chinese]] generally lacks [[plural number|plural noun forms]] and his [[Chinese surname|surname]] is a variant of the Chinese word for "five".)&lt;ref name=ayu/&gt; The honorable kings of the water immortals were first worshipped around [[Xiamen]],&lt;ref name=ayu/&gt; which became a stronghold for [[Southern Ming|Ming loyalists]] during the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] [[Qing conquest of the Ming|conquest of China]]. Under [[Koxinga]], the [[Zheng dynasty]] [[siege of Fort Zeelandia|defeated]] the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] on [[Dutch Taiwan|Taiwan]] and moved from a base at Xiamen to the area around [[Tainan]], which they ruled as the [[Kingdom of Tungning]]. They appear to have been responsible for the introduction of the worship of [[Fujian]]'s five kings there.&lt;ref name=ayu/&gt;

==Worship==
[[File:新港水仙宮.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A temple to the water immortals in [[Xingang, Chiayi|Xingang]] on Taiwan]]
The Shuixian Zunwang are worshipped as protectors of ships in transit.&lt;ref name=grandma/&gt; A shrine in their honor was included on most Taiwanese vessels during the imperial era; even today, most Taiwanese harbors include temples to them.&lt;ref name=ayu/&gt; Their shrines also appear in [[Mazuist]] temples.

China is the world's largest consumer of electricity, and its demand is expected to double by the next decade {{When|date = October 2015}}, and triple by 2035. In 2010, 70 percent of the country's electricity generation came from coal-fired power plants, but the Chinese government is investing heavily in renewable energy technologies. As of 2013, 21 percent of China's electricity generation comes from renewable sources.&lt;ref name=EIA&gt;{{cite web|title=China: International energy data and analysis |url=http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis.cfm?iso=CHN |website=US Energy Information Administration |accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents only 9 percent of overall primary energy consumption in the country. China's latest goal is to increase renewable energy to 9.5 percent of overall primary energy use by 2015. To implement China's new clean energy capacity into the national [[Electrical grid|power grid]], and to improve the reliability of the country's existing infrastructure, requires significant upgrades and ultimately, a [[smart grid]].&lt;ref name="WSJArticle"&gt;{{cite web|title=China's Energy Consumption Rises the Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704615504576171922168262078|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=11 April 2012|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A smart grid differs from a conventional power grid in that it includes a system of [[information and communication technologies]] to bidirectionally transmit and distribute electricity more efficiently and reliably. Additionally, this technology allows consumers to manage their power usage and make choices for economically efficient products and services. China's national utility, the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), is responsible for the oversight of these upgrades.

== History ==
[[File:Electricity production in China.PNG|thumb|300px|Electricity production in China till 2005]]

===Smart meters===

During 2011 SGCC took bids for 44 million smart meter units. In total, 65 companies received bids for smart meters from SGCC. The total smart meter market in China is estimated to be 330&amp;nbsp;million smart meter units worth approximately US$7.7&amp;nbsp;billion. By 2011, SGCC had deployed 45&amp;nbsp;million smart meter units. All SGCC users are expected to be equipped with smart meters by 2014.&lt;ref name=SMMarket&gt;{{cite web|title=China's smart meter market potential – 330m meters, $7.7bn|url=http://www.greentelecomlive.com/2011/07/11/chinas-smart-meter-market-potential-330m-meters-7-7bn/|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{update|section|date=October 2015}}

===Battery energy storage station===
In December 2011 construction on battery energy storage station residing in Zhangbei, Hebei Province was completed by BYD and SGCC. The storage station is capable of storing 36 MWh of energy in a series of lithium iron-phosphate batteries approximately the size of a football field.  Designed to be implemented in conjunction with a 140 MW expansion of renewable energy (solar and wind), this project is worth over US$500&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="BatteryArticle"&gt;{{cite web|title=Massive battery energy storage station kicks off in China|url=http://gigaom.com/cleantech/massive-battery-energy-storage-station-kicks-off-in-china/|publisher=Gigaom|accessdate=10 April 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BatteryArticle2"&gt;{{cite web|title=China &amp; BYD Launch Largest Battery Energy Storage Station in World|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2012/01/03/china-byd-launch-largest-battery-energy-storage-station/|publisher=CleanTechnica.com|accessdate=10 April 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital substations===
The first digital substation was built in China in 2006. By 2009 China had implemented more than 70 digital substations.&lt;ref name="MarketingInformation" /&gt; The implementation of digital substations is critical to the smart grid because of it allows for processing of energy generated from conventional and renewable sources, protects the grid from attack, and communicates with the rest of the grid.{{update|secgtion|date=October 2015}}

===Flexible power transmission===
For flexible power transmission in the grid, substantial infrastructure upgrades must be made to the existing power grid. This is primarily being done by upgrading the existing power grid to a system capable of transmitting ultra high voltage AC and ultra high voltage DC power.  Over half of China's investment in flexible power transmission is in the form of [[static VAR compensator]]s or SVCs. In 2009, SGCC announced its plan to invest approximately 88&amp;nbsp;billion dollars in ultra high voltage equipment.&lt;ref name="MarketingInformation" /&gt;

===Electric vehicle charging equipment===
In August 2009 SGCC established its first commercially available electric vehicle charging station, the Caoxi Electrical Vehicle Charging Station. As of 2010,{{update|date=October 2015}} 76 electric vehicle charging stations have been built in 41 Chinese cities.  Continued investment in electric car infrastructure reflects the country's goal of having 500,000 electric, hybrid and fuel-cell vehicles on the road by 2015 and 5&amp;nbsp;million by 2020,.&lt;ref name="MarketingInformation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marketing Information|url=http://www.smartgridtec-china.com/index.php/English/about_sc|publisher=smart grid tec – china|accessdate=9 April 2012|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChargingArticle"&gt;{{cite web|title=China's largest electric car charging station opens in Beijing|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2012-01/29/c_131381459.htm|publisher=xinhuannet|accessdate=9 April 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another $240 billion between 2016 and 2020 will be added to complete the smart grid project.&lt;ref name=CAP&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hart|first1=Melanie|title=China Pours Money into Smart Grid Technology|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/report/2011/10/24/10473/china-pours-money-into-smart-grid-technology/|website=Center for American Progress|accessdate=16 June 2015|date=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pilot Programs===
[[File:Honeywell Automated Demand Response (ADR) Diagram.jpg|thumb|Automated Demand Response (ADR) Diagram]]
In 2012, China’s Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA) signed an agreement with the [[U.S. Trade and Development Agency]] (USTDA) to deploy its first demand response pilot project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.paulsoninstitute.org/media/152026/how_a_chinese_city_saved_millions_in_energy_costs_-_honeywell_case_study.pdf|title = How a Chinese City Saved Millions in Energy Costs|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Honeywell was selected in 2011 to develop the smart grid project and implement its automated demand response (ADR) technology to temporarily decrease energy use in commercial and industrial facilities. The reduction is triggered when citywide consumption peaks and threatens to outpace the ability to produce power, which creates instability, and the potential for brownouts and blackouts. The project is part of a grant agreement between the State Grid Electric Power Research Institute (SGEPRI), a subsidiary of [[State Grid Corporation of China]], and the USTDA.

Auto DR looks at energy use as a dynamic variable in balancing supply and demand. Implementation of the Honeywell pilot project gave SGCC the latest technologies and perspective on how to realize the benefits of demand response. China is the World's largest Transmission and Distribution market with capital expenditures on power lines growing at an annual rate of 15 to 20 percent until 2018.&lt;ref name="Information2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Can the smart grid live up to its expectations?|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/Client_Service/Electric_Power_and_Natural_Gas/Latest_thinking/McKinsey_on_Smart_Grid|publisher=Mckinsey news|accessdate=10 April 2012|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this level of investment, US companies can test and commercialize technology in China at a faster and larger scale than in other parts of the World, including developed countries. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The agencies involved in the ADR pilot deemed it a success and the technology is now being implemented in other parts of China, including Shanghai. The results of the program showed that "the industrial site’s load reduction varied with production schedule. The site saw a reduction of 7.7 percent during full production periods. When not operating at full production, the site’s demand response shed capacity increased more than 30 percent. The two commercial buildings provided a more stable and consistent load shed response, shedding between 15 and 20 percent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.paulsoninstitute.org/media/152026/how_a_chinese_city_saved_millions_in_energy_costs_-_honeywell_case_study.pdf|title = How a Chinese City Saved Millions in Energy Costs|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Deployments===
According to the Chinese authorities{{Which|date=October 2015}} a strong and robust smart grid market would total  $20 billion annually by 2015. Rolling out Ultra-High Voltage (UHV) transmission systems would account for more than 60% of that market, while smart meters and wind power connectivity could reach $2 billion and $800 million annually respectively.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

SGCC has implemented these smart grid technologies in areas such as Liangjiang, with the project there passing inspection in Q3 of 2014.&lt;ref name=Liangjiang&gt;{{cite web|title=Liangjiang smart grid construction passes State Grid's inspection|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/regional/chongqing/liangjiang/2014-08/20/content_18452181.htm|website=China Daily|accessdate=16 June 2015|date=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It currently comprises one 220&amp;nbsp;kV substation and seven 110&amp;nbsp;kV substations. SGCC also launched the first UHV power grid in Tianjin in November 2014. The project calls for 290 transmission towers to be built, with 22 of those already constructed. Tianjin currently imports 20 percent of its electricity, and this project will increase that total to 30 percent with an estimated additional capacity of 5 million KW. Tianjin’s maximum voltage will also double, from 500&amp;nbsp;kV to 1000&amp;nbsp;kV, all while reducing coal consumption by 9 million tons, as well as reducing carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrous oxide emissions.&lt;ref name="Tianjin"&gt;{{cite web|title=First ultra-high voltage power grid launches in Tianjin|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/tianjin2012/2014-11/05/content_18872747.htm|website=China Daily|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) approached SGCC for a technical partnership and expertise to help the Philippines in their smart grid pilot project in Antipolo.&lt;ref name="PH grid"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miraflor|first1=Madelaine|title=China to help PH build smart grid|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1509437587|accessdate=16 June 2015|agency=McClatchy - Tribune Business News|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4386">A '''sustainable community energy system''' is an integrated approach to supplying a local community with its energy requirements from [[renewable energy]] or high-efficiency [[co-generation]] energy sources. The approach can be seen as a development of the [[distributed generation]] concept.

Such systems are based on a combination of [[district heating]], [[district cooling]], plus '[[electricity generation island]]s' that are interlinked via a private wire electricity system (largely bypassing the normal [[power grid]] to cut transmission losses and charges, as well as increasing the robustness of the system). The surplus from one generating island can therefore be used to make up the deficit at another.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]] the first sustainable community energy system was pioneered by [[Woking]] [[Borough]] [[Municipality|Council]], starting in 1991. The system uses traditional and a [[Phosphoric-acid fuel cell|phosphoric acid fuel cell]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20060911140743/http://www.woking.gov.uk/html/queensaward/W-19.pdf] co-generation plants, [[thermal store|thermal storage]], heat fired [[absorption cooling]] and [[photovoltaics]] (over 9% of the UK's small capacity), to supply both residential and non-residential customers, as well as the Council's own facilities. By end of 2005 there were over 60 generating islands in the Borough.

Despite the investment in the plant, the system delivers cheaper energy than can be supplied from the traditional 'brown energy' suppliers, helping to tackle [[fuel poverty]]. It is part of a plan to cut local [[carbon dioxide]] emissions by 80% by 2050. Their initiatives won the Council the [[Queen's Award for Enterprise]] in 2002 [https://web.archive.org/web/20070102051259/http://www.woking.gov.uk/news/archive?item=988025744].

The [[London Climate Change Agency]] is starting to construct a similar system in [[London]].

==Germany==
In 1997, people of [[Wildpoldsried]], in some cases acting as individuals, began a series of projects that produce renewable energy. The first efforts were [[wind turbine]]s and [[biomass]] digesters for [[cogeneration]] of heat and power.  In the time since, new work has included a number of [[energy conservation]] projects, more wind and biomass use, [[small hydro]] plants, [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic panels]] on private houses, and [[district heating]].  Tied to this are ecological [[flood control]] and [[wastewater]] systems.

Today, the effects of this are an unforeseen level of prosperity resulting in construction of nine new community buildings, including a school, gymnasium, and community hall, complete with solar panels.  There are three companies operating four biogas digesters with a fifth under construction.  There are seven windmills with two more on the way. One hundred and ninety private households are equipped with solar, which pays them dividends.  The district heating network has 42 connections.  There are three small hydro power plants. Wildpoldsried now produces 321 percent more energy than it needs and is generating 4.0 million Euro in annual revenue.  At the same time, there has been a 65% reduction in the town’s carbon footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=German Village Achieves Energy Independence … And Then Some  |publisher=BioCycle |date=August 2011 |volume= 52, No. 8, p. 37 |url=http://www.biocycle.net/2011/08/german-village-achieves-energy-independence-and-then-some/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2273">'''Technora''' is an [[aramid]] that is useful for a variety of applications that require high strength or chemical resistance. It is a brand name of the company [[Teijin Aramid]]. It was also used to suspend the NASA Mars rover [[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]] from its parachute during descent. It will be used again in the parachute for the [[Mars 2020]] rover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/space/go-for-launch/dp-nws-aspire-parachute-launch-20180322-story.html|title=Supersonic parachute for Mars 2020 rover to test-launch from Wallops|last=Dietrich|first=Tamara|work=OrlandoSentinel.com|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Technora is produced by [[condensation polymerization]] of [[terephthaloyl chloride]] (TCl) with a mixture of [[p-phenylenediamine]] (PPD) and 3,4'-diaminodiphenylether (3,4'-ODA).&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Kwolek, Hiroshi Mera, Tadahiko Takata “High-Performance Fibers” in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a13_001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The polymer is closely related to Teijin Aramids's [[Twaron]] or DuPont's [[Kevlar]]. Technora is derived from two different diamines, 3,4'-ODA and PPD, whereas Twaron is derived from PPD alone.  This relatively simple process uses only one amide solvent, and therefore spinning can be done directly after the polymer production.

{{About|a type of rock|the rock and roll band|Thunderegg (band)}}
[[File:Black rock desert thunderegg.JPG|thumb|250px|A thunderegg from the [[Black Rock Desert]] in Nevada]]
A '''thunderegg''' (or '''thunder egg''') is a [[Nodule (geology)|nodule]]-like [[Rock (geology)|rock]], similar to a filled [[geode]], that is formed within [[Rhyolite|rhyolitic]] [[volcanic ash]] layers.&lt;ref name = "USGS Oregon"&gt;{{cite web | title = America's Volcanic Past - Oregon | publisher = USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory | url = http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/LivingWith/VolcanicPast/Places/volcanic_past_oregon.html | accessdate = 2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thundereggs are rough [[sphere]]s, most about the size of a [[Baseball (ball)|baseball]]—though they can range from less than an inch to over a meter across. They usually contain centres of [[chalcedony]] which may have been fractured followed by deposition of [[agate]], [[jasper]] or [[opal]],&lt;ref name = "USGS Oregon"/&gt; either uniquely or in combination.  Also frequently encountered are [[quartz]] and [[gypsum]] crystals, as well as various other mineral growths and inclusions.  Thundereggs usually look like ordinary rocks on the outside, but slicing them in half and polishing them may reveal intricate patterns and colours.  A characteristic feature of thundereggs is that (like other agates) the individual [[Bed (geology)|bed]]s they come from can vary in appearance, though they can maintain a certain specific identity within them. 

Thunderegg is not synonymous with either [[geode]] or [[agate]].  A geode is a simple term for a rock with a hollow in it, often with crystal formation/growth.  A thunderegg on the other hand is a specific [[Structural geology|geological structure]].  A thunderegg may be referred to as a geode if it has a hollow in it (see illustration of Gehlberg specimen), but not all geodes are thundereggs because there are many different ways for a hollow to form.  Similarly, a thunderegg is just one of the forms that [[agate]] can assume.

==Occurrence==
Thundereggs are found globally where conditions are optimal.  In the US, [[Oregon]] is one of the most famous thunderegg locations.  [[Germany]] is also an important center for thunderegg agates (especially sites like St Egidien and Gehlberg). Other places known for thundereggs include [[Ethiopia]],&lt;ref name="EthEggs"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thundereggs.co.uk/ethiopia.html | title=Thundereggs from Ethiopia | work=Eibonvale Thunderegg Gallery | accessdate=19 May 2017 | author=Rix, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poland]],&lt;ref name="PolEggs"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thundereggs.co.uk/poland.html | title=Thundereggs from Poland | work=Eibonvale Thunderegg Gallery | accessdate=19 May 2017 | author=Rix, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romania]], [[Turkey]], [[Mexico]], [[Argentina]],&lt;ref name="ArgEggs"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thundereggs.co.uk/argentina.html | title=Thundereggs from Argentina | work=Eibonvale Thunderegg Gallery | accessdate=19 May 2017 | author=Rix, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canada]], Mount Hay&lt;ref name="MtHay"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.digthetropic.com.au/experiences/strike-it-rich/mt-hay/ | title=Mount Hay | publisher=Capricorn Enterprise | work=Dig the Tropic: Outback to the Reef | accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tamborine Mountain]],&lt;ref name="Tamborine"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/queensland/tamborine-mountain/2005/02/17/1108500203758.html | title=Tamborine Mountain | publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald | work=Sydney Morning Herald | date=15 August 2008 | accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Australia) and the [[Esterel massif]],&lt;ref name="Esterel"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://richardjeanjacques.blogspot.co.uk/2009/02/les-oeufs-de-tonnerre.html | title=Les Oeufs de Tonnerre | work=Bijoux et pierres precieuses | date=1 February 2009 | accessdate=19 May 2017 | author=Richard, Jean-Jacques | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; (France).{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Formation==
Thundereggs are found in flows of [[rhyolite lava]]. They form in gas pockets in the lava, which act as molds, from the action of water [[Percolation|percolating]] through the porous rock carrying [[silica]] in solution. The deposits lined and filled the cavity, first with a darker matrix material, then an inner core of agate or chalcedony. The various colors come from differences in the [[mineral]]s found in the [[soil]] and rock that the water has moved through.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/Oregon/StateRockThunderegg.html Thunderegg Oregon State Rock, StateSymbols USA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==State rock designation==
On March&amp;nbsp;30, 1965, the thunderegg was designated as the Oregon [[List of U.S. state minerals, rocks, stones and gemstones|state rock]] by a joint resolution of the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]].&lt;ref name=shg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shgresources.com/or/symbols/rock/|title=Oregon Symbols|publisher=SHG Resources|accessdate=2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ORS&gt;[http://www.leg.state.or.us/ors/186.html Chapter 186 — State Emblems; State Boundary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311194726/http://www.leg.state.or.us/ors/186.html |date=2007-03-11 }} 2005 [[Oregon Revised Statutes]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rock Hounding | publisher = Nature of the Northwest | url = http://www.naturenw.org/rock-thundereggs.htm | accessdate = 2007-09-17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928020653/http://www.naturenw.org/rock-thundereggs.htm | archivedate = 2007-09-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; While thundereggs can be collected all over Oregon, the largest deposits are found in [[Crook County, Oregon|Crook]], [[Jefferson County, Oregon|Jefferson]], [[Malheur County, Oregon|Malheur]], [[Wasco County, Oregon|Wasco]] and [[Wheeler County, Oregon|Wheeler]] counties.&lt;ref name=obb&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/facts-almanac.aspx|title=Oregon Almanac|publisher=Oregon Blue Book|accessdate=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world’s largest thunderegg, a 1.75 ton specimen, is housed by the [[Rice Northwest Museum of Rocks and Minerals]] in Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Christie, Tim|title=Rock hounds check out goods at 18th annual Gem Faire|newspaper=The Register-Guard|location=Eugene, Oregon|date=March 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
Native American legend reportedly considers the rocks to be the eggs of the [[Thunderbird (mythology)|thunderbird]]s which occupied [[Mount Hood]] and [[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)]]. Thunder Spirits on the mountains hurled the "eggs" at each other.&lt;ref name = "Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries"/&gt;

Turkey is also member of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). It has signed free trade agreements with the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA), Israel, and many other countries. In 1992, Turkey and 10 other regional nations formed the [[Black Sea Economic Cooperation Business Council]] to expand regional trade and economic cooperation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2118">A '''waterbody number''', '''waterbody index number''' or '''waterbody ID''' is used for the [[Hydrography|hydrographic]] classification of [[waterbodies]]. Where classification only covers bodies of flowing water such as rivers, it may be called a '''watercourse number'''.

Many different systems are used in [[limnology]] to number waterbodies such as lakes, rivers and streams, ranging from basic index numbers representing their location in the [[river system]], such as serial numbers for the major [[drainage basin|catchment areas]] of the rivers, or numbers indicating their hierarchical position in the system. On the basis of such numbers the aim is to give waterbodies, river sections or catchment areas a clear  [[identification number]]. As a result of the systems used in various specialist fields there may even be different national and regional waterbody index numbers for the same body of water.

== Stream order ==
A general geographical and hydrographical classification uses [[Strahler number]]s to determine the:
* [[Stream order]] – the level of the waterbody in the hydrographical hierarchical classification system (there are several different systems)

=== National terminology or systems ===
* ''[[Gewässerkennzahl]]'' ("watercourse index number"), [[Germany]]
* ''[[HZB Code]]'' ("waterbody index number"; legally defined, HZB code, OWK No., WRRL codes), [[Austria]]
* [[River basin number (Finland)|River basin number]], [[Finland]]
* ''[[Sandre]]'', [[France]]
* Watercourse number, [[Pakistan]]
* [[State Water Register]], [[Russia]]
* ''[[Gewässerlaufnummer]]'' ("waterbody serial number"), [[Switzerland]]
* ''[[Čislo hydrologického pořadí]]'' ("hydrological order number"), [[Czech Republic]]
* Waterbody number, waterbody ID, [[United Kingdom]]
* Waterbody number, waterbody index number, [[Geographic Names Information System]], [[United States]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1406">The '''Western Zambezian grasslands''' is a [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|tropical grassland]] [[ecoregion]] of eastern [[Zambia]] and adjacent parts of [[Angola]].

==Setting==
The Western Zambezian grasslands are found in areas of sandy soil north and south of the [[Barotse Floodplain]] in eastern Zambia. They are characterized by deep,sandy, nutrient-poor soils which are waterlogged during the rainy season, and become very dry during the dry season. They are intertwined with the [[Zambezian Cryptosepalum dry forests]] ecoregion, which is found on similar soils at slightly higher elevations with better drainage. Surrounding ecoregions include the [[Zambezian flooded grasslands]] of the Barotse Floodplain, the [[Angolan Miombo woodlands]] to the northwest, the [[Central Zambezian Miombo woodlands]] to the northeast and east, and the [[Zambezian Baikiaea woodlands]] to the east and south.

'''Whites Creek''', formerly known as '''White's Creek''', was once a [[Creek (tidal)|natural waterway]] that was concreted to improve sanitation.&lt;ref name=leichhardt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leichhardt.nsw.gov.au/Recreation/Parks-and-Playgrounds/Parks-in-Lilyfield/Whites-Creek-Valley-Park |title=Whites Creek Valley Park |work=Parks and Playgrounds |publisher=[[Inner West Council]] |date= |access-date=17 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The creek is now an [[New South Wales State Heritage Register|heritage{{endash}}listed]] [[canal|artificial waterway]] located in the [[Inner West|inner{{endash}}west]] region of [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], Australia.

==Course and features==
Sanitation was poor in the first 100 years of the new colony, and the waterways were contaminated.  The waterway was concreted and became a Whites Creek Channel between 1898 and 1935, to cope with the runnoff from the increasing amount of impermeal surfaces  that. The Whites Creek [[storm drain]] as it is now, is located in flows in a northerly direction into [[Rozelle Bay]], part of the [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sydneywater.com.au/SW/water-the-environment/what-we-re-doing/Heritage-search/heritage-detail/index.htm?heritageid=4570343 |title=Whites Creek Stormwater Channel No 95 |work= |publisher=[[Sydney Water]] |date=1 January 2000 |access-date=17 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, an [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] was built to carry the sewerage over Whites Creek. This was the first use of the [[Joseph_Monier#The_Monier_name_in_Australia|Monier]] system of reinforced concrete in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sydneywater.com.au/SW/water-the-environment/what-we-re-doing/Heritage-search/heritage-detail/index.htm?heritageid=4570954 |title=Whites Creek Sewage Aqueduct |work= |publisher=[[Sydney Water]] |date=1 January 2000 |access-date=17 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wetlands were constructed adjacent to the Whites Creek Channel in 2002, to filter out excess nutrients and improve the quality of water flowing into the harbour.&lt;ref name=leichhardt/&gt;

==Etymology==
Whites Creek is named in honour of [[John_White_(surgeon)|John White]], the surgeon to the [[First Fleet]]. White received a land grant, which he named Hamond Hill Farm, to the south of [[Parramatta Road]], where Whites Creek has its source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AuDB |first=Rex |last=Rienits |authorlink= |title=White, John (1756–1832) |volume=2 |edition= |year=1967 |id2=white-john-2787 |accessdate=17 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map |url=http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/album/albumView.aspx?itemID=940868&amp;acmsid=0 |title=Map of the Estate named Annandale situate in the Parish of Petersham and District of Sydney the property of Robert Johnston Esq.

'''Zuni Salt Lake''', also '''Zuñi Salt Lake''' is a rare high desert lake, and a classic [[maar]]. It is located in [[Catron County, New Mexico|Catron County]], about 60 miles south of the [[Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico]], USA.  Zuñi Salt Lake is extremely shallow, with a depth of only four feet in the wet season. During the dry season, much of the water evaporates leaving behind [[Salt pan (geology)|saltflat]]s.  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/NM/Catron/state.html National Register of Historic Places – Catron County, New Mexico]. Retrieved 6/16/07.&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the [[Red Hill volcanic field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==History==
For centuries, the [[Pueblo people]] of the Southwest, including the [[Zuni people|Zuni]], [[Acoma Pueblo|Acoma]], [[Laguna (people)|Laguna]], [[Hopi]] and [[Taos Pueblo|Taos]] pueblos, have made annual pilgrimages to Zuñi Salt Lake to harvest salt, for both culinary and ceremonial purposes. Ancient roadways radiate out from the lake to the various [[pueblo]]s and ancient pueblo sites, such as [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park|Chaco]]. The lake itself is considered sacred, home of the Salt Mother [[deity]], known to the Zuñi as Ma'l Okyattsik'i. Also known as Las Salinas to early Hispanic settlers in the area.

Famous Indian chief Geronimo, in ''Geronimo's Story of His Life'' reported the following about the lake: "We obtained our salt from a little lake in the Gila Mountains.... When visiting this lake our people were not allowed to even kill game or attack an enemy. All creatures were free to go and come without molestation."

The Zuni Salt Lake was not part of the Zuñi reservation originally recognized by the U.S. government, but the U.S. returned the lake itself, and {{convert|5000|acre|ha km2}} surrounding it, to Zuni control in 1985.

==Controversy==
From 1994 to 2003, there was a proposal to develop a coal mine near the Zuni Salt Lake.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050207202303/http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/200211/winona.asp LaDuke, Winona (2002) "The Salt Woman and the Coal Mine" ''Sierra Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030904190614/http://www.achp.gov/casearchive/casesspg03NM-AZ.html Legard, Carol (August 15, 2003) "New Mexico and Arizona: Construction of Fence Lake Mine" U.S. Advisory Council on Historic Preservation]&lt;/ref&gt; It would have involved extraction of water from the [[aquifer]] below the lake as well as construction between the lake and the Pueblo of Zuñi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040725084912/http://www.sacredland.org/zuni_salt_lake.html ''Zuni Salt Lake'' Earth Island Institute (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040718185853/www.sacredland.org/Bowekaty.pdf ''Testimony of Malcolm B. Bowekaty, Governor of the Zuni Tribe'' before the United States Senate, Committee on Indian Affairs, July 17, 2002, Washington, D.C.]&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was withdrawn after several lawsuits, and is regarded as an important exercise of [[native rights]] in the United States.
