      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7989">In [[algebraic logic]], an '''action algebra''' is an [[algebraic structure]] which is both a [[residuated semilattice]] and a [[Kleene algebra]].  It adds the star or reflexive transitive closure operation of the latter to the former, while adding the left and right residuation or implication operations of the former to the latter.  Unlike [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]] and other modal logics of programs, for which programs and propositions form two distinct sorts, action algebra combines the two into a single sort.  It can be thought of as a variant of [[Heyting algebra|intuitionistic logic]] with star and with a noncommutative conjunction whose identity need not be the top element.  Unlike Kleene algebras, action algebras form a [[Algebraic variety|variety]], which furthermore is finitely axiomatizable, the crucial axiom being ''a''•(''a'' → ''a'')* ≤ ''a''.  Unlike models of the equational theory of Kleene algebras (the regular expression equations), the star operation of action algebras is reflexive transitive closure in every model of the equations.

==Definition==

An '''action algebra''' (''A'', ∨, 0, •, 1, ←, →, *) is an [[algebraic structure]] such that (''A'', ∨, •, 1, ←, →) forms a [[residuated semilattice]] while (''A'', ∨, 0, •, 1, *) forms a [[Kleene algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Now Kleene algebras are axiomatized with quasiequations, that is, implications between two or more equations, whence so are action algebras when axiomatized directly in this way.  However, action algebras have the advantage that they also have an equivalent axiomatization that is purely equational.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In the following we write the inequality ''a'' ≤ ''b'' as an abbreviation for the equation ''a'' ∨ ''b'' = ''b''.  This allows us to axiomatize the theory using inequalities yet still have a purely equational axiomatization when the inequalities are expanded to equalities.

The equations axiomatizing action algebra are those for a residuated semilattice, together with the following equations for star.
::: 1 ∨ ''a''*•''a''* ∨ ''a''  &amp;nbsp; ≤ &amp;nbsp; ''a''*
::: ''a''* ≤ (''a''∨''b'')*
::: (''a'' → ''a'')* &amp;nbsp; ≤ &amp;nbsp; ''a'' → ''a''

The first equation can be broken out into three equations, 1 ≤ ''a''*, ''a''*•''a''* ≤ ''a''*, and ''a'' ≤ ''a''*.  These force ''a''* to be reflexive, transitive,{{clarify|reason=These are properties of binary relations. Explain why a* can be considered as a binary relation.|date=June 2014}} and greater or equal to ''a'' respectively.  The second axiom asserts that star is monotone.  The third axiom can be written equivalently as ''a''•(''a''→''a'')* ≤ ''a'', a form which makes its role as induction more apparent.  These two axioms in conjunction with the axioms for a residuated semilattice force ''a''* to be the least reflexive transitive element of the semilattice greater or equal to ''a''.  Taking that as the definition of reflexive transitive closure of ''a'', we then have that for every element ''a'' of any action algebra, ''a''* is the reflexive transitive closure of ''a''.

The equational theory of the implication-free fragment of action algebras, those equations not containing → or ←, can be shown to coincide with the equational theory of Kleene algebras, also known as the [[regular expression]] equations.  In that sense the above axioms constitute a finite axiomatization of regular expressions.  Redko showed in 1967 that these equations had no finite axiomatization, for which [[John Horton Conway]] gave a shorter proof in 1971.  Salomaa gave an equation schema axiomatizing this theory which Kozen subsequently reformulated as a finite axiomatization using quasiequations or implications between equations, the crucial quasiequations being those of induction: if ''x''•''a'' ≤ ''x'' then ''x''•''a''* ≤ ''x'', and if ''a''•''x'' ≤ ''x'' then ''a''*•''x'' ≤ ''x''.  Kozen defined a Kleene algebra to be any model of this finite axiomatization.

Conway showed that the equational theory of regular expressions admit models in which ''a''* was not the reflexive transitive closure of ''a'', by giving a four-element model 0 ≤ 1 ≤ ''a'' ≤ ''a''* in which ''a''•''a'' = ''a''.  In Conway's model, ''a'' is reflexive and transitive, whence its reflexive transitive closure should be ''a''.  However the regular expressions do not enforce this, allowing ''a''* to be strictly greater than ''a''.  Such anomalous behavior is not possible in an action algebra.

==Examples==
Any [[Heyting algebra]] (and hence any [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]) is made an action algebra by taking • to be ∧ and ''a''* = 1.  This is necessary and sufficient for star because the top element 1 of a Heyting algebra is its only reflexive element, and is transitive as well as greater or equal to every element of the algebra.

The set 2&lt;sup&gt;Σ*&lt;/sup&gt; of all [[formal language]]s (sets of finite strings) over an alphabet Σ forms an action algebra with 0 as the empty set, 1 = {ε}, ∨ as union, • as concatenation, ''L''←''M'' as the set of all strings ''x'' such that ''xM'' ⊆ ''L'' (and dually for ''M''→''L''), and ''L''* as the set of all strings of strings in ''L'' (Kleene closure).

The set 2&lt;sup&gt;''X''²&lt;/sup&gt; of all binary relations on a set ''X'' forms an action algebra with 0 as the empty relation, 1 as the identity relation or equality, ∨ as union, • as relation composition, ''R''←''S'' as the relation consisting of all pairs (''x,y'') such that for all ''z'' in ''X'', ''ySz'' implies ''xRz'' (and dually for ''S''→''R''), and ''R*'' as the reflexive transitive closure of ''R'', defined as the union over all relations ''R''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for integers ''n'' ≥ 0.

The two preceding examples are power sets, which are [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebras]] under the usual set theoretic operations of union, intersection, and complement.  This justifies calling them '''Boolean action algebras'''.  The relational example constitutes a [[relation algebra]] equipped with an operation of reflexive transitive closure.  Note that every Boolean algebra is a Heyting algebra and therefore an action algebra by virtue of being an instance of the first example.

[[File:Mechanics-bank-arm-hammer-tn1.jpg|thumb|Arm-and-hammer symbol at the [[Mechanics' Bank and Trust Company Building]] in Knoxville, Tennessee]]
The '''arm and hammer''' is a symbol consisting of a muscular [[arm]] holding a [[hammer]].  Used in ancient times as a symbol of the god [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], it came to be known as a symbol of [[industry]], for example [[blacksmithing]] and [[gold-beating]]. It has been used as a symbol by many different kinds of organizations, including banks, local government, and [[socialist]] political parties. 

It has been used in [[heraldry]], appearing in the [[Coat of arms of Birmingham]] and [[Seal of Wisconsin]].

The similarity to the name of the industrialist [[Armand Hammer]] is not a coincidence: he was named after the symbol, as his father Julius Hammer was a supporter of socialist causes, including the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]], with its arm-and-hammer logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2.489/.premium-1.690726|title=1990: Armand Hammer, Who Was Named for the Symbol of Socialism, Dies - This Day in Jewish History - Haaretz|website=www.haaretz.com|access-date=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arm &amp; Hammer (brand)|Arm &amp; Hammer]] brand is a registered trademark of [[Church &amp; Dwight]], an American manufacturer of household products. According to the company, the logo originally represented Vulcan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.trivia-library.com/a/history-of-product-names-and-trademarks-arm-and-hammer-baking-soda.htm|title=History of Product Names &amp; Trademarks: Arm &amp; Hammer Baking Soda|website=www.trivia-library.com|access-date=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Armand Hammer made an offer to outright purchase this company having this brand with the similarity to his name, and while this offer was refused, he eventually acquired enough stock to have a controlling interest and join the board of directors.  He remained an owner until his death in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/182/did-tycoon-armand-hammer-have-anything-to-do-with-arm-hammer-baking-soda|title=Did tycoon Armand Hammer have anything to do with Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda?|website=www.straightdope.com|date=1982-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An arm-and-hammer sign can be seen in [[Manette Street]], [[Soho]], symbolizing the trade of gold-beating carried on there in the nineteenth century. It is referred to by Charles Dickens in ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"In a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane tree rustled its green leaves, church organs claimed to be made, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall... as if he had beaten himself precious." &amp;ndash; ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', Charles Dickens&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, the sign there is a replica, with the original being held in the [[Dickens Museum]].&lt;ref name=londonenc&gt;{{Cite book|title=The London Encyclopaedia (3rd Edition)|last=Hibbert|first=Christopher|last2=Weinreb|first2=Ben|publisher=Macmillan|year=2010|isbn=9781405049252|location=|pages=524|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2974">A '''battle of egos''' is a phrase used [[metaphor]]ically to describe competitions that are based on [[pride]] and often entail prodigious and arrogant demonstrations of prowess. A type of [[duel]]ing similar to a [[pissing contest]], [[Id,_ego_and_super-ego#Ego|ego]] battles are often seen as an arrogant way to determine who is the "bigger man" (as far as being superior right in an argument) by a competitive [[methodology]] that is not especially productive. The [[idiom]] is usually used [[Literal and figurative language|figurative]]ly and often refer to forms of [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]-driven battling in a [[pejorative]] manner.

==Ego battles==
A [[Tehran]] newspaper described the dispute between [[George W. Bush]] and [[Saddam Hussein]] as a battle of egos.&lt;ref&gt;"In the battle of egos between (George W.) Bush and Saddam (Hussein), it seems that the real losers will be the citizens of Iraq and the United States."

Call it grandstanding. Call it egomania. Some 30 advertisers, from Pepsi to the National Pork Producers Council, are going to strut their commercial stuff in hopes of at least getting noticed by most of the 135 million TV viewers Jan. 29. But advertisers who go to the Super Bowl without a real message will quickly discover they're not going to win new customers, warns Charles Brymer, CEO of Interbrand, a corporate image company."

Taking a [[behavior informatics]] perspective, a behavior consists of behavior actor, operation, interactions, and their properties. A behavior can be represented as a behavior vector.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cao|first=Longbing|date=|year=2010|title=In-depth Behavior Understanding and Use: the Behavior Informatics Approach|url=|journal=Information Science|volume=180|issue=17|pages=3067–3085|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is some disagreement as to how to precisely define behavior in a biological context, one common interpretation based on a meta-analysis of scientific literature states that "behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of whole living organisms (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levitis|first=Daniel |author2=William Z. Lidicker, Jr |author3=Glenn Freund|title=Behavioural biologists do not agree on what constitutes behaviour|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=June 2009|volume=78|pages=103–10|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.03.018 |url=http://academic.reed.edu/biology/courses/bio342/2010_syllabus/2010_readings/levitis_etal_2009.pdf|pmc=2760923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A broader definition of behavior, applicable to plants and other organisms, is similar to the concept of [[phenotypic plasticity]]. It describes behavior as a response to an event or environment change during the course of the lifetime of an individual, differing from other physiological or biochemical changes that occurs more rapidly, and excluding changes that are result of development ([[ontogeny]]).&lt;ref&gt;Karban, R. (2008). Plant behaviour and communication. ''Ecology Letters'' 11 (7): 727–739, [http://169.237.77.3/news/PlantBehavior.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004074635/http://169.237.77.3/news/PlantBehavior.pdf |date=4 October 2015 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karban, R. (2015). Plant Behavior and Communication. In: ''Plant Sensing and Communication''.

Behaviors can be either [[innate]] or learned from the environment.

Behavior can be regarded as any action of an organism that changes its relationship to its environment. Behavior provides outputs from the organism to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Dusenbery, David B.

===Human behavior===
{{Main|Human behavior}}

Human behavior is believed to be influenced by the [[endocrine system]] and the [[nervous system]]. It is most commonly believed that complexity in the behavior of an organism is correlated to the complexity of its nervous system. Generally, organisms with more complex nervous systems have a greater capacity to [[learn]] new responses and thus adjust their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Book of Alan: A Universal Order|last=Gregory|first=Alan|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=978-1-5144-2053-9|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer behavior==

'''Consumers behavior'''

[[Consumer behavior]] refers to the processes consumers go through, and reactions they have towards products or services&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dowhan|first=David|date=June 1, 2013|title=Hitting Your Target|url=Retrieved from http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=f98b06cd-8924-4f6d-89f8-245bde9615f8%40sessionmgr198&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=124|journal=Marketing Insights|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-03-30}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Dowhan, 2013). It is to do with consumption, and the processes consumers go through around purchasing and consuming goods and services&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Szwacka-Mokrzycka|first=Joanna|date=2015|title=TRENDS IN CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR CHANGES. OVERVIEW OF CONCEPTS.|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=83b2b7c5-d287-4702-8baf-b8b9d6665410%40sessionmgr4004&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4112&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl&amp;preview=false#AN=112782281&amp;db=bth|journal=Acta Scientiarum Polonorum.

Consumers recognise needs or wants, and go through a process to satisfy these needs. Consumer behavior is the process they go through as customers, which includes types of products purchased, amount spent, frequency of purchases and what influences them to make the purchase decision or not. There is a lot that influences consumer behavior, with contributions from both internal and external factors&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (Szwacka-Mokrzycka, 2015). Internal factors include attitudes, needs, motives, preferences and perceptual processes, whilst external factors include marketing activities, social and economic factors, and cultural aspects&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (Szwacka-Mokrzycka, 2015). Doctor Lars Perner of the University of Southern California claims that there are also physical factors that influence consumer behavior, for example if a consumer is hungry, then this physical feeling of hunger will influence them so that they go and purchase a sandwich to satisfy the hunger&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.consumerpsychologist.com/intro_Consumer_Behavior.html|title=Consumer Behaviour|last=Perner|first=Lars|date=2008|website=Consumer Psychologist|publisher=|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Perner, 2008).

'''Consumer decision making'''

There is a model described by Lars Perner which illustrates the decision making process with regards to consumer behavior. It begins with recognition of a problem, the consumer recognises a need or want which has not been satisfied. This leads the consumer to search for information, if it is a low involvement product then the search will be internal, identifying alternatives purely from memory. If the product is high involvement then the search be more thorough, such as reading reviews or reports or asking friends. The consumer will then evaluate his or her alternatives, comparing price, quality, doing trade-offs between products and narrowing down the choice by eliminating the less appealing products until there is one left. After this has been identified, the consumer will purchase the product. Finally the consumer will evaluate the purchase decision, and the purchased product, bringing in factors such as value for money, quality of goods and purchase experience&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (Model taken from Perner, 2008).

'''How the 4P's influence consumer behavior'''

The [[Marketing mix|4 P's]] are a marketing tool, and stand for Price, Promotion, Product and Place or Product Placement&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clemons|first=Eric|date=2008|title=How Information Changes Consumer Behavior and How Consumer Behavior Determines Corporate Strategy|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=32c58928-1d36-4594-90d4-e5f7569a77f1%40sessionmgr198&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=116&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl&amp;preview=false#AN=34879420&amp;db=bth|journal=Journal of Management Information Systems|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Clemons, 2008).  Consumer behavior is influenced greatly by business to consumer marketing, so being a prominent marketing tool, the 4 P's will have an effect on consumer's behavior. The price of a good or service is largely determined by the market, as businesses will set their prices to be similar to that of other business so as to remain competitive whilst making a profit&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; (Clemons, 2008). When market prices for a product are high, it will cause consumers to purchase less and use purchased goods for longer periods of time, meaning they are purchasing the product less often. Alternatively, when market prices for a product are low, consumers are more likely to purchase more of the product, and more often. The way that promotion influences consumer behavior has changed over time. In the past, large promotional campaigns and lots of advertising would convert into sales for a business, but nowadays businesses can have success on products with little or no advertising&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; (Clemons, 2008). This is due to the internet, and in particular social media. They rely on word of mouth from consumers using social media, and as products trend online, so sales increase as products effectively promote themselves&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; (Clemons, 2008). Thus, promotion by businesses does not necessarily result in consumer behavior trending towards purchasing products.  The way that product influences consumer behavior is through consumer willingness to pay, and consumer preferences&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; (Clemons, 2008). This means that even if a company were to have a long history of products in the market, consumers will still pick a cheaper product over the company in question's product if it means they will pay less for something that is very similar&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; (Clemons, 2008). This is due to consumer willingness to pay, or their willingness to part with their money they have earned. Product also influences consumer behavior through customer preferences. For example, take Pepsi vs Coca-Cola, a Pepsi drinker is less likely to purchase Coca-Cola, even if it is cheaper and more convenient. This is due to the preference of the consumer, and no matter how hard the opposing company tries they will not be able to force the customer to change their mind. Product placement in the modern era has little influence on consumer behavior, due to the availability of goods online&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; (Clemons, 2008). If a customer can purchase a good from the comfort of their home instead of purchasing in-store, then the placement of products is not going to influence their purchase decision.

==In management==

'''Behavior outside of psychology includes''':

===Organizational===

In management, behaviors are associated with desired or undesired focuses.  Managers generally note what the desired outcome is, but behavioral patterns can take over.  These patterns are the reference to how often the desired behavior actually occurs.  Before a behavior actually occurs, antecedents focus on the stimuli that influence the behavior that is about to happen.  After the behavior occurs, consequences fall into place.  Consequences consist of rewards or punishments.

===Social behavior===
{{Main|Social behavior}}

== Behavior informatics ==
[[Behavior informatics]]&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; also called [[behavior computing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Behavior Computing: Modeling, Analysis, Mining and Decision|last=Cao|first=L.|last2=Yu|first2=P. (eds)|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4471-2969-1|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; explores behavior intelligence and behavior insights from the informatics and computing perspectives.

==Health==

{{See also|Health belief model|Theory of planned behavior|Transtheoretical model|Self-efficacy}}
Health behavior refers to a person's beliefs and actions regarding their health and [[well-being]]. Health behaviors are direct factors in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Health behaviors are influenced by the social, cultural and physical environments in which we live and work. They are shaped by individual choices and external constraints. Positive behaviors help promote health and prevent disease, while the opposite is true for risk behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-229-x/2009001/deter/int3-eng.htm|title=Health behaviours|author=|date=11 January 2010|work=statcan.gc.ca|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health behaviors are early indicators of population health. Because of the time lag that often occurs between certain behaviors and the development of disease, these indicators may foreshadow the future burdens and benefits of health-risk and health-promoting behaviors. Health behaviors do not occur in isolation—they are influenced and constrained by social and cultural norms.

===Correlates===

A variety of studies have examined the relationship between health behaviors and health outcomes (e.g., Blaxter 1990) and have demonstrated their role in both morbidity and mortality.

These studies have identified seven features of lifestyle which were associated with lower morbidity and higher subsequent long-term survival (Belloc and Breslow 1972):
* Avoiding snacks
* Eating  breakfast regularly
* Exercising regularly
* Maintaining a desirable body weight
* Moderate alcohol intake
* Not smoking
* Sleeping 7–8h per night

Health behaviors impact upon individuals' quality of life, by delaying the onset of chronic disease and extending active lifespan. Smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, gaps in primary care services and low screening uptake are all significant determinants of poor health, and changing such behaviors should lead to improved health.
For example, in USA, Healthy People 2000, [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (USDHHS), lists increased physical activity, changes in nutrition and reductions in tobacco, alcohol and drug use as important for health promotion and disease prevention.

===Treatment approach===

Any interventions done are matched with the needs of each individual in an ethical and respected manner. [[Health belief model|HBM]] encourages increasing individuals' perceived susceptibility to negative health outcomes and making individuals aware of the severity of such negative health behavior outcomes. E.g. through health promotion messages. In addition, the HBM suggests the need to focus on the benefits of health behaviors and the fact that barriers to action are easily overcome. The [[theory of planned behavior]] (TPB) suggests using persuasive messages for tackling behavioral beliefs to increase the readiness to perform a behavior, called ''intentions''. TPB advocates the need to tackle normative beliefs and control beliefs in any attempt to change behavior. Challenging the normative beliefs isn't enough but to follow through the ''intention'' with self-efficacy from individual's mastery in problem solving and task completion is important to bring about a positive change.&lt;ref&gt;Gollwitzer 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Self efficacy is often cemented through standard persuasive techniques.

'''Beneficence''' is a concept in [[research ethics]] which states that researchers should have the welfare of the research participant as a goal of any [[clinical trial]] or other research study. The [[antonym]] of this term, '''maleficence''', describes a practice which opposes the welfare of any research participant.

The concept that medical professionals and researchers would always practice beneficence seems natural to most patients and research participants, but in fact, every [[health intervention]] or research intervention has potential to harm the recipient. There are many different precedents in medicine and research for conducting a [[cost–benefit analysis]] and judging whether a certain action would be a sufficient practice of beneficence, and the extent to which treatments are acceptable or unacceptable is under debate.

Despite differences in opinion, there are many concepts on which there is wide agreement. One is that there should be community consensus when determining [[best practices]] for dealing with ethical problems.

==Elements==
These four concepts often arise in discussions about beneficence:
#one should not practice evil or do harm, often stated in [[Latin]] as ''[[Primum non nocere]]''
#one should prevent evil or harm
#one should remove evil or harm
#one should practice good

Ordinary moral discourse and most philosophical systems state that a prohibition on doing harm to others as in #1 is more compelling than any duty to benefit others as in #2–4. This makes the concept of "first do no harm" different from the other aspects of beneficence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross|first=W.D.|title=The Right and the Good|year=1988|publisher=Hackett Pub. Co.|location=Indianapolis|isbn=978-0-87220-058-6|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example illustrating this concept is the [[trolley problem]].

Morality and ethical theory allows for judging relative costs, so in the case when a harm to be inflicted in violating #1 is negligible and the harm prevented or benefit gained in #2–4 is substantial, then it may be acceptable to cause one harm to gain another benefit. Academic literature discusses different variations of such scenarios. There is no objective evidence which dictates the best course of action when health professionals and researchers disagree about the best course of action for participants except that most people agree that the discussions about ethics should happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Robert J.|title=Ethics and Regulation of Clinical Research|year=1988|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=978-0-300-04288-7|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problem==
Some outstanding problems in discussing beneficence occur repeatedly. Researchers often describe these problems in the following categories:

===To what extent should the benefactor suffer harm for the beneficiary?===
Many people share the view that when it is trivial to do so, people should help each other. The situation becomes more complicated when one person can help another by making various degrees of personal sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graff|first=James A.|title=Human Acts, an Essay in their Moral Evaluation by Eric D'Arcy, The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1963, 174p. $4.50.|journal=Dialogue|year=1963|volume=3|issue=3|pages=311–2|doi=10.1017/S0012217300035460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===To whom are duties of beneficence owed?===
Researchers should apply the concept of beneficence to individuals within the patient/physician relationship or the research-participant/researcher relationship. However, there is debate about the extent to which the interests of other parties, such as future patients and endangered persons, ought to be considered. When a researcher risks harm to a willing volunteer to do research with the intent to develop knowledge which will better humanity, this may be a practice of beneficence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=King|first1=Ruth R. |last2= Faden |first2= Tom L.

The '''binding problem''' is a term used at the interface between [[neuroscience]], [[cognitive science]] and [[philosophy of mind]] that has multiple meanings.

Firstly, there is the '''segregation problem''': a practical computational problem of how brains segregate elements in complex patterns of [[sensory perception|sensory input]] so that they are allocated to discrete "objects". In other words, when looking at a blue square and a yellow circle, what neural mechanisms ensure that the square is perceived as blue and the circle as yellow, and not vice versa? The segregation problem is sometimes called BP1.

Secondly, there is the '''combination problem''':The problem of how objects, background and abstract or emotional features are combined into a single experience.&lt;ref name="Revonsuo 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Revonsuo | first1 = A. | last2 = Newman | first2 = J. | title = Binding and consciousness. | journal = Conscious Cogn | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–7 |date=Jun 1999 | doi = 10.1006/ccog.1999.0393 | PMID = 10447994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination problem is sometimes called BP2.

However, the difference between these two problems is not always clear. Moreover, the historical literature is often ambiguous as to whether it is addressing the segregation or the combination problem.&lt;ref name="Revonsuo 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smythies 1994"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Smythies | first1 = John R. (John Raymond) | title = The walls of Plato's cave : the science and philosophy of (brain, consciousness, and perception | year = 1994 | publisher = Avebury | location = Aldershot ; Brookfield, USA | isbn = 978-1-85628-882-8 | oclc = 30156912 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The segregation problem==

===Definition===
The segregation problem is the problem of how brains segregate elements in complex patterns of sensory input so that they are allocated to discrete "objects".&lt;ref name="Smythies 1994"/&gt;

Smythies defined BP1 in these terms: "How is the representation of information built up in the [[neural network]]s that there is one single object 'out there' and not a mere collection of separate shapes, colours and movements?"&lt;ref name="Smythies 1994"/&gt; Revonsuo refers to this as the problem of "stimulus-related binding" – of sorting stimuli. Although usually referred to as a problem of binding, the computational problem is arguably one of discrimination.&lt;ref name="Revonsuo 1999"/&gt; Thus, in the words of Canales et al.: "to bind together all the features of one object and segregate them from features of other objects and the background".&lt;ref name="Canales 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Canales | first1 = AF. | last2 = Gómez | first2 = DM. | last3 = Maffet | first3 = CR. | title = A critical assessment of the consciousness by synchrony hypothesis. | journal = Biol Res | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 517–9 | month =  | year = 2007 | doi =  10.4067/S0716-97602007000500012 | PMID = 18575683 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bartels and Zeki  describe it as "determining that it is the same (or a different) stimulus which is activating different cells in a given visual area or in different visual areas".&lt;ref name="Bartels 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bartels | first1 = A. | last2 = Zeki | first2 = S. | title = The temporal order of binding visual attributes. | journal = Vision Res | volume = 46 | issue = 14 | pages = 2280–6 | date = Jul 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.visres.2005.11.017 | PMID = 16387344 | url = http://www.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/files/publications/Bartels2006_visualBinding_%5B0%5D.pdf }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental work===
Most experimental work is on vision, where it is known that humans and other mammals process different aspects of [[perception]] by separating information about those aspects and processing them in distinct regions of the brain. For example, Bartels and Zeki have shown that different areas in the [[visual cortex]] specialize in processing the different aspects of [[color vision|colour]], [[motion perception|motion]], and [[shape]]. This type of modular coding has been claimed to yield a potential for [[ambiguity]]. When humans view a scene containing a blue square and a yellow circle, some neurons signal in response to blue, others signal in response to yellow, still others to a square shape or a circle shape. Here, the binding problem is the issue of how the brain correctly pairs colour and shape, i.e. indicates that blue goes with square, rather than yellow.&lt;ref name="Bartels 2006"/&gt;

===Synchronization theory===
A popular hypothesis perhaps first suggested by Milner has been that features of individual objects are bound/segregated via [[neural oscillation|synchronisation]] of the activity of different neurons in the cortex.&lt;ref name="Milner 1974"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Milner PM |title=A model for visual shape recognition |journal=Psychol Rev |volume=81 |issue=6 |pages=521–35 |date=November 1974 |pmid=4445414 |doi=10.1037/h0037149 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shadlen 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shadlen MN, Movshon JA |title=Synchrony unbound: a critical evaluation of the temporal binding hypothesis |journal=Neuron |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=67–77, 111–25 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10677027 |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80822-3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is that when two feature-neurons fire synchronously they are bound, while when they fire out of synchrony they are unbound. Empirical testing of the idea was given impetus when von der Malsburg  proposed that feature binding posed a special problem that could not be covered simply by cellular firing rates.&lt;ref&gt;von der Malsburg, C. (1981). The correlation theory of brain function. MPI Biophysical Chemistry, Internal Report 81–2. Reprinted in Mod- els of Neural Networks II (1994), E. Domany, J.L. van Hemmen, and K. Schulten, eds. (Berlin: Springer).&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies suggested that there is indeed a relationship between rhythmic synchronous firing and feature binding. This rhythmic firing appears to be linked to intrinsic oscillations in neuronal somatic potentials, typically in the [[gamma wave|gamma range]] close to 40&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="Engel 1990"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Engel AK, König P, Gray CM, Singer W |title=Stimulus-Dependent Neuronal Oscillations in Cat Visual Cortex: Inter-Columnar Interaction as Determined by Cross-Correlation Analysis |journal=Eur.

The positive arguments for a role for rhythmic synchrony in resolving the segregational object-feature binding problem (BP1) have been summarized by Singer.&lt;ref name="Singer 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singer|first1=Wolf|title=Binding by synchrony| journal=Scholarpedia| volume=2| issue=12| year=2007|pages=1657|issn=1941-6016|doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1657}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is certainly extensive evidence for synchronization of neural firing as part of responses to visual stimuli. However, there is inconsistency between findings from different laboratories. Moreover, a number of recent reviewers, including Shadlen and Movshon&lt;ref name="Shadlen 1999"/&gt; and Merker&lt;ref name="Merker 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Merker B |title=Cortical gamma oscillations: the functional key is activation, not cognition |journal=Neurosci Biobehav Rev |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=401–17 |date=March 2013 |pmid=23333264 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.01.013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have raised concerns.

Shadlen and Movshon,&lt;ref name="Shadlen 1999"/&gt; raise a series of doubts about both the theoretical and the empirical basis for the idea of segregational binding by temporal synchrony. Firstly, it is not clear that binding does pose a special computational problem of the sort proposed by von der Malsburg. Secondly, it is unclear how synchrony would come to play a distinct role in terms of local computational logic. Thirdly, it is difficult to envisage a situation in which pre-synaptic firing rate and synchrony could be usefully interpreted independently by a post-synaptic cell, since the two are interdependent over plausible time scales.

Another point that has been raised is that within standard time frames for neuronal firing very few distinct phases of synchrony would be distinguishable even under optimal conditions&lt;!--[15]--&gt;.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} However, this would only be significant if the same pathways are potentially fed spike (signal) trains in multiple phases. In contrast, Seth&lt;ref name="Seth 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seth|first1=A. K.|title=Visual Binding Through Reentrant Connectivity and Dynamic Synchronization in a Brain-based Device|journal=Cerebral Cortex| volume=14| issue=11| year=2004| pages=1185–1199|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhh079| pmid=15142952}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes an artificial brain-based robot that demonstrates multiple, separate, widely distributed neural circuits, firing at different phases, suggesting that synchrony may assist the establishment of discrete object-related re-entrant circuits in a system exposed to randomly timed stimuli.

Goldfarb and Treisman&lt;ref name="Goldfarb 2013"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Goldfarb | first1 = L. | last2 = Treisman | first2 = A. | title = Counting multidimensional objects: implications for the neural-synchrony theory. | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 266–71 |date=Mar 2013 | doi = 10.1177/0956797612459761 | PMID = 23334446 }}&lt;/ref&gt; point out that a logical problem appears to arise for binding solely via synchrony if there are several objects that share some of their features and not others. When viewing a display of variously coloured letters, internal representation of a red X, a green O, a red O and a green X cannot be accounted for purely by synchrony of signals for red and X shape, for instance. At best synchrony can facilitate segregation supported by other means (as von der Malsburg acknowledges&lt;ref name="von der Malsburg 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = von der Malsburg | first1 = C. | title = The what and why of binding: the modeler's perspective. | journal = Neuron | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 95–104, 111–25 |date=Sep 1999 | url = http://cogprints.org/1488/5/cvdm.pdf | PMID = 10677030 | doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(00)80825-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

A number of neuropsychological studies suggest that the association of colour, shape and movement as "features of an object" is not simply a matter of linking or "binding". Purves and Lotto&lt;ref&gt;Purves, D. and Lotto, R. B. (2003) Why we see what we do: An empirical theory of vision. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; give extensive evidence for top-down feedback signals that ensure that sensory data are handled as features of (sometimes wrongly) postulated objects early in processing. In many illusions data appear as if pre-consciously adjusted in accordance with object expectations. Pylyshyn&lt;ref name="Pylyshyn 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Pylyshyn | first1 = ZW. | title = Visual indexes, preconceptual objects, and situated vision. | journal = Cognition | volume = 80 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 127–58 |date=Jun 2001 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-0277(00)00156-6 | PMID = 11245842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has also emphasized the way the brain seems to pre-conceive objects to which features are to be allocated and which are attributed continuing existence even if features, like color  change.

===Feature integration theory===
In her [[feature integration theory]], [[Anne Treisman|Treisman]] suggested that binding between features is mediated by the features' links to a common location. Psychophysical demonstrations of binding failures under conditions of full [[attention]] provide support for the idea that binding is accomplished through common location tags.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Treisman, A. |author2=Gelade, G. |year=1980 |title=A feature integration theory of attention. |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=97–136 |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(80)90005-5 |pmid=7351125 |url=http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/class/Psy355/Gilden/treisman.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905025042/http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/class/Psy355/Gilden/treisman.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
An implication of these approaches is that sensory data such as colour or motion may not normally exist in "unallocated" form. For Merker:&lt;ref name="Merker 2013"/&gt; "The 'red' of a red ball does not float disembodied in an abstract color space in V4." If colour information allocated to a point in the visual field is converted directly, via the instantiation of some form of propositional logic (analogous to that used in computer design) into colour information allocated to an "object identity" postulated by a top-down signal as suggested by Purves and Lotto, (e.g. There is blue here + Object 1 is here = Object 1 is blue) no special computational task of "binding together" by means such as synchrony may exist. (Although Von der Malsburg&lt;!--[18]--&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} poses the problem in terms of binding "propositions" such as "triangle" and "top", these, in isolation, are not propositional.)

How signals in the brain come to have propositional content, or meaning, is a much larger issue. However, both Marr&lt;ref&gt;Marr, D. C. (1982) Vision. New York, Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; and Barlow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barlow | first1 = H. | year = 1972 | title = Single units and sensation: A neuron doctrine for perceptual psychology? | url = | journal = Perception | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 371–394 | doi=10.1068/p010371}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested, on the basis of what was known about neural connectivity in the 1970s that the final integration of features into a percept would be expected to resemble the way words operate in sentences.

The role of synchrony in segregational binding remains controversial. Merker&lt;ref name="Merker 2013"/&gt; has recently suggested that synchrony may be a feature of areas of activation in the brain that relates to an "infrastructural" feature of the computational system analogous to increased oxygen demand indicated via MRI. Apparent specific correlations with segregational tasks may be explainable on the basis of interconnectivity of the areas involved. As a possible manifestation of a need to balance excitation and inhibition over time it might be expected to be associated with reciprocal re-entrant circuits as in the model of Seth et al.&lt;ref name="Seth 2004"/&gt; (Merker gives the analogy of the whistle from an audio amplifier receiving its own output.)

If it transpires that synchronized activity plays at most an infrastructural role in segregative computational "binding", the question arises as to whether we need another explanation. The implication both of Shadlen and Movshon's and of Merker's analyses seems to be that there may be no special binding problem in this sense. The problem may be merely an integral part of the more general problem of the computational logic used by neurons, or what is often referred to as the "neural code". In particular it may be inappropriate to analyse binding in perception without taking into account the way features are bound in memory, as addressed by Zimmer and colleagues,&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, H.D., Mecklinger, A. and Lindenberger, U. (2006) Binding in human memory: A neurocognitive approach. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and how that informs the way the brain pre-conceives objects&lt;!--[19,20]--&gt;.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==The combination problem==

===Definition===
[[John Raymond Smythies|Smythies]]&lt;ref name="Smythies 1994"/&gt; defines BP2 as "How do the brain mechanisms actually construct the phenomenal object?". Revonsuo&lt;ref name="Revonsuo 1999"/&gt; equates this to "[[consciousness]]-related binding", emphasizing the entailment of a phenomenal aspect. As Revonsuo explores in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Revonsuo, A, (2006) Inner Presence: Consciousness as a biological phenomenon. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; there are nuances of difference beyond the basic BP1:BP2 division. Smythies speaks of constructing a phenomenal object ("local unity" for Revonsuo) but philosophers such as Descartes, Leibniz, Kant and James (see Brook and Raymont&lt;ref&gt;The Unity of Consciousness. Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-unity/&lt;/ref&gt;) have typically been concerned with the broader unity of a phenomenal experience ("global unity" for Revonsuo) – which, as Bayne&lt;ref name="Bayne"&gt;Bayne, T. and Chalmers, D. (2003) What is the unity of consciousness? In Cleeremans, A. The Unity of consciousness, Binding, Integration and Dissociation, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates may involve features as diverse as seeing a book, hearing a tune and feeling an emotion. Further discussion will focus on this more general problem of how sensory data that may have been segregated into, for instance, "blue square" and "yellow circle" are to be re-combined into a single phenomenal experience of a blue square next to a yellow circle, plus all other features of their context. There are a wide range of views on just how real this "unity" is, but the existence of medical conditions in which it appears to be subjectively impaired, or at least restricted, suggests that it is not entirely illusory&lt;!--[26]--&gt;.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===History===
Early philosophers such as [[Descartes]] and [[Leibniz]]&lt;!--[26]--&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} noted that the apparent unity of our experience is an all-or-none qualitative characteristic that does not appear to have an equivalent in the known quantitative features, like proximity or cohesion, of composite matter. [[William James]]&lt;!--[5]--&gt;,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} in the nineteenth century, considered the ways the unity of consciousness might be explained by known physics and found no satisfactory answer. He coined the term "combination problem", in the specific context of a "mind-dust theory" in which it is proposed that a full human conscious experience is built up from proto- or micro-experiences in the way that matter is built up from atoms. James claimed that such a theory was incoherent, since no causal physical account could be given of how distributed proto-experiences would "combine". He favoured instead a concept of "co-consciousness" in which there is one "experience of A, B and C" rather than combined experiences. A detailed discussion of subsequent philosophical positions is given by Brook and Raymont (see 26). However, these do not generally include physical interpretations. James&lt;!--[5]--&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} remained concerned about the absence of a "single physical thing", other than an atom, that could be co-conscious (of A, B and C), echoing Leibniz.

[[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1929) Process and Reality. 1979 corrected edition, edited by David Ray Griffin and Donald W. Sherburne, Free Press. {{ISBN|0-02-934570-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a fundamental ontological basis for a relation consistent with James's idea of co-consciousness, in which many causal elements are co-available or "compresent" in a single event or "occasion" that constitutes a unified experience. Whitehead did not give physical specifics but the idea of compresence is framed in terms of causal convergence in a local interaction consistent with physics. Where Whitehead goes beyond anything formally recognized in physics is in the "chunking" of causal relations into complex but discrete "occasions". Even if such occasions can be defined, Whitehead's approach still leaves James's difficulty with finding a site, or sites, of causal convergence that would make neurobiological sense for "co-consciousness". Sites of signal convergence do clearly exist throughout the brain but there is a concern to avoid re-inventing what [[Daniel Dennett|Dennett]]&lt;ref name="Dennett"&gt;Dennett, D.C. (1978) Brainstorms (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press)&lt;/ref&gt; calls a Cartesian Theater or single central site of convergence of the form that Descartes proposed.

Descartes's central "soul" is now rejected because neural activity closely correlated with conscious perception is widely distributed throughout the cortex. The remaining choices appear to be either separate involvement of multiple distributed causally convergent events or a model that does not tie a phenomenal experience to any specific local physical event but rather to some overall "functional" capacity. Whichever interpretation is taken, as Revonsuo&lt;ref name="Revonsuo 1999"/&gt; indicates, there is no consensus on what structural level we are dealing with – whether the cellular level, that of cellular groups as "nodes", "complexes" or "assemblies" or that of widely distributed networks. There is probably only general agreement that it is not the level of the whole brain, since there is evidence that signals in certain primary sensory areas, such as the V1 region of the visual cortex (in addition to motor areas and cerebellum), do not contribute directly to phenomenal experience.

===Modern theories===
Dennett&lt;ref name="Dennett"/&gt; has proposed that our sense that our experiences are single events is illusory and that, instead, at any one time there are "multiple drafts" of sensory patterns at multiple sites. Each would only cover a fragment of what we think we experience. Arguably, Dennett is claiming that consciousness is not unified and there is no phenomenal binding problem. Most philosophers have difficulty with this position (see Bayne&lt;ref name="Bayne"/&gt;). Dennett's view might be in keeping with evidence from recall experiments and change blindness purporting to show that our experiences are much less rich than we sense them to be – what has been called the Grand Illusion.&lt;ref&gt;Blackmore, S. J., Brelstaff, G., Nelson, K., Troscianko, T. (1995), "Is the richness of our visual world an illusion? Transsaccadic memory for complex scenes", Perception, 24, pp. 1075–81.&lt;/ref&gt; However, few, if any, other authors suggest the existence of multiple partial "drafts". Moreover, also on the basis of recall experiments, Lamme&lt;ref name="Lamme"&gt;Lamme, V. (2002) The grand Grand Illusion illusion. Journal of Consciousness Studies, 9, 141–157.&lt;/ref&gt; has challenged the idea that richness is illusory, emphasizing that phenomenal content cannot be equated with content to which there is cognitive access.

Dennett does not tie drafts to biophysical events. Multiple sites of causal convergence are invoked in specific biophysical terms by Edwards&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J. C. (2005) Is consciousness only a property of individual cells? Journal of Consciousness Studies 12, 4-5, 60–76. Available at http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jonathan-edwards&lt;/ref&gt; and Sevush.&lt;ref&gt;Sevush, S. (2006) Single neuron theory of consciousness. J. Theoretical Biology 238, 704–725.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view the sensory signals to be combined in phenomenal experience are available, in full, at each of multiple sites. To avoid non-causal combination each site/event is placed within an individual neuronal dendritic tree. The advantage is that "compresence" is invoked just where convergence occurs neuro-anatomically. The disadvantage, as for Dennett, is the counter-intuitive concept of multiple "copies" of experience. The precise nature of an experiential event or "occasion", even if local, also remains uncertain.

The majority of theoretical frameworks for the unified richness of phenomenal experience adhere to the intuitive idea that experience exists as a single copy, and draw on "functional" descriptions of distributed networks of cells. Baars&lt;ref&gt;Baars, B. J. (1997), In the Theater of Consciousness New York, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that certain signals, encoding what we experience, enter a "Global Workspace" within which they are "broadcast" to many sites in the cortex for parallel processing. Dehaene, Changeux and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene, S., Sergent, C. and Changeux, J.-P. (2003). A neuronal network model linking subjective reports and objective physiological data during conscious perception. Proc. National Academy of Science (USA) 100. 14: 8520–8525.&lt;/ref&gt; have developed a detailed neuro-anatomical version of such a workspace. Tononi and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Balduzzi D, Tononi G. (2008) Integrated information in discrete dynamical systems: motivation and theoretical framework. ''PLoS Comput Biol''. 4(6):e1000091. doi: 10.1371/ journal.pcbi.1000091&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the level of richness of an experience is determined by the narrowest information interface "bottleneck" in the largest sub-network or "complex" that acts as an integrated functional unit. Lamme&lt;ref name="Lamme"/&gt; has suggested that networks supporting reciprocal signaling rather than those merely involved in feed-forward signaling support experience. Edelman and colleagues have also emphasized the importance of re-entrant signaling&lt;!--[16]--&gt;.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Cleeremans&lt;ref&gt;Cleeremans, A. (2011) The radical plasticity thesis. Frontiers in Psychology 2, Article 86 {{DOI|10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00086}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizes meta-representation as the functional signature of signals contributing to consciousness.

In general, such network-based theories are not explicitly theories of how consciousness is unified, or "bound" but rather theories of functional domains within which signals contribute to unified conscious experience. A concern about functional domains is what Rosenberg&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, G. (2004) A Place for Consciousness. Oxford, Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-516814-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has called the boundary problem; it is hard to find a unique account of what is to be included and what excluded. Nevertheless, this is, if anything is, the consensus approach.

Within the network context, a role for synchrony has been invoked as a solution to the phenomenal binding problem as well as the computational one. In his book, [[The Astonishing Hypothesis]],&lt;ref&gt;Crick, F. (1995) The Astonishing Hypothesis. Scribner Paperback {{ISBN|0-684-80158-2}} {{ISBN|978-0684801582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crick appears to be offering a solution to BP2 as much as BP1. Even von der Malsburg,&lt;!--[19]--&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} introduces detailed computational arguments about object feature binding with remarks about a "psychological moment". The Singer group&lt;!--[14]--&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} also appear to be interested as much in the role of synchrony in phenomenal awareness as in computational segregation.

The apparent incompatibility of using synchrony to both segregate and unify might be explained by sequential roles. However, Merker&lt;ref name="Merker 2013"/&gt; points out what appears to be a contradiction in attempts to solve the phenomenal unification problem (BP2) in terms of a functional (effectively meaning computational) rather than a local biophysical, domain, in the context of synchrony.

Functional arguments for a role for synchrony are in fact underpinned by analysis of local biophysical events. However, Merker&lt;ref name="Merker 2013"/&gt; points out that the explanatory work is done by the downstream integration of synchronized signals in post-synaptic neurons: "It is, however, by no means clear what is to be understood by 'binding by synchrony' other than the threshold advantage conferred by synchrony at, and only at, sites of axonal convergence onto single dendritic trees..." In other words, although synchrony is proposed as a way of explaining binding on a distributed, rather than a convergent, basis the justification rests on what happens at convergence. Signals for two features are proposed as bound by synchrony because synchrony effects downstream convergent interaction. Any theory of phenomenal binding based on this sort of computational function would seem to follow the same principle. The phenomenality would entail convergence, if the computational function does.

Although BP1 and BP2 are different, this need not invalidate the assumption, implicit in many of the quoted models, that computational and phenomenal events, at least at some point in the sequence of events, parallel each other in some way. The difficulty remains in identifying what that way might be. Merker's&lt;ref name="Merker 2013"/&gt; analysis suggests that either (1) both computational and phenomenal aspects of binding are determined by convergence of signals on neuronal dendritic trees, or (2) that our intuitive ideas about the need for "binding" in a "holding together" sense in both computational and phenomenal contexts are misconceived. We may be looking for something extra that is not needed. Merker, for instance, argues that the homotopic connectivity of sensory pathways does the necessary work.

The nature of, and solution to, BP2 remains a matter of controversy.

A new study published in [[Psychological Review]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/rev/125/4/545|title=The emergence of polychronization and feature binding in a spiking neural network model of the primate ventral visual system|author1=Eguchi A.|author2=et al.,|date=2018|publisher=Psychological Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Interface Focus|''Interface Focus'']] 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rsfs.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/8/4/20180021.e-letters|author1=Isbister, J.|author2 = et al.| year = 2018|title=A new approach to solving the feature-binding problem in primate vision|work=|format=| publisher = The Royal Society| DOI=10.1098/rsfs.2018.0021}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[Royal Society|Royal Society's]] cross-disciplinary journal at the interface between the physical and life sciences, sheds new light on how the visual system may represent which features are bound together as part of the same object. 

The research team, [http://www.oftnai.org the Oxford Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oftnai.org |title=Oxford Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence|work=|format=|}} &lt;/ref&gt; , led by Dr [[Simon Stringer]] from [[University of Oxford]], performed bio-inspired [[Spiking neural network|Spiking Neural Network]] simulations of the primate ventral visual system to address this enduring question. By training the biophysical model on a set of visual stimuli, has been observed the emergence of a subpopulation of [[neurons]], called ''polychronous neuronal groups'' (PNG), that exhibits regularly repeating spatio-temporal patterns of spikes. The underlying phenomenon of such spatio-temporal patterns responses is known as polychronization&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/089976606775093882|title=Polychronization: computation with spikes|last=Izhikevich|first=EM,|date=2006|publisher=Neural Computation}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The main point of this proposed novel approach is that within these PNGs exist neurons, called ''binding neurons'', that learn to represent the hierarchical binding relationships between lower and higher level visual features at every spatial scale and across the entire visual field. These binding neurons have been firstly formulated by [[Christoph von der Malsburg]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(00)80825-9|title=The What and Why of Binding|last=von der Malsburg|first=Christoph,|date=1999|publisher=Cell Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; , however, it has not previously been shown how these neurons may develop naturally through a biologically plausible process of visually guided learning and self-organization of polychronous neuronal groups. This latest research describe that such binding neurons emerge automatically within the PNGs during visually training when key properties of the visual cortex are incorporated into the model. This finding is consistent with the hierarchical nature of primate vision depicted by John Duncan &amp; [[Glyn W. Humphreys]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;"A fully hierarchical representation is created by repeating segmentation at different levels of scale. Each structural unit, contained by its own boundary, is further subdivided into parts by the major boundaries within it. Thus, a human body may be subdivided into head, torso, and limbs, and a hand into palm and fingers. Such subdivision serves two purposes. The description of a structural unit at one level of scale (animal, letter, etc.) must depend heavily on the relations between the parts defined within it (as well as on properties such as colour or movement that may be common to the parts). Then, at the next level down, each part becomes a new structural unit to be further described with its own properties, defined among other things by the relations between its own subparts. At the top of the hierarchy may be a structural unit corresponding to the whole input scene, described with a rough set of properties (e.g. division into light sky above and dark ground below)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www2.psychology.uiowa.edu/faculty/hollingworth/prosem/Duncan_Humphreys_89_PR_VisualSearchStimulus.pdf|title=Visual Search and Stimulus Similarity|author1=Duncan J.|author2=Humphreys GW.|date=1989|publisher=Psychological Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, this hierarchy feature binding theory proposes that information about visual features at every spatial scale, including the binding relations between these features, would be projected upwards to the higher layers of the network, where spatial information would be available for readout by later brain systems to guide behavior. This mechanism has been called  the ''holographic principle''. Lastly, by representing the hierarchical binding relationships between visual features at every spatial scale across a visual scene, these kinds of binding neurons could underpin visual consciousness itself, the capacity of the visual brain to perceive and make sense of its visuospatial world. Therefore, this work may represent a significant advancement towards the future development of [[Artificial General Intelligence]] and [[Machine Consciousness]], opening up new perspectives on building machines endowed with human-level intelligence.&lt;ref&gt; {{Citeweb|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/intelligent-machines-are-starting-to-catch-up-ps2f5m0j6|date=August 2018|title=Intelligent machines are starting to catch up|publisher = The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6724">'''Bossnapping''' is a form of [[Lockout (industry)#Lock-in|lock-in]] where employees detain management in the workplace, often in protest against lay-offs and redundancies, and has especially been carried out in France. The term gained wide usage in the media following a series of bossnapping incidents in the spring of 2009 in France where workers used the tactic in the context of widespread labor unrest resulting from the [[late 2000s recession]].

These incidents resulted in a public call for an end to the practice by French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], despite public opinion polling which showed widespread sympathy for the protesters.

==Description==
The term 'bossnapping' began receiving widespread use in the media following a series of high-profile incidents in [[France]] in the spring of 2009 where managers were detained by their workers. In early March, 2009, workers in southwestern France held the Chief Executive Officer and Human Resources Director of [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony France]] overnight, demanding a better [[severance package]] for workers who had been laid off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Amble | first = Brian | title = Bossnapping | publisher = Management Issues | date = 2009-03-26 | url = http://www.management-issues.com/2009/3/26/blog/bossnapping.asp | accessdate = 2009-11-01 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091228112909/http://www.management-issues.com/2009/3/26/blog/bossnapping.asp | archivedate = 2009-12-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They barricaded the entrance to the facility with tree trunks, and held their hostages until the CEO agreed to a renegotiation of the severance package that laid-off workers were to receive. Later that month, workers at a pharmaceutical factory owned by [[3M]] in [[Pithiviers]] held their boss in his office demanding similar concessions for laid-off workers as well as protections for remaining workers whose jobs had not been cut. The workers claimed their actions were not intended to be aggressive, but were rather their "only currency." [[French police]] did not intervene in either the Sony or 3M incidents, in the expectation that each would be resolved peacefully, as they were in the end.&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Sacked French workers take to 'bossnapping' | publisher = Agence France-Presse | date = 2009-03-25 | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jIIM90WyRdtmDowkRXClzkxsM7Xg | accessdate = 2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workers in the 3M incident provided a dinner of mussels and French Fries to their kidnapped boss while he was being held.&lt;ref name="jacard"/&gt;

In May 2010, workers of a [[Caterpillar Inc.]] plant in Grenoble took five managers as hostages to enforce negotiations about 733 job losses.&lt;ref&gt;sueddeutsche.de 17. May 2010: [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/frankreich-manager-als-geisel-ab-jetzt-ein-trend-1.406947 Ab jetzt ein Trend ]&lt;/ref&gt; They ended their doing after 10 hours when policemen began to record the names of the participating people.&lt;ref name="sz1"&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/arbeitnehmeraufstand-in-frankreich-flammender-protest-1.389727 Flammender Protest]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same month, about 300 workers of a Toyota factory in [[Onnaing]] (Northern France) blocked all entrances and hindered all trucks to leave the premises.&lt;ref name="sz1" /&gt;

Further bossnappings took place in a worksite of [[Hewlett-Packard]] in France and a lock-in of managers occurred at market research firm [[Synovate]] in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] as a part of a labor dispute during a contract renegotiation there.&lt;ref name="jacard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Locked out call-centre staff lock managers in | publisher = New Zealand Herald | date = 2009-04-14 | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10566554 | accessdate = 2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wave of high-profile incidents led to publication of advice for managers who might be bossnapped, although news reports made clear that the hostages had been treated well by their bossnappers. This advice included the preparation of special bossnapping kits that included a change of clothes and a cell phone pre-programmed with numbers of family members, police, and a psychologist who might assist with the psychological stress caused by being the hostage in such an incident.&lt;ref name="jacard"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Jacard | first = Alain | title = Bossnapping Wave Sweeps France | publisher = Agence France-Presse | date = 2009-04-23 | url = http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/04/23/bossnapping_wave_sweeps_france | accessdate = 2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These incidents took place in the context of wider French labor unrest related to the [[Late-2000s recession|recession of the late 2000s]], in which many companies in France and across the globe laid off workers during restructuring the companies did in response to falling profits or rising losses. Other labor incidents in France during this period included one in which laid-off workers threw eggs at their manager and burned effigies of him and another in which workers at a car parts factory threatened to blow it up after the factory was closed completely.&lt;ref name="afp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author1=Bon, Gerard  |author2=Michelson, Marcel  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = French workers threaten to blow up factory | publisher = Reuters | date = 2009-07-12 | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssConsumerGoodsAndRetailNews/idUSLC42677020090712 | accessdate = 2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, 2009, in response to the ongoing series of bossnapping incidents, French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] pledged to end the practice, saying, "We are a nation of laws. I won't allow this sort of thing." However, [[public opinion poll]]s in France at the time showed significant support for those using the strategy, a majority who disapproved of the tactic but sympathized with those practicing it, and only a small minority who completely opposed it. Thus, observers suggested that any strong action on the part of Sarkozy government to end bossnappings, included more proactive action by police to rescue hostages and arrest bossnappers, might lead to further unrest in other forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Matlack | first = Carol | title = Sarkozy's "Bossnapping" Dilemma | newspaper = Business Week | date = 2009-04-08 | url = http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/blog/europeinsight/archives/2009/04/sarkozys_bossna.html | accessdate = 2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Calculus of voting''' refers to any [[mathematical model]] which predicts voting behaviour by an electorate, including such features as participation rate.  A calculus of voting represents an hypothesized decision-making process.

These models are used in [[political science]] in an attempt to capture the relative importance of various factors influencing an elector to vote (or not vote) in a particular way.

==Example==

One such model was proposed by [[Anthony Downs]] (1957) and is adapted by [[William H. Riker]] and [[Peter Ordeshook]], in “A Theory of the Calculus of Voting” (Riker and Ordeshook 1968)

:''V'' = ''pB'' &amp;minus; ''C'' + ''D''

where
:''V'' = the proxy for the probability that the voter will turn out 
:''p'' = probability of vote “mattering”
:''B'' = “utility” benefit of voting--differential benefit of one candidate winning over the other 
:''C'' = costs of voting (time/effort spent)
:''D'' = citizen duty, goodwill feeling, psychological and civic benefit of voting (this term is not included in Downs's original model)

A [[political science]] model based on [[rational choice]] used to explain why citizens do or do not vote.


The alternative equation is

:''V'' = ''pB'' +  ''D'' &gt; ''C''

Where for voting to occur the (P)robability the vote will matter "times" the (B)enefit of one candidate winning over another combined with the feeling of civic (D)uty, must be greater than the (C)ost of voting

'''Cherenkov radiation''' (pronunciation: /tʃɛrɛnˈkɔv/) is an [[electromagnetic radiation]] emitted when a [[charged particle]] (such as an [[electron]]) passes through a [[dielectric]] medium at a [[speed]] greater than the [[phase velocity]] of [[speed of light|light]] in that medium. It is also known as the '''Vavilov–Cherenkov radiation''' ('''VCR''') (named after [[Sergey Vavilov]] and [[Pavel Cherenkov]]). It is named after the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scientist Pavel Cherenkov, the 1958 [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize]] winner who was the first to detect it experimentally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cherenkov |first=P.

Cherenkov radiation had been theoretically predicted by the [[England|English]] [[polymath]] [[Oliver Heaviside]] in papers published in 1888–89.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Oliver_Heaviside.html?id=e9wEntQmA0IC |year=1988 |pages=125–126 |title=Oliver Heaviside: The Life, Work, and Times of an Electrical Genius of the Victorian Age |isbn=9780801869099 |last1=Nahin |first1=P. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristic blue glow of an underwater [[nuclear reactor]] is due to Cherenkov radiation.

==Physical origin==
While [[Classical electromagnetism|electrodynamics]] holds that the [[speed of light]] ''in a [[vacuum]]'' is a [[physical constants|universal constant]] (''c''), the speed at which light propagates in a material may be significantly less than ''c''. For example, the speed of the propagation of light in [[water]] is only 0.75''c''. [[Matter]] can be accelerated beyond this speed (although still to less than ''c'') during nuclear reactions and in [[particle accelerator]]s. Cherenkov radiation results when a charged particle, most commonly an [[electron]], travels through a [[dielectric]] (electrically polarizable) medium with a speed greater than that at which light propagates in the same medium.

Moreover, the velocity that must be exceeded is the [[phase velocity]] of light rather than the [[group velocity]] of light. The phase velocity can be altered dramatically by employing a periodic medium, and in that case one can even achieve Cherenkov radiation with ''no'' minimum particle velocity, a phenomenon known as the [[Smith–Purcell effect]]. In a more complex periodic medium, such as a [[photonic crystal]], one can also obtain a variety of other anomalous Cherenkov effects, such as radiation in a backwards direction (whereas ordinary Cherenkov radiation forms an acute angle with the particle velocity).&lt;ref name=Luo03&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www-math.mit.edu/~stevenj/papers/LuoIb03.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.1079549 |title=Cerenkov Radiation in Photonic Crystals |year=2003 |last1=Luo |first1=C. |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=299 |issue=5605 |pages=368–71 |pmid=12532010 |last2=Ibanescu |first2=M. |last3=Johnson |first3=S. G. |last4=Joannopoulos |first4=J. D. |bibcode=2003Sci...299..368L |citeseerx=10.1.1.540.8969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:cherenkov.svg|thumb|The geometry of the Cherenkov radiation (shown for the ideal case of no dispersion).]]

In their original work on the theoretical foundations of Cherenkov radiation, Tamm and Frank wrote,"This peculiar radiation can evidently not be explained by any common mechanism such as the interaction of the fast electron with individual atom or as radiative scattering of electrons on atomic nuclei.  On the other hand, the phenomenon can be explained both qualitatively and quantitatively if one takes in account the fact that an electron moving in a medium does radiate light even if it is moving uniformly provided that its velocity is greater
than the velocity of light in the medium.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=I.E.|last1=Tamm|first2=I.M.|last2=Frank|title= Coherent radiation of fast electrons in a medium|journal= Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR |volume=14|pages=107|year=1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some misconceptions regarding Cherenkov radiation exist: for example, it is believed that the medium becomes electrically polarized by the particle's electric field. If the particle travels slowly then the disturbance elastically relaxes back to [[mechanical equilibrium]] as the particle passes. When the particle is traveling fast enough, however, the limited response speed of the medium means that a disturbance is left in the wake of the particle, and the energy contained in this disturbance radiates as a [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] shockwave. Such conceptions do not have any analytical foundation, as electromagnetic radiation is emitted when charged particles move in a dielectric medium at subluminal velocities which are not considered as Cherenkov radiation.

A common analogy is the [[sonic boom]] of a [[supersonic]] [[aircraft]] or [[bullet]]. The [[sound]] waves generated by the [[supersonic]] body propagate at the speed of sound itself; as such, the waves travel slower than the speeding object and cannot propagate forward from the body, instead forming a [[shock wave|shock front]]. In a similar way, a charged particle can generate a light [[shock wave]] as it travels through an insulator.

In the figure, the particle (red arrow) travels in a medium with speed &lt;math&gt;v_\text{p}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;c/n &lt; v_\text{p} &lt; c&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is [[speed of light in vacuum]], and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[refractive index]] of the medium. (If the medium is water, the condition is &lt;math&gt;0.75c &lt; v_\text{p} &lt; c&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;n=1.33&lt;/math&gt; for water at 20&amp;nbsp;°C.)

We define the ratio between the speed of the particle and the speed of light as &lt;math&gt;\beta=v_\text{p}/c&lt;/math&gt;. The emitted [[Electromagnetic radiation|light waves]] (blue arrows) travel at speed &lt;math&gt;v_\text{em}=c/n&lt;/math&gt;.

The left corner of the triangle represents the location of the superluminal particle at some initial moment (''t''=0). The right corner of the triangle is the location of the particle at some later time t. In the given time ''t'', the particle travels the distance

:&lt;math&gt;x_\text{p}=v_\text{p}t=\beta\,ct&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the emitted electromagnetic waves are constricted to travel the distance

:&lt;math&gt;x_\text{em}=v_\text{em}t=\frac{c}{n}t.&lt;/math&gt;

So:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\theta=\frac1{n\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that since this ratio is independent of time, one can take arbitrary times and achieve [[similarity (geometry)|similar triangles]]. The angle stays the same, meaning that subsequent waves generated between the initial time ''t''=0 and final time ''t'' will form similar triangles with coinciding right endpoints to the one shown.

===Reverse Cherenkov effect===
A reverse Cherenkov effect can be experienced using materials called negative-index [[metamaterial]]s (materials with a subwavelength microstructure that gives them an effective "average" property very different from their constituent materials, in this case having negative [[permittivity]] and negative [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]]). This means, when a charged particle (usually electrons) passes through a medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium, that particle will emit trailing radiation from its progress through the medium rather than in front of it (as is the case in normal materials with, both permittivity and permeability positive).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schewe |first=P. F. |last2=Stein |first2=B. |title=Topsy turvy: The first true "left handed" material |publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]] |date=24 March 2004 |accessdate=1 December 2008 |url=http://www.aip.org/pnu/2000/split/pnu476-1.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131202757/http://www.aip.org/pnu/2000/split/pnu476-1.htm# |archive-date=2009-01-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One can also obtain such reverse-cone Cherenkov radiation in non-metamaterial periodic media (where the periodic structure is on the same scale as the wavelength, so it cannot be treated as an effectively homogeneous metamaterial).&lt;ref name=Luo03/&gt;

===Arbitrary Cherenkov emission angle===
Cherenkov radiation can also radiate in an arbitrary direction using properly engineered one dimensional [[metamaterial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Genevet|first=P. |last2=Wintz |first2=D. |last3=Ambrosio |first3=A.|last4=She |first4=A. |last5=Blanchard |first5=R. |last6=Capasso |first6=F. |title=Controlled steering of Cherenkov surface plasmon wakes with a one-dimensional metamaterial |journal=[[Nature Nanotechnology]] |volume=10 |issue=|pages=804–809 |year=2015 |doi=10.1038/nnano.2015.137|bibcode = 2015NatNa..10..804G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is designed to introduce a gradient of phase retardation along the trajectory of the fast travelling particle (&lt;math&gt; d\phi/dx&lt;/math&gt; ), reversing or steering Cherenkov emission at arbitrary angles given by the generalized relation:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\theta=\frac1{n\beta} +\frac {n}{k_0} \cdot \frac {d\phi} {dx}&lt;/math&gt;

==Characteristics==
The [[frequency spectrum]] of Cherenkov radiation by a particle is given by the [[Frank–Tamm formula]]:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2E}{dx \, d\omega} = \frac{q^2}{4 \pi} \mu(\omega) \omega {\left(1 - \frac{c^2} {v^2 n^2(\omega)}\right)} &lt;/math&gt;

The Frank-Tamm formula describes the amount of energy emitted from Cherenkov radiation, per wavelength, per unit length traveled. &lt;math&gt;\mu(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] and &lt;math&gt;n(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Refractive index|index of refraction]] of the material the charge particle moves through.

Unlike [[fluorescence]] or [[stimulated emission|emission]] [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]] that have characteristic spectral peaks, Cherenkov radiation is continuous. Around the visible spectrum, the relative intensity per unit frequency is approximately proportional to the frequency. That is, higher frequencies (shorter [[wavelength]]s) are more intense in Cherenkov radiation. This is why visible Cherenkov radiation is observed to be brilliant blue. In fact, most Cherenkov radiation is in the [[ultraviolet]] spectrum—it is only with sufficiently accelerated charges that it even becomes visible; the sensitivity of the human eye peaks at green, and is very low in the violet portion of the spectrum.

There is a cut-off frequency above which the equation &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta=1/(n\beta)&lt;/math&gt; can no longer be satisfied. The [[refractive index]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; varies with frequency (and hence with wavelength) in such a way that the intensity cannot continue to increase at ever shorter wavelengths, even for very relativistic particles (where v/[[speed of light|c]] is close to 1). At [[X-ray]] frequencies, the refractive index becomes less than unity (note that in media the phase velocity may exceed ''c'' without violating relativity) and hence no X-ray emission (or shorter wavelength emissions such as [[gamma ray]]s) would be observed. However, X-rays can be generated at special frequencies just below the frequencies corresponding to core electronic transitions in a material, as the index of refraction is often greater than 1 just below a resonant frequency (see [[Kramers-Kronig relation]] and [[anomalous dispersion]]).

As in sonic booms and bow shocks, the angle of the shock [[cone (geometry)|cone]] is directly related to the velocity of the disruption. The Cherenkov angle is zero at the threshold velocity for the emission of Cherenkov radiation. The angle takes on a maximum as the particle speed approaches the speed of light. Hence, observed angles of incidence can be used to compute the direction and speed of a Cherenkov radiation-producing charge.

Cherenkov radiation can be generated in the eye by charged particles hitting the [[vitreous humour]], giving the impression of flashes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Vavilov – Cherenkov radiation: Its discovery and application |year=2009 |last1=Bolotovskii |first1=B.

==Uses==

===Detection of labelled biomolecules===
Cherenkov radiation is widely used to facilitate the detection of small amounts and low concentrations of [[biomolecule]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=H. |last2=Zhang |first2=X. |last3=Xing |first3=B. |last4=Han |first4=P. |last5=Gambhir |first5=S.

===Medical imaging of radioisotopes and external beam radiotherapy===
[[File:Cherenkov-breast.png|thumb|Cherenkov light emission imaged from the chest wall of a patient undergoing whole breast irradiation, using 6 MeV beam from a linear accelerator in radiotherapy.]]
More recently, Cherenkov light has been used to image substances in the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1117/1.3514659 |pmid=21198146 |pmc=3003718 |bibcode=2010JBO....15f0505L |title=Optical imaging of reporter gene expression using a positron-emission-tomography probe |journal=Journal of Biomedical Optics |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=060505–060505–3 |last1=Liu |first1=Hongguang |last2=Ren |first2=Gang |last3=Liu |first3=Shuanglong |last4=Zhang |first4=Xiaofen |last5=Chen |first5=Luxi |last6=Han |first6=Peizhen |last7=Cheng |first7=Zhen |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1155/2011/641618 |pmid=21747821 |pmc=3124671 |title=Cerenkov Luminescence Tomography for ''In'' Vivo ''Radiopharmaceutical'' Imaging |journal=International Journal of Biomedical Imaging |volume=2011 |pages=1–6 |year=2011 |last1=Zhong |first1=Jianghong |last2=Qin |first2=Chenghu |last3=Yang |first3=Xin |last4=Zhu |first4=Shuping |last5=Zhang |first5=Xing |last6=Tian |first6=Jie }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2020899 |year=1991 |last1=Sinoff |first1=C.

===Nuclear reactors===
[[File:TrigaReactorCore.jpeg|thumb|landscape|right|Cherenkov radiation in a [[TRIGA]] [[pool-type reactor|reactor pool]].]]
Cherenkov radiation is used to detect high-energy charged particles. In [[pool-type reactor|pool-type nuclear reactors]], [[beta particles]] (high-energy electrons) are released as the [[fission products]] decay. The glow continues after the chain reaction stops, dimming as the shorter-lived products decay. Similarly, Cherenkov radiation can characterize the remaining [[radioactivity]] of spent fuel rods. This phenomenon is used to verify the presence of spent nuclear fuel in spent fuel pools for nuclear safeguards purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1748-0221/12/06/T06001 |bibcode=2017JInst..12.6001B |title=On Cherenkov light production by irradiated nuclear fuel rods |journal=Journal of Instrumentation |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=T06001 |last1=Branger |first1=E |last2=Grape |first2=S |last3=Jacobsson Svärd |first3=S |last4=Jansson |first4=P |last5=Andersson Sundén |first5=E |year=2017 |url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-309736 |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astrophysics experiments===
When a high-energy ([[TeV]]) [[gamma photon]] or [[cosmic ray]] interacts with the [[Earth's atmosphere]], it may produce an electron-[[positron]] [[pair production|pair]] with enormous velocities. The Cherenkov radiation emitted in the atmosphere by these charged particles is used to determine the direction and energy of the cosmic ray or gamma ray, which is used for example in the [[IACT|Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Technique]] ([[IACT]]), by experiments such as [[VERITAS]], [[H.E.S.S.]], [[MAGIC (telescope)|MAGIC]]. Cherenkov radiation emitted in tanks filled with water by those charged particles reaching earth is used for the same goal by the Extensive Air Shower experiment [[High Altitude Water Cherenkov Experiment|HAWC]], the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] and other projects. Similar methods are used in very large [[neutrino]] detectors, such as the [[Super-Kamiokande]], the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory|Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO)]] and [[IceCube]]. Other projects operated in the past applying related techniques, such as [[STACEE]], a former solar tower refurbished to work as a non-imaging Cherenkov observatory, which was located in [[New Mexico]].

Astrophysics observatories using the Cherenkov technique to measure air showers are key to determine the properties of astronomical objects that emit Very High Energy gamma rays, such as [[supernova remnant]]s and [[blazar]]s.

===Particle physics experiments===
{{See also|Cherenkov detector|Ring imaging Cherenkov detector}}

Cherenkov radiation is commonly used in experimental [[particle physics]] for particle identification. One could measure (or put limits on) the [[velocity]] of an electrically charged elementary particle by the properties of the Cherenkov light it emits in a certain medium. If the [[momentum]] of the particle is measured independently, one could compute the [[mass]] of the particle by its momentum and velocity (see [[four-momentum]]), and hence identify the particle.

The simplest type of particle identification device based on a Cherenkov radiation technique is the threshold counter, which gives an answer as to whether the velocity of a charged particle is lower or higher than a certain value (&lt;math&gt;v_0=c/n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]], and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[refractive index]] of the medium) by looking at whether this particle does or does not emit Cherenkov light in a certain medium. Knowing particle momentum, one can separate particles lighter than a certain threshold from those heavier than the threshold.

The most advanced type of a detector is the RICH, or [[Ring-imaging Cherenkov detector]], developed in the 1980s. In a RICH detector, a cone of Cherenkov light is produced when a high speed charged particle traverses a suitable medium, often called radiator. This light cone is detected on a position sensitive planar photon detector, which allows reconstructing a ring or disc, the radius of which is a measure for the Cherenkov emission angle. Both focusing and proximity-focusing detectors are in use. In a focusing RICH detector, the photons are collected by a spherical mirror and focused onto the photon detector placed at the focal plane. The result is a circle with a radius independent of the emission point along the particle track. This scheme is suitable for low refractive index radiators—i.e. gases—due to the larger radiator length needed to create enough photons. In the more compact proximity-focusing design, a thin radiator volume emits a cone of Cherenkov light which traverses a small distance—the proximity gap—and is detected on the photon detector plane. The image is a ring of light, the radius of which is defined by the Cherenkov emission angle and the proximity gap. The ring thickness is determined by the thickness of the radiator. An example of a proximity gap RICH detector is the High Momentum Particle Identification Detector (HMPID),&lt;ref&gt;[http://alice-hmpid.web.cern.ch The High Momentum Particle Identification Detector at CERN]&lt;/ref&gt; a detector currently under construction for ALICE ([[A Large Ion Collider Experiment]]), one of the six experiments at the LHC ([[Large Hadron Collider]]) at [[CERN]].

==Vacuum Cherenkov radiation==
The Cherenkov effect can occur in vacuum.{{Citation needed|reason=Vacuum Cherenkov radiation would contradict special relativity|date=November 2018}} In a slow-wave structure,{{explain |date=July 2016}} the [[phase velocity]] decreases and the velocity of charged particles can exceed the phase velocity while remaining lower than &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. In such a system, this effect can be derived from conservation of the energy and momentum where the momentum of a [[photon]] should be &lt;math&gt;p=\hbar\beta&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt; \beta&lt;/math&gt; is [[phase constant]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11082-015-0261-8 |title=Generalized momentum equation of quantum mechanics |journal=Optical and Quantum Electronics |volume=48 |issue=2 |year=2016 |last1=Wang |first1=Zhong-Yue }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the [[de Broglie relation]] &lt;math&gt;p=\hbar k&lt;/math&gt;. This type of radiation (VCR) is used to generate high power microwaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1983 |title=Relativistic multiwave Cerenkov generator |journal=[[Soviet Technical Physics Letters]] |volume=9 |pages=1385–1389 |bibcode=1983PZhTF...9.1385B |last1=Bugaev |first1=S.

The schools of [[Mahayana Buddhism]] developed several different schemes of doctrinal classification (Chinese: jiaoxiang panshi or panjiao [tenet classification]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr|editor2-last=Lopez|editor2-first=Donald S.

==History==
The classification of Buddha teachings is discussed very early by Mahayana Buddhists in China. In 600 AD there were 10 main classifications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qts.com.cn/bezz/berr06/201101/651.html 【报恩论坛】智者大师评判“南三北七”的意义（连载一）]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huayen.org.tw/thesis/13/1315.pdf 五、六世紀中國各家的判教理論]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
And it continued to develop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BJ001/bj100610.htm Preface to The Essence of Teaching and Meditation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guoxue.com/www/xsxx/txt.asp?id=1061 1900年来佛教判教研究要述]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kukai]] in [[Japan]] wrote Himitsumandara jūjūshinron (祕密曼荼羅十住心論, Treatise on The Ten Stages of the Development of Mind) and [[Enchin]] also wrote his classification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china2551.org/Article/tmwh/tmyj/200802/3902.html 空海“十住心”的判教论] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906064458/http://www.china2551.org/Article/tmwh/tmyj/200802/3902.html |date=2013-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chibs.edu.tw/publication/chbj/10/chbj1011.htm En-nin and the Japanese Tendai School] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015081821/http://www.chibs.edu.tw/publication/chbj/10/chbj1011.htm |date=2006-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan Buddhists also developed different classifications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ifeng.com/article/1574227.html 佛教判教]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkbuddhist.org/magazine/479/479_03.html 華嚴宗佛性 思想初探 五教佛性與心性本體]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five Periods and Eight Teachings== 
[[Zhiyi]] wrote [[Mohe Zhiguan]] (摩訶止觀) and Fahua Xuanyi (法華玄義). He classifies the Buddha's teaching into 5 periods and 8 teachings (五時八教).
They are the Period of Avatamsaka (華嚴時), Agamas (阿含時), Vaipulya (方等時), Prajna (般若時) and Dharma-pundarik/Nirvana (法華涅槃時). The Eight Teachings are subdivided into two groups, one is the Fourfold Doctrines of Conversion (化法四教) and the other is the Fourfold Methods of Conversion (化儀四教). They are Tripitaka Teaching (三藏教), Shared Teaching (通教), Distinctive Teaching (別教), Complete Teaching (圓教), Sudden Teaching (頓教), Gradual Teaching (漸教), Secret Teaching (秘密教) and Variable Teaching (不定教).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131103025354/http://www.buddhistdoor.com/OldWeb/bdoor/archive/nutshell/teach70.htm Buddhism in a Nutshell - Chap 70]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Tiantai]] followed this classification.

==Five Divisions and Ten Schools==
[[Fazang]] wrote Huayan Yisheng Jiaoyi Fenqi Zhang (華嚴一乘教義分齊章).&lt;ref&gt;[http://feikongfeise.blog.163.com/blog/static/8197498520087710186372 《华严五教章》简介]&lt;/ref&gt; It classified  Buddhist teachings into 5 Divisions and 10 Schools (五教十宗). They are the teaching of sravakas (sound-hearers) (小乘教), the elementary teaching of mahayana (大乘初教), the final teaching of mahayana (大乘終教), the abrupt or sudden teaching of mahayana (大乘頓教) and the all-round or complete teaching of one vehicle (一乘圓教). The 5 divisions are further separated into 10 schools, namely the reality of self and dharma (mind and matter) (我法俱有宗), the reality of dharma, but not self (法有我無宗), dharmas have neither creation nor destruction (法無去來宗), present dharmas are both apparent and real (現通假實宗), common or phenomenal ideas are wrong, and fundamental reality is the only truth (俗妄真實宗), dharmas are merely names (諸法但有宗), all Dharmas are empty (一切皆空宗), the Bhutatathata is not unreal (真實不空宗), phenomena and their perceptions are to be eradicated (相想俱絕宗) and the perfect, all inclusive and complete teaching of one vehicle (圓明具德宗).
&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131103025328/http://www.buddhistdoor.com/OldWeb/bdoor/archive/nutshell/teach66.htm Buddhism in a Nutshell - Chap 66]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huayen.org.tw/b3.asp 論文集索引] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20040710045959/http://www.huayen.org.tw/b3.asp |date=2004-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Huayan school]] followed this classification.

A '''cockade''' is a knot of ribbons, or other circular- or oval-shaped symbol of distinctive colours which is usually worn on a [[hat]].

==Eighteenth century==
In the 18th and 19th centuries, coloured cockades were used in Europe to show the allegiance of their wearers to some political faction, their rank, or as part of a servant's livery.&lt;ref name="google31"&gt;{{cite book|title=Patriots Against Fashion: Clothing and Nationalism in Europe’s Age of Revolutions|author=Maxwell, A.|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=9781137277145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JLpCBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT94|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Parades and the Politics of the Street: Festive Culture in the Early American Republic|author=Newman, S.P.|date=2010|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press, Incorporated|isbn=9780812200478|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WvKSSSZzrBoC&amp;pg=PA161|page=161|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Military uniform]]s would use cockades as well.

A cockade was pinned on the side of a man's [[tricorne]] or [[cocked hat]], or on his lapel. Women could also wear it on their hat or in their hair.

In pre-revolutionary France, the cockade of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] dynasty was all white.&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The White Cockade; Or, Bourbon Songster: Being a Patriotic Collection of Songs on the Downfall of Tyranny, and Restoration of Louis XVIII., Etc. &amp;#91;A Chap-book.&amp;#93;|date=1814|publisher=J.

During the 1780 [[Gordon Riots]] in London the blue cockade became a symbol of anti-government feelings and was worn by most of the rioters.&lt;ref name="google10"&gt;{{cite book|title=Military Intervention in Britain: From the Gordon Riots to the Gibraltar Incident|author=Babington, A.|date=2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781317397717|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-SoCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21|page=21|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google11"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Covent Garden Journal ...|author=Stockdale, J.J.|date=1810|publisher=J.J.

During the [[American Revolution]], the [[Continental Army]] initially wore cockades of various colors as an ''ad hoc'' form of rank insignia, as General [[George Washington]] wrote:

{{quote |As the Continental Army has unfortunately no uniforms, and consequently many inconveniences must arise from not being able to distinguish the commissioned officers from the privates, it is desired that some badge of distinction be immediately provided; for instance that the field officers may have red or pink colored cockades in their hats, the captains yellow or buff, and the [[subalterns]] green.&lt;ref name="defense"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=42199|publisher=archive.defense.gov|title=Defense.gov News Article: Insignia: The Way You Tell Who's Who in the Military|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google18"&gt;{{cite book|title=American archives|author=Force, P.|date=1844|publisher=Рипол Классик|isbn=9785885286961|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A5oTAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA1745|pages=2–1745|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Before long however, the Continental Army reverted to wearing the black cockade they inherited from the British. Later, when [[Franco-American relations#France and the American Revolution|France became an ally of the United States]], the Continental Army pinned the white cockade of the French ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' onto their old black cockade; the French reciprocally pinned the black cockade onto their white cockade, as a mark of the French-American alliance. The black-and-white cockade thus became known as the "Union Cockade".&lt;ref name="google19"&gt;{{cite book|title=LincolnÂ?s 90-Day Volunteers 1861: From Fort Sumter to First Bull Run|author1=Field, R.|author2=Hook, A.|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781782009214|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KKWqCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47|page=47|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google20"&gt;{{cite book|title=Early American Drama|author=Richards, J.H.|date=1997|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=9781101177211|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rLpLlr1gBBoC&amp;pg=PA68|page=68|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google21"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lincoln's Citadel: The Civil War in Washington, DC|author=Winkle, K.J.|date=2013|publisher=W.

In the [[Storming of the Bastille]], [[Camille Desmoulins]] initially encouraged the revolutionary crowd to wear green; this colour was later rejected as it was associated with the reactionary [[Charles X of France|Count of Artois]]. Instead revolutionaries would wear cockades with the traditional colours of the [[Coat of arms of Paris|arms of Paris]], red and blue. Later the Bourbon white was added to this cockade - thus producing the original [[tricolore cockade|''Tricolore'' cockade]].&lt;ref name="google22"/&gt; Later, distinctive colours and styles of cockade would indicate the wearer's faction—although the meanings of the various styles were not entirely consistent, and varied somewhat by region and period.

==Cockades of the Confederate States==
Echoing their use when Americans rebelled against Britain, cockades – usually made with blue ribbons and worn on clothing or hats – were widespread tokens of [[Slave and free states|southern]] support for [[Secession in the United States|secession]] preceding the [[American Civil War]] of 1861–1865.&lt;ref&gt;http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/female-partisans/ New York Times blogs&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cockades of the European military==
[[File:Kokarde Schwarz-Weiß-Rot 1897.jpg|thumb|200px|A metal cockade on the swivel of a [[Pickelhaube]] helmet.]]
From the 15th century various [[Europe]]an monarchy realms used cockades to denote the nationalities of their military.&lt;ref name="google24"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Little Bombardier, and Pocket Gunner.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]], the armies of [[France]] and [[Russia]], had the imperial French cockade or the larger cockade of [[St. George]] pinned on the front of their [[shako]]s.&lt;ref name="google29"&gt;{{cite book|title=Napoleon's Mercenaries: Foreign Units in the French Army Under the Consulate and Empire, 1799-1814|author=Dempsey, G.|date=2002|publisher=Greenhill Books|isbn=9781853674884|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cUuaBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA267|page=267|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Second [[German Empire]] (1870–1918) used two cockades on each army headgear: one (black-white-red) for the empire; the other for one of the monarchies the empire was composed of, which had used their own colors long before. The only exceptions were the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Württemberg, having preserved the right to keep their own armed forces which were not integrated in the Imperial Army. Their only cockades were either white and blue (Bavaria) or black-red-black (Württemberg).&lt;ref name="google30"&gt;{{cite book|title=MILITARY UNIFORMS IN EUROPE 1900 - 2000 Volume One|author=Kidd, R.S.|date=2013|publisher=LULU Press|isbn=9781291187441|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FE4DBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|page=5|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google32"&gt;{{cite book|title=Germany at War: 400 Years of Military History &amp;#91;4 volumes&amp;#93;: 400 Years of Military History|author=D, D.T.Z.P.|date=2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598849813|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCWMBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA494|page=494|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France began the first [[History of the Armée de l'Air (1909-1942)|Air Service]] in 1909 and soon picked the traditional French cockade as the first national emblem, now usually termed a [[roundel]], on military aircraft. During World War I, other countries adopted national cockades and used these coloured emblems as roundels on their military aircraft. These designs often bear an additional central device or emblem to further identify national aircraft, those from the [[French navy]] bearing a black anchor within the French cockade.&lt;ref name="google35"&gt;{{cite book|title=The U.S. Air Service in the Great War, 1917-1919|author=Cooke, J.J.|date=1996|publisher=Praeger|isbn=9780275948627|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pvHjd79SgzIC&amp;pg=PA202|page=202|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hungarians|Hungarian]] revolutionaries wore cockades during the [[Hungarian revolution of 1848]] and during the [[1956 revolution]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3249">'''Cognitive synonymy''' is a type of [[synonym]]y in which synonyms are so similar in [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] that they cannot be differentiated either [[denotation|denotatively]] or [[connotation|connotatively]], that is, not even by [[association of ideas|mental associations]], [[connotation]]s, emotive responses, and [[poetry|poetic value]]. It is a stricter (more precise) technical definition of synonymy, specifically for theoretical (e.g., [[linguistics|linguistic]] and [[philosophical]]) purposes. In [[usage]] employing this definition, synonyms with greater differences are often called near-synonyms rather than synonyms.&lt;ref name="Stanojević_2009"&gt;{{Citation |last=Stanojević |first=Maja |year=2009 |title= Cognitive synonymy: a general overview |journal=Facta Universitatis, Linguistics and Literature series |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=193-200 |url=http://facta.junis.ni.ac.rs/lal/lal200902/lal200902-05.pdf |doi= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
If a word is cognitively synonymous with another word, they refer to the same thing independently of [[context (language use)|context]]. Thus, a word is cognitively synonymous with another word [[if and only if]] all instances of both words express the same exact thing, and the referents are [[modal logic|necessarily]] [[identity (philosophy)|identical]], which means that the words' interchangeability is not [[wikt:context-sensitive|context-sensitive]].

[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] used the concept of cognitive synonymy extensively in his famous 1951 paper "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]", where two words were cognitively synonymous if they were interchangeable in every possible instance.&lt;ref name="Hanna_2005"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hanna |first=Patricia |year=2005 |title=''Cognitive Synonymy'', from Notes on "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" |url=http://www.hum.utah.edu/~phanna/classes/ling5030/webpostings/notestwodogmas/node14.html |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{Citation |last=Quine |first=Willard Van Orman |year=1951 |title=Two dogmas of empiricism |journal=The Philosophical Review |volume=60 |issue= |pages=20–43 |url=http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html |doi= |postscript=. Reprinted in his 1953 book ''From a Logical Point of View''. Harvard University Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example,
* All bachelors are unmarried men.
* All unmarried men are not married.

Quine notes that if one is [[use-mention distinction|referring to the word itself]], this doesn't apply, as in,
* ''Bachelor'' has fewer than ten letters.

As compared to the substitution which is obviously false,
* "Unmarried men" has less than ten letters.

'''Confusion''' (from [[Latin]] ''confusĭo, -ōnis'', from ''confundere'': "to pour together;" "to mingle together;" "to confuse") is the state of being bewildered or unclear in one’s mind about something.

==Medical term==
{{Infobox symptom 
|Name=Mental Confusion Classifications 
|Field=[[Psychiatry]]
|ICD10={{ICD10|R|41|0|r|40}} 
|ICD9={{ICD9|298.9}}

}}
The term "acute mental confusion"&lt;ref name="oxforddictionaries.com"&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/confusion ''Confusion Definition'']; [[Oxford Dictionary]] online.&lt;/ref&gt; is often used interchangeably with [[delirium]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symptomfind.com/symptoms/confusion/ ''Delirium'']; Symptom Finder online ; accessed .&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''[[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]]'' and the ''[[Medical Subject Headings]]'' publications to describe the [[pathology]]. These refer to the loss of [[Orientation (mental)|orientation]], or the ability to place oneself correctly in the world by time, location and personal identity. Mental confusion is sometimes accompanied by disordered [[consciousness]] (the loss of linear thinking) and [[memory]] loss (the ability to correctly recall previous events or learn new material).&lt;ref name=thefreedictionary&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/mental+confusion thefreedictionary.com] Citing: Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers; 2007; Saunders.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Confusion may result from drug side effects or from a relatively sudden brain dysfunction.  Acute confusion is often called [[delirium]] (or "acute confusional state"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patient.info/doctor/Acute-Confusional-State.htm ''Acute Confusional State'']; Dr. Gurvinder Rull; patient.info; Document ID/Version/Reference: 1714/22/bgp2104; updated: 13 Jan 2009; accessed: ''when?''.&lt;/ref&gt; although delirium often includes a much broader array of disorders than simple confusion.  These disorders include the inability to focus attention; various impairments in awareness; and temporal or spatial dis-orientation.  Mental confusion can result from chronic organic brain pathologies, such as [[dementia]], as well.

===Differential diagnosis===
{{further|Differential diagnosis}}

The most common causes of drug induced acute confusion are [[dopaminergic]] drugs (used for the treatment of [[Parkinson's disease]]), [[diuretics]], [[tricyclic antidepressants|tricyclic]] or [[tetracyclic antidepressants]] and [[benzodiazepines]].  The elderly, and especially those with pre-existing dementia, are most at risk for drug induced acute confusional states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hufschmidt |first1=A. |last2=Shabarin |first2=V. |last3=Zimmer |first3=T. |title=Drug-induced confusional states: the usual suspects? |journal=[[Acta Neurologica Scandinavica]] |volume=120 |issue=6 |pages=436–8 |date=Dec 2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0404.2009.01174.x |pmid=19804475}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New research is finding a link between [[Vitamin D]] deficiency and [[cognitive impairment]] (which includes 'foggy brain').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thirdage.com/brain-fitness/vitamin-d-linked-to-cognitive-impairment''Vitamin D Linked to Cognitive Impairment'']; [[Third Age]] online; accessed: .&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=WP:MEDRS|date=June 2018}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}

The "'''Cool S'''", also known as '''Superman S''', '''Stüssy S''', '''Super S''', '''Pointy S'''&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite web |title=That 'S' Thing Everyone Drew in School, WHAT IS IT? |url=https://www.vice.com/en_se/article/that-s-thing-everyone-drew-in-school-what-is-it |website=Vice |date=23 July 2016 |accessdate=29 January 2017 |first=Julian |last=Morgans |quote=people have been drawing this S long before Stussy was established}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Graffiti S'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.drawingnow.com/drawings/100332/how-to-make-one-graffiti-s/|title=how to make one graffiti S|website=DrawingNow DrawingNow|language=en|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as many other names, is a [[graffiti]] signature of [[popular culture]] that is typically [[doodle]]d on children's notebooks or graffitied on walls.

==Shape==
[[File:"Cool S" Drawing Instructions.svg|thumb|right|A guide to drawing the "Cool S"]]

The Cool S consists of 14 line segments, forming a stylized, pointed [[S (letter)|S]]-shape. The tails of the S appear to link underneath so that it loops around on itself in the same way as the [[infinity symbol]] does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Local Investigates: The Mysterious S Symbol |url=https://nyulocal.com/local-investigates-the-mysterious-s-symbol-9254626b8225#.9jqdl0p67 |website=NYU Local |date=12 February 2014 |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cool S has no [[reflection symmetry]], but has 2-fold [[rotational symmetry]] and [[tessellation|tessellates]] with squares. As illustrated, a common way to draw the shape begins with two sets of three parallel, vertical lines, one above the other.

==Origin==
The origin of the Cool S is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Neelson |first1=Caleb |title=Solve the Mystery of the Pointy S |url=http://www.printmag.com/imprint/solve-the-mystery-of-the-pointy-s/ |website=Print Magazine |accessdate=29 January 2017 |date=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name 'Superman S' comes from a belief that it was a symbol for [[Superman]], whose costume features a stylised S in a diamond shape, but that shape is quite different. Similarly, the name 'Stussy S' is from a theory that it might be a symbol of the American surfwear company [[Stüssy]].&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6254">A '''curb stomp''', also called curbing, curb checking, curb painting, or making someone '''bite the curb''' is a form of [[assault]] in which a victim's mouth is forcefully placed on a [[curb]] and then [[Stomp (strike)|stomped]] from behind, causing severe [[injury|injuries]] and sometimes [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/more-arrests-in-curb-stomping-death-1.246543|title=More arrests in curb stomping death|publisher=CBC News|date=2000-06-03|accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work=Gangland |title=VolksFront|date=November 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable incidents ==
* In July 2002, 16-year old German Marinus Schöberl was tortured by young, underage neo-Nazis in an abandoned pigsty in [[Oberuckersee]] (in the German state of [[Brandenburg]]) and killed after curb-stomping. The main perpetrator, who was 17 at the time of the killing, was released after serving eight years in prison.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.presseportal.de/pm/2790/1736137&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2003, [[Tacoma, Washington]] resident Randall Townsend was murdered by four people. David Nikos Pillatos, Scotty James Butters, and Tristain Lynn Frye beat and kicked Townsend while Kurtis William Monschke delivered the final blow: curb-stomping. Monschke had recently been named head of the Washington chapter of [[Volksfront]]. "Prosecutors said the attack was meant to lift Monschke's status in the [[white supremacist]] movement and to earn Frye a pair of red shoelaces, with the red signifying the drawing of blood." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/wa-court-of-appeals/1197904.html|title=''STATE v. MONSCHKE'', No. 31847-4-II (WN. 2006).|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2004/kurtis-monschke-and-other-racists-commit-violent-killing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tristain Lynn Frye was sentenced to 13 years, nine months for [[second-degree murder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lmtribune.com/northwest/woman-sentenced-in-transient-s-killing/article_d1a9e5cb-caa2-59d0-a0ed-480a7452cd4e.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scotty James Butters and David Nikos Pillatos pled to [[first-degree murder]], accepted a plea agreement and testified against Monschke in exchange for being able to request that their imprisonment be no more than approximately 30 years. in June 2004, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled "a sentence longer than the standard range could not be ordered by a judge without action by a jury, meaning Butters and Pillatos could face no more than 31 years in prison."

Kurtis William Monschke was convicted of aggravated first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.
The incident has been described as a [[hate crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/soundlife/v-printerfriendly/story/201056.html|title=Tacoma murder revisited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On August 26, 2011, Dane Hall was curb stomped in an attack outside a [[gay bar]] in Salt Lake City, Utah. He lost six teeth and suffered a broken jaw as a result of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705390124/Gay-man-severely-beaten-outside-club-says-he-was-victim-of-hate-crime.html?pg=all|title=Gay man severely beaten outside club says he was victim of hate crime|publisher=Deseret News|author=Pat Reavy|date=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Junko Furuta]], a Japanese high school girl, was curb stomped among the various other tortures inflicted on her before her death.

'''''Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism''''', by [[Chögyam Trungpa]] is a book addressing many common pitfalls of self-deception in seeking spirituality, which the author coins as ''[[Spiritual materialism]]''. It is the transcript of two series of lectures given by Trungpa [[Rinpoche]] in 1970–71.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shambhala.org/meditation/books2.php Book Corner - Shambhala&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210031919/http://shambhala.org/meditation/books2.php |date=2011-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Psychology Today]]'' Michael J. Formica writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;As soon as we cast something into a role, as soon as we put a label on it, as soon as we name it and give it life by virtue of our investment (read: ego), we take away all its power and it is nothing more than an event – it is no longer a spiritual revelation, but simply a material experience. That is spiritual materialism at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/enlightened-living/200812/cutting-through-spiritual-materialism Cutting through Spiritual Materialism | Psychology Today&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Day-care sex-abuse hysteria''' was a [[moral panic]] that occurred primarily in the 1980s and early 1990s featuring charges against [[day care|day-care]] providers of several forms of [[child abuse]], including [[Satanic ritual abuse]].&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=L |last=Miller |authorlink= |title=Parole Board recommends Amirault's commutation |url=http://www.truthinjustice.org/amirault.htm |quote=The Amiraults always insisted they were innocent, the victims of a sex-abuse hysteria that swept the country in the 1980s and questionable testimony from child witnesses. |agency=Associated Press |date=2001-07-06 |accessdate=2007-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104063907/http://truthinjustice.org/amirault.htm |archivedate=2007-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent case in [[Kern County, California]] first brought the issue of day-care sexual abuse to the forefront of the public awareness, and the issue figured prominently in news coverage for almost a decade. The Kern County case was followed by cases elsewhere in the United States as well as Canada, New Zealand, Brazil, and various European countries.

==Causes==

===Anxiety===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, more and more mothers were working outside of the home, resulting in the opening of large numbers of day-care centers. Anxiety and guilt over leaving young children with strangers may have created a climate of fear and readiness to believe false accusations.&lt;ref name=Peggy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pendergrast |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Pendergrast |title=Victims of Memory: Sex Abuse Accusations and Shattered Lives |publisher= |quote='It seems [the day-care sex- abuse hysteria] had something to do with this fear that we'd turned our kids over to total strangers,' sociologist Catherine Beckett says ... |isbn=978-0-942679-18-2|year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suggestions and false allegations when interviewing children===
{{synthesis|section|talksection=Synthesis in discussion of causes|date=November 2016}}

Children are vulnerable to outside influences that lead to fabrication of testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carter |first=Sherrie Bourg |title=Children in the Courtroom |year=2005 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their testimony can be influenced in a variety of ways.
Maggie Bruck in her article published by the [[American Psychological Association]] wrote that children incorporate aspects of the interviewer's questions into their answers in an attempt to tell the interviewer what the child believes is being sought.&lt;ref name="ceci"&gt;{{harvnb|Ceci|Bruck|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies also show that when adults ask children questions that do not make sense (such as "is milk bigger than water?" or "is red heavier than yellow?"), most children will offer an answer, believing that there is an answer to be given, rather than understand the absurdity of the question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McGough |first=Lucy S. |title=Child Witnesses: Fragile Voices in the American Legal System |year=1994 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, repeated questioning of children causes them to change their answers. This is because the children perceive the repeated questioning as a sign that they did not give the "correct" answer previously.&lt;ref name = "Ceci79"&gt;{{harvnb|Ceci|Bruck|1996|pp=79–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children are also especially susceptible to leading and [[suggestive question]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown that only a small percentage of children produce fictitious reports of sexual abuse on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, D. P. H., and J. M. McGraw: Reliable and Fictitious Accounts of Sexual Abuse to Children. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 2, 27–45, 1987 {{doi|10.1177/088626087002001002}} [http://jiv.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/2/1/27]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oates, R. K., D.P. Jones, D. Denson, A.

Interviewer bias also plays a role in shaping child testimony. When an interviewer has a preconceived notion as to the truth of the matter being investigated, the questioning is conducted in a manner to extract statements that support these beliefs.&lt;ref name = "Ceci79"/&gt; As a result, evidence that could disprove the belief is never sought by the interviewer. Additionally, positive reinforcement by the interviewer can taint child testimony. Often such reinforcement is given to encourage a spirit of cooperation by the child, but the impartial tone can quickly disappear as the interviewer nods, smiles, or offers verbal encouragement to "helpful" statements.&lt;ref name = "Ceci79"/&gt; Some studies show that when interviewers make reassuring statements to child witnesses, the children are more likely to fabricate stories of past events that never occurred.&lt;ref name="ceci140"&gt;{{harvnb|Ceci|Bruck|1996|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer pressure also influences children to fabricate stories. Studies show that when a child witness is told that his or her friends have already testified that certain events occurred, the child witness was more likely to create a matching story.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ceci|Bruck|1996|pp=146–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status of the interviewer can also influence a child's testimony, because the more authority an interviewer has such as a police officer, the more likely a child is to comply with that person's agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ceci|Bruck|1996|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, while there are supporters of the use of [[anatomically correct doll]]s in questioning victims of sexual abuse/molestation, there are also critics of this practice.&lt;ref name ="Ceci162"&gt;{{harvnb|Ceci|Bruck|1996|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics say that because of the novelty of the dolls, children will act out sexually explicit acts with the dolls even if the child has not been sexually abused.&lt;ref name ="Ceci162"/&gt; Another criticism is that because the studies that compare the differences between how abused and non-abused children play with these dolls are conflicting (some studies suggest that sexually abused children play with anatomically correct dolls in a more sexually explicit manner than non-abused children, while other studies suggest that there is no correlation), it is impossible to interpret what is meant by how a child plays with these dolls.&lt;ref name ="Ceci162"/&gt;

==Significant cases==

===McMartin Preschool===
{{Main|McMartin preschool trial}}

The McMartin Preschool case was the first daycare abuse case to receive major media attention in the United States.&lt;ref name="CAV"/&gt; The case centered upon the McMartin Preschool in [[Manhattan Beach, California]], where seven teachers were accused of kidnapping children, flying them in a plane to another location, and forcing them to engage in group sex as well as forcing them to watch [[Cruelty to animals|animals be tortured and killed]].&lt;ref name="CAV"/&gt; The case also involved accusations that children had been forced to participate in bizarre religious rituals, and been used to make child pornography.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt; The case began with a single accusation, made by the mother - who was later found to be a paranoid schizophrenic&lt;ref name=Peggy&gt;{{cite news |first=Margaret |last=Talbot |authorlink= |title=The Lives They Lived: 01-07-01: Peggy McMartin Buckey, b. 1926; The Devil in The Nursery. |url=http://www.newamerica.net/publications/articles/2001/the_devil_in_the_nursery |format=reprint from New America |quote=Buckey's ordeal began in 1983, when the mother of a 2½-year-old who attended the McMartin preschool in [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]], [[California]], called the police to report that her son had been sodomized there. It didn't matter that the woman was eventually found to be a paranoid schizophrenic, and that the accusations she made – of teachers who took children on airplane rides to Palm Springs and lured them into a labyrinth of underground tunnels where the accused "flew in the air" and others were "all dressed up as witches" ... |publisher=The New York Times |date=January 7, 2001 |accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; - of one of the students, but grew rapidly when investigators informed parents of the accusation and began interviewing other students.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt; The case made headlines nationwide in 1984, and seven teachers were arrested and charged that year.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt; When a new district attorney took over the case in 1986, however, his office re-examined the evidence and dropped charges against all but two of the original defendants. Their trials became one of the longest and most expensive criminal trials in the history of the United States,&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; but in 1990 all of these charges were also dropped.&lt;ref name="CAV"/&gt; Both jurors at the trial and academic researchers later criticized the interviewing techniques that investigators had used in their investigations of the school, alleging that interviewers had "coaxed" children into making unfounded accusations, repeatedly asking children the same questions and offering various incentives until the children reported having been abused.&lt;ref name="CAV"/&gt; Most scholars now agree that the accusations these interviews elicited from children were false.&lt;ref name="Schreiber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garven"/&gt; Sociologist [[Mary de Young]] and historian [[Philip Jenkins]] have both cited the McMartin case as the prototype for a wave of similar accusations and investigations between 1983 and 1995, which constituted a moral panic.&lt;ref name="de Young"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;

===Country Walk===
In 1985, Frank Fuster – the owner of the Country Walk Babysitting Service in the [[Country Walk, Florida|Country Walk]] suburb of [[Miami|Miami, Florida]] – was found guilty of 14 counts of abuse.&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt; He was sentenced to prison with a minimum length of 165 years. Fuster's alleged victims testified that he led them in Satanic rituals and terrorized them by forcing them to watch him mutilate birds, a lesson to children who might reveal the abuse.&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite news |last=Collins |first=Glen |title=Nightmare in Country Walk |publisher=The New York Times |date=1986-12-14 |quote=Mr. Fuster was convicted of molesting the children entrusted to his wife's care in their home in the middle-class Dade County suburb of Country Walk, a planned development that was intended to be an idyllic refuge from the anxieties of urban Miami. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/14/books/nightmare-in-country-walk.html?pagewanted=print |accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuster had been previously convicted for manslaughter and for molesting a 9-year-old child.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; Testimony from children in the case was elicited by [[University of Miami]] [[child psychologist]]s Laurie and Joseph Braga, who resorted to coercive questioning of the alleged victims when the desired answers were not forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=De Young, Mary |authorlink=Mary de Young |title=The day care ritual abuse moral panic |publisher=McFarland |location=Jefferson, N.C |year=2004 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_e8ZkJBtz0EC&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 71] |isbn=978-0-7864-1830-5 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuster's wife recanted her court testimony in an interview with Frontline, saying that she had been kept naked in solitary confinement and subjected to other forms of physical and psychological duress until she had agreed to testify against her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/fuster/etc/video.html|title=Did Daddy Do It|publisher=PBS|transcript=Transcript|transcript-url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/fuster/etc/script.html|date=April 25, 2002|series=Frontline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was prosecuted by Dade County state's attorney [[Janet Reno]].&lt;ref name=pbs2&gt;{{cite web |title=Was Fuster a Monster?: A Summary of the Frank Fuster "Country Walk" Case |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/fuster/frank/summary.html |work=Frontline |accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2017, Fuster continues to serve a 165-year prison sentence.&lt;ref name=pbs2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=flyer&gt;{{cite web |title=Florida Department of Law Enforcement – Sexual Offender / Predator Flyer |url=http://offender.fdle.state.fl.us/offender/flyer.do?personId=58857 |accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident also inspired a book and made-for-TV movie called ''Unspeakable Acts'' (1990).

===Fells Acres Day Care Center===
{{Main|Fells Acres Day Care Center preschool trial}}

In April 1984, [[Gerald Amirault]] was arrested and charged with abusing children in his care at the Fells Acres Day Care Center in [[Malden, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Beck2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Beck|title=We Believe the Children: A Moral Panic in the 1980s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x99-BAAAQBAJ|date=4 August 2015|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-61039-288-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nation"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/finality-or-justice/ |title='Finality' or Justice? |first=Katha |last=Pollitt |date=18 September 1999 |magazine=The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Gerald changed the pants on a young boy who had wet himself, the boy's mother, uncle and therapist questioned him over a period of months, until the boy alleged that Gerald had been sexually abusing him. The boy's mother then called a child abuse hotline to report that her son had been sexually abused, and Gerald was arrested shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="Rabinowitz2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/30/us/day-care-workers-get-retrial-as-accusers-did-not-face-them.html |url-access=subscription |title=Day Care Workers Get Retrial, As Accusers Did Not Face Them |agency=The Associated Press |newspaper=The New York Times |date=30 August 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nation"/&gt; In the 1986 trial, Gerald was convicted of assaulting and raping nine children and sentenced to thirty to forty years in state prison. In a separate trial, his mother, Violet Amirault, and sister, Cheryl Amirault LeFave, were also convicted of similar charges and sentenced to jail for eight to 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Day Care Workers Get Retrial, As Accusers Did Not Face Them. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/30/us/day-care-workers-get-retrial-as-accusers-did-not-face-them.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=August 30, 1995 |accessdate=2008-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richard Beck, the case developed "in the usual way" compared to other moral panic cases, with more and more children leveling increasingly bizarre allegations against the accused during the course of the investigation.&lt;ref name="Beck2015"/&gt; The allegations included reports of "bad clowns," robots, "magic rooms," and tortured animals.&lt;ref name="ATC"&gt;"Profile: Case of Gerald Amirault, a convicted child sex offender, and the prosecution of child sexual molestation cases." All Things Considered, April 19, 2000.

In 1995, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' journalist [[Dorothy Rabinowitz]] questioned testimony from the children that had been elicited with dubious interrogation techniques, writing, "no sane person reading the transcripts of these interrogations can doubt the wholesale fabrications of evidence on which this case was built."&lt;ref name=darkness&gt;{{cite news |first=Dorothy |last=Rabinowitz |authorlink=Dorothy Rabinowitz |title=A Darkness in Massachusetts |url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=95000779|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303131406/http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=95000779|archive-date=March 3, 2009 |quote=On Labor Day 1984, 60-year-old Violet Amirault, proprietor of the thriving Fells Acres Day School in [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]], [[Massachusetts]], received a call about a child-abuse accusation against her son.

===Bernard Baran===

On October 4, 1984, a drug addicted couple acting as police informants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Video helps clear convict of abuse after 21 years. |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32341725/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/ |agency=The Associated Press |work=MSNBC |date=2009-08-09 |quote=The first complaint came from a drug addicted couple.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Berman |first=D. |last2=Lock |first2=C. |last3=Rainey |first3=R. |last4=Taub |first4=L. |date=2004-06-24 |url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/top/features/documents/03917095.asp |title=The Trials of Bernard Baran |newspaper=[[Boston Phoenix|The Boston Phoenix]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612171804/http://bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/top/features/documents/03917095.asp |archive-date=2010-06-12 |quote='It was a way of life,' Joe Hill acknowledged in court documents, 'Nembutal, Seconal, Percodan, Heroin, cocaine, Methedrine.

The child had been attending the government operated Early Childhood Development Center (ECDC) where Baran, an openly gay 19-year-old, worked as a teacher's aide. The accusers had previously complained to the board of directors that they "didn't want no homo" around their son.&lt;ref&gt;Superior Court Criminal Action No. 18042-51. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts versus Bernard F. Baran, Jr. Memorandum of Decision and Order on Defendant's Motion For A New Trial. 2006-06-21. Background, p. 6. "In 1984, Bernard Baran worked at the Early Childhood Development Center ('ECDC') as a teacher's aide. The allegations in this case emanate from his contact with pre-school children who were enrolled in this facility. The first family to bring accusations against Mr. Baran was that of Boy A. Previously, the boy's father had filed a complaint with ECDC objecting to Mr. Baran being allowed to work with children because he was a homosexual. On September 12th, 1984, the ECDC Board of Directors discussed Mr. Baran's sexuality and his possible termination. On October 5th, 1984, this family contacted the police to report that Mr. Baran had molested their child."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Video helps clear convict of abuse after 21 years." http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32341725/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/ Associated Press / MSNBC. 2009-08-09. His case had followed a tortured path – the first complaint came from a drug-addicted couple, acting as narcotics informants, who told their police connection they "didn't want no homo" watching their son.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within days of the first allegation, ECDC hosted a puppet show and delivered letters to parents notifying them about a child at the day care with [[gonorrhea]]. Five other allegations emerged. Baran was tried in the Berkshire County courthouse 105 days after the first allegation, a swiftness noted in the later court rulings. The courtroom was closed during the children's testimony, which Baran claimed violated his right to a public trial. Baran's defense attorney was later ruled ineffective.

===Oak Hill satanic ritual abuse trial===
{{Main|Oak Hill satanic ritual abuse trial}}
Frances Keller and her husband, Dan Keller, both of [[Austin, Texas]], were convicted of sexually abusing a 3-year-old girl in their care, and they spent 21 years in prison until their release in 2013.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-texas-release-idUSBRE9AQ13R20131127|title=Texas frees daycare operator accused of 'satanic' sexual abuse|date=27 November 2013|publisher=|via=Reuters|newspaper=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case began on August 15, 1991, when a 3-year-old girl told her mother that Dan Keller had hurt her. The mother and daughter were on their way to a scheduled appointment with the girl’s therapist, who drew out details that included Keller defecating on her head and sexually assaulting her with a pen. During the time leading up to the trial, two other children from the day care offered similar accusations. According to the children, the couple served blood-laced Kool-Aid and forced them to have videotaped sex with adults and other children. The Kellers, they said, sometimes wore white robes and lit candles before hurting them. The children also accused the Kellers of forcing them to watch or participate in the killing and dismemberment of cats, dogs and a crying baby. Bodies were unearthed in cemeteries and new holes dug to hide freshly killed animals and, once, an adult passer-by was shot and dismembered with a chain saw. The children recalled several plane trips, including one to [[Mexico]], where they were sexually abused by soldiers before returning to [[Austin]] in time to meet their parents at the day care.&lt;ref name="case"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/news/local/fran-keller-to-be-freed-in-satanic-abuse-case/nb5S2/|title=Fran Keller to be freed in satanic abuse case|work=statesman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only physical evidence of abuse in the case was presented by Michael Mouw, an emergency room physician at Brackenridge Hospital who examined the 3-year-old girl in 1991 on the night she first accused Dan Keller of abuse. Mouw testified at the Kellers’ trial that he found two tears in the girl’s hymen consistent with sexual abuse and determined that the injuries were less than 24 hours old. Three years after the trial, while attending a medical seminar, Mouw said a slide presentation on “normal” pediatric hymens included a photo that was identical to what he had observed in the girl.&lt;ref name="case" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kvue.com/news/editors-pick/233691871.html Austin attorneys weigh in on why Kellers were convicted] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205081850/http://www.kvue.com/news/editors-pick/233691871.html |date=2013-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 26, 2013, the [[Travis County]] district attorney's office announced that Fran Keller, now 63, was being released on bond and her husband, Dan Keller, who was convicted at the same time, would be released within a week in a deal reached with lawyers.

[[Peter Ellis (childcare worker)|Peter Ellis]], a child-care worker at the [[Christchurch]] Civic [[Day care|Crèche]] in [[New Zealand]], was found guilty on 16 counts of sexual abuse against children in 1992 and served seven years in jail. Parents of the alleged abuse victims were entitled to claim NZ$10,000 (equivalent to about US$11,000 in 2010) in compensation for each allegation from the [[Accident Compensation Corporation]], regardless of whether the allegations were proved or not. Many victims' families made multiple allegations. Four female co-workers were also arrested on 15 charges of abuse, but were released after these charges were dropped. Together with six other co-workers who lost their jobs when the centre was closed, they were awarded $1 million in compensation by the Employment Court in 1995, although this sum was reduced on appeal.

* During the 1980s a series of highly publicized “daycare ritual abuse cases” erupted in communities across the United States and Europe. The cases typically involved allegations by preschool children that they had been terrorized and sexually abused by day-care workers in bizarre scenarios with Satanic or ritualistic overtones. Some scholars continue to take the view that these cases were genuine and involved actual ritual abuse (Faller, 1996; Summit, 1994). However, skepticism has become widespread among research psychologists. An extensive body of research, arising in the wake of the day-care cases of the 1980s, has identified a variety of interviewing techniques that can induce children to make false reports.

Supposed victims were questioned, until they confirmed the charges and offered their own creative embellishments."
* "Most day care and preschool prosecutions resulted in either the acquittal of the accused or the conviction of some individuals on counts that involved neither satanic nor ritualistic elements. Even these convictions were often overturned when appeals courts examined the means by which testimony had been elicited from children."

Many social scientists, scholars, and legal authorities now view the stories of Satanic conspiracy that circulated in the 1980s as urban legends, and the daycare abuse cases as historical aberrations...

{{Continuum mechanics |solid}}

'''Deformation''' in [[continuum mechanics]] is the transformation of a body from a ''reference'' configuration to a ''current'' configuration.&lt;ref name=Truesdell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Truesdell |first1=C. |last2=Noll |first2=W. |year=2004 |title=The non-linear field theories of mechanics |edition=3rd |publisher=Springer |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A configuration is a set containing the positions of all particles of the body.

A  deformation may be caused by [[structural load|external loads]],&lt;ref name=wu&gt;{{cite book|first=H.-C. |last=Wu |title=Continuum Mechanics and Plasticity |publisher=CRC Press |date=2005 |ISBN=1-58488-363-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[body force]]s (such as [[gravity]] or [[electromagnetic force]]s), or changes in temperature, moisture content, or chemical reactions, etc.

Strain is a description of deformation in terms of ''relative'' displacement of particles in the body that excludes rigid-body motions.  Different equivalent choices may be made for the expression of a strain field depending on whether it is defined with respect to the initial or the final configuration of the body and on whether the [[metric tensor]] or its dual is considered.

In a continuous body, a deformation field results from a [[Stress (physics)|stress]] field induced by applied [[force]]s or is due to changes in the temperature field inside the body. The relation between stresses and induced strains is expressed by [[constitutive equations]], e.g., [[Hooke's law]] for [[Linear elasticity|linear elastic]] materials. Deformations which are recovered after the stress field has been removed are called '''elastic deformations'''. In this case, the continuum completely recovers its original configuration. On the other hand, irreversible deformations remain even after stresses have been removed. One type of irreversible deformation is '''plastic deformation''', which occurs in material bodies after stresses have attained a certain threshold value known as the ''elastic limit'' or [[Yield (engineering)|yield stress]], and are the result of [[Slip (materials science)|slip]], or [[dislocation]] mechanisms at the atomic level. Another type of irreversible deformation is '''viscous deformation''', which is the irreversible part of [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] deformation.

In the case of elastic deformations, the response function linking strain to the deforming stress is the [[Hooke's law#tensor expression|compliance tensor]] of the material.

==Strain==
{{see also|Stress measures|Strain rate}}
Strain is a measure of deformation representing the displacement between particles in the body relative to a reference length.

A general deformation of a body can be expressed in the form {{math|'''x''' {{=}} '''''F'''''('''X''')}} where {{math|'''X'''}} is the reference position of material points in the body.  Such a measure does not distinguish between rigid body motions (translations and rotations) and changes in shape (and size) of the body.  A deformation has units of length.

We could, for example, define strain to be
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \doteq \cfrac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{X}}\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{X}\right)
     = \boldsymbol{F}'- \boldsymbol{I},
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|'''I'''}} is the [[Identity matrix|identity tensor]].
Hence strains are dimensionless and are usually expressed as a [[decimal|decimal fraction]], a [[percentage]] or in [[parts-per notation]]. Strains measure how much a given deformation differs locally from a rigid-body deformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A strain is in general a [[tensor]] quantity.  Physical insight into strains can be gained by observing that a given strain can be decomposed into normal and shear components.  The amount of stretch or compression along material line elements or fibers is the ''normal strain'', and the amount of distortion associated with the sliding of plane layers over each other is the ''shear strain'', within a deforming body.&lt;ref name=rees&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be applied by elongation, shortening, or volume changes, or angular distortion.&lt;ref&gt;"Earth."Encyclopædia Britannica from [[Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] .[2009].&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of strain at a [[Continuum mechanics|material point]] of a continuum body is defined as the totality of all the changes in length of material lines or fibers, the ''normal strain'', which pass through that point and also the totality of all the changes in the angle between pairs of lines initially perpendicular to each other, the ''shear strain'', radiating from this point. However, it is sufficient to know the normal and shear components of strain on a set of three mutually perpendicular directions.

If there is an increase in length of the material line, the normal strain is called ''tensile strain'', otherwise, if there is reduction or compression in the length of the material line, it is called ''compressive strain''.

===Strain measures===
Depending on the amount of strain, or local deformation, the analysis of deformation is subdivided into three deformation theories:
* [[Finite strain theory]], also called ''large strain theory'', ''large deformation theory'', deals with deformations in which both rotations and strains are arbitrarily large. In this case, the undeformed and deformed configurations of the [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]] are significantly different and a clear distinction has to be made between them. This is commonly the case with [[elastomer]]s, [[Plasticity (physics)|plastically-deforming]] materials and other [[fluid]]s and biological [[soft tissue]].
* [[Infinitesimal strain theory]], also called ''small strain theory'', ''small deformation theory'', ''small displacement theory'', or ''small displacement-gradient theory'' where strains and rotations are both small. In this case, the undeformed and deformed configurations of the body can be assumed identical. The infinitesimal strain theory is used in the analysis of deformations of materials exhibiting [[Deformation (engineering)#Elastic deformation|elastic]] behavior, such as materials found in mechanical and civil engineering applications, e.g. concrete and steel.
* ''Large-displacement'' or ''large-rotation theory'', which assumes small strains but large rotations and displacements.

In each of these theories the strain is then defined differently. The ''engineering strain'' is the most common definition applied to materials used in mechanical and structural engineering, which are subjected to very small deformations. On the other hand, for some materials, e.g. [[elastomers]] and polymers, subjected to large deformations, the engineering definition of strain is not applicable, e.g. typical engineering strains greater than 1%,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Rees| first = David| title = Basic Engineering Plasticity: An Introduction with Engineering and Manufacturing Applications| publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann| year = 2006| page = 41| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4KWbmn_1hcYC| isbn = 0-7506-8025-3| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171222205706/https://books.google.com/books?id=4KWbmn_1hcYC| archivedate = 2017-12-22| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus other more complex definitions of strain are required, such as ''stretch'', ''logarithmic strain'', ''Green strain'', and ''Almansi strain''.

====Engineering strain====
The '''Cauchy strain''' or '''engineering strain''' is expressed as the ratio of total deformation to the initial dimension of the material body in which the forces are being applied. The ''engineering normal strain'' or ''engineering extensional strain'' or ''nominal strain'' {{mvar|e}} of a material line element or fiber axially loaded is expressed as the change in length {{math|Δ''L''}} per unit of the original length {{mvar|L}} of the line element or fibers. The normal strain is positive if the material fibers are stretched and negative if they are compressed. Thus, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\ e=\frac{\Delta L}{L}=\frac{l -L}{L}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|e}} is the ''engineering normal strain'', {{mvar|L}} is the original length of the fiber and {{mvar|l}} is the final length of the fiber. Measures of strain are often expressed in parts per million or microstrains.

The ''true shear strain'' is defined as the change in the angle (in radians) between two material line elements initially perpendicular to each other in the undeformed or initial configuration. The ''engineering shear strain'' is defined as the tangent of that angle, and is equal to the length of deformation at its maximum divided by the perpendicular length in the plane of force application which sometimes makes it easier to calculate.

====Stretch ratio====
The '''stretch ratio''' or '''extension ratio''' is a measure of the extensional or normal strain of a differential line element, which can be defined at either the undeformed configuration or the deformed configuration. It is defined as the ratio between the final length {{mvar|l}} and the initial length {{mvar|L}} of the material line.

:&lt;math&gt;\ \lambda=\frac{l}{L}&lt;/math&gt;

The extension ratio is approximately related to the engineering strain by

:&lt;math&gt;\ e=\frac{l-L}{L}=\lambda-1&lt;/math&gt;

This equation implies that the normal strain is zero, so that there is no deformation when the stretch is equal to unity.

The stretch ratio is used in the analysis of materials that exhibit large deformations, such as elastomers, which can sustain stretch ratios of 3 or 4 before they fail. On the other hand, traditional engineering materials, such as concrete or steel, fail at much lower stretch ratios.

====True strain====
The '''logarithmic strain''' {{mvar|ε}}, also called, ''true strain'' or ''Hencky strain'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hencky|first=H.|date=1928|title=Über die Form des Elastizitätsgesetzes bei ideal elastischen Stoffen|url=|journal=Zeitschrift für technische Physik|volume=9|pages=215–220|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Considering an incremental strain (Ludwik)

: &lt;math&gt;\ \delta \varepsilon=\frac{\delta l}{l}&lt;/math&gt;

the logarithmic strain is obtained by integrating this incremental strain:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \begin{align}
\int\delta \varepsilon &amp;=\int_{L}^{l}\frac{\delta l}{l}\\
\varepsilon&amp;=\ln\left(\frac{l}{L}\right)=\ln (\lambda) \\
&amp;=\ln(1+e) \\
&amp;=e-\frac{e^2}{2}+\frac{e^3}{3}- \cdots \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|e}} is the engineering strain. The logarithmic strain provides the correct measure of the final strain when deformation takes place in a series of increments, taking into account the influence of the strain path.&lt;ref name=rees/&gt;

====Green strain====
{{main|Finite strain theory#Finite strain tensors|l1=Finite strain theory}}
The Green strain is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \varepsilon_G=\tfrac{1}{2}\left(\frac{l^2-L^2}{L^2}\right)=\tfrac{1}{2}(\lambda^2-1)&lt;/math&gt;

====Almansi strain====
{{main|Finite strain theory#Finite strain tensors|l1=Finite strain theory}}
The Euler-Almansi strain is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\ \varepsilon_E=\tfrac{1}{2}\left(\frac{l^2-L^2}{l^2}\right)=\tfrac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{1}{\lambda^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Normal and shear strain===
[[File:2D geometric strain.svg|350px|right|thumb|Two-dimensional geometric deformation of an infinitesimal material element.]]

Strains are classified as either ''normal'' or ''shear''. A ''normal strain'' is perpendicular to the face of an element, and a ''shear strain'' is parallel to it. These definitions are consistent with those of [[normal stress]] and [[shear stress]].

====Normal strain====
For an [[isotropic]] material that obeys [[Hooke's law]], a [[normal stress]] will cause a normal strain. Normal strains produce ''dilations''.

Consider a two-dimensional, infinitesimal, rectangular material element with dimensions {{math|''dx'' × ''dy''}}, which, after deformation, takes the form of a [[rhombus]]. From the geometry of the adjacent figure we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathrm{length}(AB) = dx \,
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathrm{length}(ab) &amp;= \sqrt{\left(dx+\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}dx \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}dx \right)^2} \\
&amp;= dx~\sqrt{1+2\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}+\left(\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}\right)^2} \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
For very small displacement gradients the squares of the derivatives are negligible and we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathrm{length}(ab)\approx dx +\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}dx
 &lt;/math&gt;
The normal strain in the {{mvar|x}}-direction of the rectangular element is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;
  \varepsilon_x = \frac{\text{extension}}{\text{original length}} = \frac{\mathrm{length}(ab)-\mathrm{length}(AB)}{\mathrm{length}(AB)}
     = \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the normal strain in the {{mvar|y}}- and {{mvar|z}}-directions becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_y = \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y} \quad , \qquad  \varepsilon_z = \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

====Shear strain====
{{Infobox Physical quantity
| bgcolour =
| name = Shear strain
| image =
| caption =
| unit = [[dimensionless|1]], or [[radian]]
| symbols = [[Gamma|{{mvar|γ}}]] or [[Epsilon|{{mvar|ε}}]]
| derivations = {{math|''γ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|[[Shear stress|''τ'']]|[[Shear modulus|''G'']]}}}}
}}
The engineering shear strain ({{math|''γ&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;''}}) is defined as the change in angle between lines {{overline|''AC''}} and {{overline|''AB''}}.  Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \gamma_{xy}= \alpha + \beta\,\!
 &lt;/math&gt;

From the geometry of the figure, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
    \tan \alpha &amp; =\frac{\tfrac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}dx}{dx+\tfrac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}dx}=\frac{\tfrac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}}{1+\tfrac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}} \\
    \tan \beta &amp; =\frac{\tfrac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}dy}{dy+\tfrac{\partial u_y}{\partial y}dy}=\frac{\tfrac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}}{1+\tfrac{\partial u_y}{\partial y}}
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
For small displacement gradients we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} \ll 1 ~;~~ \cfrac{\partial u_y}{\partial y} \ll 1
 &lt;/math&gt;
For small rotations, i.e. {{mvar|α}} and {{mvar|β}} are ≪ 1 we have {{math|tan ''α'' ≈ ''α''}}, {{math|tan ''β'' ≈ ''β''}}. Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \alpha \approx \cfrac{\partial u_y}{\partial x} ~;~~ \beta \approx \cfrac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}
 &lt;/math&gt;
thus

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{xy}= \alpha + \beta = \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
By interchanging {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} and {{math|''u&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''u&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, it can be shown that {{math|''γ&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''γ&lt;sub&gt;yx&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

Similarly, for the {{mvar|yz}}- and {{mvar|xz}}-planes, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{yz}=\gamma_{zy} = \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial y} \quad , \qquad \gamma_{zx}=\gamma_{xz}= \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial z}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The tensorial shear strain components of the infinitesimal strain tensor can then be expressed using the engineering strain definition, {{mvar|γ}}, as

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}} = \left[\begin{matrix}
\varepsilon_{xx} &amp; \varepsilon_{xy} &amp; \varepsilon_{xz} \\
   \varepsilon_{yx} &amp; \varepsilon_{yy} &amp; \varepsilon_{yz} \\
   \varepsilon_{zx} &amp; \varepsilon_{zy} &amp; \varepsilon_{zz} \\
  \end{matrix}\right] = \left[\begin{matrix}
\varepsilon_{xx} &amp; \tfrac12\gamma_{xy} &amp; \tfrac12\gamma_{xz} \\
   \tfrac12\gamma_{yx} &amp; \varepsilon_{yy} &amp; \tfrac12\gamma_{yz} \\
   \tfrac12\gamma_{zx} &amp; \tfrac12\gamma_{zy} &amp; \varepsilon_{zz} \\
  \end{matrix}\right]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

===Metric tensor===
{{main|Finite strain theory#Deformation tensors in curvilinear coordinates}}
A strain field associated with a displacement is defined, at any point, by the change in length of the [[tangent vector]]s representing the speeds of arbitrarily [[parametrized curves]] passing through that point.  A basic geometric result, due to [[Maurice Fréchet|Fréchet]], [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] and [[Pascual Jordan|Jordan]], states that, if the lengths of the tangent vectors fulfil the axioms of a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] and the [[parallelogram law]], then the length of a vector is the square root of the value of the [[quadratic form]] associated, by the [[polarization formula]], with a [[positive definite]] [[bilinear map]] called the [[metric tensor]].

==Description of deformation==
Deformation is the change in the metric properties of a continuous body, meaning that a curve drawn in the initial body placement changes its length when displaced to a curve in the final placement. If none of the curves changes length, it is said that a [[rigid body]] displacement occurred.

It is convenient to identify a reference configuration or initial geometric state of the continuum body which all subsequent configurations are referenced from. The reference configuration need not be one the body actually will ever occupy. Often, the configuration at {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}} is considered the reference configuration, {{math|''κ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''B''')}}. The configuration at the current time {{mvar|t}} is the ''current configuration''.

For deformation analysis, the reference configuration is identified as ''undeformed configuration'', and the current configuration as ''deformed configuration''. Additionally, time is not considered when analyzing deformation, thus the sequence of configurations between the undeformed and deformed configurations are of no interest.

The components {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the position vector {{math|'''X'''}} of a particle in the reference configuration, taken with respect to the reference coordinate system, are called the ''material or reference coordinates''. On the other hand, the components {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the position vector {{math|'''x'''}} of a particle in the deformed configuration, taken with respect to the spatial coordinate system of reference, are called the ''spatial coordinates''

There are two methods for analysing the deformation of a continuum. One description is made in terms of the material or referential coordinates, called [[Continuum mechanics|material description or Lagrangian description]]. A second description is of deformation is made in terms of the spatial coordinates it is called the [[Continuum mechanics|spatial description or Eulerian description]].

There is continuity during deformation of a continuum body in the sense that:
* The material points forming a closed curve at any instant will always form a closed curve at any subsequent time.
* The material points forming a closed surface at any instant will always form a closed surface at any subsequent time and the matter within the closed surface will always remain within.

===Affine deformation===
A deformation is called an affine deformation if it can be described by an [[affine transformation]].  Such a transformation is composed of a [[linear transformation]] (such as rotation, shear, extension and compression) and a rigid body translation.  Affine deformations are also called homogeneous deformations.&lt;ref name=Ogden&gt;{{cite book|last=Ogden|first=R. W.|date=1984|title=Non-linear Elastic Deformations|publisher=Dover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, an affine deformation has the form
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{x}(\mathbf{X},t) = \boldsymbol{F}(t)\cdot\mathbf{X} + \mathbf{c}(t)
 &lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''x'''}} is the position of a point in the deformed configuration, {{math|'''X'''}} is the position in a reference configuration, {{mvar|t}} is a time-like parameter, {{mvar|'''F'''}} is the linear transformer and {{math|'''c'''}} is the translation.  In matrix form, where the components are with respect to an orthonormal basis,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{bmatrix}     x_1(X_1,X_2,X_3,t) \\ x_2(X_1,X_2,X_3,t) \\ x_3(X_1,X_2,X_3,t)    \end{bmatrix}
   = \begin{bmatrix}
     F_{11}(t) &amp; F_{12}(t) &amp; F_{13}(t) \\ F_{21}(t) &amp; F_{22}(t) &amp; F_{23}(t) \\ F_{31}(t) &amp; F_{32}(t) &amp; F_{33}(t)
   \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}     X_1 \\ X_2 \\ X_3   \end{bmatrix} +
   \begin{bmatrix}     c_1(t) \\ c_2(t) \\ c_3(t)    \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;

The above deformation becomes ''non-affine'' or ''inhomogeneous'' if {{math|'''''F''''' {{=}} '''''F'''''('''X''',''t'')}} or {{math|'''c''' {{=}} '''c'''('''X''',''t'')}}.

===Rigid body motion===
A rigid body motion is a special affine deformation that does not involve any shear, extension or compression.  The transformation matrix {{mvar|'''F'''}} is [[orthogonal matrix|proper orthogonal]] in order to allow rotations but no [[reflection (mathematics)|reflections]].

A rigid body motion can be described by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{x}(\mathbf{X},t) = \boldsymbol{Q}(t)\cdot\mathbf{X} + \mathbf{c}(t)
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
 \boldsymbol{Q}\cdot\boldsymbol{Q}^T = \boldsymbol{Q}^T \cdot \boldsymbol{Q} = \boldsymbol{\mathit{1}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
In matrix form,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{bmatrix}     x_1(X_1,X_2,X_3,t) \\ x_2(X_1,X_2,X_3,t) \\ x_3(X_1,X_2,X_3,t)    \end{bmatrix}
   = \begin{bmatrix}
     Q_{11}(t) &amp; Q_{12}(t) &amp; Q_{13}(t) \\ Q_{21}(t) &amp; Q_{22}(t) &amp; Q_{23}(t) \\ Q_{31}(t) &amp; Q_{32}(t) &amp; Q_{33}(t)
   \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}     X_1 \\ X_2 \\ X_3   \end{bmatrix} +
   \begin{bmatrix}     c_1(t) \\ c_2(t) \\ c_3(t)    \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;

==Displacement==
[[File:Displacement of a continuum.svg|400px|right|thumb|Figure 1. Motion of a continuum body.]]
A change in the configuration of a continuum body results in a [[displacement field (mechanics)|displacement]]. The displacement of a body has two components: a rigid-body displacement and a deformation. A rigid-body displacement consists of a simultaneous translation and rotation of the body without changing its shape or size. Deformation implies the change in shape and/or size of the body from an initial or undeformed configuration {{math|''κ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''B''')}} to a current or deformed configuration {{math|''κ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''('''B''')}} (Figure 1).

If after a displacement of the continuum there is a relative displacement between particles, a deformation has occurred. On the other hand, if after displacement of the continuum the relative displacement between particles in the current configuration is zero, then there is no deformation and a rigid-body displacement is said to have occurred.

The vector joining the positions of a particle ''P'' in the undeformed configuration and deformed configuration is called the [[displacement (vector)|displacement vector]] {{math|'''u'''('''X''',''t'') {{=}} ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the Lagrangian description, or {{math|'''U'''('''x''',''t'') {{=}} ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''J''&lt;/sub&gt;'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;''J''&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the Eulerian description.

A ''displacement field'' is a vector field of all displacement vectors for all particles in the body, which relates the deformed configuration with the undeformed configuration. It is convenient to do the analysis of deformation or motion of a continuum body in terms of the displacement field. In general, the displacement field is expressed in terms of the material coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf u(\mathbf X,t) = \mathbf b(\mathbf X,t)+\mathbf x(\mathbf X,t) - \mathbf X \qquad \text{or}\qquad u_i = \alpha_{iJ}b_J + x_i - \alpha_{iJ}X_J&lt;/math&gt;

or in terms of the spatial coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf U(\mathbf x,t) = \mathbf b(\mathbf x,t)+\mathbf x - \mathbf X(\mathbf x,t) \qquad \text{or}\qquad U_J = b_J + \alpha_{Ji}x_i - X_J \,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''α&lt;sub&gt;Ji&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are the direction cosines between the material and spatial coordinate systems with unit vectors {{math|'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;''J''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, respectively. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf E_J \cdot \mathbf e_i = \alpha_{Ji}=\alpha_{iJ}&lt;/math&gt;

and the relationship between {{math|''u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''U&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is then given by

:&lt;math&gt;\ u_i=\alpha_{iJ}U_J \qquad \text{or} \qquad U_J=\alpha_{Ji}u_i&lt;/math&gt;

Knowing that
:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf e_i = \alpha_{iJ}\mathbf E_J&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u(\mathbf X,t)=u_i\mathbf e_i=u_i(\alpha_{iJ}\mathbf E_J)=U_J\mathbf E_J=\mathbf U(\mathbf x,t)&lt;/math&gt;

It is common to superimpose the coordinate systems for the undeformed and deformed configurations, which results in {{math|'''b''' {{=}} 0}}, and the direction cosines become [[Kronecker delta]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf E_J \cdot \mathbf e_i = \delta_{Ji}=\delta_{iJ}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf u(\mathbf X,t) = \mathbf x(\mathbf X,t) - \mathbf X \qquad \text{or}\qquad u_i = x_i - \delta_{iJ}X_J = x_i - X_i &lt;/math&gt;

or in terms of the spatial coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf U(\mathbf x,t) = \mathbf x - \mathbf X(\mathbf x,t) \qquad \text{or}\qquad U_J = \delta_{Ji}x_i - X_J =x_J - X_J&lt;/math&gt;

===Displacement gradient tensor===
The partial differentiation of the displacement vector with respect to the material coordinates yields the ''material displacement gradient tensor'' {{math|'''∇&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;U'''}}. Thus we have:

:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X},t) &amp; = \mathbf{x}(\mathbf{X},t) - \mathbf{X} \\
 \nabla_\mathbf{X}\mathbf{u} &amp; = \nabla_\mathbf{X}\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{I} \\
 \nabla_\mathbf{X}\mathbf{u} &amp; = \mathbf{F} - \mathbf{I} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
||      or    
|| &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
u_i &amp; = x_i - \delta_{iJ} X_J = x_i - X_i\\
\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X_K} &amp; = \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial X_K}-\delta_{iK} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

where {{math|'''F'''}} is the ''deformation gradient tensor''.

Similarly, the partial differentiation of the displacement vector with respect to the spatial coordinates yields the ''spatial displacement gradient tensor'' {{math|'''∇&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;U'''}}. Thus we have,

:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\mathbf U(\mathbf x,t) &amp;= \mathbf x - \mathbf X(\mathbf x,t) \\
\nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf U &amp;= \mathbf I - \nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf X \\
\nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf U &amp;= \mathbf I -\mathbf F^{-1}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
||      or    
|| &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
U_J&amp; = \delta_{Ji}x_i-X_J =x_J - X_J\\
\frac{\partial U_J}{\partial x_k} &amp;= \delta_{Jk}-\frac{\partial X_J}{\partial x_k}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Examples of deformations==
Homogeneous (or affine) deformations are useful in elucidating the behavior of materials.  Some homogeneous deformations of interest are
* [[uniform extension]]
* [[pure dilation]]
* [[equibiaxial tension]]
* [[simple shear]]
* [[pure shear]]
Plane deformations are also of interest, particularly in the experimental context.

===Plane deformation===
A plane deformation, also called ''plane strain'', is one where the deformation is restricted to one of the planes in the reference configuration.  If the deformation is restricted to the plane described by the basis vectors {{math|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the [[deformation gradient]] has the form
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{F} = F_{11}\mathbf{e}_1\otimes\mathbf{e}_1 + F_{12}\mathbf{e}_1\otimes\mathbf{e}_2 + F_{21}\mathbf{e}_2\otimes\mathbf{e}_1 + F_{22}\mathbf{e}_2\otimes\mathbf{e}_2 + \mathbf{e}_3\otimes\mathbf{e}_3
 &lt;/math&gt;
In matrix form,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{F} = \begin{bmatrix} F_{11} &amp; F_{12} &amp; 0 \\ F_{21} &amp; F_{22} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
From the [[polar decomposition theorem]], the deformation gradient, up to a change of coordinates, can be decomposed into a stretch and a rotation.  Since all the deformation is in a plane, we can write&lt;ref name=Ogden/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{F} = \boldsymbol{R}\cdot\boldsymbol{U} =
     \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta &amp; \sin\theta &amp; 0 \\ -\sin\theta &amp; \cos\theta &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
     \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda_2 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|θ}} is the angle of rotation and {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the [[finite strain theory|principal stretches]].

====Isochoric plane deformation====
If the deformation is isochoric (volume preserving) then {{math|det('''''F''''') {{=}} 1}} and we have
:&lt;math&gt;
    F_{11} F_{22} - F_{12} F_{21} = 1
 &lt;/math&gt;
Alternatively,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \lambda_1\lambda_2 = 1
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Simple shear====
A [[simple shear]] deformation is defined as an isochoric plane deformation in which there is a set of line elements with a given reference orientation that do not change length and orientation during the deformation.&lt;ref name=Ogden/&gt;

If {{math|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the fixed reference orientation in which line elements do not deform during the deformation then {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 1}} and {{math|'''''F'''''·'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   F_{11}\mathbf{e}_1 + F_{21}\mathbf{e}_2 = \mathbf{e}_1 \quad \implies \quad F_{11} = 1 ~;~~ F_{21} = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
Since the deformation is isochoric,
:&lt;math&gt;
   F_{11} F_{22} - F_{12} F_{21} = 1 \quad \implies \quad F_{22} = 1
 &lt;/math&gt;
Define
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma := F_{12}\,&lt;/math&gt;
Then, the deformation gradient in simple shear can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{F} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; \gamma &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Now,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{F}\cdot\mathbf{e}_2 = F_{12}\mathbf{e}_1 + F_{22}\mathbf{e}_2 = \gamma\mathbf{e}_1 + \mathbf{e}_2
   \quad \implies \quad
   \boldsymbol{F}\cdot(\mathbf{e}_2\otimes\mathbf{e}_2) = \gamma\mathbf{e}_1\otimes\mathbf{e}_2 + \mathbf{e}_2\otimes\mathbf{e}_2
 &lt;/math&gt;
Since
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_i = \boldsymbol{\mathit{1}}&lt;/math&gt;
we can also write the deformation gradient as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{F} = \boldsymbol{\mathit{1}} +  \gamma\mathbf{e}_1\otimes\mathbf{e}_2
 &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Pink lily flower.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] symbolizes non-attachment in some religions in Asia owing to its ability to soar over the muddy waters and produce an immaculate flower.]]

'''Detachment''', also expressed as '''non-attachment''', is a state in which a person overcomes his or her attachment to desire for things, people or concepts of the world and thus attains a heightened [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]. It is considered a [[wisdom|wise]] [[virtue]] and is promoted in various Eastern religions, such as [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]].

==Importance of the term==
Detachment as release from desire and consequently from suffering is an important principle, or even ideal, in the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Stoicism]], and [[Taoism]].

In Buddhist and Hindu religious texts the opposite concept is expressed as ''[[upādāna]]'', translated as "attachment". Attachment, that is the inability to practice or embrace detachment, is viewed as the main obstacle towards a serene and fulfilled life. Many other spiritual traditions identify the lack of detachment with the continuous worries and restlessness produced by desire and personal ambitions.

==Baha'i Faith==
"Thou hast inquired about detachment. It is well known to thee that by detachment is intended the detachment of the soul from all else but God. That is, it consisteth in soaring up to an eternal station, wherein nothing that can be seen between heaven and earth deterreth the seeker from the Absolute Truth. In other words, he is not veiled from divine love or from busying himself with the mention of God by the love of any other thing or by his immersion therein."

The second definition is in the Words of Wisdom: "The essence of detachment is for man to turn his face towards the courts of the Lord, to enter His Presence, behold His Countenance, and stand as witness before Him." (Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p.&amp;nbsp;155)

==Buddhism==
{{Main|Nekkhamma}}
Regarding the concept of detachment, or non-attachment, [[Buddhist]] texts in [[Pali]] mention ''nekkhamma'', a word generally translated as "renunciation". This word also conveys more specifically the meaning of "giving up the world and leading a holy life" or "freedom from lust, craving and desires."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120707141638/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:692.pali entry for "Nekkhamma"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The writings of [[Milarepa]], are canonical [[Mahayana]] Buddhist texts that emphasize the temporary nature of the physical body and the need for non-attachment.

Detachment is a central concept in [[Zen]] Buddhist philosophy. One of the most important technical Chinese terms for detachment is ''"wú niàn"'' (無念), which literally means "no thought." This does not signify the literal absence of thought, but rather the state of being "unstained" (''bù rán'' 不染) by thought. Therefore, "detachment" is being detached from one's thoughts. It is to separate oneself from one's own thoughts and opinions in detail as to not be harmed mentally and emotionally by them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Platform_Sutra.pdf ''The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch'' translated by Philip B. Yampolsky]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
[[Eastern Christian monasticism]] cultivated practices of detached [[Watchfulness (Christian)|watchfulness]] which were designed to calm the passions and lead to an ongoing state of calm detachment known as [[apatheia]].

In Western Christianity, [[Ignatian spirituality]] encourages detachment, sometimes referred to as ''indifference'', in order to maximize a person's ''availability'' to God and to their neighbors.

==Hinduism==
The Hindu view of detachment comes from the understanding of the nature of existence and the true ultimate state sought is that of being in the moment. In other words, while one is responsible and active, one does not worry about the past or future. The detachment is towards the result of one's actions rather than towards everything in life. This concept is cited extensively within [[Puranic]] and [[Vedas|Vedic]] literature, for example:
{{Quote|One who performs his duty without attachment, surrendering the results unto the Supreme Lord, is unaffected by sinful action, as the lotus is untouched by water. |[[Bhagavad Gita]] 5.10:}}

[[Vairagya]] is a Hindu term which is often translated as detachment.

==Jainism==
Detachment is one of the supreme ideals of [[Jainism]], together with [[non-violence]]. Non-possession/Non-attachment is one of the [[Mahavrata]]s, the five great vows [[Jain muni|Jain monk]]s observe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/5vows.txt  Five Great Vows]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taoism==
The [[Tao Te Ching]] expressed the concept (in chapter 44) as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fame or Self: Which matters more?
Self or Wealth: Which is more precious?
Gain or Loss: Which is more painful?
He who is attached to things will suffer much.
He who saves will suffer heavy loss.
A contented man is rarely disappointed.
He who knows when to stop does not find himself in trouble.
He will stay forever safe.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11670">'''[[Disability]] benefits''' are funds provided from public or private sources to a person who is [[Illness|ill]] or who has a [[disability]].

==United Kingdom==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=October 2018}}
In the [[United Kingdom]] disability benefits are covered by [[Department for Work and Pensions]], and include:

* [[Disability Living Allowance]]
* [[Disability pension|Attendance Allowance]]
* [[Personal Independence Payment]]
* [[Carer's Allowance]]
* [[Employment and Support Allowance]]

==United States==
In the [[United States]], disability benefits for most Americans are covered and paid for by the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security Administration]] (a government agency). There are two main programs administered by the SSA; Social Security Disability Insurance program (SSDI) and the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. There is also a specific program for children with disabilities.

[[Social Security Disability Insurance]] provides benefits to individuals who have worked and paid Social Security taxes.

== Canada ==


In Canada, there are a variety of public [https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/disability.html Disability Benefit Programs]. The largest programs are the [[Canada Pension Plan]] and Quebec Pension Plan disability benefits, and provincial [[workers' compensation]] and [[social assistance]] programs. Some individuals, in addition, have private disability insurance coverage, purchased either individually, or through an employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/living-disability/disability-benefits.html|title=Disability benefits  - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Financial Consumer Agency of|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different programs use different rules to decide whether or not someone is eligible for benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/living-disability/disability-benefits.html|title=Disability benefits  - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Financial Consumer Agency of|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canada Pension Plan (CPP) / Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) Disability Benefits ====

To access [[Canada Pension Plan]] or the Quebec Pension Plan disability benefits, an individual needs to have a disability that is "severe and prolonged", and which prevents them from working on a regular basis. As of 2018, CPP disability benefits are a minimum of $485.20 a month. Individuals who have contributed more to CPP or QPP during their working career receive higher benefits. The average monthly CPP disability benefit was $971.23 in 2018 and the maximum monthly amount was $1,335.83.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/cpp-disability-benefit/benefit-amount.html|title=Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefit – How much could you receive - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

People receiving CPP disability benefits may earn up to $5,500 a year without losing their benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/cpp-disability-benefit/while-receiving.html |accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits stop when an individual has the ability to work regularly, or is no longer disabled. When an the individual reaches the age of 65, CPP Disability Benefits are replaced by a [https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp.html Retirement Pension].

==== Employment Insurance Sickness Benefit (EI Insurance) ====
[https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness.html Employment Insurance] is a benefit plan that offers temporary financial assistance to those individuals who cannot work due to sickness, injury, or quarantine. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - Overview - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Service|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be eligible to receive EI sickness benefits:

* The individual’s earnings have been reduced by at least 40% 
* He/She is employed in insurable employment
* A minimum of 600 hours has been accumulated in the qualifying period &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness/eligibility.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - Eligibility - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Service|date=|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People are only eligible for these benefits if they are unable to work due to their sickness, injury, or quarantine, but would be able to work otherwise. To receive EI sickness benefit a medical certificate signed by the doctor is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness/eligibility.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - Eligibility - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To qualify for EI you must have a required amount of insurable employment hours, which are used to calculate your benefit period, these insurable employment hours must be accumulated throughout the qualifying period. 

The qualifying period: 

* 52 week period before the EI claim date 
* Start date of previous EI benefit period to the start of the new date &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness/eligibility.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - Eligibility - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that each individual’s case is different and requirements may vary from case to case. But a general way of calculating EI benefits is 55% of the average insurable weekly earnings. The maximum amount you can be eligible for as of January 1 2018 is $51,700. Typically EI sickness benefits can only be paid for up to 15 weeks, but can vary depending on how long the individual is unable to work. 

Weekly EI sick benefits are calculated based on income before its been deducted during the individuals “best weeks”. Best weeks are the weeks in which the individual earned the most amount of amount, including any tips and commissions, the best weeks are chosen out of the qualifying period. 

In Canada areas with high rates of unemployment will use the best 14 weeks, and in areas with low unemployment rates will use the best 22 weeks. 

The weekly amount is calculated: 

* Calculating total earnings amount from the accumulated best weeks 
* Based on the region the individual is in the number of best weeks to use will be decided 
* Divide the total earnings by the number of best weeks 
* The result is multiplied by 55% to get the weekly benefit &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness/benefit-amount.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - How much could you receive - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you are considered a low income family you may be eligible to receive the EI Family Supplement. An individual can be considered to be a part of this category if the yearly family net income is $25, 921 or less, has children, and if the individual or their spouse receives Canada child tax benefit. If both the individual and their spouse claims EI sickness benefits only one of them can be eligible for the family supplement. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness/benefit-amount.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - How much could you receive - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''explanatory model''' is a useful description of why and how a thing works or an explanation of why a phenomenon is the way it is. The explanatory model is used as a substitute for "the&amp;nbsp;full&amp;nbsp;explanation" of the thing in question: 
* either because the full&amp;nbsp;explanation is unavailable
* or because the&amp;nbsp;full&amp;nbsp;explanation is too cumbersome to be practical in the case at hand.

Explanatory models do not claim to be a complete description/explanation of the absolute about the thing/phenomenon, nor do they even claim to, necessarily, be fully accurate. The description/explanation does, however, need to fit well enough to a sufficient portion of all the knowledge, observations and theoretical circumstances known about the thing/phenomenon, so that the explanatory model becomes useful.
That is: the description/explanation in an explanatory model, should be useful/helpful when one is about to make a decision or choice or when trying to successfully understand, explain or in some other way relate to the reality of the world around .Tewodros kassa

==Use of the term==
As most, if not all, explanations of anything, to a certain degree depend on [[axiom]]s, and thereby are incomplete and not really "the&amp;nbsp;''full''&amp;nbsp;explanation", then, strictly speaking, all explanations are in fact explanatory models.&lt;br&gt;
Yet,  the term "explanatory model" generally is used only when one feels the need to ''emphasize awareness of'' the incompleteness of an explanation (due to intentional simplification or due to lack of knowledge and understanding).

==Utility==
By being mindful of the difference between on the one hand: "absolute reality" and on the other hand: "the explanatory models that one has become accustomed to", then one will be better equipped to avoid erroneously rejecting important new knowledge, even when this new knowledge seem to clearly contradict that which one "knows" from before.

'''Flaying''', also known colloquially as [[skinning]], is a method of slow and painful execution in which [[skin]] is removed from the [[Human body|body]]. Generally, an attempt is made to keep the removed portion of skin intact.{{cn|date= October 2017}}

==Scope==
A dead animal may be flayed when preparing it to be used as human food, or for its hide or [[fur]]. This is more commonly called [[skinning]].

Flaying of humans is used as a method of [[torture]] or [[Execution (legal)|execution]], depending on how much of the skin is removed. This is often referred to as "flaying alive". There are also records of people flayed after [[death]], generally as a means of debasing the corpse of a prominent enemy or [[Crime|criminal]], sometimes related to religious beliefs (e.g. to deny an afterlife); sometimes the skin is used, again for deterrence, esotheric/ritualistic purposes, etc. (e.g. [[scalping]]).{{cn| date= October 2017}}

==Causes of death==
[[Dermatologist]] Ernst G. Jung notes that the typical causes of death due to flaying are [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], critical loss of [[blood]] or other [[body fluid]]s, [[hypothermia]], or [[infection]]s, and that the actual death is estimated to occur from a few hours up to a few days after the flaying.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LAnRRHPMmlcC&amp;pg=PA69 p.69 ''Kleine Kulturgeschichte der Haut'']. p. 69. Ernst G. Jung (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Hypothermia is possible, as skin is essential for maintaining a person's body temperature, as it provides a person's natural insulation.

==History==

=== The Assyrian tradition ===
[[File:Flaying of rebels.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Assyria]]ns flaying their prisoners alive]]
Ernst G. Jung, in his "''Kleine Kulturgeschichte der Haut''" ("A small cultural history of the skin"), provides an essay in which he outlines the [[Neo-Assyrian]] tradition of flaying human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph based on the essay "''Von Ursprung des Schindens in Assyrien''" in ''Jung'' (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=LAnRRHPMmlcC&amp;pg=PA67 p.67-70]&lt;/ref&gt; Already from the times of [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (r. 883-859 BC), the practice is displayed and commemorated in both carvings and official royal edicts. The carvings show that the actual flaying process might begin at various places on the body, such as at the [[Crus (lower leg)|crus]] (lower leg), the [[thigh]]s, or the [[buttocks]].

In their royal edicts, the Neo-Assyrian kings seem to gloat over the terrible fate they imposed upon their captives, and that flaying seems, in particular, to be the fate meted out to rebel leaders. Jung provides some examples of this triumphant rhetoric. Here are some from Ashurnasirpal II:{{quote|I have made a pillar facing the city gate, and have flayed all the rebel leaders; I have clad the pillar in the flayed skins. I let the leaders of the conquered cities be flayed, and clad the city walls with their skins. The captives I have killed by the sword and flung on the dung heap, the little boys and girls were burnt.{{Citation needed |reason=source not clear |date=November 2016}}}} 

The Rassam Cylinder, in the British Museum demonstrates this.{{quote|Their corpses they hung on stakes, they stripped off their skins and covered the city wall with them.{{sfn|Rassam Cylinder. The British Museum.|636BC|pp=Col.1, L.52 to Col.2, L. 27}}}}

=== Other examples ===
Searing or cutting the flesh from the body was sometimes used as part of the public execution of [[Treason|traitors]] in medieval Europe. A similar mode of execution was used as late as the early 18th century in France; one such episode is graphically recounted in the opening chapter of [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1979).

In 1303, the Treasury of [[Westminster Abbey]] was robbed while holding a large sum of money belonging to [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]]. After arrest and interrogation of 48 monks, three of them, including the [[Prior|subprior]] and [[Sacristan|sacrist]], were found guilty of the robbery and flayed. Their skin was attached to three doors as a warning against robbers of Church and State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Andrews |first1=William |title=The Church Treasury of History, Custom, Folk-Lore, etc. |date=1898 |publisher=Williams Andrews &amp; Co. |location=London|pages=158–167 |url=http://www.elfinspell.com/England/Andrews/TheChurchTreasury/HumanSkinOnChurchDoors.html |accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Copford]] church in Essex, England, has been found to have human skin attached to a door.&lt;ref name="Wall"&gt;Wall, J.

His story fueled the inspiration of movie characters of Norman Bates (Psycho), [[Buffalo Bill (character)|Jame Gumb "Buffalo Bill"]] (The Silence of the Lambs) and Leatherface (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre).

===Fictional===
* In [[Thomas Harris]]' novel, ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', the character [[Buffalo Bill (character)|Buffalo Bill]] is a serial killer whose ''modus operandi'' includes flaying his victims.
* In the fantasy series, ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', the Boltons of the Dreadfort flay their prisoners. The sigil of House Bolton is a flayed man. The Boltons allegedly gave up this practice 1,000 years before the series begins; however, the sadistic [[Legitimacy (family law)|bastard]] of the family, [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow/Bolton]], delights in flaying people and wants to restore its use.
* The titular monster of ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' flays its victims.
* In [[Haruki Murakami]]’s novel, ''[[The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle]]'' (1994-1995), the character Mamiya is traumatised by having witnessed a colleague being flayed to death in [[Manchukuo]], in the late 1930s.
* The opening case of the French crime thriller TV series, ''[[The Frozen Dead (TV series)|The Frozen Dead]]'' (2017), concerns a valuable horse which has been flayed and beheaded.
* In the sixth season of the [[television series]] ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]],'' the [[Witch (Buffyverse)|witch]] [[Willow Rosenberg]] notoriously used dark magic to flay [[Warren Mears]] alive in retaliation for the murder of her girlfriend, [[Tara Maclay]]. The fallout from this incident plays a significant role in Rosenberg’s arc during both the show’s seventh and final season, and in the canonical comic continuation, where Mears is revealed to have survived the incident thanks to the timely magical intervention of [[Amy Madison]].

The '''Greco-Iberian [[alphabet]]''' is a direct adaptation of an [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] variant of a [[Greek alphabet]] to the specifics of the [[Iberian language]], thus this script is an alphabet and lacks the distinctive characteristic of the rest of [[paleohispanic scripts]] that present signs with syllabic value, for the [[occlusive]]s and signs with monophonemic value for the rest of [[consonants]] and [[vowels]].

==Location of findings==
[[Image:Plom I de La Serreta (Cara B).jpg|250px|thumb|Lead plaque from la Serreta ([[Alcoi]]).]] 
The inscriptions that use the Greco-Iberian alphabet had been found mainly in [[Alicante]] and [[Murcia]] and the direction of the writing is left to right. The number of known Greco-Iberian inscriptions is small: fewer than two dozen [[ceramic]] inscriptions and a dozen [[lead]] plaques, among them the lead plaque from La Serreta ([[Alcoy (Spain)|Alcoy]], [[Alicante]]) and the lead plaque from El Cigarralejo (Mula, [[Murcia]]). The archaeological context of the Greco-Iberian inscriptions seems to concentrate in the 4th century BC, but the paleographic characteristics of the model indicate that the adaptation may date from the 5th century BC.

==Typology==
[[Image:Un alfabet greco-ibèric.jpg|thumb|250px|A Greco-Iberian alphabet]] 
The Greco-Iberian alphabet contains 16 signs identical to Greek signs, except for the sign corresponding to the second [[rhotic consonant]]: five [[vowels]], three [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] [[occlusive]]s ([[Labial consonant|labial]], [[Dental consonant|dental]] and [[velar]]), but only two [[voiceless]] occlusives (dental and velar), two [[sibilants]], two [[rhotic consonant|rhotics]], one [[Lateral consonant|lateral]], and only one [[Nasal stop|nasal]] sign. To represent the second rhotic rho gets an additional stroke. Eta is used instead of [[epsilon]] to represent /e/. The only letter not found in the modern variant of the Greek alphabet is [[sampi]]. 

The letter forms are [[petroglyph]]ic since the writing surface (ceramic, stone, lead) affords angular glyphs with straight lines.

'''Henosis''' ({{lang-grc|[[wikt:ἕνωσις|ἕνωσις]]}}) is the classical Greek word for mystical "oneness", "union" or "unity." In [[Platonism]], and especially [[Neoplatonism]], the goal of henosis is union with what is fundamental in reality: the One ([[wikt:εἷς|Τὸ  Ἕν]]), the Source, or [[Monism|Monad]].{{sfn|Stamatellos|2007|p=37}} The Neoplatonic concept has precedents in the Greek [[mystery religions]]{{sfn|Angus|1975|p=52}} as well as parallels in [[Eastern philosophy]].{{sfn|Gregorios|2002}} It is further developed in the [[Corpus Hermeticum]], in [[Christian theology]], [[Alevism]], [[soteriology]] and [[mysticism]], and is an important factor in the historical development of [[monotheism]] during [[Late Antiquity]].

==Etymology==
The term is relatively common in classical texts, and has the meaning of "union" or "unity".{{refn|group=note|LSJ entry for enosis: ἕνωσις, -εως, ἡ, (from ἑνόω "Ι unite") A. combination into one, union, Philol.10, Archyt. ap.Stob.1.41.2, Arist.Ph.222a20, GC328b22, Phld.Po.2.17, Ph.1.45, al.; “τοῦ συμφραζομένου” A.D.Synt.175.16, cf.

==Process of unification==
{{see also|Nepsis|Theoria}}

Henosis, or [[primordial unity]], is rational and deterministic, emanating from [[indeterminism]] an uncaused cause. Each individual as a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] reflects the gradual ordering of the universe referred to as the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|macrocosm]]. In mimicking the demiurge ([[Nous|divine mind]]), one unites with The One or Monad. Thus the process of unification, of "The Being" and "The One," is called henosis, the culmination of which is [[Apotheosis|deification]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==Plotinus==
{{Main|Plotinus}}

Henosis for Plotinus (204/5–270 CE) was defined in his works as a reversing of the ontological process of consciousness via [[meditation]] (in the Western mind to un[[Contemplation|contemplate]]) toward no thought ([[nous]] or [[demiurge]]) and no division ([[Dyad (symbol)|dyad]]) within the individual (being). As is specified in the writings of [[Plotinus]] on [[Henology]],{{refn|group=note|Plotinus:&lt;br&gt;* "Our thought cannot grasp the One as long as any other image remains active in the soul. To this end, you must set free your soul from all outward things and turn wholly within yourself, with no more leaning to what lies outside, and lay your mind bare of ideal forms, as before of the objects of sense, and forget even yourself, and so come within sight of that One. [6.9.7]&lt;br&gt;* "If he remembers who he became when he merged with the One, he will bear its image in himself. He was himself one, with no diversity in himself or his outward relations; for no movement was in him, no passion, no desire for another, once the ascent was accomplished. Nor indeed was there any reason or though, nor, if we dare say it, any trace of himself." [6.9.11.]}} one can reach a [[tabula rasa]], a blank state where the individual may grasp or merge with The One. This absolute simplicity means that the nous or the person is then dissolved, completely absorbed back into the Monad. 

Within the [[Enneads]] of Plotinus the Monad can be referred to as the Good above the demiurge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]] By Richard T. Wallis, Jay Bregman, [[International Society for Neoplatonic Studies]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=WSbrLPup7wYC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=Anti-Gnostic+Polemic+Francisco+Garcia+Bazan+translated+from+Spanish+by+Winifred+T.+Slater+Nous+as+a+%22Second+God%22+According+to+Plotinus+In+Enneads&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rSxQIFc5YE&amp;sig=EgX8IOF26MK-n7CoWUpDONI1sFI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA55,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John M.

All division is reconciled in the one, the final stage before reaching singularity, called duality (dyad), is completely reconciled in the Monad, Source or One (see [[monism]]). As the one, source or substance of all things the Monad is all encompassing. As infinite and indeterminate all is reconciled in the dunamis or one. It is the demiurge or second emanation that is the nous in Plotinus. It is the demiurge (creator, action, energy) or nous that "perceives" and therefore causes the force (potential or One) to manifest as energy, or the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|dyad]] called the material world. Nous as being, being and perception (intellect) manifest what is called soul ([[Anima mundi|World Soul]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]] By Richard T. Wallis, Jay Bregman, [[International Society for Neoplatonic Studies]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=WSbrLPup7wYC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=Anti-Gnostic+Polemic+Francisco+Garcia+Bazan+translated+from+Spanish+by+Winifred+T.+Slater+Nous+as+a+%22Second+God%22+According+to+Plotinus+In+Enneads&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rSxQIFc5YE&amp;sig=EgX8IOF26MK-n7CoWUpDONI1sFI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA55,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Plotinus words his teachings to reconcile not only Plato with Aristotle but also various World religions that he had personal contact with during his various travels. Plotinus' works have an [[ascetic]] character in that they reject matter as an illusion (non-existent). Matter was strictly treated as [[immanent]], with matter as essential to its being, having no true or [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendential]] character or essence, substance or ousia. This approach is called philosophical [[Idealism]].{{refn|group=note|[[Schopenhauer]] wrote of this [[Neoplatonist]] philosopher: "With [[Plotinus]] there even appears, probably for the first time in [[Western philosophy]], ''idealism'' that had long been current in the [[East]] even at that time, for it taught ([[Enneads]], iii, lib. vii, c.10) that the [[soul]] has made the [[world]] by stepping from [[eternity]] into [[time]], with the explanation: 'For there is for this [[universe]] no other place than the soul or [[mind]]' (neque est alter hujus universi locus quam anima), indeed the ideality of time is expressed in the words: 'We should not accept time outside the soul or mind' (oportet autem nequaquam extra animam tempus accipere)."&lt;ref&gt;(''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume I, "Fragments for the History of Philosophy," § 7)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Iamblichus of Chalcis==
{{see also|Greek hero cult}}

Within the works of [[Iamblichus of Chalcis]] (c. 245 – c. 325 AD), The One and reconciliation of division can be obtained through the process of [[theurgy]]. By mimicking the demiurge, the individual is returned to the cosmos to implement the will of the divine mind. One goes through a series of theurgy or [[ritual]]s that unites the initiate to the Monad. These rituals mimic the ordering of the chaos of the Universe into the material world or [[cosmos]]. They also mimic the actions of the [[demiurge]] as the creator of the material world. Iamblichus used the rituals of the mystery religions to perform rituals on the individual to unite their outer and inner person. Thus one without conflict internal or external is united (henosis) and is The One (hen).

==Eastern Orthodox Christianity==
In [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]], but also in western mysticism, ''henosis''  can be acquired by [[theoria]], [[hesychasm]] and [[Christian contemplation|contemplative prayer]]. Yet, the concept of [[Theosis (Eastern Christian theology)|theosis]], or deification, differs from henosis, since created beings cannot become God in His transcendent essence, or [[ousia]].

In medicine, the '''hygiene hypothesis''' states a lack of early childhood exposure to [[infectious agents]], [[symbiotic]] microorganisms (such as the [[gut flora]] or [[probiotic]]s), and [[parasite]]s increases susceptibility to [[allergy|allergic]] diseases by suppressing the natural development of the [[immune system]]. In particular, the lack of exposure is thought to lead to defects in the establishment of [[immune tolerance]].

The hygiene hypothesis has also been called the "[[biome]] depletion theory" and the "lost friends theory".&lt;ref name=parker&gt;{{cite web| url=http://evmedreview.com/?p=457/ |author=William Parker |title=Reconstituting the depleted biome to prevent immune disorders|publisher=The Evolution &amp; Medicine Review |date=2010-10-13| accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The original formulation of the hygiene hypothesis dates from 1989 when David Strachan proposed that lower incidence of [[infection]] in early childhood could be an explanation for the rapid 20th century rise in allergic diseases such as [[asthma]] and [[hay fever]].&lt;ref name=strachan2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Strachan | first1 = D. | title = Family size, infection and atopy: The first decade of the 'hygiene hypothesis' | doi = 10.1136/thorax.55.suppl_1.S2 | journal = Thorax | volume = 55 | issue = 90001 | pages = S2–S10 | year = 2000 | pmid =  | pmc = 1765943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now also recognised that the "reduced microbial exposure" concept applies to a much broader range of [[chronic inflammatory disease]]s than asthma and hay fever, which includes diseases such as [[type 1 diabetes]]&lt;ref name=stene2001&gt;Stene LC, Nafstad P.

In 2003 Graham Rook proposed the "old friends hypothesis" which some claim offers a more rational explanation for the link between microbial exposure and inflammatory disorders.&lt;ref name=rook2003&gt;Rook GA, Martinelli R, Brunet LR. Innate immune responses to mycobacteria and the downregulation of atopic responses" ''Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol'' 2003 Oct;3(5) 337-42.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the vital microbial exposures are not colds, influenza, measles and other common childhood infections which have evolved relatively recently over the last 10,000 years, but rather the microbes already present during mammalian and human evolution, that could persist in small hunter gatherer groups as microbiota, tolerated latent infections or carrier states. He proposes that humans have become so dependent on these "old friends" that their immune systems neither develop properly nor function properly without them.

Strachan's original formulation of the hygiene hypothesis also centred around the idea that smaller families provided insufficient microbial exposure partly because of less person-to-person spread of infections, but also because of "improved household amenities and higher standards of personal cleanliness".&lt;ref name=strachan2000 /&gt; It seems likely that this was the reason he named it the "hygiene hypothesis". Although the "hygiene revolution" of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries may have been a major factor, it now seems more likely that, although public health measures such as [[sanitation]], [[potable water]] and [[garbage collection]] were instrumental in reducing our exposure to [[cholera]], [[typhoid]] and so on, they also deprived people of their exposure to the "old friends" that occupy the same environmental habitats.&lt;ref name=stanwellsmith&gt;{{cite web |authors=Stanwell-Smith R, Bloomfield SF, Rook GA. |title=The hygiene hypothesis and its implications for home hygiene, lifestyle and public health. |publisher=International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene. |url=http://www.ifh-homehygiene.org/best-practice-review/hygiene-hypothesis-and-its-implications-home-hygiene-lifestyle-and-public-0 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomfield &gt;Bloomfield SF, Stanwell-Smith R, Rook GA.

== History ==

=== Hygiene ===

Although the idea that exposure to certain infections may decrease the risk of allergy is not new, Strachan was one of the first to formally propose it, in an article published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.299.6710.1259 |title=Hay fever, hygiene, and household size |year=1989 |last1=Strachan |first1=D. P. |journal=BMJ |volume=299 |issue=6710 |pages=1259–60 |pmid=2513902 |pmc=1838109}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article proposed to explain the observation that [[hay fever]] and [[eczema]], both allergic diseases, were less common in children from larger families, which were presumably exposed to more infectious agents through their siblings, than in children from families with only one child.

The hypothesis was extensively investigated by [[immunology|immunologists]] and [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] and has become an important theoretical framework for the study of chronic inflammatory disorders. It explains the increase in allergic diseases that has been seen since industrialization and the higher incidence of allergic diseases in more developed countries. Epidemiological studies continue to confirm the protective effect of large family size and of growing up on a farm. However, exposure to common childhood infections such as chickenpox or measles is not thought to be protective.

=== Old friends ===

The "old friends hypothesis" proposed in 2003&lt;ref name=rook2003/&gt; may offer a better explanation for the link between microbial exposure and inflammatory diseases.&lt;ref name=rook2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=rook2003/&gt; This hypothesis argues that the vital exposures are not common childhood and other recently evolved infections, which are no older than 10,000 years, but rather microbes already present in hunter-gatherer times when the human immune system was evolving. Conventional childhood infections are mostly "[[crowd infections]]" that kill or immunise and thus cannot persist in isolated hunter-gatherer groups. Crowd infections started to appear after the [[neolithic agriculture|neolithic agricultural]] revolution, when human populations increased in size and proximity. The microbes that co-evolved with mammalian immune systems are much more ancient. According to this hypothesis, humans became so dependent on them that their immune systems can neither develop nor function properly without them.

Rook proposed that these microbes most likely include:

* Ambient species that exist in the same environments as humans
* Species that inhabit human skin, gut and respiratory tract, and that of the animals we live with
* Organisms such as [[virus]]es and [[helminth]]s (worms) that establish chronic infections or carrier states that humans can tolerate and so could co-evolve a specific immunoregulatory relationship with the immune system.

The modified hypothesis later expanded to include exposure to [[symbiotic]] bacteria and parasites.&lt;ref name=grammatikos2008&gt;{{cite journal | author = Grammatikos Alexandros P | year = 2008 | title = The genetic and environmental basis of atopic diseases | url = | journal = Annals of Medicine | volume = 40 | issue = 7| pages = 482–95 | doi = 10.1080/07853890802082096 | pmid = 18608118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Evolution turns the inevitable into a necessity." This means that the majority of mammalian evolution took place in mud and rotting vegetation and more than 90 percent of human evolution took place in isolated hunter-gatherer communities and farming communities. Therefore, the human immune systems have evolved to anticipate certain types of microbial input, making the inevitable exposure into a necessity. The organisms that are implicated in the hygiene hypothesis are not proven to cause the disease prevalence, however there are sufficient data on lactobacilli, saprophytic environment mycobacteria, and helminths and their association. These bacteria and parasites have commonly been found in vegetation, mud, and water throughout evolution.&lt;ref name=rook2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=rook2003/&gt;

Multiple possible mechanisms have been proposed for how the 'Old Friends' microorganisms prevent autoimmune diseases and asthma.  They include: 
# Reciprocal inhibition between immune responses directed against distinct antigens of the Old Friends microbes which elicit stronger immune responses than the weaker autoantigens and allergens of autoimmune disease and allergy respectively.
# Competition for cytokines, MHC receptors and growth factors needed by the immune system to mount an immune response.
# Immunoregulatory interactions with host TLRs.&lt;ref name=Okada2010/&gt;

=== Microbial diversity ===

The "microbial diversity" hypothesis, proposed by Paolo Matricardi&lt;ref name=matricardi2010&gt;{{cite journal | author = Matricardi PM | year = 2010 | title = 99th Dahlem conference on infection, inflammation and chronic inflammatory disorders: controversial aspects of the 'hygiene hypothesis' | url = | journal = Clin Exp Immunol | volume = 160 | issue = 1| pages = 98–105 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2249.2010.04130.x| pmid = 20415858 | pmc = 2841842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and developed by von Hertzen,&lt;ref name=vonhertzen2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=von Hertzen L, Hanski I, Haahtela T | year = 2011 | title = Natural immunity. Biodiversity loss and inflammatory diseases are two global megatrends that might be related | doi = 10.1038/embor.2011.195 | journal = EMBO Rep | volume = 12 | issue = 11| pages = 1089–1093 | pmc = 3207110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; holds that diversity and turnover of bacterial species in the [[gut mucosa]] and other sites is a key factor for priming and regulating the immune system, rather than stable colonization with a particular species. It is not clear whether diversity per se, or that a diverse population will include certain organisms without which the immune system fails to develop. Rook likened the embryonic immune system to a computer that contains programmes but little data. During gestation and infancy exposure to diverse organisms builds a "database" that allows the immune system to identify and respond to harmful agents and normalize once the danger is eliminated.

For allergic disease, the most important times for exposure are: early in development; later during pregnancy; and the first few days or months of infancy. Exposure needs to be maintained over a significant period. This fits with evidence that delivery by [[Caesarean section]] may be associated with increased allergies, whilst breastfeeding can be protective.&lt;ref name=stanwellsmith /&gt; The extent to which exposures need to be maintained after infancy and whether these conditions could be managed by on-going exposure is as yet unknown.

== Evolution of the adaptive immune system ==

Humans and the microbes they harbor have co-evolved for thousands of centuries; however, it is thought that the human species has gone through numerous phases in history characterized by different pathogen exposures.  For instance, in very early human societies, small interaction between its members has given particular selection to a relatively limited group of pathogens that had high transmission rates.  When societies became larger, the introduction of agriculture some 10,000 years ago made the spreading of new pathogens more likely, and thus exposures to pathogens that favored high population densities to thrive.  Furthermore, pastoralism has made zoonotic pathogen transmissions even more favorable.  It is considered that the human immune system is likely subjected to a selective pressure from pathogens that are responsible for down regulating certain alleles and therefore phenotypes in humans, the thalassemia genes that are shaped by the ''Plasmodium'' species expressing the selection pressure being a model for this theory.

Recent comparative genomic studies have shown that immune response genes (protein coding and non-coding regulatory genes) have less evolutionary constraint, and are rather more frequently targeted by positive selection from pathogens that coevolve with the human subject.  Of all the various types of pathogens known to cause disease in humans, helminths warrant special attention, because of their ability to modify the prevalence or severity of certain immune-related responses in human and mouse models.  In fact recent research has shown that parasitic worms have served as a stronger selective pressure on select human genes encoding interleukins and interleukin receptors when compared to viral and bacterial pathogens.  Helminths are thought to have been as old as the [[adaptive immune system]], suggesting that they may have co-evolved, also implying that our immune system has been strongly focused on fighting off helminthic infections, insofar as to potentially interact with them early in infancy.  The host-pathogen interaction is a very important relationship that serves to shape the immune system development early on in life.&lt;ref&gt;Sironi, Manuela, and Mario Clerici.

== Biological basis ==

Allergic conditions are caused by inappropriate immunological responses to harmless [[antigens]] driven by a [[t helper cell|T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2]]-mediated immune response, T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cells produce [[interleukin 4]], [[interleukin 5]], [[interleukin 6]], [[interleukin 13]] and predominantly [[immunoglobulin E]].&lt;ref name=Okada2010/&gt; Many [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es elicit a [[t helper cell|T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1]]-mediated immune response, which down-regulates T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 responses. T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 immune responses are characterized by the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as [[interleukin 2]], [[IFNγ]], and [[TNFα]]. Factors that favor a predominantly T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 phenotype include: older siblings, large family size, early day care attendance, infection (TB, measles, or hepatitis), rural living, or contact with animals. A T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2-dominated phenotype is associated with high antibiotic use, western lifestyle, urban environment, diet, and sensitivity to dust mites and cockroaches. T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 and T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 responses are reciprocally inhibitory, so when one is active, the other is suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kramer| year = 2013 | title = Maintaining Health by Balancing Microbial Exposure and Prevention of Infection: the Hygiene Hypothesis versus the Hypothesis of Early Immune Challenge | url = | journal = Journal of Hospital Infection | volume = 83 | issue = | page = 51 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism of action of the hygiene hypothesis was insufficient stimulation of the T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 arm, stimulating the cell defence of the immune system and leading to an overactive mother T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 arm, stimulating the antibody-mediated immunity of the immune systems, which in turn led to allergic disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0167-5699(00)01582-6 |title=Do common childhood infections 'teach' the immune system not to be allergic? |year=2000 |last1=Folkerts |first1=Gert |last2=Walzl |first2=Gerhard |last3=Openshaw |first3=Peter J.M. |journal=Immunology Today |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=118–20 |pmid=10777250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This explanation however, cannot explain the rise in incidence (similar to the rise of allergic diseases) of several T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1-mediated [[autoimmunity|autoimmune diseases]], including [[inflammatory bowel disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type I diabetes]]. [Figure 1Bach] However, the North South Gradient seen in the prevalence of multiple sclerosis has been found to be inversely related to the global distribution of parasitic infection.[Figure 2Bach] Additionally, research has shown that MS patients infected with parasites displayed T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 type immune responses as opposed to the proinflammatory T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 immune phenotype seen in non-infected multiple sclerosis patients.[Fleming] Parasite infection has also been shown to improve inflammatory bowel disease and may act in a similar fashion as it does in multiple sclerosis.[Lee]

An alternative explanation is that the developing immune system must receive stimuli (from infectious agents, symbiotic bacteria, or parasites) to adequately develop [[regulatory T cell]]s. Without that stimuli it becomes more susceptible to autoimmune diseases and allergic diseases, because of insufficiently repressed T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 and T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 responses, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.iac.2005.03.005 |title=The Hygiene Hypothesis Revisited |year=2005 |last1=Bufford |first1=Jeremy D. |last2=Gern |first2=James E. |journal=Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=247–62, v–vi |pmid=15878454 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, all chronic inflammatory disorders show evidence of failed immunoregulation.&lt;ref name=rockgaw&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rook GAW | date = Apr 2010 | title = 99th Dahlem conference on infection, inflammation and chronic inflammatory disorders: darwinian medicine and the 'hygiene' or 'old friends' hypothesis | url = | journal = Clin Exp Immunol | volume = 160 | issue = 1| pages = 70–9 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2249.2010.04133.x| pmid = 20415854 | pmc = 2841838 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, helminths, non-pathogenic ambient pseudocommensal bacteria or certain gut [[commensal]]s and [[probiotics]], drive immunoregulation.

== Epidemiological evidence ==
{{medref|section|date=May 2016}}

The hygiene hypothesis is supported by epidemiological data. Studies have shown that various immunological and autoimmune diseases are much less common in the developing world than the industrialized world and that immigrants to the industrialized world from the developing world increasingly develop immunological disorders in relation to the length of time since arrival in the industrialized world.&lt;ref name=Okada2010/&gt; This is true for asthma&lt;ref name="pmid12910582"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ppul.10323 |title=Migration to a western country increases asthma symptoms but not eosinophilic airway inflammation |year=2003 |last1=Gibson |first1=Peter G. |last2=Henry |first2=Richard L. |last3=Shah |first3=Smita |last4=Powell |first4=Heather |last5=Wang |first5=He |journal=Pediatric Pulmonology |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=209–15 |pmid=12910582}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other chronic inflammatory disorders.&lt;ref name=rook2013 /&gt;

Antibiotic usage, which reduces the diversity of gut microbiota, is another cited factor. Although several studies have shown associations between antibiotic use and later development of asthma or allergy, other studies suggest that the effect is due to more frequent antibiotic use in asthmatic children. Trends in vaccine use may also be relevant, but epidemiological studies provide no consistent support for a detrimental effect of vaccination/immunization on [[atopy]] rates.&lt;ref name=stanwellsmith /&gt; In support of the old friends hypothesis, the intestinal microbiome was found to differ between allergic and non-allergic Estonian and Swedish children (although this finding was not replicated in a larger cohort), and the biodiversity of the intestinal flora in patients with Crohn’s disease was diminished.&lt;ref name=Okada2010/&gt;

In 2015, a study found that washing dishes by hand as opposed to using a dishwasher, along with eating food directly from a farm or fermented food, might lead to reduced risk of certain conditions, including asthma, eczema, and possibly hay fever, though the data found on hay fever was not regarded as [[Statistical significant|statistically significant]].

== Public health trends ==

Since allergies and other chronic inflammatory diseases are largely diseases of the last 100 years or so, the "hygiene" revolution of the last 200 years came under scrutiny as a possible cause. During the 1800s radical improvements to sanitation and water quality occurred in Europe and North America. The introduction of toilets and sewer systems and the cleanup of city streets, and cleaner food were part of this program. This in turn led to a rapid decline in infectious diseases, particularly during the period 1900-1950, through reduced exposure to infectious agents.&lt;ref name=stanwellsmith /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomfield /&gt;

Public health activities have also played a part in affecting diet and lifestyle, such as physical activity levels and locations.

It has been suggested that public awareness of the initial form of the "hygiene hypothesis" has led to an "increased disregard" for hygiene in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956713513003745 | doi=10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.07.026 | volume=35 | title=Hygiene in the home kitchen: Changes in behaviour and impact of key microbiological hazard control measures | journal=Food Control | pages=392–400| year=2014 | last1=Taché | first1=J. | last2=Carpentier | first2=B. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==

While no hygiene-related treatments are part of the standard of care, various approaches are under investigation. Helminth therapy is one alternative.&lt;ref name= fleming2011/&gt; [[Probiotic]]s (drinks or foods) have never been shown to reintroduce microbes to the gut. As yet, therapeutically relevant microbes have not been specifically identified.&lt;ref name=sanders2013&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sanders ME, Guarner F, Guerrant R, Holt PR, Quigley EM, Sartor RB, Sherman PM, Mayer EA | date = May 2013 | title = An update on the use and investigation of probiotics in health and disease | url = | journal = Gut | volume = 62 | issue = 5| pages = 787–96 | doi=10.1136/gutjnl-2012-302504| pmid = 23474420 | pmc = 4351195 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifestyle changes could increase microbial exposure, but whether this on balance improves the balance of risks remains the subject of research. Proposals include natural childbirth, sustained breast feeding and physical interaction between siblings, and encouraging children to spend more time in "uncleaned" outdoor environments.

Should these therapies become accepted, public policy implications include providing green spaces in urban areas or even providing access to agricultural environments for children.&lt;ref name="gaw in press"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rook GA | date = Oct 2013 | title = Regulation of the immune system by biodiversity from the natural environment: an ecosystem service essential to health | url = | journal = PNAS | volume =  110| issue = 46| pages =  18360–18367| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1313731110 | bibcode = 2013PNAS..11018360R| pmc = 3831972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Helminthic therapy ===
{{Main article|Helminthic therapy}}
{{See also|Effects of parasitic worms on the immune system}}

Helminthic therapy is the treatment of [[autoimmune disease]]s and [[immune disorder]]s by means of deliberate infestation with a [[helminth]] [[larva]] or [[Ovum|ova]].

The anti-inflammatory effects of helminth infection are prompting interest and research into diseases that involve inflammation but that are not currently considered to include autoimmunity or immune dysregulation as a causative factor. Heart disease and arteriosclerosis both have similar epidemiological profiles as autoimmune diseases and both involve inflammation. Their increased incidence cannot be solely attributed to environmental factors. Recent research explored the eradication of helminths as contributing to this discrepancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2004.09.028 |title=Can worms defend our hearts?

== Cleanliness ==
No evidence supports the idea that reducing modern practices of cleanliness and hygiene would have any impact on rates of chronic inflammatory and allergic disorders, but a significant amount of evidence that it would increase the risks of infectious diseases.&lt;ref name=stanwellsmith/&gt;

If home and personal cleanliness contributes to reduced exposure to vital microbes, its role is likely to be small. The idea that homes can be made “sterile” through excessive cleanliness is implausible. The evidence shows that, as fast as they are removed by cleaning, microbes are replaced, via dust and air from outdoors, by shedding from the body and other living things as well as from food.&lt;ref name=stanwellsmith/&gt;&lt;ref name= Bloomfield /&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomfield2012&gt;Bloomfield SF. Exner M, Signorelli C, Nath KJ, Scott EA. 2012.

International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene. http://www.ifh-homehygiene.org/best-practice-review/hygiene-procedures-home-and-their-effectiveness-review-scientific-evidence-base&lt;/ref&gt; The key point may be that the microbial content of urban housing has altered, not because of home and personal hygiene habits, but because they are part of urban environments. Diet and lifestyle changes also affects the gut, skin and respiratory microbiota.

At the same time that concerns about allergies and other chronic inflammatory diseases have been increasing, so also have concerns about infectious disease.&lt;ref name=stanwellsmith /&gt;&lt;ref name= Bloomfield /&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomfield2009&gt;Bloomfield SF, Exner M, Fara GM, Nath KJ, Scott, EA; Van der Voorden C.

Edited by William A. Rutala and David J. Weber&lt;/ref&gt; Infectious diseases continue to exert a heavy health toll. Preventing [[pandemics]] and reducing [[antibiotic resistance]] are global priorities. Hygiene is a cornerstone of containing these threats.

=== Infection risk management ===

The International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene has developed a risk management approach to reducing home infection risks. This approach uses microbiological and epidemiological evidence to identify the key routes of infection transmission in the home. These data indicate that the critical routes involve the hands, hand and food contact surfaces and cleaning utensils. Clothing and household linens involve somewhat lower risks. Surfaces that contact the body, such as baths and hand basins, can act as infection vehicles, as can surfaces associated with toilets. Airborne transmission can be important for some pathogens. A key aspect of this approach is that it maximises protection against pathogens and infection, but is more relaxed about visible cleanliness in order to sustain normal exposure to other human, animal and environmental microbes.&lt;ref name= bloomfield2012/&gt;

== Alternative hypotheses ==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2016}}

There are other hypotheses that try to explain the increase in [[Allergy|allergies]] in developed nations. Major areas of focus include infant feeding, over-exposure and exposure to certain pollutants.

Infant feeding topics includes breastfeeding, when babies begin to eat solid foods and the type of these foods, cow's milk vs other milks and variations in milk processing.

Over-exposure to allergens in occupational situations can cause allergic responses, such as [[Laboratory animal allergy]], [[Bird fancier's lung|bird lung]], [[farmer's lung]] and bakers lung (See [[Wheat allergy]]).

The [[pool chlorine hypothesis]] was proposed by Albert Bernard and his colleagues as an alternative hypothesis based on [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] evidence in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/oem.60.6.385 |title=Lung hyperpermeability and asthma prevalence in schoolchildren: Unexpected associations with the attendance at indoor chlorinated swimming pools |year=2003 |last1=Bernard |first1=A |journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine |volume=60 |issue=6 |pages=385–94 |pmid=12771389 |last2=Carbonnelle |first2=S |last3=Michel |first3=O |last4=Higuet |first4=S |last5=De Burbure |first5=C |last6=Buchet |first6=JP |last7=Hermans |first7=C |last8=Dumont |first8=X |last9=Doyle |first9=I |displayauthors=3|pmc=1740550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IDEF''', initially abbreviation of '''[[Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing|ICAM]] Definition''', renamed in 1999 as '''Integration DEFinition''',&lt;ref name="IEEE IDEF Ref"&gt;IEEE Standard for Functional Modeling Language—Syntax and Semantics for IDEF0, Software Engineering Standards Committee of the IEEE Computer Society, IEEE-SA Standards Board, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. 345 East 47th Street, New York, NY 10017-2394, USA, [http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/1320.1-1998.html IEEE Std 1320.1-1998], 25 June 1998&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a family of [[modeling language]]s in the field of [[systems engineering|systems]] and [[software engineering]]. They cover a wide range of uses, from functional modeling to data, simulation, object-oriented analysis/design and knowledge acquisition. These "definition languages" were developed under funding from [[U.S. Air Force]] and although still most commonly used by them, as well as other military and [[United States Department of Defense|United States Department of Defense (DoD)]] agencies, are in the [[public domain]].

The most-widely recognized and used components of the IDEF family are [[IDEF0]], a [[functional model]]ing language building on [[Structured Analysis and Design Technique|SADT]], and [[IDEF1X]], which addresses [[Data model|information models]] and [[database design]] issues.

== Overview of IDEF methods ==
IDEF refers to a family of [[modeling language]], which cover a wide range of uses, from functional modeling to data, simulation, object-oriented analysis/design and knowledge acquisition. Eventually the IDEF methods have been defined up to IDEF14:  
* [[IDEF0]] : Function modeling&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idef.com/IDEF0.htm IDEFØ Overview] at idef.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[IDEF1X#History|IDEF1]] : Information modeling &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idef.com/IDEF1.htm IDEF1 Overview] at idef.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[IDEF1X]] : Data modeling &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idef.com/IDEF1x.htm IDEF1x Overview] at idef.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[IDEF2]] : Simulation model design
* [[IDEF3]] : Process description capture &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idef.com/IDEF3.htm IDEF3 Overview] at idef.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[IDEF4]] : Object-oriented design &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idef.com/IDEF4.htm IDEF4 Overview] at idef.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[IDEF5]] : Ontology description capture &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idef.com/IDEF5.htm IDEF5 Overview] at idef.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[IDEF6]] : Design rationale capture &lt;ref name= "MGM90"/&gt;
* IDEF7 : Information system auditing
* [[IDEF8]] : User interface modeling
* [[IDEF9]] : Business constraint discovery
* IDEF10 : Implementation architecture modeling
* IDEF11 : Information artifact modeling
* IDEF12 : Organization modeling
* IDEF13 : Three schema mapping design
* [[IDEF14]] : Network design

In 1995 only the [[IDEF0]], [[IDEF1X]], [[IDEF2]], [[IDEF3]] and [[IDEF4]] had been developed in full.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Hanrahan [http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/crosstalk/1995/06/IDEF.asp The IDEF Process Modeling Methodology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126094915/http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/crosstalk/1995/06/IDEF.asp |date=2007-01-26 }}. Software Technology Support Center. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the other IDEF concepts had some preliminary design. Some of the last efforts were new IDEF developments in 1995 toward establishing reliable methods for business constraint discovery [[IDEF9]], design rationale capture [[IDEF6]], human system, interaction design [[IDEF8]], and network design [[IDEF14]].&lt;ref name="May05"/&gt; 

The methods IDEF7, IDEF10, IDEF11, IDEF 12 and IDEF13 haven't been developed any further than their initial definition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/enterprise-solutions/idef-standards-overview-18730 Observations from a Tech Architect: Enterprise Implementation Issues &amp; Solutions] Craig Borysowich. Accessed 20 Jan 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
IDEF originally stood for ''[[Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing|ICAM]] Definition'', initiated in the 1970s at the US Air Force Materials Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio by [[Dennis E. Wisnosky]], Dan L. Shunk and others.&lt;ref name="Sav96"&gt;Charles M. Savage (1996). ''Fifth Generation Management : Co-creating Through Virtual Enterprising, Dynamic Teaming, and Knowledge Networking'' Butterworth-Heinemann, 1996. {{ISBN|0-7506-9701-6}}. p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; and completed in the 1980s. IDEF was a product of the [[Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing]] (ICAM) initiative of the [[United States Air Force]]. The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] recast the IDEF abbreviation as "Integration DEFinition."&lt;ref name="IEEE IDEF Ref"/&gt;

The specific projects that produced IDEF were ICAM project priorities 111 and 112 (later renumbered 1102). The subsequent Integrated Information Support System (IISS) project priorities 6201, 6202, and 6203 attempted to create an [[information processing]] environment that could be run in [[heterogeneous]] physical computing environments. Further development of IDEF occurred under those projects as a result of the experience gained from applications of the new modeling techniques. The intent of the IISS efforts was to create 'generic subsystems' that could be used by a large number of collaborating enterprises, such as U.S. [[defense contractor]]s and the armed forces of friendly nations.

At the time of the ICAM 1102 effort there were numerous, mostly incompatible, [[data model]] methods for storing computer data &amp;mdash; [[Sequential access|sequential]] ([[VSAM]]), [[Hierarchical model|hierarchical]] ([[Information Management System|IMS]]), [[Network model|network]] ([[Cincom]]'s TOTAL and [[CODASYL]], and [[Cullinet]]'s [[IDMS]]). The [[relational data model]] was just emerging as a promising way of thinking about structuring data for easy, efficient, and accurate access. [[Relational database management system|Relational database management systems]] had not yet emerged as a general standard for data management.

The ICAM program office deemed it valuable to create a "neutral" way of describing the data content of large-scale systems. The emerging academic literature suggested that methods were needed to process [[Data independence|data independently]] of the way it was [[data structure|physically stored]]. Thus the IDEF1 language was created to allow a neutral description of data structures that could be applied regardless of the storage method or file access method.

IDEF1 was developed under ICAM program priority 1102 by Dr Robert R. Brown of the [[Hughes Aircraft Company]], under contract to [[SofTech, Inc.]] Dr Brown had previously been responsible for the development of [[Information Management System|IMS]] while working at [[Rockwell International]]. Rockwell chose not to pursue IMS as a marketable product but [[International Business Machines|IBM]], which had served as a support contractor during development, subsequently took over the product and was successful in further developing it for market. Dr Brown credits his Hughes' colleague Mr Timothy Ramey as the inventor of IDEF1 as a viable formalism for modeling information structures. The two Hughes' researchers built on ideas from and interactions with many luminaries in the field at the time. In particular, IDEF1 draws on the following techniques:
* the evolving natural language information model ([[NIAM|ENALIM]]) technique of [[G. M. Nijssen|Dr G. M. Nijssen]] ([[Control Data Corporation]]) — this technique is now more widely known as [[NIAM]] or the object-role model [[Object-role modeling|ORM]];
* the network data structures technique, popularly called the [[CODASYL]] approach, of [[Charles Bachman|Dr Charles Bachman]] ([[Honeywell Information Systems]]);
* the hierarchical data management technique, implemented in IBM's IMS data management system, developed by [[R. R. Brown|Dr R. R. Brown]] ([[Rockwell International]]);
* the relational approach to data of [[E. F. Codd|Dr E. F. Codd]] ([[IBM]]);
* The [[entity-relationship model|entity-relationship approach]] (E-R) of [[Peter Chen|Dr Peter Chen]] ([[UCLA]]).
The effort to develop IDEF1 resulted in both a new method for information modeling and an example of its use in the form of a "reference information model of manufacturing." This latter artifact was developed by D. S. Coleman of the D. Appleton Company (DACOM) acting as a sub-contractor to Hughes and under the direction of Mr Ramey. Personnel at DACOM became quite expert at IDEF1 modeling and subsequently produced a training course and accompanying materials for the IDEF1 modeling technique.

Experience with IDEF1 revealed that the translation of ''information requirements'' into ''database designs'' was more difficult than had originally been anticipated. The most beneficial value of the IDEF1 information modeling technique was its ability to represent data independent of how those data were to be stored and used. It provided data modelers and data analysts with a way to represent ''data requirements'' during the requirements-gathering process. This allowed designers to decide which DBMS to use after the nature of the data requirements was understood and thus reduced the "misfit" between data requirements and the capabilities and limitations of the DBMS. The translation of IDEF1 models to database designs, however, proved to be difficult.

== The IDEF modeling languages ==

=== IDEF0 ===
{{main|IDEF0}}
[[Image:IDEF Diagram Example.jpg|280px|thumb|Example of an [[IDEF0]] diagram: a [[function model]] of the process of maintaining reparable spares]]

The IDEF0 functional modeling method is designed to model the decisions, actions, and activities of an organization or system.&lt;ref name = "VG00"&gt;Varun Grover, William J. Kettinger (2000). ''Process Think: Winning Perspectives for Business Change in the Information Age. p.168.&lt;/ref&gt; It was derived from the established graphic modeling language [[Structured Analysis and Design Technique|structured analysis and design technique]] (SADT) developed by [[Douglas T. Ross]] and [[SofTech, Inc.]]. In its original form, IDEF0 includes both a definition of a graphical modeling language ([[syntax]] and [[semantics]]) and a description of a comprehensive methodology for developing models.&lt;ref name= "ITL93"&gt;[http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/idef02.doc FIPS Publication 183] released of IDEFØ December 1993 by the Computer Systems Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).&lt;/ref&gt; The US Air Force commissioned the SADT developers to develop a [[function model]] method for analyzing and communicating the functional perspective of a system. IDEF0 should assist in organizing system analysis and promote effective communication between the analyst and the customer through simplified graphical devices.&lt;ref name = "VG00"/&gt;

=== IDEF1X ===
{{main|IDEF1X}}
[[Image:B 5 1 IDEF1X Diagram.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Example of an [[IDEF1X]] diagram]]

To satisfy the [[data modeling]] enhancement requirements that were identified in the IISS-6202 project, a sub-contractor, [[DACOM]], obtained a license to the [[logical database design technique]] (LDDT) and its supporting software (ADAM). LDDT had been developed in 1982 by Robert G. Brown of The Database Design Group entirely outside the IDEF program and with no knowledge of IDEF1. LDDT combined elements of the relational data model, the E-R model, and generalization in a way specifically intended to support data modeling and the transformation of the data models into database designs. The graphic syntax of LDDT differed from that of IDEF1 and, more importantly, LDDT contained interrelated modeling concepts not present in IDEF1. Mary E. Loomis wrote a concise summary of the syntax and semantics of a substantial subset of LDDT, using terminology compatible with IDEF1 wherever possible. DACOM labeled the result [[IDEF1X]] and supplied it to the ICAM program.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE (1998). ''IEEE Std 1320.2-1998. IEEE Standard for Conceptual Modeling Language Syntax and Semantics for IDEF1X''. New York. p. iii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, Thomas A. (1992), Designing Quality Databases with IDEF1X Information Models, {{ISBN|0-932633-18-8}} p=xii&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because the IDEF program was funded by the government, the techniques are in the [[public domain]]. In addition to the ADAM software, sold by DACOM under the name Leverage, a number of [[Computer-aided software engineering|CASE]] tools use [[IDEF1X]] as their representation technique for data modeling. 

The IISS projects actually produced working prototypes of an information processing environment that would run in heterogeneous computing environments. Current advancements in such techniques as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[JDBC]] are now achieving the goals of ubiquity and versatility across computing environments which was first demonstrated by IISS.

=== IDEF2 and IDEF3 ===
{{main|IDEF3}}
[[File:2-03 Example of an Enhanced Transition Schematic.jpg|thumb|240px|Example of an enhanced transition schematic, modelled with [[IDEF3]]]]

The third IDEF (IDEF2) was originally intended as a user interface modeling method. However, since the [[Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing]] (ICAM) program needed a simulation modeling tool, the resulting IDEF2 was a method for representing the time varying behavior of resources in a manufacturing system, providing a framework for specification of math model based simulations. It was the intent of the methodology program within [[Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing|ICAM]] to rectify this situation but limitation of funding did not allow this to happen. As a result, the lack of a method which would support the structuring of descriptions of the [[user view]] of a system has been a major shortcoming of the IDEF system. The basic problem from a methodology point of view is the need to distinguish between a description of what a system (existing or proposed) is supposed to do and a representative simulation model that will predict what a system will do. The latter was the focus of [[IDEF2]], the former is the focus of [[IDEF3]].&lt;ref name="FB89"&gt;Patricia Griffith Friel and Thomas M. Blinn (1989). [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19910023489_1991023489.pdf "Automated IDEF3 and IDEF4 Systems Design Specification Document"]. Technical report. NASA Johnson Space Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IDEF4 ===
{{main|IDEF4}}
[[File:118 The Behavior Diagram for methods Implementing Louder.jpg|thumb|left|210px|[[IDEF4]] behavior diagram]]

The development of [[IDEF4]] came from the recognition that the modularity, maintainability and code reusability that results from the [[object-oriented programming]] paradigm can be realized in traditional [[data processing]] applications. The proven ability of the object-oriented programming paradigm to support data level integration in large complex [[distributed system]]s is also a major factor in the widespread interest in this technology from the traditional data processing community.&lt;ref name="FB89"/&gt;

[[IDEF4]] was developed as a design tool for software designers who use object-oriented languages such as the [[Common Lisp Object System]], [[Flavors (programming language)|Flavors]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Objective-C]], [[C++]], and others. Since effective usage of the object-oriented paradigm requires a different thought process than used with conventional procedural or [[database language]]s, standard methodologies such as [[structure chart]]s, [[data flow diagram]]s, and traditional [[database model|data design model]]s (hierarchical, relational, and network) are not sufficient. IDEF4 seeks to provide the necessary facilities to support the object-oriented design decision making process.&lt;ref name="FB89"/&gt;

=== IDEF5 ===
{{main|IDEF5}}
[[Image:4-54 Composition Schematic for Ballpoint.jpg|thumb|240px|Example of an [[IDEF5]] composition schematic for a ballpoint pen]]

[[IDEF5]], or ''integrated definition for ontology description capture method'', is a software engineering method to develop and maintain usable, accurate, domain [[ontology (computer science)|ontologies]].&lt;ref name="PCB94"&gt;Perakath C. Benjamin et al. (1994). [http://www.idef.com/pdf/Idef5.pdf ''IDEF5 Method Report'']. Knowledge Based Systems, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of computer science ontologies are used to capture the [[concept and object]]s in a specific [[Domain analysis|domain]], along with associated relationships and meanings. In addition, ontology capture helps coordinate projects by standardizing [[terminology]] and creates opportunities for [[information]] reuse. The IDEF5 Ontology Capture Method has been developed to reliably construct ontologies in a way that closely reflects human [[understanding]] of the specific domain.&lt;ref name="PCB94"/&gt;

In the IDEF5 method, an ontology is constructed by capturing the content of certain assertions about real-world objects, their properties and their interrelationships, and representing that content in an intuitive and natural form. The IDEF5 method has three main components: A graphical language to support conceptual ontology analysis, a structured text language for detailed ontology characterization, and a systematic procedure that provides guidelines for effective ontology capture.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Varun Grover, William J. Kettinger (2000). ''Process Think: Winning Perspectives for Business Change in the Information Age. p.176-178&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IDEF6 ===
{{main|IDEF6}}
[[File:IIDEF4 Design Activities.jpg|thumb|210px|left|IDEF6 model of IDEF4 design activities]]

[[IDEF6]], or ''integrated definition for design rationale capture'', is a method to facilitate the acquisition, representation, and manipulation of the [[design rationale]] used in the development of [[enterprise systems]]. Rationale is the reason, justification, underlying motivation, or excuse that moved the designer to select a particular strategy or design feature. More simply, rationale is interpreted as the answer to the question, “Why is this design being done in this manner?” Most design methods focus on what the design is (i.e. on the final product, rather than why the design is the way it is).&lt;ref name="May05"/&gt; 

IDEF6 will be a method that possesses the conceptual resources and linguistic capabilities needed
# to represent the nature and structure of the information that constitutes design rationale within a given system, and
# to associate that rationale with design specifications, models, and documentation for the system.
IDEF6 is applicable to all phases of the information system development process, from initial conceptualization through both preliminary and detailed design activities. To the extent that detailed design decisions for software systems are relegated to the coding phase, the IDEF6 technique should be usable during the software construction process as well.&lt;ref name= "MGM90"&gt;[[Richard J. Mayer|Mayer, Richard J.]] ; Griffith, Patricia A. ; Menzel, Christopher P. (1990-91) [http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA261594 "IDEF6: A Design Rationale Capture Method Concept Paper"] Defense Technical Information Center&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IDEF8 ===
IDEF8, or ''integrated definition for human-system interaction design'', is a method for producing high-quality designs of interactions between users and the systems they operate. Systems are characterized as a collection of objects that perform functions to accomplish a particular goal. The system with which the user interacts can be any system, not necessarily a computer program. Human-system interactions are designed at three levels of specification within the IDEF8 method. The first level defines the philosophy of system operation and produces a set of models and textual descriptions of overall system processes. The second level of design specifies role-centered scenarios of system use. The third level of IDEF8 design is for human-system design detailing. At this level of design, IDEF8 provides a library of metaphors to help users and designers specify the desired behavior in terms of other objects whose behavior is more familiar. Metaphors provide a model of abstract concepts in terms of familiar, concrete objects and experiences.&lt;ref name="May05"/&gt;

=== IDEF9 ===
[[File:Typical business systems.jpg|thumb|320px|Typical business systems]]

IDEF9, or ''integrated definition for business constraint discovery'', is designed to assist in the discovery and analysis of constraints in a [[business system]]. A primary motivation driving the development of IDEF9 was an acknowledgment that the collection of constraints that forge an enterprise system is generally poorly defined. The knowledge of what constraints exist and how those constraints interact is incomplete, disjoint, distributed, and often completely unknown. This situation is not necessarily alarming. Just as living organisms do not need to be aware of the genetic or autonomous constraints that govern certain behaviors, organizations can (and most do) perform well without explicit knowledge of the glue that structures the system. In order to modify business in a predictable manner, however, the knowledge of these constraints is as critical as knowledge of genetics is to the genetic engineer.&lt;ref name="May05"/&gt;

=== IDEF14 ===
IDEF14, or ''integrated definition for network design method'', is a method that targets the modeling and design of [[computer network|computer]] and [[communication network]]s. It can be used to model existing ("as is") or envisioned ("to be") networks. It helps the network designer to investigate potential network designs and to document design rationale. The fundamental goals of the IDEF14 research project developed from a perceived need for good network designs that can be implemented quickly and accurately.&lt;ref name="May05"/&gt;

A '''lantern clock''' is a type of antique weight-driven [[wall]] [[clock]], shaped like a [[lantern]].  They were the first type of clock widely used in private homes.&lt;ref name="Milham"&gt;{{cite book
|last=Milham
|first=Willis I.
|title=Time and Timekeepers
|year=1945
|publisher=MacMillan
|location=New York
|pages=89–94
|isbn=0780800087}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They probably originated before 1500 but only became common after 1600;&lt;ref name="Milham" /&gt; in [[Early Modern Britain|Britain]] around 1620.  They became obsolete in the 19th century.

== Origin of the name ==

There are two theories of the origin of the name "lantern clock". One is that it refers to brass, the main metal of which English lantern clocks are made. Clocks were first made on the continent, at first of iron with iron wheels, and then later with brass wheels. Later still, in France, Belgium and The Netherlands, clocks began to be made from brass.&lt;ref&gt;Robey, J.A., "Iron Crossings and Brass Rims", The Horological Journal, British Horological Institute, Newark, England,July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Brass alloys were then called [[latten]], and it seems likely that brass clocks would have been called "latten clocks" (or "latten horloge" or "latten uhr" in the native languages) to distinguish them from iron clocks, and that "lantern" could be an English interpretation or corruption of latten. The other is that the name derived from the shape; the clock resembles a rectangular lantern of that period, and like a lantern was hung on the wall.

In inventories of deceased clockmakers, lantern clocks are usually referred to as "house clocks", "chamber clocks" or simply "clocks", since in 17th century England they were almost the only type of domestic clocks that existed. It was only after a century had passed, when other types of domestic clocks began to be used in British houses, that more descriptive names for it appeared.  Other names used for lantern clocks are "bedpost", "birdcage" or "Cromwellian" clocks. "Sheep's head clock" was a nickname term for a type of lantern clock that had an extremely large chapter ring covering almost the entire front.

== Origin of lantern clocks ==

The English lantern clock is closely related to lantern clocks that can be found on the European continent. A group of craftsmen from the Low Lands (Flanders) and France, of which some were clockmakers, had established themselves in London at the end of the 16th century. At the same time the middle classes in towns and cities of England began to prosper and the need arose for domestic clocks. Until that time clocks in English houses were confined to the nobility; ordinary people were dependent on sundials, or the tower clocks of local churches.

[[Image:Vallin.jpg|thumb|Clock that was signed 'N. Vallin 1598' Picture of a replica in the Dutch Museum 'Van Speelklok tot Pierement' in Utrecht. The original clock is displayed in the British Museum in London.]]

It is generally accepted that the first lantern clocks in England were made by Frauncoy Nowe and Nicholas Vallin, two Huguenots who had fled from the Low Lands.

== Style characteristics ==

Lantern clocks were made almost entirely of [[brass]], whereas most earlier clocks had been constructed from iron and wood. Typical lantern clocks comprised a [[Square (geometry)|square]] case on ball or [[urn]] feet, a large [[Circle|circular]] dial (with a chapter ring extending beyond the width of the case on early examples), a single hour hand, and a large [[bell (instrument)|bell]] and [[finial]]. The clocks usually had ornate pierced [[fretwork]] on top of the frame.

The main style characteristics of English lantern clocks are similar to its Continental relatives: a wall clock with square bottom and top plates surmounted by a large bell, four corner pillars, a series of vertical plates positioned behind each other and a 30-hour movement with one or more weights.  At the start of the 17th century, the style gradually evolved to a standard to which all clockmakers more or less complied. The guild supervised the clockmakers, who were compelled to work within a prescribed method. Suppliers to the clockmakers' trade contributed to this general style as well. For example, the brass founders supplied stylistically identical clock posts to several clockmakers. In contrast to the Dutch variants, such as stool clocks, English lantern clocks were entirely made of metal (brass and steel).

Lantern clocks were originally weight-driven: usually one weight for time keeping and a second for striking. A few later lantern-style clocks were constructed with spring mechanisms, and many surviving examples of the original weight-driven type have been converted to spring or pendulum mechanisms.

== Guild system ==

In only a few decades the lantern clock became very popular in London, and from there its popularity spread to the entire country. This is evident from the large number of lantern clocks that still exist. Dozens of [[clockmakers]] produced great numbers of these clocks in the city of London during the 17th century. This huge productivity was the result of the high demand for this popular clock in combination with an effective [[guild]] system. In 1631 King Charles I granted a charter for a clockmaker guild in London: the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers]], which exists to this day. Many of the well-known clockmakers from that era were freemen of this guild. Many small companies were established in Lothbury in London that functioned as suppliers for the clockmakers. A clockmaker could benefit from the services of brass founders who supplied cast brass clock parts, dial plates, finials, pillars, frets etc., or employ engravers who would carry out the engraving of the dial plates and frets. The guild assured the quality of the products that left the clockmakers' workshops. Before a clockmaker could become a freeman, able to set up his own shop, he had to spend 7 years as an apprentice learning the trade.  This ensured independent clockmakers a plentiful supply of apprentices, who were also cheap labourers who helped to attain this high productivity.

== Influence of the Renaissance ==

Style characteristics were copied from prints that were available for craftsmen. Under the influence of the Renaissance, prints with motives and patterns from the Classical antiquity found their way to the workshops. They served as examples for the clock pillars that were inspired by columns from Greek temples. During the 17th century the tulip became very popular to an extent of a real tulip mania. Prints with pictures of tulips were a rewarding subject for the adornment of the dial plates of lantern clocks. In the early 17th century, lantern clocks got their characteristic shape, which hardly changed during the 17th and halfway through the next century as a result of all this.

== Clock parts ==

The London Clockmakers equipped their lantern clocks with four pillars inspired by classical columns. Attached to these pillars are classical vase-shaped finials and well-shaped feet. To those finials a bell strap is attached that spreads from four corners and holds a bell. To hide the hammer and the clock movement from the spectator three frets are attached to the finials. The front fret is pierced and engraved whereas the two side frets are pierced but usually left blank. The front of the clock case consists of an engraved dial plate on which a circular dial ring is attached. Almost all lantern clocks originally had just one clock hand to indicate the hours. A standard lantern clock strikes the hours on a large bell and is often equipped with an alarm that rings the same bell. Two doors provide access to the movement and are hinged at the sides of the clock. One or more weights are hanging from ropes or chains at the bottom of the clock.

== Obsolescence ==

Lantern clocks were produced in vast numbers during the decades before the pioneering invention of the pendulum by the Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] in 1656. Before this invention, lantern clocks used a [[balance wheel]] lacking a [[balance spring]] for their timekeeping element, which limited their accuracy to perhaps 15 minutes per day.           Shortly after Huygens' invention, the bob pendulum was introduced in England, and most English clockmakers adopted the new system quickly.  The pendulum increased the accuracy of clocks so greatly that many existing clocks were converted, with pendulums being added at the back.  Measuring time became much more accurate, but most clockmakers kept building lantern clocks without minute hands: this maybe just a matter of tradition. The result was that clockmakers started to develop other types of domestic clocks. Longcase clocks with 8-day movements made lantern clocks obsolete, and gradually lantern clocks disappeared from the London interiors in the first decades of the 18th century. In rural areas lantern clocks were produced until the beginning of the 19th century, and in those years they were also exported to countries like Turkey, and supplied with oriental numbers on their dials. In the Victorian era there was a revival of interest in antique lantern clocks. Unfortunately this also meant that many clocks of renowned makers were stripped of their movements, which were replaced by 'modern' winding movements. Nowadays unmodified original lantern clocks are very rare.

{{about|the philosophical concept|the Italian political concept|Meliorism (politics)}}

'''Meliorism''' is an idea in [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] thinking holding that [[Progress (history)|progress]] is a real concept leading to an improvement of the world.  It holds that humans can, through their interference with processes that would otherwise be natural, produce an outcome which is an improvement over the aforementioned natural one.

Meliorism, as a conception of the person and society, is at the foundation of contemporary [[liberal democracy]] and [[human rights]] and is a basic component of [[liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sprc.unsw.edu.au/media/SPRCFile/dp068.pdf|title=Liberalism, gender and social policy|author=Shaver, S.|date=July 1996|editor=T. Eardly|publisher=Social Policy Research Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important understanding of the meliorist tradition comes from the American Pragmatic tradition.  One can read about it in the works of [[Lester Frank Ward]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]].

Meliorism has also been used by [[Arthur Caplan]] to describe positions in [[bioethics]] that are in favor of ameliorating conditions which cause suffering, even if the conditions have long existed (e.g. being in favor of cures for common diseases, being in favor of serious anti-aging therapies as they are developed).

A closely related concept discussed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Marquis de Condorcet]] is that of [[perfectibility of man]].  

Condorcet's statement, "Such is the object of the work I have undertaken; the result of which will be to show, from reasoning and from facts, that no bounds have been fixed to the improvement of the human faculties; that the ''perfectibility of man'' is absolutely indefinite; that the progress of this perfectibility, henceforth above the controul of every power that would impede it, has no other limit than the duration of the globe upon which nature has placed us."&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/condorcet-outlines-of-an-historical-view-of-the-progress-of-the-human-mind "Outlines of an historical view of the progress of the human mind"] [1795]&lt;/ref&gt; anticipates James' meliorism.

Rousseau's treatment is somewhat weaker&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, J. J., (1754). [http://www.liupoliticalphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/5019_Rousseau_Discourse_on_the_Origin_of_Inequality.pdf "Discourse on the Origin of Inequality"(Translated by G. D. H. Cole)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7914">'''Memorialization''' generally refers to the process of preserving memories of people or events. It can be a form of address or petition, or a ceremony of remembrance or commemoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia
 | title =Memorialization
 | encyclopedia =[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]
 | edition =Online
 | url =http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/memorialization
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | Memorialisation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorialization as a Human Right==
Memorialization is a universal need for both those being memorialized and those who are grieving. Although historically it was limited to the elite and only practiced in the highest societal classes, it is now almost considered a fundamental [[human right]] for all people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memorialized.com/ |title=Memorialized |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2002 |website=Memorialized.com |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorialization and Transitional Justice==
In the context of [[transitional justice]], memorialization is used to honor the victims of  human rights abuses.   Memorials can help governments reconcile tensions with victims by demonstrating respect and acknowledging the past. They can also help to establish a record of history, and to  prevent the recurrence of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/truth-and-memory |title=Truth and Memory |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=[[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ) |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Memorials can also be serious social and political forces in democracy-building efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |first1=Sebastian |last1=Brett |first2=Louis |last2=Bickford |first3=Liz |last3=Ševčenko |first4=Marcela |last4=Rios |date=2007  |title=Memorialization and Democracy: State Policy and Civic Action |url=http://ictj.org/publication/memorialization-and-democracy-state-policy-and-civic-action |publisher=International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ) |format=PDF |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Memorials are also a form of [[Reparations (transitional justice)|reparations]], or compensation efforts that seek to address past [[human rights violations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Memorials in Times of Transition|last = Buckley-Zistel, S. / Schäfer, S. (eds.)|first = |publisher = Intersentia|year = 2014|isbn = 9781780682112|location = Antwerp|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They aim to provide compensation for losses endured by victims of abuse, and remedy prior wrongdoing. They also publicly recognize that victims are entitled to redress and respect. The United Nations Basic Principles on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation  recognizes “commemorations and tributes to the victims” as a form of reparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous  types of memorials used as [[transitional justice]] initiatives. These include architectural memorials, museums, and other commemorative events.  For instance, in northern [[Uganda]], monuments, annual prayer ceremonies, and a mass grave were created in response to the war conducted by and against the [[Lord’s Resistance Army]] there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report

 | publisher  =International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ) 
 | format     =PDF
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[Museum of Memory and Human Rights]] in [[Chile]], which was created to document abuses by the former [[military dictatorship]] there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museodelamemoria.cl/el-museo/sobre-el-museo/ |title=Sobre el Museo |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=20 April 2012 |website=Museo de la Memoria y los Derechos Humanos |language=Spanish |access-date=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges of Memorialization==
Memorialization can arouse controversy and present certain risks. In unstable political situations, memorials may increase desire for revenge and catalyze further violence. They are highly politicized processes that represent the will of those in power. They are thus difficult to shape, and international relief workers, [[Peacekeeping|peacekeepers]], and [[NGOs]] risk being drawn into disputes about the creation or maintenance of memorial sites. Yet they also have the potential to redress historical grievances and enable societies to progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report

{{Economic anthropology}}
A '''moral economy''' is an economy that is based on goodness, fairness, and justice, as opposed to one where the market is assumed to be independent of such concerns. A moral economy is generally only possible in small, closely knit communities, where the principles of [[mutual aid (organization)|mutuality]]—i.e. "I'll scratch your back if you'll scratch mine"—operate to avoid the [[free rider problem]]. Where economic transactions arise between strangers who cannot be sanctioned by a social network, the free rider problem lacks a solution and a moral economy becomes harder to maintain. The concept was an elaboration by English historian [[E.P. Thompson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Edward P.|title=Customs in Common|year=1991|publisher=New Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;, from a term already used by various eighteenth century authors, who felt that economic and moral concerns increasingly seemed to drift apart (see Götz 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Götz | first1 = Norbert | year = 2015 | title = 'Moral economy': its conceptual history and analytical prospects | journal = Journal of Global Ethics | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 147–162 | doi=10.1080/17449626.2015.1054556}}&lt;/ref&gt;). 

Thompson wrote of the moral economy of the poor in the context of widespread food riots in the English countryside in the late eighteenth century. According to Thompson these riots were generally peaceable acts that demonstrated a common political culture rooted in feudal rights to "set the price" of essential goods in the market. These peasants held that a traditional "fair price" was more important to the community than a "free" market price and they punished large farmers who sold their surpluses at higher prices outside the village while there were still those in need within the village. In the 1970s the concept of a moral economy was developed further in anthropological studies of peasant economies. The notion of a non-capitalist cultural mentality using the market for its own ends has been linked by others (with Thompson's approval) to [[subsistence agriculture]] and the need for subsistence insurance in hard times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Edward P.|title=Customs in Common|year=1991|publisher=New Press|location=New York|pages=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cambodiaricefarming1.jpg|thumbnail|Cambodian rice farming]]

==Concept==
The concept was widely popularized in [[anthropology]] through the book ''[[The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and subsistence in Southeast Asia]]'' by [[James C. Scott]] (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=James C.|title=The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and subsistence in Southeast Asia|year=1976|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book begins with a telling metaphor of peasants being like a man standing up to his nose in water; the smallest wave will drown him. Similarly, peasants generally live so close to the subsistence line that it takes little to destroy their livelihoods. From this, he infers a set of economic principles that it would be rational for them to live by. It is important to emphasize that this book was not based on fieldwork, and itself proposed a cross-cultural universalistic model of peasant economic behaviour based upon a set of fixed theoretical principles, not a reading of peasant culture. Firstly, he argued that peasants were "risk averse", or, put differently, followed a "safety first" principle. They would not adopt risky new seeds or technologies, no matter how promising, because tried and true traditional methods had demonstrated, not promised, effectiveness. This gives peasants an unfair reputation as "traditionalist" when in fact they are just risk averse. Secondly, Scott argues that peasant society provides "subsistence insurance" for its members to tide them over those occasions when natural or man-made disaster strikes.

==A just economy==
{{main article|Just price}}
A '''moral economy''', in one interpretation, is an economy that is based on goodness, fairness, and justice.  Such an economy is generally only stable in small, closely knit communities, where the principles of [[mutual aid (organization)|mutuality]]—i.e. "I'll scratch your back if you'll scratch mine"—operate to avoid the [[free rider problem]].  Where economic transactions arise between strangers who cannot be informally sanctioned by a social network, the free rider problem lacks a solution and a moral economy becomes harder to maintain.

In traditional societies, each person and each household is a [[consumer]] as well as a [[production, costs, and pricing|producer]].  [[Social network]]s create mutual understandings to promote the survival of these [[social unit]]s in the face of [[scarcity]]; these social ties operate to prevent the economic actors in traditional societies from behaving to maximize personal [[Profit (economics)|profit]].  Traditional understandings arise as to the relative value of various goods and services; they are not independently renegotiated for each transaction in an impersonal, anonymous [[Market (economics)|market]].  Traditional [[staple food]]s and other goods deemed necessary for the survival of the community acquire customary prices; dearth or plenty should be shared by all.  These traditional understandings acquire the force of [[convention (norm)|custom]], and with increased social complexity may eventually acquire the force of [[law]].

''[[The Efficient Society]]'' by [[Joseph Heath]] discusses the nature of a moral economy in these terms, and argues that [[Canada]] has achieved the proper balance between social needs and [[economic freedom]], and as such comes close to being a moral economy.  Other economists such as [[John P. Powelson]] relate the concept of a "moral economy" to the balance of [[economic power]]; in their view, a moral economy is an economy in which economic factors are balanced against ethical norms in the name of [[social justice]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

''Right Relationship'' by Brown and Garver, discusses the urgent need for achieving an economy that is recognized to be a subsidiary of the overall ecosystem of the planet.  They address key questions regarding the purpose, function, appropriate size, fairness, and governance of a world economic system and propose new ideas to place our economy in correct relationship with the Earth's ecosystem.  They argue that such a '''moral economy''' is essential if we are to avoid systemic collapse as our ''growth economy'' outstrips the Earth's limited ability to recycle our waste, and as the Earth's inventory of critical raw materials and minerals is used up, in the face of growing population and growing affluence within those populations.

==Economics and social norms==
In a related sense, "moral economy" is also a name given in [[economics]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]] to the interplay between [[culture|cultural]] [[mores]] and economic activity.  It describes the various ways in which custom and social pressure coerce economic actors in a society to conform to [[tradition]]al [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]s even at the expense of [[Profit (economics)|profit]].

Prior to the rise of [[classical economics]] in the eighteenth century, the economies in Europe and its North American colonies were governed by a variety of (formal and informal) regulations designed to prevent "greed" from overcoming "morality". In its most formal manifestations, examples such as the traditional [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Islam|Muslim]] prohibitions on [[usury]] represent the limits imposed by religious values on economic activity, and as such are part of the moral economy. [[Law]]s that determine what sort of [[contract]]s will be given effect by the [[judiciary]], and what sort of contracts are [[void (law)|void]] or [[voidable]], often incorporate concepts of a moral economy; in many jurisdictions, traditionally a contract involving [[gambling]] was considered [[void (law)|void in law]] because it was against [[public policy]].  These restrictions on [[freedom of contract]] are the results of moral economy.  According to the beliefs which inspired these laws, economic transactions were supposed to be based on mutual obligation, not individual gain.  In colonial Massachusetts, for example, prices and markets were highly regulated, even the fees physicians could charge.&lt;ref&gt;Horwitz, ''Transformations in American Law'', p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of moral economy are more informal.  In the sixteenth and seventeenth century, for instance, clergymen often preached against various economic practices that were not strictly illegal, but were deemed to be "uncharitable".&lt;ref&gt;Collinson, "Puritanism and the Poor"&lt;/ref&gt; Their condemnations of selling food at high prices or raising rents probably influenced the behavior of many people who regarded themselves as Christian and worried about their reputations.

Likewise, during the rapid expansion of capitalism over the past several centuries, the tradition of a pre-capitalist "moral economy" was used to justify popular action against unscrupulous merchants and traders. For example, the poor regularly rioted against grain merchants who raised their prices in years of dearth in an attempt to reassert the concept of the [[just price]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, "Moral Economy of the English Crowd"; Randall and Charlesworth, ''Moral Economy and Popular Protest''; Bohstedt, ''The Politics of Provisions''&lt;/ref&gt; The Marxist historian [[E. P. Thompson]] emphasized the continuing force of this tradition in his pioneering article on "The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century" (1971). Later historians and sociologists have uncovered the same phenomenon in a variety of other situations, including peasants' riots in continental Europe during the nineteenth century and in many developing countries in the twentieth. The political scientist [[James C. Scott]], for example, showed how this ideology could be used as a method of resisting authority in ''[[The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Subsistence and Rebellion in Southeast Asia]]'' (1976).

It must be remembered, however, that sometimes a moral economy may not act in conformity to [[morality]] as it is now generally understood.  Social pressures to enforce [[racial segregation]] even when willing buyers and sellers would erode the racial barriers, are clearly an example of cultural pressures imposing economic inefficiency, and therefore fall within the purview of moral economy.&lt;ref&gt;Van Tessel, "Only the Law"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Utopian moral economies==
In modern times, "utopian moral economies" have arisen to systematically reorganize their economic system to reflect a particular moral or ethical code that rejects the free-market ethos of capitalist economies. Societies that pursue some derivative of [[Socialism]] or [[Communism]] are obvious examples of this impulse, along with small-scale attempts in the form of the Israeli [[kibbutz]] and the [[intentional communities]] of the 1960s and 70s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Very few of these experiments—with the possible exception of the kibbutz—turned out the way their founders had imagined. Unsurprisingly, a revolutionary reorganization of some of the most fundamental parts of society often resulted in the severe dislocation of many people's everyday lives and the loss of whole generations to schemes like Stalin's failed policy of [[collective farming]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} However, many of the small and pragmatic attempts to make the capitalist economy more moral (e.g. fair trade, moral investment funds, the development of renewable energy sources, recycling, cooperatives, etc.) have grown from the same impulse that drove the utopian revolutionaries. These developments, however, do not fully realize their intentions, being fundamentally at odds with the mechanisms in the capitalist economy, such as cyclical consumption, the inherent duplicity of goods in competition, and the process of "externalizing" those costs which are not directly pertinent to an actor's finances.

[[File:もったいない (5305643094).jpg|thumb|''Mottainai'' written on a truck, followed by the sentence "I strive towards [[zero emission]]"]]

'''''Mottainai''''' is a term of Japanese origin that has been used by environmentalists.  The term in Japanese conveys a sense of regret over waste; the exclamation "''Mottainai!'' can translate as "What a waste!"  Japanese environmentalists have used the term to encourage people to "[[Waste hierarchy|reduce, reuse and recycle]]", and [[Kenya]]n environmentalist [[Wangari Maathai]] used the term at the [[United Nations]] as a slogan to promote environmental protection.

== Usage and translation ==

''Mottainai'' is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term conveying a sense of [[regret]] concerning [[waste]].&lt;ref name="daijirin"&gt;[https://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%8B%BF%E4%BD%93%E7%84%A1%E3%81%84-645881#E5.A4.A7.E8.BE.9E.E6.9E.97.20.E7.AC.AC.E4.B8.89.E7.89.88 Daijirin Japanese dictionary 2nd ed.] (Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; The expression "Mottainai!" can be uttered alone as an exclamation when something useful, such as food or time, is wasted, meaning roughly "what a waste!" In addition to its primary sense of "wastefulness", the word is also used to mean "impious; irreverent" or "more than one deserves".&lt;ref&gt;Masuda, K: Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary, page 1139. Kenkyusha Ltd., 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mottainai'' in Japanese refers both to physical waste and to wasteful action.  MacQuillan and Preston propose a more elaborate translation that conveys a sense of value and worthiness as "do not destroy (or lay waste to) that which is worthy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alan G. MacQuillan |author2=Ashley L. Preston |title=Globally and Locally: Seeking a Middle Path to Sustainable Development |year=1998 |publisher=University Press of America |location= |isbn=0761811265 |page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Modern Japanese environmentalism ===
In November 2002, the English-language, Japan-based magazine ''[[Look Japan]]'' ran a cover story entitled "Restyling Japan: Revival of the 'Mottainai' Spirit", documenting the motivation amongst volunteers in a "toy hospital" in Japan to "develop in children the habit of looking after their possessions," the re-emergence of repair shops specializing in repairing household appliances or children's clothes, the recycling of [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] bottles and other materials, the collection of waste [[edible oil]], and more generally the efforts to stop the trend of throwing away everything that can no longer be used, i.e. the efforts of reviving "the spirit of ''mottainai''".&lt;ref name="look-japan-2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chiba |first=Hitoshi |date=November 2002 |title=Restyling Japan: Revival of the "Mottainai" Spirit |journal=[[Look Japan]] |url=http://www.lookjapan.com/LBcoverstory/02NovCS.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040405084940/http://www.lookjapan.com/LBcoverstory/02NovCS.htm |archivedate=April 5, 2004 |accessdate=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that context, Hitoshi Chiba, the author, described ''mottainai'' as follows:

{{cquote|We often hear in Japan the expression 'mottainai', which loosely means 'wasteful' but in its full sense conveys a feeling of awe and appreciation for the gifts of nature or the sincere conduct of other people. There is a trait among Japanese people to try to use something for its entire effective life or continue to use it by repairing it. In this caring culture, people will endeavor to find new homes for possessions they no longer need. The 'mottainai' principle extends to the dinner table, where many consider it rude to leave even a single grain of rice in the bowl. The concern is that this traditional trait may be lost.&lt;ref name="look-japan-2002"/&gt;}}

A modern observance that practices mottainai{{clarify|reason=no meaning to "practising" wasteful|date=March 2018}} is the yearly festival of [[Hari-Kuyō]], or the Festival of Broken Needles.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

At the Opening Ceremony of the Science and Technology in Society Forum in 2005, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi stated: "In Japan, there has long been a spirit characterized by the word ''mottainai'', which could be translated as 'don't waste what is valuable'."&lt;ref name=Koizumi2005&gt;{{cite web|url=https://japan.kantei.go.jp/koizumispeech/2005/09/11press_e.html|title=Speeches and Statements by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi|website=japan.kantei.go.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tremblement oculaire.jpg|thumb|Ocular microtremor tracing with burst sections underlined]]
'''Ocular microtremor''' ('''OMT''') is a constant, physiological, high frequency (peak 80Hz), low amplitude (estimated circa 150-2500nm (1)) [[human eye|eye]] [[tremor]].  

It occurs in all normal people even when the eye is apparently still and is due to the constant activity of brainstem [[oculomotor]] units. In [[coma]] there is a loss of high frequency components of tremor and the extent of this reduction is related to the patient's prognosis (2). Ocular microtremor can potentially help in the difficult diagnosis of brainstem death, as well as monitoring patients while under anaesthesia (3). Abnormal OMT records are seen in neurological conditions such as [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[multiple sclerosis]](4). The frequency spectrum also changes with age. 

The first description of what is now known as ocular microtremor was made in 1934 (5). More recent studies are less common for ocular microtremor than for other [[Fixation (visual)|fixational eye movements]]. Some have suggested that the reason ocular microtremor studies are more rare may be because of the difficulty inherent in measuring microtremor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alexander |first1=Robert |last2=Macknik |first2=Stephen |last3=Martinez-Conde |first3=Susana |title=Microsaccade Characteristics in Neurological and Ophthalmic Disease |journal=Frontiers in Neurology |date=2018 |volume=9 |issue=144 |pages=144 |doi=10.3389/fneur.2018.00144|pmid=29593642 |pmc=5859063 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is contentious whether ocular microtremor assists vision.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Visual processes deteriorate rapidly in the absence of retinal image motion, with [[Stabilized Images]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1167/3.11.18|pmid=14765967|title=Contributions of fixational eye movements to the discrimination of briefly presented stimuli|journal=Journal of Vision|volume=3|issue=11|pages=852–64|year=2003|last1=Rucci|first1=Michele|last2=Desbordes|first2=Gaëlle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have suggested that tremor may not be a distinct eye movement at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1145/1743666.1743714|chapter=Eye tracking with the adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope|title=Proceedings of the 2010 Symposium on Eye-Tracking Research &amp; Applications - ETRA '10|pages=195|year=2010|last1=Stevenson|first1=Scott B.|last2=Roorda|first2=Austin|last3=Kumar|first3=Girish|isbn=9781605589947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Festival Ringing Cedars 2014 June 22 Димон 05.jpg|thumb|An elderly woman at a [[Ringing Cedars]]' settlement in [[Russia]].]]
'''Old age''' refers to ages nearing or surpassing the life expectancy of human beings, and is thus the end of the human [[biological life cycle|life cycle]]. Terms and euphemisms include '''old people''', '''the elderly''' (worldwide usage), '''seniors''' (American usage), '''senior citizens''' (British and American usages), '''older adults''' (in the social sciences&lt;ref&gt;''Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 6th edition'' (American Psychological Association, 2009) {{ISBN|1433805618}}{{page needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and '''the elders''' (in many cultures—including the cultures of aboriginal people).

Old people often have limited regenerative abilities and are more susceptible to disease, syndromes, injuries and sickness than younger adults. The organic process of [[ageing]] is called [[senescence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/senescence |title=Senescence – definition of senescence by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the medical study of the aging process is called [[gerontology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/gerontology |title=Gerontology – definition of gerontology by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the study of diseases that afflict the elderly is called [[geriatrics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/geriatrics |title=Geriatrics – definition of geriatrics by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elderly also face other social issues around [[retirement]], [[loneliness]], and [[ageism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24572231 |title=Jeremy Hunt highlights plight of 'chronically lonely' – BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old age is not a definite biological stage, as the chronological age denoted as "old age" varies culturally and historically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198568506.001.0001/acref-9780198568506-e-4834?rskey=7F4W2c&amp;result=4834 |title=Old age |publisher=Oxford Reference |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[United Nations]] proposed a human rights convention that would specifically protect older persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/OlderPersons/Pages/OlderPersonsIndex.aspx|title=OHCHR - 	 	Human rights of older persons|website=www.ohchr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
[[Image:Maes Old Woman Dozing.jpg|thumb|upright|''Old Woman Dozing'' by [[Nicolaes Maes]] (1656). [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Royal Museums of Fine Arts]], [[Brussels]]]]
Definitions of old age include official definitions, sub-group definitions, and four dimensions as follows.

===Official definitions===
Old age comprises "the later part of life; the period of life after youth and middle age . . ., usually with reference to deterioration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://0-www.oed.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu/view/Entry/258473?redirectedFrom=old+age&amp; |title=Millennium Web Catalog |publisher=0-www.oed.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; At what age old age begins cannot be universally defined because it differs according to the context. The United Nations has agreed that 65+ years may be usually denoted as old age&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/ageingdefnolder/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Definition of an older or elderly person |publisher=Who.int |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this is the first attempt at an international definition of old age. However, for its study of old age in Africa, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) set 55 as the beginning of old age. At the same time, the WHO recognized that the developing world often defines old age, not by years, but by new roles, loss of previous roles, or inability to make active contributions to society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/ageing_mds_report_en_daressalaam.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Most developed Western countries set the age of 60 to 65 for retirement. Being 60–65 years old is usually a requirement for becoming eligible for senior social programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/health/medicare-insurance/info-04-2011/medicare-eligibility.html|title=Medicare Eligibility Requirements – How to Qualify for Medicare – AARP Everyw...|last=Barry|first=Patricia|website=AARP|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, various countries and societies consider the onset of old age as anywhere from the mid-40s to the 70s.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Editors |first=The |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/426737/old-age |title=old age |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definitions of old age continue to change especially as life expectancy in developed countries has risen to beyond 80 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mailman.columbia.edu/academic-departments/centers/columbia-aging/about-us |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212141539/http://www.mailman.columbia.edu/academic-departments/centers/columbia-aging/about-us |archivedate=December 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, a paper published in the science journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' presented the conclusion that the maximum [[Ageing|human lifespan]] is an average age of 115, with an absolute upper limit of 125 years.&lt;ref name="NAT-20151005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dong |first1=Xiao |last2=Milholland |first2=Brandon |last3=Vijg |first3=Jan |title=Evidence for a limit to human lifespan |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature19793.html |date=October 5, 2016 |doi=10.1038/nature19793 |accessdate=October 6, 2016 |volume=538 |journal=Nature |pages=257–259 |pmid=27706136|bibcode=2016Natur.538..257D }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the authors' methods and conclusions drew criticism from the scientific community, who concluded that the study was flawed.&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=van Santen|first1=Hester|title=Peer review post-mortem: how a flawed aging study was published in Nature|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/12/09/how-weak-science-slipped-past-through-review-and-landed-in-a-top-journal-a1535637|accessdate=11 December 2016|publisher=NRC|date=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sub-group definitions{{anchor|Third age}}&lt;!--[[Third age (retirement)]] redirects here--&gt;===
Gerontologists have recognized the very different conditions that people experience as they grow older within the years defined as old age. In developed countries, most people in their 60s and early 70s are still fit, active, and able to care for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 607.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after 75, they will become increasingly [[Frailty syndrome|frail]], a condition marked by serious mental and physical debilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=204046 |title=JAMA Network &amp;#124; JAMA &amp;#124; Frailty in Older Adults |publisher=Jama.jamanetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, rather than lumping together all people who have been defined as old, some gerontologists have recognized the diversity of old age by defining sub-groups. One study distinguishes the young old (60 to 69), the middle old (70 to 79), and the very old (80+).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1727842|year=1992|author1=Forman|first1=D.

A.|last2=Ellison|first2=K. J.|last3=Wernette|first3=C. M.|pmc=2657166}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third sub-grouping is "young old" (65–74), "old" (74–84), and "old-old" (85+).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transgenerational.org/aging/demographics.htm |title=Demographics of Aging |publisher=Transgenerational.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delineating sub-groups in the 65+ population enables a more accurate portrayal of significant life changes.&lt;ref&gt;Victor G. Cicirelli, ''Older Adults' Views on Death'' (Springer, 2002), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two British scholars, Paul Higgs and Chris Gilleard, have added a "fourth age" sub-group. In British English, the "third age" is "the period in life of active retirement, following middle age".&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v. "third age".&lt;/ref&gt; Higgs and Gilleard describe the fourth age as "an arena of inactive, unhealthy, unproductive, and ultimately unsuccessful ageing".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Higgs and Chris Gilleard, ''Rethinking Old Age: Theorizing the Fourth Age'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2015), vii, 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dimensions of old age===
''Key Concepts in Social Gerontology'' lists four dimensions: chronological, biological, psychological, and social.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Judith, Kristine Ajrouch, and Sarah Hillcoat-Nallétamby, ''Key Concepts in Social Gerontology'' (SAGE Publications, 2010), 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Wattis and Curran add a fifth dimension: developmental.&lt;ref&gt;John Wattis, Stephen Curran, ''Practical Psychiatry of Old Age'' (Radcliffe Publishing, 2006). 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Chronological age may differ considerably from a person's functional age. The distinguishing marks of old age normally occur in all five senses at different times and different rates for different persons.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010319220229/http://ohioline.osu.edu/ss-fact/0101.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to chronological age, people can be considered old because of the other dimensions of old age. For example, people may be considered old when they become grandparents or when they begin to do less or different work in retirement.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

===Senior citizen===
Senior citizen is a common euphemism for an old person used in [[American English]], and sometimes in [[British English]]. It implies that the person being referred to is retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl |title=Oxford Learner's Dictionaries &amp;#124; Find the meanings, definitions, pictures, pronunciation of words at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com |publisher=Oup.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/36/S0263600.html|title=Bartleby.com: Great Books Online – Quotes, Poems, Novels, Classics and hundreds more|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420174106/http://www.bartleby.com/61/36/S0263600.html|archivedate=20 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/features/chref/chref.py/main?query=senior+citizen&amp;title=21st |title=www.chambersharrap.co.uk |publisher=www.chambersharrap.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=71747&amp;dict=CALD |title=senior citizen Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |date=2016-03-30 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn usually implies that the person is over the [[retirement age]], which varies according to country. Synonyms include '''old age pensioner''' or '''pensioner''' in British English, and '''retiree''' and '''senior''' in American English. Some dictionaries describe widespread use of "senior citizen" for people over the age of 65.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/senior-citizen |title=senior citizen – Definition from Longman English Dictionary Online |publisher=Ldoceonline.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When defined in an official context, ''senior citizen'' is often used for legal or policy-related reasons in determining who is eligible for certain benefits available to the age group.

It is used in general usage instead of traditional terms such as ''old person'', ''old-age pensioner'', or ''elderly'' as a courtesy and to signify continuing relevance of and respect for this population group as "[[citizen]]s" of society, of ''senior'' rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waughfield|first1=Claire G.|last2=Burckhalter|first2=Teresa S.|title=Mental health concepts|date=2002|publisher=Delmar/Thomson Learning|location=Clifton Park, NY|isbn=9780766838307|page=64|edition=5th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xylg46v5fRUC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64|accessdate=4 April 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was apparently coined in 1938 during a political campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theseniortimes.com/richler.htm|title=The Senior Times Online|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famed caricaturist [[Al Hirschfeld]] claimed on several occasion that his father Isaac Hirschfeld invented the term 'senior citizen'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIgT8dfbX1wC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=al+hirschfeld+father+coined+senior+citizen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OvOd6pwp_A&amp;sig=5O-oLxdttOny8StHEODJ38LkG88&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwigsc32y-jJAhWClR4KHYbTDakQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=al%20hirschfeld%20father%20coined%20senior%20citizen&amp;f=false | title=Hirschfeld: On Line | publisher=Applause Theatre &amp; Cinema Books | page=10 | date=February 1, 2000| accessdate=December 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| people = Al Hirschfeld| title = The Line King: The Al Hirschfeld Story | medium = VHS| publisher = Cabin Fever Entertainment| date = 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,417721,00.html | title=That Old Feeling: The Fun in Al Hirschfeld | publisher=TIME | author=Richard Corliss | date=January 29, 2003| accessdate=December 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has come into widespread use in recent decades in legislation, commerce, and common speech. Especially in less formal contexts, it is often abbreviated as "senior(s)", which is also used as an [[adjective]].

In commerce, some businesses offer customers of a certain age a "[[senior discount]]". The age at which these discounts are available varies between 55, 60, 62 or 65, and other criteria may also apply. Sometimes a special "[[senior discount card]]" or other proof of age needs to be obtained and produced to show entitlement.

====Age qualifications====

The age which qualifies for senior citizen status varies widely. In governmental contexts, it is usually associated with an age at which [[pension]]s or medical benefits for the elderly become available. In commercial contexts, where it may serve as a [[marketing]] device to attract customers, the age is often significantly lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ahn Shin-Hyun |url=http://www.seriworld.org/01/wldContVod.html?mn=A&amp;mncd=0301&amp;sort=A&amp;gubun=00&amp;p_page=65&amp;natcd=KR&amp;key=20110404000005 |title=Economic Report |publisher=SERIWorld |date=2011-04-04 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the standard retirement age is currently 66 (gradually increasing to 67).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/ageincrease.html |title=Retirement Age Calculator |publisher=Ssa.gov |date=2014-09-03 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the OAS (Old Age Security) pension is available at 65 (the Conservative government of Stephen Harper had planned to gradually increase the age of eligibility to 67, starting in the years 2023–2029, although the Liberal government of Justin Trudeau is considering leaving it at 65),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/isp/oas/changes/index.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102073722/http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/isp/oas/changes/index.shtml |archivedate=November 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the CPP (Canada Pension Plan) as early as age 60.

The [[AARP]] allows couples in which one spouse has reached the age of 50 to join, regardless of the age of the other spouse.

==Marks of old age==
{{See also|Ageing#Effects of ageing}} 

The distinguishing characteristics of old age are both physical and mental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1891555|year=1991|author1=Salokangas|first1=R. K.|title=Physical and mental health changes in retirement age|journal=Psychotherapy and psychosomatics|volume=55|issue=2–4|pages=100–7|last2=Joukamaa|first2=M|doi=10.1159/000288415}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marks of old age are so unlike the marks of middle age that legal scholar Richard Posner suggests that, as an individual transitions into old age, he/she can be thought of as different persons "time-sharing" the same identity.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner, ''Aging and Old Age'' (University of Chicago, 1997), 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

These marks do not occur at the same chronological age for everyone. Also, they occur at different rates and order for different people.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Marks of old age can easily vary between people of the same chronological age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communities.qld.gov.au/resources/communityservices/seniors/publications/ageing-myth-reality.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 19, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216170927/http://www.communities.qld.gov.au/resources/communityservices/seniors/publications/ageing-myth-reality.pdf |archivedate=December 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A basic mark of old age that affects both body and mind is "slowness of behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.ps.46.020195.001553|pmid=7872732|title=Aging and Speed of Behavior: Possible Consequences for Psychological Functioning|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=46|pages=329–53|year=1995|last1=Birren|first1=J E|last2=Fisher|first2=L M}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "slowing down principle" finds a correlation between advancing age and slowness of reaction and physical and mental task performance.&lt;ref&gt;Donald H. Kausler and Barry C. Kausler, ''The Graying of America: An Encyclopedia of Aging, Health, Mind, and Behavior'' (University of Illinois, 2001), 376–377.&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies from Buffalo University and Northwestern University have shown that the elderly are a happier age group than their younger counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Updated 1553 GMT (2253 HKT) April 24, 2015 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/24/health/old-people-happy/ |title=Older people are happier than you.

===Physical marks of old age===
Physical marks of old age include the following:

*Bone and joint. Old bones are marked by "thinning and shrinkage". This might result in a loss of height (about two&amp;nbsp;inches (5&amp;nbsp;cm) by age 80), a stooping posture in many people, and a greater susceptibility to bone and joint diseases such as [[osteoarthritis]] and [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref name="wahsa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wahsa.org/agingprocess.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030211939/http://wahsa.org/agingprocess.pdf |archivedate=October 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="documbase1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.documbase.com/The-Normal-Aging-Process.pdf |title=The Normal Aging Process – PDF documents |publisher=Documbase.com |date=2012-01-01 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/health/osteoporosis-diagnosis#Overview1|title=Osteoporosis Tests and Diagnosis|publisher=Healthline|date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chronic diseases. Some older persons have at least one [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic condition]] and many have multiple conditions. In 2007–2009, the most frequently occurring conditions among older persons in the United States were uncontrolled [[hypertension]] (34%), diagnosed arthritis (50%), and heart disease (32%).&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoa.gov/Aging_Statistics/Profile/2011/docs/2011profile.pdf|title=Administration on Aging&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|access-date=2014-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010053036/http://www.aoa.gov/Aging_Statistics/Profile/2011/docs/2011profile.pdf|archive-date=2013-10-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chronic mucus hypersecretion (CMH) "defined as coughing and bringing up [[sputum]] . . . is a common respiratory symptom in elderly persons."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/21/40_suppl/10s |title=Determinants of prognosis of COPD in the elderly: mucus hypersecretion, infections, cardiovascular comorbidity &amp;#124; European Respiratory Society |journal=European Respiratory Journal |volume=21 |pages=10S–14s |date=2003-05-01 |accessdate=2016-04-04|doi=10.1183/09031936.03.00403403 |last1=Pistelli |first1=R. |last2=Lange |first2=P. |last3=Miller |first3=D.L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dental problems. May have less [[saliva]] and less ability for [[oral hygiene]] in old age which increases the chance of [[Dental caries|tooth decay and infection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/helping-your-elder-with-grooming-and-hygiene.html |title=Helping Your Elder with Grooming and Hygiene – For Dummies |publisher=Dummies.com |date=2008-11-07 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Digestive system. About 40% of the time, old age is marked by digestive disorders such as difficulty in swallowing, inability to eat enough and to absorb nutrition, constipation and bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.JohnsHopkinsHealthAlerts.com |title=Health After 50: News on Prostate Cancer, Arthritis, Heart Disease, and other conditions which affect Health After 50 |publisher=Johnshopkinshealthalerts.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Essential Tremor (ET) is an uncontrollable shaking in a part of the upper body. It is more common in the elderly and symptoms worsen with age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/brain/essential-tremor-basics |title=Essential Tremor: Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment |publisher=Webmd.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Eyesight. [[Presbyopia]] can occur by age 50 and it hinders reading especially of small print in low lighting. Speed with which an individual reads and the ability to locate objects may also be impaired.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/resources/guides/older.aspx|title=Older Adults' Health and Age-Related Changes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By age 80, more than half of all Americans either have a [[cataract]] or have had [[cataract surgery]].&lt;ref name=NIH2009&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts About Cataract|url=https://www.nei.nih.gov/health/cataract/cataract_facts|accessdate=14 August 2016|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf.

*Gait change. Some aspects of [[Gait (human)|gait]] normally change with old age. Gait velocity slows after age 70. Double stance time (i.e., time with both feet on the ground) also increases with age. Because of gait change, old people sometimes appear to be walking on ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Judge |first=James O. |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/geriatrics/gait-disorders-in-the-elderly/gait-disorders-in-the-elderly |title=Gait Disorders in the Elderly – Geriatrics – Merck Manuals Professional Edition |publisher=Merckmanuals.com |date=2016-03-25 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental marks of old age===
Mental marks of old age include the following:

*Adaptable describes most people in their old age. Despite the stressfulness of old age, they are described as "agreeable" and "accepting". However, old age dependence induces feelings of incompetence and worthlessness in a minority.&lt;ref&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 608–609.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Caution marks old age. This antipathy toward "risk-taking" stems from the fact that old people have less to gain and more to lose by taking risks than younger people.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner, ''Aging and Old Age'' (University of Chicago, 1995), 112, 116.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Depressed mood.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy G.J. The epidemiology of late-life depression. In: Kennedy G. J, editor. Suicide and depression in late life: Critical issues in treatment, research and public policy. New York: John Wiley and Sons; 1996. pp. 23–37.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cox, [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson|Abramson]], [[Patricia Devine|Devine]], and Hollon (2012), old age is a risk factor for depression caused by prejudice (i.e., "deprejudice"). When people are prejudiced against the elderly and then become old themselves, their anti-elderly prejudice turns inward, causing depression. "People with more negative age stereotypes will likely have higher rates of depression as they get older."&lt;ref name="Cox et al. (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1745691612455204|title=Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Depression: The Integrated Perspective|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|volume=7|issue=5|pages=427–449|year=2012|last1=Cox|first1=W.

Berk, Development Through the Lifespan, (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 610.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Fear of crime in old age, especially among the frail, sometimes weighs more heavily than concerns about finances or health and restricts what they do. The fear persists in spite of the fact that old people are victims of crime less often than younger people.&lt;ref&gt;Laura E. Berk, Development Through the Lifespan, (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 617.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increasing fear of health loss.
*Mental disorders afflict about 15% of people aged 60+ according to estimates by the World Health Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs381/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Mental health and older adults |publisher=Who.int |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another survey taken in 15 countries reported that mental disorders of adults interfered with their daily activities more than physical problems.&lt;ref name="Laura E.

*Set in one's ways describes a mind set of old age.&lt;ref&gt;George P. Moschis, ''Marketing to Older Consumers'' (Praeger, 1992), 102.&lt;/ref&gt; A study of over 400 distinguished men and women in old age found a "preference for the routine".&lt;ref&gt;Martin S. Lindauer, ''Aging, Creativity, and Art'' (Springer, 2003), 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Explanations include old age's toll on the "fluid intelligence" and the "more deeply entrenched" ways of the old.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner, ''Aging and Old Age'' (University of Chicago, 1995), 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceptions of old age==

===Old age from a middle-age perspective===
Many books by middle-age writers depict their perceptions of old people.&lt;ref&gt;''How to Survive Your Aging Parents'' (Surrey, 2001); ''Are Your Parents Driving You Crazy?'' (Vanderwyk &amp; Burnham, 2005); ''Coping With Your Difficult Older Parent: A Guide for Stressed-Out Children'' (William Morrow, 1999); ''Caring for Yourself While Caring for Your Aging Parents: How to Help, How to Survive'' (Holt, 2005); ''The Caregiver's Survival Handbook: Caring for Your Aging Parents Without Losing Yourself'' (Perigee, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; One writer notices the change in his parents: they move slowly, they have lost strength, they repeat stories, their minds wander, and they fret.&lt;ref&gt;David Solie, ''How to Say It to Seniors: Closing the Communication Gap with Our Elders'' (Prentice Hall, 2004), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer sees her aged parents and is bewildered: they refuse to follow her advice, they are obsessed with the past, they avoid risk, they live at a "glacial pace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matthiessen |first=Connie |url=http://www.caring.com/articles/elderly-communication |title=Elderly Communication &amp;#124; Communicating with Stubborn Elderly Parents |publisher=Caring.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers treat the perceptions of middle-age people regarding their own old age. In her ''The Denial of Aging'', Dr. Muriel R. Gillick, a [[Baby boomers|baby boomer]], accuses her contemporaries of believing that by proper exercise and diet they can avoid the scourges of old age and proceed from middle age to death.&lt;ref&gt;Gillick, ''The Denial of Aging: Perpetual Youth, Eternal Life, and Other Dangerous Fantasies'' (Harvard, 2007), 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies find that many people in the 55–75 range can postpone morbidity by practicing healthy lifestyles. These discourses take part in a general idea of [[successful ageing]]. However, at about age 80, all people experience similar morbidity.&lt;ref&gt;Waneen Wyrick Spirduso, Karen L. Francis, Priscilla G. MacRae, ''Physical Dimensions of Aging'' (Human Kinetics, 2004), 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Even with healthy lifestyles, most 85+ people will undergo extended "frailty and disability".&lt;ref&gt;Susan Jacoby, ''Never Say Die: The Myth and Marketing of the New Old Age'' (Pantheon, 2011), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old age from an old-age perspective===
Early old age is a pleasant time; children are grown, retirement from work, time to pursue interests.&lt;ref&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'' (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 603.&lt;/ref&gt; Many people are also willing to get involved in community and [[Activist ageing|activist organizations]] to promote their well-being. In contrast, perceptions of old age by writers 80+ years old (old age in the real meaning of the term&lt;ref name="Tor Inge Romoren 2003"/&gt;) tend to be negative.

{{illm|Georges Minois|WD=Q921484}} writes that the first man to talk about his old age was an Egyptian scribe who lived 4,500 years ago. The scribe addressed God with a prayer of lament:&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;O Sovereign my Lord!  Oldness has come; old age has descended. Feebleness has arrived; dotage is here anew. The heart sleeps wearily every day.&lt;br/&gt; The eyes are weak, the ears are deaf, the strength is disappearing because of weariness of the heart and the mouth is silent and cannot speak.&lt;br/&gt; The heart is forgetful and cannot recall yesterday. The bone suffers old age. Good is become evil. All taste is gone. What old age does to men is evil in every respect.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989) Minois, 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Minois comments that the scribe's "cry shows that nothing has changed in the drama of decrepitude between the age of the Pharaoh and the atomic age" and "expresses all the anguish of old people in the past and the present".&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989)  Minois, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lillian B. Rubin|Lillian Rubin]], active in her 80s as an author, sociologist, and psychotherapist, opens her book ''60 on Up: The Truth about Aging in America'' with "getting old sucks. It always has, it always will." Dr. Rubin contrasts the "real old age" with the "rosy pictures" painted by middle-age writers.&lt;ref&gt;Lillian B. Rubin, ''60 on Up: The Truth About Aging in America'' (Beacon, 2007), 1, 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing at the age of 87, Mary C. Morrison delineates the heroism required by old age: to live through the disintegration of one's own body or that of someone you love. Morrison concludes, "old age is not for the fainthearted."&lt;ref&gt;Mary C. Morrison, ''Let Evening Come'' (1998), 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''Life Beyond 85 Years'', the 150 interviewees had to cope with physical and mental debilitation and with losses of loved ones. One interviewee described living in old age as "pure hell".&lt;ref&gt;Colleen Johnson and Barbara M. Barer, ''Life Beyond 85 Years'' (Prometheus, 2003), 7–8, 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old age from society's perspective===
Based on his survey of old age in history, [[:fr:Georges Minois|Georges Minois]] concludes that "it is clear that always and everywhere youth has been preferred to old age." In Western thought, "old age is an evil, an infirmity and a dreary time of preparation for death." Furthermore, death is often preferred over "decrepitude, because death means deliverance".&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989)  Minois, 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The problem of the ambiguity of old age has . . . been with us since the stage of primitive society; it was both the source of wisdom and of infirmity, experience and decrepitude, of prestige and suffering."&lt;ref name="Georges Minois 1989"&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989)  Minois, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]] of Greek and Roman cultures, old age was denigrated as a time of "decline and decrepitude".&lt;ref&gt;Susan M. Hillier and Georgia M. Barrow, ''Aging, The Individual &amp; Society'' (Cengage, 10th edition, 2014), 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; "Beauty and strength" were esteemed and old age was viewed as defiling and ugly. Old age was reckoned as one of the unanswerable "great mysteries" along with evil, pain, and suffering. "Decrepitude, which shrivels heroes, seemed worse than death."&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989), 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Medieval and Renaissance periods depicted old age as "cruel or weak".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Susan M. Hillier and Georgia M. Barrow, ''Aging, The Individual &amp; Society'' (Cengage, 10th edition, 2014), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical periods reveal a mixed picture of the "position and status" of old people, but there has never been a "golden age of aging".&lt;ref name="Susan M 2014"&gt;Susan M. Hillier and Georgia M. Barrow, ''Aging, The Individual &amp; Society'' (Cengage, 10th edition, 2014), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have disproved the popular belief that in the past old people were venerated by society and cared for by their families.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson and [[Pat Thane]], editors, ''Old Age from Antiquity to Post-Modernity'' (Routledge, 1998), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Veneration for and antagonism toward the aged have coexisted in complex relationships throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/old-age |title=The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions |publisher=Answers |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Old people were respected or despised, honoured or put to death according to circumstance."&lt;ref name="Georges Minois 1989"/&gt;

In ancient times, although some strong and healthy people lived until they were over 70 most died before they were 50. The general understanding is that those who lived into their 40's were treated with respect and awe. In contrast, those who were frail were seen as a burden and ignored or in extreme cases killed.&lt;ref name="Susan M 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GuqFh1Ff3rgC&amp;dq=ancient%20%20old%20age%20Most%20people%20died%20before%20they%20were%20%2050&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Oxford Handbook of Retirement|first=Mo|last=Wang|date=8 November 2012|publisher=OUP USA|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; People were defined as "old" because of their inability to perform useful tasks rather than their years.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson and [[Pat Thane]], editors, ''Old Age from Antiquity to Post-Modernity'' (Routledge, 1998), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]] did not like old people." Their youth rebelled against the old, driving them off or killing them.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989), 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he was skeptical of the gods, [[Aristotle]] concurred in the dislike of old people. In his ''Ethics'', he wrote that "old people are miserly; they do not acknowledge disinterested friendship; only seeking for what can satisfy their selfish needs."&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989), 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th-century Utopians, [[Thomas More]] and [[Antonio de Guevara]], allowed no decrepit old people in their fictional lands.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989), 277–278, 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Thomas More, on the island of [[Utopia (book)|Utopia]], when people are so old as to have "out-lived themselves" and are terminally ill, in pain, and a burden to everyone, the priests exhort them about choosing to die. The priests assure them that "they shall be happy after death." If they choose to die, they end their lives by starvation or by taking opium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/Utopia_T.pdf|title=Utopia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonio de Guevara]]'s utopian nation "had a custom, not to live longer than sixty five years". At that age, they practiced self-immolation. Rather than condemn the practice, Bishop Guevara called it a "golden world" in which people "have overcome the natural appetite to desire to live".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015002444985 |title=The diall of princes: by Don Anthony of Guevara: tr. by Sir Thomas ... – Full View &amp;#124; HathiTrust Digital Library &amp;#124; HathiTrust Digital Library |publisher=Babel.hathitrust.org |date=2012-08-18 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Modern period, the "cultural status" of old people has declined in many cultures.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; [[Joan Erikson]] observed that "aged individuals are often ostracized, neglected, and overlooked; elders are seen no longer as bearers of wisdom but as embodiments of shame."&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on age-related attitudes consistently finds that negative attitudes exceed positive attitudes toward old people because of their looks and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Birren and K Warner Schaie, eds., ''Handbook of the Psychology of Aging'' (Academic, 2011), 253.&lt;/ref&gt; In his study ''Aging and Old Age'', Posner discovers "resentment and disdain of older people" in American society.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner, ''Aging and Old Age'' (University of Chicago, 1997), 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard University's [[implicit-association test]] measures implicit "attitudes and beliefs" about Young vis a vis Old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/selectatest.html |title=ProjectImplicit |publisher=Implicit.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blind Spot: Hidden Biases of Good People'', a book about the test, reports that 80% of Americans have an "automatic preference for the young over old" and that attitude is true worldwide. The young are "consistent in their negative attitude" toward the old.&lt;ref&gt;Mahzarin R. Banaji and Anthony G. Greenwald, ''Blind Spot: Hidden Biases of Good People'' (Random House, 2013), 67.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ageism'' documents that Americans generally have "little tolerance for older persons and very few reservations about harboring negative attitudes" about them.&lt;ref&gt;Todd D. Nelson, ed, ''Ageism: Stereotyping and Prejudice Against Older Persons'' (Bradford, 2004), ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its prevalence, [[ageism]] is seldom the subject of public discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Judith E Phillips and others, ''Key Concepts in Social Gerontology'' (Sage, 2010), 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a documentary film called ''[[The Age of Love (2014 film)|The Age of Love]]'' used humor and poignant adventures of 30 seniors who attend a speed dating event for 70- to 90-year-olds, and discovered how the search for romance changes; or does not change; from a [[childhood sweetheart]] to older age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Staff |first=Writer |url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/feb/02/documentary-tracks-seniors-in-search-of-love/ |title=Documentary tracks seniors in search of love |work=The Spokesman-Review |date=2015-02-02 |accessdate=2015-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old age from simulated perspective===
[[Simone de Beauvoir]] wrote that "there is one form of experience that belongs only to those that are old – that of old age itself."&lt;ref&gt;Simone de Beauvoir, ''The Coming of Age'', trans by Patrick O'Brian (Norton, 1996), 381.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, simulations of old age attempt to help younger people gain some understanding.

Texas A&amp;M University offers a plan for an "Aging Simulation" workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Extension, "Aging Simulation: Sensitizing People to the Process of Aging" online at
http://fcs.tamu.edu/files/2015/06/aging-simulation.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The workshop is adapted from ''Sensitizing People to the Processes of Aging''.&lt;ref&gt;''Sensitizing People to the Processes of Aging: The In-Service Educator's Guide'' by Marvin Ernst and Herbert Shore, Dallas Geriatric Research Institute, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the simulations follow:
:* Sight: Wearing swimmer's goggles with black paper pasted to lens with only a small hole to simulate tunnel vision, 
:* Hearing: Use ear plugs to dull the sound of people talking. 
:* Touch: Wearing thick gloves, button a shirt or buckle a belt.
:* Dexterity: With tape around several fingers, unscrew a jar lid.
:* Mobility and Balance: Carry packages in one hand while using a walker.

The Macklin Intergenerational Institute conducts Xtreme Aging workshops, as depicted in ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/us/03aging.html|title=Simulating Age 85, With Lessons on Offering Care|date=3 August 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A condensed version was presented on

On set #1, write your 5 most enjoyed activities; on set #2, write your 5 most valued possessions; on set #3, write your 5 most loved people. Then "lose" them one by one, trying to feel each loss, until you have lost them all as happens in old age.

Most people in the age range of 60–80 (the years of retirement and early old age), enjoy rich possibilities for a full life, but the condition of [[Frailty syndrome|frailty]] distinguished by "bodily failure" and greater dependence becomes increasingly common after that.&lt;ref name="Tor Inge Romoren 2003"&gt;Tor Inge Romoren, ''Last Years of Long Lives: The Larvik Study'' (Routledge, 2003), 170.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, hospital discharge data from 2003 to 2011 shows that injury was the most common reason for hospitalization among patients aged 65+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Weiss AJ, Barrett ML, Andrews RM | title =  Trends and Projections of U.S. Hospital Costs by Payer, 2003–2013 | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #176 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = July 2014 | url = http://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb176-Hospital-Cost-Projections-by-Age-2013.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerontology|Gerontologists]] note the lack of research regarding and the difficulty in defining frailty. However, they add that physicians recognize frailty when they see it.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Burbank, editor, ''Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions'' (Springer, 2006), xxi, 4, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of [[Geriatrics|geriatricians]] proposed a general definition of frailty as "a physical state of increased vulnerability to stressors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/stressors |title=Stressors &amp;#124; definition of stressors by Medical dictionary |publisher=Medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; that results from decreased reserves and disregulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/dysregulation |title=Dysregulation Medical Definition &amp;#124; Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; in multiple physiological systems".&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Burbank, ed., ''Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions'' (Springer, 2006), 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevalence of frailty===
Frailty is a common condition in later old age 
but different definitions of frailty produce diverse assessments of prevalence. One study placed the incidence of frailty for ages 65+ at 10.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2012.04054.x|pmid=22881367|title=Prevalence of Frailty in Community-Dwelling Older Persons: A Systematic Review|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|volume=60|issue=8|pages=1487–92|year=2012|last1=Collard|first1=Rose M.|last2=Boter|first2=Han|last3=Schoevers|first3=Robert A.|last4=Oude Voshaar|first4=Richard C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study placed the incidence of frailty in age 65+ population at 22% for women and 15% for men.&lt;ref&gt;Muriel R. Gillick M.D., ''Choosing Medical Care in Old Age: What Kind, How Much, When to Stop'' (Harvard, 1998), 106.&lt;/ref&gt; A Canadian study illustrated how frailty increases with age and calculated the prevalence for 65+ as 22.4% and for 85+ as 43.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/741960 |title=Prevalence of Frailty Increases Throughout Adulthood |publisher=Medscape.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A worldwide study of "patterns of frailty" based on data from 20 nations found (a) a consistent correlation between frailty and age, (b) a higher frequency among women, and (c) more frailty in wealthier nations where greater support and medical care increases longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0075847|pmid=24204581|title=Patterns of Frailty in Older Adults: Comparing Results from Higher and Lower Income Countries Using the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and the Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health (SAGE)|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=8|issue=10|pages=e75847|year=2013|last1=Harttgen|first1=Kenneth|last2=Kowal|first2=Paul|last3=Strulik|first3=Holger|last4=Chatterji|first4=Somnath|last5=Vollmer|first5=Sebastian|bibcode=2013PLoSO...875847H|pmc=3812225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway, a 20-year longitudinal study of 400 people found that bodily failure and greater dependence became prevalent in the 80+ years. The study calls these years the "fourth age" or "old age in the real meaning of the term". Similarly, the "Berlin Aging Study" rated over-all functionality on four levels: good, medium, poor, and very poor. People in their 70s were mostly rated good. In the 80–90 year range, the four levels of functionality were divided equally. By the 90–100 year range, 60% would be considered frail because of very poor functionality and only 5% still possessed good functionality.&lt;ref name="Tor Inge Romoren 2003"/&gt;

In the United States, the 85+ age group is the fastest growing, a group that is almost sure to face the "inevitable decrepitude" of survivors.&lt;ref&gt;Colleen Johnson and Barbara M. Barer, ''Life Beyond 85 Years'' (Prometheus, 2003), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; (Frailty and decrepitude are synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesaurus.yourdictionary.com/frailty |title=Another word for frailty &amp;#124; Synonyms for frailty |publisher=Thesaurus.yourdictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Markers of frailty===
Three unique markers of frailty have been proposed: (a) loss of any notion of invincibility, (b) loss of ability to do things essential to one's care, and (c) loss of possibility for a subsequent life stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Nortin-M.-Hadler/e/B001ITYO36 |title=Nortin M. Hadler: Books, Biography, Blog, Audiobooks, Kindle |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old age survivors on-average deteriorate from agility in their 65–80s to a period of frailty preceding death. This deterioration is gradual for some and precipitous for others. Frailty is marked by an array of [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] physical and mental problems which means that frailty is not treatable as a specific disease. These problems coupled with increased dependency in the [[Basic activities of daily living|basic activities of daily living (ADLs)]] required for personal care add emotional problems: depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Muriel R. Gillick, ''Lifelines: Living Longer, Growing Frail, Taking Heart'' (Norton, 2001), x, xv–xvi, 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, frailty has been depicted as a group of "complex issues," distinct but "causally interconnected," that often include "comorbid diseases",&lt;ref&gt;"diseases in addition to the primary disease"&lt;/ref&gt; progressive weakness, stress, exhaustion, and depression.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Burbank, ed., ''Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions'' (Springer, 2006), 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misconceptions of frail people===
Johnson and Barer did a pioneering study of  ''Life Beyond 85 Years'' by interviews over a six-year period. In talking with 85-year-olds and older, they found some popular conceptions about old age to be erroneous. Such erroneous conceptions include (1) people in old age have at least one family member for support, (2) old age well-being requires social activity, and (3) "successful adaptation" to age-related changes demands a continuity of self-concept. In their interviews, Johnson and Barer found that 24% of the 85+ had no face-to-face family relationships; many have outlived their families. Second, that contrary to popular notions, the interviews revealed that the reduced activity and socializing of the over-85s does not harm their well-being; they "welcome increased detachment". Third, rather than a continuity of self-concept, as the interviewees faced new situations they changed their "cognitive and emotional processes" and reconstituted their "self–representation".&lt;ref&gt;Colleen Johnson and Barbara M. Barer, ''Life Beyond 85 Years'' (Prometheus, 2003), 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Care and costs===
[[File:Altenpflege 02.jpg|thumb|upright|The hand of an elderly person]]
Frail people require a high level of care. Medical advances have made it possible to "postpone death" for years. This added time costs many frail people "prolonged sickness, dependence, pain, and suffering".&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Burbank, editor, ''Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions'' (Springer, 2006), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the rate of emergency department visits was consistently highest among patients ages 85 years and older in 2006–2011 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Skiner HG, Blanchard J, Elixhauser A | title =  Trends in Emergency Department Visits, 2006–2011 | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #179 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = September 2014 | url = https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb179-Emergency-Department-Trends.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, patients aged 65+ had the highest percentage of hospital stays for adults with multiple chronic conditions but the second highest percentage of hospital costs in 2003–2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Steiner CA, Barett ML, Weiss AJ, Andrews RM | title =  Trends and Projections in Hospital Stays for Adults With Multiple Chronic Conditions, 2003–2014 | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #183 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = November 2014 | url =https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb183-Hospitalizations-Multiple-Chronic-Conditions-Projections-2014.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These final years are also costly in economic terms.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Logue 1994, ''Last Rights: Death Control and the Elderly in America'' (Lexington Books/Macmillan, 1993), 17–18, 92.&lt;/ref&gt; One out of every four Medicare dollars is spent on the frail in their last year of life . . . in attempts to postpone death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Penelope Wang |url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/11/pf/end-of-life-care-duplicate-2.moneymag/ |title=Cutting the High Cost of End-of-Life Care &amp;#124; TIME |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2012-12-12 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical treatments in the final days are not only economically costly, they are often unnecessary, even harmful.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Wang, "Cutting the high cost of end-of-life care" (CNNMoney, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Nortin Hadler, M.D. warns against the tendency to medicalize and overtreat the frail.&lt;ref&gt;Nortin M. Hadler, ''Rethinking Aging: Growing Old and Living Well in an Overtreated Society'' (University of North Carolina, 2011) 1, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In her ''Choosing Medical Care in Old Age'', Michael R. Gillick M.D. argues that appropriate medical treatment for the frail is not the same as for the robust. The frail are vulnerable to "being tipped over" by any physical stress put on the system such as medical interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Muriel R. Gillick M.D., ''Choosing Medical Care in Old Age: What Kind, How Much, When to Stop'' (Harvard, 1998), 116, 189,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and frailty===
Old age, death, and frailty are linked because approximately half the deaths in old age are preceded by months or years of frailty.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Burbank, ed., ''Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions'' (Springer, 2006), 3, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Older Adults' Views on Death'' is based on interviews with 109 people in the 70–90 age range, with a mean age of 80.7. 
Almost 20% of the people wanted to use whatever treatment that might postpone death. About the same number said that, given a terminal illness, they would choose assisted suicide. Roughly half chose doing nothing except live day by day until death comes naturally without medical or other intervention designed to prolong life. This choice was coupled with a desire to receive palliative care if needed.&lt;ref&gt;Victor G. Cicirelli, ''Older Adults' Views on Death'' (Springer, 2002), 6–7, 9, 12, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

About half of older adults suffer multimorbidity, that is, they have three or more chronic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/geriatric_medicine_gerontology/aging_research/health_services_research/multimorbidity.html |title=Multimorbidity &amp;#124; Johns Hopkins Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology |publisher=Hopkinsmedicine.org |date=2011-06-24 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical advances have made it possible to "postpone death," but in many cases this postponement adds "prolonged sickness, dependence, pain, and suffering," a time that is costly in social, psychological, and economic terms.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Logue, ''Last Rights: Death Control and the Elderly in America'' (Lexington Books/Macmillan, 1993), 18, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The longitudinal interviews of 150 age 85+ people summarized in ''Life Beyond 85 Years'' found "progressive terminal decline" in the year prior to death: constant fatigue, much sleep, detachment from people, things, and activities, simplified lives. Most of the interviewees did not fear death; some would welcome it. One person said, "Living this long is pure hell."
However, nearly everyone feared a long process of dying. Some wanted to die in their sleep; others wanted to die "on their feet".&lt;ref&gt;Colleen Johnson and Barbara M. Barer, ''Life Beyond 85 Years'' (Prometheus, 2003), 202–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of  ''Older Adults' Views on Death'' found that the more frail people were, the more "pain, suffering, and struggles" they were enduring, the more likely they were to "accept and welcome" death as a release from their misery. Their fear about the process of dying was that it would prolong their distress. Besides being a release from misery, some saw death as a way to reunion with departed loved ones. Others saw death as a way to free their caretakers from the burden of their care.&lt;ref&gt;Victor G. Cicirelli, ''Older Adults' Views on Death'' (Springer, 2002) 55, 270, 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religiosity in old age==
Generally speaking, old people have always been more religious than young people.&lt;ref&gt;https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10036/57193/Davie%20Progress%20Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, wide cultural variations exist.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 608.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the United States, 90% of old age Hispanics view themselves as very, quite, or somewhat religious.&lt;ref name="Melvin A. Kimble 1995"&gt;Melvin A. Kimble, Susan H. McFadden, James W. Ellor, eds.,''Aging, Spirituality, and Religion: A Handbook'', Vol 1 (Fortress, 1995), 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pew Research Center's study of black and white old people found that 62% of those in ages 65–74 and 70% in ages 75+ asserted that religion was "very important" to them. For all 65+ people, more women (76%) than men (53%) and more blacks (87%) than whites (63%) consider religion "very important" to them. This compares to 54% in the 30–49 age range.&lt;ref name="pewsocialtrends1"&gt;http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2010/10/Getting-Old-in-America.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In a British 20-year longitudinal study, less than half of the old people surveyed said that religion was "very important" to them, and a quarter said they had become less religious in old age.&lt;ref&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010). 608.&lt;/ref&gt; The late-life rise in religiosity is stronger in Japan than in the United States, but in the Netherlands it is minimal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

In the practice of religion, a study of 60+ people found that 25% read the Bible every day and over 40% look at religious TV.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin A. Kimble, Susan H. McFadden, James W. Ellor, eds.,''Aging, Spirituality, and Religion: A Handbook'', Vol 1 (Fortress, 1995), 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Pew Research found that in the age 65+ range, 75% of whites and 87% of blacks pray daily.&lt;ref name="pewsocialtrends1"/&gt;

Participation in organized religion is not a good indicator of religiosity because transportation and health problems often hinder participation.&lt;ref name="Melvin A. Kimble 1995"/&gt;

==Demographic changes==
In the industrialized countries, life expectancy and, thus, the old age population have increased consistently over the last decades.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus08.pdf#026 |title=Table 26: Life expectancy at birth, at 65 years of age, and at 75 years of age by race and sex: United States, selected years, 1900 – 2005|date= |work= |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States the proportion of people aged 65 or older increased from 4% in 1900 to about 12% in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/c2kbr01-12.pdf|title=Census 2000 Brief, C2KBR/01-12, U.S.|publisher="Census Bureau"|location="Washington, DC"|accessdate=2009-03-17|last=Meyer|first=Julie|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, only about {{Nowrap|3 million}} of the nation's citizens were 65 or older (out of 76 million total American citizens). By 2000, the number of senior citizens had increased to about 35 million (of 280 million US citizens). Population experts estimate that more than {{Nowrap|50 million}} Americans—about 17 percent of the population—will be 65 or older in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agingstats.gov/Main_Site/Data/2012_Documents/Population.aspx |title=Older Americans 2012: Key Indicators of Well-Being |publisher=Agingstats.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313055028/http://agingstats.gov/main_site/data/2012_documents/population.aspx |archivedate=2016-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2050, it is projected that at least 400,000 Americans will be 100 or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans' Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension &amp;#124; Pew Research Center |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=2013-08-06 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of old people is growing around the world chiefly because of the [[post–World War II baby boom]] and increases in the provision and standards of health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/worldageing19502050/ |title=World Population Ageing |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2050, 33% of the developed world's population and almost 20% of the less developed world's population will be over 60 years old.&lt;ref&gt;John Bond and others, editors, ''Ageing in Society'' (Sage, 2007 3rd ed), 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing number of people living to their 80s and 90s in the developed world has strained public welfare systems and has also resulted in increased incidence of diseases like cancer and dementia that were rarely seen in premodern times. When the United States Social Security program was created, persons older than 65 numbered only around 5% of the population and the average life expectancy of a 65-year-old in 1936 was approximately 5 years, while in 2011 it could often range from 10 to 20 years. Other issues that can arise from an increasing population are growing demands for health care and an increase in demand for different types of services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v66n1/v66n1p1.html |title=Social Security: A Program and Policy History |publisher=Ssa.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2202/1941-6008.1011|title=Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations|journal=Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology|volume=1|year=2007|last1=De Grey|first1=Aubrey D.N.J}}&lt;/ref&gt; In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/&gt;

==Psychosocial aspects==
[[File:BuddhistMonk02.jpg|thumb|upright|An elderly [[Khmer people|Khmer]] woman]]
According to [[Erik Erikson]]'s [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|"Stages of Psychosocial Development"]], the human personality is developed in a series of eight stages that take place from the time of birth and continue on throughout an individual's complete life. He characterises old age as a period of "Integrity vs. Despair", during which a person focuses on reflecting back on his life. Those who are unsuccessful during this phase will feel that their life has been wasted and will experience many regrets. The individual will be left with feelings of bitterness and despair. Those who feel proud of their accomplishments will feel a sense of integrity. Successfully completing this phase means looking back with few regrets and a general feeling of satisfaction. These individuals will attain wisdom, even when confronting death.&lt;ref&gt;Erikson, E.H. (1968). ''Identity: Youth and Crisis''. New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erikson, E.H. (1963).

For people in their 80s and 90s, [[Joan Erikson]] added a ninth stage in ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version''.&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; As she wrote, she added the ninth stage because the Integrity of the eighth stage imposes "a serious demand on the senses of elders" and the Wisdom of the eighth stage requires capacities that ninth stage elders "do not usually have".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newman &amp; Newman also proposed a ninth stage of life, Elderhood. Elderhood refers to those individuals who live past the life expectancy of their birth cohorts. There are two different types of people described in this stage of life.  The "young old" are the healthy individuals who can function on their own without assistance and can complete their daily tasks independently. The "old old" are those who depend on specific services due to declining health or diseases. This period of life is characterized as a period of "immortality vs. extinction". Immortality is the belief that your life will go on past death, some examples are an afterlife or living on through one's family. Extinction refers to feeling as if life has no purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara M. Newman, Philip R. Newman, ''Development Through Life: A Psychosocial Approach: A Psychosocial Approach'' (Cengage Learning, 2011), Ch 13 "Later Adulthood (60–75 Years)" and Ch 14, "Elderhood (75 until death)".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories of old age===
[[File:Habibaadansalat.jpg|thumb|An elderly [[Somali people|Somali]] woman]]
[[File:Walking style of an aged woman on road.jpg|thumb|An elderly woman walks down a road]]
Social theories, or concepts,&lt;ref&gt;"Theory: A conception . . . of something to be done, or of the method of doing it." ''Oxford English Dictionary Online ''. December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; propose explanations for the distinctive relationships between old people and their societies.

One of the theories is the [[disengagement theory]] proposed in 1961. This theory proposes that in old age a mutual disengagement between people and their society occurs in anticipation of death. By becoming disengaged from work and family responsibilities, according to this concept, people are enabled to enjoy their old age without stress.
This theory has been subjected to the criticism that old age disengagement is neither natural, inevitable, nor beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciences360.com/index.php/an-overview-of-cumming-and-henrys-social-disengagement-theory-3750/&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, disengaging from social ties in old age is not across the board: unsatisfactory ties are dropped and satisfying ones kept.&lt;ref&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 613.&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition to the disengagement theory, the [[activity theory (aging)|activity theory]] of old age argues that disengagement in old age occurs not by desire, but by the barriers to social engagement imposed by society. This theory has been faulted for not factoring in psychological changes that occur in old age as shown by reduced activity, even when available. It has also been found that happiness in old age is not proportional to activity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 614.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[continuity theory]], in spite of the inevitable differences imposed by their old age, most people try to maintain continuity in personhood, activities, and relationships with their younger days.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Socioemotional selectivity theory]] also depicts how people maintain continuity in old age. The focus of this theory is continuity sustained by social networks, albeit networks narrowed by choice and by circumstances. The choice is for more harmonious relationships. The circumstances are loss of relationships by death and distance.&lt;ref&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 614–615.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life expectancy==
[[Life expectancy]] by nation at birth in the year 2011 ranged from 48 years to 82. Low values indicate high death rates for infants and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/2.21 |title=World Development Indicators &amp;#124; The World Bank |publisher=Wdi.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most parts of the world women live, on average, longer than men; even so, the disparities vary between 12 years in Russia to no difference or higher life expectancy for men in countries such as Zimbabwe and Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;de Blij, Harm. The power of place. Geography, Destiny, and Globalization's Rough Landscape. [[Oxford University Press]]. London:2009. p161ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of elderly persons worldwide began to surge in the second half of the 20th century. Up to that time (and still true in underdeveloped countries), five or less percent of the population was over 65. Few lived longer than their 70s and people who attained advanced age (i.e. their 80s) were rare enough to be a novelty and were revered as wise sages. The worldwide over-65 population in 1960 was one-third of the under 5 population. By 2013, the over-65 population had grown to equal the under 5 population. The over-65 population is projected to double the under five by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/ageing/publications/global_health.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the surge in the over-65 population, accidents and disease claimed many people before they could attain old age, and health problems in those over 65 meant a quick death in most cases. If a person lived to an advanced age, it was due to genetic factors and/or a relatively easy lifestyle, since diseases of old age could not be treated before the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/whr/2004/annex/topic/en/annex_2_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, scientists identified the maximum [[Ageing|human lifespan]] at an average age of 115, with an absolute upper limit of 125 years.&lt;ref name="NAT-20151005"/&gt; However, the concept of a maximum lifespan in humans is still widely debated among the scientific community.&lt;ref name="NYT-20161005"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=What's the Longest Humans Can Live? 115 Years, New Study Says |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/science/maximum-life-span-study.html |date=October 5, 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=October 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old age benefits==
German chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] created the world's first comprehensive government [[social safety net]] in the 1880s, providing for old age pensions.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

In the [[Social Security (United States)|United States of America]], and the [[Pensions in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], 65 (UK 60 for women) was traditionally the age of retirement with full old age benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Old-Age+Benefits |title=Old-Age Benefits legal definition of Old-Age Benefits |publisher=Legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date=2013-05-23 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thisismoney1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/pensions/article-1679780/New-state-pension-age-retire.html |title=New state pension age: when will you retire? |publisher=This is Money |date=2016-03-10 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the age at which a United States citizen became eligible for full Social Security benefits began to increase gradually, and will continue to do so until it reaches 67 in 2027. Full retirement age for Social Security benefits for people retiring in 2012 is age 66.&lt;ref name="socialsecurity.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/retirechart.htm |title=Age To Receive Full Social Security Retirement Benefits|date= |work= |publisher=[[Social Security Administration|U.S. Social SecurityAdministration]]|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the state pension age for men and women will rise to 66 in 2020 with further increases scheduled after that."&lt;ref name="thisismoney1"/&gt;

Originally, the purpose of old age pensions was to prevent elderly persons from being reduced to beggary, which is still common in some underdeveloped countries, but growing life expectancies and older populations have brought into question the model under which pension systems were designed.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Schulz and Robert H. Binstock, Aging Nation: The Economics and Politics of Growing Older in America (Johns Hopkins, 2008). 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990, the United States was spending 30 per cent of its budget on the elderly, compared with 2 per cent on education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = U.S. spending|date = April 19, 1990|work = [[Rolling Stone]]|access-date = |via = |page = 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant perception of the American old age population changed from "needy" and "worthy" to "powerful" and "greedy," old people getting more than their share of the nation's resources.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Katz Olson, ''The Not-so-golden Years: Caregiving, the Frail Elderly, and the Long-term Care Establishment'' (Rowman and Littlefield, 2003), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2011, using a Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), the old age American poverty rate was measured as 15.9%.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

==Assistance: devices and personal==
[[File:Nursing home.JPG|thumb|Old man at a [[nursing home]] in [[Norway]]]]
In the United States in 2008, 11 million people aged 65+ lived alone: 5 million or 22% of ages 65–74, 4 million or 34% of ages 75–84, and 2 million or 41% of ages 85+. The 2007 gender breakdown for all people 65+ was men 19% and women 39%.&lt;ref&gt;http://longevity3.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/New-Realities-of-an-Older-America.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Many new assistive devices made especially for the home have enabled more old people to care for themselves [[activities of daily living]] (ADL). Able Data&lt;ref&gt;Maintained for the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research of the U.S. Dept. of Education.&lt;/ref&gt; lists 40,000 assistive technology products in 20 categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abledata.com/abledata.cfm?pageid=19327&amp;ksectionid=19327 |title=Welcome to |publisher=AbleData |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of devices are a medical alert and safety system, shower seat (making it so the person does not get tired in the shower and fall), a bed cane (offering support to those with unsteadiness getting in and out of bed) and an ADL cuff (used with eating utensils for people with paralysis or hand weakness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/elderly/english/healthinfo/elderly/assistivedevices-e.htm |title=Elderly Health Service |accessdate=December 30, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831094556/http://www.info.gov.hk/elderly/english/healthinfo/elderly/assistivedevices-e.htm |archivedate=August 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Swedish study found that at age 76, 46% of the subjects used assistive devices. When they reached age 86, 69% used them. The subjects were ambivalent regarding the use of the assistive devices: as "enablers" or as "disablers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Use of assistive devices – a reality full of contradictions in elderly persons' everyday life|first1=Greta|last1=Häggblom-Kronlöf|first2=Ulla|last2=Sonn|date=1 January 2007|volume=2|issue=6|pages=335–345|doi=10.1080/17483100701701672|journal=[[Disability and Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who view assistive devices as enabling greater independence accept and use them. Those who see them as symbols of disability reject them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homemods.org/resources/pages/accept.shtml |title=Home Modifications |publisher=Homemods.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[organization]]s like [[Love for the Elderly]] aim to combat such age-related prejudice by educating the public about the importance of appreciating growing older, while also providing services of kindness to elders in senior homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lovefortheelderly.org/|title=Love for the Elderly|website=Love for the Elderly|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with assistive devices as of 2006, 8.5 million Americans needed personal assistance because of impaired [[basic activities of daily living]] required for personal care or impaired [[instrumental activities of daily living]] (IADL) required for independent living. Projections place this number at 21 million by 2030 when 40% of Americans over 70 will need assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Burbank, editor, ''Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions'' (Springer, 2006), 17.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many options for such long term care to those who require it. There is [[home care]] in which a family member, volunteer, or trained professional will aid the person in need and help with daily activities. Another option is community services which can provide the person with transportation, meal plans, or activities in [[senior centers]]. A third option is [[assisted living]] where 24-hour round-the-clock supervision is given with aid in eating, bathing, dressing, etc. A final option is a [[nursing home]] which provides professional nursing care.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/44363-LTC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orbital perturbation analysis''' is the activity of determining why a [[satellite|satellite's]] orbit differs from the mathematical ideal orbit.  A satellite's [[Kepler orbit|orbit]] in an ideal two-body system describes a conic section, usually an ellipse.  In reality, there are several factors that cause the conic section to continually change.  These deviations from the ideal Kepler's orbit are called [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]].

==History, for example, of the lunar orbit==
It has long been recognized that the [[Lunar theory|Moon]] does not follow a perfect orbit, and many theories and models have been examined over the millennia to explain it. [[Isaac Newton]] determined the primary contributing factor to orbital perturbation of the moon was that the shape of the Earth is actually an [[oblate spheroid]] due to its spin, and he used the perturbations of the lunar orbit to estimate the oblateness of the Earth.{{dubious|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In Newton's [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]], he demonstrated that the gravitational force between two mass points is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the points, and he fully solved the corresponding [[Kepler orbit|"two-body problem"]] demonstrating that the radius vector between the two points would describe an ellipse. But no exact closed analytical form could be found for the [[three-body problem]].  Instead, mathematical models called "orbital perturbation analysis" have been developed. With these techniques a quite accurate mathematical description of the trajectories of all the planets could be obtained.  Newton recognized that the Moon's perturbations could not entirely be accounted for using just the solution to the three-body problem, as the deviations from a pure Kepler orbit around the Earth are much larger than deviations of the orbits of the planets from their own Sun-centered Kepler orbits, caused by the gravitational attraction between the planets. With the availability of digital computers and the ease with which we can now compute orbits, this problem has partly disappeared, as the motion of all celestial bodies including planets, satellites, asteroids and comets can be modeled and predicted with almost perfect accuracy using the method of the numerical propagation of the trajectories. Nevertheless, several analytical closed form expressions for the effect of such additional "perturbing forces" are still very useful.

The precise modeling of the motion of the Moon has been a difficult task. The best and most accurate modeling for the lunar orbit before the availability of digital computers was obtained with the complicated [[Charles-Eugène Delaunay|Delaunay]] and [[Ernest William Brown|Brown]]'s [[lunar theory|lunar theories]].

==In general==
All celestial bodies of the [[Solar System]] follow in first approximation a [[Kepler orbit]] around a central body. For a satellite (artificial or natural) this central body is a planet. But both due to gravitational forces caused by the Sun and other celestial bodies and due to the flattening of its planet (caused by its rotation which makes the planet slightly oblate and therefore the result of the [[Shell theorem]] not fully applicable) the satellite will follow an orbit around the Earth that deviates more than the Kepler orbits observed for the planets.

==Perturbation of spacecraft orbits==
For man-made spacecraft orbiting the Earth at comparatively low altitudes the deviations from a Kepler orbit are much larger than for the Moon. The approximation of the gravitational force of the Earth to be that of a homogeneous sphere gets worse the closer one gets to the Earth surface and the majority of the artificial Earth satellites are in orbits that are only a few hundred kilometers over the Earth surface.  Furthermore, they are (as opposed to the Moon) significantly affected by the [[solar radiation pressure]] because of their large cross-section-to-mass ratio; this applies in particular to [[3-axis stabilized spacecraft]] with large [[solar arrays]] and is allowed for in calculation of [[graveyard orbit]]s. In addition they are significantly affected by rarefied air below 800–1000&amp;nbsp;km. The air drag at high altitudes is also dependent on [[Space weather|solar activity]].

==Mathematical approach==

Consider any function 
:&lt;math&gt;g(x_1,x_2,x_3,v_1,v_2,v_3)\,&lt;/math&gt;

of the position
:&lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,x_3\,&lt;/math&gt;

and the velocity
:&lt;math&gt;v_1,v_2,v_3\,&lt;/math&gt;

From the chain rule of differentiation one gets that the time derivative of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{g}\ =\ \frac{\partial g }{\partial x_1}\ v_1\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial x_2}\ v_2\ + \frac{\partial g }{\partial x_3}\ v_3\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_1}\ f_1\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_2}\ f_2\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_3}\ f_3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f_1\ ,\ f_2\ ,\ f_3&lt;/math&gt; are the components of the force per unit mass acting on the body.

If now &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is a "constant of motion" for a [[Kepler orbit]] like for example an [[orbital element]] and the force is corresponding "Kepler force"
:&lt;math&gt;
(f_1\ ,\ f_2\ ,\ f_3)\  = \ - \frac {\mu} {r^3}\ (x_1\ ,\ x_2\ ,\ x_3)
&lt;/math&gt;
one has that &lt;math&gt;\dot{g}\ =\ 0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

If the force is the sum of the "Kepler force" and an additional force (force per unit mass)

:&lt;math&gt;(h_1\ ,\ h_2\ ,\ h_3)&lt;/math&gt;

i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;
(f_1\ ,\ f_2\ ,\ f_3)\  = \ - \frac {\mu} {r^3}\ (x_1\ ,\ x_2\ ,\ x_3)\ +\ (h_1\ ,\ h_2\ ,\ h_3)
&lt;/math&gt;

one therefore has

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{g}\ =\frac{\partial g }{\partial v_1}\ h_1\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_2}\ h_2\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_3}\ h_3&lt;/math&gt;

and that the change of &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt; in the time from &lt;math&gt;t=t_1\,&lt;/math&gt; to  &lt;math&gt;t=t_2\,&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta g\ =\ \int\limits_{t_1}^{t_2}\left(\frac{\partial g }{\partial v_1}\ h_1\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_2}\ h_2\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_3}\ h_3 \right)dt
&lt;/math&gt;

If now the additional force &lt;math&gt;(h_1\ ,\ h_2\ ,\ h_3)\,&lt;/math&gt; is sufficiently small that the motion will be close to that of a [[Kepler orbit]] one gets an approximate value for &lt;math&gt;\Delta g\,&lt;/math&gt; by evaluating this integral assuming 
&lt;math&gt;x_1(t),x_2(t),x_3(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; to precisely follow this [[Kepler orbit]].

In general one wants to find an approximate expression for the change  &lt;math&gt;\Delta g\,&lt;/math&gt; over one orbital revolution using the true anomaly &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt; as integration variable, i.e. as

\Delta g\ =\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left(\frac{\partial g }{\partial v_1}\ h_1\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_2}\ h_2\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_3}\ h_3 \right)\frac{r^2}{\sqrt{\mu p}}d\theta
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

This integral is evaluated setting &lt;math&gt;r(\theta)=\frac {p}{1+e\cos \theta}\,&lt;/math&gt;, the elliptical Kepler orbit in polar angles.
For the transformation of integration variable from time to [[true anomaly]] it was used that the angular momentum &lt;math&gt;H\ =\ r^2\ \dot{\theta}\ =\ \sqrt{\mu p} \,&lt;/math&gt; by definition of the parameter &lt;math&gt;p\,&lt;/math&gt; for a Kepler orbit (see equation (13) of the [[Kepler orbit]] article).

For the special case where the Kepler orbit is circular or almost circular
:&lt;math&gt;r\ =\ p&lt;/math&gt; and ({{EquationNote|1}}) takes the simpler form
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta g\ =\ \frac{P}{2\pi}\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left(\frac{\partial g }{\partial v_1}\ h_1\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_2}\ h_2\ + \ \frac{\partial g }{\partial v_3}\ h_3 \right)d\theta
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;P\ =\ 2\pi\ r\ \sqrt{\frac{r}{\mu}}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the orbital period

===Perturbation of the semi-major axis/orbital period===

For an elliptic [[Kepler orbit]], the sum of the kinetic and the potential energy

:&lt;math&gt;g = \frac{V^2}{2}-\frac {\mu} {r}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt; is the orbital velocity, is a constant and equal to

:&lt;math&gt;g\ =\ -\frac {\mu} {2 \cdot a}&lt;/math&gt; (Equation ([[Kepler orbit#equation 44|44]]) of the Kepler orbit article)

If &lt;math&gt;\bar{h}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the perturbing force and &lt;math&gt;\bar{V}\,&lt;/math&gt;is the velocity vector of the Kepler orbit the equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) takes the form:

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta g\ =\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\bar{V} \bar{h}\frac{r^2}{\sqrt{\mu p}}d\theta
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

and for a circular or almost circular orbit

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta g\ =\ \frac{P}{2\pi}\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \bar{V} \bar{h}d\theta
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

From the change &lt;math&gt;\Delta g\,&lt;/math&gt; of the parameter &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt; the new semi-major axis &lt;math&gt;a\,&lt;/math&gt; and the new period &lt;math&gt;P\ =\ 2\pi\ a\ \sqrt{\frac{a}{\mu}}\,&lt;/math&gt; are computed (relations (43) and (44) of the [[Kepler orbit]] article).

===Perturbation of the orbital plane===

Let &lt;math&gt;\hat{g}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{h}\,&lt;/math&gt; make up a rectangular coordinate system in the plane of the reference Kepler orbit. If &lt;math&gt;\omega\,&lt;/math&gt; is the argument of perigee relative the &lt;math&gt;\hat{g}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{h}\,&lt;/math&gt; coordinate system the true anomaly &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;\theta=u-\omega\,&lt;/math&gt; and the approximate change &lt;math&gt; \Delta \hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt; of the orbital pole &lt;math&gt; \hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt; (defined as the unit vector in the direction of the angular momentum) is
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \hat{z}\ =\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{f_z }{V_t} (\hat{g} \cos u  + \hat{h} \sin u)\frac{r^2}{\sqrt{\mu p}}du \quad \times \ \hat{z}
=\ \frac{1}{\mu p}\left[\hat{g}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}f_z r^3 \cos u \ du
+\ \hat{h}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}f_z r^3 \sin u \ du \right]\quad \times \ \hat{z}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;f_z\,&lt;/math&gt; is the component of the perturbing force in the &lt;math&gt; \hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt; direction, &lt;math&gt;V_t=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{p}}\ (1+e\ \cos\theta)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity component of the Kepler orbit orthogonal to radius vector and &lt;math&gt;r=\frac{p}{1+e\ \cos\theta}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the distance to the center of the Earth.
 
For a circular or almost circular orbit ({{EquationNote|5}}) simplifies to

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \hat{z}\ =\ \frac{r^2}{\mu}\left[\hat{g}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}f_z \cos u \ du
+\ \hat{h}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}f_z \sin u \ du \right]\quad \times \ \hat{z}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

'''Example'''

In a circular orbit a low-force propulsion system ([[Ion thruster]]) generates a thrust (force per unit mass) of &lt;math&gt;F\  \hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of the orbital pole in the half of the orbit for which &lt;math&gt;\sin u\,&lt;/math&gt; is positive and in the opposite direction in the other half. The resulting change of orbit pole after one orbital revolution of duration &lt;math&gt;P\ =\ 2\pi\ r\ \sqrt{\frac{r}{\mu}}\,&lt;/math&gt; is

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \hat{z}\ =\ \frac{r^2}{\mu}\left[\ 2\ F\int\limits_{0}^{\pi}\sin u \ du \right]\quad \hat{h}\times \hat{z} =
\ \frac{r^2}{\mu}\ 4\ F\ \quad \hat{g}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

The average change rate &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta \hat{z}}{P}\,&lt;/math&gt; is therefore

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\Delta \hat{z}}{P} =\ \frac{2}{\pi}\ \frac{F}{V}\ \hat{g}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|8}}}}
where &lt;math&gt;V\ =\ \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{r}},&lt;/math&gt; is the orbital velocity in the circular Kepler orbit.

===Perturbation of the eccentricity vector===

Rather than applying (1) and (2) on the partial derivatives of the orbital elements '''eccentricity''' and '''argument of perigee''' directly one should apply these relations for the [[eccentricity vector]]. First of all the typical application is a near-circular orbit. But there are also mathematical advantages working with the partial derivatives of the components of this vector also for orbits with a significant eccentricity.

Equations (60), (55) and (52) of the [[Kepler orbit]] article say that the eccentricity vector is
 
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\bar{e}=\frac{(V_t-V_0) \cdot \hat{r} - V_r \cdot \hat{t}}{V_0}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}

where

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;V_0 = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{p}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|10}}}}
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{{(r \cdot V_t)}^2}{\mu }&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|11}}}}

from which follows that

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\bar{e}}{\partial V_r} = -\frac {1}{V_0} \hat{t}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|12}}}}
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\bar{e}}{\partial V_t} = \frac {1}{V_0} \left(2\ \hat{r}-\frac{V_r}{V_t}\ \hat{t}\right)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|13}}}}

where

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;V_r = \sqrt{\frac {\mu}{p}} \cdot e \cdot \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|14}}}}
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;V_t = \sqrt{\frac {\mu}{p}} \cdot (1 + e \cdot \cos \theta)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|15}}}}

(Equations (18) and (19) of the [[Kepler orbit]] article)

The eccentricity vector is by definition always in the [[Osculating orbit|osculating]] orbital plane spanned by &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{t}&lt;/math&gt; and formally there is also a derivative 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\bar{e}}{\partial V_z} = -\frac {V_r}{V_0}\  \frac{\partial\hat{t}}{\partial V_z}&lt;/math&gt;

with
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\hat{t}}{\partial V_z} =  \frac {1}{V_t}\ \hat{z}&lt;/math&gt;

corresponding to the rotation of the orbital plane

But in practice the in-plane change of the eccentricity vector is computed as

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Delta \bar{e}\ = &amp;\frac {1}{V_0}\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left(-\hat{t}\ f_r\ + \ \left(2\ \hat{r}-\frac{V_r}{V_t}\ \hat{t}\right)\ f_t\right)\frac{r^2}{\sqrt{\mu p}}du\ = \\
&amp;\frac {1}{\mu}\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left(-\hat{t}\ f_r\ + \ \left(2\ \hat{r}-\frac{V_r}{V_t}\ \hat{t}\right)\ f_t\right) r^2 du \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|16}}}}

ignoring the out-of-plane force and the new eccentricity vector 
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{e} + \Delta \bar{e}&lt;/math&gt;
is subsequently projected to the new orbital plane orthogonal to the new orbit normal
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{z} + \Delta \hat{z}&lt;/math&gt;
computed as described above.

'''Example'''

The Sun is in the orbital plane of a spacecraft in a circular orbit with radius &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; and consequently with a constant orbital velocity &lt;math&gt;V_0\ =\ \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{r}}&lt;/math&gt; . If &lt;math&gt;\hat{k}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{l}\,&lt;/math&gt; make up a rectangular coordinate system in the orbital plane such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{k}\,&lt;/math&gt; points to the Sun and assuming that the solar radiation pressure force per unit mass &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; is constant  one gets that 
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{r}=\cos(u)\ \hat{k}\ +\ \sin(u)\ \hat{l}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{t}=-\sin(u)\ \hat{k}\ +\ \cos(u)\ \hat{l}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_r=-\cos(u)\ F\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_t= \sin(u)\ F\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u\,&lt;/math&gt; is the polar angle of &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;\hat{k}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{l}\,&lt;/math&gt; system. Applying ({{EquationNote|2}}) one gets that

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Delta \hat{e}\ &amp; =\ \frac{P}{2\pi}\ \frac {1}{V_0}\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left( (-\sin(u)\ \hat{k}\ +\ \cos(u)\ \hat{l}) \ F\  \cos(u)\ + \ 2\ (\cos(u)\ \hat{k}\ +\ \sin(u)\ \hat{l})\ F\ \sin(u)\right)\ du \\
&amp; = P\ \frac{3}{2}\ \frac {1}{V_0}\ \ F\ \hat{l} 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|17}}}}

This means the eccentricity vector will gradually increase in the direction &lt;math&gt;\hat{l}\,&lt;/math&gt; orthogonal to the Sun direction. This is true for any orbit with a small eccentricity, the direction of the small eccentricity vector does not matter.  As &lt;math&gt;P\,&lt;/math&gt; is the orbital period this means that the average rate of this increase will be 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{2}\ \frac {F}{V_0}\,&lt;/math&gt;

==The effect of the Earth flattening==
[[File:Spherical coordinates unit vectors.svg|thumb|right|Figure 1: The unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat{\phi}\ ,\ \hat{\lambda}\ ,\ \hat{r}&lt;/math&gt;]]
In the article [[Geopotential model]] the modeling of the gravitational field as a sum of spherical harmonics is discussed. By far, the dominating term is the "J2-term". This is a "zonal term" and corresponding force is therefore completely in a longitudinal plane with one component &lt;math&gt;F_r\ \hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; in the radial direction and one component &lt;math&gt;F_\lambda\ \hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt;  with the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt; orthogonal to the radial direction towards north. These directions &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt; are illustrated in Figure 1.

[[File:Zonal term force components.svg|thumb|right|Figure 2: The unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{t}\,&lt;/math&gt; orthogonal to &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of motion and the orbital pole &lt;math&gt;\hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt;. The force component &lt;math&gt;F_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is marked as "F"]]

To be able to apply relations derived in the previous section the force component &lt;math&gt;F_\lambda\ \hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt; must be split into two orthogonal components &lt;math&gt;F_t\ \hat{t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_z\ \hat{z}&lt;/math&gt; as illustrated in figure 2

Let &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}\ ,\ \hat{b}\ ,\ \hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; make up a rectangular coordinate system with origin in the center of the Earth (in the center of the [[Reference ellipsoid]])  such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; points in the direction north and such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}\ ,\ \hat{b}\,&lt;/math&gt; are in the equatorial plane of the Earth with &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}\,&lt;/math&gt; pointing towards the [[Orbital node|ascending node]], i.e. towards the blue point of Figure 2.

The components of the unit vectors
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\ ,\ \hat{t}\ ,\ \hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt;

making up the local coordinate system (of which &lt;math&gt;\hat{t}\ ,\ \hat{z},&lt;/math&gt; are illustrated in figure 2) relative the &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}\ ,\ \hat{b}\ ,\ \hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; are

:&lt;math&gt;r_a= \cos u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_b= \cos i \ \sin u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_n= \sin i \ \sin u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t_a=-\sin u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t_b= \cos i \ \cos u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t_n= \sin i \ \cos u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_a= 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_b=-\sin i\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_n= \cos i\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u\,&lt;/math&gt; is the polar argument of &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; relative the orthogonal unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat{g}=\hat{a}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{h}=\cos i\ \hat{b}\ +\ \sin i\ \hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; in the orbital plane

Firstly

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \lambda =\ r_n\ =\ \sin i \ \sin u\,&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;\lambda\,&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the equator plane and &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; (between the green points of figure 2) and from equation (12) of the article [[Geopotential model]] one therefore gets that
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
f_r = J_2\ \frac{1}{r^4}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \left(3\ \sin^2 i\ \sin^2 u\ -\ 1\right)
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|18}}}}

Secondly the projection of direction north, &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt;, on the plane spanned by &lt;math&gt;\hat{t}\ ,\ \hat{z},&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\sin i \ \cos u \ \hat{t}\ +\ \cos i \ \hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and this projection is 
:&lt;math&gt;\cos \lambda \ \hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; orthogonal to the radial direction towards north illustrated in figure 1.

From equation (12) of the article [[Geopotential model]] one therefore gets that

:&lt;math&gt;f_\lambda \ \hat{\lambda}\ =\ -J_2\ \frac{1}{r^4}\ 3\ \sin\lambda\ (\sin i \ \cos u \ \hat{t}\ +\ \cos i \ \hat{z}) =\ -J_2\ \frac{1}{r^4}\ 3\ \sin i \ \sin u\ (\sin i \ \cos u \ \hat{t}\ +\ \cos i \ \hat{z})\,&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore:
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
f_t  =\ -J_2\ \frac{1}{r^4}\ 3\ \sin^2 i\ \sin u\ \cos u
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|19}}}}
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
f_z =\ -J_2\ \frac{1}{r^4}\ 3\ \sin i\ \cos i\ \sin u
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|20}}}}

===Perturbation of the orbital plane===
From ({{EquationNote|5}}) and ({{EquationNote|20}}) one gets that

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \hat{z}\ =\ -J_2\ \frac{3\ \sin i\ \cos i}{\mu p^2}\left[\hat{g}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{p}{r}\ \sin u\ \cos u \ du
+\ \hat{h}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{p}{r}\ \sin^2 u\ du \right]\quad \times \ \hat{z}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|21}}}}

The fraction &lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{r}\ =\ 1\ +\ e\ \cos (u-\omega)\ =\ 1\ +\ e\ \cos u\ \cos\omega\ +\ e\ \sin u\ \sin\omega\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;e\,&lt;/math&gt; is the eccentricity
and &lt;math&gt;\omega\,&lt;/math&gt; is the argument of perigee 
of the reference [[Kepler orbit]]

As all integrals of type
:&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \cos^m u \ \sin^n u\ du\,&lt;/math&gt;
are zero if not both &lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m\,&lt;/math&gt; are even one gets from ({{EquationNote|21}}) that

:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \hat{z}\ =\ -2\pi\ \frac{J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \sin i\ \cos i\ \quad \hat{h} \times \hat{z}
&lt;/math&gt;

As
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{n}\ =\ \cos i\ \hat{z}\ + \sin i\ \hat{h}
&lt;/math&gt;

this can be written
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \hat{z}\ =\ -2\pi\ \frac{J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos i\ \quad \hat{n} \times \hat{z}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|22}}}}

As  &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}&lt;/math&gt; is an inertially fixed vector (the direction of the spin axis of the Earth) relation ({{EquationNote|22}}) is the equation of motion for a unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt; describing a cone around &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}&lt;/math&gt; with a precession rate (radians per orbit) of &lt;math&gt;-2\pi\ \frac{J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos i\,&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of orbital elements this is expressed as

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta i\ =\ 0
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|23}}}}
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \Omega\ =\ -2\pi\ \frac{J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos i
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|24}}}}

where
:&lt;math&gt;i\,&lt;/math&gt; is the inclination of the orbit to the equatorial plane of the Earth

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega\,&lt;/math&gt; is the right ascension of the ascending node

===Perturbation of the eccentricity vector===

From ({{EquationNote|16}}), ({{EquationNote|18}}) and ({{EquationNote|19}}) follows that in-plane perturbation of the eccentricity vector is

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \bar{e}\ =\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left(-\hat{t}\ \left(\frac{p}{r}\right)^2\ \frac{3}{2}\ \left(3\ \sin^2 i\ \sin^2 u\ -\ 1\right)\ - \ \left(2\ \hat{r}-\frac{V_r}{V_t}\ \hat{t}\right)\ \left(\frac{p}{r}\right)^2\ 3\ \sin^2 i \cos u\ \sin u\right)du 
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|25}}}}

the new eccentricity vector being the projection of 
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{e}+\Delta \bar{e}&lt;/math&gt;

on the new orbital plane orthogonal to
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{z}+\Delta \hat{z}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta \hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt; is given by ({{EquationNote|22}})

Relative the coordinate system
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{g}=\hat{a}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{h}=\cos i\ \hat{b}\ +\ \sin i\ \hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt;

one has that

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{r}=\cos u\ \hat{g}\ +\ \sin u\ \hat{h}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{t}=-\sin u\ \hat{g}\ +\ \cos u\ \hat{h}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Using that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {p}{r}\ =\ 1 + e \cdot \cos \theta\ =\ 1 + e_g \cdot \cos u + e_h \cdot \sin u&lt;/math&gt;
and that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {V_r}{V_t} = \frac {e_g \cdot \sin u\ -\ e_h \cdot \cos u}{\frac {p}{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;e_g =\ e\ \cos \omega&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e_h =\ e\ \sin \omega&lt;/math&gt;

are the components of the eccentricity vector in the &lt;math&gt;\hat{g}\ ,\ \hat{h}\,&lt;/math&gt; coordinate system this integral ({{EquationNote|25}}) can be evaluated analytically, the result is

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \bar{e}\ =\ -2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2} \left(\frac{3}{2}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right)\ \left(-e_h \hat{g}\ +\ e_g \hat{h}\right)\ =\ -2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2} \frac{3}{2} \left(\frac{3}{2}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right)\ \hat{z}\ \times \  \bar{e}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|26}}}}

This the difference equation of motion for the eccentricity vector &lt;math&gt;\bar{e}\,&lt;/math&gt; to form a circle, the magnitude of the eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e\,&lt;/math&gt; staying constant.

Translating this to orbital elements it must be remembered that the new eccentricity vector obtained by adding &lt;math&gt;\Delta \bar{e}\ \,&lt;/math&gt; to the old &lt;math&gt;\bar{e}\ \,&lt;/math&gt; must be projected to the new orbital plane obtained by applying ({{EquationNote|23}}) and ({{EquationNote|24}})

[[File:J2-perturbation.svg|thumb|right|Figure 3: The change &lt;math&gt;\Delta\omega\,&lt;/math&gt; in "argument of perigee" after one orbit is the sum of a contribution &lt;math&gt;\Delta \omega_1\,&lt;/math&gt; caused by the in-plane force components and a contribution &lt;math&gt;\Delta \omega_2\,&lt;/math&gt; caused by the use of the ascending node as reference]]
This is illustrated  in figure 3:

To the change in argument of the eccentricity vector

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \omega_1\ =\ -2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2} \left(\frac{3}{2}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

must be added an increment due to the precession of the orbital plane (caused by the out-of-plane force component) amounting to

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \omega_2\ =\ -\cos i\ \Delta\Omega \ =\ 2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos^2 i\,&lt;/math&gt;

One therefore gets that

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta e\ =0
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|27}}}}

In terms of the components of the eccentricity vector &lt;math&gt;e_g,e_h\,&lt;/math&gt; relative the coordinate system &lt;math&gt;\hat{g} ,\hat{h}\,&lt;/math&gt; that precesses around the polar axis of the Earth the same is expressed as follows

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;(\Delta e_g,\Delta e_h)\ = \\
&amp;-2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2} \left(\frac{3}{2}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right)\ (-e_h ,e_g)\ + \ 2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos^2 i\ (-e_h ,e_g ) = \\
&amp;-2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ 3 \left(\frac{5}{4}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right)\ (-e_h ,e_g) 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|29}}}}

where the first term is the in-plane perturbation of the eccentricity vector and the second is the effect of the new position of the ascending node in the new plane

From ({{EquationNote|28}}) follows that &lt;math&gt;\Delta \omega\,&lt;/math&gt; is zero if &lt;math&gt;\sin^2 i\ =\frac{4}{5}\,&lt;/math&gt;. This fact is used for [[Molniya orbit]]s having an inclination of 63.4 deg. An orbit with an inclination of 180 - 63.4 deg = 116.6 deg would in the same way have a constant argument of perigee.

====Proof====

Proof that the integral

#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left(-\hat{t}\ \left(\frac{p}{r}\right)^2\ \frac{3}{2}\ \left(3\ \sin^2 i\ \sin^2 u\ -\ 1\right)\ - \ \left(2\ \hat{r}-\frac{V_r}{V_t}\ \hat{t}\right)\ \left(\frac{p}{r}\right)^2\ 3\ \sin^2 i \cos u\ \sin u\right)du 
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|30}}}}

where:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{r}=\cos u\ \hat{G}\ +\ \sin u\ \hat{H}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{t}=-\sin u\ \hat{G}\ +\ \cos u\ \hat{H}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{r}\ =\ 1\ +\ e_g\ \cos u\ +\ e_h\ \sin u&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_r}{V_t}\ =\ \frac{e_g\ \sin u\ -\ e_h\ \cos u}{\frac{p}{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

has the value 
#    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
-2\pi\  \frac{3}{2} \left(\frac{3}{2}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right)\ \left(-e_h \hat{G}\ +\ e_g \hat{H}\right)

{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}}

The '''playoffs''', '''play-offs''', '''postseason'''  and/or '''finals''' of a [[sports league]] are a competition played after the [[Regular season|regular season]] by the top competitors to determine the league champion or a similar accolade. Depending on the league, the playoffs may be either a single game, a series of games, or a [[tournament]], and may use a [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] system or one of several other [[playoff format|different playoff formats]]. Playoff, in regard to international fixtures, is to qualify or progress to the next round of a competition or tournament.

In team sports in the U.S. and Canada, the vast distances and consequent burdens on cross-country travel have led to regional divisions of teams. Generally, during the regular season, teams play more games in their division than outside it, but the league's best teams might not play against each other in the regular season. Therefore, in the postseason a playoff series is organized. Any group-winning team is eligible to participate, and as playoffs became more popular they were expanded to include second- or even lower-placed teams – the term "[[wild card (sports)|wild card]]" refers to these teams.

In England and Scotland, playoffs are used in [[association football]] to decide [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] for lower-finishing teams, rather than to decide a champion in the way they are used in North America. In the [[EFL Championship]] (the second tier of English football), teams finishing 3rd to 6th after the regular season compete to decide the final promotion spot to the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Football League Regulations – Section 3|url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/regulations/20120702/section-3-the-league_2293633_2125717#10|publisher=football league|accessdate=31 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929122708/http://www.football-league.co.uk/regulations/20120702/section-3-the-league_2293633_2125717#10|archivedate=29 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American football==
===National Football League===
{{Main|NFL playoffs}}

Evidence of playoffs in [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional football]] dates to at least 1919, when the "[[New York Pro Football League|New York Pro Championship]]" was held in [[Western New York]] (it is possible one was held in 1917, but that is not known for sure). The [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] metropolitan areas each played a championship game, the winners of which would advance to the "New York Pro Championship" on Thanksgiving weekend. The top New York teams were eventually absorbed into the NFL upon its founding in 1920, but the league (mostly driven by an [[Ohio League]] that did not have true championship games, though they frequently scheduled ''de facto'' championship matchups) did not adopt the New York league's playoff format, opting for a championship based on regular season record for its first twelve seasons; as a result, four of the first six "championships" were disputed. Technically, a vote of league owners was all that was required to win a title, but the owners had a [[gentlemen's agreement]] to pledge votes based on a score (wins divided by the sum of wins and losses, with a few tiebreakers). When two teams tied at the top of the standings in 1932, an [[NFL Playoff Game, 1932|impromptu playoff game]] was scheduled to settle the tie.

The [[National Football League]] divided its teams into divisions in 1933 and began holding a single playoff championship game between division winners. In 1950 the NFL absorbed three teams from the rival [[All-America Football Conference]], and the former "Divisions" were now called "Conferences", echoing the college use of that term. In 1967, the NFL expanded and created four divisions under the two conferences, which led to the institution of a larger playoff tournament. After the [[AFL-NFL merger]] brought the [[American Football League]] into the NFL, the NFL began to use three divisions and a single wild card team in each conference for its playoffs, in order to produce eight contenders out of six divisions; this was later expanded in 1978 &amp; 1990 so that more wild card teams could participate.

In 2002 the NFL added its 32nd team, the [[Houston Texans]], and significantly reshuffled its divisional alignment. The league went from 6 division winners and 6 wild card spots to 8 division winners and only 4 wild card qualifiers. The winners of each division automatically earn a playoff spot and a home game in their first rounds, and the two top non-division winners from each conference will also make the playoffs as wild-card teams. The top two teams with the best records in the regular season get a first round bye, and each of the bottom two division winners plays one of the two wild-card teams. Each winner of a wild-card game then plays one of the two bye teams. The winners of these two games go to the conference championships, and the winners of those conference championship games then face each other in the [[Super Bowl]].

===College football===
====Division I NCAA Football FBS====
{{Main|College Football Playoff National Championship}}
The '''College Football Playoff National Championship''' is a post-season [[college football]] [[bowl game]], used to determine a [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national champion]] of the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS), which began play in the [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2014 college football season]].&lt;ref name="USA Today April 25. 2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2013/04/24/college-football-playoff-questions-and-answers/2111419/|title=Questions and answers for the College Football Playoff|last=Wolken |first=Dan |date=25 April 2013 |publisher=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game serves as the final of the [[College Football Playoff]], a [[bracket (tournament)|bracket tournament]] between the top four teams in the country as determined by a selection committee, which was established as a successor to the [[Bowl Championship Series]] and its similar [[BCS National Championship Game]]. Unlike the BCS championship, the participating teams in the College Football Playoff National Championship are determined by two semi-final bowls—hosted by two of the consortium's six member bowls yearly—and the top two teams as determined by the selection committee do not automatically advance to the game in lieu of other bowls.

The game is played at a neutral site, determined through bids by prospective host cities (similarly to the [[Super Bowl]] and [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Final Four]]). When announcing it was soliciting bids for the 2016 and 2017 title games, playoff organizers noted that the bids must propose host stadiums with a capacity of at least 65,000 spectators,&lt;ref name="stadium-future"&gt;{{cite web|title=CFB playoff opens bidding for 2016, '17 championship games|author=Jerry Hinnen|publisher=CBSSports.com|date=August 7, 2013|accessdate=August 9, 2013|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/blog/eye-on-college-football/23053828/cfb-playoff-opens-bidding-for-2016-2017-championship-games}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stadium-future"/&gt; and cities cannot host both a semi-final game and the title game in the same year.&lt;ref name="future-hosting"&gt;{{cite web|title=More bids on future title game sites|author=Brett McMurphy|publisher=ESPN.com|date=July 26, 2013|accessdate=August 10, 2013|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/9511533/at-least-7-cities-bid-2016-2017-title-games-sources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winner of the game is awarded a new championship trophy instead of the [[AFCA National Championship Trophy|"crystal football"]], which has been given by the [[American Football Coaches Association]] (AFCA) since 1986; officials wanted a new trophy that was unconnected with the previous BCS championship system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New College Football Playoff will reportedly feature a new trophy|author=Dennis Dodd|publisher=CBSSports.com|date=July 23, 2013|accessdate=July 30, 2013|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/blog/dennis-dodd/22857775/say-goodbye-to-the-crystal-football-bcs-symbol-will-not-be-retained}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[College Football Playoff National Championship Trophy]] is sponsored by [[Dr Pepper]], which paid an estimated $35 million for the sponsorship rights through 2020.&lt;ref name="trophy"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESPN Inks Dr Pepper as First Mega-Sponsor of the College Football Playoff Series|author=Anthony Crupi|publisher=Adweek|date=March 25, 2014|accessdate=April 7, 2014|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/espn-inks-dr-pepper-first-mega-sponsor-college-football-playoff-series-156518}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 26.5-inch high, 35-pound trophy was unveiled on July 14, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Prisbell, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2014/07/14/college-football-playoff-trophy-unveiling/12624861/ College Football Playoff national championship trophy unveiled], ''USA Today'', July 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

====Division I NCAA Football FCS====
{{Main|NCAA Division I Football Championship}} 
The '''NCAA Division I Football Championship'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.div1fbchampionship.com/|title=NCAA Division I Football Championship|website=www.div1fbchampionship.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[college football]] tournament played each year to determine the champion of the [[NCAA Division I]] [[Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS). Prior to 2006, the game was known as the '''NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship'''. The FCS is the  highest division in college football to hold a playoff tournament sanctioned by the NCAA to determine its champion. The [[College Football Playoff|four-team playoff system]] used by the [[Division I-A|Bowl Subdivision]] is not sanctioned by the NCAA.

====Division II NCAA Football====
{{Main|NCAA Division II Football Championship}}
The '''NCAA Division II Football Championship''' is an American [[college football]] tournament played annually to determine a champion at the [[NCAA Division II]] level. It was first held in 1973. Prior to 1973, four regional [[bowl game]]s were played in order to provide postseason action for what was then called the "NCAA College Division" and a poll determined the final champion.

The National Championship game was held at [[Sacramento, California]] from 1973 to 1975. It was in [[Wichita Falls, Texas]] in 1976 and 1977. The game was played in [[Longview, Texas]] in 1978. For 1979 and 1980, [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] hosted the game. [[McAllen, Texas]] hosted the championship games from 1981 to 1985. From 1986 to 2013, the Division II championship game was played at [[Braly Municipal Stadium]] near the campus of the [[University of North Alabama]] in [[Florence, Alabama]]. Between 2014 and 2017, the championship game was played at [[Children's Mercy Park]] in [[Kansas City, Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingkc.com/news/2013/12/kansas-city-host-14-ncaa-championships|title=Kansas City to host 14 NCAA championships|work=Sporting Kansas City}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1994, the games have been broadcast on [[ESPN]].

====Division III NCAA Football====
{{Main|NCAA Division III Football Championship}}
The '''[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] [[college football|Football]] Championship''' began in [[1973 in sports|1973]]. Before 1973, most of the schools now in Division III competed either in the NCAA College Division or the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA). NCAA Divisions II and III were created by splitting the College Division in two, with schools that wished to continue awarding [[athletic scholarship]]s placed in Division II and those that did not want to award them placed in Division III.

The Division III playoffs begin with 32 teams selected to participate in the playoffs. The Division III championship game, known as the '''[[Amos Alonzo Stagg|Stagg]] Bowl''', has been played annually in [[Salem, Virginia|Salem]], [[Virginia]] at [[Salem Football Stadium]] since 1993. It was previously played in [[Phenix City, Alabama|Phenix City]], [[Alabama]] at [[Garrett-Harrison Stadium]] (1973–1982, 1985–1989), at the [[College Football Hall of Fame]], when the Hall was located in [[Kings Island, Ohio|Kings Island]], [[Ohio]] at [[Galbreath Field]] (1983–1984), and [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]], [[Florida]] at [[Hawkins Stadium]] (1990–1992).

==Association football==
As a rule, international [[association football]] has only had championship playoffs when a league is divided into several equal divisions/conferences/groups ([[Major League Soccer]]) and/or when the season is [[Apertura and Clausura|split into two periods]] (as in many leagues in Latin America, such as Mexico's [[Liga MX]]). In leagues with a single table done only once a year, as in most of Europe, playoff systems are not used to determine champions, although in some countries such systems are used to determine teams to be promoted to higher leagues (e.g., England) or qualifiers for European club competitions (such as Greece and the Netherlands), usually between teams that didn't perform well enough to earn an automatic spot.

A ''test match'' is a match played at the end of a season between a team that has done badly in a higher league and one that has done well in a lower league of the same football [[league system]]. The format of a test match series varies; for instance it can be a head-to-head between one of the worse finishers of the higher league and one of the better finishers of the lower league, or it can be a mini league where all participants play each other or teams only play those from the other league. The winner of the test match series play in the higher league the following season, and the loser in the lower league.

=== International playoffs ===
In international [[association football|football]], playoffs were a feature of the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]] and [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] final tournaments. They are still a feature of the qualification tournaments for the [[FIFA World Cup]] and the [[UEFA European Football Championship]].

In the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification playoffs]] for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], for example:
* In [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (play-off UEFA)|Europe]], after the first-place finishers in each of eight groups received automatic finals places, along with the two second-place teams that had earned the most points against teams in the top six of their individual groups, the remaining six second-placed teams entered playoffs to select three teams for the finals.
* The winners of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (OFC)|Oceania qualifying tournament]], [[Australia national association football team|Australia]] [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (play-off CONMEBOL-OFC)|played]] the fifth placed team from the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|South American qualifying tournament]], [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]].
* The fifth-placed team of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|Asia qualifying tournament]], [[Bahrain national football team|Bahrain]] [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (play-off AFC-CONCACAF)|played]] the fourth-placed team in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|CONCACAF qualifying tournament]], [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]].

=== Knockout competitions ===
In addition to their league competitions, most European footballing nations also have [[single elimination tournament|knockout cup competitions]] – English football, for example, has the [[FA Cup]] and the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]]. These competitions are open to many teams — 92 clubs compete for the League Cup, and hundreds compete for the FA Cup. These competitions run concurrently with the "regular season" league competitions and are not regarded as playoffs.

===Argentina===
In [[Argentina|Argentine]] football, playoffs in the style of the English leagues occur in the [[Primera B Metropolitana]], part of the third tier, and leagues below it ([[Primera C Metropolitana]] and [[Primera D Metropolitana]]). All ''Primera Metropolitana'' tourneys cover the area in and around [[Buenos Aires]], the capital city. The ''Torneo Reducidos'' (reduced tournaments), however, involve 8 teams below the top two, as opposed to 4.

Before the top-flight [[Argentine Primera División]] abandoned its traditional [[Apertura and Clausura]] format in 2015 in favor of an expanded single season, there was no playoff between the Apertura and Clausura winners.  As a result, the league crowned two champions each year. After each Clausura, the two teams with the lowest points-per-game total for the previous six tournaments (three years, counting only Primera División games) were relegated to [[Primera B Nacional]] to be replaced by that league's champion and runner-up teams; the two teams immediately above contested promotion/relegation series with the third and fourth places in Primera B Nacional, counted by its aggregate table. In Primera B Nacional, the same procedure continues in use for relegation to either Primera B Metropolitana or [[Torneo Argentino A]] for non-Buenos Aires clubs. From 2015 onward, relegation from the Primera División will be based solely on league position at the end of the season (which, effective in 2016–17, changed from a February–December format to an August–June format).

=== Australia ===
The Australian [[A-League]], which also features [[Wellington Phoenix FC|a team in New Zealand]], has determined its champions via a playoff system, officially known as the "Finals Series" (reflecting standard Australian English usage), since its inception in the [[2005–06 A-League|2005–06 season]].

From the league's inception through the [[2008–09 A-League|2008–09 season]], the top four teams advanced to the finals series, employed using a modified [[Page playoff system]]. The top two teams at the end of league play were matched in one semifinal, with the winner advancing directly to the Grand Final and the loser going into the Preliminary Final. The next two teams played a semifinal for a place in the Preliminary Final, whose winner took the other place in the Grand Final. Both semifinals were two-legged, while the Preliminary Final and Grand Final were one-off matches.

When the league expanded to 10 teams beginning in [[2009–10 A-League|2009–10]], the finals expanded to six teams. The format of the six-team playoff established at that time was:
* The "semifinals" were held over a two-week period. The pairings for Week 1 of the semifinals were 1 vs 2, 3 vs 6, and 4 vs 5.
* In Week 1, the top two teams played the first leg of a two-legged match, and the remaining teams played one-off knockout matches.
* In Week 2, the top two teams played the second leg of their semifinal, and the two other surviving teams played a one-off match. The winner of the two-legged match advanced directly to the Grand Final, while the loser of that match joined the winner of the last semifinal in the Preliminary Final.
* The Preliminary Final and Grand Final remained unchanged.

Starting with the [[2012–13 A-League|2012–13 season]], the finals format has been changed to a pure knockout tournament consisting entirely of one-off matches:
* In Week 1, two Elimination Finals will be held, with the pairings being 3 vs 6 and 4 vs 5.
* In Week 2, the winners of the Elimination Finals advance to Semi-Finals. The top team on the regular-season table, called the "premiers" by the A-League, plays the lowest-seeded survivor of the Elimination Finals, and the second-place team plays the other Elimination Final survivor.
* The Grand Final, pitting the two Semi-Final winners, takes place in Week 3.

It should be noted that the concept of a finals series/playoff is standard in Australian sport.

=== Belgium ===
The [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Belgian First Division A|First Division A]] (previously known as the "First Division" and "Pro League") has a fairly complex playoff system, currently consisting of two levels and at one time three.

Since the 2009–10 season, playoffs have been held to determine the champion and tickets for the Champions League and Europa League. The six highest ranked teams play home-and-away matches against each other; a total of 10 matches each. The 6 participating teams start with the points accumulated during the regular competition divided by two. The first 3 teams after the play-offs get a European ticket. The fourth ranked team (or fifth, when the cup holder is already qualified for European football) plays a knock-out match against the winner of play-off 2. From 2009–10 through 2015–16, teams ranked 7–14 played in two groups; from 2016–17 forward, this playoff will continue to be contested in two groups, but with a total of 12 teams (details below). All points gained from the regular competition are lost. The two group winners play a final match to determine the winner of play-off 2. The winning team plays a final match against the fourth-ranked team (or fifth) for the last European ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksvroeselare.be/index.php?id=533 |title=KSV Roeselare – #oltegoareroeselare |publisher=Ksvroeselare.be |date= |accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play-off system has been criticized because more points per match can be earned in the play-off stage than in the regular competition. This way the team who wins the most matches isn't automatically the national champion. The biggest upside in favor of the play-off system is the higher number of matches (40 instead of 34 compared to the previous season) and more top matches. The extra matches also generate higher revenues for the teams.

Nonetheless, the higher number of matches takes an extra toll on teams and players. Besides play-offs, the Royal Belgian Football Association (KBVB) also introduced Christmas football in order to complete the extra matches in time. This posed some problems because a few matches had to be cancelled due to snowy pitches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sporza.be/cm/sporza/voetbal/Jupiler_Pro_League/091219_charleroi_standard_vooraf |title=Sneeuwval maakt voetballen onmogelijk |language =Dutch|date = 19 December 2009 |website = Sporza |accessdate = 2009-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20091224110500/http://www.sporza.be/cm/sporza/voetbal/Jupiler_Pro_League/091219_charleroi_standard_vooraf |archivedate=2009-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The delays will probably cause the tight schedule to fail and postpone the end of the season.{{speculation inline}}

Some structural changes were instituted in [[2015–16 Belgian Pro League|2015–16]]:
* The team that finished atop the regular-season table is now assured of a Europa League place if they fail to finish in a Champions League qualifying spot (currently top two places).
* The first tiebreaker between Championship Round teams is now regular-season position.
* Accumulated yellow cards from the regular season are erased, although suspensions will continue to carry over. During the playoffs, three accumulated yellow cards will result in a suspension, as opposed to five during the regular season.

From 1974 through 2015, the 15th team out of 16 in the final standings was involved in a playoff pool with three teams from the [[Belgian First Division B|Belgian Second Division]] after each season, to determine which of these teams played in the First Division/Pro League the oncoming season. The lowest ranked team of the First Division/Pro League was relegated and replaced by the Second Division champion.

Originally, these playoffs were introduced in 1974 and were part of the Second Division, to determine which team was promoted to the highest level together with the division champions. From the [[2005–06 Belgian First Division|2005–06 season]] on, only one team was relegated directly from the First Division, with the 17th team taking part in the playoff. As a result, this playoff was still called the [[Belgian Second Division Final Round]], although one team from the Pro League took part each year.

Starting in 2015–16, this playoff was scrapped and replaced with direct relegation for the bottom Pro League/First Division A team only.

Further changes will be introduced to the Europa League playoffs from 2016–17 forward. The playoff will involve a total of 12 teams—nine from First Division A, and three from First Division B (the renamed Second Division). The First Division A qualifiers will be those finishing between 7th and 15th on the regular-season table. The First Division B qualifiers will be the top three teams from that league's regular-season table, excluding the division champion, which instead earns promotion to First Division A. As in the previous format, the teams will be divided into two groups, each playing home-and-away within the group, and the two group winners will play a one-off final, with the winner of that match advancing to a one-off match against the fourth- or fifth-place team from the championship playoff (depending on available European slots) for the final Europa League place.

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, the [[Copa do Brasil]], the second most prestigious country-wide competition, is contested in pure "knockout" format since its inception in 1989. While the top two tiers in the Brazilian League – [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Série A]] and [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série B|Série B]] – are contested in double round robin format, the lower tiers [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série C|Série C]] and [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série D|Série D]] include knockout rounds in their final stages.

=== Bulgaria ===
Bulgaria instituted an elaborate playoff system in its top flight, the [[First Professional Football League (Bulgaria)|First League]], in the 2016–17 season.

After the league's 14 teams play a full home-and-away season, the league splits into two playoffs—a 6-team "championship playoff" and an 8-team "qualifying playoff", with the latter split into two 4-team groups. Each playoff begins with teams carrying over all goals and statistics from the home-and-away season.

Each team in the championship playoff plays the others home and away one additional time. At the end of this stage:
* The top team is declared league champion, and earns the country's sole place in the UEFA Champions League.
* The second-place team earns a place in the UEFA Europa League.
* The highest-placed team that has not already qualified for European competition advances to an eventual one-off match for the country's final Europa League place. This will often be the third-place team, but if the winner of the Bulgarian Cup (which earns an automatic Europa League place) is in the top three of the playoff, the fourth-place team will take its place.

Each group within the qualifying playoff also plays home and away within its group; after this stage, teams enter another level of playoffs depending on their positions in the group.

The top two teams in each group enter a knockout playoff consisting entirely of two-legged matches (unless one of these teams is the winner of that season's Bulgarian Cup, in which case it will not enter the playoff and the team that it would have played receives a bye into the playoff final). The winner of this playoff then contests a one-off match against the third-place (or fourth-place) team from the championship playoff, with the winner claiming the final Europa League place.

The bottom two teams from each group begin a series of relegation playoffs. The series starts with a knockout playoff that also consists entirely of two-legged matches. The winner of the playoff remains in the First League for the following season. The losing teams then enter the following series of two-legged promotion/relegation matches:
# The losers of the knockout semifinals play, with the loser relegated to the Second League.
# The loser of the knockout final plays the third-place team from the Second League, with the winner playing in the next season's First League.
# Finally, the winner of Match 1 above plays the second-place team from the Second League, with the winner also playing in the next season's First League.

=== Dominican Republic ===
With the creation of the [[Liga Dominicana de Fútbol]] in 2014 to replace the [[Primera División de Republica Dominicana]], it introduced a playoff system to determine the champion of the season.

=== England ===
{{Main|English Football League play-offs}}

When [[English Football League|the Football League]] was first expanded to two divisions in 1892, [[Football League test matches|test matches]] were employed to decide relegation and promotion between them, but the practice was scrapped in favour of automatic relegation and promotion in 1898.

The use of play-offs to decide promotion issues returned to the League in 1986 with the desire to reduce the number of mid-table clubs with nothing to play for at the end of the season. The Football Conference, now known as the [[National League (English football)|National League]], introduced play-offs in 2002 after the Football League agreed to a two-club exchange with the Conference.

The top two teams in the [[EFL Championship]] and in [[EFL League One]] are automatically promoted to the division above and thus do not compete in the play-offs. The top three teams in [[EFL League Two]] and the champion of the [[National League (division)|National League]] (formerly known as Conference Premier) are also automatically promoted. In each of these divisions the four clubs finishing below the automatic promotion places compete in two-legged semi-finals with the higher-placed club enjoying home advantage in the second leg. The [[away goals rule]] does not apply for the semi-finals. The Football League play-off finals were originally played in two legs, at both teams' home grounds, but were later changed to one-off affairs, which are played at [[Wembley Stadium]] in London.

Teams are also promoted using a play-off tournament from levels six to eight of the [[English football league system|football pyramid]].  At level six, the play-off semi finals are two leg ties with the final being a single match played at the home ground of the highest placed of the two teams.  At levels seven and eight, all of the ties are single matches played at the home ground of the team with the highest league position.

In 2003, [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] proposed replacing the current play-off system with one involving six clubs from each division and replacing the two-legged ties with one-off matches.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} If adopted, the two higher-placed clubs in the play-offs would have enjoyed first-round byes and home advantage in the semi-finals. It was a controversial proposal — some people did not believe a club finishing only in eighth position in the League could (or should) compete in the [[FA Premier League|Premiership]] while others found the system too American for their liking.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Although League chairmen initially voted in favour of the proposal, it was blocked by [[The Football Association|The FA]] and soon abandoned.

The championship of every division in English football is determined solely by the standings in the league. However, a championship play-off would be held if the top two teams were tied for points, goal difference and goals scored in both their overall league record; to date, this has never happened. A play-off would also be scheduled if two teams are tied as above for a position affecting promotion, relegation, or European qualification.

=== Greece ===
Starting in [[2007–08 Superleague Greece|the 2007–08 season]], [[Superleague Greece]] instituted a playoff system to determine all of its places in European competition for the following season, except for those of the league champion and the [[Greek Football Cup|cup winner]]. Currently, the league is entitled to two Champions League places and three in the Europa League, with one of the Europa League places reserved for the cup winner. The playoff currently takes the form of a home-and-away mini-league involving the second- through fifth-place teams, under the following conditions:
* The fifth-place team starts the playoffs at 0 points.
* The remaining teams start with a number of "bonus points" determined as follows:
** The number of points earned by the fifth-place team during the main league season is subtracted from the totals of each other club involved in the playoffs.
** The resulting number is then divided by 5 and rounded to the nearest whole number.
* At the end of the playoffs, the winner receives the country's second Champions League place. The next two teams enter the Europa League at different points depending on their playoff finishes; the last-placed team is entirely out of European competition. However, if the cup winner finished in a playoff spot (as happened in [[2010–11 Superleague Greece|2010–11]]), ''or'' the league champion also won the cup, and the losing cup finalist finished in a playoff spot (as happened in [[2012–13 Superleague Greece|2012–13]]), the bottom three teams in the playoff all receive Europa League berths.

=== Italy ===
In 2004-05, Italy's professional league introduced a promotion playoff to its second tier of football, [[Serie B]]. It operates almost identically to the system currently used in England. The top two clubs in Serie B earn automatic promotion to [[Serie A]] with the next four clubs entering a playoff to determine who wins the third promotion place, as long as fewer than 10 points separate the third and fourth-placed teams (which often occurs).

Like the English playoffs, the Italian playoffs employ two-legged semi-finals, with the higher finisher in the league table earning home advantage in the second leg. If the teams are level on aggregate after full-time of the second leg, away goals are not used, but extra time is used. Unlike England, the Italian playoff final is two-legged, again with the higher finisher earning home advantage in the second leg. In both rounds, if the tie is level on aggregate after extra time in the second leg, the team that finished higher in the league standings wins.

In 2003–04, Italy's football league used a two-legged test match to determine one spot in the top level of its system, [[Serie A]]. Some leagues in continental Europe combine automatic promotion/relegation with test matches. For example, in the Netherlands, only one club is automatically relegated from its top level, the [[Eredivisie]], each season, with the winner of the second-flight being promoted. The next two lower-placed teams enter a promotion/relegation mini-league with high-placed teams from the [[Eerste Divisie|Dutch First Division]]

=== Japan ===
[[J.League]] in Japan used a test match series between the third-from-bottom team in J1 and third-place team in J2 (see [[J. League Promotion/Relegation Series]]) from 2004 to 2008. The Promotion/Relegation Series concept dates as far back as 1965 and the first season of the [[Japan Soccer League]].

The [[Japan Football League]], the current Japanese third division, uses the Promotion/Relegation Series only when the number of clubs in the league needs to be filled with clubs from the [[Japanese Regional Leagues]].

A new Promotion/Relegation Series will occur beginning with the 2012 season of [[J. League Division 2]], conditional on the top two JFL teams fulfilling [[J. League Associate Membership|J. League club criteria]]. In turn, J2 will implement a playoff on the style of England for the 3rd to 6th clubs.

=== Mexico ===
Mexico's top flight league, [[Liga MX]], is contested annually by 18 teams.  In each of [[Apertura and Clausura|two annual tournaments]], every team plays every other team in the league once (17 games), after which the top eight teams advance to the ''Liguilla''.

In the Liguilla, all rounds are home-and-away.  Teams are drawn so the best team plays the worst, the second-best plays the second-worst, and so on.  After one round, the teams are redrawn so the best remaining team again plays the worst remaining one and the second-best faces the second-worst in the semi-finals.  The two winners of this round play each other for the championship.

There is no playoff between the Apertura and Clausura winner.  As a result, the league crowns two champions each year.  After each Clausura, the team with the lowest points-per-game total for the previous six tournaments (three years, counting only Liga MX games) is relegated to [[Ascenso MX]] to be replaced by that league's champion (if eligible).

=== Netherlands ===
In the Netherlands, a playoff was introduced in season 2005–2006. It is used to determine which teams from the [[Eredivisie]] qualify for European football. The playoff system has been criticized by clubs, players and fans as the number of matches will increase. Under the original playoff format, it was possible, though thoroughly unlikely, that the runner-up would not qualify for Europe; the following year, the format was changed so that the second-place team was assured of no worse than a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] berth. Starting in 2008–09, the format was changed yet again. The champion goes directly to the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]; the runner-up enters the second qualification round of the CL; the number three enters the fourth (and last) qualification round of the UEFA Europa League (EL; the new name of the UEFA Cup from 2009–10 onward) and the number four goes to the third qualification round of the EL. The only play-off will be for the clubs placed 5th through 8th. The winner of that play-off receives a ticket for the second qualification round of the EL.

Playoffs are also part of the [[promotion and relegation]] structure between the [[Eredivisie]] and the [[Eerste Divisie]], the two highest football leagues in the Netherlands.

=== Scotland ===
The [[Scottish Football League]] (SFL) experimented briefly with test matches in 1995–96 and 1996–97, contested between the second-bottom team of the Premier Division and the second-placed team of the First Division.

After the [[Scottish Premier League]] (SPL) and SFL merged in 2013 to form the [[Scottish Professional Football League]] (SPFL), reuniting the top four divisions of Scotland since the breakaway of the SPL in [[1998–99 Scottish Premier League|1998–99]], a modified test match format was introduced between the [[Scottish Premiership]] and [[Scottish Championship]]. The bottom team from the first-tier Premiership is automatically relegated and is replaced by the winners of the second-tier Championship, provided that club meets Premiership entry criteria. The second-, third- and fourth-placed teams from the Championship qualify for a play-off consisting of two-legged ties, with the second-placed team receiving a bye to play the winner of the teams that finished third and fourth. The winner of this play-off then faces the second-bottom Premiership team, also over two legs, with the winner of that tie taking up the final Premiership place (again, assuming that the Championship club meets Premiership criteria).

The three lower divisions of the SPFL — the Championship, [[Scottish League One|League One]] and [[Scottish League Two|League Two]] — continue with the promotion/relegation play-off system their predecessor SFL leagues used (the [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]], [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]] and [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Third Division]], respectively). In the Championship/League One and League One/League Two, while the champions are automatically promoted and the bottom team relegated, there are play-offs of the second-bottom teams against the second-, third- and fourth-placed teams from the division below. Home and away ties decide semi-finals and a final, and the overall winner plays in the higher division the following season, with the loser playing in the lower division.

Beginning with the 2014–15 season, promotion and relegation between the SPFL and the Scottish regional leagues were introduced. Following the end of the league season, the winners of the fifth-level [[Highland Football League|Highland]] and [[Lowland Football League|Lowland]] Leagues compete in a two-legged playoff. The winner then enters a two-legged playoff against the bottom team from Scottish League Two, with the winner of that tie either remaining in or promoted to League Two.

Long before the SPL era, two situations arose in which the top two teams in the table had to share the title as neither goal average nor goal difference had been instituted to break ties. The first was  [[1890–91 Scottish Football League|the inaugural season]], in which [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] both earned 29 points and had to play off for the title. The match ended in a 0-0 draw and both teams shared the title. The second happened 19 years later, in the [[1909–10 Scottish Second Division|Second Division]], when [[Leith Athletic F.C.|Leith Athletic]] and [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] both earned 33 points. This time, the clubs chose not to play off. In 1915 goal average was finally instituted.

=== Spain ===
For the 2010/11 season, the Segunda División experimented with promotion playoffs between the 3rd to 6th placed teams, similar to the rules in the English and Italian systems. However, due to reserve teams being allowed to compete in the same football league system, subsequent places may be allowed to play off depending on reserve teams finishing within the 3rd to 6th places.

At a lower level, playoffs in Segunda División B take place to decide the divisional title between the 4 group winners, and to decide which other teams would be promoted, as follows:

*The first set of matches are an elimination tournament between the 4 group winners. The winners of each match are promoted and then play a final for the tier title.
*After the tier final takes place, the teams who finished 2nd in each of the 4 groups play the teams who finished 4th, whereas the teams who finished third play each other. The 6 winners, along with the 2 Group winners who lost their games in the earlier semifinals, play in each other in a knockout format until there is 2 teams remaining who are promoted.
*If within the qualifying places exist reserve teams whose senior teams are already in Segunda División, subsequent places are allowed to play off. If the senior teams are relegated from Segunda División during the season, the reserve team is automatically disqualified from competing and relegated to Tercera División.

Previously a play off system had been used in which the teams finishing 3rd and 4th from last in [[La Liga]] had played off against the teams finishing 3rd and 4th in the [[Segunda División]]. This system had been introduced in the 1980s but ended in 1998-99.&lt;ref&gt;[[La Liga 1998-99#Relegation playoff]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States and Canada ===
{{main|MLS Cup Playoffs}}
In [[Major League Soccer]] in the United States and Canada, at the end of the [[regular season]], the top five teams in each of its two conferences qualify for the playoffs (from the [[2012 Major League Soccer season|2012 season]] to the [[2014 Major League Soccer season|2014 season]]). Under this system, the conferences have separate playoff brackets. From 2015 to 2018, six teams per conference qualify, 12 teams in total, and  [[Audi]] is the official sponsor. 
&lt;!-- Next season.
In 2019, there will be eight teams per conference qualifying, 16 teams in total.
--&gt;

In the first round of the [[postseason]] knockout tournament, the fourth-place team in each conference hosts the fifth-place team from the same conference in a one-off match, with the winner advancing to the Conference Semifinals. From the 2015 season the third-place team plays host to the sixth in the other one-off match, with the two winners advancing to the Conference Semifinals.
&lt;!-- Next season.
From the 2019 season the 1st round will change to four two-legged series, and will also be known as the Conference Quarterfinals. The top-seeded team plays eighth, second plays seventh, third plays sixth, and fourth plays fifth. That round will be played like the next two rounds. 
--&gt;
The Conference Semifinals and the Conference Championships are conducted under a home-and-away, aggregate-goal format. For each conference, the top seed plays the first-round winner, and the 2nd seed faces the 3rd seed in the Conference Semifinal series, with the lower seeded team hosting the first game. From the 2015 season the top seed plays the lowest remaining seed, and the 2nd plays the next-lowest seed in the Conference Semifinals.
&lt;!-- Next season.
From the 2019 season the highest remaining seed plays the lowest remaining seed, and the next-highest plays the next-lowest.
--&gt;
The team that scores the most goals in the home-and-away series advances to the Conference Championship, which expands from a one-off match to a two-legged match starting in 2012. If the teams are tied after 90 minutes of the second leg in either the Conference Semifinal or Conference Championship, a 30-minute extra time period (divided into two 15-minute periods) would be played followed by a penalty-kick shootout, if necessary. As in the Conference Semifinals, the lower seed in the Conference Championship hosts the first leg.

The winner of each conference will play for the [[MLS Cup]], the league championship. Since 2012, the MLS Cup is hosted by the conference champion with the most table points during the regular season.

In the case of ties after regulation in the First Round and MLS Cup, 30 minutes of extra time (divided into two 15-minute periods) would be played followed by a penalty-kick shootout, if necessary, to determine the winners.

Historically MLS did not use the away goals rule in any playoff series, but it has begun to do so in 2014 to be consistent with international practice.

The defunct [[Women's Professional Soccer]] (WPS), which operated only in the U.S., conducted a four-team stepladder tournament consisting of one-off knockout matches. The third seed hosted the fourth seed in the first round. The winner of that game advanced to the "Super Semifinal", hosted by the second seed. The Super Semifinal winner traveled to the top seed for the championship game. The replacement of WPS, the [[National Women's Soccer League]] (which launched in 2013), has a more standard four-team knockout playoff in which the winners of two one-off semifinals advance to the one-off final.

==Australian rules football==
{{See also|AFL final eight system|McIntyre System}}

Playoffs are used throughout Australia in [[Australian rules football]] to determine the premiership. The term '''finals''' is most commonly used to describe them.

In each league, between four and eight teams (depending on league size) qualify for the finals based on the league ladder at the end of the season.  Australian rules football leagues employ finals systems which act as a combination between a [[single elimination tournament]] for lower-ranked teams and a [[double elimination tournament]] for higher-ranked teams in order to provide teams with an easier pathway to the Grand Final as reward for strong performances throughout the season. Finals are decided by single matches, rather than series.

The [[Australian Football League]], which is the top level of the sport, currently has eight teams qualify for the finals under a [[AFL final eight system|system designed by the league]] in 2000. Between 1931–1999, variants of the [[McIntyre System]] were used to accommodate four, five, six and eight teams, and prior to 1930, [[Early VFL Final systems|six different finals systems]] were used.

In most other leagues, from state-level leagues such as the [[South Australian National Football League]] and [[West Australian Football League]], down to local suburban leagues, it is most common for either four or five teams to qualify for the finals. In these cases the [[Page–McIntyre system|Page–McIntyre final four system]] or the [[McIntyre final five system]] are used universally.

The [[Australian Football League]] (which was  known until 1990 as the Victorian Football League) was the first league to introduce regular finals when it was established in 1897. The [[South Australian National Football League]] introduced finals in 1898, and other leagues soon followed.

Prior to 1897, the premiership was generally awarded to the team with the best overall win-loss record at the end of the season. If two teams had finished with equal records, a playoff match for the premiership was required: this occurred in the Challenge Cup in 1871, the SAFA in 1889 and 1894, and in the VFA in 1896.

==Baseball==

===Korea===
{{Main|Korean Series}}
The teams finishing in fourth and fifth place in the regular season face each other in the wildcard game. The winner of the wildcard game faces the team that finished in third place in the first round of the play-offs. The winner of the first round faces the team that finished in second place during the regular season, and the winner of that round faces the team that finished in first place for the championship in the Korean Series. This type of format is known as the [[Ladder tournament|stepladder]] playoff.

===Japan===
{{Main|Climax Series}}
Before 1950 the original [[Japanese Baseball League]] had been a single-table league of franchises. After it was reorganized into the [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] (NPB) system, a series of playoffs ensued between the champions of the [[Central League]] and [[Pacific League]].

Before the playoff system was developed in both professional leagues, the Pacific League had applied a playoff system on two occasions. The first was between 1973–1982, when a split-season was applied with a 5-game playoff between the winning teams from both halves of season (unless a team won both of the halves so that they did not need to play such a game). The second time was between 2004–2006, when the top three teams played a two-staged stepladder knockout (3 games in the first stage and 5 games in the second stage) to decide the League Champion (and the team playing in the [[Japan Series]]). After this system was applied, the [[Seibu Lions]] (now Saitama Seibu Lions), [[Chiba Lotte Marines]] and [[Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters]], which claimed the Pacific League Championship under this system, were all able to clinch the following Japan Series in that season. The success of such a playoff system convinced the [[Central League]] to consider a similar approach. In 2007, a new playoff system, named the "Climax Series", was introduced to both professional leagues in NPB to decide the teams that would compete for the Japan Series. The Climax Series basically applied the rule of the playoff system in the Pacific League, with one important change: each League championship is awarded to the team finishing the regular season at the top of their respective league, regardless of their fate in the playoffs. This means that the two League Champions are not guaranteed to make the Japan Series. The [[Chunichi Dragons]] took advantage of this in the first Climax Series season, finishing second in the regular season but sweeping the [[Hanshin Tigers]] and the League Champion [[Yomiuri Giants]] in the Central League to win a place in the Japan Series; they subsequently defeated the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters to claim their first Japan Series in 52 years.

In 2008, the format of Climax Series will have a slight change, in which the second stage will be played over a maximum of six games, with the League Champion starting with an automatic one game advantage.

====Major League Baseball====
{{Main|Major League Baseball postseason}} {{See also|League Championship Series}}
Major League Baseball (MLB) itself does not use the term "playoffs" for championship tournaments.  Instead they use the term "postseason" as the title of the official elimination tournament held after the conclusion of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Major League Baseball schedule|regular season]].  Since the {{mlby|2012|disp=seas}}, it has consisted of a first round single-elimination knockout game between the two wildcards in each league, a best-of-5 second round series called the Division Series, and two rounds of best-of-seven series for the League Championship and World Series.

MLB uses a "2-3-2" format for the final two rounds of its postseason tournament. In the Majors, the singular term "playoff" is reserved for the rare situation in which two (or more) teams find themselves tied at the end of the regular season and are forced to have a tiebreaking playoff game (or games) to determine which team will advance to the postseason. Thus, in the majors, a "playoff" is actually ''part of the regular season'' and thus can be called a "[[Pennant playoff]]". However, the plural term "Playoffs" is conventionally used by fans and media to refer to baseball's postseason tournament (and has always been used by [[minor league baseball]] for its own postseason play), not including the "[[World Series]]" (see below), so this article defers to that usage.

MLB is the oldest of the major American professional sports, dating back to the 1870s. As such, it is steeped in tradition. The final series to determine its champion has been called the "[[World Series]]" (originally "World's Championship Series" and then "World's Series") as far back as the National League's contests with the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] during the 1880s. The "Playoffs" determine which two teams play in the "[[World Series]]".

===Taiwan===
{{Main|Taiwan Series}}
Taiwan's playoff is different to many such competitions, due to the league's split-season format. The winners of the first half-season and the winners of the second half-season are eligible to play in the playoffs, but if the best overall team have not won either half season then they qualify into a wild card series against the weaker half-season winner, with the winner of this advancing into the [[Taiwan Series]] to face the other half-season winner. If the first and second half winners are different, but one of them is also the best overall team, then both teams progress directly to the Taiwan Series. Finally, if one team wins both halves of the season then a playoff will take place between the second and third best teams for the right to play them in the Final Series; in this case the team winning both halves of the season will begin the Taiwan Series with an automatic one game advantage.

==Basketball==

===National Basketball Association===
{{main|NBA playoffs}} {{see also|NBA Conference Finals}}
The present organization known as the [[National Basketball Association]], then called the BAA (Basketball Association of America), had its inaugural season in 1946–47. Teams had always have different [[strength of schedule]] from each other; currently, a team plays a team outside its conference twice, a team within its conference but outside its division three or four times, and a team from its own division four times.

In the current system, eight clubs from each of the league's two conferences qualify for the playoffs, with separate playoff brackets for each conference. In the 2002–03 season, the first-round series were expanded from best-of-5 to best-of-7; all other series have always been best-of-7. In all series, home games alternate between the two teams in a 2-2-1-1-1 format.

The 2-3-2 finals format was adopted from the [[1985 NBA Finals|1985 Finals]] to [[2013 NBA Finals|2013]], copying the format that was then in effect in the National Hockey League. Prior to 1985, almost all finals were played in the 2-2-1-1-1 format (although the [[1971 NBA Finals|1971 Finals]] between Milwaukee and Baltimore were on an alternate-home basis, some 1950s finals used the 2-3-2 format, and the [[1975 NBA Finals|1975 Golden State-Washington]] and [[1978 NBA Finals|1978]] and [[1979 NBA Finals|1979]] Seattle-Washington Finals were on a 1-2-2-1-1 basis). Also, prior to the 1980s, [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern]] and [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western]] playoffs were on an alternate-home basis except for series when distance made the 2-2-1-1-1 format more practical. Since [[2014 NBA Finals|2014]], the [[NBA Finals]] restored the original format.

Teams are seeded according to their regular-season record. Through the 2014–15 season, the three division champions and best division runner-up received the top four seeds, with their ranking based on regular-season record. The remaining teams were seeded strictly by regular-season record. However, if the best division runner-up had a better record than other division champs, it could be seeded as high as second. Beginning in 2015–16, the NBA became the first major American league to eliminate automatic playoff berths for division champions; the top eight teams overall in each conference now qualify for the playoffs, regardless of divisional alignment.

===Elsewhere===
Top flight basketball leagues elsewhere also employ a playoff system mimicking the NBA's. However, most leagues are not divided into divisions and conferences, and employ a double round robin format akin to league association football, unlike the NBA where teams are divided into divisions and conferences, which leads to different strengths of schedule per team. Teams are seeded on regular season record. The playoff structure can be single-elimination or a best-of series, with the higher seed, if held the playoffs are not held at a predetermined venue, having the home court advantage.

Aside from the playoffs, some leagues also have a knockout tournament akin to the [[FA Cup]] running in parallel to the regular season. These are not considered playoffs.

In the [[EuroLeague]], after the regular season plays a best-of-5 playoffs in a 2–2–1 format. However, from the semifinals on, it is a single elimination tournament held at a predetermined venue. Still others also have a relegation playoff.

In [[NCAA Division I]] basketball conferences, a playoff or "postseason tournament" is held after the regular season. Most conferences, including all of the "major" basketball conferences ([[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]], [[American Athletic Conference|American]], [[Big East Conference|Big East]], [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]], [[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]], [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]], [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]]), hold their tournaments at a predetermined venue, with all conference teams participating (unless barred due to NCAA sanctions). A few conferences hold early rounds at campus sites and later rounds at a predetermined site. For example, the [[Mid-American Conference]] holds its first-round games at campus sites, but the rest of the tournament in [[Quicken Loans Arena|Cleveland]]. The [[Big South Conference]] holds its first round at campus sites, gives hosting rights for its quarterfinals and semifinals to the regular-season champion, and plays its final at the home court of the top remaining seed. The [[American East Conference]], [[Atlantic Sun Conference|ASUN Conference]], and [[Patriot League]] hold all tournament games at campus sites. A small number of conferences do not invite all of their teams to the conference tournament, with one example being the [[Ivy League]], in which only four of the eight members advance to the tournament (which is at a predetermined site). In many such tournaments, higher seeds are afforded byes. The winners, and some losers which are selected as "at-large bids", play in [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|the NCAA tournament]], which is also single-elimination and held at predetermined venues.

In the [[WNBA Playoffs]], the league's best 8 teams, regardless of conference alignment, compete, and are seeded based on their regular-season records. The top two seeds get double byes and the next two seeds first-round byes. The first two rounds are one-off knockout games, and the league semifinals &amp; Finals are best-of-5 on a 2-2-1 basis.

==Canadian football==
In the [[Canadian Football League]], the playoffs begin in November. After the regular season, the top team from each division has an automatic home game berth in the Division Final, and a bye week during the Division Semifinal. The second-place team from each division hosts the third-place team in the Division Semifinal, unless the fourth-place team from the opposite division finishes with a better record.  This "crossover rule" does not come into play if the teams have identical records—there are no tiebreakers. While the format means that it is possible for two teams in the same division to play for the [[Grey Cup]], so far only two crossover teams have won the divisional semifinal game. The winners of each Division's Semifinal game then travel to play the first place teams in the Division Finals. Since 2005, the Division Semifinals and Division Finals have been sponsored by [[Scotiabank]] and are branded as the "Scotiabank East Championship" and "Scotiabank West Championship".&lt;ref name="CFL.ca 2005-08-08"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/2005/08/08/partnership_of_champions/|title=Partnership of champions|accessdate=|publisher=CFL.ca|date=8 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two division champions then face each other in the Grey Cup game, which is held on the third or fourth Sunday of November.

The [[Edmonton Eskimos]] are notable for qualifying for the CFL playoffs every year from [[1972 CFL season|1972]] to [[2005 CFL season|2005]], a record in North American pro sports. The Eskimos are also notable for being the first crossover team to ever win the divisional semifinal game.

==Hockey==
===National Hockey League===
{{main|Stanley Cup playoffs}} {{see also|NHL Conference Finals}}
The [[National Hockey League]] playoff system is an elimination tournament competition for the [[Stanley Cup]], consisting of four rounds of [[Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven series]]. The first three rounds determine which team from each conference will advance to the final round, dubbed the Stanley Cup Final. The winner of that series becomes the NHL and Stanley Cup champion.

Since 2014 the Conference Quarterfinals consists of four match-ups in each conference, based on the seedings division-wise (# 1 vs. # 4, and # 2 vs. # 3). The division winner with the best record in the conference plays the lowest wild-card seed, while the other division winner plays the top wild-card seed (wild-card teams, who are de facto 4th seeds, may cross over to another division within the conference). In the Conference Semifinals, the four remaining teams in the conference face each other. In the third round, the Conference Finals, the two surviving teams play each other, with the conference champions proceeding to the Stanley Cup Final.

For the first two rounds, the higher-seeded team has home-ice advantage (regardless of point record). Thereafter, it goes to the team with the better regular season record. In all rounds the team with home-ice advantage hosts Games 1, 2, 5 and 7, while the opponent hosts Games 3, 4 and 6 (Games 5–7 are played "if necessary").

===Kontinental Hockey League===
The [[Kontinental Hockey League]], based in Russia and including teams from several nearby countries, operates a playoff system similar to that of the NHL, also consisting of four rounds of single-elimination [[Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven series]]. The first three rounds determine which team from each conference will advance to the final round, dubbed the Gagarin Cup Finals. The winner of that series becomes the KHL and [[Gagarin Cup]] champion.

Like the NHL, the Conference Quarterfinals consists of four match-ups in each conference. The winner of each division receives one of the top two seeds in its conference; the others are based on regular-season record. Unlike the NHL, divisional alignment plays no added role in playoff seeding—all teams are seeded solely within their conference. Playoff pairings are based on seeding number within the conference (# 1 vs. # 8, # 2 vs. # 7, # 3 vs. # 6, and # 4 vs. # 5). The division winner with the best record in the conference plays the lowest wild-card seed, while the other division winner plays the next-lowest seed (wild-card teams, who are de facto 4th seeds, may cross over to another division within the conference). The playoff pairings are reseeded after the first round (a feature that was once used in the NHL, but now abandoned). Therefore, the Conference Semifinals feature the top remaining seed in the conference playing the lowest remaining seed, and the two other first-round survivors playing one another. In the third round, the Conference Finals, the two surviving teams play each other, with the conference champions proceeding to the Gagarin Cup Finals.

For the first two rounds, the higher-seeded team has home-ice advantage (regardless of point record). Thereafter, it goes to the team with the better regular season record. In all rounds the team with home-ice advantage hosts Games 1, 2, 5 and 7, while the opponent hosts Games 3, 4 and 6 (Games 5–7 are played "if necessary").

===Elite Ice Hockey League===
In the United Kingdom, the [[Elite Ice Hockey League]] playoffs are an elimination tournament where the draw is based on the finishing position of teams in the league. Of the 10 teams which compete, the top 8 qualify for the playoffs. The first round (the quarter-finals) are played over two legs (home and away) where the team who finished in 1st place in the regular season plays the team which finished 8th, 2nd plays 7th and so on, with the aggregate score deciding which team progresses.

The semi-finals and final are held over the course of a single weekend at the National Ice Centre in Nottingham. Each consists of a single game with the losing team being eliminated, with the two semi-final games being played on the  Saturday and the final on the Sunday. There is also a third-place game held earlier on the Sunday between the losing teams from the semi-finals. Unlike in the NHL, the winners of the Elite League playoffs are not considered to be the league champions for that season (that title goes to the team which finishes in first place in the league), rather the playoffs are considered to be a separate competition although being crowned playoff champions is a prestigious accolade nonetheless. The most recent playoff champions are the [[Sheffield Steelers]].

==NASCAR==
[[NASCAR]] implemented a "playoff" system beginning in 2004, which they coined the "[[NASCAR playoffs|Chase for the NEXTEL Cup]]". When first introduced, only NASCAR's [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|top series]] used the system, although the other two national racing series (currently known as the [[Xfinity Series]] and the [[Camping World Truck Series]]) have since adopted similar systems. One unique feature of the Nascar playoffs is that the non-qualifying drivers continue to compete alongside the playoff drivers: the qualifying drivers merely have their championship points reset one or more times during the playoffs to figures so high that no non-qualifying driver could ever catch them.

There are actually two different playoffs going on at the end of the season in each series: one for the drivers and another "[[List of NASCAR points scoring systems|owner's points]]" playoff for the racing teams.  Only one multi-driver team has ever won the Cup series owner's point championship: in 2015, Kyle Busch won the championship after missing the first 11 races of the season due to injury; 3 other drivers drove the #18 car during his absence.  Because of the way the playoffs were structured that year, however, both he and his #18 team won their respective championships with 5043 points.  There have been two cases where a playoff driver failed to enter every playoff race.  In 2005, [[Kurt Busch]] was fired by [[Roush Racing]] with two races left in the season.  Busch finished 10th out of 10 Chase drivers, but [[Kenny Wallace]] stepped in to drive the #97 car to an 8th-place finish in the owner's points race.  In 2012, [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] missed two  playoff races due to injury.  [[Regan Smith]] drove the #88 car for two races, including a top-10 finish at Kansas Speedway.  In that case, Smith's 43 additional championship points on top of Earnhardt's 2,245 were not enough to pull the #88 team out of 12th place out of 12 playoff contenders. 

In the original version of the Chase (2004–2006), following the 26th race of the season, all drivers in the top 10 and any others within 400 points of the leader got a spot in the 10-race playoff. Like the current system, drivers in the Chase had their point totals adjusted. However, it was based on the number of points at the conclusion of the 26th race. The first-place driver in the standings led with 5,050 points; the second-place driver started with 5,045. Incremental five-point drops continued through 10th place with 5,005 points.

The first major change to the Chase was announced by NASCAR chairman and CEO [[Brian France]] on January 22, 2007. After 26 races, the top 12 drivers advanced to contend for the points championship and points were reset to 5000. Each driver within the top 12 received an additional 10 points for each win during the "regular season", or first 26 races, thus creating a seeding based on wins. As in previous years, the Chase consisted of 10 races and the driver with the most points at the conclusion of the 10 races was the [[Sprint Cup Series|NEXTEL Cup Series]] Champion. Under the points system then in use, drivers could earn 5 bonus points for leading the most laps, and 5 bonus points for leading a single lap.
Brian France explained why NASCAR made the changes to the chase:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The adjustments taken [Monday] put a greater emphasis on winning races. Winning is what this sport is all about. Nobody likes to see drivers content to finish in the top 10. We want our sport -- especially during the Chase -- to be more about winning."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beginning with the [[2008 in NASCAR|2008 season]], the playoff became known as the "Chase for the Sprint Cup" due to the NEXTEL/[[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] merger.

The next format of the Chase was announced by France on January 26, 2011, along with several other changes, most significantly to the points system. After 26 races, 12 drivers still advanced to the Chase, but the qualifying criteria changed, as well as the number of base points that drivers received at the points reset.

Under this system. only the top 10 drivers in points automatically qualified for the Chase. They were joined by two "wild card" qualifiers, specifically the two drivers ranked from 11th through 20th in points who had the most race wins (with tiebreakers used if needed to select exactly two qualifiers). These drivers then had their base points reset to 2,000 instead of the previous 5,000, reflecting the greatly reduced points available from each race (a maximum of 48 for the race winner, as opposed to a maximum of 195 in the pre-2011 system). After the reset, the 10 automatic qualifiers received 3 bonus points for each race win, while the wild card qualifiers received no bonus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/news/110128/chase-format/index.html |title=10-race Chase for the Cup crowns series champ |work=NASCAR 101 |publisher=NASCAR |date=January 28, 2011 |accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 2014. even more radical changes to the Chase were announced; these took effect for the 2014 season:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/1/30/chase-for-the-nascar-sprint-cup-championship-format-changes.html |title=NASCAR Announces Chase for the Sprint Cup Format Change |publisher=NASCAR |date=January 30, 2014 |accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The number of drivers qualifying for the Chase was expanded to 16, with this group officially called the NASCAR Sprint Cup Chase Grid.
* The Chase Grid is now selected primarily on the basis of race wins during the first 26 races (also known as the "regular season"). If fewer than 16 drivers win races. remaining spots on the Chase Grid are filled in order of regular-season drivers' points. Note that the basic point system has not changed from 2013.
* The Chase is now divided into four rounds. After each of the first three rounds, the four Chase Grid drivers with the fewest season points are eliminated from the Grid and championship contention. Any driver on the Chase Grid who wins a race in the first three rounds automatically advances to the next round. Also, all drivers eliminated from the Chase have their points readjusted to the regular-season points scheme, although they retain their points total from the last Chase round in which they participated.
** Challenger Round (races 27–29)
*** Begins with 16 drivers, each with 2,000 points plus a 3-point bonus for each win in the first 26 races.
** Contender Round (races 30–32)
*** Begins with 12 drivers, each with 3,000 points.
** Eliminator Round (races 33–35)
*** Begins with eight drivers, each with 4,000 points.
** NASCAR Sprint Cup Championship (final race)
*** The last four drivers in contention for the season title start the race at 5,000 points, with the highest finisher in the race winning the Cup Series title.

The Chase for the Sprint Cup has been generally panned since its inception, as many drivers and owners have criticized the declining importance of the first 26 races, as well as very little change in schedule from year to year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/430547-nascars-chase-fixer-upper-or-just-demolish-it|title=NASCAR's Chase:  Fixer-Upper or Just Demolish It?|first=Sandra |last= MacWatters |publisher=Bleacher Report|date = 5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Fisher, the director of the NASCAR Research and Development Center, has been one of the more vocal critics of the system, saying that "Due to NASCAR having the same competitors on the track week in, week out, a champion emerges. In stick-and-ball sports, every team has a different schedule, so head-to-head series are necessary to determine a champion. That does not apply to auto racing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://hometracks.nascar.com/nascar_101/NASCAR_Research_and_Development_Center |deadurl= yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110414135301/http://hometracks.nascar.com:80/nascar_101/NASCAR_Research_and_Development_Center |archivedate = 14 April 2011|title = NASCAR Research &amp; Development Center|work = NASCAR Home Tracks|date = 17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASCAR extended the Chase format to its other two national touring series, the [[Xfinity Series]] and [[Camping World Truck Series]], beginning in 2016. The formats used in the two lower series are broadly similar to the format used in the Cup Series, but have some significant differences:&lt;ref name="2016 Chase"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2016/1/19/nascar-official-release-xfinity-truck-series-changes-championship-chase.html |title=Chase Format Extended to Xfinity, Camping World Truck Series |publisher=NASCAR |date=January 19, 2016 |accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Xfinity and Truck Series Chases are held over three rounds, instead of four in the Cup Series.
* Each of the first two rounds of the Xfinity and Truck Series Chases consists of two races (compared to three in the first three rounds of the Cup Series Chase).
* The Xfinity Series Dash 4 Cash, consisting of four short events with the winners receiving cash prizes, has been incorporated into that series' Chase. A driver who wins two Dash 4 Cash events is considered as having one regular race win, which essentially qualifies the driver for the Chase even if he or she wins no other race during the season. However, there is no points bonus for Dash 4 Cash wins.
* Instead of the 16 drivers who qualify in the Cup Series, 12 drivers qualify in the Xfinity Series and 8 in the Truck Series.
* Four drivers are eliminated at the end of each of the first two rounds of the Xfinity Series Chase, as in the Cup Series. The Truck Series Chase eliminates only two drivers at the end of its first two rounds. All formats end with four drivers eligible to win the season title entering the season's last race.
* The rounds of the Chase now have a standard name across all series. The rounds leading up to the final race are now officially called "Round of X", where "X" is the number of drivers eligible for the season title. The drivers in the final race that are still eligible for the season title are called the "Championship 4".

Starting with the 2017 season, NASCAR abandoned the term "Chase", instead calling its final series the "playoffs".

==Rugby league==

===National Rugby League===
Play-offs are used to decide the premiers of the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) in Australasia, where they are known as ''finals'' (also as ''semi finals'' or ''semis'') – as in Australian rules football, the participating teams only come from within a single division, and the tournament is staged as single matches rather than a series. Currently, in the NRL, eight teams qualify for the finals; starting with the 2012 season, the system was changed from the [[McIntyre Final Eight System|McIntyre Final Eight]] to the [[AFL final eight system|same system used by the AFL]].

Previously, the term play-off was used in the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership|NSWRL]] competition to describe matches which were played as tie breakers to determine qualification for the finals series. Since 1995, points differential decides finals' qualification and play-offs are no longer held.

===Super League===
{{Main|Super League play-offs}}
The European [[Super League]] [[rugby league]] competition has used a play-off system to decide its champion since 1998. The original play-off format featured the [[Super League play-offs#Top five|top five highest-ranked teams]] after the regular season rounds.  Starting in 2002, the play-offs added an extra spot to allow [[Super League play-offs#Top six|the top six]] to qualify. With the addition of two new teams for the [[Super League XIV|2009 season]], the play-offs expanded to [[Super League play-offs|eight teams]]. The next format, scrapped after [[Super League XIX|the 2014 season]], worked as follows:

'''Week One'''
*Qualifying Play Off 1: 1st vs 4th ''(winner receives a bye to week three)''
*Qualifying Play Off 2: 2nd vs 3rd ''(winner receives a bye to week three)''
*Elimination Play Off 1: 5th vs 8th ''(loser goes out)''
*Elimination Play Off 2: 6th vs 7th ''(loser goes out)''

'''Week Two'''
*Preliminary Semi Final 1: QPO 1 Loser vs EPO 1 Winner
*Preliminary Semi Final 2: QPO 2 Loser vs EPO 2 Winner

'''Week Three'''
*Qualifying Semi Final 1: QPO 1 Winner vs PSF 1 ''or'' PSF 2 Winner *
*Qualifying Semi Final 2: QPO 2 Winner vs PSF 1 ''or'' PSF 2 Winner *

'''Week Four'''
* Grand Final: Winners of Qualifying Semi-Finals meet at [[Old Trafford]]

''* Opponents decided by the QPO winner (in Week 1) that finished higher in the regular season

Beginning in [[Super League XX|2015]], the Super League season was radically reorganised, and more closely integrated with that of the second-level [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]]. Following a home-and-away season of 22 matches, the top eight clubs in Super League now enter a single round-robin mini-league known as the [[Rugby League Super 8s|Super 8s]], with the top four teams after that stage entering a [[Shaughnessy playoff system|knockout play-off]] to determine the champion. The four bottom teams in Super League at the end of the home-and-away season are joined by the top four from the Championship after its home-and-away season. These eight teams play their own single-round-robin mini-league known as [[The Qualifiers]]; at its end, the top three teams are assured of places in the next season's Super League, with the fourth- and fifth-place teams playing a single match billed as the "[[Million Pound Game]]", with the winner also playing in Super League in the following season.

===Other leagues===
The two tiers directly below Super League, the [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]] and [[League 1 (rugby league)|League 1]] (the latter of which was known as Championship 1 from 2009–2014)—formerly the National Leagues until the 2009 addition of [[Toulouse Olympique|a French club]] to the previously all-British competition—used the old top six system to determine which teams were promoted between its levels through the 2014 season. After that season, both leagues abandoned the top six system. Before the 2008 season, when Super League established a [[2009–11 Super League licences|franchising system]] and ended automatic promotion and relegation in Super League, the National Leagues also used this system to determine the team that earned promotion to Super League. The top six system involved the following:

Week One
* Elimination Semi-final A: 3rd vs 6th (4th vs 7th in Championship 1)
* Elimination Semi-final B: 4th vs 5th (5th vs 6th in Championship 1)

Week Two
* Elimination Final: Winners of Elimination Semi-final A vs Winners of Elimination Semi-final B
* Qualification Match: 1st vs 2nd (2nd vs 3rd in Championship 1)

Week Three
* Final Qualifier: Winners of Elimination Final vs Losers of Qualification Match

Week Four
* Grand Final: Winners of Qualification Match vs Winners of Final Qualifier (in Super League, at Old Trafford)

Since 2015, all clubs in Super League and the Championship play a 22-match home-and-away season. Upon the end of the home-and-away season, the clubs will split into three leagues, with two of them including Championship clubs. As previously noted, the Super 8s will feature the top eight Super League sides. The second league, The Qualifiers, will include the bottom four clubs from Super League and the top four from the Championship, whilst the third will feature the remaining eight Championship sides. The bottom two leagues will begin as single round-robin tournaments. In The Qualifiers, the top three sides will either remain in or be promoted to Super League, with the fourth- and fifth-place teams playing the aforementioned "Million Pound Game" for the final Super League place. In the third league, the sides compete for the Championship Shield, with the top four teams after the round-robin phase entering a knockout playoff for the Shield. The bottom two teams are relegated to League 1.

League 1 currently conducts a 15-match, single round-robin regular season. At that time, the league splits in two. The top eight clubs play in their own Super 8s, also contested as a single round robin. At the end of the Super 8s, the top club earns the season title and immediate promotion to the Championship. The second- through fifth-place clubs contest a knockout playoff for the second place in the Championship. The bottom eight clubs play their own single round-robin phase; at its end, the top two teams play a one-off match for the League 1 Shield.

==Rugby union==

===England===

==== Premiership ====
In the [[Premiership Rugby|Gallagher Premiership]], the top four qualify for the play-offs, where they are not referred to by that name. The tournament is a [[Shaughnessy playoff system|Shaughnessy playoff]]: the team that finished first after the league stage plays the team that finished fourth, while the team that finished second plays the team that finished third in the Semi-Finals, with the higher-ranked team having home advantage. The winners of these semi-finals qualify for the Premiership Final at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]], where the winner will be champions of the league.

====Championship====
Through the 2016–17 season, the second-level [[RFU Championship]] used play-offs—but unlike the Premiership, the Championship officially used the term "play-offs". At the end of the league stage, top teams advanced to a series of promotion play-offs. From the first season of the Championship in [[2009–10 RFU Championship|2009–10]] to [[2011–12 RFU Championship|2011–12]], the top eight teams advanced; from [[2012–13 RFU Championship|2012–13]] through to [[2016–17 RFU Championship|2016–17]], the top four advanced. A relegation play-off involving the bottom four teams existed through the 2011–12 season, but was scrapped from 2012–13 on.

The original promotion play-offs divided the eight teams into two groups of four each, with the teams within each group playing a home-and-away mini-league. The top two teams in each group advanced to a knockout phase. In 2010, the semi-finals were one-off matches; in 2011, they became two-legged. The top team in each pool played the second-place team from the other group in the semi-finals; the winners advanced to the two-legged final, where the ultimate winner earned promotion to the Premiership (assuming that the team met the minimum criteria for promotion).

In the first year of the play-offs in 2010, all eight teams started equal. After that season, it was decided to reward teams for their performance in league play. in 2011 and 2012, the top two teams at the end of the league stage carried over 3&amp;nbsp;competition points to the promotion play-offs; the next two teams carried over 2; the next two carried over 1; and the final two teams carried over none. (Points were earned using the standard [[rugby union bonus points system|bonus points system]].)

The relegation play-offs, like the first stage of the promotion play-offs, were conducted as a home-and-away league, with the bottom team at the end of league play relegated to [[National League 1]]. As with the 2010 promotion play-offs, that season's relegation play-offs started all teams equal. in 2011 and 2012, each team in the relegation play-offs carried over 1&amp;nbsp;competition point for every win in the league season.

Beginning with the 2012–13 season, the pool stage of the promotion playoffs was abolished, with the top four sides directly entering the semi-finals. The format of the knockout stage remained unchanged from 2012, with two-legged semi-finals followed by a two-legged final. At the other end of the table, the bottom club is now automatically relegated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/18102034 |title=Championship: RFU to abolish play-off pool stages |publisher=''BBC Sport'' |date=2012-05-17 |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective with the 2017–18 season, the promotion play-offs were scrapped for a minimum of three seasons, to be replaced with automatic promotion for the club finishing atop the league at the end of the home-and-away season (provided said club meets minimum Premiership standards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.premiershiprugby.com/news/play-off-system-removed-from-greene-king-ipa-championship-from-next-season/ |title=Play-off system removed from Greene King IPA Championship from next season |publisher=Premiership Rugby Limited |date=3 March 2017 |accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
The highest level of French rugby union, the [[Top 14]], expanded its playoffs starting with the [[2009–10 Top 14 season|2009–10 season]] from a four-team format to six teams. In the new system, the top two teams after the double round-robin season receive first-round byes. The first-round matches involve the third- through sixth-place teams, bracketed so that 3 hosts 6 and 4 hosts 5. The winners then advance to face the top two teams in the semifinals, which are held at nominally neutral sites (a traditional feature in the French playoffs)—although in the [[2011–12 Top 14 season|2011–12 season]], the semifinals were held at [[Stadium Municipal|Stadium de Toulouse]], occasionally used as a "big-game" venue by traditional Top 14 power [[Stade Toulousain]]. The winners of these semifinals qualify for the final at [[Stade de France]] (though in 2016, the final was at [[Camp Nou]] in [[Barcelona]] due to conflict with [[UEFA Euro 2016]]), where the winner will be champions of the league and receive the [[Bouclier de Brennus]]. Before 2009–10, the playoffs format was identical to that of the English Premiership with the exception of neutral sites for the semifinals.

Beginning in [[2017–18 Top 14 season|2017–18]], only the bottom club is automatically relegated to [[Rugby Pro D2]]. The second-from-bottom Top 14 side plays a one-off match against the runner-up of the Pro D2 playoffs for the final place in the next Top 14 season.

Pro D2 adopted the Top 14 playoff system effective in [[2017–18 Rugby Pro D2 season|2017–18]], though with all matches held at the higher seed's home field. The playoff champion earns automatic promotion; as noted above, the runner-up enters a one-off match for potential promotion to Top 14. Previously, Pro D2 used a four-team playoff, involving the second- through fifth-place teams, to determine the second of two teams promoted to the next season's Top 14, with the regular-season champions earning automatic promotion. Under this system, the promotion semifinals were held at the home fields of the second- and third-place teams, and the promotion final was held at a neutral site.

=== Pro14 ===
The [[Pro14]], originally known as the Celtic League and later as Pro12, adopted a four-team playoff starting with the [[2009–10 Celtic League|2009–10 season]]. The format was essentially identical to that of the English Premiership. Through the 2013–14 season, the final was held at a ground chosen by the top surviving seed, with the caveat that the venue must have a capacity of at least 18,000. In [[2012–13 Pro12|2012–13]], top seed [[Ulster Rugby|Ulster]] could not use its regular home ground of [[Ravenhill Stadium|Ravenhill]] for that reason (the ground was later expanded to meet the requirement). The league changed to using a predetermined site for its championship final in [[2014–15 Pro12|2014–15]].

With the addition of two South African sides in [[2017–18 Pro14|2017–18]], the league split into two conferences and expanded its playoffs to six teams. The top team of each conference earns a bye into the semifinals, where they will host the winners of matches between the second- and third-place teams from the other conferences (with the second-place team hosting the third-place team from the opposite conference).

=== New Zealand ===
Both domestic competitions in New Zealand rugby — the semi-professional [[Mitre 10 Cup]] (formerly Air New Zealand Cup and ITM Cup) and the nominally amateur [[Heartland Championship]] — use a playoff system to determine their champions, although the term "playoff" is also not used in New Zealand, with "finals" used instead.

==== Air New Zealand/ITM/Mitre 10 Cup ====
In the [[2006 Air New Zealand Cup]], the first season of the revamped domestic structure in that country, the top six teams after Round One of the competition automatically qualified for the finals, officially known as Round Three. Their relative seeding was determined by their standings at the end of the Top Six phase of Round Two. The teams that finished below the top six entered repechage pools in Round Two, with the winner of each pool taking up one of the final two finals slots. The seventh seed was the repechage winner with the better record, and the eighth seed was the other repechage winner.

From [[2007 Air New Zealand Cup|2007]] onward, the former Rounds One and Two were collapsed into a single pool phase of play in which all teams participated. In 2007 and [[2008 Air New Zealand Cup|2008]], the top eight teams advanced to the playoffs; in what was intended to be the final season of the Air New Zealand Cup format in [[2009 Air New Zealand Cup|2009]], the Shaughnessy format was used, with the top four advancing to the finals. The [[New Zealand Rugby Union]] (NZRU) ultimately decided to stay with the previous format for the rebranded [[2010 ITM Cup]], with the same four-team playoff as in 2009. Starting in [[2011 ITM Cup|2011]], the NZRU split the ITM Cup into two seven-team leagues, the top-level Premiership and second-level Championship, and instituted promotion and relegation in the ITM Cup (a feature of the country's former [[National Provincial Championship]]). The competition was renamed the Mitre 10 Cup in 2016.

The playoffs in each season format have consisted of a single-elimination tournament. The teams are bracketed in the normal fashion, with the higher seed receiving home-field advantage. In 2007 and 2008, the playoff was rebracketed after the quarterfinals, with the highest surviving seed hosting the lowest surviving seed and the second-highest surviving seed hosting the third surviving seed. The winners of these semifinals qualify for the Cup Final (2006–10) or Premiership/Championship Final (2011–), held at the home ground of the higher surviving seed. From 2011 onward, the winner of the Championship Final is promoted to the Premiership, replacing that league's bottom team.

Because the 2011 season ran up against that year's [[2011 Rugby World Cup|Rugby World Cup]] in New Zealand, the competition window was truncated, with only the top two teams in each division advancing to the final match. The Shaughnessy finals series returned to both divisions in 2012, and is currently used in non-World Cup years.

==== Heartland Championship ====
In the [[Heartland Championship]], teams play for two distinct trophies — the more prestigious [[Meads Cup]] and the Lochore Cup. The 12 Heartland Championship teams are divided into two pools for round-robin play in Round One, with the top three in each pool advancing to the Meads Cup and the bottom three dropping to the Lochore Cup.

Round Two in both the Meads and Lochore Cups is an abbreviated round-robin tournament, with each team playing only the teams it did not play in Round One. The top four teams in the Meads Cup pool at the end of Round Two advance to the Meads Cup semifinals; the same applies for the Lochore Cup contestants.

The semifinals of both cups are seeded 1 vs 4 and 2 vs 3, with the higher seeds earning home field advantage. The semifinal winners advance to their respective cup final, hosted by the higher surviving seed.

=== Super Rugby ===
Throughout the pre-2011 history of [[Super Rugby]]—both in the Super 12 and Super 14 formats—the competition's organiser, [[SANZAAR|SANZAR]] (renamed SANZAAR in 2016), held a Shaughnessy playoff involving the top four teams. The top two teams on the league ladder each hosted a semifinal, with the top surviving team hosting the final.

In May 2009, SANZAR announced that it would adopt an expanded playoff when the competition added [[Melbourne Rebels|a new Australian team]] for the 2011 season. Through 2015, the Super Rugby playoff involved six teams—the winners of each of three conferences (Australia, New Zealand and South Africa conferences), plus the three non-winners with the most competition points without regard to conference affiliation.

The top two conference winners received a first-round bye; each played at home against the winner of an elimination match involving two of the four other playoff teams. As in the previous system, the final was hosted by the top surviving seed.

Further expansion of the competition in 2016 to 18 teams, with [[Southern Kings|one extra entry]] from South Africa and new teams based in [[Jaguares (Super Rugby)|Argentina]] and [[Sunwolves|Japan]], saw the playoff bracket expand to eight teams. The teams were split into African and Australasian groups, with the Argentine and Japanese teams joining the African group. Each group in turn was divided into two conferences (Australia, New Zealand, Africa 1, Africa 2). Conference winners received the top four playoff seeds, and were joined by the top three remaining Australasian teams and the top remaining team from the African group on table points, again without regard to conference affiliation. The higher seed still hosted all playoff matches, including the final.

With the contraction of the league to 15 teams for 2018, with one Australian and two South African teams being axed, the playoff format changed yet again. The number of conferences was reduced from four to three—Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, with the Argentine team joining the South Africa conference and the Japanese team joining the Australia conference. The playoff will remain at eight teams, with the three conference winners joined by five "wildcards", specifically the top remaining teams without regard to conference affiliation. The conference winners and the top wildcard will host quarterfinals, with all remaining matches hosted by the higher seed.

'''Production leveling''', also known as '''production smoothing''' or – by its Japanese original term – {{nihongo|'''heijunka'''|平準化}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessknowledgesource.com/manufacturing/production_leveling_extended_entry_026155.html Businessknowledgesource.com]&lt;/ref&gt; is a technique for reducing the Mura (Unevenness) which in turn reduces [[Muda (Japanese term)|muda]] (waste). It was vital to the development of production efficiency in the [[Toyota Production System]] and [[lean manufacturing]].  The goal is to produce intermediate goods at a constant rate so that further processing may also be carried out at a constant and predictable rate.

Where demand is constant, production leveling is easy, but where customer demand fluctuates, two approaches have been adopted: 1) ''demand leveling'' and 2) ''production leveling'' through flexible production.

To prevent fluctuations in production, even in outside affiliates, it is important to minimize fluctuation in the final assembly line. Toyota's final assembly line never assembles the same automobile model in a batch. Instead, they level production by assembling a mix of models in each batch&lt;ref&gt;Toyota Production System, Taiichi Ohno, Productivity Press, p 126&lt;/ref&gt; and the batches are made as small as possible.

== Production leveling by volume or by product type or mix ==
Production leveling can refer to leveling by volume, or leveling by product type or mix, although the two are closely related.

=== Leveling by volume ===
If for a family of products that use the same production process there is a demand that varies between 800 and 1,200 units then it might seem a good idea to produce the amount ordered. Toyota's view is that production systems that vary in the required output suffer from [[Mura (Japanese term)|mura]] and [[Muri (Japanese term)|muri]] with capacity being 'forced' in some periods. So their approach is to manufacture at the long-term average demand and carry an inventory proportional to the variability of demand, stability of the production process and the frequency of shipments. So for our case of 800–1,200 units, if the production process were 100% reliable and the shipments once a week, then the production would be with minimum standard inventory of 200 at the start of the week and 1,200 at the point of shipment. The advantage of carrying this inventory is that it can smooth production throughout the plant and therefore reduce process inventories and simplify operations which reduces costs.

=== Leveling by product ===
Most value streams produce a mix of products and therefore face a choice of production mix and sequence. It is here that the discussions on [[economic order quantity|economic order quantities]] take place and have been dominated by [[changeover]] times and the inventory this requires. Toyota's approach resulted in a different discussion where it reduced the time and cost of changeovers so that smaller and smaller batches were not prohibitive and lost production time and quality costs were not significant. This meant that the demand for components could be leveled for the upstream sub-processes and therefore lead time and total inventories reduced along the entire value stream. To simplify leveling of products with different demand levels a related [[Visual Control|visual scheduling]] board known as a [[heijunka box]] is often used in achieving these heijunka style efficiencies. Other [[Production levelling|production leveling]] techniques based on this thinking have also been developed. Once leveling by product is achieved then there is one more leveling phase, that of "[[Just in Sequence]]" where leveling occurs at the lowest level of product production.

The use of production leveling as well as broader [[lean production]] techniques helped [[Toyota Production System|Toyota]] massively reduce vehicle production times as well as inventory levels during the 1980s.

=== Implementation ===
Even Toyota hasn't reached the final stage in this journey, single-piece flows, across all of their processes; indeed they recommend following their journey rather than trying to jump into an intermediate stage. The reason Toyota advocate this is that each production stage is accompanied by adjustments and adaptations to support services to production; if those services are not given these adaptation steps then major issues can arise.

# '''Implement green stream/red stream or fixed sequence, fixed volume''' to establish the entry and exit criteria for products from these streams and establish the supporting disciplines in the support services. The cycle established will produce Every Product Every Cycle (EPEC). This is a specific form of [[Fixed Repeating Schedule]]. Green stream products are those with predictable demand, Red stream products are high value unpredictable demand products.
# '''Faster fixed sequence with fixed volume''' keep the streams the same but use the now established familiarity with the streams to maximise learning and improve speed of production (economies of repetition). This will allow the shortening of the EPEC cycle so that the plant is now producing every product every 2 weeks instead of month and then later on repeating every week. This may require support services to speed up as well.
# '''Fixed sequence with unfixed volume''' keep the stream sequences the same but now phase in allowing actual sales to influence volumes within those sequences. This affects inbound componentry as well as support services. This is a more generalised form of [[Fixed Repeating Schedule]].
# '''Unfixed sequence with fixed volume''' the stream sequences, and EPEC, can now be gradually flexed but move to small fixed batch sizes to make this more manageable.
# '''Unfixed sequence with unfixed volume''' finally move to true single piece flow and pull by reducing batch sizes until they reach one.

== Demand leveling ==
'''Demand leveling''' is the deliberate influencing of demand itself or the demand processes to deliver a more predictable pattern of customer demand. Some of this influencing is by manipulating the product offering, some by influencing the ordering process and some by revealing the [[demand amplification]] induced variability of ordering patterns. Demand levelling does not include influencing activities designed to clear existing stock.

Historically demand leveling evolved as subset of production levelling and has been approached in a variety of ways:

*The first approach to demand levelling involves careful management of the sales pipeline. For this method of demand management it is instructive to look at Toyota in its home market, Japan. Toyota sales teams sell cars door-to-door whereby they build customer profiles and relationships. The sales process is low intensity but includes test drives, financing, insurance and trade-in deals.&lt;ref&gt;The Machine that changed the World, Womack, Jones and Roos, Macmillan Publishing, p183, {{ISBN|0-89256-350-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale itself is by special order placed with their representative. This means that orders can be predicted reasonably accurately in terms of vehicle numbers some way in advance. Finer specific vehicle details may only become known with the order. However, the order is often for delivery in the future so these details can usually be planned before build. Because the customer is getting the exact car they want there is less negotiation around price as indeed the fact that the build is to order removes the incentive of the manufacturer, or their agent, to discount existing stock. The aim of this system is to maximise the revenue from the customer in the long term. This leads to the sales team handling after-sales issues of diverse kinds for an extended period to keep customer loyalty and the relationship which will sell the next car. Between purchases the sales team remain in touch for all aspects of customer satisfaction with their cars including feedback for product design on changing customer preferences in the market. The Japanese market does not have the seasonal, promotional or other demand surges that are a characteristic of Western automotive markets. It is debated, for both markets, whether this is caused by manufacturers' behaviour or whether manufacturers' behaviour is a logical response to it.
*A second approach to demand levelling is by deep understanding of the systems used to order products by retailers and other sellers from manufacturers. Even where this [[supply chain]] is very simple, customer-retailer-manufacturer, it is usually the case that orders are based on some form of [[economic order quantity]] (EOQ) calculation that aggregates actual customer demand over a certain period. This aggregation, and the other clever calculations that may be involved, often obscure the fact that actual demand for a product is close to flat, and for high volume products very close to flat. The demand pulsing effect is created by the ordering process and the more complex it is the greater this effect. The use of [[Point of sale|EPOS]] actual sales data can reveal this effect very clearly.
*A third approach to demand management is to keep finished goods or nearly finished goods in stock to act as a buffer and thus isolate the production facility from actual demand.  This approach is widely used today but its weakness is becoming more and more evident as a growing variety of products is demanded. The cost of making, storing, managing and protecting finished goods stock can grow to be prohibitive depending upon product range and demand variability levels. This usually means that actually whilst stocks are kept they are insufficient to meet the stated aims and so customer dissatisfaction ensues along with distressed sales (reduced price) to eliminate stock levels seen as too high.

===Implementation===

If it is accepted that a large part of demand variability in high volume products can be substantially caused by sales and ordering process artifacts then analysis and leveling can be attempted.

The use of long delay [[supply chain]]s to reduce manufacturing costs often means that production orders are placed long before customer demand can be realistically estimated. The much later arrival of forecast product demand volumes makes demand leveling irrelevant since the issue has now switched to disposal at best price possible products that are already created and possibly paid for. Demand leveling has only proven possible where build times have been made relatively low and production has been made relatively reliable and flexible. Examples of these are fast airborne supply chains (e.g. Apple iPod) or direct to customer selling through web sites allowing late customisation (e.g. [[NIKEiD]] custom shoes) or local manufacture (e.g. [[Timbuk2]] custom courier bags).

Where actual build-delivery times can be brought within the same scale as customer time horizons then effort to modify impulse buying and make it somewhat planned can be successful. Reliable, flexible manufacturing will then mean that low stock levels (if any) do not interfere with customer satisfaction and that incentives to sell what has been produced eliminated.

Where demand follows a predictable pattern, e.g. flat, then regular deliveries of constant amounts can be agreed with variances in actual demand ignored unless it exceeds some agreed trigger level. Where this cannot be agreed then it can be simulated and the benefits gained through [[frequent deliveries]] and a [[Manufacturing supermarket|market location]].

The predictable pattern does not have to be flat and may, for example, be an annual pattern with higher volumes at particular periods. Here again the deliveries can be agreed to follow a simplified but similar pattern, perhaps one delivery volume for six months of the year and another for the other six months.

'''Rostow's Stages of Economic Growth''' model is one of the major historical models of [[economic growth]]. It was published by American economist [[Walt Whitman Rostow]] in 1960. The model postulates that economic growth occurs in five basic stages, of varying length:&lt;ref name="mth"/&gt;

# Traditional society
# Transitional society 
# Take-off
# Drive to technological maturity
# High mass consumption 

Rostow's model is one of the more [[structuralism|structuralist]] models of economic growth, particularly in comparison with the "[[backwardness]]" model developed by [[Alexander Gerschenkron]], although the two models are not mutually exclusive.

Rostow argued that economic take-off must initially be led by a few individual [[economic sector]]s. This belief echoes [[David Ricardo]]'s [[comparative advantage]] thesis and criticizes [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionaries' push for economic self-reliance in that it pushes for the "initial" development of only one or two sectors over the development of all sectors equally. This became one of the important concepts in the [[theory of modernization]] in [[social evolutionism]].

== Overview ==

Below is an outline of Rostow's Five Stages of Growth:
* '''Traditional Society'''
** characterized by subsistence agriculture or [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]]; almost wholly a "primary" sector economy
** limited technology
** Some advancements and improvements to processes, but limited ability for economic growth because of the absence of modern technologies, lack of class or individual economic mobility, with stability prioritized and change seen negatively 
** This is where society generally begins before progressing towards the next stages of growth
** No centralized nations or political systems.
* '''Pre-conditions to "take-off"'''
** External demand for raw materials initiates economic change.
** Development of more productive, commercial agriculture and cash crops not consumed by producers and/or largely exported.
** Widespread and enhanced investment in changes to the physical environment to expand production (i.e. irrigation, canals, ports)
** Increasing spread of technology and advances in existing technologies
** Changing social structure, with previous social equilibrium now in flux
** Individual social mobility begins
** Development of national identity and shared economic interests.
*'''Take-off'''
** Urbanization increases, industrialization proceeds, technological breakthroughs occur.
** "Secondary" (goods-producing) sector expands and ratio of secondary vs. primary sectors in the economy shifts quickly towards secondary.
** Textiles and apparel are usually the first "take-off" industry, as happened in Great Britain's classic "[[Industrial Revolution]]"
** An Example of the Take-off phase is the Agriculture (Green) Revolution in the 1960s.
* '''Drive to Maturity'''
** Diversification of the industrial base; multiple industries expand and new ones take root quickly
** Manufacturing shifts from investment-driven (capital goods) towards consumer durables and domestic consumption
** Rapid development of transportation infrastructure.
** Large-scale investment in social infrastructure (schools, universities, hospitals, etc.)
* '''Age of Mass Consumption'''
** the industrial base dominates the economy; the primary sector is of greatly diminished weight in economy and society
** widespread and normative consumption of high-value consumer goods (e.g. automobiles)
** consumers typically (if not universally), have disposable income, beyond all basic needs, for additional goods
** Urban society (a movement away from rural countrysides to the cities)
*'''Beyond consumption'''
**age of diminishing relative marginal utility as well as an age for durable consumer goods
**large families and Americans feel as if they were born into a society that has high economic security and high consumption 
**a stage where its merely speculation on whether there is further consumer diffusion or what the new generation will bring for growth

Rostow claimed that these stages of growth were designed to tackle a number of issues, some of which he identified himself, writing: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Under what impulses did traditional, agricultural societies begin the process of their modernization? When and how did regular growth become a built-in feature of each society? What forces drove the process of sustained growth along and determined its contours? What common social and political features of the growth process may be discerned at each stage? What forces have determined relations between the more developed and less developed areas; and what relation if any did the relative sequence of growth bear to outbreak of war? And finally where is compound interest taking us? Is it taking us to communism; or to the affluent suburbs, nicely rounded out with social overhead capital; to destruction; to the moon; or where?"&lt;ref name="WWR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MP" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Rostow asserts that countries go through each of these stages fairly linearly, and set out a number of conditions that were likely to occur in [[investment]], [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], and social trends at each state. Not all of the conditions were certain to occur at each stage, however, and the stages and transition periods may occur at varying lengths from country to country, and even from region to region.&lt;ref&gt;Rostow emphasizes in ''Stages'' that "the stages of growth are an arbitrary and limited way of looking at the sequence of modern history: ... to dramatize not merely the uniformities in the sequence of modernization but also—and equally—the uniqueness of each nation's experience."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical Framework ==

Rostow's model is a part of the [[liberal economics|liberal school of economics]], laying emphasis on the efficacy of modern concepts of [[free trade]] and the ideas of [[Adam Smith]]. It disagrees with [[Friedrich List]]'s argument which states that economies which rely on exports of raw materials may get "locked in", and would not be able to diversify, regarding this Rostow's model states that economies may need to depend on raw material exports to finance the development of industrial sector which has not yet of achieved superior level of competitiveness in the early stages of take-off. Rostow's model does not disagree with [[John Maynard Keynes]] regarding the importance of government control over domestic development which is not generally accepted by some ardent free trade advocates. The basic assumption given by Rostow is that countries want to modernize and grow and that society will agree to the [[Economic materialism|materialistic]] norms of economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewishistoricalsociety.com/wiki/tiki-print_article.php?articleId=66 |title=Rostow's Stages of Development vs. Self- Sufficiency |publisher=Lewis historical society |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stages of Development Process ==

=== Traditional Societies ===

An economy in this stage has an unlimited production function which barely attains the minimum level of potential output.  This does not entirely mean that the economy's production level is static.  The output level can still be increased, as there was often a surplus of uncultivated land which can be used for increasing agricultural production. Modern science and technology has yet to be introduced. As a result, these pre-Newtonian societies, unaware of the possibilities to manipulate the external world, rely heavily on manual labor and self-sufficiency to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto|last=Rostow|first=W. W.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1960|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; States and individuals utilize irrigation systems in many instances, but most farming is still purely for subsistence.  There have been technological innovations, but only on ad hoc basis. All of that this can result in increases in output, but never beyond an upper limit which cannot be crossed. Trade is predominantly regional and local, largely done through barter, and the monetary system is not well developed.  Investment's share never exceeds 5% of total economic production.

Wars, famines and epidemics like plague cause initially expanding populations to halt or shrink, limiting the single greatest factor of production: human manual labor.  Volume fluctuations in trade due to political instability are frequent; historically, trading was subject to great risk and transport of goods and raw materials was expensive, difficult, slow and unreliable. The manufacturing sector and other industries have a tendency to grow but are limited by inadequate scientific knowledge and a "backward" or highly traditionalist frame of mind which contributes to low labour productivity. In this stage, some regions are entirely self-sufficient.

In settled agricultural societies before the Industrial Revolution, a hierarchical social structure relied on near-absolute reverence for tradition, and an insistence on obedience and submission.  This resulted in concentration of political power in the hands of landowners in most cases; everywhere, family and lineage, and marriage ties, constituted the primary social organization, along with religious customs, and the state only rarely interacted with local populations and in limited spheres of life.  This social structure was generally feudalistic in nature.  Under modern conditions, these characteristics have been modified by outside influences, but the least developed regions and societies fit this description quite accurately..

=== Pre-conditions for Take-off ===

In the second stage of economic growth the economy undergoes a process of change for building up of conditions for growth and take off. [[Walt Whitman Rostow|Rostow]] said that these changes in society and the economy had to be of fundamental nature in the socio-political structure and production techniques.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt; This pattern was followed in Europe, parts of Asia, the Middle East and Africa. There is also a second or third pattern in which he said that there was no need for change in socio-political structure because these economies were not deeply caught up in older, traditional social and political structures. The only changes required were in economic and technical dimensions.  The nations which followed this pattern were in North America and Oceania (New Zealand and Australia).

There are three important dimensions to this transition: firstly, the shift from an agrarian to an industrial or manufacturing society begins, albeit slowly. Secondly, trade and other commercial activities of the nation broaden the market's reach not only to neighboring areas but also to far-flung regions, creating international markets. Lastly, the surplus attained should not be wasted on the [[conspicuous consumption]] of the land owners or the state, but should be spent on the development of industries, infrastructure and thereby prepare for self-sustained growth of the economy later on. Furthermore, agriculture becomes commercialized and mechanized via technological advancement; shifts increasingly towards cash or export-oriented crops; and there is a growth of agricultural entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brett Wallace |url=http://www.slideshare.net/geographyalltheway/ib-geography-develpent-rostow-model |title=IB Geography: Development: Rostow Model |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2008-02-02 |accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategic factor is that investment level should be above 5% of the [[national income]]. This rise in investment rate depends on many sectors of the economy. According to [[Walt Whitman Rostow|Rostow]] capital formation depends on the productivity of agriculture and the  creation of social overhead capital.  Agriculture plays a very important role in this transition process as the surplus quantity of the produce is to be utilized to support an increasing urban population of workers and also becomes a major exporting sector, earning foreign exchange for continued development and capital formation. Increases in agricultural productivity also lead to expansion of the domestic markets for manufactured goods and processed commodities, which adds to the growth of investment in the industrial sector.

Social overhead capital creation can only be undertaken by government, in Rostow's view.  Government plays the driving role in development of social overhead capital as it is rarely profitable, it has a long gestation period, and the pay-offs accrue to all economic sectors, not primarily to the investing entity; thus the private sector is not interested in playing a major role in its development.

All these changes effectively prepare the way for "take-off" only if there is basic change in attitude of society towards risk taking, changes in working environment, and openness to change in social and political organisations and structures.
According to Rostow, the preconditions to take-off begins from an external intervention by more developed and advanced societies, which "set in motion ideas and sentiments which initiated the process by which a modern alternative to the traditional society was constructed out of the old culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seligso|first=Mitchell A.|title=The Five Stages of Growth W.W. Rostow|journal=Development and Underdevelopment: The Political Economy of Global Inequality|date=|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-conditions of take-off closely track the historic stages of the (initially) British Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="rd"/&gt; 

Referring to the '''graph''' of savings and investment, notably, there is a steep increase in the rate of savings and investment from the stage of "Pre Take-off" till "Drive to Maturity:" then, following that stage, the growing rate of savings and investment moderates.  This initial and accelerating steep increase in savings and investment is a pre-condition for the economy to reach the "Take-off" stage and far beyond.

=== Take-off ===

This stage is characterized by dynamic economic growth. As Rostow suggests, all is premised on a sharp stimulus (or multiple stimuli) that is/are any or all of economic, political and technological change. The main feature of this stage is rapid, self-sustained growth.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rd"/&gt; Take-off occurs when [[List of recognized economic sectors|sector]] led growth becomes common and society is driven more by economic processes than traditions. At this point, the norms of economic growth are well established and growth becomes a nation's "second nature" and a shared goal.&lt;ref name="mth"/&gt; In discussing the take-off, Rostow is noted to have adopted the term "transition", which describes the process of a traditional economy becoming a modern one. After take-off, a country will generally take as long as fifty to one hundred years to reach the mature stage according to the model, as occurred in countries that participated in the Industrial Revolution and were established as such when Rostow developed his ideas in the 1950s.

Per Rostow there are three main requirements for take-off:&lt;blockquote&gt;1. The rate of productive investment should rise from approximately 5% to over 10% of national income or net national product&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2. The development of one or more substantial manufacturing sectors, with a high rate of growth;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;3. The existence or quick emergence of a political, social and institutional framework which exploits the impulses to expansion in the modern sector and the potential external economy effects of the take-off.&lt;ref name="WWR" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;The third requirement implies that the needed capital must be mobilized from domestic resources and steered into the economy, rather than into domestic or state consumption.Industrialization becomes a crucial phenomenon as it helps to prepare the basic structure for structural changes on a massive scale.  Rostow says that this transition does not follow a set trend as there are a variety of different motivations or stimulus which began this growth process.
Take off requires a large and sufficient amount of loanable funds for expansion of the industrial sector which generally come from two sources which are:
#Shifts in income flows by way of taxation, implementation of land reforms and various other fiscal measures.
#Re-investment of profits earned from foreign trade as has been observed in many East Asian countries.  While there are other examples of "Take-off" based on rapidly increasing demand for domestically produced goods for sale in domestic markets, more countries have followed the export-based model, overall and in the recent past.  The US, Canada, Russia and Sweden are examples of domestically based "take-off"; all of them, however, were characterized by massive capital imports and rapid adoption of their trading partners' technological advances.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nvcc.edu/home/nvfordc/econdev/introduction/stages.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040618120100/http://www.nvcc.edu/home/nvfordc/econdev/introduction/stages.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-06-18 |title=Stages of Development |publisher=Nvcc.edu |date=2004-04-22 |accessdate=2014-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This entire process of expansion of the industrial sector yields an increase in rate of return to some individuals who save at high rates and invest their savings in the industrial sector activities. The economy exploit their underutilized natural resources to increase their production.&lt;ref name="mth"/&gt;

[[File:table for take-off.jpg|thumb|300px|Tentative take-off dates&lt;ref name="WWR" /&gt;]]

The take-off also needs a group of entrepreneurs in the society who pursue innovation and accelerate the rate of growth in the economy.  For such an entrepreneurial class to develop, firstly, an ethos of "delayed gratification", a preference for capital accumulation over expenditure, and high tolerance of risk must be present. Secondly, entrepreneurial groups typically develop because they can not secure prestige and power in their society via marriage, via participating in well-established industries, or through government or military service (among other routes to prominence) because of some disqualifying social or legal attribute; and lastly, their rapidly changing society must tolerate unorthodox paths to economic and political power.

The ability of a country to make it through this stage depends on the following major factors:
*Existence of enlarged, sustained effective demand for the product of key sectors.
*Introduction of new productive technologies and techniques in these sectors.
*The society's increasing capacity to generate or earn enough capital to complete the take-off transition.
*Activities in the key sector should induce a chain of growth in other sectors of the economy, that also develop rapidly.

An example of a country in the Take-off stage of development is Equatorial Guinea. It has the largest increases in GDP growth since 1980 and the rate of productive investment has risen from 5% to over 10% of income or product.

In the table note that Take-off periods of different countries are the same as the industrial revolution in those countries.

=== Drive to Maturity ===

After take-off, there follows a long interval of sustained growth known as the stage of drive to maturity. Rostow defines it "as the period when a society has effectively applied the range of modern technology to the bulk of its resources."&lt;ref name="WWR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MP" /&gt; Now regularly growing economy drives to extend modern technology over the whole front of its economic activity. Some 10-20% of the national income is steadily invested, permitting output regularly to outstrip the increase in population. The makeup of the economy changes unceasingly as technique improves, new industries accelerate, older industries level off. The economy finds its place in the international economy: goods formerly imported are produced at home; new import requirements develop, and new export commodities to match them. The leading sectors in an economy will be determined by the nature of resource endowments and not only by technology.

[[File:table for drive to maturity.jpg|thumb|300px|Tentative drive to maturity dates&lt;ref name="WWR" /&gt;]]
On comparing the dates of take-off and drive to maturity, these countries reached the stage of maturity in approximately 60 years.

The structural changes in the society during this stage are in three ways:
* Work force composition in agriculture shifts from 75% of the working population to 20%. The workers acquire greater skill and their wages increase in real terms.
* The character of leadership changes significantly in the industries and a high degree of professionalism is introduced
* Environmental and health cost of industrialization is recognized and policy changes are thus made.
During this stage a country has to decide whether the industrial power and technology it has generated is to be used for the welfare of its people or to gain supremacy over others, or the world ''in toto''.

A prime example of a country in the Drive to Maturity stage is South Africa. It is developing a world-class infrastructure- including a modern transport network, widely available energy, and sophisticated telecommunications facilities. Additionally, the commercial farm sector shed 140,000 jobs, a decline of roughly 20%, in the eleven-year period from 1988 to 1998.

This diversity leads to reduction in poverty rate and increasing standards of living, as the society no longer needs to sacrifice its comfort in order to build up certain sectors.&lt;ref name="rl" /&gt;

=== Age of High Mass Consumption ===

The age of high mass consumption refers to the period of contemporary comfort afforded many western nations, wherein consumers concentrate on [[durable good]]s, and hardly remember the subsistence concerns of previous stages. Rostow uses the Buddenbrooks dynamics metaphor to describe this change in attitude. In [[Thomas Mann]]'s 1901 novel, ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'', a family is chronicled for three generations. The first generation is interested in economic development, the second in its position in society. The third, already having money and prestige, concerns itself with the [[arts]] and [[music]], worrying little about those previous, earthly concerns. So too, in the age of high mass consumption, a society is able to choose between concentrating on [[military]] and [[security]] issues, on [[social equality|equality]] and [[Social welfare|welfare]] issues, or on developing great [[luxuries]] for its upper class. Each country in this position chooses its own balance between these three goals.  There is a desire to develop an egalitarian society and measures are taken to reach this goal.  According to Rostow, a country tries to determine its uniqueness and factors affecting it are its political, geographical and cultural structure and also values present in its society.&lt;ref name="rl" /&gt;

Historically, the United States is said to have reached this stage first, followed by other western European nations, and then Japan in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt;

=== Dark Matter Consumption ===

This step is more of a theoretical speculation by Rostow rather than an analytical step in the process by Rostow.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Beckett, Paul A. ''The Journal of Developing Areas'' 29.2 (1995): 284-86. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals begin having larger families and do not value income as a pre-requisite for more vacation days. Consumer products become more durable and more diverse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; New Americans will behave in a way where the high economic security and level mass consumption is considered normal. Rostow does make the point that it is possible with the large baby boom it could either cause economic issues or dictate an even larger diffusion of consumer goods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With increasing urban and suburban population there will be undoubtedly an increase in consumer goods and services as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Criticism of the model ==

# Rostow is '''historical''' in the sense that the end result is known at the outset and is derived from the historical geography of a developed, bureaucratic society.
# Rostow is '''mechanical''' in the sense that the underlying motor of change is not disclosed and therefore the stages become little more than a classificatory system based on data from developed countries.
# His model is based on American and European history and defines the American norm of high mass consumption as integral to the economic development process of all industrialized societies.
# His model assumes the inevitable adoption of [[Neoliberal]] trade policies which allow the manufacturing base of a given advanced polity to be relocated to lower-wage regions.
# Rostow's model does not apply to the Asian and the African countries as events in these countries are not justified in any stage of his model.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
# The stages are not identifiable properly as the conditions of the take-off and pre take-off stage are very similar and also overlap.
# According to Rostow growth becomes automatic by the time it reaches the maturity stage but Kuznets asserts that no growth can be automatic there is need for push always.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}
# There appear to be two parallel theories of 'take-off' one is that 'take-off' is a sectoral and non-linear notion, and the other is that it is highly aggregative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Itagaki |first=Yoichi |title=Criticism of Rostow's Stage Approach: The Concept of State, System and Type |journal=The Developing Economies |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1–17 |year=1963 |doi=10.1111/j.1746-1049.1963.tb01138.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rostow's thesis''' is biased towards a western model of modernization, but at the time of Rostow the world's only mature economies were in the west, and no controlled economies were in the "era of high mass consumption." The model de-emphasizes differences between sectors in capitalistic vs. communistic societies, but seems to innately recognize that modernization can be achieved in different ways in different types of economies.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Another assumption that Rostow took is of trying to fit economic progress into a linear system. This assumption is questioned due to empirical evidence of many countries making 'false starts' then reaching a degree of progress and change and then slipping back. E.g.: In the case of contemporary [[Russia]] slipping back from high mass consumption to a country in [[Transition economy|transition]].

Another criticism of Rostow's work is that it consideres large countries with a large population ([[Japan]]), with natural resources available at just the right time in its history ([[Coal]] in [[Northern Europe|Northern European countries]]), or with a large land mass ([[Argentina]]). He has little to say and indeed offers little hope for small countries, such as [[Rwanda]], which do not have such advantages. [[Neoliberalism|Neo-liberal economic theory]] to Rostow, and many others, does offer hope to much of the world that economic maturity is coming and the age of high mass consumption is nigh.This does leave a potential "grim meathook future" for the [[wikt:periphery|outliers]], which do not have the resources, political will, or external backing to become [[Competition (companies)|competitive]] with already developed economies.&lt;ref&gt;"Grim Meathook Future" is a quote from new media writer Joshua Ellis{{cite web|url=http://www.zenarchery.com/2005/09/22/full-text-of-the-grim-meathook-future-thing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060329063043/http://www.zenarchery.com/2005/09/22/full-text-of-the-grim-meathook-future-thing/ |archivedate=2006-03-29 |df= }} .&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Dependency theory]])

'''Self-help''' or '''self-improvement''' is a self-guided improvement&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;''APA Dictionary of Physicology'', 1st ed., Gary R. VandenBos, ed., Washington: American Psychological Association, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;—economically, intellectually, or emotionally—often with a substantial [[psychology|psychological]] basis.  Many different self-help group programs exist, each with its own focus, techniques, associated beliefs, proponents and in some cases, [[leadership|leader]]s. Concepts and terms originating in self-help culture and [[Twelve-step program|Twelve-Step]] culture, such as [[Recovery model|recovery]], [[dysfunctional families]], and [[codependency]] have become firmly integrated in mainstream language.&lt;ref&gt;Micki McGee. ''Self-Help, Inc.: Makeover culture in American Life'' (Oxford 2005) p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-help often utilizes publicly available information or [[support groups]], on the Internet as well as in person, where people in similar situations join together.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt; From early examples in self-driven legal practice&lt;ref name="Salerno 2005"&gt;Steve Salerno (2005) ''Sham: How the Self-Help Movement Made America Helpless'', {{ISBN|1-4000-5409-5}} pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; and home-spun advice, the connotations of the word have spread and often apply particularly to [[education]], [[business]], [[psychology]] and [[psychotherapy]], commonly distributed through the popular genre of [[self-help book]]s. According to the ''APA Dictionary of Psychology'', potential benefits of self-help groups that professionals may not be able to provide include friendship, emotional support, experiential knowledge, [[Identity (social science)|identity]], meaningful roles, and a sense of belonging.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;

Groups associated with health conditions may consist of patients and [[caregiver]]s. As well as featuring long-time members sharing [[experience]]s, these health groups can become [[support group]]s and clearing-houses for educational material. Those who help themselves by learning and identifying about health problems can be said to exemplify self-help, while self-help groups can be seen more as peer-to-peer support.

==History==
Within [[classical antiquity]], [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' "opens with moral remonstrances, hammered home in every way that Hesiod can think of."&lt;ref&gt;
John Boardman et al eds., ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (Oxford 1991), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stoics]] offered ethical advice "on the notion of ''eudaimonia''—of well-being, welfare, flourishing."&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; The genre of [[mirror-of-princes writing]]s, which has a long history in [[Greco-Roman]] and Western [[Renaissance]] literature, represents a secular cognate of Biblical wisdom-literature. [[Proverb]]s from many periods, collected and uncollected, embody traditional moral and practical advice of diverse cultures.

The hyphenated [[English compound|compound]] word "self-help" often appeared in the 1800s in a legal context, referring to the doctrine that a party in a dispute has the right to use lawful means on their own initiative to remedy a wrong.&lt;ref&gt;
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2nd edition, 1989) traces legal usage back to at least 1875; whereas it detects "self-help" as a moral virtue as early as 1831 in [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]]'s ''[[Sartor Resartus]]''.
&lt;/ref&gt;

For some, [[George Combe]]'s "''Constitution''" [1828], in the way that it advocated [[personal responsibility]] and the possibility of naturally sanctioned self-improvement through education or proper self-control, largely inaugurated the self-help movement;"&lt;ref&gt;John Van Wyhe, ''Phrenology and the Origins of Victorian Scientific Naturalism'' (2004) p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=October 2015}} In 1841, an essay by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], entitled [[Compensation (essay)|Compensation]], was published suggesting "every man in his lifetime needs to thank his faults" and "acquire habits of ''self-help''" as "our strength grows out of our weakness."&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Waldo Emerson, ''Compensation'' (1841) p. 22 [http://www.emersoncentral.com/compensation.htm Essays]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Smiles]] (1812–1904) published the first self-consciously personal-development "self-help" book—entitled ''[[Self-Help (book)|Self-Help]]''—in 1859. Its opening sentence: "Heaven helps those who help themselves", provides a variation of "God helps them that help themselves", the oft-quoted [[maxim (saying)|maxim]] that had also appeared previously in [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s ''[[Poor Richard's Almanac]]'' (1733–1758). In the 20th century, "[[Dale Carnegie|Carnegie]]'s remarkable success as a self-help author"&lt;ref&gt;Steven Starker, ''Oracle at the Supermarket'' (2002) p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; further developed the genre with ''[[How to Win Friends and Influence People]]'' in 1936. Having failed in several careers, Carnegie became fascinated with success and its link to [[self-confidence]], and his books have since sold over 50 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neil, William J. (2003). ''Business Leaders &amp; Success: 55 Top Business Leaders &amp; How They Achieved Greatness''. [[McGraw-Hill Professional]]. pp. 35–36. {{ISBN|0-07-142680-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, in 1902, [[James Allen (author)|James Allen]] published ''[[As a Man Thinketh]]'', which proceeds from the conviction that "a man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts." Noble thoughts, the book maintains, make for a noble person, whilst lowly thoughts make for a miserable person; and [[Napoleon Hill]]'s ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'' (1937) described the use of repeated [[Optimism|positive thought]]s to attract happiness and wealth by tapping into an "[[Infinity|Infinite]] Intelligence".&lt;ref&gt;Starker, Steven (2002). ''Oracle at the Supermarket: The American Preoccupation With Self-Help Books''. Transaction Publishers. p. 62. {{ISBN|0-7658-0964-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 20th century===

In the final third of the 20th century, "the tremendous growth in self-help publishing...in self-improvement culture"&lt;ref&gt;McGee, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; really took off—something which must be linked to [[postmodernism]] itself—to the way "postmodern subjectivity constructs self-reflexive subjects-in-process."&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Deeds Ermath, ''Sequel to History'' (Princeton 1992) p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably at least, "in the literatures of self-improvement...that crisis of subjecthood is not articulated but enacted—demonstrated in ever-expanding self-help book sales."&lt;ref&gt;McGee, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservative turn of the [[neoliberal]] decades also meant a decline in traditional political activism, and increasing "social isolation; Twelve-Step recovery groups were one context in which individuals sought a sense of community...yet another symptom of the psychologizing of the personal"&lt;ref&gt;
Mcgee, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; to more radical critics. Indeed, "some social theorist{{sic}} have argued that the late-20th century preoccupation with the self serves as a tool of social control: soothing political unrest...[for] one's own pursuit of self-invention."'&lt;ref&gt;McGee, p. 22–3&lt;/ref&gt;

==The market==
Within the context of the market, group and corporate attempts to aid the "seeker" have moved into the "self-help" marketplace, with [[Large Group Awareness Training]]s, LGATs&lt;ref&gt;

These offer more-or-less prepackaged solutions to instruct people seeking their own individual betterment,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} just as "the literature of self-improvement directs the reader to familiar frameworks...what the French ''[[fin de siècle]]'' social theorist [[Gabriel Tarde]] called 'the grooves of borrowed thought'."&lt;ref&gt;McGee, pp. 160–2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statistics ===
At the start of the 21st century, "the self-improvement industry, inclusive of books, seminars, audio and video products, and personal coaching, [was] said to constitute a 2.48-billion dollars-a-year industry"&lt;ref&gt;
Micki McGee, ''Self-Help, Inc.: Makeover Culture in American Life'' (Oxford 2005) p. 11
&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States alone. By 2006, research firm Marketdata estimated the "self-improvement" market in the U.S. as worth more than $9 billion—including [[infomercial]]s, [[mail-order catalog]]s, [[holistic]] institutes, books, [[Compact Cassette|audio cassette]]s, [[motivational speaker|motivation-speaker]] seminars, the [[personal coaching]] market, [[weight loss|weight-loss]] and [[stress management|stress-management]] programs. Marketdata projected that the total market size would grow to over $11 billion by 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

===Self-help and professional service delivery===
Self-help and mutual-help are very different from—though they may complement—service delivery by professionals:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lloyd |first1=R |title=Modeling community-based, self-help mental health rehabilitation . |journal=Australasian Psychiatry : Bulletin of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists |volume=15 Suppl 1 |pages=S99–103 |pmid=18027146 |year=2007 |doi=10.1080/10398560701701296 }}&lt;/ref&gt; note for example the interface between local self-help and International Aid's service delivery model.

Conflicts can and do arise on that interface, however, with some professionals considering that "the twelve-step approach encourages a kind of contemporary version of 19th-century amateurism or enthusiasm in which self-examination and very general social observations are enough to draw rather large conclusions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lennard J. Davis|title=Obsession: A History|location=London|year=2008|pages=171|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z5ATMl1uCCcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Lennard+J.+Davis,+Obsession:+A+History#v=onepage&amp;q=Lennard%20J.%20Davis%2C%20Obsession%3A%20A%20History&amp;f=false|isbn=9780226137797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The rise of self-help culture has inevitably led to boundary disputes with other approaches and disciplines. Some would object to their classification as "self-help" literature, as with "[[Deborah Tannen]]'s denial of the self-help role of her books" so as to maintain her academic credibility, aware of the danger that "writing a book that becomes a popular success...all but ensures that one's work will lose its long-term legitimacy."&lt;ref&gt;McGee, p. 195 and 245&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Placebo]] effects can never be wholly discounted. Thus careful studies of "the power of subliminal self-help tapes...showed that their content had no real effect...But that's not what the participants thought."&lt;ref&gt;Eliot R. Smith/Diane M. Mackie, ''Social Psychology'' (Hove 2007) p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; "If they thought they'd listened to a self-esteem tape (even though half the labels were wrong), they felt that their self-esteem had gone up. No wonder people keep buying subliminal tape: even though the tapes don't work, people think they do."&lt;ref&gt;Smith/Mackie, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; One might then see much of the self-help industry as part of the "skin trades. People need haircuts, massage, dentistry, wigs and glasses, sociology and surgery, as well as love and advice."&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;—a skin trade, "not a profession and a science"&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Its practitioners would thus be functioning as "part of the personal service industry rather than as mental health professionals."&lt;ref&gt;McGee, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; While "there is no proof that twelve-step programs 'are superior to any other intervention in reducing alcohol dependence or alcohol-related problems',"&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bakalar 2006, in Davis, p. 178-9&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time it is clear that "there is something about 'groupishness' itself which is curative."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis''(Penguin 1976) p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for example "smoking increases mortality risk by a factor of just 1.6, while social isolation does so by a factor of 2.0...suggest[ing] an added value to self-help groups such as [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] as surrogate communities."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (London 1996) p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of positive psychologists|Some psychologists]] advocate a [[positive psychology]], and explicitly embrace an empirical self-help philosophy; "the role of positive psychology is to become a bridge between the ivory tower and the main street—between the rigor of academe and the fun of the self-help movement."&lt;ref&gt;Tal Ben-Shachar, "Giving Positive Psychology Away" in C. R. Snyder et al, ''Positive Psychology'' (Sage 2010) p. 503&lt;/ref&gt; They aim to refine the self-improvement field by way of an intentional increase in scientifically sound research and well-engineered models. The division of focus and methodologies has produced several subfields, in particular: general positive psychology, focusing primarily on the study of psychological phenomenon and effects; and [[personal effectiveness]], focusing primarily on analysis, design and implementation of qualitative personal growth. This includes the intentional training of new patterns of thought and feeling. As business strategy communicator [[Don Tapscott]] puts it, "The design industry is something done to us. I'm proposing we each become designers. But I suppose 'I love the way she thinks' could take on new meaning."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_7.html Edge.org question center: Scientific concepts and cognitive toolkits, page 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both self-talk, the propensity to engage in verbal or mental self-directed conversation and thought, and social support can be used as instruments of self-improvement, often by empowering, action-promoting messages. Psychologists have designed series of experiments that are intended to shed light into how self-talk can result in self-improvement. In general, research has shown that people prefer to use second person pronouns over first person pronouns when engaging in self-talk to achieve goals, regulate one’s own behavior, thoughts, or emotions, and facilitate performance.&lt;ref&gt;Gammage, K. L., Hardy, J., &amp; Hall, C. G. (2001). A description of self-talk in exercise. Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 2, 233–247&lt;/ref&gt; If self-talk has the expected effect, then writing about personal problems using language from their friends’ perspective should result in greater amount of motivational and emotional benefits comparing to using language from their own perspective. When you need to finish a difficult task and you are not willing to do something to finish this task, trying to write a few sentence or goals imaging what your friends have told you gives you more motivational resources comparing to you write to yourself. Research done by Ireland and others have revealed that, as expected, when people are writing using many physical and mental words or even typing a standard prompt with these kinds of words, adopting a friend’s perspective while freely writing about a personal challenge can help increase people’s intention to improve self-control by promoting the positivity of emotions such as pride and satisfaction, which can motivate people to reach their goal.&lt;ref&gt;Ireland et al. (2014). A Friend to Myself: Thinking of a Friend in Self-Talk Strengthens Intentions to Improve Self-Control. Manuscript under review.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of self-talk goes beyond the scope of self-improvement for performing certain activities, self-talk as a linguistic form of self-help also plays a very important role in regulating people’s emotions under social stress. First of all, people using non-first-person language tend to exhibit higher level of visual self-distancing during the process of introspection, indicating that using non-first-person pronouns and one’s own name may result in enhanced self-distancing.&lt;ref&gt;Mischowski, D., Kross, E., &amp; Bushman, B. (2012). Flies on the wall are less aggressive: The effect of self-distancing on aggressive affect, cognition, and behavior. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 48, 1187–1191. doi:10.1016/j.jesp.2012.03.012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kross, E. 2014"&gt;Kross, E., Bruehlman-Senecal, E., Park, J., Burson, A., Dougherty, A., Shablack, H., &amp; Ayduk, O. (2014). Self-talk as a regulatory mechanism: How you do it matters. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 106(2), 304&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, this specific form of self-help also has been found can enhance people’s ability to regulate their thoughts, feelings, and behavior under social stress, which would lead them to appraise social-anxiety-provoking events in more challenging and less threatening terms. Additionally, these self-help behaviors also demonstrate noticeable self-regulatory effects through the process of social interactions, regardless of their dispositional vulnerability to social anxiety.&lt;ref name="Kross, E. 2014"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Scholars have targeted self-help claims as misleading and incorrect. In 2005 Steve Salerno portrayed the American self-help movement—he uses the acronym ''SHAM: the Self-Help and Actualization Movement''—not only as ineffective in achieving its goals, but also as socially harmful.&lt;ref name="Salerno 2005"/&gt; "Salerno says that 80 percent of self-help and motivational customers are repeat customers and they keep coming back 'whether the program worked for them or not'."&lt;ref&gt;Vicki Kunkel, ''Instant Appeal'' (2009) p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Others similarly point out that with [[self-help books]] "supply increases the demand... The more people read them, the more they think they need them... more like an addiction than an alliance."&lt;ref&gt;R. J. McAllister, ''Emotion: Mystery or Madness?'' (2007) pp. 156–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-help writers have been described as working "in the area of the ideological, the imagined, the narrativized.... although a veneer of scientism permeates the[ir] work, there is also an underlying armature of moralizing."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Buckley (novelist)|Christopher Buckley]] in his book ''God is My Broker'' asserts: "The only way to get rich from a self-help book is to write one".&lt;ref name=balance&gt;{{cite book|last=Buckley|first=C|title=''God Is My Broker'', ''A Monk-Tycoon Reveals the 7 1/2 Laws of Spiritual and Financial Growth''|year=1998|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-06-097761-0|pages=Page 185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 Gerald M. Rosen reported that people do not gain as much from reading self-help material as people would from the same material received in therapy. In general, he was critical of proliferation of self-help books.&lt;ref&gt;G. Rosen, "Self-help treatment books and the commercialization of psychotherapy", ''American Psychologist'', vol. 42, no. 1, 1987, 46-51&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
[[Kathryn Schulz]] suggests that "the underlying theory of the self-help industry is contradicted by the self-help industry’s existence".&lt;ref&gt;

===Parodies and fictional analogies===
The self-help world has become the target of [[parody|parodies]]. [[Walker Percy]]'s odd genre-busting ''[[Lost in the Cosmos]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Lost in the Cosmos: The Last Self-Help Book''. New York: Farrar, Straus, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; has been described as "a parody of self-help books, a philosophy textbook, and a collection of short stories, quizzes, diagrams, thought experiments, mathematical formulas, made-up dialogue".&lt;ref&gt;
[http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Walker-Percys-Weirdest-Book/23835/ Walker Percy's Weirdest Book]&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2006 book ''Secrets of The Superoptimist'', authors W.R. Morton and Nathanel Whitten revealed the concept of "superoptimism" as a humorous antidote to the overblown self-help book category.  In his comedy special ''[[Complaints and Grievances]]'' (2001), [[George Carlin]] observes that there is "no such thing" as self-help: anyone looking for help from someone else does not technically get "self" help; and one who accomplishes something without help, did not need help to begin with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Margaret Atwood]]'s semi-satiric dystopia ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'', university literary studies have declined to the point that the protagonist, Snowman, is instructed to write his thesis on self-help books as literature; more revealing of the authors and of the society that produced them than genuinely helpful.

The term '''''shooting bias''''', also known as "'''shooter bias'''", is a form of [[implicit bias|implicit]] racial [[bias]] which refers to the tendency among the police to shoot black civilians rather than white civilians, even when they are unarmed.

The probability of being shot by the police depends on factors such as ethnicity, location, the income of the neighborhood and whether or not the person is carrying a weapon&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as well as the emotions shown by the victim.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kubota|first=Jennifer T.|last2=Ito|first2=Tiffany A.|title=The role of expression and race in weapons identification|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0038214|journal=Emotion|language=en|volume=14|issue=6|pages=1115–1124|doi=10.1037/a0038214|pmc=4235656|pmid=25401289|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Problems with police reporting practices ===
Police data could be biased due to police reporting practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klinger|first=David A.|date=2011-12-13|title=On the Problems and Promise of Research on Lethal Police Violence|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1088767911430861|journal=Homicide Studies|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=78–96|doi=10.1177/1088767911430861}}&lt;/ref&gt; Departments can voluntary include [[Justifiable homicide|justifiable homicides]] in the crime statistics of the [[Uniform Crime Reports|FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports]], which means that a lot of departments don't provide data at all. Some cities haven't reported their data in years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/nobodycounts-police-killings-in-the-u-s/article_8ec76c48-4414-5861-9183-134c75a4be10.html|title=Nobody counts police killings in the U.S.|last=Moskop|first=Christine Byers, Walker|work=stltoday.com|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the official data doesn't accurately reflect the number of civilians that are shot by the police.

Newspapers like ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' have started gathering a database of [[Lists of killings by law enforcement officers|fatal police shootings]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database|title=The Counted: people killed by police in the United States – interactive|last=Swaine|first=Jon|last2=Laughland|first2=Oliver|website=the Guardian|access-date=2017-07-30|last3=Lartey|first3=Jamiles|last4=Davis|first4=Kenan|last5=Harris|first5=Rich|last6=Popovich|first6=Nadja|last7=Powell|first7=Kenton|last8=team|first8=Guardian US interactive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2017/|title=Police shootings 2017 database|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealing that in 2015 twice as many civilians had been fatally shot than the FBI's data suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/police-are-fatally-shooting-people-at-twice-the-rate-reported/article_828cd4cf-5d87-581d-b3b8-e93aefddebd5.html|title=Police are fatally shooting people at twice the rate reported by FBI, analysis finds|last=Post|first=Washington|work=stltoday.com|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; An FBI working group has started working on a proposal for making the reports more accurate, but they would still rely on voluntary data and therefore wouldn't fix the main reporting issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/fbi-to-sharply-expand-system-for-tracking-police-shootings/article_67fa6d49-f54c-554d-a591-b33bad32fe05.html|title=FBI to sharply expand system for tracking police shootings|last=Post|first=Kimberly Kindy Washington|work=stltoday.com|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative database by ''The Guardian'' ===
The database developed by ''[[The Guardian]]'' is currently the largest database on fatal shootings available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hehman|first=Eric|last2=Flake|first2=Jessica K.|last3=Calanchini|first3=Jimmy|date=2017-07-27|title=Disproportionate Use of Lethal Force in Policing Is Associated With Regional Racial Biases of Residents|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1948550617711229|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|language=en|pages=1948550617711229|doi=10.1177/1948550617711229|issn=1948-5506}}&lt;/ref&gt; They gather data through police reports, monitoring of regional news, fact-checked witness statements and other crowdsourced police fatality databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/about-the-counted|title=About The Counted: why and how the Guardian is counting US police killings|website=the Guardian|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Number of deaths ===
In 2016, ''The Guardian'' counted 1093 people&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; who were killed by the police in the United States. Out of these 574 were white and 266 were black. 95 of the white victims were unarmed, 42 of the black victims were unarmed.

More white than black people are shot. It is important to distinguish to differentiate between the number of deaths of an ethnic group and the likelihood of being shot by police. The likelihood of being shot as a black rather than a white person is higher, whether the victim is armed or not.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Prominent examples of unarmed black civilians being fatally shot by the police include: 

* November 22, 2014: [[Tamir Rice]] (Cleveland) was killed by police officers at the age of 12 because they mistook his toy gun, which lacked the orange safety feature marking it as a replica and not a true firearm, for a real weapon.

== Likelihood of being shot: Black vs. White ==
A study carried out at the [[University of California]] found "evidence of a significant bias in the killing of unarmed black Americans compared to unarmed white Americans".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Cody T.|date=2015-11-05|title=A Multi-Level Bayesian Analysis of Racial Bias in Police Shootings at the County-Level in the United States, 2011–2014|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=10|issue=11|pages=e0141854|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0141854|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4634878|pmid=26540108}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, the probability of being shot by the police as a black, unarmed person versus as a white, unarmed person was 3.49 times higher. Unarmed Hispanics' likelihood to be shot was 1.67 times higher than for unarmed Whites.

The number vary greatly depending on the county, sometimes reaching a probability of 20 to 1 or more for unarmed blacks to be shot. There are several maps that showcase the [https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/ distribution of fatal shootings across the country].

Contrary to popular belief, crime rate was not associated with likelihood of being shot in this study.

== Factors that influence decision to shoot ==

=== List of empirically researched factors ===
Empirical research suggests the following factors to influence the decision to shoot:

* Status armed/unarmed&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Gender (men are more likely to be shot)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/deadly-force-in-black-and-white|title=Deadly Force, in Black and White|last=Sagara|first=Ryan Gabrielson, Ryann Grochowski Jones, Eric|date=2014-10-10|work=ProPublica|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Implicit racial bias ====
An implicit [[Bias|racial bias]] refers to unintentional judgments a person makes of a group (e.g. good/bad) of a certain ethnicity. So a person who shows implicit racial bias might not be aware of it. Police officers have been found to show a racial bias against black people in the decision to shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Correll|first=Joshua|last2=Park|first2=Bernadette|last3=Judd|first3=Charles M.|last4=Wittenbrink|first4=Bernd|last5=Sadler|first5=Melody S.|last6=Keesee|first6=Tracie|title=Across the thin blue line: Police officers and racial bias in the decision to shoot|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.6.1006|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=92|issue=6|pages=1006–1023|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.6.1006|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the studies, researchers investigated how stereotypes affected police officers' decisions to shoot. They used a video game and exposed their participants to pictures of either Whites or Non-Whites who were armed or unarmed. During this video game, the participants were asked to choose between "shoot" or "don't shoot" as quickly as possible. The results were that the participants shot armed black people faster than armed white people and chose "don't shoot" faster for unarmed white than unarmed black persons.

The authors explained those findings by the activation of stereotype thinking which lead white people to associate black people with danger. Because of this stereotype, the participants expected blacks to carry a gun and therefore were quicker to make the "shooting" decision.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Correll, J., Park, B., Judd, C.

==== Location and context ====
The American police officers live and work in a society full of prejudices against minorities. In addition, police officers usually deal with high crime rates in minority neighborhoods. These experiences reinforce their existing prejudices by ignoring that most people with a non-white ethnic background don’t become criminals. This leads to discrimination against minorities. Other factors that lead to discrimination by the police are institutionalized language barriers between police and some ethnic groups, experiences with disrespectful or hostile residents in certain minority neighborhoods and low punishment for police officers who misbehave towards minorities.

Those prejudices by the police are of course being noticed by the groups of minorities. So in return, the groups believe that the officers have prejudices against them. This might lead to the findings that Non-Whites are more likely to behave disrespectfully or to insult officers.

To sum up, there may exist a mutual influence between the prejudices that police officers have against minorities and the prejudices that minorities have against officers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Weitzer, Ronald. (1996). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222387219_Racial_discrimination_in_the_criminal_justice_system_Findings_and_problems_in_the_literature Racial discrimination in the criminal justice system: Findings and problems in the literature]. Journal of Criminal Justice. 24, (4), 309-322. doi:10.1016/0047-2352(96)00015-3&lt;/ref&gt;

=====  Examples that showcase prejudices among police officers&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; =====
*Disruptive actions by the police like stopping and questioning citizens on the street are more common in minority neighborhoods
*More cases of Non-Whites are being dropped than of Whites. This is because the reasons for arresting them were too weak and unjustified in the first place.
*American police officers shoot more easily Non-Whites than Whites

== Ways to reduce shooting bias ==
Possibly the biggest change could be made by holding police officers accountable for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/12/06/i-was-a-st-louis-cop-my-peers-were-racist-and-violent-and-theres-only-one-fix/|title=Being a cop showed me just how racist and violent the police are.

Knowing the factors that influence police officers decisions to shoot there are a few possible solutions for reducing shooting bias. The main factor is implicit racial bias, which in turn is exuberated by certain factors that could be addressed.

Diversity in police departments might not reduce shooting bias,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Brad W.|date=2003-05-01|title=The Impact of Police Officer Diversity on Police-Caused Homicides|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1541-0072.t01-1-00009/abstract|journal=Policy Studies Journal|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=147–162|doi=10.1111/1541-0072.t01-1-00009|issn=1541-0072}}&lt;/ref&gt; but reducing fatigue might lower the impact of racial bias on the decision to shoot.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Changing the training of police officers so as to not showcase black armed targets more often than white ones could help reduce racial bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sim|first=Jessica J.|last2=Correll|first2=Joshua|last3=Sadler|first3=Melody S.|date=2013-03-01|title=Understanding Police and Expert Performance: When Training Attenuates (vs. Exacerbates) Stereotypic Bias in the Decision to Shoot|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0146167212473157|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language=en|volume=39|issue=3|pages=291–304|doi=10.1177/0146167212473157|pmid=23401478|issn=0146-1672}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plant|first=E.

Training police officers in making decisions under stress as well as assigning officers to certain locations so they can become familiar with its residents could reduce the numbers of civilians killed, says Richmond's police chief, Chris Magnus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/9/18/6111457/example-good-police-relations-cops-killing-outreach-culture-training|title=How to not shoot civilians: 9 community policing tips from a chief who got it right|last=Lind|first=Dara|date=2014-09-18|website=Vox|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial bias can be contagious within a social group or neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weisbuch|first=Max|last2=Pauker|first2=Kristin|date=2011-12-01|title=The Nonverbal Transmission of Intergroup Bias: A Model of Bias Contagion with Implications for Social Policy|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-2409.2011.01032.x/abstract|journal=Social Issues and Policy Review|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|pages=257–291|doi=10.1111/j.1751-2409.2011.01032.x|issn=1751-2409|pmc=3756600|pmid=23997812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weisbuch|first=Max|last2=Pauker|first2=Kristin|last3=Ambady|first3=Nalini|date=2009-12-18|title=The Subtle Transmission of Race Bias via Televised Nonverbal Behavior|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5960/1711|journal=Science|language=en|volume=326|issue=5960|pages=1711–1714|doi=10.1126/science.1178358|issn=0036-8075|pmc=3764987|pmid=20019288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training police officers to be aware of this might help in reducing this effect.

'''Shooting incident reconstruction''' is the examination of the [[Real evidence|physical evidence]] recovered or documented at the scene of a [[shooting]]. Shooting reconstruction may also include the laboratory analysis of the evidence recovered at the scene. The goal is an attempt to gain an understanding of what may or may not have happened during the incident. Once all reasonable explanations have been considered, one can evaluate the significance of witness or suspect accounts of the incident.

In many cases valuable evidence necessary for reconstruction analysis exists at the crime scene. Should this evidence go undocumented or unrecovered during the initial processing of the shooting scene, the information it can give investigators may be lost forever. Poor shooting incident processing can not be compensated for by excellent laboratory work.

There are many questions that can be answered from the proper reconstruction of a shooting incident. Some of the questions typically answered by a shooting reconstruction investigation include (but not limited to) the distance of the shooter from the target, The path of the bullet(s), The number of shots fired and possibly the sequence of multiple discharges at a shooting incident.

The [[Association of Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners]] is an international [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to the advancement of [[firearm]] and [[tool mark]] identification, including shooting reconstruction.

{{discrimination sidebar}}

'''''Snob''''' is a pejorative term for a person that believes there is a correlation between [[social status]] and human worth.&lt;ref name=debotton&gt;De Botton, A. (2004), ''Status Anxiety''. London: Hamish Hamilton&lt;/ref&gt; ''Snob'' also refers to a person that feels superiority over those from lower social classes, education levels, or other social areas. The word ''snobbery'' came into use for the first time in England during the 1820s.

A snob is also a tool (an anvil) used by cobblers in the manufacture of footwear.

== Examples ==
Snobs can through time be found ingratiating themselves with a range of prominent groups – soldiers ([[Sparta]], 400 BC), bishops (Rome, 1500), poets (Weimar, 1815), farmers (China, 1967) – for the primary interests of snobs is distinction, and as its definition changes, so, naturally and immediately, will the objects of the snob's admiration.&lt;ref name="debotton" /&gt;

Snobbery existed also in mediaeval feudal aristocratic Europe, when the clothing, manners, language and tastes of every class were strictly codified by customs or law.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} [[Chaucer]], a poet moving in the court circles, noted the provincial French spoken by the Prioress among the [[Canterbury Tales|Canterbury pilgrims]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And French she spoke full fair and fetisly&lt;br&gt;
After the school of Stratford atte Bowe,&lt;br&gt;
For French of Paris was to her unknowe.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

William Rothwell notes "the simplistic contrast between the 'pure' French of Paris and her 'defective' French of Stratford atte Bowe that would invite disparagement".&lt;ref&gt;Rothwell, "Stratford Atte Bowe re-visited" ''The Chaucer Review'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Snobbery surfaced more strongly as the structure of the society changed, and the [[bourgeoisie]] had the possibility to ''imitate'' [[aristocracy]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Snobbery appears when elements of culture are perceived as belonging to an aristocracy or elite, and some people (the snobs) feel that the mere adoption of the fashion and tastes of the elite or aristocracy is sufficient to include someone in the elites, upper classes or aristocracy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

However, a form of snobbery can be adopted by someone not a part of that group; a [[pseudointellectual|pseudo-intellectual]], a celebrity worshipper, and a poor person idolizing money and the rich are types of snobs who do not base their snobbery on their personal attributes. {{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}Such a snob idolizes and imitates, if possible, the manners, worldview, and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] of a classification of people to which they aspire, but do not belong, and to which they may never belong (wealthy, famous, intellectual, beautiful, etc.).{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Snob victim==
The term "snob" is often misused when describing a "gold-tap owner",&lt;ref name="debotton" /&gt; i.e. a person who insists on displaying (sometimes non-existent) wealth through [[conspicuous consumption]] of luxury goods such as clothes, jewelry, cars etc. Displaying awards or talents in a rude manner, boasting, is a form of snobbery. A popular example of a "snob victim" is the television character [[Hyacinth Bucket]] of the BBC comedy series ''[[Keeping Up Appearances]]''.

== Analysis ==
[[William Hazlitt]] observed, in a culture where deference to class was accepted as a positive and unifying principle,&lt;ref&gt;The social historian [[G.M. Trevelyan]] referred to the deferential principle in British society as "beneficent snobbery", according to Ray 1955:24.&lt;/ref&gt; "Fashion is gentility running away from vulgarity, and afraid of being overtaken by it," adding subversively, "It is a sign the two things are not very far apart."&lt;ref&gt;Hazlitt, ''Conversations with Northcote'', quoted in Gordon N. Ray, "Thackeray's 'Book of Snobs'", ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'' '''10'''.1 (June 1955:22-33) p. 25; Ray examines the context of snobbery in contemporaneous society.&lt;/ref&gt; The English novelist [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Bulwer-Lytton]] remarked in passing, "Ideas travel upwards, ''manners'' downwards."&lt;!--italics in original--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bulwer-Lytton, ''England and the English'', noted in Ray 1955:24.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not the deeply ingrained and fundamentally accepted idea of "one's betters" that has marked snobbery in traditional European and American culture, but "aping one's betters".

Snobbery is a defensive expression of [[Emotional insecurity|social insecurity]], flourishing most where an [[The Establishment|Establishment]] has become less than secure in the exercise of its traditional prerogatives, and thus it was more an organizing principle for Thackeray's glimpses of British society in the threatening atmosphere of the 1840s than it was of Hazlitt, writing in the comparative social stability of the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ray 1955:25f.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Toddler throwing a tantrum.ogg|thumb|Toddler throwing a [[tantrum]]]]

A '''tantrum''', '''temper tantrum''', '''meltdown''' or '''hissy fit''' is an [[emotion]]al [[wikt:outburst|outburst]], usually associated with children or those in emotional distress, that is typically characterized by [[wikt:stubborn|stubbornness]], [[crying]], [[screaming]], [[violence]], [[wikt:defy|defiance]], [[anger|angry]] [[wikt:rant|ranting]], a resistance to attempts at pacification, and, in some cases, hitting, and other physically violent behavior. Physical control may be lost; the person may be unable to remain still; and even if the "goal" of the person is met, he or she may not be calmed.&lt;ref name="babycentre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babycentre.co.uk/toddler/penelopeleach/whatisatantrum/ |title=What is a tantrum? |publisher=Babycentre.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kidshealth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/parent/emotions/behavior/tantrums.html |title=Temper Tantrums |publisher=Kidshealth.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babycenter.com/0_tantrums_11569.bc |title=Tantrums |publisher=BabyCenter |date= |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalchild.org/jan_hunt/tantrum.html |title=When a Child Has a Tantrum – The Natural Child Project |publisher=Naturalchild.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A tantrum may be expressed in a tirade: a protracted, angry speech.&lt;ref name="babycentre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kidshealth" /&gt;

==In early childhood==
Tantrums are one of the most common forms of problematic behavior in young children, but tend to decrease in frequency and intensity as the child grows older. For the [[toddler]], tantrums can be considered as normal, even as gauges of a developing strength of character.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner/John Cleese, ''Families and how to survive them'' (London 1993) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Kasketaldi_haurra_001.jpg|thumb|Child having a tantrum]]While tantrums are sometimes seen as a predictor of future [[anti-social behaviour]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Potegal, Michael, L.P. |author2=Davidson, Richard J. | title = Temper Tantrums in Young Children| journal = Journal of Developmental &amp; Behavioral Pediatrics| volume = 24| issue = 3| pages = 140–147| date = June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; in another sense they are simply an age-appropriate sign of excessive [[frustration]], and will diminish over time given a calm and consistent handling.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Benaroch, ''Solving Health and Behavioral Problems from Birth Through Preschool'' (2008) p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;  Parental containment where a child cannot contain itself—rather than what the child is ostensibly demanding—may be what is really required.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 113-4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Selma Fraiberg]] warned against "too much pressure or forceful methods of control from the outside" in child-rearing: "if we turn every instance of pants changing, treasure hunting, napping, puddle wading and garbage distribution into a governmental crisis we can easily bring on fierce defiance, tantrums, and all the fireworks of revolt in the nursery".&lt;ref&gt;Selma H. Fraiberg, ''The Magic Years'' (New York 1987), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intellectual disabilites ==
Some people who have neurological disorders such as [[autism]], [[ADHD]], and [[intellectual disability]] could be more vulnerable to tantrums than others, although anyone experiencing brain damage (temporary or permanent) can suffer from tantrums. Anyone may be prone to tantrums once in a while, regardless of gender or age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autism.lovetoknow.com/Temper_Tantrums_and_Autism|title=Temper Tantrums and Autism - LoveToKnow|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a meltdown due to [[sensory overload]] (which even [[neurotypical]] children can experience) is not the same as a temper tantrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bennie|first1=Maureen|title=Tantrum vs Autistic Meltdown: What Is The Difference?|url=https://autismawarenesscentre.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-tantrum-and-an-autistic-meltdown/|website=Autism Awareness|publisher=Autism Awareness Centre Inc.|accessdate=9 June 2017|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aberrations==
[[Freud]] considered that the [[Sergei Pankejeff|Wolf Man]]'s development of temper tantrums was connected with his seduction by his sister: he became "discontented, irritable and violent, took offence on every possible occasion, and then flew into a rage and screamed like a savage".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; Freud linked the tantrums to an unconscious need for punishment driven by feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]&lt;ref&gt;Freud, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;—something which he thought could be generalised to many other cases of childhood tantrums.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) p. 257-8 and p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heinz Kohut]] contended that tantrums were [[narcissistic rages]],&lt;ref name="I. Goldenberg, 2007 p. 172"&gt;H. and I. Goldenberg, ''Family Therapy'' (2007) p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; caused by the thwarting of the infant's [[Grandiosity|grandiose]]-[[exhibitionist]] core.  The blow to the inflated self-image, when a child's wishes are (however justifiably) refused, creates fury because it strikes at the feeling of [[omnipotence]].&lt;ref name="Gambling 1974 p. 182"&gt;[[Edmund Bergler]] in J. Halliday/P. Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (London 1974) p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jealousy]] over the birth of a sibling, and resulting aggression, may also provoke [[negativistic]] tantrums, as the effort at controlling the feelings overloads the child's system of self-regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Selma H. Fraiberg, ''The Magic Years'' (New York 1987) p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

==In later life==
[[Thackeray]] claimed that in later life "you may tell a Tantrum as far as you can see one, by the distressed and dissatisfied expression of its countenance—'Tantrumical', if we may term it so".&lt;ref&gt;William Makepeace Thackeray, ''The Irish Sketch Book'' (1848) p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heinz Kohut]] contended that "the infant's core is likely to contain a self-centred, [[Grandiosity|grandiose]]-exhibitionist part", and that "tantrums at being frustrated thus represent [[narcissistic rages]]"&lt;ref name="I. Goldenberg, 2007 p. 172"/&gt; at the blow to the inflated self-image. With "a child confronted with some refusal ... regardless of its justifications, the refusal automatically provokes fury, since it offends his sense of [[omnipotence]]".&lt;ref name="Gambling 1974 p. 182"/&gt;

The willingness of the [[celebrity culture|celebrity]] to throw tantrums whenever thwarted to the least degree&lt;ref&gt;Cooper Lawrence, ''The Cult of Celebrity'' (2009) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; is a kind of [[Acquired Situational Narcissism]]&lt;ref&gt;Simon Crompton, ''All about Me'' (London 2007) p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; or tantrumical behavior.

If tantrums are shown by older people they might often be signs of immaturity and a mental disability; however, many people can have them under extreme stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/health-news/adult-temper-tantrums-1.1126134|title=North Jersey|website=North Jersey|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7715">'''''Uniclass 2015''''' is a unified classification system for all sectors of the UK construction industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenbs.com/services/our-tools/introducing-uniclass-2015|title=Introducing Uniclass 2015|publisher=theNBS.com|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains consistent tables classifying items of all scales, from facilities such as a railway to products like [[anchor plate]]s, flue liners or [[LED lamp]]s. 

Originally released in 1997, Uniclass allows project information to be structured to a recognised standard. This original version has now been heavily revised, to make it more suitable for use with modern construction industry practice, and to make it compatible with BIM ([[Building information modeling]]) now and in the future. 

Led by the [[National Building Specification]] (NBS), experts from across the industry have developed the new system, known as Uniclass 2015.  This significantly extends the scope of the previous version, and responds to industry feedback on the draft tables known as Uniclass 2, published by CPI in 2013.

Uniclass 2015 provides:

*A unified classification system for the construction industry. For the first time, buildings, landscape and infrastructure can be classified under one unified scheme
*A hierarchical suite of tables that support classification from a university campus or road network to a floor tile or kerb unit
*A numbering system that is flexible enough to accommodate future classification requirements
*A system compliant with [[ISO 12006]] that is mapped to NRM1 and supports mapping to other classification systems in the future
*A classification system that will be maintained and updated by NBS.

==Development==
Uniclass 2015 has been restructured and redeveloped to provide a comprehensive system suitable for use by the entire industry, including the infrastructure, landscape, and engineering services as well as the building sector, and for all stages in a project life cycle.

Uniclass 2015 provides a means of structuring project information essential for the adoption of BIM Level 2. Information about a project can be generated, used and retrieved throughout the life cycle.

The initial classification work has focussed on the seven core tables that describe an asset required to support the Digital Plan of Work; additional tables covering Form of Information, Project Management and Construction Aids are also under development.

Uniclass 2015 has been carefully structured to be in accordance with ISO 12006-2 ''Building construction – Organization of information about construction works – Part 2: Framework for classification''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=61753|title=ISO 12006-2:2015 Building construction -- Organization of information about construction works -- Part 2: Framework for classification|publisher=iso.org|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that Uniclass 2015 is particularly suited to use in an international context, as mapping to other similarly compliant schemes around the world is streamlined.

==Application==
Uniclass 2015 is divided into a set of tables, each accommodating a different ‘class’ of information.  These can be used to categorise information for costing, briefing, CAD layering, etc. as well as when preparing specifications or other production documents.

These tables are also suitable for buildings and other assets in use, and maintaining asset management and facilities management information.

==The tables==
The suite of tables&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://toolkit.thenbs.com/articles/classification#classificationtables|title=Full Uniclass 2015 classification tables|publisher=theNBS.com|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; are broadly hierarchical, and allow information about a project to be defined from the broadest view of it to the most detailed.  For detailed design and construction, the main starting point are '''Entities''', which are composed of '''Elements'''; Elements are made up of '''Systems''' which in turn contain '''Products'''. 

Entities can also be described using the '''Spaces''' and '''Activities''' tables if required, and at the more general level the '''Complexes''' table contains terms that can be thought of as groupings of Entities, Activities and Spaces.  

Looked at more closely, the tables comprise:

*'''Complexes''': a Complex describes a project in overall terms. It can be a private house with garden, drive, garage and tool shed, or it can be a University campus with buildings for lecturing, administration, sport, halls of residence, etc. Rail networks and airports are also examples of complexes
*'''Entities''': Entities are discrete things like buildings, bridges, tunnels etc. They provide the areas where different activities occur
*'''Activities''': this defines the activities to be carried out in the complex, entity or space. For example a prison complex provides a Detention activity at a high level, but can also be broken down into individual activities like exercise, sleeping, eating, working, etc.  The Activities table also includes surveys, operation and maintenance and services
*'''Spaces/Locations''': in buildings, spaces are provided for various activities to take place. In some cases a space is only suitable for one activity, for example a kitchen, but a school hall may be used for assemblies, lunches, sports, concerts and dramas. Also classed as spaces are transport corridors that run between two locations, such as the railway between London Kings Cross to Newcastle, or the M1 from London to Leeds
*'''Elements and functions''': elements are the main components of a structure like a bridge (foundations, piers, deck) or a building (floors, walls and roofs). Functions cover things like lighting, heating and water: general requirements that are not yet designed
*'''Systems''': Systems are the collection of components that go together to make an element or to carry out a function. For a pitched roof, the rafters, lining, tiles, ceiling boards, insulation and ceiling finish comprise a system, or a low temperature hot water heating system is formed from a boiler, pipework, tank, radiators etc.
*'''Products''': finally, the individual products used to construct a system can be specified, e.g. joist hangers, terrazzo tiles, gas fired boilers.

==Using the classification system==
The tables need to be flexible and to be able to accommodate sufficient codings to ensure coverage, to allow for a multitude of items and circumstances, including new technologies and developments that are yet to emerge.

Each code consists of either four or five pairs of characters. The initial pair identifies which table is being used and employs letters. The four following pairs represent groups, sub-groups, sections and objects. By selecting pairs of numbers, up to 99 items can be included in each group of codes, allowing plenty of scope for inclusion.

For example, Systems are arranged in groups with subgroups which are sub divided, which leads to the final object code.  For instance: 

*'''SS_30''' Roof, floor and paving systems
*'''SS_30_10''' Pitched, arched and domed roof structure systems
*'''SS_30_10_30''' Framed roof structure systems
*'''SS_30_10_30_25''' Heavy steel roof framing systems

or

*'''SS_50''' Disposal systems
*'''SS_50_75''' Wastewater storage, treatment and disposal systems
*'''SS_50_75_67''' Primary sewage treatment and final settlement systems
*'''SS_50_75_67_46''' Lamella tank systems

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1380">In [[law]] and [[philosophy]], '''voluntariness''' is a choice being made of a person's [[free will]], as opposed to being made as the result of [[coercion]] or [[duress]]. Philosophies such as [[libertarianism]] and [[voluntaryism]], as well as many legal systems, hold that a contract must be voluntarily agreed to by a party in order to be binding on that party. The [[social contract]] rests on the concept of the voluntary [[consent of the governed]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]] provide that "Before accepting a plea of guilty or [[nolo contendere]], the court must address the defendant personally in open court and determine that the plea is voluntary and did not result from force, threats, or promises (other than promises in a plea agreement)."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/Rule11.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The actual voluntariness is suspect, in that it is common for prosecutors to threaten to seek more prison time unless the defendant agrees to plead guilty. For this reason, [[common law]] courts historically took a negative view of guilty pleas.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/clr79&amp;section=11|title=Plea bargaining and its history|author=AW Alschuler|publisher=Colum L.

Founded in 1989, the '''ZKM | Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe''' is a cultural institution which, since 1997, has been located in a historical industrial building in [[Karlsruhe]], [[Germany]] that formerly housed a munitions factory. The ZKM organizes special exhibitions and thematic events, carries out research projects, produces works in the field of [[new media]] and offers public as well as individualized communications and educational programs.

The ZKM houses under one roof two [[museums]], three research institutes as well as a media center; in this way it groups research and production, exhibitions and events, archives and collections. It works on the interface of art and science, and takes up cutting-edge insights{{clarify|date=February 2018}} in media technologies with the objective of developing them further. Since the death of founding director Heinrich Klotz (1935-1999), the ZKM has been directed by Prof. [[Peter Weibel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/wis/fut/fuw/ins/en2671703.htm "We're More than just a Museum"] In: goethe.de/enindex.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the ZKM, the associated [[Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design]], as well as the Städtische Galerie Karlsruhe [Municipal Gallery Karlsruhe] are likewise housed in the former munitions factory.

== History ==
[[Image:Käfer ZKM CC.jpg|thumb|during exhibition ''Car Culture'' in 2011, ''Car Building'' by [[Hans Hollein]]]]
The founding of the Center for Art and Media goes back to the early 1980s. In the context of an ever-expanding media landscape, and in conjunction with a transformation of the art world, representatives from local government, the [[University of Karlsruhe]], the University of Music Karlsruhe, the [[Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe]] [Center for Nuclear Research Karlsruhe] and other institutes, as well as organizations and representatives of the Karlsruhe art scene formed the “Projektgruppe ZKM” [ZKM Project Group] in 1986. In February 1988 the Projektgruppe ZKM presented the content of their work as “Konzept 88” [Concept ‘88], in which the initiative for the fusion of the arts and the new media was outlined in both theory and practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/stories/storyReader$3854 ZKM Beginnings]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508205459/http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/stories/storyReader%243854 |date=May 8, 2012 }} In: zkm.de&lt;/ref&gt;

With the founding of a board of trustees in 1989, and the appointment of Heinrich Klotz as founding director, the realization of the ZKM became concrete. Three dates mark the ZKM’s foundation: the resolution by the local council dated May 9, 1989, the decision by the Council of Ministers of the State of Baden-Württemberg dated June 3, 1989, and the constitution of the board of trustees with effect from August 12, 1989. When initially founded, the ZKM was located in various buildings around the city. Prior to the move to its present location, the media art festival MultiMediale (MultiMediale 1-5, 1989-1997) took place at various sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/stories/storyReader$3854 ZKM Beginnings]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508205459/http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/stories/storyReader%243854 |date=May 8, 2012 }} In: zkm.de&lt;/ref&gt;

For some considerable time, an area to the south of the [[Karlsruhe Central Station]] had been designated. To this end, an international architect’s competition for the new building was announced on March 1989, from which the visionary design by Dutch architect [[Rem Koolhaas]] was to result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.archinform.net/projekte/2623.htm Rem Koolhaas] In: eng.archinform.net&lt;/ref&gt; However, the construction of the so-called Koolhaas-Cube was abandoned in 1992 for reasons of costs and space in favor of the conversion of the disused factory building.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Klotz (Ed.): Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie Karlsruhe. Architektur-Wettbewerb. Oktogon-Verlag, Stuttgart-München 1990 {{ISBN|3-927789-04-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Karlsruhe opted for the conversion of the so-called “Hallenbau A” [Hall A], an industrial ruin erected between 1914 and 1918 by architect Philipp Jakob Manz as a weapons and munitions factory. The building, divided into ten atria and with a length of 312 meters had been built on the former factory site of the Industriewerke Karlsruhe-Augsburg (IWKA), an industrial wasteland since the 1970s to the south-west that separated the city center from the surrounding urban areas. The conversion, based on plans drafted by the Hamburg office of Schweger,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schweger-architects.com/en/architecture/buildings/#culture Schweger Buildings] In: schweger-architects.com/en/&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the extension of the Media Cube which takes account of the Koolhaas design, started in 1993. With the move to Hallenbau A in 1997, the ZKM disposed over a media theater, over concert and events spaces, a media center, studios and institutes for research and production as well as a media museum. In a second stage of construction, the spaces for the Museum of Contemporary Art (move in 1999) and the [[Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design]] (move in 2001) were finalized. From 2004 to 2005 the Museum of Contemporary Art was integrated into the ZKM.&lt;ref&gt;ZKM | Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe (Eds.): ZKM | Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe, Peter Weibel, Christiane Riedel.

== The Basic Idea ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;“The task envisaged for the ZKM is the sounding out of the creative possibilities between the traditional arts and media technologies for the purpose of achieving innovative results. The objective is the enrichment of the arts, not their technical amputation. For this reason both traditional and media arts must compete with one another. At the ZKM either aspect – each for itself and with one another – are given a voice. The Bauhaus, founded in Weimar in 1919, may serve as a model.” (Heinrich Klotz)&lt;ref&gt;Karl Georg Behr: Licht der Aufklärung, Zukunft der Künste. In: Die Rheinpfalz. 08.01.2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The basic idea as formulated by founding director Heinrich Klotz in 1992, was implemented and developed further in the years that followed. Today, the ZKM is chiefly characterized by four guiding ideas.

* The ZKM is a location for all forms of contemporary art. It is a platform for cross-border experiments between the fine arts and the performative arts. Research, production and presentation comprise all medial forms and methods, from oil painting through to App, from classical composition through to sampling. Exhibitions, publications and symposia open up new perspectives to new questions, the objectives of which are the setting of innovative and trend-setting themes.
* At the ZKM, people from all over the world and of all ages are invited to discover art. It is an open house that encourages its visitors to active participation, exchange and discussion. Actors from all social spheres – from the arts, sciences, politics, and the economy – are brought together for the purposes of exchanging together the essential questions of present and future.
* As a center of research and development both in theory and practice, the ZKM gathers together artists and scientists from various disciplines. Through the implementation of unusual methods, novel and innovative works, new knowledge and innovative and pioneering ideas begin to emerge.
* Through the collection and conservation of works of art and historic pieces of equipment, as well as the construction of a comprehensive archive for twentieth and twenty-first century arts, the ZKM takes up its role as the conserver of cultural heritage. Here, the conservation of “digital art” is attributed particular importance.

== The ZKM ==
The ZKM | Karlsruhe is home to two museums, three research institutions, a media center, a laboratory as well as a number of events spaces:
'''Museums'''
* ZKM | Media Museum
* ZKM | Museum of Contemporary Art

'''Institutes for Research and Production''' 
* ZKM | Institute for Visual Media
* ZKM | Institute for Music and Acoustics
 
'''Events Spaces'''
* ZKM_Media Theater
* ZKM_Lecture Hall
* ZKM_Cube

The two museums are open to the public as is the library together with media lounge. Furthermore, the Info Point, the Museum Shop&lt;ref&gt;[http://shop.zkm.de ZKM Museum Shop] In: zkm.de&lt;/ref&gt; and the Café/Bistro "mint"&lt;ref&gt;[http://zkm.de/en/visitor-services/restaurant mint – bistro.café.bar.catering] In: zkm.de&lt;/ref&gt; are located in the Foyer and accessible to visitors.

== Exhibitions and events ==
In the exhibitions and events, the ZKM shows approaches and themes of contemporary art, but also presents practically forgotten artists and art movements, as well as works of art in various media and genre – from App through to oil paintings.

=== ZKM | Media Museum ===
The central concerns of the Media Museum turn on the history and critique of the new media, which have been transforming the forms of everyday life for the past 50 years. Computer, telephone and Internet intervene in social and individual lives in that technical components become increasingly important. A further focus of the Media Museum is the interaction between observer and work of art: only through the actions and reactions of every single visitor do works actually emerge – the visitor itself becomes an element in the installation and, in this way, is able to explore the treatment with new technologies. With works of media art and interactive installations artists and scientists question media-technological developments and visions. Temporary exhibitions, such as “net_condition. Art/Politics in the Online Universe”&lt;ref&gt;[http://on1.zkm.de/netcondition/ net_condition] in: zkm.de&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?tid=3824&amp;ttype=2 net_condition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616125512/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?tid=3824&amp;ttype=2 |date=June 16, 2012 }} In: mitpress.mit.edu&lt;/ref&gt; (September 1999 to February 2000), “Iconoclash.

=== ZKM | Museum of Contemporary Art ===
[[File:Colonelkarlsruhe.jpg|thumb|The 'Biennalist Headquarter' by [[Thierry Geoffroy]]/Colonel 2011 in the exhibition "The Global Contemporary. Art Worlds after 1989"&lt;ref&gt;[http://global-contemporary.de/en Global Contemporary. Art Worlds after 1989] In: zkm.de&lt;/ref&gt; (September 2011 to February 2012)]] Since December 1999, the Museum of Contemporary Art has been located in the atria 1 and 2 of the former munitions factory. Across 7.000 sqm exhibition space, the museum displays works from private collections, namely the FER COLLECTION, the Sammlung Grässlin [Grässlin Collection], the Sammlung Siegfried Weishaupt [Weishaupt Collection], the collection of the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, VAF-Stiftung / Museo di arte moderna e contemporanea di Trento e Rovereto [VAF Foundation / Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Trento and Rovereto] (MART), as well as the Boros Collection, together with exponents drawn from the ZKM Collection and further collaborating collections. Temporary exhibitions, above all from the second half of the twentieth centuries through to contemporary approaches in contemporary art are presented. Among others monographic exhibitions, on [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Bill Viola]], [[Sigmar Polke]], [[Franz West]], [[Sylvie Fleury]], [[Martin Kippenberger]] and Tobias Rehberger have been taking place since 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/stories/storyReader$2780 ZKM Exhibitions Archive]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719185456/http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/stories/storyReader%242780 |date=July 19, 2012 }} In: zkm.de&lt;/ref&gt; Special, thematic exhibitions were, inter alia “Making Things Public.

Furthermore, smaller scale exhibitions are held in the museum project spaces.

=== Events ===
Alongside exhibitions, '''events''' as platforms for the exchange with visitors and actors from various spheres of social life such as politics, the economy or philosophy take place. The form and content of events vary: from opera with multimedial stages to scientific symposia and popular concerts through to performances, dance or film-screenings. Here, the ZKM functions both as an organizer and cooperation partner, but also leases out its facilities. The events take place in various spaces, among others, the Lecture Hall, the Media Theater, the Foyer and the ZKM_Cube.

== Research and Production ==
The research institutes of the ZKM facilitate the development of trans-disciplinary projects. The research performance is, in part, carried out independently at the ZKM, but mostly as part of collaborations with further educational and research institutions. Their objective is to analyze and investigate the most recent image, music and communications technologies with respect to their applicability and relevance for art and an increasingly globally networked scientific (online) community.

=== ZKM | Institute for Visual Media ===

Founded in 1991 the Institute for Visual Media creatively and critically investigates the permanently transforming media culture. Unique artistic developments, the cooperation with internal guest artists (William Forsythe, Bill Viola et al.) as well as cooperation with culture and research institutes, comprise some of the elements of the institute's work. The work results which follow from this are presented in the context of exhibitions and conferences. The Institute's production spectrum ranges from digital video and 3D animation to interactive installations and environments, from software systems through to the real-time generation of natural and architectonic environments and audio-visual applications for performance contexts. Until 2011, one of the institute's focal points comprised the sphere of immersive projection environments (e.g. PanoramaScreen), in the context of which hardware and software solutions for artistic projects were developed. Since then, emphasis has been placed on, among others, the development of augmented reality productions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/e/institute/bildmedien/ Institute for Visual Media] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810013519/http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/e/institute/bildmedien/ |date=August 10, 2012 }} In: zkm.de&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ZKM | Institute for Music and Acoustics ===
The Institute for Music and Acoustics carries out research and development in the field of electro-acoustic and experimental music, as well as in the spheres of digital sound systems and algorithmic composition. It also supports guest artists and scientists in productions, organizes contemporary concerts and initiates symposia and festivals. Thus, the European meeting of the electronic studios,  called “next_generation”, takes place biannually and the concert festival Quantensprünge [Quantum Leaps] on a six-monthly basis. In addition to this, the institute awards the Giga-Hertz Prize&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giga-hertz.de/container2.html Giga-Hertz Award] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702195108/http://www.giga-hertz.de/container2.html |date=July 2, 2012 }} In: giga-hertz.de&lt;/ref&gt; that is the most generously endowed award for electronic music, as well as the Walter-Fink Prize &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fink-preis.de/index_e.html Walter-Fink-Prize] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719013318/http://www.fink-preis.de/index_e.html |date=2011-07-19 }} In: zkm.de&lt;/ref&gt; for Dance, Electronic Music and Media since 2009. Located in the interior of the “Blue Cube” there is a sound studio for artistic productions.

== Archives and collections ==
The '''ZKM Collection''' was founded by the ZKM's first director, Heinrich Klotz, at the beginning of the 1990s and has been augmented ever since. It is sub-divided into the collections: the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Media Museum collections, the Video and Audio collections as well as several archives. The collection is based on a specific approach to various artistic genre and media: whereas painting and sculpture were hermetically sealed off from new influences of video art and photography which were gradually establishing themselves, the ZKM's collecting activity is marked by the transcendence of such traditional genre borders.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Weibel, Christiane Riedel (Eds.): ZKM Guide 1989-2009. ZKM | Karlsruhe, 2009. p.72-75. {{ISBN|978-3-928201-40-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While the Museum of Contemporary Art collection embraced works of art from all genre from the outset, the Media Museum collection initially contained only works of interactive media most of which were produced in-house. Over 500 international guest artists &lt;ref&gt;[http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/artists/ Artists] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508040228/http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/artists/ |date=May 8, 2012 }} In: zkm.de&lt;/ref&gt; produced a vast number of works, which then became part of the ZKM Collection after being initially presented in Karlsruhe. Consequently, the ZKM disposes over one of the largest collections of media art extending back to the beginning of video art, electronic installation and holography. To these also belong the collection of approx. 1.200 art videos and 13.800 audio tracks, which are not stored in the museum but are accessible in the ZKM | Media Library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/e/institute/mediathek/ Media Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010527195257/http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/e/institute/mediathek |date=May 27, 2001 }} In: zkm.de&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be found on Dieter Mankau's four listening chairs and, for the most part, can be researched via the Internet.

The '''Video Collection''' was constructed as the first of its kind in Germany and increased the public awareness of video as an independent art form. The collection encompasses works of video art ranging from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, among others, the video magazine “Infermental”. Through the Laboratory for Antiquated Video Systems, which is connected to the Media Library it has been possible to rescue comprehensive video collections in Europe and the US from decomposition, and make them accessible to the public.

The '''Audio Collection''' comprises the titles of contemporary music with an emphasis on electro-acoustic music. In addition to audio recordings, the collection includes scores, specialist publications, historical photography and posters. Especial importance is attributed to the International Digital Electro-acoustic Music Archive (IDEAMA), which includes pieces of electro-acoustic music from its inception through to the present.

In addition to works of video art and electronic music, the ZKM collects '''archives''' and documents on the electronic arts, such as on video art, electro-acoustic music, computer art and inter-medial forms. It provides researchers with insight and an understanding for the artistic developments of the foregoing 50 years.

The common '''ZKM Library''' shared with the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design (HfG) comprises approx. 53.000 books, journals and digital storage media. Thematically, its inventory concentrates on twentieth and twenty-first century art and, above all, on media art, architecture, design, media theory, film, photography and electro-acoustic music. All the library's inventories may be researched on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hsportal.bsz-bw.de/servlet/Top/searchadvanced?language=en Library]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} In: zkm.de&lt;/ref&gt;
