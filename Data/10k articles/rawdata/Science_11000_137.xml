      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3221">An '''active surface''' is a surface of a [[radio telescope]] that is under active computer control of its shape.

Large (more than  10&amp;nbsp;m in diameter or length) radio telescopes always bend during operation, due to their enormous weight and the fact that even the strongest materials are not perfectly stiff.  This bending, in the range of a few millimetres, does not affect low frequency operation much, but dramatically reduces the efficiency of the telescope at higher frequencies where the wavelengths are comparable to the distortion.  Typically, the efficiency of a telescope drops appreciably when the deviation from the desired shape is more than 1/10 of the considered wavelength.  An active surface uses numerous small actuators to move the surface panels with respect to the underlying frame, and thus maintain the correct shape.

An active surface can try to compensate for many different types of errors.  The first is gravity&amp;mdash;this is simplest since previous measurements, or even a mathematical model, can be used to predict (and correct) any bending.  More difficult is correction for wind and thermal errors, since these require measuring and correcting in real time.

Some examples of active surfaces are:
*[[Green Bank Telescope]]
*[[Large Millimeter Telescope]]
*[[Sardinia Radio Telescope]]
*[[Noto Radio Observatory]]

The Chinese [[Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope]] uses a uniquely ambitious form of active surface, not only correcting errors, but applying deflections of up to {{convert|47|cm}} in order to aim and focus the telescope.

The '''Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere''' ('''AIM''') is a [[satellite]] to conduct a 26-month study of [[noctilucent cloud]]s (NLCs). It is the ninetieth [[Explorer program]] mission and is part of the [[NASA]]-funded [[Small Explorer program]] (SMEX). On April 25, 2007 AIM was boosted into a {{Convert|600|km|abbr=on}} high [[polar orbit]] by a [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus-XL]] rocket, which was [[air-launch]]ed from the [[Lockheed L-1011|Lockheed L-1011 ''Stargazer'']] aircraft operated by [[Orbital Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Jeanne Ryba | title=AIM Mission - Launch | url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/aim/launch/launch-index.html | publisher=NASA | date=4 June 2007 | accessdate=2010-03-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100316191155/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/aim/launch/launch-index.html| archivedate= 16 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The noctilucent clouds AIM is to study, also known as [[Polar mesospheric clouds]], occur in [[aeronomy|the Earth's atmosphere]] at high altitudes of roughly {{Convert|80|km|sp=us}} above the surface, far higher than other [[cloud]]s. The AIM mission will help determine what factors — [[temperature]], [[water vapor]], and [[dust]] particles — lead to the formation of these clouds. The clouds seem to be a relatively recent phenomenon: they were first seen in 1885, and lately seem to be occurring more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/aim | title=AIM — NASA Science | publisher=NASA | year=2010 | accessdate=2010-03-16 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324222208/http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/aim | archivedate=24 March 2010 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The clouds always occur during the summer season near the poles and the Northern season always starts around the same time.

'''Aquarium fish feeders''' are [[electric]] or [[Electronics|electronic]] devices that are designed to feed [[aquarium]] fish at regular intervals. They are often used to feed fish when the [[aquarist]] is on vacation or is too busy to maintain a regular feeding schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Feeding Your Fish While You're Gone on a Vacation | publisher =AquariumFish.net | url =http://www.aquariumfish.net/information/feeding_fish_2.htm | accessdate =2009-05-15 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090411074613/http://www.aquariumfish.net/information/feeding_fish_2.htm| archivedate= 11 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Fish feeders are usually clamped to the wall of the tank just over the water. They consist of a hopper which is loaded with a variety of dry food, a timer which rotates the hopper at regular intervals (dispensing food in the process), and a method of setting the interval between feeding and the amount of food dispensed. 

Most feeders can dispense [[Flake food|flake]], [[Pellet food|pellet]], or [[Freeze dried food|freeze dried]] food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Hauter | first =Stan |author2=Hauter, Debbie | title =Top 9 Automatic Fish Feeders | publisher =About.com | url =http://saltaquarium.about.com/cs/foodcare/tp/TPautofeeders.htm | accessdate =2009-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits of electronic aquarium feeders==
The benefits of electronic aquarium feeders are not only that the fish are fed when the [[aquarist]] is not at home, but they are also helpful in maintaining the fish' health. Because they are feeding small portions of food at scheduled intervals and precise feedings at appropriate times, the automatic feeders can be successfully used to feed diabetic fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autopetfeeder.com/shopexd.asp?id=129| title=Electronic Aquarium Feeder |accessdate=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another concern of aquarists is [[overeating]]. Fish are not to be given too much food. It is estimated that fish should be given as much as they can eat in 3 to 5 minutes, and once a day. However, the electronic fish feeders prevent overeating by releasing the right quantity of food, at scheduled times. This way, aquarists who have to get away for few days do not have to ask their neighbours or friends to come over and take care of their pets. It is often impossible to find a reliable person available and willing to do such a favor. The electronic fish feeders are therefore a solution for fish keepers who own aquariums and which ensure that the pets are fed in a healthy way and on schedule.

Another advantage of these devices is that electronic fish feeders may also be used to feed [[amphibians]], if they are kept in glass cages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electronicpetfeeder.net/fish.php| title=Automatic Fish Feeders Information |accessdate=2010-05-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100522122214/http://www.electronicpetfeeder.net/fish.php| archivedate= 22 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are also disadvantages that come with the electronic feeders. First, fish tend to get used to where and when the timer is going to trigger and food is going to fall which can create a feeding frenzy when the feeder drops the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wetwebmedia.com/ca/volume_2/cav2i4/impressions/feeder_impressions.htm| title=Automatic Feeder Impressions |accessdate=2010-05-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100529093727/http://www.wetwebmedia.com/ca/volume_2/cav2i4/impressions/feeder_impressions.htm| archivedate= 29 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usually results in a lot of splashing which may wet the rest of the food. [[Mold]] can then grow and the [[leftover]] food is likely to go bad or to clog the feeder's mechanism. The humidity and moisture due to close proximity to the water can also cause this type of problem with an electronic feeder. Second, one has to make sure that the food containers are properly sealed and the food is kept fresh. At this time electronic feeders are not able to adjust to the changing needs of the fish over longer periods which may result in either overfeeding or [[underfeeding]]. Too much food in the water is not only bad for the fish, but also for their environment.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Maintenance of electronic aquarium feeders==
The maintenance of electronic aquarium feeders basically consists in keeping the device clean and making sure the electronic part of the feeder does not get wet, which may cause improper functioning.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Limitations==
Though some feeders are designed specifically to keep food dry, many designs allow moisture to seep into the food hopper. This can cause clumping, and can result in the failure of the mechanism. Because fish feeders generally cannot feed [[Frozen food|frozen]] or [[Live food|live]] food, they are not effective options for feeding most [[predatory]] fish.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fishlab.com/automatic-fish-feeder/ Automatic fish feeder]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Automatic Fish Feeders | publisher =About.com | url =http://saltaquarium.about.com/od/autofeeders/Automatic_Fish_Feeders.htm | accessdate =2009-05-15 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090514012152/http://saltaquarium.about.com/od/autofeeders/Automatic_Fish_Feeders.htm| archivedate= 14 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bad Astronomy: Misconceptions and Misuses Revealed, from Astrology to the Moon Landing "Hoax"''''' is a non-fiction book by the American astronomer [[Phil Plait]], also known as "the Bad Astronomer". The book was published in 2002 and deals with various misunderstandings about space and astronomy, such as [[sound]]s being audible in space (a [[list of common misconceptions|misconception]] because in the [[vacuum]] of space, sound has no medium in which to propagate).

Plait's first book received generally favorable reviews within the academic and astronomy communities and was the first volume in the [[Wiley Bad Science Series|''Bad Science'']] series by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons Publishing]].

==Overview==
Inspired by the author's web site, "Bad Astronomy," the book attempts to explore twenty-four common astronomical fallacies and explain the scientific consensus concerning these topics within the field of [[astronomy]].&lt;ref name=Wiley&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The book explains and corrects many ideas relating to space that, according to Plait, are mistaken but nevertheless often portrayed in popular movies.  Plait also dedicates much of the book to debunking the idea of a [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|Moon landing hoax]] and explains why [[astrology]] should not be taken seriously. A part of the book describes the Moon's [[tidal effect]]s and explains the [[Coriolis effect]], why the sky is blue, the [[Big Bang]] and other related topics.

Many of the book's topics and arguments also are found on Plait's page at the ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine blog site, but Plait explores them in greater depth in the book.  He states that the book is intended to debunk popular myths and also to describe science in an easily comprehensible way.&lt;ref name="the book"&gt;{{cite web|last=Plait |first=Phil |authorlink=Phil Plait |title="Bad Astronomy": The Book |url=http://www.badastronomy.com/book/ |work=Bad Astronomy |accessdate=30 April 2013 |year=2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423020957/http://www.badastronomy.com/book/ |archivedate=23 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Tormod Guldvog writes in his review that "It is indeed a gem when it comes to teaching things about common astronomical phenomena. Plait discusses common ways bad astronomy is communicated, in the media, in the classroom, and perhaps, most of all, in our own minds."&lt;ref name=Tormod&gt;

===Bad Astronomy Begins at Home===
Part I of ''Bad Astronomy'', "Bad Astronomy Begins at Home," focuses on examples of astronomical misconceptions that are typically associated with the household or classroom, including the effect of the [[List of MythBusters special episodes#"Egg-uinox"|equinox on an egg's ability]] to balance upright without falling onto its side, the Coriolis effect's rumored effect on direction of whirlpools in household plumbing, and astronomical misunderstandings inherent in common English idioms, such as "meteoric rise" and "[[Far side of the Moon|dark side of the Moon]]."&lt;ref name="plait-2002"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===From the Earth to the Moon===
Part II of the book, "From the Earth to the Moon," focuses on Earth's orbit and atmosphere and the Moon, with particular emphasis on how photon scattering results in the sky appearing blue, the impact of axial tilt on seasons, the impact of the Moon's presence, and misconceptions regarding the "[[Moon illusion|Moon Size Illusion]],"&lt;ref name="plait-2002" /&gt; explaining why and how the Moon appears larger when closer to the horizon.&lt;ref name="unisci" /&gt;

===Skies at Night are Big and Bright===
Part III, "Skies at Night are Big and Bright," concentrates on the viewing of objects further away than the radius of the Moon's orbit around Earth, including the optical "twinkle" effect when viewing some stars, the brightness and color of stars, observation of meteors and asteroids, and using astronomical observations to study the beginning of the universe.&lt;ref name="plait-2002" /&gt; Plait's chapter on meteors and asteroids delves into terms and distinctions and explains, for example, "why small meteors are cold, not hot, when they hit the ground."&lt;ref name="unisci" /&gt;

===Artificial Intelligence===
Part IV, "Artificial Intelligence," attempts to tackle various conspiracy theories and alternate worldviews, including the so-called [[Moon Landing Hoax]], [[Young-Earth Creationism]], [[Immanuel Velikovsky]]'s book ''[[Worlds in Collision]]'' (which asserts that a relatively young [[Venus]] was once a part of Jupiter), extraterrestrial claims regarding [[unidentified flying objects]] (UFOs), and [[astrology]].&lt;ref name="plait-2002" /&gt; In "Appalled at Apollo," the section devoted to Moon landing hoax conspiracy theories, Plait examines aspects of the hoax theory and compares its claims against basic laws of physics.&lt;ref name="Savannah" /&gt; [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] listed Chapter 17, "Appalled at Apollo," on a list of resources stating it was "good ammunition for debunking the notion that NASA never went to the Moon point by point."&lt;ref name="ASP"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In the chapter "Misidentified Flying Objects," Plait discusses various ways that cameras  sometimes distort images, which Plait writes are often responsible for examples of evidence presented by extraterrestrial UFO proponents.&lt;ref name="Savannah" /&gt; A chapter devoted to astrology explores the topic, explaining "why astrology doesn't work."&lt;ref name="unisci" /&gt;

===Beam Me Up===
Part V, "Beam Me Up," explores additional topics, such as common misconceptions regarding the Hubble Space Telescope and its funding, star-naming companies, and astronomy myths and inaccuracies perpetuated by Hollywood,&lt;ref name="plait-2002" /&gt; providing "The Top-Ten Examples of Bad Astronomy in Major Motion Pictures."&lt;ref name="unisci" /&gt;

A '''bay''' is a recessed, [[coastal]] body of water that directly connects to a larger main body of water, such as an [[ocean]], a [[lake]], or another bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of BAY|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bay|website=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=March 21, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chesapeake/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="bay"|work=Dictionary.com Unabridged|publisher=Random House, Inc.|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/bay |accessdate=March 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A large bay is usually called a [[Gulf (geography)|gulf]], [[sea]], [[sound (geography)|sound]], or [[bight (geography)|bight]]. A [[cove]] is a type of smaller bay with a circular [[inlet]] and narrow entrance. A [[fjord]] is a particularly steep bay shaped by glacial activity.

A bay can be the [[estuary]] of a river, such as the [[Chesapeake Bay]], an estuary of the [[Susquehanna River]].&lt;ref name=Chesapeake&gt;{{cite web|title=Chesapeake Bay, Maryland|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/01glance/html/ches.html|website=Maryland Manual On-Line|publisher=Maryland State Archives|accessdate=March 21, 2017|date=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bays may also be nested within each other; for example, [[James Bay]] is an arm of [[Hudson Bay]] in [[Atlantic Canada|northeastern Canada]]. Some large bays, such as the [[Bay of Bengal]] and Hudson Bay, have varied [[marine geology]].

The land surrounding a bay often reduces the strength of [[wind]]s and blocks [[wave]]s. Bays were significant in the history of [[human settlement]] because they provided safe places for [[fishing]]. Later they were important in the development of sea [[trade]] as the safe [[anchor]]age they provide encouraged their selection as [[port]]s.&lt;ref name="fenh"/&gt;

==Definition==
The [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS), also called the Law of the Sea,  defines a bay as a well-marked indentation whose penetration is in such proportion to the width of its mouth as to contain land-locked waters and constitute more than a mere curvature of the coast. An indentation shall not, however, be regarded as a bay unless its area is as large as, or larger than, that of the semi-circle whose diameter is a line drawn across the mouth of that indentation.

==Formation==
There are various ways in which bays can form. The largest bays have developed through [[plate tectonics]].&lt;ref name="fenh"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Family Encyclopedia of Natural History |editor1-first=Rosalind |editor1-last=Carreck |year=1982 |publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-11-202257-2 |pages=202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the super-continent [[Pangaea]] broke up along curved and indented fault lines, the continents moved apart and left large bays; these include the [[Gulf of Guinea]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and the [[Bay of Bengal]], which is the world's largest bay.&lt;ref name="fenh"/&gt;

Bays also form through coastal [[erosion]] by rivers and [[glacier]]s.&lt;ref name="fenh"/&gt; A bay formed by a glacier is a [[fjord]]. [[Ria]]s are created by rivers and are characterised by more gradual slopes. Deposits of softer rocks erode more rapidly, forming bays, while harder rocks erode less quickly, leaving [[headland]]s.

'''''Break Through: From the Death of Environmentalism to the Politics of Possibility''''', first published in October 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger (2007), ''Break Through: From the Death of Environmentalism to the Politics of Possibility'', Houghton Miflin, [http://thebreakthrough.org/blog/2008/04/25/Book_Intro_07.pdf Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; is a book written by [[Ted Nordhaus]] and [[Michael Shellenberger]], both long-time environmental strategists. ''Break Through'' is an argument for a positive, "post-environmental" politics that abandons the traditional [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] focus on [[nature protection]] for a focus on creating a new [[sustainability|sustainable]] economy. 

The book is based on a controversial October 2004 essay by the same authors, "The Death of Environmentalism: Global Warming Politics in a Post-Environmental World."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus, ''[http://www.thebreakthrough.org/PDF/Death_of_Environmentalism.pdf The Death of Environmentalism: Global Warming Politics in a Post-Environmental World]'', October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The essay argues that environmentalism is conceptually and institutionally incapable of dealing with [[climate change]] and should "die" so that a new politics can be born. The essay was widely discussed among liberals and greens at ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Salon'', 14 January 2005, [http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/feature/2005/01/14/death_of_environmentalism/ Dead movement walking?]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Grist.org|Grist]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Grist'', 13 January 2005, [http://www.grist.org/news/maindish/2005/01/13/doe-intro/ Don't Fear the Reapers: A special series on the alleged "Death of Environmentalism"]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Felicity Barringer, ''New York Times'', 6 February 2005, [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/06/national/06enviro.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin Paper Sets Off a Debate on Environmentalism's Future]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the failure of climate legislation in the [[U.S. Senate]] for the third time in June 2008, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' named Nordhaus and Shellenberger "Heroes of the Environment,"&lt;ref&gt;''Time'', 24 September 2008, [http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1841778_1841779_1841804,00.html Heroes of the Environment 2008 / Leaders and Visionaries]&lt;/ref&gt; calling ''Break Through'' "prescient" for its prediction that climate policy should focus not on making fossil fuels expensive through regulation but rather on making clean energy cheap. The book's authors reiterated this argument in a September 2008 op-ed for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', arguing for $30–$50bn in annual research subsidies for clean energy.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger, ''Los Angeles Times'', 30 September 2008, [http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-shellenberger30-2008sep30,0,5840948.story The green bubble bursts]&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2008 ''Break Through'' won the [[Center for Science Writing]]'s Green Book Award, which comes with a $5000 prize for the author(s).&lt;ref&gt;10 January 2008, Center for Science Writing, [[Stevens Institute of Technology]], [http://www.stevens.edu/csw/cgi-bin/blogs/csw/?p=101 Environmental critique wins Green Book Award] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602030150/http://www.stevens.edu/csw/cgi-bin/blogs/csw/?p=101 |date=June 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Break Through''==
The first half of ''Break Through'' is a criticism of the green "politics of limits." The book begins with the birth of environmentalism. Nordhaus and Shellenberger argue that environmentalism in the U.S. emerged from post-war affluence, which they argue is a clue to understanding how ecological movements might emerge in places like China and India. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Progressive social reforms, from the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] to the [[Clean Water Act]], tend to occur during times of prosperity and rising expectations—not immiseration and declining expectations. Both the [[environmental movement]] and the [[civil rights movement]] emerged as a consequence of rising prosperity. It was the middle-class, young, and educated black Americans who were on the forefront of the civil rights movement. Poor blacks were active, but the movement was overwhelmingly led by educated, middle-class intellectuals and community leaders (preachers prominent among them). This was also the case with the white supporters of the civil rights movement, who tended to be more highly educated and more affluent than the general American population. In short, the civil rights movement no more emerged because African Americans were suddenly denied their freedom than the environmental movement emerged because America suddenly started polluting.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chapter two criticizes conservation efforts in Brazil, suggesting that nature protection cannot save the Amazon unless environmentalists provide an alternative way for Brazil to prosper. The authors criticize the [[environmental justice movement]] as focusing on low-priority pollution concerns in communities of color, narrowing the movement's focus instead of expanding it to include job creation and [[public health]]. And they fault climate activists for seeing climate change as a pollution problem like [[acid rain]] and the [[ozone hole]] instead of as an [[economic development]] and technological innovation challenge. The authors draw on science philosopher [[Thomas Kuhn]] to argue that environmentalists are stuck in a "pollution [[paradigm]]" when it comes to [[global warming]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One of Kuhn’s most famous examples was of the revolution led first by [[Copernicus]] and later by [[Galileo]] to overthrow the Earth-centered view of the solar system and replace it with our current sun-centered one. But in other instances, new paradigms leave part of the old paradigms intact, such as Einstein’s [[theory of relativity]], which left Newton’s [[theory of gravity]] on Earth intact even as it revolutionized our understanding of mass and energy in the rest of the universe.
	&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such may be the case with environmentalism. In many situations the pollution paradigm may still be a good way of understanding and dealing with air and water pollution. Our contention is not that the pollution paradigm is no longer useful for dealing with acid rain or rivers aflame but that it is profoundly inadequate for understanding and dealing with global warming and other ecological crises.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Part II of Break Through, "the politics of possibility," is an argument for environmentalism to die and become reborn as a new progressive politics, one capable of winning a new [[social contract]] for Americans, so that they are financially secure enough to be able to care about ecological challenges, and a $500 billion public-private investment in clean energy. The last half of the book makes the case for a new social contract for the post-industrial age, one capable of helping Americans overcome "insecure affluence," whereby voters are both more materially wealthy but also more financially insecure than ever before. Nordhaus and Shellenberger say environmentalism should evolve from being a religion into being a church, and they see evangelical churches, with their capacity for providing belonging and fulfilment to their middle-class members, as models for a new "pre-political" institution for secular progressives. The authors argue for concrete policies, from "Global Warming Preparedness," and a global clean energy investment strategy modelled on the creation of the [[European Union]] after World War II. 

In the final chapter of'' Break Through,'' "Greatness," argues that global warming will reshape national and international politics:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Climate change and the political response to it is already defining a new fault line in the culture. On one side of that line will be a global [[NIMBY]]ism that sees the planet as too fragile to support the hopes and dreams of seven billion humans. It will seek to establish and enforce the equivalent of an international [[caste system]] in which the poor of the developing world are consigned to energy poverty in perpetuity. This politics of limits will be anti-immigration, anti-globalization, and anti-growth. It will be zero-sum, fiscally conservative, and deficit-oriented. It will combine [[Thomas Malthus|Malthus]]ian environmentalism with [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbesian]] conservatism.
	&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other side will be those who believe that there is room enough for all of us to live secure and free lives. It will be pro-growth, progressive, and internationalist. It will drive global development by creating new markets. It will see in institutions like the [[WTO]], the [[World Bank]], and the [[International Monetary Fund]] not a corporate conspiracy to keep people poor and destroy the environment, but an opportunity to drive a kind of development that is both sustainable and equitable. It will embrace technology without being [[technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocratic]]. It will seek adaptation proactively, not fatalistically. It will establish social and economic security as preconditions for ecological action. It will be large and transformative, but not [[millenarianism|millenarian]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Critical reception==
''Break Through'' was criticized and praised by both left and right. ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine wrote that ''Break Through'' "could turn out to be the best thing to happen to environmentalism since Rachel Carson's ''[[Silent Spring]]''."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Horowitz, ''Wired'', 25 September 2007, [https://www.wired.com/science/planetearth/magazine/15-10/mf_burning?currentPage=all Two Environmentalists Anger Their Brethren] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110172149/http://www.wired.com/science/planetearth/magazine/15-10/mf_burning?currentPage=all |date=January 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote, "If heeded, Nordhaus and Shellenberger's call for an optimistic outlook -- embracing economic dynamism and creative potential -- will surely do more for the environment than any U.N. report or Nobel Prize.".&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Adler, ''The Wall Street Journal'', 27 November 2007, [http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110010913 The Lowdown on Doomsday: Why the public shrugs at global warming]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[NPR]]'s science correspondent Richard Harris listed ''Break Through'' on his "recommended reading list" for climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode

Other reviewers were harshly critical.  [[Joseph Romm]], a former [[US Department of Energy]] official now with the [[Center for American Progress]], argued that "Pollution limits are far, far more important than R&amp;D for what really matters -- reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and driving clean technologies into the marketplace." &lt;ref&gt;Joe Romm, ''Grist'', 3 October 2007, [http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2007/10/2/151156/638 Debunking Shellenberger &amp; Nordhaus: Part I: The death of 'The Death of Environmentalism'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207200119/http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2007/10/2/151156/638 |date=December 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;(Romm also acknowledged that he had not read the book: "I won't waste time reading their new instant bestseller, unhelpfully titled ''Break Through,'' and you shouldn't either.") Reviewers for the ''San Francisco Chronicle'',&lt;ref&gt;Robert Collier, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 7 October 2007, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/07/RV2QSBFFQ.DTL&amp;type=politics Review: Why get so heated about global warming?]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''American Prospect''&lt;ref&gt;Kate Sheppard, ''American Prospect'', 11 October 2007, [http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=life_after_the_death_of_environmentalism Life After the Death of Environmentalism]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Harvard Law Review''&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Kysar, ''Harvard Law Review'', June 2008, [http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/121/june08/kysar.shtml The Consultants' Republic] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131011929/http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/121/june08/kysar.shtml |date=January 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that a critical reevaluation of green politics was unwarranted because global warming had become a high profile issue and the Democratic Congress was preparing to act.

==BBCH-scale (cereals)==
In agronomy, the ''BBCH-scale for cereals''' describes the [[phenology|phenological]] development of [[cereal]]s using the [[BBCH-scale]].

[[File:Wheat developmental stages.tif|thumb|Critical stages according to BBCH (Lancashire et al., 1991) and their deviations from the Zadok’s scale (in brackets). The spacing between the stages follows calendar time for the temperate climate of Switzerland (sowing in November, harvest mid-July)]]

The phenological growth stages and BBCH-identification keys of cereals are:

==Feekes scale==
The '''Feekes scale''' is a system to identify the growth and development of [[cereal|cereal crops]] introduced by the Dutch [[agronomy|agronomists]] Willem Feekes (1907-1979) in 1941.&lt;ref name="Feekes 1941"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feekes|first1=Willem|title=De tarwe en haar milieu [Wheat and its environment]|journal=Verslagen van de Technische Tarwe Commissie.|date=1941|volume=17|pages=523-888|language=Dutch (English summary)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Large1954 /&gt; This scale is more widely used in the [[United States]]&lt;ref name=Purdue /&gt; than other similar and more descriptive&lt;ref name=TAMU /&gt;&lt;ref name=WheatKentucky /&gt; scales such as the [[Zadoks scale]] or the [[BBCH-scale (cereals)|BBCH scale]]. Like other scales of crop development, the Feekes scale is useful in planning management strategies that incorporate plant growth information for the use of [[pesticides]] and [[fertilizers]] to avoid damaging the crop and/or maximize [[crop yield]].

==Zadoks scale==
The '''Zadoks scale''' is a [[cereal]] development scale proposed by the Dutch [[Phytopathology|phytopathologist]] Jan C. Zadoks that is widely used in cereal research and agriculture.
Knowing the stages of development of a crop is critical in many management decisions that growers make.  They are represented on a scale from 10 to 92.  For example, in some countries, [[nitrogen]] and [[herbicide]] applications must be completed during the [[tiller (botany)|tiller]]ing stage. In [[France]], the recommendation for the first nitrogen application on wheat is 6 weeks before Z30, with the second application on Z30. [[Wheat]] growth regulators are typically applied at Z30. Disease control is most critical in the stem extension and heading stage (Z31, Z32, Z35), in particular as soon as the flag leaf is out (Z37). The crop is also more sensitive to heat or frost at some stages than others (for example, during the meiosis stage the crop is very sensitive to low temperature). Knowing the growth stage of the crop when checking for problems is essential for deciding which control measures should be followed.

Examples of typical stages
* during tillering
**Z10: one leaf
**Z21: tillering begins
* during stem extension
** Z30: ear is one centimeter long in wheat
** Z31: first node visible
** Z32: second node visible
** Z37: flag leaf
* during heading
**Z55: the head is 1/2 emerged.
* during ripening
**Z92: grains are ripe

A certification by the ABHP is not a license to practice and does not confer any legal qualification to practice [[health physics]]. However, the certification is well respected and indicates a high level of achievement by those who obtain it. 

Certified Health Physicists are plenary or emeritus members of the [[American Academy of Health Physics]] (AAHP). In 2015, the AAHP web site listed over 1500 plenary and emeritus members.

==Professional Responsibilities==
A person certified as a health physicist has a responsibility to uphold the professional integrity associated with the certification to promote the practice and science of [[radiation safety]]. It is expected that such a person will always give [[health physics]] information based on the highest standards of science and [[professional ethics]]. A certified individual has a responsibility to remain professionally active in the health physics field and remain technically competent in the scientific, technical and regulatory developments in the field.

==General requirements required to receive the certification==
The requirements for prospective candidates for certification are &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABHP Prospectus|url=http://www.hps1.org/aahp/boardweb/prospectus.html|publisher=American Board of Health Physics|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Academics. At least a [[bachelor's degree]] from an accredited college or university in physical sciences, engineering, or in a biological science, with a minimum of 20 semester hours in physical science.
#Experience. At least six years of professional experience in health physics. By permission of the Board, advanced degrees may substitute for one year ([[master's degree]]) or two years ([[doctorate]]) of the required experience.
#References. A reference from the immediate supervisor and from at least two other individuals, including one from a currently certified Health Physicist.
#Written Report. A written report that reflects a professional health physics effort.
#Examination. A two-part exam, which is given only one day a year at the [[Health Physics Society]]'s annual meeting, and on the same day, at other locations throughout the country. 
#*Part I consists of 150 multiple choice questions in fundamental aspects of health physics. This portion of the test is three hours long, and can be taken without most of the above requirements. 
#*Part II consists of open-ended written questions, which determine competency in [[applied health physics]]. This portion of the exam is six&amp;nbsp;hours long, and can only be taken after having passed Part I, or simultaneously with it. 
#*After passing Part I, the applicant must pass Part II within a period of seven years, or retake both parts. 
#*If a candidate scores particularly poorly on Part II, he or she will be barred from taking it the following year. 
#*Both parts include all of the topics below, but Part II requires candidates to answer only six mandatory questions and four of eight topic area questions. 

===Examination Topics===
*[[Atomic structure]]/[[Radioactivity]]/[[Radioactive decay]]
*Interaction of radiation with matter
*[[Internal dosimetry]]/Internal dose calculations
*Biological effects of [[ionizing radiation]]
*NRC, OSHA, Regulations/Standards ICRU, ICRP, NCRP
*Radiation Risk, BEIR III, IV, V, VI

A '''cratonic sequence''' is a very large-scale [[lithostratigraphy|lithostratographic]] sequence that covers a complete [[transgression (geology)|marine transgressive-regressive]] cycle across a [[craton]].  They are also known as "megasequences", "stratigraphic sequences", "sloss sequence", "supersequence" or simply "sequences".  In plain English, it is the geological evidence of the sea level rising and then falling, thereby depositing layers of sediment onto an area of ancient rock called a craton. Places such as the Grand Canyon are a good visual example of this, apparent in the layers deposited over time. 

Cratonic sequences were first proposed by [[Lawrence Sloss]] in 1963;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Publications/Bulletins/169/Sloss/ Lawrence Sloss, "Tectonic Cycles of the North American Craton". (Accessed 6/18/06)]&lt;/ref&gt; each one represents a time when [[epeiric sea]]s deposited [[sediment]]s across the craton, while the upper and lower edges of the sequence are bounded by craton-wide [[unconformity|unconformities]] eroded when the seas receded.

==Cause and chronology==
These sequences may in part represent [[eustasy|eustatic]] or global change in sea level; however, when the proper names are used they usually refer to the [[North America]]n [[continent]].  The most likely causes of these cycles is change in [[mid-ocean ridge]] volume, which is related to spreading rates.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Steven M. ''Earth System History''. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 1999. {{ISBN|0-7167-2882-6}}  p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;  When Earth's mid-ocean ridges spread rapidly, the ridges tend to be longer than usual; also, the greater heat elevates the [[lithosphere]] over the ridges.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;  This elevated lithosphere reduces ocean-basin volume and displaces water onto the continents; conversely, when spreading rates decline, the ridges subside, and the seas drain from the cratons.&lt;ref&gt;Stanely, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also possible that other mechanisms, such as [[dynamic topography]] related to mantle mass anomalies, and intraplate stress related to episodes of [[Thrust tectonics|contractional]] and [[extensional tectonics]], play a part by causing significant tectonic uplift and subsidence across the craton.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess et al. 1997, Bull Geol. Soc. America&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been six cratonic sequences since the beginning of the [[Cambrian|Cambrian Period]].  For North America, from oldest to youngest, they are the [[Sauk sequence|Sauk]], [[Tippecanoe sequence|Tippecanoe]], [[Kaskaskia sequence|Kaskaskia]], [[Absaroka sequence|Absaroka]], [[Zuñi sequence|Zuñi]], and the [[Tejas sequence|Tejas]]. Attempts to identify equivalent cratonic sequences on other continents have met with only limited success, suggesting that eustasy is unlikely to be the sole responsible mechanism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4348">'''Descriptive botanical names''' are [[botanical nomenclature|scientific names]] of groups of plants that are irregular, not being derived systematically from the name of a [[type genus]].  They may describe some characteristics of the group in general or may be a name already in existence before regularised scientific nomenclature.

Descriptive names can occur above or at the rank of [[rank (botany)|family]]. There is only a single descriptive below the rank of family (the subfamily [[Papilionoideae]]).

==Above the rank of family==
Descriptive names above the rank of family are governed by Article 16&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art16|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|year=2012}} Article 16&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN), which rules that a name above the rank of family may be either be ‘automatically typified’ (such as Magnoliophyta and Magnoliopsida from the type genus ''Magnolia'') or be descriptive.

Descriptive names of this type may be used unchanged at different ranks (without modifying the suffix). These descriptive plant names are decreasing in importance, becoming less common than ‘automatically typified names’, but many are still in use, such as:
: Plantae, [[Algae]], [[Musci]], [[Fungi]], [[Embryophyta]], [[Tracheophyta]], [[Spermatophyta]], [[Gymnospermae]], [[Coniferae]], [[Coniferales]], [[Angiospermae]], [[Monocotyledones]], [[Dicotyledones]], etc.

Many of these descriptive names have a very long history, often preceding [[Carl Linnaeus]]. Some are [[Classical Latin]] common nouns in the [[nominative case|nominative]] plural, meaning for instance ‘the plants’, ‘the seaweeds’, ‘the mosses’. Like all names above the rank of family, these names follow the Latin grammatical rules of nouns in the plural, and are written with an initial capital letter.

==At the rank of family==
Article 18.5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art18|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|year=2012}} Article 18&lt;/ref&gt; of the ICN allows a descriptive name, of long usage, for the following eight families.  For each of these families there also exists a name based on the name of an included genus (an alternative name that is also allowed, here in parentheses):

* Compositae = "[[composite flower|composite]]s"  (alternative name: Asteraceae, based on the genus [[Aster (genus)|''Aster'']])
* Cruciferae = "cross-bearers"  (alternative name: Brassicaceae, based on the genus ''[[Brassica]]'')
* Gramineae = "grasses"  (alternative name: Poaceae, based on the genus ''[[Poa]]'')
* Guttiferae = "latex-carriers"  (alternative name: Clusiaceae, based on the genus ''[[Clusia]]'')
* Labiatae = "lipped ones"  (alternative name: Lamiaceae, based on the genus ''[[Lamium]]'')
* Leguminosae = "legumes"  (alternative name: Fabaceae, based on the genus ''Faba'', now considered a section of genus ''[[Vicia]]'')
* Palmae = "palms"  (alternative name: Arecaceae, based on the genus ''[[Areca]]'')
* Umbelliferae = "parasol-bearers" (alternative name: Apiaceae, based on the genus ''[[Apium]]'')

==Subfamily==
Special provision has been made in Article 19.8 for the plant subfamily name [[Papilionoideae]] to be an alternative name of the subfamily Faboideae,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art19|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|year=2012}} Article 19&lt;/ref&gt; because the family Papilionaceae had previously been [[conserved name|conserved]] when many botanists considered it to be a separate family from Fabaceae (Leguminosae).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lanjouw, J. |author2=Sprague, T.A. |year=1935|title=Additions and Amendments to the International Rules of Botanical Nomenclature, Ed. 3: (35) Appendix Ii. Nomina Familiarum conservanda|journal=Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information (Royal Gardens, Kew)|volume=1935|issue=2|pages=79–82|jstor=4107153|doi=10.2307/4107153}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name is not based on any plant genus named ''[[Papilio]]'' (a butterfly), but is a descriptive name meaning that the plant has butterfly-like flowers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="75457">'''Dual inheritance theory''' ('''DIT'''), also known as '''gene–culture coevolution''' or '''biocultural evolution''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Neil|first=Dennis|title=Glossary of Terms|url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/synthetic/glossary.htm#sectB|work=Modern Theories of Evolution|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed in the 1960s through early 1980s to explain how [[human behavior]] is a product of two different and interacting [[evolution]]ary processes: [[genetic evolution]] and [[cultural evolution]]. Genes and culture continually interact in a feedback loop,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laland|first=Kevin N.|date=2008-11-12|year=|title=Exploring gene–culture interactions: insights from handedness, sexual selection and niche-construction case studies|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/363/1509/3577|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=363|issue=1509|pages=3577–3589|doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0132|issn=0962-8436|pmc=2607340|pmid=18799415|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; changes in genes can lead to changes in culture which can then influence genetic selection, and vice versa. One of the theory's central claims is that culture evolves partly through a Darwinian selection process, which dual inheritance theorists often describe by analogy to genetic evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richerson|first= Peter J.|last2=Boyd|first2= Robert|title=Not By Genes Alone: How Culture Transformed Human Evolution|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2005|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/N/bo3615170.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Culture', in this context is defined as 'socially learned behavior', and 'social learning' is defined as copying behaviors observed in others or acquiring behaviors through being taught by others. Most of the modelling done in the field relies on the first dynamic (copying) though it can be extended to teaching. [[Social learning theory|Social learning]] at its simplest involves blind copying of behaviors from a model (someone observed behaving), though it is also understood to have many potential [[Biases in judgement and decision making|biases]], including success bias (copying from those who are perceived to be better off), status bias (copying from those with higher status), homophily (copying from those most like ourselves), conformist bias (disproportionately picking up behaviors that more people are performing), etc..  Understanding social learning is a system of pattern replication, and understanding that there are different rates of survival for different socially learned cultural variants, this sets up, by definition, an evolutionary structure: cultural evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=D. T.|title=Variation and selective retention in socio-cultural evolution|journal=Social Change in Developing Areas, a Reinterpretation of Evolutionary Theory|date=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because genetic evolution is relatively well understood, most of DIT examines cultural evolution and the interactions between cultural evolution and genetic evolution.

==Theoretical basis==

DIT holds that genetic and cultural evolution interacted in the evolution of ''Homo sapiens''.  DIT recognizes that the natural selection of genotypes is an important component of the evolution of human behavior and that cultural traits can be constrained by genetic imperatives. However, DIT also recognizes that genetic evolution has endowed the human species with a parallel evolutionary process of cultural evolution. DIT makes three main claims:&lt;ref name="McElreath"&gt;{{cite book |author1=McElreath, R. |author2=Henrich, J. |year=2007 |url=http://arbeit.ucdavis.edu/mcelreath/files/Henrich%20and%20McElreath%20final.pdf |chapter=Dual inheritance theory: the evolution of human cultural capacities and cultural evolution |editor=R. Dunbar and L. Barrett |title=Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811175148/http://arbeit.ucdavis.edu/mcelreath/files/Henrich%20and%20McElreath%20final.pdf |archivedate=2007-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture capacities are adaptations===

The human capacity to store and transmit culture arose from genetically evolved psychological mechanisms.  This implies that at some point during the evolution of the human species a type of [[Observational learning|social learning]] leading to cumulative cultural evolution was evolutionarily advantageous.

===Culture evolves===

Social learning processes give rise to cultural evolution.  Cultural traits are transmitted differently from genetic traits and, therefore, result in different population-level effects on behavioral variation.

===Genes and culture co-evolve===

Cultural traits alter the social and physical environments under which genetic selection operates.  For example, the cultural adoptions of agriculture and dairying have, in humans, caused genetic selection for the traits to digest starch and [[lactose]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simoons | first1 = F | year = 1969 | title = Primary adult lactose intolerance and the milking habit: A problem in biologic and cultural interrelations: I.

Werner, F. Villanea, J. Mountain, R. Misra, N. Carter, C. Lee, A. Stone. Diet and the evolution of human amylase gene copy number variation.  ''Nature Genetics'' 39:1256-1260.&lt;/ref&gt;  As another example, it is likely that once culture became adaptive, genetic selection caused a refinement of the cognitive architecture that stores and transmits cultural information.  This refinement may have further influenced the way culture is stored and the biases that govern its transmission.

DIT also predicts that, under certain situations, cultural evolution may select for traits that are genetically maladaptive.  An example of this is the [[demographic transition]], which describes the fall of birth rates within industrialized societies.  Dual inheritance theorists hypothesize that the demographic transition may be a result of a prestige bias, where individuals that forgo reproduction to gain more influence in industrial societies are more likely to be chosen as cultural models.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, R. and P. J. Richerson.  1985. '' Culture and the Evolutionary Process''.  Chicago: University of Chicago Press. pp. 199-202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richerson, P. J. and R. Boyd.  2005. ''Not By Genes Alone: How Culture Transformed Human Evolution''.  Chicago: University of Chicago Press. pp. 169-182.&lt;/ref&gt;

==View of culture==

People have defined the word "culture" to describe a large set of different phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Kroeberm A. and C. Kluckhohn.  1952. ''Culture; A Critical Review of Concepts and Definitions.''  Cambridge, MA: Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox, R. and B. King.  2002. ''Anthropology Beyond Culture'' Oxford: Berg.&lt;/ref&gt;  A definition that sums up what is meant by "culture" in DIT is:

{{Quotation|Culture is socially learned information stored in individuals' brains that is capable of affecting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Richerson, P. and R. Boyd.  2005. ''Not By Genes Alone: How Culture Transformed Human Evolution'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. pg 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, R. and P. Richerson. 2000. Memes: Universal Acid or a Better Mouse Trap? In R. Aunger, Ed. ''Darwinizing Culture: The Status of Memetics as a Science.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 143-162. [http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/boyd/CambMeme.PDF Full text]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This view of culture emphasizes population thinking by focusing on the process by which culture is generated and maintained.  It also views culture as a dynamic property of individuals, as opposed to a view of culture as a superorganic entity to which individuals must conform.&lt;ref&gt;Richerson, P.J. and R. Boyd. 2001. Culture is Part of Human Biology: Why the Superorganic Concept Serves the Human Sciences Badly. In ''Science Studies: Probing the Dynamics of Scientific Knowledge'', In S. Maasen and M. Winterhager, Ed. Bielefeld: Verlag.[http://xcelab.net/rm/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/cultureisbiology.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This view's main advantage is that it connects individual-level processes to population-level outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Richerson, P. and R. Boyd.  2005. ''Not By Genes Alone: How Culture Transformed Human Evolution'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. pg 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic influence on cultural evolution==

Genes affect cultural evolution via psychological predispositions on cultural learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/1047840X.2013.764814 | volume=24 | title=Promise and Challenges Surrounding Culture–Gene Coevolution and Gene–Culture Interactions | year=2013 | journal=Psychological Inquiry | pages=64–70 | last1 = Sasaki | first1 = Joni Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Genes encode much of the information needed to form the human brain.  Genes constrain the brain's structure and, hence, the ability of the brain to acquire and store culture.  Genes may also endow individuals with certain types of transmission bias (described below).

==Cultural influences on genetic evolution==

Culture can profoundly influence gene frequencies in a population.

'''Lactase persistence'''

One of the best known examples is the prevalence of the genotype for adult lactose absorption in human populations, such as Northern Europeans and some African societies, with a long history of raising cattle for milk.

'''Food processing'''

Culture has driven changes to the human digestive systems making many digestive organs, like our teeth or stomach, smaller than expected for primates of a similar size,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aiello|first=Leslie C.|last2=Wheeler|first2=Peter|date=1995-01-01|title=The Expensive-Tissue Hypothesis: The Brain and the Digestive System in Human and Primate Evolution|jstor=2744104|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=36|issue=2|pages=199–221|doi=10.1086/204350}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been attributed to one of the reasons why humans have such large brains compared to other great apes.&lt;ref name="Fonseca-Azevedo 18571–18576"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fonseca-Azevedo|first=Karina|last2=Herculano-Houzel|first2=Suzana|date=2012-11-06|title=Metabolic constraint imposes tradeoff between body size and number of brain neurons in human evolution|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/45/18571|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=109|issue=45|pages=18571–18576|doi=10.1073/pnas.1206390109|issn=0027-8424| pmc=3494886 |pmid=23090991|bibcode=2012PNAS..10918571F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gorman|first=Rachael Moeller|title=Cooking Up Bigger Brains|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cooking-up-bigger-brains/|journal=Scientific American|language=en|volume=298|issue=1|pages=102–105|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0108-102|year=2008|bibcode=2008SciAm.298a.102G}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to food processing. Early examples of food processing include pounding, marinating and most notably cooking.

Humans living on cooked diets spend only a fraction of their day chewing compared to other extant primates living on raw diets.

Despite its benefits, brain tissue requires a large amount of calories, hence a main constraint in selection for larger brains is calorie intake. A greater calorie intake can support greater quantities of brain tissue. This is argued to explain why human brains can be much larger than other apes, since humans are the only ape to engage in food processing.&lt;ref name="Fonseca-Azevedo 18571–18576"/&gt; The cooking of food has influenced genes to the extent that, research suggests, humans cannot live without cooking.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koebnick|first=C.|last2=Strassner|first2=C.|last3=Hoffmann|first3=I.|last4=Leitzmann|first4=C.|date=1999-01-01|title=Consequences of a long-term raw food diet on body weight and menstruation: results of a questionnaire survey|journal=Annals of Nutrition &amp; Metabolism|volume=43|issue=2|pages=69–79|doi=10.1159/000012770|issn=0250-6807|pmid=10436305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonseca-Azevedo 18571–18576" /&gt; A study on 513 individuals consuming long term raw diets found that as the percentage of their diet which was made up of raw food and/or the length they had been on a diet of raw food increased, their BMI decreased.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This is despite access to many non thermal processing, like grinding, pounding or heating to 48 deg. c.

==Mechanisms of cultural evolution==

In DIT, the evolution and maintenance of cultures is described by five major mechanisms: natural selection of cultural variants, random variation, cultural drift, guided variation and transmission bias.

===Natural selection===
Cultural differences among individuals can lead to differential survival of individuals. The patterns of this selective process depend on transmission biases and can result in behavior that is more adaptive to a given environment.

===Random variation===
Random variation arises from errors in the learning, display or recall of cultural information, and is roughly analogous to the process of [[mutation]] in genetic evolution.

===Cultural drift===
[[Cultural drift]] is a process roughly analogous to [[genetic drift]] in evolutionary biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koerper | first1 = H. | last2 = Stickel | first2 = E. | year = 1980 | title = Cultural Drift: A Primary Process of Culture Change | url = | journal = Journal of Anthropological Research | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 463–469 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CavalliSfornza"&gt;Cavalli-Sfornza, L. and M.

This effect should be especially strong in small populations.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, R. and P. J. Richerson.  1985. '' Culture and the Evolutionary Process''.  Chicago: University of Chicago Press. pp.9, 69&lt;/ref&gt; A model by Hahn and Bentley shows that cultural drift gives a reasonably good approximation to changes in the popularity of American baby names.&lt;ref name="duke" /&gt; Drift processes have also been suggested to explain changes in archaeological pottery and technology patent applications.&lt;ref name="artsci.wustl" /&gt;  Changes in the songs of song birds are also thought to arise from drift processes, where distinct dialects in different groups occur due to errors in songbird singing and acquisition by successive generations.&lt;ref&gt;P.J.B.

In "Encyclopedia of Animal Behavior", 2010, Pages 551-557.  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/referenceworks/9780080453378&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural drift is also observed in an early computer model of cultural evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Gabora, L.

''1993 Lectures in Complex Systems'', Addison-Wesley, 471-486.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guided variation===

Cultural traits may be gained in a population through the process of individual learning.  Once an individual learns a novel trait, it can be transmitted to other members of the population.  The process of guided variation depends on an adaptive standard that determines what cultural variants are learned.

===Biased transmission===

Understanding the different ways that culture traits can be transmitted between individuals has been an important part of DIT research since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feldman | first1 = M. | authorlink2 = Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza | last2 = Cavalli-Sforza | first2 = L. | year = 1976 | title = Cultural and biological evolutionary processes, selection for a trait under complex transmission | url = | journal = Theoretical Population Biology | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 238–259 | doi=10.1016/0040-5809(76)90047-2 | pmid=1273802}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feldman | first1 = M | last2 = Cavalli-Sfornza | first2 = L. | year = 1977 | title = The evolution of continuous variation: II, complex transmission and assortive mating | url = | journal = Theoretical Population Biology | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 161–181 | doi=10.1016/0040-5809(77)90024-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Transmission biases occur when some cultural variants are favored over others during the process of cultural transmission.&lt;ref name="Boyd"&gt;Boyd, R., and P. Richerson. 1985. ''Culture and the Evolutionary Process''. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Boyd and Richerson (1985)&lt;ref name="Boyd" /&gt; defined and analytically modeled a number of possible transmission biases.  The list of biases has been refined over the years, especially by Henrich and McElreath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henrich|first= J.|last2=McElreath|first2= R.|year=2003|title=The Evolution of Cultural Evolution|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology|volume=12|pages=123–135|url=http://www.anthro.ucdavis.edu/mcelreath/henrich%20mcelreath%20EA%202003.pdf#search='dual%20inheritance%20theorypdf'|doi=10.1002/evan.10110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Content bias====

Content biases result from situations where some aspect of a cultural variant's content makes them more likely to be adopted.&lt;ref name="Henrich"&gt;Henrich, J. and R. McElreath. 2007. Dual inheritance theory: the evolution of human cultural capacities and cultural evolution. Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, R. Dunbar and L. Barrett, eds., Ch. 38. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Content biases can result from genetic preferences, preferences determined by existing cultural traits, or a combination of the two.  For example, food preferences can result from genetic preferences for sugary or fatty foods and socially-learned eating practices and taboos.&lt;ref name="Henrich" /&gt;  Content biases are sometimes called "direct biases."&lt;ref name="Boyd" /&gt;

====Context bias====

Context biases result from individuals using clues about the social structure of their population to determine what cultural variants to adopt.  This determination is made without reference to the content of the variant.  There are two major categories of context biases: model-based biases, and frequency-dependent biases.

=====Model-based biases=====

Model-based biases result when an individual is biased to choose a particular "cultural model" to imitate.  There are four major categories of model-based biases: prestige bias, skill bias, success bias, and similarity bias.&lt;ref name="McElreath" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henrich | first1 = J. | last2 = McElreath | first2 = R. | year = 2003 | title = The evolution of cultural evolution | url = http://arbeit.ucdavis.edu/mcelreath/files/henrich%20mcelreath%20EA%202003.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 123–135 | doi=10.1002/evan.10110}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "prestige bias" results when individuals are more likely to imitate cultural models that are seen as having more [[:wikt:prestige|prestige]].  A measure of prestige could be the amount of deference shown to a potential cultural model by other individuals.  A "skill bias" results when individuals can directly observe different cultural models performing a learned skill and are more likely to imitate cultural models that perform better at the specific skill.  A "success bias" results from individuals preferentially imitating cultural models that they determine are most generally successful (as opposed to successful at a specific skill as in the skill bias.)  A "similarity bias" results when individuals are more likely to imitate cultural models that are perceived as being similar to the individual based on specific traits.

=====Frequency-dependent biases=====

Frequency-dependent biases result when an individual is biased to choose particular cultural variants based on their perceived frequency in the population.  The most explored frequency-dependent bias is the "conformity bias."  Conformity biases result when individuals attempt to copy the mean or the mode cultural variant in the population. Another possible frequency dependent bias is the "rarity bias."  The rarity bias results when individuals preferentially choose cultural variants that are less common in the population.  The rarity bias is also sometimes called a "nonconformist" or "anti-conformist" bias.

==Social learning and cumulative cultural evolution==

In DIT, the evolution of culture is dependent on the evolution of social learning.  Analytic models show that social learning becomes evolutionarily beneficial when the environment changes with enough frequency that genetic inheritance can not track the changes, but not fast enough that individual learning is more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Richerson, P.J. and R. Boyd. 2000. Climate, culture, and the evolution of cognition. In C.M. Heyes and L. Huber, (Eds), ''The Evolution of Cognition.'' Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For environments that have very little variability, social learning is not needed since genes can adapt fast enough to the changes that occur, and innate behaviour is able to deal with the constant environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0022519303931468/1-s2.0-S0022519303931468-main.pdf?_tid=47f68dc4-0897-11e7-a862-00000aab0f27&amp;acdnat=1489483329_f6919e6f16dd89881b45383b6ffa17f7|title=Carving the Cognitive Niche: Optimal Learning Strategies in Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Environments - ScienceDirect|website=ac.els-cdn.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fast changing environments cultural learning would not be useful because what the previous generation knew is now outdated and will provide no benefit in the changed environment, and hence individual learning is more beneficial. It is only in the moderately changing environment where cultural learning becomes useful since each generation shares a mostly similar environment but genes have insufficient time to change to changes in the environment.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; While other species have social learning, and thus some level of culture, only humans, some birds and chimpanzees are known to have cumulative culture.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasello, M. 1999.  ''The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Boyd and Richerson argue that the evolution of cumulative culture depends on observational learning and is uncommon in other species because it is ineffective when it is rare in a population.  They propose that the environmental changes occurring in the [[Pleistocene]] may have provided the right environmental conditions.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richerson | first1 = P.

''The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Tomasello proposed in the 80s that there are some disparities between the observational learning mechanisms found in humans and great apes - which go some way to explain the observable difference between great ape traditions and human types of culture (see [[Emulation (observational learning)]]).

==Cultural group selection==

Group selection occurs in cultural evolution because conformist biases make it difficult for novel cultural traits to spread through a population (see above section on transmission biases). Conformist bias also helps maintain variation between groups.  These two properties, rare in genetic transmission, are necessary for group selection to operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Uyenoyama | first1 = M. | last2 = Feldman | first2 = M.

Holden, and S. Shennan (Eds.) 2005.  ''The evolution of cultural diversity: a phylogenetic approach. '' London:University College London Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==

The idea that human cultures undergo a similar evolutionary process as genetic evolution goes back at least to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C.  1874. ''The descent of man and selection in relation to sex.'' 2nd ed. 2 vols. New York: American Home Library.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1960s, [[Donald T. Campbell]] published some of the first theoretical work that adapted principles of evolutionary theory to the evolution of cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, D. 1965.  Variation and selective retention in socio-cultural evolution.  In ''Social change in developing areas: A reinterpretation of evolutionary theory'', ed. H. Barringer, G. Blanksten, and R. Mack, 19-49.  Cambridge, MA: Schenkman Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, two developments in cultural evolutionary theory set the stage for DIT. In that year [[Richard Dawkins|Richard Dawkins's]] ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' introduced ideas of cultural evolution to a popular audience.  Although one of the best-selling science books of all time, because of its lack of mathematical rigor, it had little effect on the development of DIT. Also in 1976, geneticists [[Marcus Feldman]] and [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza]] published the first dynamic models of gene–culture coevolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feldman | first1 = M. | last2 = Cavalli-Sforna | first2 = L. | year = 1976 | title = Cultural and biological evolutionary processes, selection for a trait under complex transmission | url = | journal = Theoretical Population Biology | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 238–59 | doi=10.1016/0040-5809(76)90047-2 | pmid=1273802}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These models were to form the basis for subsequent work on DIT, heralded by the publication of three seminal books in the 1980s.

The first was Charles Lumsden and [[E. O. Wilson|E.O. Wilson's]] ''Genes, Mind and Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;Lumsden C., and E. Wilson.  1981.  ''Genes, Mind and Culture: The Coevolutionary Process.''  Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  This book outlined a series of mathematical models of how genetic evolution might favor the selection of cultural traits and how cultural traits might, in turn, affect the speed of genetic evolution.  While it was the first book published describing how genes and culture might coevolve, it had relatively little effect on the further development of DIT.&lt;ref name="Laland"&gt;Laland K. and G. Brown. 2002. ''Sense and Nonsense: Evolutionary Perspectives on Human Behavior''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics felt that their models depended too heavily on genetic mechanisms at the expense of cultural mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boyd | first1 = R. | last2 = Richerson | first2 = P. | year = 1983 | title = The cultural transmission of acquired variation: effects on genetic fitness | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 100 | issue = | pages = 567–96 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(83)90324-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Controversy surrounding Wilson's [[Sociobiology#Controversy|sociobiological theories]] may also have decreased the lasting effect of this book.&lt;ref name="Laland" /&gt;

The second 1981 book was [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Cavalli-Sforza]] and Feldman's ''Cultural Transmission and Evolution: A Quantitative Approach''.&lt;ref name="CavalliSfornza" /&gt;  Borrowing heavily from [[population genetics]] and [[epidemiology]], this book built a mathematical theory concerning the spread of cultural traits. It describes the evolutionary implications of [[vertical transmission]], passing cultural traits from parents to offspring; oblique transmission, passing cultural traits from any member of an older generation to a younger generation; and [[horizontal transmission]], passing traits between members of the same population.

The next significant DIT publication was [[Robert Boyd (anthropologist)|Robert Boyd]] and [[Peter Richerson]]'s 1985 ''Culture and the Evolutionary Process''.&lt;ref name="Boyd" /&gt; This book presents the now-standard mathematical models of the evolution of social learning under different environmental conditions, the population effects of social learning, various forces of selection on cultural learning rules, different forms of biased transmission and their population-level effects, and conflicts between cultural and genetic evolution.  The book's conclusion also outlined areas for future research that are still relevant today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marwick|first1=Ben|title=What Can Archaeology Do With Boyd and Richerson's Cultural Evolutionary Program?|journal=Review of Archaeology|date=2005|volume=26|issue=2|pages=30–40|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1885/44496|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current and future research==

In their 1985 book, Boyd and Richerson outlined an agenda for future DIT research. This agenda, outlined below, called for the development of both theoretical models and empirical research. DIT has since built a rich tradition of theoretical models over the past two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, R. and P. J. Richerson. 2005. ''The Origin and Evolution of Cultures''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 294-299.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there has not been a comparable level of empirical work.

In a 2006 interview Harvard biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] expressed disappointment at the little attention afforded to DIT:

{{Quotation|"...for some reason I haven't fully fathomed, this most promising frontier of scientific research has attracted very few people and very little effort."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haag | first1 = Allison | year = 2006 | title = The synthesizer | url = http://seedmagazine.com/news/2007/01/the_synthesizer.php | journal = SEED | volume = 2 | issue = 7| page = 46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Kevin Laland]] and Gillian Brown attribute this lack of attention to DIT's heavy reliance on formal modeling.

{{Quotation|"In many ways the most complex and potentially rewarding of all approaches, [DIT], with its multiple processes and cerebral onslaught of sigmas and deltas, may appear too abstract to all but the most enthusiastic reader. Until such a time as the theoretical hieroglyphics can be translated into a respectable empirical science most observers will remain immune to its message."&lt;ref&gt;Laland, K. N. and G. R. Brown. 2002. ''Sense &amp; Nonsense: Evolutionary Perspectives on Human Behavior.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Economist [[Herbert Gintis]] disagrees with this critique, citing empirical work as well as more recent work using techniques from [[behavioral economics]].&lt;ref&gt;Herb Gintis Amazon.com review: https://www.amazon.com/review/product/0198508840/&lt;/ref&gt; These behavioral economic techniques have been adapted to test predictions of cultural evolutionary models in laboratory settings&lt;ref&gt;McElreath, R., M.

Boyd, S. Bowles, C. Camerer, E. Fehr, H. Gintis (Eds). 2004. ''Foundations of Human Sociality: Economic Experiments and Ethnographic Evidence from Fifteen Small-Scale Societies'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since one of the goals of DIT is to explain the distribution of human cultural traits, [[ethnography|ethnographic]] and [[ethnology|ethnologic]] techniques may also be useful for testing hypothesis stemming from DIT. Although findings from traditional ethnologic studies have been used to buttress DIT arguments,&lt;ref&gt;Cavalli-Sfornza, L. L. and M. Feldman. 1981. ''Cultural Transmission and Evolution: A Quantitative Approach.'' Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, R. and P. J. Richerson. 1985. '' Culture and the Evolutionary Process''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; thus far there have been little ethnographic fieldwork designed to explicitly test these hypotheses.&lt;ref name="Soltis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henrich_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McElreath | first1 = R | year = 2004 | title = Social learning and the maintenance of cultural variation: An evolutionary model and data from East Africa | url = http://arbeit.ucdavis.edu/mcelreath/files/mcelreath%20AA%202004.pdf | format = PDF | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 106 | issue = | pages = 308–321 | doi=10.1525/aa.2004.106.2.308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herb Gintis has named DIT one of the two major conceptual theories with potential for unifying the behavioral sciences, including economics, biology, anthropology, sociology, psychology and political science. Because it addresses both the genetic and cultural components of human inheritance, Gintis sees DIT models as providing the best explanations for the ultimate cause of human behavior and the best paradigm for integrating those disciplines with evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gintis | first1 = H | year = 2006 | title = A framework for the integration of the behavioral sciences | url = http://www.umass.edu/preferen/gintis/Unity-BBS%20Print%20Version.pdf| journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 1–61 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x07000581}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of competing evolutionary perspectives on human behavior, Laland and Brown see DIT as the best candidate for uniting the other evolutionary perspectives under one theoretical umbrella.&lt;ref name="Laland_a"&gt;Laland, K. N. and G. R. Brown.  2002.  ''Sense &amp; Nonsense: Evolutionary Perspectives on Human Behavior.''  Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 287-319.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to other fields==

===Sociology and cultural anthropology===

Two major topics of study in both [[sociology]] and [[cultural anthropology]] are human cultures and cultural variation.
However, Dual Inheritance theorists charge that both disciplines too often treat culture as a static superorganic entity that dictates human behavior.&lt;ref name="Richerson"&gt;Richerson, P. and R. Boyd. 2001. [http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Richerson/CultureIsBiology.pdf Culture is part of human biology: Why the superorganic concept serves the human sciences badly]. In M. Goodman and A. S. Moffat(Eds.) ''Probing Human Origins.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: The American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gintis | first1 = H | year = 2007 | title = A framework for the unification of the behavioral sciences | url = http://www.umass.edu/preferen/gintis/Unity-BBS%20Print%20Version.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 1–61 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x07000581}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultures are defined by a suite of common traits shared by a large group of people. DIT theorists argue that this doesn't sufficiently explain variation in cultural traits at the individual level.  By contrast, DIT models human culture at the individual level and views culture as the result of a dynamic evolutionary process at the population level.&lt;ref name="Richerson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richerson, P. J. and R. Boyd.  2005. ''Not By Genes Alone: How Culture Transformed Human Evolution''.  Chicago: University of Chicago Press. pg. 5-8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human sociobiology and evolutionary psychology===

Evolutionary psychologists study the evolved architecture of the human mind. They see it as composed of many different programs that process information, each with assumptions and procedures that were specialized by natural selection to solve a different adaptive problem faced by our hunter-gatherer ancestors (e.g., choosing mates, hunting, avoiding predators, cooperating, using aggression).&lt;ref&gt;Barkow, J., Cosmides, L, &amp; Tooby, J. (1992) The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These evolved programs contain content-rich assumptions about how the world and other people work. As ideas are passed from mind to mind, they are changed by these evolved inference systems (much like messages get changed in a game of telephone). But the changes are not random. Evolved programs add and subtract information, reshaping the ideas in ways that make them more "intuitive", more memorable, and more attention-grabbing. In other words, "memes" (ideas) are not like genes. Genes are copied faithfully as they are replicated, but ideas are not. It’s not just that ideas mutate every once in awhile, like genes do. Ideas are transformed every time they are passed from mind to mind, because the sender's message is being interpreted by evolved inference systems in the receiver.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, P. (2001) Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought. Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sperber, D. (1996). Explaining Culture: A Naturalistic Approach. Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no necessary contradiction between evolutionary psychology and DIT, but evolutionary psychologists argue that the psychology implicit in many DIT models is too simple; evolved programs have a rich inferential structure not captured by the idea of a "content bias". They also argue that some of the phenomena DIT models attribute to cultural evolution are cases of "evoked culture"—situations in which different evolved programs are activated in different places, in response to cues in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Tooby, J. &amp; Cosmides, L., (1992) Psychological foundations of culture. In The Adapted Mind.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human [[sociobiology|sociobiologists]] try to understand how maximizing genetic fitness, in either the modern era or past environments, can explain human behavior. When faced with a trait that seems maladaptive, some sociobiologists try to determine how the trait actually increases genetic fitness (maybe through kin selection or by speculating about early evolutionary environments).  Dual inheritance theorists, in contrast, will consider a variety of genetic and cultural processes in addition to natural selection on genes.

===Human behavioral ecology===

[[Human behavioral ecology]] (HBE) and DIT have a similar relationship to what ecology and evolutionary biology have in the biological sciences.  HBE is more concerned about ecological process and DIT more focused on historical process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marwick|first1=Ben|title=Three styles of Darwinian evolution in the analysis of stone artefacts: Which one to use in mainland Southeast Asia?|journal=Australian Archaeology|date=2008|volume=67|pages=79–86|doi=10.1080/03122417.2008.11681880|jstor=40288025}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One difference is that human behavioral ecologists often assume that culture is a system that produces the most adaptive outcome in a given environment.  This implies that similar behavioral traditions should be found in similar environments.  However, this is not always the case.  A study of African cultures showed that cultural history was a better predictor of cultural traits than local ecological conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guglielmino | first1 = C. R. | last2 = Viganotti | first2 = C. | last3 = Hewlett | first3 = B. | last4 = Cavalli-Sforza | first4 = L.L. | year = 1995 | title = Cultural variation in Africa: role of mechanism of transmission and adaptation | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 7585–7589 | doi=10.1073/pnas.92.16.7585| pmc = 41384 | bibcode = 1995PNAS...92.7585G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memetics===

[[Memetics]], which comes from the [[meme]] idea described in [[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins's]] ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', is similar to DIT in that it treats culture as an evolutionary process that is distinct from genetic transmission.  However, there are some philosophical differences between memetics and DIT.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, R. and P.J. Richerson. 2000. [http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Richerson/CambMeme.PDF Memes: universal acid or better mouse trap].  In R. Aunger (Ed), ''Darwinizing Culture: The Status of Memetics as a Science''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 143–162.&lt;/ref&gt;   One difference is that memetics' focus is on the selection potential of discrete replicators (memes), where DIT allows for transmission of both non-replicators and non-discrete cultural variants.  DIT does not assume that replicators are necessary for cumulative adaptive evolution. DIT also more strongly emphasizes the role of genetic inheritance in shaping the capacity for cultural evolution.  But perhaps the biggest difference is a difference in academic lineage. [[Memetics]] as a label is more influential in popular culture than in academia. Critics of memetics argue that it is lacking in empirical support or is conceptually ill-founded, and question whether there is hope for the memetic research program succeeding. Proponents point out that many cultural traits are discrete, and that many existing models of cultural inheritance assume discrete cultural units, and hence involve memes.&lt;ref&gt;Laland, K. N. and G. R. Brown.  2002.  ''Sense &amp; Nonsense: Evolutionary Perspectives on Human Behavior.''  Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 289-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shortcomings and Criticisms==
{{expand section|date=February 2016}}
Serious criticisms have been levelled against DIT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gabora | first1 = L | year = 2008 | title = The cultural evolution of socially situated cognition | url = http://www.vub.ac.be/CLEA/liane/papers/ssc.htm | journal = Cognitive Systems Research | volume = 9 | issue = 1–2| pages = 104–113 | doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2007.05.004| arxiv = 0803.2568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gabora | first1 = L | year = 2011 | title = Five clarifications about cultural evolution | url = https://people.ok.ubc.ca/lgabora/papers/gabora-five-JOCC2011.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Cognition and Culture | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 61–83 | doi=10.1163/156853711x568699| arxiv = 1309.2622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabora, L. (2011).  [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mindbloggling/201105/how-generation-was-misled-about-natural-selection How a generation was misled about natural selection]. ''Psychology Today'', Mindbloggling.&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the term ‘dual inheritance’ to refer to not just traits that are transmitted by way of a self-assembly code (as in genetic evolution) but also traits that are ''not'' transmitted by way of a self-assembly code (as in cultural evolution) is misleading, because this second use does not capture the algorithmic structure that makes an inheritance system require a particular kind of mathematical framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gabora | first1 = L | year = 2013 | title = An evolutionary framework for culture: Selectionism versus communal exchange. | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571064513000213 | journal = Physics of Life Reviews | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 117-145 | doi=10.1016/j.plrev.2013.03.006 | arxiv = 1206.4386 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The population genetics framework was designed to solve the problem of how does evolution occur--i.e., how are fit traits preserved in a lineage--in a system wherein acquired change is discarded at the end of each generation. Darwin noticed that there are two kinds of traits: acquired traits (e.g., a tattoo, or knowledge of the layout of a particular city) which are discarded, while inherited traits (e.g., blood type) are preserved. His ingenious solution was to develop a population level explanation, and show that evolution was due to differential replication of heritable variation in response to selection. 
We now know that the reason for the distinction between these two kinds of traits is that some traits (inherited traits) are encoded in genes which collectively constitute self-assembly code and are transmitted to offspring, while all other traits (acquired traits) are shed at the end of a generation with the deaths of those who bore them.
Thus, the reason that horizontal transmission of ideas is algorithmically dissimilar to  vertical transmission (reproduction) in genetic evolution is that it does not provide a means of preserving fit traits in a system wherein those traits would otherwise be lost from the lineage.  
Proponents of DIT  argue that 1) even genetic evolution uses non-vertical transmission through the environmental alteration of the genome during life by acquired circumstance: [[epigenetics]], and 2) genetic evolution is also affected by direct horizontal transmission between separate species of plants and strains of bacteria: [[horizontal gene transfer]]. 
However, these arguments are irrelevant to the issue of whether a Darwinian (or selectionist, or population genetics) mathematical framework is appropriate to the description of cultural evolution, since these aspects of biological evolution are themselves not accommodated by such a framework. The point is that although it is not essential that ‘inherited traits’ be transmitted by way of ''genes'' (necessarily) for a population genetics framework to be applicable, but they need to be transmitted by way of a self-assembly code, or some other such mechanism that may exist out there in the universe that does the same thing: preserving traits that would otherwise be lost from a lineage due to the death of individuals.

The above criticism of DIT arises due to the choice of Darwinian selection as an explanatory framework for culture. Cultural evolution does not possess the algorithmic structure of a process that can be modeled in a Darwinian framework as characterized by [[John von Neumann]]&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann, J. (1966). ''The theory of self-reproducing automata''. University of Illinois Press, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; and used by [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]] to design the [[genetic algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, J. (1975). ''Adaptation in natural and artificial systems''. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Forcing culture into a Darwinian framework gives a distorted picture of the process for several reasons. First, Darwinian selection only works as an explanatory framework when variation is randomly generated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} To the extent that transmission biases are operative in culture, they mitigate the effect of Darwinian change, i.e. change in the distribution of variants over generations of exposure to selective pressures.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Second, since acquired change can accumulate orders of magnitude faster than inherited change, if it is not getting regularly discarded each generation, it quickly overwhelms the population-level mechanism of change identified by Darwin; it ‘swamps the phylogenetic signal’. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
DIT proponents reply that their theory includes a very important role for decision-making forces.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, R. and Richerson, P.J. (1985) ''Culture and the Evolutionary Process'', Chicago University Press&lt;/ref&gt; As a point of history, Darwin had a rather sophisticated theory of human cultural evolution that depended on natural selection "to a subordinate degree" compared to "laws, customs, and traditions" supported by public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1874 (1902). ''The Descent of Man'', second edition. American Home Library. See especially chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Critics do not see the relevance of this reply to the point they are making. When critics claim that DIT is too "Darwinian" they are claiming that culture does not have the algorithmic structure of the kind of process that the formalisms of population genetics were developed to capture.

A related problem stems from the reconstructive manner in which ideas are encoded and retrieved from memory, and the fact that ideas are interpreted in terms of existing conceptual structure and creatively adapted to their bearer's needs, views, and tastes prior to cultural transmission. This means that what biologists call 'acquired change' is ubiquitous in culture, and the population genetics framework was specifically developed to describe the evolution of inherited change in a system where acquired change is regularly discarded from the lineage. Proponents argue "But if this criticism was valid then it would be comparatively much easier to argue an unpopular or incorrect concepts than it actually is." Critics do not know what they mean by this. Proponents also claim, "In addition, nothing about DIT runs counter to the idea that an internally selective process (some would call creativity) also determines the fitness of ideas received and sent.  In fact this decision making is a large part of the territory embraced by DIT proponents but is poorly understood due to limitations in neurobiology (for more information see [[Neural Darwinism]])." Critics, however, do not view creativity as an "internally selective process", and their criticism has nothing to do with whether creativity "determines the fitness of ideas received and sent." (They also point out that there is a vast psychological literature on decision making; it would only appear to be "poorly understood" to someone whose only source for papers on decision making is the literature on Neural Darwinism.) The point critics are making in regard to creativity is that creativity introduces acquired change which is not handled by a selectionist, or Darwinian, or population genetics (it doesn't matter what you call it) type of mathematical framework.

'''Engineering change orders''' ('''ECO''') are used for changes in components, assemblies, or documents such as processes and work instructions.  They may also be used for changes in specifications. Lastly, it can be "a modification that will have an effect on a manufactured product or manufacturing process."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.randgroup.com/insights/evaluating-impacts-engineering-change-order/|title=Engineering Change Order: A Simple Explanation For Why You Need One|date=2014-10-09|work=Rand Group|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ECOs are also called an "engineering change note", engineering change notice (ECN), or just an engineering change (EC). 

In a typical system development cycle, the specification or the implementation is likely to change during engineering development or during integration of the system elements. These last-minute design changes are commonly referred to as engineering change orders (ECOs) and affect the functionality of a design after it has been wholly or partially completed. ECOs can compensate for design errors found during debug or changes that are made to the design specification to compensate for design problems in other areas of the system design. When improperly managed, engineering change orders can vastly increase costs. 

==Generic Engineering Change Order==
In product development the need for change is caused by:
* Correction of a design error that doesn't become evident until testing and modeling, or customer use reveals it.
* A change in the customers' requirements necessitating the redesign of part of the product
* A change in material or manufacturing method.  This can be caused by a lack of material availability, a change in vendor, or to compensate for a design error.  

"[A] document approved by the design activity that describes and authorizes the implementation of an engineering change to the product and its approved configuration documentation".&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Fletcher J. (1996)  Implementing Configuration Management: Hardware, Software and Firmware.  2nd Edition.  IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ECO must contain at least this information:&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, David G. (2009) The Mechanical Design Process, Mc Graw Hill, 4th edition .&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identification of what needs to be changed. This should include the part number and name of the component and reference to the drawings that show the component in detail or assembly.
* Reason(s) for the change.
* Description of the change. This includes a drawing of the component before and after the change. Generally, these drawings are only of the detail affected by the change. 
* List of documents and departments affected by the change. The most important part of making a change is to see that all pertinent groups are notified and all documents updated. 
* Approval of the change. As with the detail and assembly drawings, the changes must be approved by management.
* Instruction about when to introduce the change—immediately (scrapping current inventory), during the next production run, or at some other milestone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidullman.com/images/MDPTemplates/24ECN.docx A free Word template with fields for this information is available associated with Ullman.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chip design==
In chip design, ECO is the process of inserting a logic change directly into the netlist after it has already been processed by an automatic tool.  Before the chip masks are made, ECOs are usually done to save time, by avoiding the need for full [[ASIC]] [[logic synthesis]], technology mapping, [[Placement (EDA)|place]], [[Routing (EDA)|route]], [[layout extraction]], and [[static timing analysis|timing verification]].  EDA tools are often built with incremental modes of operation to facilitate this type of ECO.

After masks have been made, ECOs may be done to save money.  If a change can be implemented by modifying only a few of the layers (typically metal) then the cost is much less than it would be if the design was re-built from scratch.  This is because starting the process from the beginning will almost always require new [[photomask]]s for all layers, and each of the 20 or so masks in a modern [[semiconductor fabrication]] process is quite expensive.  A change implemented by modifying only a few layers is typically called a ''metal-mask'' ECO or a ''post-mask'' ECO.  Designers often sprinkle a design with unused logic gates, and EDA tools have specialized commands, to make this process easier.

One of the most common ECOs in ASIC design is the '''gate-level netlist ECO'''. In this flow, engineers manually (and often tediously) hand-edit the gate-level netlist, instead of re-running logic synthesis. The netlist files have to be searched for the logic affected by the change, the files need to be edited to implement the changes up and down the hierarchy, and the changes need to be tracked and verified to make sure exactly what needs to change gets changed and nothing more. This is a very time and resource-intensive process that is easily subject to errors.  Therefore [[formal equivalence checking]] is normally used after ECOs to ensure the revised implementation matches the revised specification.

With [[time-to-market]] pressures and rising mask costs in the [[semiconductor industry]], several [[electronic design automation]] (EDA) companies are beginning to bring more automation into the ECO implementation process. Most popular [[Placement (EDA)|place]] and [[Routing (EDA)|route]] products have some level of built-in ECO routing to help with implementing physical-level ECOs. [[Cadence Design Systems]] has recently announced a product called ''conformal ECO designer'', that automates the creation of Functional ECOs, usually the most tedious process in implementing an ECO. It uses [[formal equivalence checking]] and [[logic synthesis]] techniques to produce a gate-level ECO netlist based on the changed RTL. [[Synopsys]] in the past had a product called ''ECO compiler'' that is now defunct. Synopsys now has ''primetime-ECO'' for dealing with ECOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.synopsys.com/company/publications/synopsysinsight/pages/art2-signoffeco-issq3-11.aspx?cmp=insight-i3-2011-art2|title=Signoff-Driven ECO Guidance for Faster Timing Closure|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130203172359/http://www.synopsys.com/company/publications/synopsysinsight/pages/art2-signoffeco-issq3-11.aspx?cmp=insight-i3-2011-art2|archive-date=2013-02-03|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2012-06-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tweaker-F1 &amp; Tweaker-T1 have also come into the limelight in the recent [[Design Automation Conference|DAC-2012]] for their ECO algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deepchip.com/gadfly/gad053112.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telecommunications Industry==
The telecommunications industry has a formal process that takes elements of the ECO and other considerations and combines them into the "product change notice" (PCN). After telecommunications products have been generally available and/or in service for a period of time, it often becomes necessary for suppliers to introduce changes to those products. As a result of implementing these changes – regardless of who performs the actual work – the telecommunications carriers are significantly impacted with respect to labor and resources, etc. Thus, it is imperative that changes to these products are accurately reported and tracked through completion, according to the needs and requirements of the carriers.

The term "product change" includes changes to hardware, software, and firmware that occur over the entire life of a product. Product changes include those considered reportable and non-reportable. These changes may be applied by a supplier, a customer, or a contractor retained by the customer, depending on negotiated agreements. Fundamentally, the customer's goal is to ensure there is a process by which there is accurate and efficient tracking and reporting of changes to products. 

Changes are considered reportable when they affect the performance or life span of a product. Such changes include any that affect the form, fit, function, or the product technical specification (i.e., documentation) of the product. The desire for supplier or customer traceability may result in a reportable change.

The entire PCN process is documented in [http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-209&amp; GR-209], Issue 6, ''Generic Requirements for Product Change Notices (PCNs)''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2867">In [[fluid dynamics]], the '''enstrophy''' {{mathcal|E}} can be interpreted as another type of [[potential density]]; or, more concretely, the quantity directly related to the [[kinetic energy]] in the flow model that corresponds to [[dissipation]] effects in the fluid. It is particularly useful in the study of [[turbulence|turbulent flows]], and is often identified in the study of [[Electrostatic ion thruster|thruster]]s as well as the field of [[combustion]] theory.

The enstrophy can be described as the integral of the square of the [[vorticity]] ''ω'',&lt;ref&gt;Doering, C. R. and Gibbon, J. D. (1995). ''Applied Analysis of the Navier-Stokes Equations'', p. 11, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. {{ISBN|052144568-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E}(\boldsymbol \omega) \equiv \int_{S} |\boldsymbol \omega|^2 \,dS \,. &lt;/math&gt;

or, in terms of the [[flow velocity]],

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E}(\mathbf{u}) \equiv \int_{S} |\nabla \times \mathbf u|^2 \,dS \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Here, since the curl gives a [[scalar field]] in two dimensions ([[vortex]]) corresponding to the vector-valued [[velocity]] solving in the incompressible [[Navier–Stokes equations]], we can integrate its square over a surface ''S'' to retrieve a [[continuous linear operator]] on the space of possible velocity fields, known as a ''current''. This equation is however somewhat misleading. Here we have chosen a simplified version of the enstrophy derived from the [[Incompressible fluid|incompressibility condition]], which is equivalent to vanishing divergence of the velocity field,

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0 \,. &lt;/math&gt;

More generally, when not restricted to the incompressible condition, or to two spatial dimensions, the enstrophy may be computed by:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E}(\mathbf{u}) = \int_{S} \bigl|\nabla (\mathbf{u})\bigr|^2 \,dS \,. &lt;/math&gt;

where 

:&lt;math&gt; \bigl|\nabla (\mathbf{u})\bigr| &lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Frobenius norm]] of the gradient of the velocity field '''u'''.

'''Explorer 32''', also known as '''Atmosphere Explorer-B''' ('''AE-B'''), was a [[satellite]] launched by the United States to study the [[Earth's atmosphere|Earth's upper atmosphere]]. It was launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] on a [[Delta rocket|Delta-C1 rocket]], on May 25, 1966.  It was the second of five Atmosphere Explorers, the first being [[Explorer 17]].

==Technical specifications==
Explorer 32 was a stainless steel, vacuum-sealed sphere, {{convert|0.889|m|ft}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=NSSDC-1966-044A&gt;{{cite web|title=NSSDC/COSPAR ID: 1966-044A|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1966-044A|website=NSSDC Master Catalog Search|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It carried one [[ion]]{{Explain|date=May 2017}} and two neutral [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]]s, three [[magnetron]] density gauges, and two electrostatic probes. It used a [[tape recorder]] to save data that was acquired when the satellite was not in range of one of the 13 [[ground station]]s.  It was powered by [[silver-oxide battery|silver-zinc batteries]] and a [[solar cell]] array.

The satellite had an operational life of 10 months.  The two neutral mass spectrometers failed a few days after launch, but the remaining instruments operated throughout most of the satellite's lifetime.  Explorer 32 suffered a depressurization which led to battery failure, at which point it ceased functioning.&lt;ref name=NSSDC-1966-044A/&gt;

==Scientific experiments==
Explorer 32 was designed to directly measure the [[temperature]], composition, [[density]], and [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]] of the upper atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atmosphere and Earth Sciences|url=http://www.planet4589.org/space/misc/explorer.html|website=planet4589.org|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''ion [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]]s'' measured the concentrations of different types of [[ion]]s in the topside [[ionosphere]], principally atomic [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]].  The concentrations were recorded as a function of time, location, and [[Solar variation|solar]] and [[Earth's magnetic field|geomagnetic]] activity.  The satellite was able to perform a global study of the [[day|diurnal]] variation of the atmosphere during nearly two complete diurnal cycles, since the orbit plane [[precession|precessed]] one revolution each 5.5 months. The data from the ion mass spectrometers allowed for studies of: (1) the diurnal and seasonal variation of atmospheric ion composition, (2) the effect of atmospheric winds on the atomic hydrogen-atomic oxygen ion transition level, (3) the density and temporal variation of thermospheric atomic hydrogen, and (4) the altitude variation of ion composition in the midlatitude trough region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ion Mass Spectrometer: NSSDC ID: 1966-044A-01 |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1966-044A-01 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=13 June 2018}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three ''magnetron density gauges'' measured the density of the neutral atmosphere as a function of [[altitude]], time, [[latitude]], and solar and geomagnetic activity.&lt;ref name=JournalGeophysical&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JA075i016p03200/abstract|title=In situ measurements of neutral and electron density wave structure from the Explorer 32 satellite|accessdate=15 April 2015 | doi=10.1029/JA075i016p03200|bibcode=1970JGR....75.3200D|volume=75|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|pages=3200–3210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''electron temperature and density'' instrument measure the distribution of electron temperatures and densities using a swept voltage electron probe.&lt;ref name=JournalGeophysical/&gt;

The two ''neutral particle magnetic mass spectrometers'' were intended to measure the composition of the neutral atmosphere at altitudes between {{convert|285 and 1000|km|ft}}. One spectrometer failed after 4 days, and the other failed after 7 days in orbit.

The ''satellite [[drag (physics)|drag]] atmospheric density'' experiment measured the density of the upper atmosphere as a function of altitude, latitude, season, and solar activity.  The experiment was possible due to the symmetrical shape of Explorer 32.  When the satellite was near [[perigee]], it was observed by networks of ground-based [[Schmidt camera|Baker-Nunn camera]]s, as well as being tracked by radio and radar.  Sequences of these observations were used to deduce the density of the atmosphere that the satellite was passing through.&lt;ref name=Newton-Resolution&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JA074i026p06409/abstract|title=Resolution of the difference between atmospheric density measurements from Explorer 17 satellite by density gage and drag techniques|accessdate=15 April 2015 | doi=10.1029/JA074i026p06409|bibcode=1969JGR....74.6409N|volume=74|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|pages=6409–6414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frederic William Harmer''' FGS, FRMetS (24 April 1835 &amp;ndash; 24 April 1923) was an English amateur geologist, palaeontologist, and naturalist.&lt;ref name=WhoWho&gt;{{cite journal|title=Harmer, Frederic Harmer|year=1920|journal=Who's Who|page= 1142|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3452408;view=1up;seq=1192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Norwich]] and was educated at [[Norwich Grammar School]].

{{blockquote|In his early years he had only scanty leisure to devote to geology, but a chance encounter with the younger [[Searles Valentine Wood|Searles Wood]] was the beginning of a long-continued geological partnership. The map they prepared of the glacial deposits of Norfolk and Suffolk on a scale of 1 [[inch]] to the [[mile]] was the first 'drift' map of the kind in the world. After the publication of much valuable material on the Pleistocene deposits of the east of England, came Wood's death in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=F. W. Harmer (1835–1923)|journal=Nature|volume=135|issue=|page=611|date=20 April 1935|doi=10.1038/135611b0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Harmer was the mayor of Norwich in 1887–1888 and served there as an alderman from 1880 to 1902.&lt;ref name=WhoWho/&gt; After about a decade of inactivity in geological work, he presented in 1895 at the meeting of the [[British Association]] at Ipswich two important papers on the Coralline and Red Crags. From 1895 until his death, he actively pursued field work in geology.&lt;ref name=Obit&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kendall, Percy F.|authorlink=Percy Fry Kendall|date=9 June 1923|title=Obituary. Mr. F. W. Harmer|journal=Nature|pages=779–780|issue=2797|volume=111|doi=10.1038/111779a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Murchison Medal]] in 1902.

He made extensive investigations of the [[Pliocene]] and [[Pleistocene]] deposits in England's eastern and midland counties, as well as those deposits in Belgium and the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=WhoWho/&gt; The ''Société géologique de Belgique'' elected him an honorary member. The University of Cambridge conferred upon him an honorary M.A.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;

He married Mary Young Lyon in 1860. The marriage produced several children, among whom were the surgeon William Douglas Harmer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harmer, William Douglas (1873–1962)|website=Plarr's Lives of the Fellows Online|url=http://livesonline.rcseng.ac.uk/biogs/E005034b.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the zoologist Sir [[Sidney Frederic Harmer]].&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;

Ehret was born in [[Germany]] to Ferdinand Christian Ehret, a gardener and competent draughtsman, and Anna Maria Ehret.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.illustratedgarden.org/mobot/rarebooks/author.asp?creator=Ehret,%20Georg%20Dionysus&amp;creatorID=97 MBG Rare Books: Author - Ehret, Georg Dionysus&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning his working life as a gardener's apprentice near [[Heidelberg]], he became one of the most influential European botanical artists of all time. His first illustrations were in collaboration with [[Carl Linnaeus]] and [[George Clifford III|George Clifford]] in 1735-1736. Clifford, a wealthy Dutch banker and governor of the [[Dutch East India Company]] was a keen botanist with a large [[herbarium]]. He had the income to attract the talents of botanists such as Linnaeus and artists like Ehret. Together at the Clifford estate, [[Hartecamp]], which is located south of [[Haarlem]] in [[Heemstede]] near [[Bennebroek]], they produced ''[[Hortus Cliffortianus]]'' in 1738, a masterpiece of early botanical literature.

As a result of exploitation by [[Johann Wilhelm Weinmann]], Ehret finished only 500 plates of a 1,000 plate commission and moved to [[England]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciweb.nybg.org/Science2/Onlinexhibits/exhbtcata.html Plants and Gardens Portrayed: Rare and Illustrated Books from The LuEsther T&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; where he illustrated many of the more spectacular plants that were in cultivation. His original art work may be found at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London, the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], [[The Royal Society]], London, the Lindley Library at the [[Royal Horticultural Society]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], at the University Library of [[Erlangen]], and the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation in Pittsburgh, PA.

The genus ''[[Ehretia]]'' was named in his honour.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3244">'''Giant resonance''' is a high-frequency collective [[Excited state|excitation]] of [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]], as a property of many-body quantum systems. In the macroscopic interpretation of such an excitation in terms of an oscillation, the most prominent giant resonance is a collective oscillation of all [[proton]]s against all [[neutron]]s in a nucleus.

In 1947, [[George C. Baldwin | G. C. Baldwin]] and G. S. Klaiber observed the giant dipole resonance (GDR) in photonuclear reactions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldwin|first1=G.|last2=Klaiber|first2=G.|title=Photo-Fission in Heavy Elements|journal=Physical Review|volume=71|issue=1|pages=3–10|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.71.3|bibcode = 1947PhRv...71....3B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chomaz, section 2.1&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1972 the giant quadrupole resonance (GQR) was discovered,&lt;ref&gt;Chomaz, section 2.2.1.1&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1977 the giant monopole resonance (GMR) was discovered in medium and heavy nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;Chomaz, section 2.2.2.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Giant dipole resonance==
Giant dipole resonances may result in a number of de-excitation events, such as [[nuclear fission]], emission of neutrons or gamma rays, or combinations of these.

Giant dipole resonances can be caused by any mechanism that imparts enough energy to the nucleus. Classical causes are irradiation with [[gamma ray]]s at energies from 7 to 40 MeV, which couple to nuclei and either cause or increase the dipole moment of the nucleus by adding energy that separates charges in the nucleus. The process is the inverse of [[gamma decay]], but the energies involved are typically much larger, and the dipole moments induced are larger than occur in the excited nuclear states that cause the average gamma decay. 

High energy electrons of &gt;50 MeV may cause the same phenomenon, by coupling to the nucleus via a "virtual gamma photon", in a nuclear reaction that is the inverse (i.e., reverse) of [[internal conversion]] decay.

A '''helioscope''' is an instrument used in observing the [[sun]] and [[sunspots]]. 
The helioscope was first used by [[Benedetto Castelli]] (1578-1643) and refined by [[Galileo]] (1564–1642). The method involves projecting an image of the sun onto a white sheet of paper suspended in a darkened room with the use of a telescope.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.museogalileo.it/indepth/Helioscope.html Helioscope] - Museo Galileo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.museogalileo.it/multimedia/Helioscope.html Helioscope video] - Museo Galileo&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ''machina helioscopica'' or helioscope was designed by [[Christoph Scheiner]] (1575 –1650) to assist his [[sunspot]] observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheiner|first=Christoph|title=[http://fermi.imss.fi.it/rd/bdv?/bdviewer/bid=000000367767&amp;lng=en Rosa Ursina]|date=1630|pages=137–8}} (Latin)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hipparchus of Nicaea''' ({{IPAc-en|h|ɪ|ˈ|p|ɑr|k|ə|s}}; {{lang-el|Ἵππαρχος}}, ''Hipparkhos''; {{c. |lk=no|190|120}}&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}) was a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[astronomer]], [[geographer]], and [[mathematician]]. He is considered the founder of [[trigonometry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From Eudoxus to Einstein: a history of mathematical astronomy |author=C. M. Linton |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-82750-8 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is most famous for his incidental discovery of [[precession of the equinoxes]].&lt;ref&gt;G J Toomer's chapter "Ptolemy and his Greek Predecessors" in "Astronomy before the Telescope", British Museum Press, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hipparchus was born in [[Nicaea]], [[Bithynia]] (now [[İznik]], [[Turkey]]), and probably died on the island of [[Rhodes]]. He is known to have been a working astronomer at least from 162 to 127&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PsLArVtOsPYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22astronomies+and+Cultures+in+early+medieval+europe%22 |title=Astronomies and cultures in early medieval Europe|author=Stephen C. McCluskey|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2000|page= 22 |isbn=9780521778527}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hipparchus is considered the greatest ancient astronomical observer and, by some, the greatest overall astronomer of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]. He was the first whose quantitative and accurate models for the motion of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] survive. For this he certainly made use of the observations and perhaps the mathematical techniques accumulated over centuries by the [[Babylonia]]ns and by [[Meton of Athens]] (5th century {{sc|bc}}), [[Timocharis]], [[Aristyllus]], [[Aristarchus of Samos]] and [[Eratosthenes]], among others.&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Alexander Raymond |title=Hipparchus |date=2017 |publisher=Encyclopedia Brittanica, Inc. |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hipparchus-Greek-astronomer |accessdate=25 August 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806143034/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hipparchus-Greek-astronomer |archivedate=6 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed trigonometry and constructed trigonometric tables, and he solved several problems of [[spherical trigonometry]]. With his solar and [[lunar theory|lunar]] theories and his trigonometry, he may have been the first to develop a reliable method to predict [[solar eclipse]]s. His other reputed achievements include the discovery and measurement of Earth's precession, the compilation of the first comprehensive [[star catalog]] of the western world, and possibly the invention of the [[astrolabe]], also of the [[armillary sphere]], which he used during the creation of much of the star catalogue.

==Life and work==
Relatively little of Hipparchus's direct work survives into modern times. Although he wrote at least fourteen books, only his commentary on the popular astronomical poem by [[Aratus]] was preserved by later copyists. Most of what is known about Hipparchus comes from [[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica|Geography]]'' and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'' in the 1st century; [[Ptolemy]]'s 2nd-century ''[[Almagest]]''; and additional references to him in the 4th century by [[Pappus of Alexandria]] and [[Theon of Alexandria]] in their commentaries on the ''Almagest''.&lt;ref&gt;For general information on Hipparchus see the following biographical articles: [[G. J. Toomer]], "Hipparchus" (1978); and A. Jones, "Hipparchus."&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a strong tradition that Hipparchus was born in Nicaea (Greek ''Νίκαια''), in the ancient district of [[Bithynia]] (modern-day Iznik in province [[Bursa Province|Bursa]]), in what today is the country [[Turkey]].

The exact dates of his life are not known, but Ptolemy attributes to him astronomical observations in the period from 147–127&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, and some of these are stated as made in Rhodes; earlier observations since 162&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} might also have been made by him. His birth date ({{c.|lk=no|190}}&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}) was calculated by [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre|Delambre]] based on clues in his work. Hipparchus must have lived some time after 127&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} because he analyzed and published his observations from that year. Hipparchus obtained information from [[Alexandria]] as well as [[Babylon]], but it is not known when or if he visited these places. He is believed to have died on the island of [[Rhodes]], where he seems to have spent most of his later life.

It is not known what Hipparchus's economic means were nor how he supported his scientific activities. His appearance is likewise unknown: there are no contemporary portraits. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries [[coin]]s were made in his honour in [[Bithynia]] that bear his name and show him with a [[globe]]; this supports the tradition that he was born there.

Hipparchus is thought to be the first to calculate a heliocentric system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hipparchus of Nicea|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Hipparchus_of_Nicea/|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=June 5, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605021909/http://www.ancient.eu/Hipparchus_of_Nicea/|archivedate=5 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he abandoned his work because the calculations showed the orbits were not perfectly circular as believed to be mandatory by the science of the time. As an astronomer of antiquity, his influence, supported by ideas from Aristotle, held sway for nearly 2000 years, until the [[Copernican heliocentrism|heliocentric model of Copernicus]].

Hipparchus's only preserved work is ''Τῶν Ἀράτου καὶ Εὐδόξου φαινομένων ἐξήγησις'' ("Commentary on the Phaenomena of Eudoxus and Aratus"). This is a highly critical commentary in the form of two books on a popular [[poem]] by [[Aratus]] based on the work by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]].&lt;ref&gt;Modern edition: [[Karl Manitius]] (''In Arati et Eudoxi Phaenomena'', Leipzig, 1894).&lt;/ref&gt; Hipparchus also made a list of his major works, which apparently mentioned about fourteen books, but which is only known from references by later authors. His famous star catalog was incorporated into the one by Ptolemy, and may be almost perfectly reconstructed by subtraction of two and two thirds degrees from the longitudes of Ptolemy's stars. The first trigonometric table was apparently compiled by Hipparchus, who is now consequently known as "the father of trigonometry".

===Modern speculation===
Hipparchus was in the international news in 2005, when it was again proposed (as in 1898) that the data on the [[celestial globe]] of Hipparchus or in his star catalog may have been preserved in the only surviving large ancient celestial globe which depicts the constellations with moderate accuracy, the globe carried by the [[Farnese Atlas]]. There are a variety of mis-steps&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dioi.org/ggg.htm D.Rawlins] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521202120/http://www.dioi.org/ggg.htm |date=21 May 2006 }}, "Farnese Atlas Celestial Globe, Proposed Astronomical Origins", 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; in the more ambitious 2005 paper, thus no specialists in the area accept its widely publicized speculation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phys.lsu.edu/farnese/ B. E. Schaefer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050114015015/http://www.phys.lsu.edu/farnese/ |date=14 January 2005 }}, "Epoch of the Constellations on the Farnese Atlas and their Origin in Hipparchus's Lost Catalog", ''[[Journal for the History of Astronomy]]'', May, 2005 versus [http://www.people.scs.fsu.edu/~dduke/farnese Dennis Duke] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814033601/http://people.scs.fsu.edu/~dduke/farnese |date=14 August 2007 }} ''[[Journal for the History of Astronomy]]'', February, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucio Russo]] has said that [[Plutarch]], in his work ''On the Face in the Moon'', was reporting some physical theories that we consider to be [[Newtonian physics|Newtonian]] and that these may have come originally from Hipparchus;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucio Russo]], ''The Forgotten Revolution: How Science Was Born in 300&amp;nbsp;BCE and Why It Had To Be Reborn'', (Berlin: Springer, 2004). {{ISBN|3-540-20396-6}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;286–293.&lt;/ref&gt; he goes on to say that Newton may have been influenced by them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucio Russo]], ''The Forgotten Revolution: How Science Was Born in 300&amp;nbsp;BCE and Why It Had To Be Reborn'', (Berlin: Springer, 2004). {{ISBN|3-540-20396-6}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;365–379.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one book review, both of these claims have been rejected by other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Mott Greene, "The birth of modern science?" Review of ''The Forgotten Revolution'', ''Nature'' '''430''' (5 August 2004): 614.&lt;/ref&gt;

A line in Plutarch's ''Table Talk'' states that Hipparchus counted 103049 compound propositions that can be formed from ten simple propositions. 103049 is the tenth [[Schröder–Hipparchus number]], which counts the number of ways of adding one or more pairs of parentheses around consecutive subsequences of two or more items in any sequence of ten symbols. This has led to speculation that Hipparchus knew about [[enumerative combinatorics]], a field of mathematics that developed independently in modern mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Babylonian sources==
{{further|Babylonian astronomy}}
Earlier Greek astronomers and mathematicians were influenced by Babylonian astronomy to some extent, for instance the period relations of the [[Metonic cycle]] and [[Saros cycle]] may have come from Babylonian sources (see "[[Babylonian astronomical diaries]]"). Hipparchus seems to have been the first to exploit Babylonian astronomical knowledge and techniques systematically.&lt;ref&gt;For more information see [[G. J. Toomer]], "Hipparchus and Babylonian astronomy."&lt;/ref&gt; Except for [[Timocharis]] and [[Aristillus]], he was the first Greek known to divide the circle in 360 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] of 60 [[arc minute]]s ([[Eratosthenes]] before him used a simpler [[sexagesimal]] system dividing a circle into 60 parts). He also used the Babylonian unit ''pechus'' ("cubit") of about 2° or 2.5°.

Hipparchus probably compiled a list of Babylonian astronomical observations; [[G. J. Toomer]], a historian of astronomy, has suggested that Ptolemy's knowledge of eclipse records and other Babylonian observations in the ''Almagest'' came from a list made by Hipparchus. Hipparchus's use of Babylonian sources has always been known in a general way, because of Ptolemy's statements. However, [[Franz Xaver Kugler]] demonstrated that the synodic and anomalistic periods that Ptolemy attributes to Hipparchus had already been used in Babylonian [[ephemerides]], specifically the collection of texts nowadays called "System B" (sometimes attributed to [[Kidinnu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Franz Xaver Kugler, ''Die Babylonische Mondrechnung'' ("The Babylonian lunar computation"), Freiburg im Breisgau, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hipparchus's long [[orbital period|draconitic]] lunar period (5,458 months = 5,923 lunar nodal periods) also appears a few times in [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Asger|last=Aaboe|authorlink=Asger Aaboe|title=On the Babylonian origin of some Hipparchian parameters|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0498.1955.tb00619.x|journal=Centaurus|volume=4|issue=2|pages=122–125|year=1955|bibcode = 1955Cent....4..122A }}. On p. 124, Aaboe identifies the Hipparchian equation 5458 syn. mo. = 5923 drac. mo. with the equation of 1,30,58 syn. mo. = 1,38,43 drac. mo. (written in [[sexagesimal]]) which he cites to p. 73 of Neugebauer's ''Astronomical Cuneiform Texts'', London 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; But the only such tablet explicitly dated is post-Hipparchus so the direction of transmission is not settled by the tablets.

Hipparchus's draconitic lunar motion cannot be solved by the lunar-four arguments that are sometimes proposed to explain his anomalistic motion. A solution that has produced the exact {{frac|5,458|5,923}} ratio is rejected by most historians though it uses the only anciently attested method of determining such ratios, and it automatically delivers the ratio's four-digit numerator and denominator. Hipparchus initially used (''Almagest'' 6.9) his 141 BC eclipse with a Babylonian eclipse of 720 BC to find the less accurate ratio 7,160 synodic months = 7,770 draconitic months, simplified by him to 716 = 777 through division by 10. (He similarly found from the 345-year cycle the ratio 4267 synodic months = 4573 anomalistic months and divided by 17 to obtain the standard ratio 251 synodic months = 269 anomalistic months.) If he sought a longer time base for this draconitic investigation he could use his same 141 BC eclipse with a moonrise 1245 BC eclipse from Babylon, an interval of 13,645 synodic months = {{frac|14,8807|1|2}} draconitic months ≈ {{frac|14,623|1|2}} anomalistic months. Dividing by {{frac|5|2}} produces 5458 synodic months = 5923 precisely.&lt;ref&gt;Pro &amp; con arguments are given at [http://www.dioi.org/vols/wb1.pdf ''DIO'' volume 11 number 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426141646/http://www.dioi.org/vols/wb1.pdf |date=26 April 2015 }} article 3 sections C &amp; D.&lt;/ref&gt; The obvious main objection is that the early eclipse is unattested though that is not surprising in itself and there is no consensus on whether Babylonian observations were recorded this remotely. Though Hipparchus's tables formally went back only to 747 BC, 600 years before his era, the tables were actually good back to before the eclipse in question because as only recently noted&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.dioi.org/thr.htm#bvmr demonstration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105220/http://www.dioi.org/thr.htm |date=2 April 2015 }} of reverse use of Hipparchus's table for the 1245 BCE eclipse.&lt;/ref&gt; their use in reverse is no more difficult than forwards.

==Geometry, trigonometry, and other mathematical techniques==
Hipparchus was recognized as the first mathematician known to have possessed a [[trigonometric table]], which he needed when computing the [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] of the [[orbit]]s of the Moon and Sun. He tabulated values for the [[chord (geometry)|chord]] function, which gives the length of the chord for each angle. He did this for a circle with a circumference of 21,600 and a radius (rounded) of 3438 units: this circle has a unit length of 1 arc minute along its perimeter. He tabulated the chords for angles with increments of 7.5°. In modern terms, the chord of an angle equals the radius times twice the [[trigonometric function|sine]] of half of the angle, i.e.:

:chord(''A'') = r(2&amp;nbsp;sin({{sfrac|''A''|2}})).

He described the chord table in a work, now lost, called ''Tōn en kuklō&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; eutheiōn'' (''Of Lines Inside a Circle'') by [[Theon of Alexandria]] in his 4th-century commentary on the ''Almagest'' I.10; some claim his table may have survived in astronomical treatises in India, for instance the ''[[Surya Siddhanta]]''. Trigonometry was a significant innovation, because it allowed Greek astronomers to solve any triangle, and made it possible to make quantitative astronomical models and predictions using their preferred geometric techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Toomer, "The Chord Table of Hipparchus" (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

For his chord table Hipparchus must have used a better approximation for [[pi|π]] than the one from [[Archimedes]] of between {{frac|3|1|7}} and {{frac|3|10|71}}; perhaps he had the one later used by Ptolemy: 3;8,30 ([[sexagesimal]]) (''Almagest'' VI.7); but it is not known if he computed an improved value himself.

But some scholars do not believe [[Āryabhaṭa's sine table]] has anything to do with Hipparchus's chord table which does not exist today. Some scholars do not agree with this hypothesis that Hipparchus constructed a chord table. Bo C. Klintberg states "With mathematical reconstructions and philosophical arguments I show that Toomer's 1973 paper never contained any conclusive evidence for his claims that Hipparchus had a 3438'-based chord table, and that the Indians used that table to compute their sine tables. Recalculating Toomer's reconstructions with a 3600' radius &amp;ndash; i.e. the radius of the chord table in Ptolemy's Almagest, expressed in 'minutes' instead of 'degrees' &amp;ndash; generates Hipparchan-like ratios similar to those produced by a 3438' radius. It is therefore possible that the radius of Hipparchus's chord table was 3600', and that the Indians independently constructed their 3438'-based sine table."&lt;ref&gt;Reference: Hipparchus's 3600'-Based Chord Table and Its Place in the History of Ancient Greek and Indian Trigonometry, Bo C. Klintberg, Indian Journal of History of Science 40 (2):169-203 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hipparchus could construct his chord table using the [[Pythagorean theorem]] and a [[theorem]] known to Archimedes. He also might have developed and used the theorem in [[Euclidean plane geometry|plane geometry]] called [[Ptolemy's theorem]], because it was proved by Ptolemy in his ''Almagest'' (I.10) (later elaborated on by [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot]]).

Hipparchus was the first to show that the [[stereographic projection]] is [[conformal map|conformal]], and that it transforms circles on the [[sphere]] that do not pass through the center of projection to circles on the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]]. This was the basis for the [[astrolabe]].

Besides geometry, Hipparchus also used [[arithmetic]] techniques developed by the [[Chaldea]]ns. He was one of the first Greek mathematicians to do this, and in this way expanded the techniques available to astronomers and geographers.

There are several indications that Hipparchus knew spherical trigonometry, but the first surviving text of it is that of [[Menelaus of Alexandria]] in the 1st century, who on that basis is now commonly credited with its discovery. (Previous to the finding of the proofs of Menelaus a century ago, Ptolemy was credited with the invention of spherical trigonometry.) Ptolemy later used spherical trigonometry to compute things like the rising and setting points of the [[ecliptic]], or to take account of the lunar [[parallax]]. Hipparchus may have used a globe for these tasks, reading values off coordinate grids drawn on it, or he may have made approximations from planar geometry, or perhaps used arithmetical approximations developed by the Chaldeans. He might have used spherical trigonometry.

Aubrey Diller has shown that the clima calculations which [[Strabo]] preserved from Hipparchus were performed by spherical trigonometry with the sole accurate obliquity known to have been used by ancient astronomers, 23°40'. All thirteen clima figures agree with Diller's proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Rawlins, [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w50.pdf "Aubrey Diller Legacies"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509041132/http://www.dioi.org/vols/w50.pdf |date=9 May 2010 }}, ''DIO'' 5 (2009); Shcheglov D.A.

===Motion of the Moon===
{{further|Lunar theory|Orbit of the Moon}}
Hipparchus also studied the motion of the [[Moon]] and confirmed the accurate values for two periods of its motion that Chaldean astronomers are widely presumed&lt;ref&gt;Detailed dissents on both values are presented in [http://www.dioi.org/vols/wb1.pdf ''DIO'' volume 11 number 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426141646/http://www.dioi.org/vols/wb1.pdf |date=26 April 2015 }} articles 1 &amp; 3 and [http://www.dioi.org/vols/wb1.pdf ''DIO'' volume 20]  article 3 section L. See also these analyses' [http://www.dioi.org/thr.htm summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105220/http://www.dioi.org/thr.htm |date=2 April 2015 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; to have possessed before him, whatever their ultimate [[Aristarchus of Samos|origin]]. The traditional value (from Babylonian System B) for the mean [[synodic month]] is 29&amp;nbsp;days; 31,50,8,20 (sexagesimal) = 29.5305941... days. Expressed as 29&amp;nbsp;days + 12&amp;nbsp;hours + {{sfrac|793|1080}}&amp;nbsp;hours this value has been used later in the [[Hebrew calendar]]. The Chaldeans also knew that 251 [[synodic month]]s ≈ 269 [[anomalistic month]]s.  Hipparchus used the multiple of this period by a factor of 17, because that interval is also an eclipse period, and is also close to an integer number of years (4267 moons : 4573 anomalistic periods : 4630.53 nodal periods : 4611.98 lunar orbits : 344.996 years : 344.982 solar orbits : 126,007.003 days : 126,351.985 rotations).&lt;ref&gt;These figures are for dynamical time, not the solar time of Hipparchus's era. E.g., the true 4267 year interval was nearer 126,007 days plus a little over a {{frac|1|2}} hour.&lt;/ref&gt; What was so exceptional and useful about the cycle was that all 345-year-interval eclipse pairs occur slightly over 126,007 days apart within a tight range of only about ±{{frac|1|2}} hour, guaranteeing (after division by 4267) an estimate of the synodic month correct to one part in order of magnitude 10 million. The 345 year periodicity is why&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dioi.org/vols/w60.pdf Footnote 18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426141452/http://www.dioi.org/vols/w60.pdf |date=26 April 2015 }} of ''DIO'' 6 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; the ancients could conceive of a ''mean'' month and quantify it so accurately that it is even today correct to a fraction of a second of time.

Hipparchus could confirm his computations by comparing eclipses from his own time (presumably 27 January 141&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} and 26 November 139&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} according to [Toomer 1980]), with eclipses from Babylonian records 345 years earlier (''Almagest'' IV.2; [A.Jones, 2001]). Already [[al-Biruni]] (''Qanun'' VII.2.II) and [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] (''de revolutionibus'' IV.4) noted that the period of 4,267 moons is actually about 5 minutes longer than the value for the eclipse period that Ptolemy attributes to Hipparchus. However, the timing methods of the Babylonians had an error of no less than 8 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson &amp; Fatoohi 1993; Steele ''et al.'' 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern scholars agree that Hipparchus rounded the eclipse period to the nearest hour, and used it to confirm the validity of the traditional values, rather than try to derive an improved value from his own observations. From modern ephemerides&lt;ref&gt;Chapront ''et al.'' 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and taking account of the change in the length of the day (see [[Delta T|ΔT]]) we estimate that the error in the assumed length of the synodic month was less than 0.2 seconds in the 4th century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} and less than 0.1 seconds in Hipparchus's time.

===Orbit of the Moon===
It had been known for a long time that the motion of the Moon is not uniform: its speed varies. This is called its ''anomaly'', and it repeats with its own period; the [[anomalistic month]]. The Chaldeans took account of this arithmetically, and used a table giving the daily motion of the Moon according to the date within a long period. The Greeks however preferred to think in geometrical models of the sky. [[Apollonius of Perga]] had at the end of the 3rd century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} proposed two models for lunar and planetary motion:
# In the first, the Moon would move uniformly along a circle, but the Earth would be eccentric, i.e., at some distance of the center of the circle. So the apparent angular speed of the Moon (and its distance) would vary.
# The Moon itself would move uniformly (with some mean motion in anomaly) on a secondary circular orbit, called an ''epicycle'', that itself would move uniformly (with some mean motion in longitude) over the main circular orbit around the Earth, called ''deferent''; see [[deferent and epicycle]]. Apollonius demonstrated that these two models were in fact mathematically equivalent. However, all this was theory and had not been put to practice. Hipparchus was the first astronomer we know attempted to determine the relative proportions and actual sizes of these orbits.

Hipparchus devised a geometrical method to find the parameters from three positions of the Moon, at particular phases of its anomaly. In fact, he did this separately for the eccentric and the epicycle model. Ptolemy describes the details in the ''Almagest'' IV.11. Hipparchus used two sets of three lunar eclipse observations, which he carefully selected to satisfy the requirements. The eccentric model he fitted to these eclipses from his Babylonian eclipse list: 22/23&amp;nbsp;December 383&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, 18/19&amp;nbsp;June 382&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, and 12/13&amp;nbsp;December 382&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}. The epicycle model he fitted to lunar eclipse observations made in Alexandria at 22&amp;nbsp;September 201&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, 19&amp;nbsp;March 200&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, and 11&amp;nbsp;September 200&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}.
* For the eccentric model, Hipparchus found for the ratio between the radius of the [[eccenter]] and the distance between the center of the eccenter and the center of the ecliptic (i.e., the observer on Earth): 3144 : {{frac|327|2|3}} ;
* and for the epicycle model, the ratio between the radius of the deferent and the epicycle: {{frac|3122|1|2}} : {{frac|247|1|2}} .
The somewhat weird numbers are due to the cumbersome unit he used in his chord table according to one group of historians, who explain their reconstruction's inability to agree with these four numbers as partly due to some sloppy rounding and calculation errors by Hipparchus, for which Ptolemy criticised him (he himself made rounding errors too). A simpler alternate reconstruction&lt;ref&gt;
Summarized in Hugh Thurston (2002): ''Isis'' '''93''', 58–69.&lt;/ref&gt; agrees with all four numbers. Anyway, Hipparchus found inconsistent results; he later used the ratio of the epicycle model ({{frac|3122|1|2}} : {{frac|247|1|2}}), which is too small (60 : 4;45 sexagesimal). Ptolemy established a ratio of 60 : {{frac|5|1|4}}.&lt;ref&gt;Toomer, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; (The maximum angular deviation producible by this geometry is the arcsin of {{frac|5|1|4}} divided by 60, or about 5° 1', a figure that is sometimes therefore quoted as the equivalent of the Moon's [[equation of the center]] in the Hipparchan model.)

===Apparent motion of the Sun===
Before Hipparchus, [[Meton]], [[Euctemon]], and their pupils at [[Athens]] had made a solstice observation (i.e., timed the moment of the summer [[solstice]]) on 27 June 432&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} ([[proleptic Julian calendar]]). [[Aristarchus of Samos]] is said to have done so in 280&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, and Hipparchus also had an observation by [[Archimedes]]. As shown in a 1991
[http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#nthq paper], in 158 BC Hipparchus computed a very erroneous summer solstice from [[Callippus]]'s calendar. He observed the summer solstice in 146 and 135&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} both [http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#htqp accurate] to a few hours, but observations of the moment of [[equinox]] were simpler, and he made twenty during his lifetime. Ptolemy gives an extensive discussion of Hipparchus's work on the length of the year in the ''Almagest'' III.1, and quotes many observations that Hipparchus made or used, spanning 162–128&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}. [http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#qxhr Analysis] of Hipparchus's seventeen equinox observations made at Rhodes shows that the mean error in declination is positive seven arc minutes, nearly agreeing with the sum of refraction by air and Swerdlow's parallax. The random noise is two arc minutes or more nearly one arcminute if rounding is taken into account which approximately agrees with the sharpness of the eye. Ptolemy quotes an equinox timing by Hipparchus (at 24 March 146&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} at dawn) that differs by 5 hours from the observation made on [[Alexandria]]'s large public [[equatorial ring]] that same day (at 1 hour before noon): Hipparchus may have visited Alexandria but he did not make his equinox observations there; presumably he was on Rhodes (at nearly the same geographical longitude). He could have used the equatorial ring of his armillary sphere or another equatorial ring for these observations, but Hipparchus (and Ptolemy) knew that observations with these instruments are sensitive to a precise alignment with the [[equator]], so if he were restricted to an armillary, it would make more sense to use its meridian ring as a transit instrument. The problem with an equatorial ring (if an observer is naive enough to trust it very near dawn or dusk) is that atmospheric [[refraction]] lifts the Sun significantly above the horizon: so for a northern hemisphere observer its apparent [[declination]] is too high, which changes the observed time when the Sun crosses the equator. (Worse, the refraction decreases as the Sun rises and increases as it sets, so it may appear to move in the wrong direction with respect to the equator in the course of the day – as Ptolemy mentions. Ptolemy and Hipparchus apparently did not realize that refraction is the cause.) However, such details have doubtful relation to the data of either man, since there is no textual, scientific, or statistical ground for believing that their equinoxes were taken on an equatorial ring, which is useless for solstices in any case. Not one of two centuries of mathematical investigations of their solar errors has claimed to have traced them to the effect of refraction on use of an equatorial ring. Ptolemy claims his solar observations were on a transit instrument set in the meridian.

Recent expert [http://springer.com/us/book/9789048127870 translation and analysis] by Anne Tihon of papyrus P. Fouad 267 A has confirmed the 1991 finding cited above that Hipparchus obtained a summer solstice in 158 BC But the papyrus makes the date June 26, over a day earlier than the 1991 paper's conclusion for June 28. The earlier [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w13.pdf study's] §M found that Hipparchus did not adopt June 26 solstices until 146 BC when he founded the orbit of the sun which Ptolemy later adopted. Dovetailing these data suggests Hipparchus extrapolated the 158 BC June 26 solstice from his 145 solstice 12 years later a procedure that would cause only minuscule error. The papyrus also confirmed that Hipparchus had used Callippic solar motion in 158 BC, a new finding in 1991 but not attested directly until P. Fouad 267 A. Another table on the papyrus is perhaps for sidereal motion and a third table is for Metonic tropical motion, using a previously unknown year of {{frac|365|1|4}} – {{frac|1|309}} days. This was presumably found&lt;ref&gt;Explained at equation 25 of a recent [http://www.dioi.org/vols/wk0.pdf investigation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206015239/http://dioi.org/vols/wk0.pdf |date=6 February 2015 }}, paper #2.&lt;/ref&gt; by dividing the 274 years from 432 to 158 BC, into the corresponding interval of 100077 days and {{frac|14|3|4}} hours between Meton's sunrise and Hipparchus's sunset solstices.

At the end of his career, Hipparchus wrote a book called ''Peri eniausíou megéthous'' ("On the Length of the Year") about his results. The established value for the [[tropical year]], introduced by [[Callippus]] in or before 330&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} was {{frac|365|1|4}} days.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Babylon to Voyager and Beyond: A History of Planetary Astronomy|first=David|last=Leverington|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780521808408|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Hpi202ybn8C&amp;pg=PA30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Speculating a Babylonian origin for the Callippic year is hard to defend, since Babylon did not observe solstices thus the only extant System B year length was based on Greek solstices (see below). Hipparchus's equinox observations gave varying results, but he himself points out (quoted in ''Almagest'' III.1(H195)) that the observation errors by himself and his predecessors may have been as large as {{frac|1|4}} day. He used old solstice observations, and determined a difference of about one day in about 300 years. So he set the length of the tropical year to {{frac|365|1|4}} − {{frac|1|300}} days (= 365.24666... days = 365&amp;nbsp;days 5&amp;nbsp;hours 55&amp;nbsp;min, which differs from the actual value (modern estimate, including earth spin acceleration) in his time of about 365.2425 days, an error of about 6&amp;nbsp;min per year, an hour per decade, 10 hours per century.

Between the solstice observation of Meton and his own, there were 297 years spanning 108,478 days. D. Rawlins noted that this implies a tropical year of 365.24579... days = 365&amp;nbsp;days;14,44,51 (sexagesimal; = 365&amp;nbsp;days + {{sfrac|14|60}} + {{sfrac|44|60{{sup|2}}}} + {{sfrac|51|60{{sup|3}}}}) and that this exact year length has been found on one of the few Babylonian clay tablets which explicitly specifies the System B month. This is an indication that Hipparchus's work was known to Chaldeans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dioi.org/vols/w11.pdf ''DIO''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229121446/http://www.dioi.org/vols/w11.pdf |date=29 February 2008 }}, volume 1, number 1, pages 49–66; A.Jones, 2001; Thurston, ''op. cit.'', page 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Another value for the year that is attributed to Hipparchus (by the astrologer [[Vettius Valens]] in the 1st century) is 365 + {{sfrac|1|4}} + {{sfrac|1|288}} days (= 365.25347... days = 365&amp;nbsp;days 6&amp;nbsp;hours 5&amp;nbsp;min), but this may be a corruption of another value attributed to a Babylonian source: 365 + {{sfrac|1|4}} + {{sfrac|1|144}} days (= 365.25694... days = 365&amp;nbsp;days 6&amp;nbsp;hours 10&amp;nbsp;min). It is not clear if this would be a value for the [[sidereal year]] (actual value at his time (modern estimate) about 365.2565 days), but the difference with Hipparchus's value for the tropical year is consistent with his rate of [[precession]] (see below).

===Orbit of the Sun===
Before Hipparchus, astronomers knew that the lengths of the [[season]]s are not equal. Hipparchus made observations of equinox and solstice, and according to Ptolemy (''Almagest'' III.4) determined that spring (from spring equinox to summer solstice) lasted 94½ days, and summer (from summer solstice to autumn equinox) {{frac|92|1|2}} days. This is inconsistent with a premise of the Sun moving around the Earth in a circle at uniform speed. Hipparchus's solution was to place the Earth not at the center of the Sun's motion, but at some distance from the center. This model described the apparent motion of the Sun fairly well. It is known today that the [[planet]]s, including the Earth, move in approximate [[ellipse]]s around the Sun, but this was not discovered until [[Johannes Kepler]] published his first two laws of planetary motion in 1609. The value for the [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] attributed to Hipparchus by Ptolemy is that the offset is {{frac|1|24}} of the radius of the orbit (which is a little too large), and the direction of the [[apogee]] would be at longitude 65.5° from the [[vernal equinox]]. Hipparchus may also have used other sets of observations, which would lead to different values. One of his two eclipse trios' solar longitudes are consistent with his having initially adopted inaccurate lengths for spring and summer of {{frac|95|3|4}} and {{frac|91|1|4}} days.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, ''op. cit.'', page 67, note 16. R. Newton proposed that Hipparchus made an error of a degree in one of the trios' eclipses. D.Rawlins's theory (Thurston ''op. cit.'') that Hipparchus analysed the two trios in pairs not threesomes provides a possible explanation for the one degree slip. It was a [http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#qtpt fudge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124070852/http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm |date=24 January 2018 }} necessitated by inadequacies of analysing by pairs instead of using the better method Ptolemy applies at ''[[Almagest]]'' Book 4 Parts 6 and 11.&lt;/ref&gt; His other triplet of solar positions is consistent with {{frac|94|1|4}} and {{frac|92|1|2}} days,&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'', note 14; Jones 2001&lt;/ref&gt; an improvement on the results ({{frac|94|1|2}} and {{frac|92|1|2}} days) attributed to Hipparchus by Ptolemy, which a few scholars still question the authorship of. Ptolemy made no change three centuries later, and expressed lengths for the autumn and winter seasons which were already implicit (as shown, e.g., by A. [[Aaboe]]).

Hipparchus also undertook to find the distances and sizes of the Sun and the Moon. He published his results in a work of two books called ''Perí megethōn kaí apostēmátōn'' ("On Sizes and Distances") by Pappus in his commentary on the ''Almagest'' V.11; [[Theon of Smyrna]] (2nd century) mentions the work with the addition "of the Sun and Moon".

Hipparchus measured the apparent diameters of the Sun and Moon with his ''[[diopter]]''. Like others before and after him, he found that the Moon's size varies as it moves on its (eccentric) orbit, but he found no perceptible variation in the apparent diameter of the Sun. He found that at the ''[[mean]]'' distance of the Moon, the Sun and Moon had the same apparent diameter; at that distance, the Moon's diameter fits 650 times into the circle, i.e., the mean apparent diameters are {{frac|360|650}} = 0°33'14".

Like others before and after him, he also noticed that the Moon has a noticeable [[Lunar parallax|parallax]], i.e., that it appears displaced from its calculated position (compared to the Sun or [[star]]s), and the difference is greater when closer to the horizon. He knew that this is because in the then-current models the Moon circles the center of the Earth, but the observer is at the surface—the Moon, Earth and observer form a triangle with a sharp angle that changes all the time. From the size of this parallax, the distance of the Moon as measured in Earth [[radius|radii]] can be determined. For the Sun however, there was no observable parallax (we now know that it is about 8.8", several times smaller than the resolution of the unaided eye).

In the first book, Hipparchus assumes that the parallax of the Sun is 0, as if it is at infinite distance. He then analyzed a solar eclipse, which Toomer (against the opinion of over a century of astronomers) presumes to be the eclipse of 14 March 190&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEcat5/SE-0199--0100.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425070114/http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEcat5/SE-0199--0100.html |archivedate=25 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}, #04310, Fred Espenak, NASA/GSFC&lt;/ref&gt; It was total in the region of the [[Hellespont]] (and in his birthplace, Nicaea); at the time Toomer proposes the Romans were preparing for war with [[Antiochus III]] in the area, and the eclipse is mentioned by [[Livy]] in his ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri]]'' VIII.2. It was also observed in Alexandria, where the Sun was reported to be obscured 4/5ths by the Moon. Alexandria and Nicaea are on the same meridian. Alexandria is at about 31° North, and the region of the Hellespont about 40° North. (It has been contended that authors like Strabo and Ptolemy had fairly decent values for these geographical positions, so Hipparchus must have known them too. However, Strabo's Hipparchus dependent latitudes for this region are at least 1° too high, and Ptolemy appears to copy them, placing Byzantium 2° high in latitude.) Hipparchus could draw a triangle formed by the two places and the Moon, and from simple geometry was able to establish a distance of the Moon, expressed in Earth radii. Because the eclipse occurred in the morning, the Moon was not in the [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]], and it has been proposed that as a consequence the distance found by Hipparchus was a lower limit. In any case, according to Pappus, Hipparchus found that the least distance is 71 (from this eclipse), and the greatest 81 Earth radii.

In the second book, Hipparchus starts from the opposite extreme assumption: he assigns a (minimum) distance to the Sun of 490 Earth radii. This would correspond to a parallax of 7', which is apparently the greatest parallax that Hipparchus thought would not be noticed (for comparison: the typical resolution of the human eye is about 2'; [[Tycho Brahe]] made naked eye observation with an accuracy down to 1'). In this case, the shadow of the Earth is a [[conical surface|cone]] rather than a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] as under the first assumption. Hipparchus observed (at lunar eclipses) that at the mean distance of the Moon, the diameter of the shadow cone is {{frac|2|1|2}} lunar diameters. That apparent diameter is, as he had observed, {{frac|360|650}} degrees. With these values and simple geometry, Hipparchus could determine the mean distance; because it was computed for a minimum distance of the Sun, it is the maximum mean distance possible for the Moon. With his value for the eccentricity of the orbit, he could compute the least and greatest distances of the Moon too. According to Pappus, he found a least distance of 62, a mean of {{frac|67|1|3}}, and consequently a greatest distance of {{frac|72|2|3}} Earth radii. With this method, as the parallax of the Sun decreases (i.e., its distance increases), the minimum limit for the mean distance is 59 Earth radii – exactly the mean distance that Ptolemy later derived.

Hipparchus thus had the problematic result that his minimum distance (from book 1) was greater than his maximum mean distance (from book 2). He was intellectually honest about this discrepancy, and probably realized that especially the first method is very sensitive to the accuracy of the observations and parameters. (In fact, modern calculations show that the size of the 189&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} solar eclipse at Alexandria must have been closer to {{frac|9|10}}ths and not the reported {{frac|4|5}}ths, a fraction more closely matched by the degree of totality at Alexandria of eclipses occurring in 310 and 129&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} which were also nearly total in the Hellespont and are thought by many to be more likely possibilities for the eclipse Hipparchus used for his computations.)

Ptolemy later measured the lunar parallax directly (''Almagest'' V.13), and used the second method of Hipparchus with lunar eclipses to compute the distance of the Sun (''Almagest'' V.15). He criticizes Hipparchus for making contradictory assumptions, and obtaining conflicting results (''Almagest'' V.11): but apparently he failed to understand Hipparchus's strategy to establish limits consistent with the observations, rather than a single value for the distance. His results were the best so far: the actual mean distance of the Moon is 60.3 Earth radii, within his limits from Hipparchus's second book.

[[Theon of Smyrna]] wrote that according to Hipparchus, the Sun is 1,880 times the size of the Earth, and the Earth twenty-seven times the size of the Moon; apparently this refers to [[volume]]s, not [[diameter]]s. From the geometry of book 2 it follows that the Sun is at 2,550 Earth radii, and the mean distance of the Moon is {{frac|60|1|2}} radii. Similarly, [[Cleomedes]] quotes Hipparchus for the sizes of the Sun and Earth as 1050:1; this leads to a mean lunar distance of 61 radii. Apparently Hipparchus later refined his computations, and derived accurate single values that he could use for predictions of solar eclipses.

See [Toomer 1974] for a more detailed discussion.

===Eclipses===
[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (''Naturalis Historia'' II.X) tells us that Hipparchus demonstrated that lunar eclipses can occur five months apart, and solar eclipses seven months (instead of the usual six months); and the Sun can be hidden twice in thirty days, but as seen by different nations. Ptolemy discussed this a century later at length in ''Almagest'' VI.6. The geometry, and the limits of the positions of Sun and Moon when a solar or lunar eclipse is possible, are explained in ''Almagest'' VI.5. Hipparchus apparently made similar calculations. The result that two solar eclipses can occur one month apart is important, because this can not be based on observations: one is visible on the northern and the other on the southern hemisphere – as Pliny indicates – and the latter was inaccessible to the Greek.

Prediction of a solar eclipse, i.e., exactly when and where it will be visible, requires a solid lunar theory and proper treatment of the lunar parallax. Hipparchus must have been the first to be able to do this. A rigorous treatment requires [[spherical trigonometry]], thus those who remain certain that Hipparchus lacked it must speculate that he may have made do with planar approximations. He may have discussed these things in ''Perí tēs katá plátos mēniaías tēs selēnēs kinēseōs'' ("On the monthly motion of the Moon in latitude"), a work mentioned in the ''[[Suda]]''.

Pliny also remarks that "he also discovered for what exact reason, although the shadow causing the eclipse must from sunrise onward be below the earth, it happened once in the past that the moon was eclipsed in the west while both luminaries were visible above the earth" (translation H. Rackham (1938), [[Loeb Classical Library]] 330 p.&amp;nbsp;207). Toomer (1980) argued that this must refer to the large total lunar eclipse of 26 November 139&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, when over a clean sea horizon as seen from Rhodes, the Moon was eclipsed in the northwest just after the Sun rose in the southeast. This would be the second eclipse of the 345-year interval that Hipparchus used to verify the traditional Babylonian periods: this puts a late date to the development of Hipparchus's lunar theory. We do not know what "exact reason" Hipparchus found for seeing the Moon eclipsed while apparently it was not in exact [[astronomical opposition|opposition]] to the Sun. Parallax lowers the altitude of the luminaries; refraction raises them, and from a high point of view the horizon is lowered.

==Astronomical instruments and astrometry==
Hipparchus and his predecessors used various instruments for astronomical calculations and observations, such as the [[gnomon]], the [[astrolabe]], and the [[armillary sphere]].

Hipparchus is credited with the invention or improvement of several astronomical instruments, which were used for a long time for naked-eye observations. According to [[Synesius]] of Ptolemais (4th century) he made the first ''astrolabion'': this may have been an [[armillary sphere]] (which Ptolemy however says he constructed, in ''Almagest'' V.1); or the predecessor of the planar instrument called astrolabe (also mentioned by [[Theon of Alexandria]]). With an astrolabe Hipparchus was the first to be able to measure the geographical [[latitude]] and [[time]] by observing fixed stars. Previously this was done at daytime by measuring the shadow cast by a gnomon, by recording the length of the longest day of the year or with the portable instrument known as a ''[[scaphe]]''.

[[Image:equatorial ring.png|thumb|right|200px| [[Equatorial ring]] of Hipparchus's time.]]

Ptolemy mentions (''Almagest'' V.14) that he used a similar instrument as Hipparchus, called ''[[dioptra]]'', to measure the apparent diameter of the Sun and Moon. [[Pappus of Alexandria]] described it (in his commentary on the ''Almagest'' of that chapter), as did [[Proclus]] (''Hypotyposis'' IV). It was a 4-foot rod with a scale, a sighting hole at one end, and a wedge that could be moved along the rod to exactly obscure the disk of Sun or Moon.

Hipparchus also observed solar [[equinox]]es, which may be done with an [[equatorial ring]]: its shadow falls on itself when the Sun is on the [[equator]] (i.e., in one of the equinoctial points on the [[ecliptic]]), but the shadow falls above or below the opposite side of the ring when the Sun is south or north of the equator. Ptolemy quotes (in ''Almagest'' III.1 (H195)) a description by Hipparchus of an equatorial ring in Alexandria; a little further he describes two such instruments present in Alexandria in his own time.

Hipparchus applied his knowledge of spherical angles to the problem of denoting locations on the Earth's surface. Before him a grid system had been used by [[Dicaearchus]] of [[Messina, Italy|Messana]], but Hipparchus was the first to apply mathematical rigor to the determination of the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of places on the Earth. Hipparchus wrote a critique in three books on the work of the geographer [[Eratosthenes]] of Cyrene (3rd century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}), called ''Pròs tèn 'Eratosthénous geografían'' ("Against the Geography of Eratosthenes"). It is known to us from [[Strabo]] of Amaseia, who in his turn criticised Hipparchus in his own ''Geografia''. Hipparchus apparently made many detailed corrections to the locations and distances mentioned by Eratosthenes. It seems he did not introduce many improvements in methods, but he did propose a means to determine the [[geographic coordinate system|geographical longitudes]] of different [[city|cities]] at [[lunar eclipse]]s (Strabo ''Geografia'' 1 January 2012). A lunar eclipse is visible simultaneously on half of the Earth, and the difference in longitude between places can be computed from the difference in local time when the eclipse is observed. His approach would give accurate results if it were correctly carried out but the limitations of timekeeping accuracy in his era made this method impractical.

==Star catalog==
[[File:Hipparchus by Raphael.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Hipparchus holding his celestial globe, in [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens]]'' (c. 1510)]]
Late in his career (possibly about 135&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}) Hipparchus compiled his star catalog, the original of which does not survive. He also constructed a celestial globe depicting the constellations, based on his observations. His interest in the [[fixed star]]s may have been inspired by the observation of a [[supernova]] (according to Pliny), or by his discovery of precession, according to Ptolemy, who says that Hipparchus could not reconcile his data with earlier observations made by [[Timocharis]] and [[Aristillus]]. For more information see [[Discovery of precession]]. In [[Raphael]]'s painting ''[[The School of Athens]]'', Hipparchus is depicted holding his celestial globe, as the representative figure for astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Previously, [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] in the 4th century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} had described the stars and constellations in two books called ''Phaenomena'' and ''Entropon''. [[Aratus]] wrote a poem called ''Phaenomena'' or ''Arateia'' based on Eudoxus's work. Hipparchus wrote a commentary on the ''Arateia'' – his only preserved work – which contains many stellar positions and times for rising, culmination, and setting of the constellations, and these are likely to have been based on his own measurements.

Hipparchus made his measurements with an [[armillary sphere]], and obtained the positions of at least 850 stars. It is disputed which coordinate system(s) he used. Ptolemy's catalog in the ''[[Almagest]]'', which is derived from Hipparchus's catalog, is given in [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic coordinates]]. However Delambre in his ''Histoire de l'Astronomie Ancienne'' (1817) concluded that Hipparchus knew and used the [[equatorial coordinate system]], a conclusion challenged by [[Otto Neugebauer]] in his ''A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy'' (1975). Hipparchus seems to have used a mix of [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic coordinates]] and [[equatorial coordinate system|equatorial coordinates]]: in his commentary on Eudoxos he provides stars' polar distance (equivalent to the [[declination]] in the equatorial system), right ascension (equatorial), longitude (ecliptical), polar longitude (hybrid), but not celestial latitude.

As with most of his work, Hipparchus's star catalog was adopted and perhaps expanded by Ptolemy. Delambre, in 1817, cast doubt on Ptolemy's work. It was disputed whether the star catalog in the ''Almagest'' is due to Hipparchus, but 1976–2002 statistical and spatial analyses (by [[Robert Russell Newton|R. R. Newton]], [[Dennis Rawlins]], Gerd Grasshoff,&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Grasshoff: The history of Ptolemy's star catalogue, Springer, New York, 1990, {{isbn|3-540-97181-5}} (Analyse des im "Almagest" überlieferten Sternenkatalogs)&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Pickering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dioi.org/vols/wc0.pdf |title=Keith Pickering |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=6 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605011421/http://www.dioi.org/vols/wc0.pdf |archivedate=5 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dennis Duke&lt;!--THIS GUY SHOULD HAVE AN ARTICLE!--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~dduke/model2.pdf "The Measurement Method of the Almagest Stars"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612231300/http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~dduke/model2.pdf |date=12 June 2010 }}, by [http://people.scs.fsu.edu/~dduke Dennis Duke] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607200920/http://people.scs.fsu.edu/~dduke/ |date=7 June 2007 }}, DIO: the International Journal of Scientific History,12 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;) have shown conclusively that the ''Almagest'' star catalog is almost entirely Hipparchan. Ptolemy has even (since Brahe, 1598) been accused by astronomers of fraud for stating (''Syntaxis'', book 7, chapter 4) that he observed all 1025 stars: for almost every star he used Hipparchus's data and precessed it to his own epoch {{fraction|2|2|3}} centuries later by adding 2°40' to the longitude, using an erroneously small precession constant of 1° per century.

In any case the work started by Hipparchus has had a lasting heritage, and was much later updated by [['Abd Al-Rahman Al Sufi|Al Sufi]] (964) and Copernicus (1543). [[Ulugh Beg]] reobserved all the Hipparchus stars he could see from Samarkand in 1437 to about the same accuracy as Hipparchus's. The catalog was superseded only in the late 16th century by Brahe and Wilhelm IV of Kassel via superior ruled instruments and spherical trigonometry, which improved accuracy by an order of magnitude even before the invention of the telescope. Hipparchus is considered the greatest observational astronomer from classical antiquity until Brahe.&lt;ref&gt;Benson Bobrick, ''The Fated Sky'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 2005, p 151&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stellar magnitude===
Hipparchus is only conjectured to have ranked the [[apparent magnitude]]s of stars on a numerical scale from 1, the brightest, to 6, the faintest.&lt;ref name=Ptolemy&gt;{{Citation |author=Ptolemy |author-link=Ptolemy |translator-last=Toomer |translator-first=G.

R. Pogson]] in 1856, who placed the magnitudes on a logarithmic scale, making magnitude 1 stars 100 times brighter than magnitude 6 stars, thus each magnitude is {{radic|100|5}} or 2.512 times brighter than the next faintest magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/MNRAS/0017//0000012.000.html |title=Magnitudes of Thirty-six of the Minor Planets for the first day of each month of the year 1857 |authorlink=Norman Robert Pogson |first=N.

==Precession of the equinoxes (146–127&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}})==
{{see also|Precession (astronomy)}}

Hipparchus is generally recognized as discoverer of the [[precession]] of the [[equinox]]es in 127&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Jones "Ptolemy in Perspective: Use and Criticism of his Work from Antiquity to the Nineteenth Century, Springer, 2010, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;  His two books on precession, ''On the Displacement of the Solsticial and Equinoctial Points'' and ''On the Length of the Year'', are both mentioned in the ''[[Almagest]]'' of Claudius [[Ptolemy]]. According to Ptolemy, Hipparchus measured the longitude of [[Spica]] and [[Regulus]] and other bright stars. Comparing his measurements with data from his predecessors, [[Timocharis]] and [[Aristillus]], he concluded that Spica had moved 2° relative to the [[autumnal equinox]]. He also compared the lengths of the [[tropical year]] (the time it takes the Sun to return to an equinox) and the [[sidereal year]] (the time it takes the Sun to return to a fixed star), and found a slight discrepancy. Hipparchus concluded that the equinoxes were moving ("precessing") through the zodiac, and that the rate of precession was not less than 1° in a century.

==Geography==
Hipparchus's treatise "Against the Geography of [[Eratosthenes]]" in three books is not preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Editions of fragments: Berger H. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1qNDAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=berger+hugo+hipparchus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4yHbGolIRN&amp;sig=gOAsU8DfieuAUEJKiHO4bW198nA&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=telmUKShJ66N4gSTo4GoAQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=berger%20hugo%20hipparchus&amp;f=false ''Die geographischen Fragmente des Hipparch''].

Most of our knowledge of it comes from [[Strabo]], according to whom Hipparchus thoroughly and often unfairly criticized [[Eratosthenes]] mainly for internal contradictions and inaccuracy in determining positions of geographical localities. Hipparchus insists that a geographic map must be based only on astronomical measurements of [[Latitude and longitude|latitudes and longitudes]] and [[triangulation]] for finding unknown distances. 
In geographic theory and methods Hipparchus introduced three main innovations.&lt;ref&gt;On Hipparchus's geography see: Berger H.

He was the first to use the [[Geographic coordinate system|grade grid]], to determine [[Latitude|geographic latitude]] from star observations, and not only from the sun’s altitude, a method known long before him, and to suggest that [[Longitude|geographic longitude]] could be determined by means of simultaneous observations of lunar eclipses in distant places. In the practical part of his work, the so-called "table of [[Clime|climata]]", Hipparchus listed latitudes for several tens of localities. In particular, he improved [[Eratosthenes]]' values for the latitudes of [[Athens]], [[Sicily]], and [[Comorin|southern extremity of India]].&lt;ref&gt;Shcheglov D.A.

In calculating latitudes of [[clime|climata]] (latitudes correlated with the length of the longest solstitial day), Hipparchus used an unexpectedly accurate value for [[Axial tilt|the obliquity of the ecliptic]], 23°40′ (the actual value in the second half of the 2nd century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} was approximately 23°43′), whereas all other ancient authors knew only a roughly rounded value 24°, and even [[Ptolemy]] used a less accurate value, 23°51′.&lt;ref&gt;Diller A. (1934). "Geographical Latitudes in Eratosthenes, Hipparchus and Posidonius". ''Klio'' 27.3: 258–269; cf. Shcheglov D.A.

Hipparchus opposed the view generally accepted in the [[Hellenistic period]] that the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean]]s and the [[Caspian Sea]] are parts of a single ocean. At the same time he extends the limits of the [[Ecumene|oikoumene]], i.e. the inhabited part of the land, up to the [[equator]] and the [[Arctic Circle]].&lt;ref&gt;Shcheglov D.A. [https://nw.academia.edu/DmitryShcheglov/Papers/141379/Ptolemys_Latitude_of_Thule_and_the_Map_Projection_in_the_Pre-Ptolemaic_Geography "Ptolemy’s Latitude of Thule and the Map Projection in the Pre-Ptolemaic Geography"]. ''Antike Naturwissenschaft und ihre Rezeption (AKAN)'' 17. 2007: 132-139.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hipparchus’ ideas found their reflection in the ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' of [[Ptolemy]]. In essence, Ptolemy's work is an extended attempt to realize Hipparchus’ vision of what geography ought to be.

==Legacy==
The rather cumbersome formal name for the [[European Space Agency|ESA]]'s [[Hipparcos|Hipparcos Space Astrometry Mission]] was High Precision Parallax Collecting Satellite; it was deliberately named in this way to give an acronym, HiPParCoS, that echoed and commemorated the name of Hipparchus. The lunar crater [[Hipparchus (lunar crater)|Hipparchus]] and the [[asteroid]] [[4000 Hipparchus]] are more directly named after him.

==Monument==
The Astronomer's Monument at the [[Griffith Observatory]] in Los Angeles, California, United States features a relief of Hipparchus as one of six of the greatest astronomers of all time and the only one from Antiquity.

[[File:Madame de Meuron.jpg|thumb|[[Elisabeth de Meuron|Madame de Meuron]] with ear trumpet]]
The first [[hearing aid]] was created in the 17th century. The movement toward modern hearing aids began with the creation of the [[telephone]], and the first electric hearing aid was created in 1898. By the late 20th century, the digital hearing aid was distributed to the public commercially. Some of the first hearing aids were external hearing aids. External hearing aids directed sounds in front of the ear and blocked all other noises. The apparatus would fit behind or in the ear.

The invention of the [[carbon microphone]], [[transmitters]], digital signal processing chip or [[Digital signal processor|DSP]], and the development of [[computer]] technology helped transform the hearing aid to its present form.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Howard, Alexander. "Hearing Aids: Smaller and Smarter." New York Times, November 26, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ear trumpets==
{{Main|Ear trumpet}}
[[File:King goa's chair.jpg|thumb|right|Frederick Rein's ingenious acoustic chair, designed for King [[John VI of Portugal]] in the early 19th-century.]]
The use of ear trumpets for the partially deaf, dates back to the 17th century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; By the late 18th century, their use was becoming increasingly common. Collapsible conical ear trumpets were made by instrument makers on a one-off basis for specific clients. Well known models of the period included the Townsend Trumpet (made by the [[deaf education|deaf educator]] John Townshend), the Reynolds Trumpet (specially built for painter [[Joshua Reynolds]]) and the Daubeney Trumpet.

The first firm to begin commercial production of the ear trumpet was established by Frederick C. Rein in London in 1800. As well as producing ear trumpets, Rein also sold  hearing fans, and [[speaking tube]]s. These instruments helped amplify sounds, while still being portable. However, these devices were generally bulky and had to be physically supported from below. Later, smaller, hand-held [[ear trumpet]]s and cones were used as hearing aids.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Levitt, H. "Digital hearing aids: wheelbarrows to ear inserts." ASHA Leader 12, no. 17 (December 26, 2007): 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Mills, Mara. "Hearing Aids and the History of Electronics Miniaturization." IEEE Annals of the History of Computing 33.2 (2011): 24-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rein hearing aid catalog.jpg|thumb|left|Frederick Rein Ltd.'s catalog, displaying evolving 19th century designs.]] 
Rein was commissioned to design a special acoustic chair for the ailing King of [[Portugal]], [[John VI of Portugal]] in 1819. The throne was designed with ornately carved arms that looked like the open mouths of lions. These holes acted as the receiving area for the acoustics, which were transmitted to the back of the throne via a speaking tube, and into the king's ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beckerexhibits.wustl.edu/did/19thcent/part2.htm|title=Concealed Hearing Devices of the 19th Century}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally in the late 1800s, the acoustic horn, which was a tube that had two ends, a cone that captured sound, and was eventually made to fit in the ear.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  

Toward the late 19th century, hidden hearing aids became increasingly popular. Rein pioneered many notable designs, including his 'acoustic headbands', where the hearing aid device was artfully concealed within the hair or headgear. Reins' ''Aurolese Phones'' were headbands, made in a variety of shapes, that incorporated sound collectors near the ear that would amplify the acoustics. Hearing aids were also hidden in couches, clothing, and accessories. This drive toward ever increasing invisibility was often more about hiding the individual's disability from the public than about helping the individual cope with his problem.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

==Electronic hearing aids==
[[File:Vacuum tube hearing aid use 1933.jpg|thumb|A 1933 ad for early vacuum tube hearing aids.]]
[[File:Museum of Medicine Berlin Germany Telephone hearing aids.jpg|thumb|These German hearing aids date from around 1920 to 1950. They include an attachment similar to a telephone receiver. Museum of Medicine, Berlin, Germany.]]
The first electronic hearing aids were constructed after the invention of the [[telephone]] and [[microphone]] in the 1870s and 1880s. The technology within the telephone increased how acoustic signal could be altered. Telephones were able to control the [[loudness]], [[frequency]], and distortion of sounds. These abilities were used in the creation of the hearing aid.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

The first electric hearing aid, called the Akouphone, was created by [[Miller Reese Hutchison]] in 1898. It used a carbon transmitter, so that the hearing aid could be portable. The [[carbon transmitter]] was used to amplify sound by taking a weak signal and using [[electric current]] to make it a strong signal.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; These electronic hearing aids could eventually be shrunk into purses and other accessories.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  

One of the first manufacturers of the electronically amplified hearing aid was the [[Siemens]] company in 1913. Their hearing aids were bulky and not easily portable. They were about the size of a "tall cigar box" and had a speaker that would fit in the ear.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The first [[vacuum-tube]] hearing aid was patented by a Naval [[engineer]] Earl Hanson in 1920. It was called the Vactuphone and used the telephone [[transmitter]] to turn speech into electrical signals. After the signal was converted, it would be amplified when it moved to the receiver. The hearing aid weighed seven pounds, which made it light enough to be carried.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; [[Marconi]] in England and [[Western Electric]] in the US began marketing vacuum tube hearing aids in 1923.

During the 1920s and 1930s, the vacuum tube hearing aid became more successful and began to decrease in size with better miniaturization techniques. The Acousticon's Model 56 was created in the mid-1920s and was one of the first portable hearing aid units, although it was quite heavy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  The first wearable hearing aid using vacuum tube technology went on sale in England in 1936, and a year later in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aKbApRUm4kkC|title=Audiologists' Desk Reference: Audiologic management, rehabilitation, and terminology|author=James Wilbur Hall|year=1998|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, hearing aids were becoming popular to the public.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; [[Multitone Electronics|Multitone of London]] patented the first hearing aid to use [[automatic gain control]]. The same company introduced a wearable version in 1948.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  

Military technological advances that occurred in [[World War II]] helped the development of hearing aids. One of the major advances that World War II enabled was the idea of miniaturization.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  This could be seen by Zenith's pocket-sized Miniature 75.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

==Transistor hearing aids== 
[[File:Hearing aid 1980s close up.jpg|thumb|200x200px|This early 1980s photo shows a hearing aid with a transistor that is worn over the chest with shoulder straps. It would sometimes have a problem with static interference, even if the wearer laughed or smiled.]]
The development of [[transistors]] in 1948 by [[Bell Laboratories]] led to major improvements to the hearing aid.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  The transistor was invented by [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Brattain]], and [[William Shockley]].  Transistors were created to replace vacuum tubes; they were small, required less battery power and had less [[distortion]] and heat than their predecessor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  These vacuum tubes were typically hot and fragile, so the transistor was the ideal replacement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;K., W. (1953, Apr 19). Transistors in need of improvement. New York Times (1923-Current File), pp. E9.&lt;/ref&gt;The 1952 [[Sonotone 1010]] used a transistor stage along with vacuum tubes, to extend battery life.   The size of these transistors led to developments in miniature, carbon microphones. These microphones could be mounted on various items, even eyeglasses.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  In 1951, [[Raytheon]] manufactured the transistor and was one of the first companies to mass-produce transistors to throughout America. Raytheon realized that their hearing aid only lasted short-term and began to sell the vacuum-tube hearing aids again along with transistor hearing aids.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

The act of putting transistors into hearing aids was so quick that they were not properly tested. It was later found that transistors could get damp. Because of this dampness, the hearing aid would only last for a few weeks and then die. In order to stop this from happening, a coating had to be put on the transistor to protect it from the dampness. This problem had to be fixed in order for transistors in hearing aids to be successful.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;   

Zenith was the first company to realize the problem with transistors was the body heat of individuals. After coming to this conclusion, the first “all-transistor” hearing aids were offered in 1952, called the Microtone Transimatic and the Maico Transist-ear. In 1954, the company, [[Texas Instruments]], produced a [[silicon]] transistor, which was much more effective than the previous version.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  The end of the transistor was marked by the creation of the [[integrated circuit]] or IC by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments in 1958 and the technique was perfected in hearing aids over the next 20 years.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Elmer V. Carlson, the author of thirty patents, was instrumental in inventing many of the components of the modern hearing aid.&lt;ref&gt; http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-01-25/news/0301250251_1_hearing-aids-mr-carlson-elmer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymotic.com/media/publications/erl-0114-1992.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital hearing aid== 
Beginning in the early 1960s, Bell Telephone Laboratories created a process for creating both speech and audio signals on a large [[mainframe computer]]. Because of the size of digital computers, the process of simulating hearing aids was extremely slow. The progression of the audio speech signal took longer than the length of the duration of the signal itself. In order to get the power needed to process the sound, a large mainframe computer was needed. This made it nearly impossible to conceive the idea that hearing aids could be made into something that could be made to fit onto an ear. This research was important for learning about how to develop sounds for those with hearing disabilities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;     

In addition, in the 1970s, the [[microprocessor]] was created. This microprocessor helped to open up the door to miniaturization of the hearing aid.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Moreover, researcher [[Edgar Villchur]] developed multi-channel [[amplitude compression]]. Amplitude compression enabled [[audio signal]] to be separated into [[frequency band]]s. These bands were able to adjust sounds so that sounds that were more intensive were weakened and sounds that were weakened would become more intensified. The system of multi-channel amplitude compression would be later used as the fundamental structural design for the first hearing aids that used [[digital technology]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
  
[[File:Traditional hearing aids.jpg|thumb|Some hearing aids from the early 21st century with traditional designs.]]
Another pioneer in hearing aid development was Daniel Graupe, who developed the six-channel hearing aid. The six-channel hearing aid in 1975 had digital control of the frequency in all channels. In 1979, electro-acoustic features of hearing aids were able to be changed by a simple button. The pressing of this button caused the amplification to be altered to appropriate levels for the environment in which the individual was present.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; This technique of controlling the hearing aid for the environment is used in some manner throughout all digital hearing aids.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The creation of high-speed digital-array [[processors]] used in [[minicomputers]] opened up the door for advances in digital hearing aids.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  These minicomputers were able to process audio signals at speeds that were equivalent to real-time. In 1982, at the [[City University of New York]], the first real-time all digital hearing aid was created. The equipment contained a digital array processor and minicomputer. This consisted of an FM [[radio transmitter]] and receiver. The radio made a connection between the individual through a transmitter on the body to the radio on top of the computer. The transmitter on the body was connected by a wire to the ear microphone and the receiver.  Even though this was a major breakthrough in the creation of hearing aids, there were still a few problems. One of these major problems was that while the hearing aid worked, it was extremely heavy and nearly impossible to move.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
[[File:Oticon Bluetooth hearing aids.jpg|thumb|left|Oticon hearing aids to be used with [[Bluetooth]] wireless devices.]]

The first commercial digital hearing aid was created in 1987 by the Nicolet Corporation. The hearing aid contained a body-worn processor that had a hardwire connection with an ear mounted transducer. While the Nicolet Corporation’s hearing aid was not publicly successful and the company shortly folded, it was able to start a competition between companies to create more effective hearing aids. Two years later, in 1989, the behind-the-ear (BTE) digital hearing aid was launched.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In addition to the Nicolet Corporation, Bell Laboratories expanded upon the hearing aid business by developing a hybrid digital-analog hearing aid. This hearing aid used digital circuits to handle a two-channel compression amplifier. Even though early research on this hearing aid was successful, [[AT&amp;T]], the parent company to Bell Laboratories, pulled out of the hearing aid market and sold its rights to Resound Corporation in 1987. When the hearing aid was put on in the market, it was instantaneously successful. This development helped bring major changes to the world of the hearing aid.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

After the success of the Resound Corporation, other hearing aid companies began putting out hybrid hearing aids that included analog amplifiers, filters, and limiters that were managed digitally. There were many benefits to these hearing aids; which included storing parameter settings, having a capability for paired-comparison testing, having settings for different acoustic environments, and having more advanced methods of signaling; this which included multi-channel compression.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The next major milestone was creating an all-digital hearing aid. The Oticon Company developed the first digital hearing aid in 1995, but it was only distributed to audiological research centers for research on digital technology in the realm of acoustic amplification. The Senso was the first commercially successful, all-digital hearing aid, and was created by Widex in 1996.  After the success of the Senso, Oticon began marketing their own hearing aid, the DigiFocus.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Current digital hearing aids are now programmable which enables digital hearing aids to regulate the sound on their own, without using a separate control. The hearing aid can now adjust itself depending on what environment it is in and often does not even need a physical volume control button.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Kenneth. "Hearing Aid Museum ." Kent State University Excellence in Action. http://www.kent.edu/ehhs/spa/museum/history.cfm (accessed May 15, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently,  "Made for iPhone hearing aids" (MFi) were introduced by Resound, which enables users of MFi digital hearing aids to stream phone calls, music, and podcasts directly from iOS devices. &lt;ref&gt;Apple, Inc. "Made for iPhone Hearing Aids" https://www.apple.com/accessibility/ios/hearing-aids/ (accessed January 28, 2016). &lt;/ref&gt; 

Directly leveraging the audio processing power potential in smartphones, Jacoti BVBA from Belgium developed ListenApp, the first digital hearing aid application to win CE certification and FDA approval as a medical device. &lt;ref&gt;Jacoti, BVBA, "Jacoti ListenApp" https://www.jacoti.com/listenapp/ (accessed January 28, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hearing aid chips==
One of the first digital chips was created by Daniel Graupe.  The digital chip, referred to as the Zeta Noise Blocker, routinely adjusted the gain in the frequency channels to help control high levels of noise.  The chip was integrated in a number of hearing aids in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  In addition to the Zeta Noise Blocker, there was a development of digital chips that were devoted to high-speed [[digital signal processing]] or DSP. DSP chips became available in 1982, and began to be implemented into hearing aids. By 1988, chips were produced in hearing aids. One of the major contributions of these chips was the ability to process both speech and other types of noises in real time. One major down fall of these chips was that they were massive and used up a lot of battery, which made them nearly impossible to be worn.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

'''Iota Sigma Pi''' ('''ΙΣΠ''') is a national [[honor society]] in the United States. It was established in 1902 and specializes in the promotion of women in the sciences, especially [[chemistry]]. It also focuses on personal and professional growth for women in these fields.&lt;ref name=Jeannette&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Jeannette|title=American Women Chemists|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=5 January 2012|page=171|isbn=9780199742882}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with all honor societies, they create professional networks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ispmembersatlarge.com/|title=Who we are|date=4 December 2014|publisher=Iota Sigma Pi Members-at-large|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with recognizing achievements of women in chemistry.&lt;ref name="Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iotasigmapi.info/awards/professionalawards.html|title=Professional awards|publisher=Iota Stigma Pi: National Honor Society for Women in Chemistry|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The society was formed during a period when women gained little recognition for their work. Therefore, women began to set up their own awards to highlight their abilities on their [[resumes]].&lt;ref name=jill/&gt;

The national society was formed in 1902&lt;ref name=Jeannette/&gt; by Agnes Faye Morgan.&lt;ref name="A-Z"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science: Pioneering lives from Ancient Times to the Mid-20th Century|editor1=Ogilvie, Marilyn |editor2=Harvey, Joy |publisher=Routledge|date=2000|volume=2|page=913|chapter=Entries L&amp;ndash;Z|isbn=9780415920407}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was appointed department [[chairwoman|chair]] of the Department of Household Science and Arts at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] and was one of the first to integrate chemistry into the curriculum of home economics.&lt;ref name="A-Z"/&gt; She continued to participate in the society throughout her professional life and had a particular focus on research.&lt;ref name="Maresi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nerad|first=Maresi|title=The Academic Kitchen: A Social History of Gender Stratification at the University of California, Berkeley|publisher=SUNY Press|date=1999|page=79|isbn=9780791439708}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also founded a local honour society for women in home economics named Alpha Nu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sicherman|first=Barbara|author2=Hurd Green, Carol|title=Notable American Women: The Modern Period : a Biographical Dictionary|publisher=Harvard University Press|date=1980|page=497|isbn=9780674627338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society goals were to encourage women to pursue chemistry academically, to "stimulate personal accomplishment in chemical fields" and to promote the academic, business and social lives of its members.&lt;ref name="Maresi"/&gt;

Early chapters opened at the [[University of Washington]] around 1910 and continued to spread across the country, and eventually held meetings for the [[American Chemical Society]].&lt;ref name=jill&gt;{{cite book|last=Bystydzienski|first=Jill, M.|author2=R.Bird, Sharon |title=Removing Barriers: Women in Academic Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|publisher=Indiana University Press|date=2006|page=29|isbn=9780253111739}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, there was an offer of amalgamation &lt;!-- correct? --&gt; from the [[Phi Lambda Upsilon]] honor society for male chemists but this was refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rossiter|first=Margaret, W.|title=Women Scientists in America: Struggles and Strategies to 1940|publisher=JHU Press|date=1982|page=300|isbn=9780801825095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional awards ==

The highest award from the society is the National Honorary Member which is given to female chemists who have made an exceptional and significant achievement in the field. The certificate is awarded with a prize fund of USD1500. Some of the previous winners include: [[Marie Sklodowska-Curie]], [[Gerti Cori]] and [[Dorothy Hodgkin]].&lt;ref name="Awards"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemical Heritage|publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation|date=2001|volume=19–21|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Violet Diller Professional Excellence Award, named after a previous member (treasurer and president), is awarded for "accomplishments in academic, governmental, or industrial chemistry, in education, in administration, or in a combination of these areas". The award consists of a certificate and USD1000 prize fund.&lt;ref name="Awards"/&gt; This award was first awarded to Joan P. Lambros in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iotasigmapi.info/awards/professionalawards.html|title=Awards for Professionals|website=www.iotasigmapi.info|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Agnes Fay Morgan Research Award]] is given to women who have achieved in the field of chemistry or biochemistry.&lt;ref name="Awards"/&gt;

The Centennial Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching is given to those who have excelled in teaching chemistry, biochemistry or a similar subject. The nominee must spend at least 75% of their time teaching undergraduates to qualify for the certificate and USD500 award.&lt;ref name="Awards"/&gt;

== Student awards ==

The Anna Louise Hoffman Award for Outstanding Achievement in Graduate Research is given to the nominee that has demonstrated outstanding chemical research. The nominee must also be a full-time graduate student to get the certification and US$500 reward.&lt;ref name="Studentawards"/&gt;

There are two awards for Undergraduate Excellence in Chemistry; one must go to a first-generation student. Again, the reward is a certificate and US$500.&lt;ref name="Studentawards"/&gt;

The [[Gladys Anderson Emerson]] Undergraduate Scholarship is funded from Emerson's estate. She wished for the funding to be given to female Iota Sigma Pi members who are undergraduates in chemistry or biochemistry. The scholarship consists of a US$2000 [[stipend]] and a certificate.&lt;ref name="Studentawards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iotasigmapi.info/awards/studentawards.html#alh|title=Student Awards|publisher=Iota Stigma Pi: National Honor Society for Women in Chemistry|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Members-at-Large Re-entry Award is for those who have been away from academic study for over three years and then returned to degree-level chemistry. This is awarded with a US$1500 cash prize and a certificate of recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ispmembersatlarge.com/members-at-large-re-entry-award.html|title=The MAL Reentry Award|date=4 December 2014|publisher=Iota Stigma Pi Members-at-large|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aimed at high school students, the Outstanding Young Women in Chemistry is an award given to those who demonstrate high academic ability in chemistry.&lt;ref name="Studentawards"/&gt;

'''James "Scotty" Paton''' (1869&amp;ndash;1917 or 18) was a Scots-born seaman who sailed to the [[Antarctic]] in several major expeditions between 1902 and 1917. His first venture was from 1902 to 1904 as a crewman of  [[William Colbeck (seaman)|''Captain William Colbeck'']]'s [[SY Morning]]. This expedition consisted of two voyages and  was sent as a relief ship for the  [[Captain Scott]]'s [[Discovery Expedition]]. During the first voyage the ship was briefly stalled in the ice between [[Cape Bird]] and  [[Beaufort Island]]. Scotty Paton took the opportunity to leave ship and jump floes a distance of one mile to 'land' of Beaufort Island, the first man to do so. This accomplishment was received with a reprimand.&lt;ref&gt;Rosove 2002, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907&amp;ndash;09  he  was a crew member of [[Sir Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Nimrod Expedition]] during each of ''Nimrod's'' two southern voyages. From 1910 to 1913 he was a seaman aboard Captain Scott's ''Terra Nova'' during her two voyages between [[New Zealand]] and [[Cape Evans]], in support of Scott's ill-fated expedition. In 1914 he joined the [[Ross Sea party]] section of Shackleton's [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] as [[boatswain]] on the [[SY Aurora|''Aurora'']]. He was aboard ship on 7 May 1915 when ''Aurora'' was torn from her Cape Evans moorings, drifting in the pack for nine months before limping back to New Zealand. Paton's last Antarctic voyage was with ''Aurora'' on the mission to relieve the stranded Ross Sea party in January 1917.

After ''Aurora'''s return to New Zealand she was sold, and became a coal carrier.  Paton signed on as her boatswain, and was aboard when she left Newcastle, [[New South Wales]] in June 1917, bound for South America. Her fate is uncertain, but in late 1917 or early 1918 she was lost, and Paton was lost with her. An inquiry established that the German raider ''Wolf'' was laying mines in [[Cook Strait]] and in the [[Tasmanian Sea]] in June and July 1917 and concluded that the ''Aurora'' likely ran afoul a mine.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler-Lewis,2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Paton's Antarctic voyages are commemorated by Paton Peak, {{convert|2531|ft|m}}, on [[Beaufort Island]] in the [[Ross Sea]],  [[Antarctica]], at {{coord|76|56|S|166|56|E}}.

'''Kleinjena''' is situated 4 kilometres north of Naumburg on a long spur at the foot of the Finne mountain range above the village of Kleinjena, at the heart of [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in the State of [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. It has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage]]. The World Heritage nomination is representative for the processes that shaped the continent during the [[High Middle Ages]] between 1000 and 1300: [[Christianization]], the so-called “[[Landesausbau]]”  and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2017): WHC/17/41.COM/INF.8B1.{{cite book|title=Nominations to the World Heritage List (Krakow, 2017).|publisher= UNESCO press|page=54|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Robert|title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950-1350|date=1994|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lanscape around Neuenburg.jpg|thumb|Landscape around Neuenburg]]

== World Heritage Nomination ==
The castle of Kleinjena is one of the eleven components of the cultural landscape [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]]. As Kleinjena marks the starting point for the vast growth of the region in the [[12th century]], it is indispensable for an understanding of the history of this [[cultural landscape]] as a whole.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Förderverein Welterbe an Saale und Unstrut e.V. is the coordinating body for this nomination: http://www.naumburg-cathedral.de/.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The castle of Kleinjena was built by the influential [[Ekkehard]]ine dynasty. This dynasty owned estates in the old settlement area in the northern part of [[Thuringia]] and in the area of the conﬂuence of the rivers [[Saale]] and [[Unstrut]]. The family seat was the castle of Gene, which was situated south of the Unstrut River in the former diocese of the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Ekkehardiner, Markgrafen von Meißen und ihre Beziehungen zum Reich und zu den Piasten (= Europäische Hochschulschriften. Reihe 3: Geschichte und ihre Hilfswissenschaften. Bd. 691).|trans-title=The Ekkerhardines, margraves of Meißen and their relations in the empire (European university publications. Number 3: History and related sciences. Bd. 691.|author=Rupp, Gabriele|publisher=Lang|date=1996|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other [[Ottonian]] [[palace]]s or imperial [[castles]] of the time, the castle complex of Ekkehard I was a segmented complex with two ramparts on a ﬂat spur. Its main rampart and the related trench have ﬂattened to a great extent, but they are still clearly visible in the terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mitteldeutsche Geschichte. Sachsen - Sachsen-Anhalt - Thüringen.|trans-title=Central German history. Saxony - Saxony-Anhalt-Thuringia|author=Raßloff, Steffen|publisher=Edition Leipzig|date=2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the murder of [[Ekkehard I]], the site was gradually abandoned as the margravial brothers Hermann and Ekkehard II transferred their family seatfrom Kleinjena to Naumburg (Nuenburch), first mentioned in the records in 1012.

It was also presented at the Indian National Congress meeting in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roy|2006|pp=498–499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, many other proposals were initiated, but none of them gained attention from the nationalist movement.|group="Note"}} ||

A crescent and a star, both in white, are set in top fly. Seven white stars are arranged as in the [[Saptarishi]] constellation (the constellation [[Ursa Major]]), which is sacred to [[Hindu]]s. {{#tag:ref|In 1916, Suraiya Tayyabji submitted thirty new designs, in the form of a booklet funded by members of the High Court of Madras. These many proposals and recommendations did little more than keep the flag movement alive. The same year, Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak adopted a new flag as part of the Home Rule Movement. The flag included the Union Jack in the upper left corner, a star and crescent in the upper right, and seven stars displayed diagonally from the lower right, on a background of five red and four green alternating bands. The flag resulted in the first governmental initiative against any nationalistic flag, as a magistrate in Coimbatore banned its use. The ban was followed by a public debate on the function and importance of a national flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Virmani|1999|pp=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}}

This is a '''list of craters on Mars'''. [[Impact crater]]s on [[Mars]] larger than 1&amp;nbsp;km exist by the hundreds of thousands, but only about one thousand of them have names.&lt;ref name="Gazetteer-Mars-Craterlist" /&gt; Names are assigned by the [[International Astronomical Union]] after petitioning by relevant scientists, and in general, only craters that have a significant research interest are given names. Martian craters are named after famous scientists and [[science fiction]] authors, or if less than 60&amp;nbsp;km in diameter, after towns on [[Earth]]. Craters cannot be named for living people, and names for small craters are rarely intended to commemorate a specific town.&lt;ref name="Gazetteer-Categories" /&gt; Latitude and longitude are given as planetographic coordinates with west longitude.

== Catalog of named craters ==

The catalog is divided into three partial lists:
* [[List of craters on Mars: A–G]]
* [[List of craters on Mars: H–N]]
* [[List of craters on Mars: O–Z]]

Names are grouped into tables for each letter of the alphabet, containing the crater's name (linked if article exists), coordinates, diameter in kilometers, year of official name adoption (approval), the [[eponym]] ("named after") and a direct reference to the ''Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature''.&lt;ref name="Gazetteer-Mars-Craterlist" /&gt;

== Statistics ==

As of 2017, Martian craters account for 21% of all 5,211 named craters in the [[Solar System]]. Apart from the [[Moon]], no other body has as many named craters as Mars. Other, non-planetary bodies with numerous named craters include [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] ([[List of craters on Callisto|141]]), [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] ([[List of craters on Ganymede|131]]), [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]] (128), [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] (90), [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] (90), [[Dione (moon)|Dione]] (73), [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]] (58), [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] (53), [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]] (50) and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] ([[List of craters on Europa|41]]). For a full list, ''see [[List of craters in the Solar System]]''.

=== Largest craters ===

Some of the largest craters on Mars remain unnamed. Diameters differ depending on source data.

The [[iPad]] is an [[iOS]]-based line of [[tablet computer]]s designed and developed by [[Apple Inc.]]; it has a wide variety of accessories made by Apple available for it, including a screen cover specifically for the respective models of iPad called '''Smart Cover''', as well as a number of accessories to allow the iPad to connect to other devices, some of which enable non-[[touchscreen]] input.

| '''Smart Cover''' || [[File:IPad 4 Smart Cover.jpg|200px|center]] || A cover that attaches magnetically to the side of the device and covers the front. The Smart Cover has three folds, dividing the case into four portions, so it can be maneuvered to create a stand for the tablet. This can be either used to prop the iPad up in a position suitable for typing, or in an upright position for watching video and video calling over [[FaceTime]]. To expose the rear-facing HD video camera on the iPad, the cover can also be folded in half.  The cover aligns with the front screen of the iPad and is designed to add very little thickness to the overall profile of the device. Additionally, when the Smart Cover is lifted off the face of the iPad, it automatically turns the device on from standby, meaning the on/off button on the top right of the device does not need to be pressed when the user wishes to use it. A smaller Smart Cover, featuring 3 folds and an integrated hinge, was released alongside the iPad mini. || [[iPad 2]] &lt;br /&gt;[[IPad (3rd generation)]]

|'''Smart Keyboard'''
|
|The Smart Keyboard is a standalone hardware keyboard designed for the iPad Pro. It's essentially a MacBook keyboard build into a Smart Cover, allowing it to serve as both a cover for the display, a stand, and a physical keyboard. With keys covered in woven fabric, the Smart Keyboard is resistant to water and other liquids. Measuring in at 4mm, the Smart Keyboard does not include wires or standard keyboard components so it does not need to be charged. Instead, it is powered by the Smart Connector, a new port that's found on the iPad Pro.

|'''Apple Digital AV Adapter'''|| rowspan="2" |[[File:Apple Composite AV Cable.jpg|200px|center]]|| Released with iPad 2 and mirrors video output. This adapter allows the user to mirror anything on the iPad's (iPad 2 or later) screen to a [[High-definition television|HDTV]] or any other [[HDMI]]-compatible display, in up to [[1080p]], so that whatever the iPad's user does is viewable to the audience watching on the larger HDMI-compatible display. The Apple Digital AV Adapter connects to the iPad 2 or later or iPad 2 Dock via the [[Dock Connector|30-pin dock connector]], whilst the other end has two connections; one is a 30-pin dock connector to charge/power the device whilst being used, the other is a HDMI-out for connecting to any HDMI-compatible display using an [[HDMI cable]]. || rowspan="5" |[[IPad (1st generation)]]

|-
| '''Apple Composite AV Cable''' || Allows the iPad or iPad 2 to be connected to any TV or home cinema system to allow Movies and other videos to be watched in stereo sound only on a TV from the iPad or iPad 2. This is achieved by plugging the wires into the composite video and audio plugs in a TV or home cinema system and into the 30-pin connector on the iPad or iPad 2. However, it will not mirror the display. ||&lt;ref name="apple.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/ipad/accessories/|title=Buy iPad Accessories - Cases, Keyboards, Music &amp; more - Apple|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| '''iPad VGA Adapter''' ||[[File:IPad VGA Adapter.jpg|200px|center]] || Works in exactly the same way as the composite AV cable but connects to the component inputs of a TV rather than the composite input. || &lt;ref name="apple.com"/&gt;
|-
| '''iPad Camera Connection Kit''' || [[File:Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit.png|200px|center]] || A kit of 2 adapters, one [[USB]] and one for [[SD Card]]s. They copy the images from an external camera and import them to the iPad. This accessory is compatible with all generations of the iPad and will allow photos and videos to be transferred from an iPhone but not vice versa. Camera Connection kit can also be used to attach USB [[Sound card#USB sound cards|audio card]] or [[MIDI keyboard]], even general keyboards for typing. ||&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4101 | title=iPad: Using the iPad Camera Connection Kit | accessdate=November 27, 2011 | publisher=Apple}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| '''iPad Dock''' || [[File:IPad 2 Dock.jpg|200px|center]] || Almost the same as the [[IPad#Optional accessories|original iPad]] dock, however it is moulded specially for the design changes of the iPad 2, such as making the iPad thinner. It also includes a "Line Out" port in the back for speakers. This dock also works with the 3rd Generation iPad with the 0.6mm difference in thickness (the 3rd Generation being thicker) still allowing the 3rd Generation iPad to fit into the iPad 2 moulding. The dock was styled the iPad 2 Dock when the iPad 2 was the latest iPad available, however when the New iPad was released it was renamed 'iPad Dock'. The iPad Dock is not compatible with the fourth generation iPad, which uses the Lightning connector. There are two versions of the iPad Dock; One without the keyboard and one with the keyboard.|| &lt;ref name="iPad Dock"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.apple.com/ipad/accessories/ | title=iPad Dock | accessdate=March 16, 2012 | author=Apple Inc. | date=March 7, 2012 | publisher=Apple.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5614">'''Moderation theory''' is a set of interrelated hypotheses that explain the process through which political groups eschew radical platforms in favour of more moderate policies and prefer electoral, compromising and non-confrontational strategies over non-electoral, exclusive, and confrontational strategies. Moderation can take place at both ideological and behavioural levels that mutually reinforce each other.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The origins of the theory go back to the work of [[Robert Michels]] who offers a classical study of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] in his book ''[[Political Parties]]''.{{sfn|Alidina|2014|p=1}} The theory offers insights into the transformation of party politics in a great range of cultural and historical cases including socialist{{sfn|Przeworski|Sprague|1986}} and [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties{{sfn|Kalyvas|1996}} in Western Europe and more recently Islamic political groups.{{sfn|Tezcür|2010}} In particular, the evolution of Islamic [[political parties]] in Turkey since the early 1970s that culminated in the rise of the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] in the 2002 parliamentary elections exemplifies the dynamics highlighted by moderation theory.

The theory is composed of three causal mechanisms.{{sfn|Tezcür|2010|pp=27–32}} First, once radical political groups are organized as vote-seeking parties, electoral considerations prevail and these groups abandon revolutionary agendas in favour of vote-maximizing strategies. This expectation is based on the [[median voter theorem]]. A second mechanism concerns the vulnerability of radical political groups participating in electoral contest to state repression. The logic of political survival necessitates that these groups avoid openly confronting state elites. The final mechanism involves the effects of organizational resources on group behaviour and suggests that the maintenance of electoral organization is prioritized over original political goals. Once radicals are organized as electoral parties, their original projects of revolutionizing the 
political system becomes unachievable simply because of the lack of organizational resources. While moderation of radicals is generally thought to be conducive to [[democratization]], it can also hamper and even hinder democratic progress as radicals are co-opted into the ruling political system and lose their reformist characteristics.

In contemporary times, moderation theory is further developed and critically refined to understand the evolution of Islamic political parties in Muslim majority countries as diverse as Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, and [[Güneş Murat Tezcür|Turkey]]. The [[Al-Wasat Party|Center Party]] (''Hizb al-Wasat'') of Egypt is example of a moderate Islamic organization that was not given license by the ruling regime.{{sfn|Wickham|2004}} Moreover, [[Muslim Brotherhood]] of Egypt has transformed into an organization that is responsive to the logic of political competition and survival in an authoritarian regime at the cost of its original ideological commitments.{{sfn|El-Ghobashy|2005}} Similarly, the [[Islamic Action Front]] of Jordan shows that Islamists can be moderate as a result of participation in pluralistic political process as long as this participation can be justified in Islamic terms.{{sfn|Schwedler|2006}}

The '''National Botanical Research Institute''' ('''NBRI''') is a research institute of [[CSIR India|CSIR]] in [[Lucknow]]. It is engaged in the field of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and modern [[biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.nbri-lko.org/ | title=NBRI Webpage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally conceptualised and set up as the National Botanic Gardens (NBG) by Professor [[Kailas Nath Kaul]] on behalf of the State Government of [[Uttar Pradesh]], it was taken over by the CSIR in 1953. Dr [[Triloki Nath Khoshoo]] joined in 1964 as the Assistant Director, shortly afterwards becoming the Director. Initially engaged in research work in the classical botanical disciplines, the NBG went on laying an increasing emphasis in keeping with the national needs and priorities in the field of plant sciences, on its applied and developmental research activities. Due to the untiring efforts of Dr [[Triloki Nath Khoshoo|Khoshoo]], the institute rose to the stature of being the National Botanical Research Institute in 1978, reflecting the correct nature and extent of its aims and objectives, functions and R &amp; D activities. [[Sikandar Bagh]] is a famous and historic pleasure garden, located in the grounds of the Institute.

==Achievements==
* NBRI developed a new variety of [[bougainvillea]], named Los Banos Variegata-Jayanthi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?sectionName=&amp;id=92149910-6ba1-4841-ae84-8bd718b72699&amp;&amp;Headline=Scientists+develop+new+variety+of+bougainvillea&amp;strParent=strParentID | title = Scientists develop new variety of bougainvillea | accessdate = 2008-08-11 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080916151019/http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?sectionName=&amp;id=92149910-6ba1-4841-ae84-8bd718b72699&amp;&amp;Headline=Scientists+develop+new+variety+of+bougainvillea&amp;strParent=strParentID | archivedate = 2008-09-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2816">The '''Ozsváth–Schücking metric''', or the '''Ozsváth–Schücking solution''', is a [[vacuum solution (general relativity)|vacuum solution]] of the [[Einstein field equations]].  The metric was published by István Ozsváth and [[Engelbert Schücking]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=I.|last1=Ozsváth|first2=E.|last2=Schücking|title=An anti-Mach metric|journal=Recent Developments in General Relativity|pages=339–350|year=1962|url=http://web.mit.edu/jwk/www/docs/Ozsvath-Schucking%201962%20-%20Anti-Mach%20Metric.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is noteworthy among vacuum solutions for being the first known solution that is [[stationary spacetime|stationary]], globally defined, and singularity-free but nevertheless not isometric to the [[Minkowski metric]].  This stands in contradiction to a claimed strong Mach principle, which would forbid a vacuum solution from being anything but Minkowski without singularities, where the singularities are to be construed as mass as in the [[Schwarzschild metric]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=F. A. E.|last1=Pirani|title=Invariant Formulation of Gravitational Radiation Theory|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=105|pages=1089–1099|year=1957|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.105.1089|bibcode = 1957PhRv..105.1089P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With coordinates &lt;math&gt;\{x^0,x^1,x^2,x^3\}&lt;/math&gt;, define the following [[tetrad (general relativity)|tetrad]]:

:&lt;math&gt;e_{(0)}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2+(x^3)^2}}\left( x^3\partial_0-\partial_1+\partial_2\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e_{(1)}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{4+2(x^3)^2}}\left[ \left(x^3-\sqrt{2+(x^3)^2}\right)\partial_0+\left(1+(x^3)^2-x^3\sqrt{2+(x^3)^2}\right)\partial_1+\partial_2\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e_{(2)}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{4+2(x^3)^2}}\left[ \left(x^3+\sqrt{2+(x^3)^2}\right)\partial_0+\left(1+(x^3)^2+x^3\sqrt{2+(x^3)^2}\right)\partial_1+\partial_2\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e_{(3)}=\partial_3&lt;/math&gt;

It is straightforward to verify that e&lt;sub&gt;(0)&lt;/sub&gt; is timelike, e&lt;sub&gt;(1)&lt;/sub&gt;, e&lt;sub&gt;(2)&lt;/sub&gt;, e&lt;sub&gt;(3)&lt;/sub&gt; are spacelike, that they are all [[orthogonal]], and that there are no singularities.  The corresponding proper time is

:&lt;math&gt;{d \tau}^{2} = -(dx^0)^2 +4(x^3)(dx^0)(dx^2)-2(dx^1)(dx^2)-2(x^3)^2(dx^2)^2-(dx^3)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Riemann tensor]] has only one algebraically independent, nonzero component

:&lt;math&gt;R_{0202}=-1,&lt;/math&gt;

which shows that the spacetime is [[Ricci flat]] but not [[conformally flat]].  That is sufficient to conclude that it is a vacuum solution distinct from Minkowski spacetime.  Under a suitable coordinate transformation, the metric can be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;
d\tau^2 = [(x^2 - y^2) \cos (2u) + 2xy \sin(2u)] du^2 - 2dudv - dx^2 - dy^2
&lt;/math&gt;

and is therefore an example of a [[pp-wave spacetime]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3309">A '''rank abundance curve''' or '''Whittaker plot''' is a chart used by ecologists to display [[relative species abundance]], a component of [[biodiversity]]. It can also be used to visualize [[species richness]] and [[species evenness]]. It overcomes the shortcomings of [[diversity index|biodiversity indices]] that cannot display the relative role different variables played in their calculation.

[[Image:Rank abundance chart.JPG|thumb|A rank abundance curve]]

The curve is a 2D chart with relative abundance on the Y-axis and the abundance rank on the X-axis.
* X-axis: The abundance rank. The most abundant species is given rank 1, the second most abundant is 2 and so on.
* Y-axis: The relative abundance. Usually measured on a log scale, this is a measure of a species abundance (e.g., the number of individuals) relative to the abundance of other species.

==Interpreting a rank abundance curve==
The rank abundance curve visually depicts both species richness and species evenness. Species richness can be viewed as the number of different species on the chart i.e., how many species were ranked. Species evenness is reflected in the slope of the line that fits the graph (assuming a linear, i.e. logarithmic series, relationship). A steep gradient indicates low evenness as the high-ranking species have much higher abundances than the low-ranking species. A shallow gradient indicates high evenness as the abundances of different species are similar.

==Quantitative comparison of rank abundance curves==
Quantitative comparison of rank abundance curves of different communities can be done using RADanalysis package in [[R (programming language)|R]]. This package uses the [[max rank normalization]] method&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Saeedghalati | first1 = M. | title = Quantitative Comparison of Abundance Structures of Generalized Communities: From B-Cell Receptor Repertoires to Microbiomes | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005362 | journal = PLoS Comput. Biol. | volume =  | issue =  | pages =  | year = 2017 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which a rank abundance distribution is made by normalization of rank abundance curves of communities to the same number of ranks and then normalize the relative abundances to one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1952">'''Rudolf Ruedemann''' (October 16, 1864&amp;ndash;June 18, 1956) was a [[German American]] [[paleontologist]], widely known as an expert in [[graptolite]]s, enigmatic fossil animals. He worked at the [[New York State Museum]] for over 40 years, including a decade as State Paleontologist of New York. and was elected to the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1928. Born in [[Georgenthal]], Germany, he was educated in Europe, earning a PhD in 1887 from the [[University of Jena]] (Ph.D., 1887), and a second doctorate in 1889 from France's [[University of Strasbourg]] where he was an assistant in geology from 1887 to 1892.  He emigrated to the United States in 1892 and taught at the high schools of [[Lowville (village), New York|Lowville]] and [[Dolgeville, New York]] for several years before joining the State Museum in 1899, where he worked for the remainder of his career. Although his primary interests were in graptolites he also made contributions to other areas of invertebrate paleontology, describing new species of fossil corals, [[eurypterids]] ("sea scorpions"), [[trilobites]], and [[cephalopods]].

He was married with a daughter and six sons, and retired in 1937.

A '''shore''' or a '''shoreline''' is the fringe of land at the edge of a large [[body of water]], such as an [[ocean]], [[sea]], or [[lake]]. In [[physical oceanography]], a shore is the wider fringe that is geologically modified by the action of the body of water past and present, while the [[beach]] is at the edge of the shore, representing the [[intertidal zone]] where there is one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=7–8|title=Descriptive Physical Oceanography|first=George L. |last=Pickard|author2=William J. Emery |edition=5, illustrated|publisher=Elsevier|year=1990|isbn=075062759X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to a [[coast]], a shore can border any body of water, while the coast must border an [[ocean]]; in that sense a coast is a type of shore; however, coast often refers to an area far wider than the shore, often stretching miles into the interior.

Shores are influenced by the [[topography]] of the surrounding landscape, as well as by water induced [[erosion]], such as [[Wind wave|waves]].  The [[geology|geological]] composition of [[Rock (geology)|rock]] and [[soil]] dictates the type of shore which is created.

==Rivieras==
''Riviera'' is an Italian word for "shoreline",&lt;ref name="Chambers"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=riviera |encyclopedia=Chambers Concise Dictionary |year=2004 |publisher=Allied Chambers |location=New Delhi |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=iwWuY9tAVq8C&amp;pg=PA1045 1045] |isbn = 9788186062364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kolb"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Martina |last=Kolb |year=2013 |title=Nietzsche, Freud, Benn, and the Azure Spell of Liguria |location=Toronto, Ontario |publisher=University of Toronto Press |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=I03va9L2GuoC&amp;pg=PA30 30] |isbn=978-1-4426-4329-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The more common ones are ''puntellare'' and ''litorale''.&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately derived from Latin ''ripa'' ("riverbank"). It came to be applied as a proper name to the coast of the [[Ligurian Sea]], in the form ''riviera ligure'', then shortened to ''riviera''.  Historically, the Ligurian Riviera extended from Capo Corvo (Punta Bianca) south of Genoa, north and west into what is now French territory past [[Monaco]] and sometimes as far as [[Marseilles]].&lt;ref name="Chambers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Rosa |last=Baughan |year=1880 |title=Winter havens in the sunny South, a complete handbook to the Riviera |location=London |publisher=The Bazaar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zg8IAAAAQAAJ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202104650/https://books.google.com/books?id=zg8IAAAAQAAJ |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Charles B. |last=Black |year=1887 |title=The Riviera, Or The Coast from Marseilles to Leghorn, Including Carrara, Lucca, Pisa, Pistoja and Florence |edition=Third |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Adam and Charles Black |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KKsaAAAAYAAJ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202213756/https://books.google.com/books?id=KKsaAAAAYAAJ |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Now it is divided into the [[Italian Riviera]] and the [[French Riviera]], although the French use the term "Riviera" to refer to the Italian Riviera and call the French portion the "Côte d'Azur".&lt;ref name="Kolb" /&gt;

As a result of the fame of the Ligurian rivieras, the term came into English to refer to any shoreline, especially one that is sunny, topographically diverse and popular with tourists.&lt;ref name="Chambers" /&gt; Such places using the term include the [[Australian Riviera]] in [[Queensland]] and the [[Turkish Riviera]] along the [[Aegean Sea]].&lt;ref name="Kolb" /&gt;

'''''The Beginning or the End''''' is a 1947 American [[docudrama]] film about the development of the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] in [[World War II]], directed by [[Norman Taurog]], starring [[Brian Donlevy]] and [[Hume Cronyn]], and released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. The film dramatizes the creation of the atomic bomb in the [[Manhattan Project]] and the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombing of Hiroshima]].

The film originated in October 1945 as a project of actress [[Donna Reed]] and her high school science teacher, Edward R. Tompkins, who was a chemist at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]. [[Bob Considine]] wrote the treatment, which was sent to MGM script writers. The title was supplied by  [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]]. At the time there was a legal requirement that permission be obtained to depict living well-known public figures. Many refused, but others, such as [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], co-operated. [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie Groves|Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], the director of the Manhattan Project, was hired as a consultant for $10,000 ({{Inflation|US|10000|1946|fmt=eq|r=-3}}).

Although the filmmakers put considerable effort into historical accuracy, particularly in details, the film is known for some key distortions of history. An entirely fictional sequence was added in which Truman agonizes over whether to authorize the attack; anti-aircraft shells are shown bursting around the ''[[Enola Gay]]'' on its bombing run over Hiroshima; and it is said that leaflets were dropped on Hiroshima for ten days in advance of the mission warning the citizens of the forthcoming raid. The film received generally mixed reviews, and was a box office disappointment.

==Plot==
In 1945, physicist and atomic scientist Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer ([[Hume Cronyn]]) praises the discovery of atomic energy, but also warns of its dangers. American scientists such as Matt Cochran ([[Tom Drake]]), working under the guidance of Dr. [[Enrico Fermi]] ([[Joseph Calleia]]) and Dr. Marré ([[Victor Francen]]), have split the atom, and essentially beaten the Germans in the race to create an atomic bomb. With the assistance of [[Albert Einstein]] ([[Ludwig Stössel]]), they inform [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ([[Godfrey Tearle]]) that a monumental discovery has been made.

In 1941, with the United States at war, Roosevelt authorizes up to two billion dollars for the [[Manhattan Project]] to develop an atomic bomb. In December 1942, at the [[University of Chicago]], under the watchful eyes of observers such as Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Nixon ([[Robert Walker (actor, born 1918)|Robert Walker]]) and international experts, scientists create the first chain reaction, under a stadium at the campus.

Nixon is assigned to General Leslie Groves ([[Brian Donlevy]]), who is placed in charge of the project. Groves has to bring together the scientific, industrial and defense communities to build the atomic bomb. In 1945, following the death of Roosevelt, the new president, [[Harry S. Truman]] ([[Art Baker (actor)|Art Baker]]), continues to support the atomic project, now moved to [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]]. When refined [[uranium-235]] is obtained, the first atomic bomb is built and tested successfully in the New Mexico desert. Facing stiff resistance in the [[Pacific War]], Truman orders the use of the atomic bomb against Japan in July 1945.

Cochran and Nixon are assigned to accompany the crew transporting the bomb to [[Tinian]]. While assembling the bomb, the scientist comes into contact with radioactive material and dies. The following day, on August 6, 1945, the ''[[Enola Gay]]'', a [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] bomber, drops an atomic bomb on [[Hiroshima]]. After the mission, Nixon returns home to break the news of her husband's death to Cochran's wife.{{#tag:ref|This fictional incident in the film recalls the deaths of [[physicist]] and [[chemist]] [[Harry Daghlian]] and [[Louis Slotin]], members of the Manhattan Project who died after contact with radioactive material on 21 August 1945 and 21 May 1946.{{sfn|Jungk|1958|pp=194–196}}|group=Note}}

Tompkins, a chemist at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]].{{sfn|Yavenditti|1978|p=54}} According to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' issues of December 1945 and January 1946, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] and [[20th Century-Fox]] were all interested in making a film about the Manhattan Project. Paramount's [[Hal B. Wallis]] was already working on his own version, titled ''Top Secret'', but agreed to merge his project with MGM's and hand over his story and research, offering to serve as an adviser on the MGM treatment in return for a fixed fee and a percentage of the box office gross.&lt;ref name="notes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/1531/The-Beginning-or-the-End/notes.html |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |title=Notes: The Beginning or the End (1947)|accessdate=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Beginning or the End'' had a number of working titles, including ''Atom Bomb'', ''The Manhattan Project'' and  ''Top Secret''. [[Bob Considine]] was hired to produce a treatment, which was submitted to MGM writers.&lt;ref name="notes"/&gt; The script underwent a number of revisions, with [[Ayn Rand]] being one of the writers. Her contributions include the montage of Hitler's conquests, a sequence in which a dying informant sends a message to Albert Einstein, and the sequence in which President Franklin Roosevelt authorizes the Manhattan Project. Other writers involved with the script were Robert Smith, [[Frank Wead|Frank "Spig" Wead]], [[Norman Krasna]], [[David Hawkins (philosopher)|David Hawkins]], [[John Lee Mahin]] and [[Glenn Tryon]]. Producer [[Samuel Marx]] wrote  the opening narration.&lt;ref name="TCM"&gt;{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Nathaniel. |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/1531/The-Beginning-or-the-End/articles.html |title=Articles: The Beginning or the End (1947)|publisher=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Marx and Donna Reed's husband Tony Owen met with President Harry S. Truman to secure his approval. At their meeting, Truman is reported to have said: "Gentlemen, make a motion picture. Tell the people of this nation that for them it is the beginning or the end," thereby supplying the movie with its title.{{sfn|Yavenditti|1978|p=54}}

H. T. Wensel from the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Bureau of Standards]], Tompkins, and W. Bradford Shank from the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] acted as technical advisers.&lt;ref name="SMEC"/&gt; Relations between MGM and the scientists soon soured, as the scientists began asking for more accuracy which required  multiple script changes, and Tompkins eventually resigned. Oppenheimer sent David Hawkins, a philosophy professor from the [[University of California]] to act as a mediator between Marx and the scientists.{{sfn|Yavenditti|1978|p=56}} Although the original intention was that a substantial sum of money would be donated to scientists' associations like the [[Federation of American Scientists|Federation of Atomic Scientists]], in the end, no scientific organizations accepted any money.{{sfn|Yavenditti|1978|p=63}} Tompkins received payment of one hundred dollars.  ({{Inflation|US|100|1946|fmt=eq|r=-3}}).{{sfn|Reingold|1984|p=156}} At the time, there was a legal requirement that permission be obtained to depict living well-known public figures in films.{{sfn|Reingold|1984|p=156}} [[Lise Meitner]], [[Niels Bohr]] and Sir [[James Chadwick]] all refused to allow their names to be used in ''The Beginning or the End'', which Marx regarded as unfortunate, as it made the film's Manhattan Project scenes look like an all-American affair.{{sfn|Yavenditti|1978|p=56}}

The loss of Bohr caused important sequences to be deleted. The script originally had Bohr, rescued from the Germans in Denmark, bring a shocked Oppenheimer news that the [[German nuclear weapon project]] was supplying expertise to its [[Japanese nuclear weapon program|Japanese counterpart]]. A German submarine carrying a fictional scientist travels to Japan where he joins the Japanese project in [[Hiroshima]].{{sfn|Reingold|1984|p=162}} [[Vannevar Bush]] objected to the way the script depicted him as having doubts about whether the atomic bomb could be built in time or could fit into an aircraft. Bush insisted that he never had any doubts. The script was changed to soften this. In the film, when Bush tells President  Roosevelt that he has a top secret matter to discuss, the President's dog [[Fala (dog)|Fala]] leaves the room.{{sfn|Reingold|1984|p=161}}

Oppenheimer raised no objection to the sequence in the film in which he informed Brigadier General [[Thomas Farrell (general)|Thomas Farrell]] that the odds of a runaway explosion destroying the planet were less than one in a million, although he told MGM that he never said this.{{sfn|Reingold|1984|pp=162–163}} The cultured Oppenheimer's main concern was that the script was poor, with characters that were "stilted, lifeless, and without purpose or insight."{{sfn|Reingold|1984|p=159}}

Military technical advisers for ''The Beginning or the End'' included Colonel William A. Considine, Groves's assistant in charge of in charge of Security and Public Relations, Major Glen W. Landreth, Major Paul Van Sloun and Lieutenant Colonel [[Charles Sweeney|Charles W. Sweeney]], the pilot of ''[[Bockscar]]'', the bomber that dropped the second atomic bomb on [[Nagasaki]].&lt;ref name="SMEC"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=SMEC Vintage Electrics |volume=3 |issue=1 |year=1991 |url=http://www.smecc.org/post_-_ww2_afrs-afrts.htm |title=Armed Forces Radio After World War II |first=Edward A. |last=Sharpe |accessdate=December 31, 2014 |publisher=SMEC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists were alarmed by reports that MGM leading man [[Clark Gable]] was being considered for the role of Groves, but were relieved when Brian Donlevy was cast instead. Donlevy usually appeared in villainous supporting roles  {{sfn|Yavenditti|1978|pp=55–56}} and indeed, most of the actors cast in the movie were best known for [[film noir]] : Hume Cronyn for ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]''; Joseph Calleia, for ''[[Gilda]]'' and ''[[Deadline at Dawn]]''; and Ludwig Stössel for [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Cloak and Dagger (1946 film)|Cloak and Dagger]]''.&lt;ref name="TCM" /&gt; Groves's cooperation  was secured by hiring him as a primary consultant, for $10,000 ({{Inflation|US|10000|1946|fmt=eq|r=-3}}). The portly Groves apparently had no objection to his portrayal by the slim and handsome Donlevy, except for the way in which he was shown bossing industrialists around. He had a scene in which he warned Roosevelt that the [[Operation Downfall|invasion of Japan]] would be opposed by Japanese nuclear weapons deleted.{{sfn|Reingold|1984|p=162}}

[[Eleanor Roosevelt]] objected to the casting of [[Lionel Barrymore]] as her late husband, due to political remarks that Barrymore had made about the president in 1944.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;{{sfn|Yavenditti|1978|p=57}} Marx delayed Barrymore's scenes while she had a chance to read and respond to a letter Barrymore sent her explaining that his remarks had been misinterpreted, but she was not placated, and Barrymore was replaced in the role by Godfrey Tearle.&lt;ref name="notes"/&gt; The War Department and the White House reviewed the script, and both asked for changes. The Army had objected to a scene in which an Army major made a pass at a girl and it was cut from the film, as the Army felt that this was poor conduct for an officer.{{sfn|Yavenditti|1978|p=57}} 

The casual way that Truman and Groves were shown to decide to use the bomb, with Truman stating that "I think more of our American boys than I do of all our enemies",&lt;ref name="The Nation"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/142580/white-house-cover-how-truman-edited-hollywoods-first-movie-about-atomic-bomb# |title=White House Cover-Up: How Truman Edited Hollywood's First Movie About the Atomic Bomb |first=Greg |last=Mitchell |first2=Robert Jay |last2=Lifton |date=August 3, 2010 |newspaper=[[The Nation]]  |accessdate=February 12, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while accurate, troubled [[Walter Lippmann]], who felt that it could lead to foreigners being fearful of atomic weapons being in American hands. It was replaced with a scene where Truman agonizes over whether to authorize the attack or not.{{sfn|Yavenditti|1978|p=57}} In it, Truman asserts that dropping the bomb will shorten the war, and a "year less of war will mean life for&amp;nbsp;... from 300,000 to half a million of America's finest youth".&lt;ref name="The Nation"/&gt;

The motion picture censors asked for further cuts.  Derogatory references to Mexicans were removed, as was an off-color joke about the effects of exposure to radioactive substances ("Is it true if you fool around with that stuff you don't like girls anymore?" "Not that I've noticed"), and one about politics ("I got it confidential−we're makin' the front ends of horses. We ship 'em to Washington to hook on to the other end.")&lt;ref name="TCM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,801873-1,00.html|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|title=The New Pictures |date=February 24, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Principal photography for ''The Beginning or the End'' began on April 29, 1946, and continued until July 25 with retakes beginning on August 9, 1946. The production premiered in Washington, D.C. on February 19, 1947, with the national release of the film following on March 7, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/1531/The-Beginning-or-the-End/original-print-info.html |title=Original Print Information: The Beginning or the End |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |accessdate=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accuracy==
The filmmakers put considerable effort into many details for historical accuracy, such as military uniforms, and the details of the ''Enola Gay'' and its crew.&lt;ref name="TCM"/&gt; Nine of the actors who portrayed  the ''Enola Gay'' crew were actual veterans of World War II.&lt;ref name="notes"/&gt; However, the technical details of atomic processes and the bomb's design are wildly inaccurate by intention. In 1947, these details were highly classified. Another inaccuracy, independent of necessary military secrecy, is the portrayal of anti-aircraft shells bursting around the aircraft on the bombing run, as the attack on Hiroshima was not opposed.{{sfn|Roling|Cassese|1994|p=112}}{{#tag:ref|However, the raid on Nagasaki was engaged by Japanese anti-aircraft  fire.{{sfn|Sweeney|Antonucci|Antonucci|1997|pp=213–215}}|group=Note}}

The film twice refers to supposed specific leaflet drops on the target for ten days in advance of the mission warning the citizens of the forthcoming raid. "We've been dropping warning leaflets on them for ten days now", one crew member remarks, "That's ten days more warning than they gave us before Pearl Harbor."{{sfn|Yavenditti|1978|p=59}} However, there was no leaflet specifically warning of an atomic attack.{{sfn|Yavenditti|1978|p=59}} In his review in the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'', physicist [[Harrison Brown]] called this "the most horrible falsification of history".&lt;ref name="Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] |issn=0096-3402 |title=The Beginning or the End: A Review |first=Harrison |last=Brown |authorlink=Harrison Brown |page=99 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=_AsAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=February 13, 2015 |volume=3 |issue=3 |date=March 1947 |doi=10.1080/00963402.1947.11455861}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians &lt;!-- See Talk:Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki for a discussion --&gt; have debated whether any leaflets were dropped at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/04/26/a-day-too-late/ |title=A Day Too Late |first=Alex |last=Wellerstein |date=April 26, 2013 |accessdate=December 31, 2014 |publisher=Restricted Data }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Although ''The Beginning or the End'' was the first film to depict the story of the atomic bomb, both critics and the public were confused by the attempt to merge real events in a docudrama form. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented, "... despite its generally able reenactments, this film is so laced with sentiment of the silliest and most theatrical nature that much of its impressiveness is marred."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C06E3D6133EEE3BBC4951DFB466838C659EDE |title=The Beginning or the End (1947); Atomic bomb film starts at Capital; Beginning or the End, Metro study of historic weapons, has Donlevy as Groves |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 21, 1947 |accessdate=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the film as a "portentous tale in broad strokes of masterful scripting and production",&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |url=https://variety.com/1946/film/reviews/the-beginning-or-the-end-1200414996/ |title=Review: 'The Beginning or the End' |date=December 31, 1946 |accessdate=February 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "sum credit of everybody concerned that the documentary values are sufficiently there without becoming static".&lt;ref name="Variety"/&gt; In his ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'' review, Harrison Brown considered the movie "poor", with a romantic angle "insipid in the extreme",&lt;ref name="Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists"/&gt; but was most troubled by way  scientific equipment was "over-glamorized" in the film, which he felt gave "a completely false impression of how scientists work."&lt;ref name="Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists" /&gt; The review in [[Time (magazine)|Time]] was less positive, noting that, "even as entertainment ... the picture seldom rises above cheery imbecility."&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

According to MGM records, ''The Beginning or the End'' was made on a budget of $2,632,000 ({{Inflation|US|2632000|1946|fmt=eq|r=-3}}), but earned $1,221,000 ({{Inflation|US|1221000|1946|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) in the United States and Canada and $721,000 ({{Inflation|US|721000|1946|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) elsewhere, resulting in a loss to the studio of $1,596,000 ({{Inflation|US|1596000|1946|fmt=eq|r=-3}}).{{sfn|Mannix|1962}}

'''Theodore George “Ted” Paraskevakos''' ({{lang-el|Θεόδωρος Παρασκευάκος}}; born March 25, 1937, in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]) is a Greek-American inventor and businessman. Paraskevakos graduated from the Superior College of Electronics in Greece and served for 28 months as communications and electronics instructor in the [[Hellenic Air Force]]. He attended a variety of courses for digital engineering in [[Alabama]] and in [[Florida]].

[[Image:Caller ID receiver.jpg|thumb|The first caller identification receiver]]
Paraskevakos' most notable inventions relate to the transmission of electronic data through telephone lines which formed the original basis for what is now known as [[caller ID]].&lt;ref name="BW" /&gt;  Paraskevakos began his work in this field in 1968 while working as a communications engineer with [[SITA (IT company)|SITA]] and has since been issued over 20 [[patents]] worldwide based on this [[technology]]. His  [[transmitter]]&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent #3,812,296/5-21-1974 (''Apparatus for Generating and Transmitting Digital Information'')&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Receiver (information theory)|receiver]]&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent #3,727,003/4-10-1973 (''Decoding and Display Apparatus for Groups of Pulse Trains'')&lt;/ref&gt; were put into practice in 1971 in a [[Boeing]] facility in [[Huntsville, Alabama]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Paraskevakos holds over 50 patents worldwide including a digital alarm communication system, which also covered handheld or portable cardiac alarms&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent #3,842,208/10-15-1974 (''Sensor Monitoring Device'')&lt;/ref&gt; [[automatic meter reading]] and [[load management]],&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patents #4,241,237/12-23-1980 and #4,455,453/1-19-1984 (''Apparatus and Method for Remote Sensor Monitoring, Metering and Control'') as well as #7,940,901/5-10-2011 (''Remote Management of Products and Services'')&lt;/ref&gt; digital vending machine communications,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent #4,858,743/8-22-1989 (''Vending Machine and Method for Automatic Vending and Returning of Merchandise, Particularly Videocassette Tapes'')&lt;/ref&gt; indoor archery,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patents #4,623,145/11-18-1986 and #4,708,341/11-24-1987 (''Archery/Practice Device and Attachments Therefor'')&lt;/ref&gt; vertical parking, intelligent currency validation network,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patents #7,006,664/2-28-2006 (''Intelligent Currency Validation Network''), #7,454,049/11-18-2008 (''System and Method for Intelligent Currency Validation''), #7,567,698/7-28-2009 (''Device and Method for Preventing Counterfeiting Using a Currency Serial Number Reader'') and #7,724,938/5-25-2010 (''System and Method for Intelligent Currency Validation'')&lt;/ref&gt; and a method for identification of currency used in unlawful activity.&lt;ref&gt;Legionpatient [https://www.legionpatent.com/patents/7567698/    698 Paraskevakos Device and method for preventing counterfeiting using a currency serial number reader]&lt;/ref&gt;  He founded, among other companies, Metretek, Inc., DataVend, Inc. and Intelligent Currency Validation Network, Inc.&lt;ref name="BW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=99411576&amp;privcapId=84684310&amp;previousCapId=84684310&amp;previousTitle=ICVN,%20Inc.|title=Theodore Paraskevakos: Executive Profile &amp; Biography|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/2003/11/10/smallb3.html?page=all|title=Inventor reveals the names behind numbers|last=Milani|first=Kate|date=10 November 2003|work=[[American City Business Journals]]|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, '''univariate''' refers to an [[expression (mathematics)|expression]], [[equation]], [[function (mathematics)|function]] or [[polynomial]] of only one [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]. Objects of any of these types involving more than one variable may be called [[wikt:multivariate|multivariate]]. In some cases the distinction between the univariate and multivariate cases is fundamental; for example, the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] and [[Euclid's algorithm for polynomials]] are fundamental properties of univariate polynomials that cannot be generalized to multivariate polynomials.

The term is commonly used in [[statistics]] to distinguish a [[Frequency distribution|distribution]] of one variable from a distribution of several variables, although it can be applied in other ways as well. For example, univariate data are composed of a single [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] component. In [[time series analysis]], the term is applied with a whole time series as the object referred to: thus a [[univariate time series]] refers to the set of values over time of a single quantity. Correspondingly, a "multivariate time series" refers to the changing values over time of several quantities. Thus there is a minor conflict of terminology since the values within a univariate time series may be treated using certain types of [[multivariate statistics|multivariate statistical analyses]] and may be represented using [[Joint distributions|multivariate distributions]].

[[Image:Gascoigne's micrometer as drawn by Robert Hooke.JPG|thumb|right|150px| Gascoigne's Micrometer as drawn by Robert Hooke]]

'''William Gascoigne''' (1612 – 2 July 1644) was an [[England|English]] [[astronomer]], [[mathematician]] and maker of [[Measuring instrument|scientific instrument]]s from [[Middleton, Leeds]] who invented the [[micrometer]]. He was one of a group of astronomers in the north of England who followed the astronomy of [[Johannes Kepler]] which included, [[Jeremiah Horrocks]] and [[William Crabtree]].

== Life and work ==

'''Gascoigne''' was born in [[Middleton, Leeds]] in 1611, the son of a minor country gentleman. His father was Henry Gascoigne, Esq., of [[Thorpe on the Hill, West Yorkshire|Thorpe-on-the-Hill]] in the parish of [[Rothwell, West Yorkshire|Rothwell]], near [[Leeds]], Yorkshire. His mother was Margaret Jane, daughter of William Cartwright. Little is known of his early life. He claimed he was educated at the [[University of Oxford]], although no record of this has been found.&lt;ref name="journals.cambridge.org"&gt;[http://www.journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=303461 Jeremiah Horrocks, William Crabtree, and the Lancashire observations of the transit of Venus of 1639], Allan Chapman, Transits of Venus: New Views of the Solar System and Galaxy, Proceedings IAU Colloquium No. 196, 2004, D.W. Kurtz, ed. doi:10.1017/S1743921305001225 (PDF) Retrieved 24 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1630s, Gascoigne, was working on a [[Johannes Kepler|Keplerian]] [[optical]] arrangement when a thread from a spider’s web happened to become caught at exactly the combined optical focal points of the two lenses. When he looked through the arrangement Gascoigne saw the web bright and sharp within the field of view. He realized that he could more accurately point the telescope using the line as a guide, and went on to invent the telescopic sight by placing crossed wires at the focal point to define the centre of the field of view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/deepimpact/collaborative_ed_module/4clarify/STWhatGoesAround.pdf NASA’s Deep Impact Mission: Decision Making], What Goes Around Comes Around, Retrieved 24 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He then added this arrangement to a sextant modelled on the instrument used by [[Tycho Brahe]], although Tycho’s sextant was only a naked-eye instrument. Gascoigne's [[sextant]] was five feet in radius, and measured the distance between astronomical bodies to an unprecedented degree of accuracy. Gascoigne then realised that by introducing two points, whose separation could be adjusted using a screw, he could measure the size of the image enclosed by them. Using the known pitch of the screw, and knowing the focal length of the lens producing the image, he could work out the size of the object, such as the Moon or the planets, to a hitherto unattainable degree of accuracy.&lt;ref name="journals.cambridge.org"/&gt;

Gascoigne met the Lancashire astronomer [[William Crabtree]], probably in 1640. After making observations at Gascoigne's home, Crabtree was much taken with these inventions and immediately saw their significance. On his return to his home in Broughton, just outside [[Manchester]], he wrote to Gascoigne asking if he might obtain such instruments and also wrote to his friend [[Jeremiah Horrocks]] about them. He wrote again to Gascoigne on 28 December 1640 saying, &lt;blockquote&gt;
My friend Mr. Horrox professeth that little touch which I gave him hath ravished his mind quite from itself and left him in an Exstasie between Admiration and Amazement. I beseech you Sir, slack not your Intentions for the Perfection of your begun Wonders.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;  Sadly, Horrocks died before he could try out the instruments, but Crabtree and Gascoigne did use them to try to corroborate Horrocks's theories about the elliptical orbit of the Moon.&lt;ref name="journals.cambridge.org"/&gt;

This invention was later taken up and improved by the scientist and astronomer [[Richard Towneley]] who was the nephew of Gascoigne's friend Christopher Towneley. Towneley later brought the instrument to the attention of [[Robert Hooke]], who used it to calculate the size of comets and other celestial bodies. The micrometer, as it became known, was to lie at the heart of astronomical measurement down to the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rod.beavon.clara.net/leonardo.htm England's Leonardo: Robert Hooke (1635-1703) and the art of experiment in Restoration England] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030235901/http://www.rod.beavon.clara.net/leonardo.htm |date=30 October 2007 }}, ALLAN CHAPMAN, Retrieved 24 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1642, [[English Civil War|civil war broke out in England]], and Gascoigne received a commission as Providore for [[Yorkshire]] in the army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. Crabtree lived in Broughton, just outside [[Manchester]] which was on the parliamentary side and all correspondence between the two ceased.

Gascoigne died at the [[Battle of Marston Moor]], [[Yorkshire]], on 2 July 1644 as did [[Towneley (family)|Charles Towneley]], the father of his friend Richard Towneley.&lt;ref name="journals.cambridge.org"/&gt;

After Gascoigne's death some of his papers and fragments of correspondence between Crabtree and Gascoigne came into the possession of Christopher and Richard Towneley. They brought them to the attention of [[John Flamsteed]], the first [[Astronomer Royal]], who came to see Horrocks, Crabtree, and Gascoigne as the founding fathers of British research astronomy and the intellectual heirs of Galileo and Kepler. He began his massive three-folio volume ''Historia Coelestis Britannica'' (1725) by printing five pages of their surviving letters and observations, made between 1638 and 1643.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=303461 P. 12 Retrieved 25 November 2007 {{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Gascoigne's papers and correspondence were lost during the [[English Civil War]] and later in the [[Great Fire of London]], but most of what is known to remain is kept in the [[Bodleian Library]] at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/1500-1900/towneley/towneley000.html Catalogue of the scientific and antiquarian papers of Christopher and Richard Towneley, 17th-18th cent.

==Legacy==
In March 2018 Leeds Civic Trust unveiled a blue plaque in the city honouring Gascoigne. It was unveiled, David Sellers, who has written a biography of Gascoigne, who said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although his name is known by astronomers, his role as a pioneer in precision astronomy deserves wider public recognition.  I hope that this plaque will help to achieve this and will encourage young people to follow his lead and inspire an interest in the natural world.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Local MP [[Hilary Benn]] was also present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southleedslife.com/belle-isle-blue-plaque-honours-early-astronomer/|title=Belle Isle blue plaque honours early astronomer - South Leeds Life|date=24 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yvonne Darlene Cagle''' (born April 24, 1959) is an American astronaut.

==Education==
Born in [[West Point, New York]], Yvonne Cagle graduated from [[Novato High School]] in [[Novato, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsu.edu/news/prsrelea/fy98/072.htm|title=Astronaut Yvonne Cagle named S.F.

She completed a transitional internship at Highland General Hospital in [[Oakland, California]] in 1985 and received a certificate in Aerospace Medicine from the School of Aerospace Medicine at [[Brooks Air Force Base]], Texas, in 1988. She then went on to complete a residency in family practice at Ghent FP at [[Eastern Virginia Medical School]] in 1992 and received certification as a senior aviation medical examiner from the Federal Aviation Administration in 1995.

==US Air Force==
Cagle retired from the United States Air Force with the rank of Colonel in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hornetsplashdown.com/yvonne-cagle/ |title=Dr. Yvonne Cagle — Splashdown 45 - USS Hornet Museum Celebrates Apollo 11 Anniversary |publisher=Hornetsplashdown.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/cagle.html |title=Astronaut Bio: Yvonne Cagle (9/2014) |publisher=Jsc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1989 as a commissioned medical officer assigned to the 48th Tactical Hospital, United Kingdom, Cagle served as Air Force Medical Liaison Officer for STS-30 mission to test the Magellan spacecraft, before she became a NASA astronaut.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; She worked as medical doctor at NASA's Occupational Health Clinic from 1994 to 1996.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In 1996 she was selected for astronaut training by NASA.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Astronaut career==
Yvonne Cagle was a member of the [[Astronaut]] Class of 1996 ([[NASA Astronaut Group 16]]). She is currently assigned to Johnson Space Center's Space and Life Sciences Directorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/cagle.html |title=Astronaut Bio: Yvonne Cagle (6/2007) |publisher=Jsc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cagle is also an advisor for NASA's Flight Opportunities Program (originally named CRuSR – Commercial Reusable Suborbital Research Program).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA Flight Opportunities |url=https://flightopportunities.nasa.gov/ |author=NASA |accessdate=2013-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently Dr. Cagle is on faculty and serves as the NASA liaison for exploration and space development with [[Singularity University]]. During the workshop, Dr. Cagle was embedded with the crew as a crew training consultant and advisor, providing insights and feedback to both crew and study team from the viewpoint of an astronaut, flight surgeon, space development expert, and science liaison.

She has recently been selected reserve crew for Hawai'i Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS), which is part of a study for NASA to determine the best way to keep astronauts well nourished during multiple-year missions to Mars or the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hi-seas.org/ |title=Hawai'i Space Exploration Analog and Simulation mission site |publisher=Hi-Seas.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Dr. Cagle is also listed as an honorary member of the [[Danish Astronautical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rumfart.dk/vis.asp?id=34 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714164548/http://rumfart.dk/vis.asp?id=34 |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |df=mdy-all }} Official website of Danish Astronautical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Cagle was a visiting professor to [[Fordham University]] where she was participating in interdisciplinary research in health, environment and human Performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.fordham.edu/university-news/gss-and-nasa-astronaut-form-interdisciplinary-collaborative/ |title=GSS and NASA Astronaut Form Interdisciplinary Collaborative |author=Joanna Mercuri |date=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was  awarded  an  honorary  Ph.D.  by  Fordham  University  for  her substantial  and  significant  contributions  to  the  fields  of  science,  technology  and  human  health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fordham.edu/info/26213/past_honorary_degree_recipients |title=Past Honorary Degree Recipients |publisher=Fordham University |access-date=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2018, Cagle is considered a "NASA Management Astronaut", which means that she is employed at NASA but is no longer eligible for spaceflight assignments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/management |title=NASA Management Astronauts |date=May 25, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zacharias Janssen''' (also '''Zacharias Jansen''' or  '''Sacharias Jansen''') (1585 &amp;ndash; pre-1632&lt;ref&gt;birth dates range from 1580 to 1588, death given as late as 1638&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Dutch spectacle-maker from [[Middelburg]] associated with the invention of the first [[optical telescope]]. Janssen is sometimes also credited for inventing the first truly [[compound microscope]]. However, the origin of the microscope, just like the origin of the telescope, is a matter of debate.

==Biography==
Zacharias Janssen was born in [[The Hague]]. Local records seem to indicate he was born in 1580&lt;ref&gt;lbert Van Helden, Sven Dupre, Rob Van Gent, The Origins of the Telescope - 2011, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; although a date of birth as early as 1580&lt;ref name="David Whitehouse 2009, page 66."&gt;David Whitehouse, Renaissance Genius: Galileo Galilei &amp; His Legacy to Modern Science - 2009, page 67&lt;/ref&gt; or as late a 1588 are also given.&lt;ref&gt;Ari Ben-Menahem, Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences - Volume 1 - 2009, page 5294&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Hans Martens&lt;ref name="Zuidervaart"&gt;Source: a book by Huib J. Zuidervaart which is to be published in the spring of 2008. The [[Public Observatory Philippus Lansbergen]] in Middelburg has already been shown a first version of this book.&lt;/ref&gt; (who may have had the occupation of a [[peddler]])&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bGKrPVoQY8QC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Zacharias+Janssen+Frankfurt+Fair&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OUVpTYe-IpDUgQfb0PigDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Zacharias%20Janssen%20Frankfurt%20Fair&amp;f=false David Whitehouse, Renaissance Genius: Galileo Galilei &amp; His Legacy to Modern Science, pages 67]&lt;/ref&gt; and Maeyken Meertens, both probably from [[Antwerp]], Belgium. He grew up with his sister Sara in Middelburg, at the time the second most important city of the Netherlands. He was known as a "street seller" who was constantly in trouble with the local authorities.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

But he stated he was born in The Hague on the marriage file of his first marriage, with Catharina de Haene, on October 23, 1610. When this file was refound by Cornelis de Waard in 1906, De Waard found the following excerpt: ''Sacharias Jansen, j.g. uut Den Haag'', "Zacharias Jansen, bachelor from The Hague"&lt;ref name="Zuidervaart" /&gt; Before, it was often thought that Janssen was a native of Middelburg. In 1612, Zacharias and Catharina had a son they named Johannes Zachariassen.

In 1615 Zacharias was appointed guardian of two children of Lowys Lowyssen "''geseyt Henricxen brilmakers''" (''called Henry the spectacle maker''). It is surmised that Zacharias also took possession of Lowys Lowyssen's spectacle-making tools because the first record of Zacharias Janssen being a spectacle maker appears in 1616.&lt;ref&gt;Earth-Bound to Satellite: Telescopes, Skills and Networks  edited by Alison D. Morrison-Low page 60&lt;/ref&gt; The family had to move to [[Arnemuiden]] in 1618 after Zacharias's counterfeiting activities were exposed. There Zacharias was again accused of counterfeiting in 1619 causing him to be on the move again, ending up back in Middleburg in 1621.&lt;ref name="Albert Van Helden 2010, page 24"&gt;Albert Van Helden, Sven Dupre, Rob van Gent, Huib Zuidervaart, The Origins of the Telescope, KNAW Press, 2010, page 24&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after the death of Janssen's first wife in 1624, he married Anna Couget from Antwerp, who was the wife of Hans lippershey (probably father of Janssen). He moved to Amsterdam in November 1626 with a profession of a spectacle maker, but was bankrupt by 1628. Janssen has been given a death date as late as 1638&lt;ref name="David Whitehouse 2009, page 66." /&gt; although his sister said he was dead in 1632 testimony&lt;ref name="Albert Van Helden 2010, page 24"/&gt; and his son Johannes declared his parents had died by the time of his marriage in April 1632.&lt;ref name="Zuidervaart" /&gt;

==Invention of the telescope and microscope ==

Over the years of existence they have been claim Zacharias Janssen who read the telescope and or the microscope in Middelburg in between 1580 to 1800. Zacharias worked for some period of his life as spectacle-maker (a very competitive and secretive trade) and at one time lived next door to Middelburg spectacle maker [[Hans Lippershey]], also claimed to have invented the telescope. Janssen's attribution to these discoveries is debatable since there is no concrete evidence as to the actual inventor, and there are a whole series of confusing and conflicting claims from the testimony of his son and fellow countrymen.&lt;ref name="Albert Van Helden 2011, page 43"&gt;Albert Van Helden, Sven Dupre, Rob Van Gent, The Origins of the Telescope - 2011,  page 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.D. North, J.J. Roche, The Light of Nature: Essays in the History and Philosophy of Science presented to A.C. Crombie, Springer Science &amp; Business Media - 2012, page 202&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim that Zacharias Janssen invented the telescope and the microscope dates back to the year 1655. During that time Dutch diplomat [[Willem Boreel]] conducted an investigation trying to figure out who invented the telescope.&lt;ref&gt;J.D. North, J.J. Roche, The Light of Nature: Essays in the History and Philosophy of Science presented to A.C. Crombie, Springer Science &amp; Business Media - 2012, page 202&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Albert Van Helden 2011, page 43"&gt;Albert Van Helden, Sven Dupre, Rob Van Gent, The Origins of the Telescope - 2011,  page 43&lt;/ref&gt; He had a local magistrate in [[Middelburg]] follow up on a 45 year old recollection of a spectacle maker named "Hans" who told a young Boreel in 1610 about inventing the telescope. In his investigation the magistrate was contacted by a then unknown claimant, Middelburg spectacle maker Johannes Zachariassen, the son of Zacharias Janssen, who testified under oath that his father invented the telescope and the microscope as early as 1590 and that Hans Lippershey had stolen his father's invention of the telescope.&lt;ref name="Albert Van Helden 2011, page 43"/&gt; This testimony seemed to convincing to Boreel, who modified his recollections, concluding that Zacharias must have been who he remembered.&lt;ref name="HeldenDupré2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Van Helden|author2=Sven Dupré|author3=Rob van Gent|title=The Origins of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&amp;pg=PA21|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-6984-615-6|pages=21–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boreel's conclusion that Zacharias Janssen invented the telescope a little ahead of spectacle maker Hans Lippershey was adopted by [[Pierre Borel]] in his 1656 book on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Van Helden|author2=Sven Dupré|author3=Rob van Gent|title=The Origins of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&amp;pg=PA25|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-6984-615-6|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Boreel's investigation Johannes also claimed his father, Zacharias Jansen, invented the [[Optical microscope#Compound microscope|compound microscope]] in 1590. This pushes the date so early it is sometimes assumed, for the claim to be true (Zacharias most likely dates of birth would have made him 2-5 years old at the time)&lt;ref&gt;J.D. North, J.J. Roche, The Light of Nature: Essays in the History and Philosophy of Science presented to A.C. Crombie, Springer Science &amp; Business Media - 2012, page 202&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huib Zuidervaart, The ‘true inventor’ of the telescope. A survey of 400 years of debate, KNAW Press - 2012, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; grandfather Hans Martens must have invented it.&lt;ref name="The Origins of the Telescope"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Van Helden|author2=Sven Dupré|author3=Rob van Gent|title=The Origins of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&amp;pg=PA24|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-6984-615-6|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Shmaefsky, Biotechnology 101 - 2006, page 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Other claims have come forward over the years. Physicist [[Jean Henri van Swinden]]'s 1822-23 investigation reached the conclusion supporting Janssen and in 1841 a collector named Zacharias Snijder came forward with 4 iron tubes with lenses in them purported to be Janssen original telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;Huib Zuidervaart, The ‘true inventor’ of the telescope. A survey of 400 years of debate, KNAW Press - 2012, pages 30-32&lt;/ref&gt; In historian [[Cornelis de Waard]]'s 1906 book on the history of the telescope he recounted his discovery of note written in 1634 by the Dutch philosopher [[Isaac Beeckman]] in which Beeckman mentioned that Johannes Zachariassen claimed his father created his first telescope in 1604 (and that it was a copy of an Italian device from 1590).&lt;ref&gt;Henry C. King, The History of the Telescope, Courier Corporation - 1955, Page vii&lt;/ref&gt; The German astronomer [[Simon Marius]]'s account to his patron [[Johan Philip Fuchs von Bimbach]] about meeting an unnamed Dutchman at the 1608 Autumn Frankfurt Fair who tried to sell him a device that sounded like a broken telescope has led to later speculation this unnamed Dutchman could have been Zacharias Janssen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bGKrPVoQY8QC&amp;pg=PA70 David Whitehouse, ''Renaissance Genius: Galileo Galilei &amp; His Legacy to Modern Science'', pages 69–70]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
[[File:Jaansen Microscope.jpg|thumbnail|left|Reproduction of an optical device that Zacharias Snijder in 1841 claimed was an early telescope built by Jansen. Dutch biologist and naturalist [[Pieter Harting]] claimed in 1858 that this was an early microscope which he also attributed to Janssen, perpetuating the ''Janssen'' claim to both devices. Its actual function and creator has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=microscope+Zacharias+Janssen.+John+Mayall,+National+Museum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gzglPjlkAv&amp;sig=jnSQTrDeeIZaKTFx6g-lBquUC4A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j6AmUYbjAei30gGCxoHoDA&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBA#v=snippet&amp;q=snijder&amp;f=false Albert Van Helden, Sven Dupré, Rob Van Gent, Huib Zuidervaart, The Origins of the Telescope, pages 32-36]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The confusion surrounding the claim to invention of the telescope and the microscope arises in part from the (sometimes conflicting) testimony of Zacharias Janssen's son, Johannes Zachariassen. Johannes claims include that his father invented the telescope in 1590, that his father invented the telescope in 1604, that he and his father invented the telescope in 1618, and that [[Jacob Metius]] and [[Cornelis Drebbel]] bought a telescope from him and his father in 1620 and copied it.{{Clarify|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref name="Albert Van Helden page 43"&gt;Albert Van Helden, Sven Dupre, Rob Van Gent, The Origins of the Telescope - 2011, page 43&lt;/ref&gt; Johannes also seems to have lied about his own date of birth, maybe so he could stake his own claim as inventor of the telescope along with his father.&lt;ref name="Albert Van Helden page 43"/&gt;

The 1655 investigation by William Boreel (who may have been a childhood friend of Zacharias Zachariassen) added to the confusion over invention. The people he had the local magistrate interview were trying to recount details 50 or 60 years after the fact and Boreel may have confused the names of spectacle makers from his childhood. He may have also been confused about a microscope built by another optician for Drebbel, claiming it was built by Zacharias Janssen.&lt;ref name="Albert Van Helden 2011, page 43"/&gt;

An investigation begun in 1816 in preparation for a memorial to commemorate Janssen as the inventor of the telescope and microscope turned up further problems with the claim including the Lippershey and Metius patent applications, Janssen late 1585 date of birth, and no record of him being a spectacle maker before 1615.&lt;ref&gt;Huib Zuidervaart, The ‘true inventor’ of the telescope. A survey of 400 years of debate, KNAW Press - 2012, pages 26-30&lt;/ref&gt; 

Albert Van Helden, Sven Dupré, Rob Van Gent, and Huib Zuidervaart in their book "Origins of the Telescope" came to the conclusion that Janssen may not have become an optician until 1616 and that the claims surrounding him as the inventor of the telescope and the microscope were the fabrications of his own son, Johannes Zachariassen, who claimed it as a matter of fame and for possible financial gain.&lt;ref name="Albert Van Helden 2011, page 43"/&gt;

==Illegal activities==
In the years 1613–1619, Janssen was tried several times for counterfeiting coins. Janssen grew up right next to the Middleburg [[Mint (coin)|mint]] where his brother-in-law worked. These circumstances made it very easy for Janssen to mimic the process of manufacturing money. He fled to the neighbouring village of [[Arnemuiden]] to avoid the high penalties for counterfeiting coins.&lt;ref name="Zuidervaart"/&gt;

However, he continued counterfeiting coins in Arnemuiden. In 1619 he was apprehended for owning several devices he counterfeited coins with. Normally, one would have been sentenced to death for this crime. However, since the father of the Arnemuiden [[bailiff]] was found to be an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]], he was pardoned from this punishment. Thanks to this, the process was delayed to such an extent that Janssen was able to flee again. Eventually, the case was dismissed. Janssen returned to Middleburg in 1621.&lt;ref name="Zuidervaart" /&gt;

==Historical record==
Janssen's life was documented by the many investigations on the subject before the Second World War. Many of the Middelburg archives were destroyed by a [[Battle of Zeeland#Bombing of Middelburg|bombing of Middelburg]] on May 17, 1940, during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] invasion of the [[Netherlands]]. Without these earlier studies, very little would be known of Janssen's life at all because all original files were lost in the fires following the bombardment.
