The '''Sydney Ghost Train fire''' was a fire on the night of 9 June 1979 at [[Luna Park Sydney]]. The fire killed six children and one adult, and destroyed the amusement park's [[ghost train (ride)|ghost train]]. Inadequate fire-fighting measures and low staffing caused the fire to completely destroy the ride, which was first constructed in 1931, and had been transported from [[Glenelg, South Australia]] to [[Milsons Point, New South Wales]] during 1934 and 1935.

Originally the fire was blamed on electrical faults, but arson by unknown figures has also been claimed. The exact cause of the fire could not be determined by a [[coronial inquiry]]. The coroner also ruled that, while the actions of Luna Park's management and staff before and during the fire (in particular their choosing not to follow advice on the installation of a sprinkler system in the ride) breached their [[duty of care]], charges of [[criminal negligence]] should not be laid. The case was reopened in 1987: no new findings were made, although the police investigation and coronial inquiry were criticised. The fire forced the closure of Luna Park until 1982, when it reopened under a new name and new owners.

A memorial garden was installed by Luna Park in 1995, but its fixtures were lost during the park's 2003 redevelopment. In replacement, a plaque listing those killed was placed on the location of the ride, but a promised mural to surround the plaque was never painted. A separate memorial park was created by [[North Sydney Council]] in 2007, including a sculpture by [[Michael Leunig]].

==Ride==
{{Expand section|size, layout, capacity, and features of the ride|date=April 2010}}
Luna Park's Ghost Train was a [[ghost train (ride)|ghost train]]-style amusement ride. Designed and constructed in 1931 at [[Luna Park Glenelg]], the ride was transported to [[Milsons Point, New South Wales|Milsons Point]] along with all the other rides and reassembled prior to Luna Park Sydney's first opening in October 1935.

==Fire==
On the night of 9 June 1979, a fire broke out inside the ride at approximately 10:15 pm. Due to a combination of low water pressure, under-staffing within the park, and inadequate coverage of the Ghost Train by the park's fire hose system, the fire was able to completely consume the ride.&lt;ref name=Marshall110&gt;{{Cite book|last=Marshall |first=Sam |year=2005 |title=Luna Park - Just for fun |edition=2nd |publisher=Luna Park Sydney Pty Ltd |location=Sydney, Australia |isbn=0-646-44807-2 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SMHmay-26-07-INSIGHT"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Kate |last=McClymont |title=Haunting questions won't go away |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/the-haunting-questions-that-linger/2007/05/25/1179601669141.html |work=Sydney Morning Herald - Weekend Insight |page=13 |date=26 May 2007 |accessdate=7 June 2007}} - Note that the online version differs from print article; different title (''Haunting questions linger'') and first three paragraphs missing.&lt;/ref&gt; It took an hour to bring the fire under control, but it was extinguished before any significant damage could be done to the adjacent River Caves and [[Big Dipper (Luna Park Sydney)|Big Dipper]].&lt;ref name="SMHmay-26-07-INSIGHT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TheAge19790611Birnbauer01"/&gt;

Around 35 people were believed to have been on the ride when thick smoke began to escape from the tunnel doors.&lt;ref name="TheAge19790611Birnbauer01"/&gt; Ride staff raised the alarm, and began to pull people from the ride as their cars exited the tunnel.&lt;ref name="TheAge19790611Birnbauer01"/&gt; It was initially thought that everybody had escaped the fire, but at around 11:30 pm, the bodies of seven people were found inside the ride: John Godson and his two children, Damien and Craig, and four [[Waverley College]] students; Jonathon Billings, Richard Carroll, Michael Johnson, and Seamus Rahilly.&lt;ref name="SMHmay-26-07-INSIGHT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TheAge19790611Birnbauer01"/&gt; At the time of the fire, investigating police speculated that the seven had climbed out of their cars and unsuccessfully tried to find their way out of the tunnel; had they stayed in the cars, they might have survived.&lt;ref name="TheAge19790611Birnbauer01"/&gt; Other evacuated passengers reported seeing empty cars exit the tunnel on fire.&lt;ref name="TheAge19790611Birnbauer02"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Seven die at fun fair: Suddenly fire and smoke make the mock horror real |newspaper=The Age |date=11 June 1979 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ydoQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=x5IDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4980,4921257&amp;dq=luna+park+fire&amp;hl=en |accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
The park was shut down immediately after the incident for a federal investigation.&lt;ref name=Marshall110/&gt;&lt;ref name="TheAge19790611Birnbauer01"/&gt; A [[coroner|coronial]] inquiry into the incident did not determine the cause of the fire, although it was demonstrated that the ride's permanent wiring and attractions were not the source of ignition.&lt;ref name=Marshall110/&gt; Coroner Kevin Anderson found that Luna Park's management had failed to develop an adequate fire suppression program, despite recommendations by [[North Sydney Council]] and the Fire Department eighteen months earlier.&lt;ref name=Marshall110/&gt; Anderson's report stated that while the park's owners and management had failed in their [[duty of care]] towards patrons, the failure was not ''"that high degree of negligence necessary to support a charge of [[criminal negligence]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Marshall |first=Sam |year=2005 |title=Luna Park - Just for fun |edition=2nd |publisher=Luna Park Sydney Pty Ltd |location=Sydney, Australia |isbn=0-646-44807-2 |pages=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NSW Government]] called for new tenders to operate the park on 31 July 1979.&lt;ref name=Marshall111&gt;{{Cite book|last=Marshall |first=Sam |year=2005 |title=Luna Park - Just for fun |edition=2nd |publisher=Luna Park Sydney Pty Ltd |location=Sydney, Australia |isbn=0-646-44807-2 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the fire, a Sydney design consultant stated that he had advised Luna Park management to install a sprinkler system in the Ghost Train in December 1977, following an inspection of the park for potential renovations.&lt;ref name="TheAge19790611Birnbauer01"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Seven die at fun fair: Electrical fault suspected in ghost train fire |newspaper=The Age |first=Bill |last=Birnbauer |date=11 July 1979 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ydoQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=x5IDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4980,4921257&amp;dq=luna+park+fire&amp;hl=en |accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendation was not followed.&lt;ref name=Marshall110/&gt;&lt;ref name="TheAge19790611Birnbauer01"/&gt;

In 1987, a Government inquiry into corruption by the [[National Crime Authority of Australia|National Crime Authority]] reopened the investigation of the fire.&lt;ref name=Spirits42&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Gregory J. Read]] (director) |date=1996 |title=''Spirits of the Carnival - The Quest for Fun'' |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305463/ |medium=Documentary, Videotape |publisher=Paper Bark Films (production), Total Film &amp; Television (distribution) |location=Sydney}} Scene occurring 42:00 to 43:30&lt;/ref&gt; No new evidence was presented, but it was found that the police investigation into the incident had been inadequate, and the coronial inquiry ineffective.&lt;ref name=Spirits42/&gt;

Despite claims ranging from faulty wiring to sabotage in an attempt to have the park closed down and demolished, the cause of the fire has never been established.&lt;ref name=Spirits42/&gt;

===Links to Abe Saffron===
{{See also|Abe Saffron}}
In May 2007, Anne Buckingham, a niece of Sydney underworld figure [[Abe Saffron]], claimed in an interview with ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' that her uncle was responsible for the fire.&lt;ref name="SMHmay-26-07"/&gt; Saffron had been associated with seven other arson attacks in the two years following the Ghost Train fire, although he had repeatedly denied involvement with the Ghost Train fire.&lt;ref name="SMHmay-26-07-INSIGHT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SMHmay-26-07"/&gt; Buckingham claimed the attack was part of a plan for Saffron to gain control of Luna Park's lease, although she stated her belief that the seven deaths were not intended.&lt;ref name="SMHmay-26-07"/&gt;

Former Park Artist [[Martin Sharp]] claimed that Saffron had approached Luna Park's owner, Ted Hopkins, several years before the fire, offering to buy the park.&lt;ref name="SMHmay-26-07-INSIGHT"/&gt; In 1985, it was claimed by NSW [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Michael John Hatton]] that Saffron had [[beneficial ownership]] of the park, resulting in an inquiry which concluded that although people related to Saffron were involved in supplying pinball and arcade games to Luna Park, Abe Saffron himself was not linked to the ownership of the park.&lt;ref name="SMHmay-26-07-INSIGHT"/&gt;

Buckingham later denied she made the comments attributed to her and demanded the story not be published, although the ''Herald'' claims her original statements were recorded on tape during a face-to-face interview.&lt;ref name="SMHmay-26-07"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Kate |last= McClymont |title=Niece links Abe Saffron to Luna Park deaths |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/they-werent-meant-to-die/2007/05/25/1179601666851.html |work=Sydney Morning Herald |pages=1, 13 |date=26 May 2007 |accessdate=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSW [[Attorney General#Australia|Attorney General]] has stated the coronial inquiry could be reopened, but would first require the submission of new evidence to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=[[Australian Associated Press]] |title=Fun park fire inquest could be reopened |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,21825940-1242,00.html?from=public_rss |work=News.com.au |date=31 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416195803/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C23599%2C21825940-1242%2C00.html?from=public_rss |archivedate=16 April 2008 |accessdate=7 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorial==
A memorial was dedicated in 1995 to the seven victims of the 1979 fire, with a tree planted next to an antique bench decorated with the names of the victims.&lt;ref name="SMHjuly-14-03"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Sean |last=Nicholls |title=Ghost Train memorial tree haunts developers |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/13/1058034877881.html |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=13 July 2003 |accessdate=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2003 redevelopment, the tree was removed and the bench lost.&lt;ref name="SMHjuly-14-03"/&gt; Park director Warwick Doughty claimed that the memorial and events had little relevance, although North Sydney mayor Genia McCaffery, among others, disagreed and campaigned for the memorial's reinstatement.&lt;ref name="SMHjuly-14-03"/&gt; In 2004, a plaque listing the names of the victims was placed on an external wall of the [[Luna Park Sydney#Big Top|Big Top]], which was constructed on the site of the Ghost Train.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Marshall |first=Sam |year=2005 |title=Luna Park - Just for fun |edition=2nd |publisher=Luna Park Sydney Pty Ltd |location=Sydney, Australia |isbn=0-646-44807-2 |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SMH29mar04"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Sean |last=Nicholls |title=Tragic day at fun park recalled |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/03/28/1080412238257.html |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=29 March 2004 |accessdate=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaque was to be the centrepiece of a mural painted by former Park Artist [[Martin Sharp]],&lt;ref name="SMH29mar04"/&gt; but this has never been painted. At least one person present at the unveiling of the plaque was unimpressed with the new memorial.&lt;ref name="SMH29mar04"/&gt;

A memorial park was opened at Lavender Bay by North Sydney Council on 25 August 2007.&lt;ref name=mosman/&gt; The ''Art Barton'' Park, named after former Park Artist Arthur Barton, includes a bronze sculpture designed by [[Michael Leunig]] dedicated to the victims.&lt;ref name=mosman&gt;{{Cite news|first=Andre |last=Khoury |title=Memorial honours for victims |url=http://www.mosmandaily.com.au/article/2007/08/29/1296_news.html |work=The Mosman Daily |publisher=Cumberland Newspapers |date=29 August 2007 |accessdate=9 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chapel at Waverley College features a memorial to four of the boys who perished in the fire. The memorial features a photo of each boy along with their names on a plaque.

A complete list of composers who participated in the 60x60 project can be found on the [http://www.VoxNovus.com/60x60/Composers.htm 60x60 website]

The 60x60 project is more than just a single performance.  It is a venue where a large community of composers and sound artists come together to present their music.  Each year after the call for works a Radio Request Extravaganza is held.  This is a radio show where any work submitted to the project may be requested for airplay.  Afterwards, a selection panels finds 60 works for the 60x60 International mix for that year; when 60 composers of a particular region or style are found an alternate mix is created to represent them.  When this happens the project presents the alternate mix as well as the international mix in its concert season.  After the project has presented the audio mixes, usually presented with an analog clock, 60x60 collaborates with an artist in a different media.  A second performance season is held promoting the multimedia collaboration. In conjunction to the performances of the project a CD is made each year to represent the submissions sent to the project.

60x60 has been presented in various types of venues throughout the world from concert halls to classrooms; from contemporary museums to art galleries; from projections on building walls to installations in storefront windows; from large public atriums to bars and nightclubs.  60x60 uses "[[guerrilla]]" production tactics to bring it to the broadest audience possible.

While the music of 60x60 Dance can be from any of the 60x60 mixes, the dancers and choreographers are pooled from the local area where the performance is being held.  This creates a "grassroots" touring show which is community based utilizing the dancers from the immediate region.  60x60 Dance has had performances at churches, performance art spaces, art galleries, dance clubs, theaters, [[The Sheldon]], and the World Financial Center [[Winter Garden Atrium]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://turbulence.org/networked_music_review/2008/11/08/live-stage-60x60-from-arts-world-financial-center-new-york/ Networked Music Review – Live Stage: 60x60 Dance].

==Macro vs Micro==

===Micro===
60x60 is a collection of miniatures or "signature" works from 60 different composers/sound artists.  Each work is 60 seconds (or less) in length and are sequenced in order to fit neatly within each minute of the hour; each new minute is a different piece from a different artist.

&lt;blockquote&gt;60x60 ensures that no individual piece of music lasts too long--you'd be hard pressed to find someone who couldn't sit through one minute of music that didn't appeal to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul W |url=http://fcm07.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-case-for-shorter-pieces.html |title=The case for shorter pieces |publisher=Fcm07.blogspot.com |date=2012-11-13 |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

60x60 creates a unique challenge for the composer/sound artist to express themselves in the concise time frame of one minute.  Besides that one restriction, artists are free and specifically encouraged to express themselves in any way that they wish.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Voisey states, "A minute can be plenty of time to express a whole gamut of imaginative sounds and movements, or it can be a challenge, forcing the artist to isolate what is most important in his/her work." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chattanoogan.com/2013/1/23/242839/UTC-Music-Department-Presents-60x60.aspx |title=UTC Music Department Presents "60x60" Monday - 01/23/2013 |publisher=Chattanoogan.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Macro===
60x60 is much more than a collection of short works played one after another.  The entire hour of 60 on-minute works is specifically curated or composed as a one-hour-long "macro-composition" containing the 60 works.  All 60x60 mixes are put together by artists to create an artistic hour for audiences to enjoy.

&lt;blockquote&gt;60×60 involves macro-composition, which Voisey describes as, "the act of creating a musical work incorporating several fully formed ideas or complete works." And just as "ballet, operas, and movies are all perfect examples of many artists contributing to a greater artistic whole orchestrated by the 'macro-artist'," &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/the-compositional-collective-crowdsourcing-and-collaboration-in-the-digital-age/ ''The Compositional Collective: Crowdsourcing and Collaboration in the Digital Age'' ] By [[Sabrina Peña Young]], [[New Music Box]], September 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the creator and leader of 60x60, [[Robert Voisey]] has created and "macro-composed" the most mixes and is responsible for the "main" annual 60x60 International mix since 2003.  He has put together several other 60x60 mixes including: Pacific Rim mixes, Midwest mixes, 2006 New York Minutes Mix, Munich Mix, Electronic Music Midwest Mix, Evolution Mixes, the UK Mix, the Burgundy Mix, the Magenta Mix, the Sanguine Mix and the Scarlet Mix.

Several other composers have put together different mixes.  [[Eldad Tsabary]] has been responsible for putting together the Canadian Mixes as well as the Vermillion mix and the Order of Magnitude Mix.  [[Aaron Krister Johnson]] was responsible for the UnTwelve Mix and the Crimson Mix.  [[Sabina Pena Young]] was responsible for putting together the Athena mix.  [[Robert Ratcliffe]] for the Presenters Mix.  [[Melissa Grey]] for the 2012 New York Minutes Mix. [[James Finnerty]] for the 2012 Canadian Mix. [[Thomas Gerwin]] for the 2012 Voice Mix.

==Past, present and future==
There is a history of electroacoustic "shorts."  In 1982, [[Elliott Sharp]] created an album of shorts called "State of the Union" to accompany an issue of Zone Magazine.&lt;ref name="newmusicbox"&gt;[http://www.newmusicbox.org/page.nmbx?id=61tp00 "Got a Minute? A Few Words on Music in 60 Seconds or Less"] -[[Robert Voisey]] with additional reporting, Frank J. Oteri, "[[NewMusicBox]]" May 1, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1980s when the Association pour la création et recherches en électroacoustique de Québec (Acreq) launched an annual competition for "Electroclips", most pieces being between one and three minutes in duration. In the late 1980s, [[Jean-François Denis]] and [[Claude Schryer]] of Montreal, commissioned 25 three-minute pieces for the "25 instantanés électroacoustiques", Électro Clips, published by empreinted DIGITALes in 1990, IMED 9004.  In 1998, [[Larry Polansky]] created "The Frog Peak Collaborations Project" a double album of shorts based on an audio sound file from [[Chris Mann (composer)|Chris Mann]].&lt;ref name="newmusicbox"/&gt;

In the tradition of projects before it 60x60 has inspired several electroacoustic miniature projects such as [[David Morneau]]'s 60x365, where he blogged a 60-second composition once every day for a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://60x365.com/labels/collage.html |title=daily new music |publisher=60x365 |date= |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://WWW.5of4.com/about.html |title=&amp;#124;&amp;#124; David Morneau &amp;#124;&amp;#124; 5 of 4 Music &amp;#124;&amp;#124; |publisher=Www.5of4.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ovguide.com/david-morneau-9202a8c04000641f8000000008bdef96# |title=David Morneau Video &amp;#124; Interviews |publisher=Ovguide.com |date=1975-05-02 |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And the miniature form continues in many other projects such as [[Jon Nelson (artist)|Jon Nelson]]'s 50/50 project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.some-assembly-required.net/5050/ |title=About |publisher=Some Assembly Required |date= |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blog.some-assembly-required.net/2009/01/5050-call-for-artists.html |title=Some Assembly Required: 50/50: Call For Artists |publisher=Blog.some-assembly-required.net |date=2009-01-25 |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''65803 Didymos''', provisional designation {{mp|1996 GT}}, is a sub-kilometer [[asteroid]] and synchronous [[Binary asteroid|binary system]], classified as [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] and [[near-Earth object]] of both the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo]] and [[Amor asteroid|Amor group]]. It is the target of the proposed ''[[AIDA (mission)|AIDA]]'' asteroid-mission. The asteroid was discovered in 1996, by the [[Spacewatch]] survey at [[Kitt Peak National Observatory|Kitt Peak]], and its small 170-meter [[minor-planet moon]] was discovered in 2003. Due to its binary nature, it was then [[Asteroid#Naming|named]] "Didymos", the Greek word for [[twin]].

== Discovery ==

''Didymos'' was discovered on 11 April 1996, by the University of Arizona [[Steward Observatory]]'s [[Spacewatch]] survey using its 0.9-meter telescope at [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] in Arizona, United States.&lt;ref name="MPC-Didymos" /&gt; The binary nature of the asteroid was discovered by others; suspicions of binarity first arose in [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] delay-[[Doppler radar|Doppler]] echoes, and these were confirmed with an optical [[lightcurve]] analysis, along with [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo]] radar imaging on 23 November 2003.

== Orbital characteristics ==

''Didymos'' orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.0–2.3&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 2 years and 1 month (770 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.38 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 3[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; Its approach to Earth in November 2003, was especially close with a distance of 7.18 million&amp;nbsp;km; it will not come that near until November 2123, with a distance of 5.9 million&amp;nbsp;km. It also passes very close to Mars: 4.69 million&amp;nbsp;km in 2144.

== Physical characteristics ==

In the [[SMASS classification]], ''Didymos'' is an Xk-type asteroid, which transitions from the [[X-type asteroid|X-type]] to the rare [[K-type asteroid]]s.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; It [[rotation period|rotates]] rapidly, with a period of 2.26 hours and a brightness variation of 0.08 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=3/3]]}}), which indicates that the body has a nearly spheroidal shape.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pravec-2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pravec-2003c" /&gt;

=== Satellite ===

''Didymos'' is a [[binary asteroid]] with a satellite in its orbit. The [[minor-planet moon]], provisionally designated {{mp|S/2003 (65803) 1}}, has an [[orbital period]] of 11.9 hours.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;{{efn|name=lightcurve-plot-PDO}} It measures approximately {{val|0.17|0.03}} kilometers in diameter compared to {{val|0.75|0.1}} kilometers for its primary (a mean-diameter-ratio of 0.22).&lt;ref name="johnstonsarchive" /&gt; It has been informally named "Didymoon".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://phys.org/news/2015-06-telescopes-focus-esa-asteroid-mission.html Telescopes focus on target of ESA's asteroid mission]" at phys.org (30 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was named "Didymos", Greek for "twin", due to its binary nature.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The name was suggested by the discoverer, University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Lab astronomer Joseph L. "Joe" Montani, who made the naming proposal to the International Astronomical Union after the binary nature of the object was detected. The approved naming citation was published on 13 July 2004 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 52326}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt; The moon's nickname, "Didymoon", remains unofficial.

== Proposed exploration ==

''Didymos'' was the target of the proposed unmanned [[AIDA (mission)|Asteroid Impact &amp; Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission]], a cancelled collaboration between [[European Space Agency|ESA]] and [[NASA]].&lt;ref name="AIDA-PDF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AIDA-mission" /&gt;  After the cancellation, NASA announced it would proceed with the impactor portion of the mission, called [[Double Asteroid Redirection Test|''DART'']]. The NASA mission is intended to test whether a spacecraft impact could successfully deflect an asteroid on a collision course with Earth. ''DART'' will be the first spacecraft to intentionally target an asteroid known to have a [[minor-planet moon]] ([[243&amp;nbsp;Ida]] was visited by the [[Galileo spacecraft]] but its moon was a surprise). ''Didymos'' is the most easily reachable asteroid of its size from Earth, requiring a [[delta-v|delta-''v'']] of only 5.1&amp;nbsp;km/s for a spacecraft to rendezvous, compared to 6.0&amp;nbsp;km/s to reach the [[Moon]].&lt;ref name="JPL-delta-v"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2010 | url = http://echo.jpl.nasa.gov/~lance/delta_v/delta_v.rendezvous.html | title = Delta-v for spacecraft rendezvous with all known near-Earth asteroids | accessdate = 2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''DART'' will be launched in December of 2020 for an impact in October 2022.&lt;ref name="NASA-planetaryDefense-DART"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2018 | url = https://www.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/dart | title = Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) Mission | accessdate = 2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ANTI – Contemporary Art Festival'''  presents site-specific [[contemporary art]] covering all artistic forms from [[sculpture]] and [[environmental art]] to dance, [[live art]] and [[performance]]. The yearly festival is held in [[Kuopio]], [[Finland]]. The first ANTI Festival was organised in 2002 by The Arts Council of [[Northern Savonia]]. The ANTI – Contemporary Art Festival Association was established in 2005 to coordinate the festival.

With an emphasis on performance, ANTI has established itself as Finland’s foremost presenter of live art while also showcasing new developments in [[Sonic art|sonic]] and [[visual art]]s. Site-specific and time based works take place in public spaces, on streets, in office buildings, parks, shopping-centres and other privately owned sites, depending on the festival’s theme and the nature of the works. The festival programme consists of artworks created by invited artists and artists selected by an open proposal process.

ANTI means ”gift” in Finnish. Therefore, it is very appropriate that the artworks which are presented are free of charge. There is a small fee only for the seminars, artists’ talks and workshops. The ANTI Festival wants to make art more accessible for everybody. People who usually don’t gravitate towards art may become participant viewers of artworks by chance.

24.9.2013 ANTI – Contemporary Art Festival launched a new international art award ANTI Festival International Prize for Live Art which was awarded for the first time in 2014.

==Themes==

'''2003'''

In year 2002 works were presented for example in a [[hair salon]], a [[gas station]] and in a [[nursing home]]. Main artists of the festival were butch artist Saga Kobayashi from Japan and Live Art artists Eve Dent and [[Kira O'Reilly]] from [[England]].

'''2004'''

International programme included artists from many countries such as [[Great Britain]], Canada, [[United States of America]], Germany, Japan and [[Netherlands]]. During four days there were 17 performances. One of them was Will Kwan's (CA) performative lecture in [[University of Kuopio]] which was mentioned in media as well as [[Jennifer Nelson (artist)|Jennifer Nelson]]'s (US) and Glen Redpath's (CA) work The Race. The Race was held in local super market where it brought running competition and consuming hysteria of Friday afternoon together.

'''2005'''

Theme of the year was time. The theme was crystallized by [[Charles Landry]] who said: ”It is important that a city does not wipe out its memory”.

'''2006'''

Some place might make you laugh. Some place will make you think. Somewhere you will not find art at all. You will walk through the city with a headset on. You will breath the same air with the artist. Somewhere you perhaps will feel strange pleasure. You will not even dare to enter somewhere. Somewhere you might get shocked. You may discover a slight disorder.

There were 17 artists from all over the world giving their performances in Kuopio City Hall, Väinölänniemi Tennis Court, Youth Center 44, Hotel Puijonsarvi, Huuhanmäki Observatory, Cinema Maxim, an empty property on Tasavallankatu, balcony of the Carlson department store, [[Kuopio Airport|Kuopio airport]], [[Savonia University of Applied Sciences]], Health Professions Kuopio, an apartment mediated by the real estate agency Huoneistokeskus and the office of Reijo Kela.

'''2007'''

For the 2007 edition of the festival a community college, a [[skateboarding]] park, the pages of a city newspaper, a late-night grill, a children’s playground and an entire island were negotiated by an international program of artists. One of the most attractive works of the year was the vacuum cleaner’s One Hundred Thousand Pieces of Possibility where the artist gave away 1000 euros in 1 cent pieces. Claire Blundell Jones’s work Introducing Tumbleweed to the Finnish Landscape was also well noticed in media.

'''2008'''

For ANTI 2008 Kuopio's residents opened their homes to audiences and host works made for domestic space. Other projects took place in a sports stadium, on a public stage, across the network of city streets and on, and under, the [[Rönö]] bridge.

'''2009'''

In year 2009 the theme of ANTI was walking. For example, Vincent Chevalier (CA) traveled from one place to another walking along a 2-metre length of red carpet by which he gave himself The Red Carpet Treatment. Tim Knowles (UK) in term set off walking and were guided solely by the wind. For this piece he had created a wind vane mounted to a helmet.

'''2010'''

This edition of ANTI concentrated on how artists working with writing and language navigate, read and inhabit the city.

'''2011'''

2011 was year of celebration since it was 10th ANTI Festival. There were pieces presented by artists from [[Great Britain]], United States, Canada, Belgium and France. In the programme there was for example Blast Theory’s Rider Spoke which was a work for cyclists who explored the city by bike, looked for places to hide recorded messages and found digital treasures others have hidden, the choir conducted by Heidi Fast and a balloon piece by Gaëtan Rusquet. The festival culminated with Mammalian Diving Reflex’s The Children’s Choice Awards where the only opinions that mattered were those of the kids.

'''2012'''

This year the ANTI – Contemporary Art Festival programme worked on the themes of man's relationship with nature and the connection between sexuality and the body as well as the natural state of the human body. The festival took  over public spaces in Kuopio for the 11th time. And not just in the town — the Luonnon ANTI programme set up camp on the island of Karhunsaari as well. A weekend-long artwork and workshop programme were planned especially with children in mind.

'''2013'''

As usual, the ANTI Festival offered unexpected encounters in Kuopio and [[Northern Savonia]]. In this, its twelfth year, the international festival of contemporary art spread to other locations too, such as [[Lapinlahti]], Hietasalo island and the [[smoke sauna]] in Rauhalahti. In Cruising for Art about 20 Finnish and international artists made over 800 1-to-1 performances around Kuopio. Also the first PechaKucha night in Kuopio was organized during the festival.

'''2014'''

Children and teenagers were in the focus of this year's ANTI – Contemporary Art Festival. The international festival programme consisted of work where the youngest family members or youngsters nearing adulthood were either the theme or an active part of the production. This year the first ever ANTI Festival International Prize for Live Art was awarded. Winner of the first prize was Canadian artist [[Heather Cassils]].

==Recent events==
Artistic Directors Mrs. Johanna Tuukkanen and Mr. Erkki Soininen of the ANTI -festival received a Finnish State Prize for the Arts on November 16, 2006.

The '''Academy of Music''', also known as '''American Academy of Music''', is a concert hall and opera house located at 240 S. [[Broad Street (Philadelphia)|Broad Street]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Its location is between Locust and Manning Streets in the [[Avenue of the Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Avenue of the Arts]] area of [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]].

The hall was built in 1855–57 and is the oldest opera house in the [[United States]] that is still used for its original purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Di Nardo, "Happy birthday: Academy of Music to celebrate 150 lavish years." ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' (January 24, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the "Grand Old Lady of Locust Street," the venue is the home of the [[Pennsylvania Ballet]] and [[Opera Philadelphia]]. It was also home to the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] from its inception in 1900 until 2001, when the orchestra moved to the new [[Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts]]. The Philadelphia Orchestra still retains ownership of the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.philly.com/2007-01-26/news/25221486_1_opera-house-philadelphia-orchestra-concert-hall |title=A stalwart hall that does it all |work=The Philadelphia Inquirer |author=Peter Dobrin |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hall was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;Charles E. Shedd, Jr., et al. (December 1979) {{NHLS url|id=66000674|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: American Academy of Music; Academy of Music}}, National Park Service and {{NHLS url|id=66000674|title=''Accompanying one photo, exterior, undated''|photos=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:American Academy of Music 1856.jpg|left|thumb|Share of the American Academy of Music, issued 15. October 1856]]
The Academy of Music held an inaugural [[Ball (dance party)|ball]] on January 26, 1857. At the time ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the theater as "magnificently gorgeous, brilliantly lighted, solidly constructed, finely located, beautifully ornamented" but went on to lament "all that lacks is a few singers to render it 'the thing'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1857/01/30/77069900.html?pageNumber=4|title=Article 8 -- No Title|page=4|date=January 30, 1857|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre had its first opera production, and what was billed as its formal opening, a month later on February 25, 1857, with a performance by the [[Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company]] of Verdi's ''[[Il trovatore]]'' starring [[Marietta Gazzaniga]] as Leonora, [[Alessandro Amodio]] as Count di Luna, [[Zoë Aldini]] as Azucena, [[Pasquale Brignoli]] as Manrico, and [[Max Maretzek]] conducting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1857/02/26/archives/the-philadelphia-academy-of-music.html|title=The Philadelphia Academy of Music.|date=March 26, 1857|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maretzek, who was already presenting operas at the [[Academy of Music (New York City)|Academy of Music in New York City]] and at the [[Chestnut Street Theatre]] in Philadelphia since 1850, brought his company back annually to the Academy of Music in Philadelphia through 1873. Due to his association with both the Philadelphia and New York City Academy of Music venues, his company was sometimes referred to as the Academy of Music Opera Company.

The Academy has been in continuous use since 1857, hosting many world-famous performers, conductors and composers, and a significant number of American premieres of works in the standard operatic and classical repertoire. Noted operas that had their American premieres there include Strauss's ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'', [[Charles Gounod|Gounod's]] ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]''. In 1916, [[Leopold Stokowski]] conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra in the American premiere of Mahler's [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Eighth Symphony]] (the ''Symphony of a Thousand'').

The list of artists who have performed at the Academy of Music, from the 20th century, includes such figures as [[Marian Anderson]],  [[Maria Callas]], [[Enrico Caruso]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Vladimir Horowitz]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Anna Pavlova]], [[Edith Piaf]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Tony Bennett]] (in 1962), [[Itzhak Perlman]], [[Leontyne Price]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Artur Rubinstein]], [[Isaac Stern]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Joan Sutherland]], and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], among many others. After the Philadelphia Orchestra moved to the Kimmel Center, the 21st century brought more non-classical artists to the Academy, among them [[Noel Gallagher]] who appeared there in 2011.

Outside of arts events, it hosted various public meetings including the 1872 [[Republican National Convention]].  Possibly America's first indoor football game took place here in 1889 between the University of Pennsylvania and a club from Princeton resulting in a 0-0 tie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.kimmelcenter.org/post/153432702159/its-football-sunday-once-again-did-you-know-the Kimmel Center website]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, parts of [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 1993 film ''[[The Age of Innocence (1993 film)|The Age of Innocence]]'' were filmed in the Academy.  Despite its name, the Academy has never contained a music school.  Various voice and instrumental competitions have taken place there, including the Pavarotti competition.

==Design==
[[File:Interior-Philadelphia Academy of Music.jpg|thumb|left|200 px| Interior, Philadelphia Academy of Music]]
An architectural competition for the Academy's design was announced in October 1854 and was won by the Philadelphia firm of [[Napoleon LeBrun]] and Gustavus Runge. A style of architecture that originated in Runge's native Germany now known as [[Rundbogenstil]] ("round arch style") was used for the exterior here and in a number of American buildings of the Civil War Era. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on June 18, 1855, with President [[Franklin Pierce]] in attendance and the venue opened with a grand ball on January 26, 1857.  The first opera performed there was the [[Western Hemisphere]] premiere of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Il Trovatore]]'', on February 25 of the same year.

In order to reserve as much of the budget for the interior as possible, the architects designed a relatively plain brick and brownstone exterior that could be clad in marble if funds became available later. The ornate auditorium has an "open horseshoe" shape and proscenium columns with elliptical cross-sections in order to provide more direct sight lines from the seats in the side balconies. The auditorium is enclosed by a solid three-foot brick wall with studding and pine boards lining the inner sides to prevent echoes and absorb sound. The upper balconies are recessed in a tiered fashion and supported by 14 Corinthian columns. An unusual feature was that the boxes were originally placed against the rear wall on the second and third levels (Balcony and Family Circle). They were divided from each other by walls that curved down from the ceilings. These have since been removed and boxes created elsewhere. The front of the first balcony is highly ornamented. The hall currently has a seating capacity of 2,389 which can be expanded to 2,509 when seats are placed in the orchestra pit and proscenium boxes. An 1860 account by Runge mentioned that the full auditorium, then nearly 3,000 persons, could be emptied in four minutes in "great calmness and order" owing to the wide corridors and stairways.

===Interior===
[[File:Philadelpia Academy of Music.jpg|thumb|Chandelier and murals]]
[[File:Academy of Music Proscenium (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Proscenium wall and boxes. Architectural ornament by Charles Bushor and [[Joseph A. Bailly]]]]
[[File:Mozart-Philadeplhia Academy of Music.jpg|thumb|Bust of Mozart with figures of Poetry and Music]]
The auditorium is graced by a large crystal chandelier, which measures {{convert|16|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter,   and weighs {{convert|5000|lb|abbr=on}}. When installed, the chandelier contained 240 gas jets, which were converted to electricity in 1900, and rewired in 1957.  That same year, it was fitted with an electric-powered winch.  It previously required 12 people working four-hours to lower it by hand.  The fixture was restored to its original form and missing crystals replaced in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.philorch.org/pdfs/AOMchandeliertimeline.pdf Philadelphia Orchestra, "Crystal Chandelier"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The heat produced by the original gas fixtures helped to ventilate the hall by causing air to rise to various vents along the back walls and in the center of the ceiling.

Atop the proscenium is a [[bas-relief]] bust of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].  Seated on the [[cornice]] above are the figures of Poetry, on the left, and Music, on the right. The elaborate carvings and gilded wood sculpture decorations throughout the auditorium are the work of Charles Bushor and [[Joseph A. Bailly]] and the ceiling murals of allegorical figures were completed by Karl Hermann Schmolze.

The original stage curtain was of crimson fabric with heavy golden fringe, ropes, tassels, etc. by J. R. Martin of Berlin.  A secondary curtain had a scene of Lake Como, Italy, painted by Russell Smith of Philadelphia.

The original seating on the Parquet and first balcony had arms and upholstery with springs and a covering of dark red plush fabric.  The second balcony had "sofas without arms" and the third, pew-like seating. These were mostly replaced with more typical theater seating. The installation of more spacious seating began in 2018.

A 2007 donation of [[United States dollar|$]]5.3 million by Leonore Annenberg was designated for restoration of the Academy's ballroom.&lt;ref name="pledge"&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Dobrin|title=Academy ballroom gets major pledge|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/peter_dobrin/20070123_Academy_ballroom_gets_major_pledge_.html|date=23 January 2007|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|publisher=philly.com|accessdate=2012-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was part of the almost $12 million (USD) in donations raised at the 150th anniversary concert for the Academy of Music.&lt;ref name="treasure"&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Dobrin|title=Ways to show we treasure our Academy |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/peter_dobrin/20070201_Ways_to_show_we_treasure_our_Academy_.html|date=1 February 2007|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|publisher=philly.com|accessdate=2012-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acoustics===
For many decades, Philadelphia regarded the Academy as having excellent acoustics that were wrongly attributed to a circular brick chamber under the floor of the auditorium.&lt;ref name="Christopher N. Brooks 2002 p. 60"&gt;Christopher N. Brooks, ''Architectural Acoustics'' (2002), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=vimSCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=acoustics+myths+academy+of+music&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8NVosW2f5Z&amp;sig=d4JhbCl03N_Pfq4iXCWWGs40ZTM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFy5fsg4XXAhUm94MKHccPDRsQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=acoustics%20myths%20academy%20of%20music&amp;f=false] It was intended by the architects that sound penetrating the "elastic floor" would reverberate in this chamber and emerge into the auditorium.&lt;ref&gt;G. Runge, Das neue Opernhaus „Academy of music" in Philadelphia, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; [https://digital.zlb.de/viewer/image/15239363_1860_03/4/]  Unfortunately, this device was ineffective as little sound could pass through the floor in either direction.  The ceiling of the auditorium was deliberately designed not to be a sound reflector for fear of echoes.

Some have found the Academy's sound problematic for orchestra:

"The Academy of Music in Philadelphia is a beautiful, historic, charming building with wholly unsuitable acoustics for orchestra...The dry, unreverberant acoustics results from the roughly 2,900 audience members, who completely surround the volume of the auditorium, soaking up sound as they sit."&lt;ref name="Christopher N. Brooks 2002 p. 60"/&gt;

The Academy was built as an opera house which typically has a lower reverberation than a concert hall, the venue's primary use for many years. The reverberation time has been measured at 1.4 seconds compared to 1.2 at La Scala, Milan, and 1.75 at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', "Acoustics still playing it by ear" (Nov. 22, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the "Philadelphia Sound" of the Philadelphia Orchestra was, at least in part, the result of long-term efforts by Stokowski, later sustained by [[Eugene Ormandy]], to compensate for this weakness.&lt;ref name="cutting"&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Dobrin|title=When the music was cutting-edge|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer |publisher=philly.com|date=26 January 2007|url=http://articles.philly.com/2007-01-26/news/25221392_1_philadelphia-orchestra-academy-leaders-henri-vieuxtemps |accessdate=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some remodeling in the mid-1950s, Ormandy refused to make recordings with the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] in the Academy.  [[Riccardo Muti]], Ormandy's successor, also made his commercial recordings with the orchestra elsewhere.

Various conductors have commented on the quality of the orchestral sound in the hall, as collected by [[Leo Beranek|Leo L. Beranek]] in his book ''Music, Acoustics &amp; Architecture'':
* [[Fritz Reiner]] commented: "The Academy has very good acoustics although somewhat dry. It is like an Italian opera house."
* [[Pierre Monteux]]: "This hall is too dry; the tone stops instantly. The sound should have a more flattering carry-over."
* [[Herbert von Karajan]]: "There is good orchestral balance, but the sound is too small. One doesn't get full power from the climaxes."'&lt;ref name="cutting"/&gt;

Extensive renovations beginning in 1994 have maintained the building's architecture and made acoustic improvements. Although many programs at the hall are amplified and the Academy is no longer home to the Philadelphia Orchestra, the opera, ballet and other classical concerts still rely on the hall's native acoustics.

The '''Adelaide Film Festival''' (ADLFF) is an international film festival held over two weeks in mid October, in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. The ADLFF has a strong focus on local South Australian and Australian produced content, with the [[Adelaide Film Festival Investment Fund]] (AFFIF) established to fund investment in Australian films, of $1,000,000 per festival.

==History==
First established in May 2002, by [[Premiers of South Australia|South Australian Premier]] Hon. [[Mike Rann]] to stimulate the local film industry and celebrate the 30th anniversary of the [[South Australian Film Corporation]], the festival showcases and explores contemporary screen culture with a program of screenings, special events and forum sessions.

The inaugural Adelaide Film Festival was held between 28 February to 3 March 2003. After 150 screenings, the festival was met with both critical acclaim and popular support, with a third of the ninety ticketed screenings sold out.

An earlier independently-financed Adelaide International Film Festival had been held from 1959 to 1980.&lt;ref name="AIFF"&gt;[http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=390&amp;c=3355 State Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401031043/http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=390&amp;c=3355 |date=1 April 2015 }} (12 November 2007) ''Adelaide International Film Festival''.

== The Jim Bettison and Helen James Award ==
The Jim Bettison and Helen James Award has been established to recognise that many Australians have contributed exemplary and inspiring lifelong work of high achievement and benefit, and that the completion, extension, recording and/or dissemination of such work would have benefits for both the individual concerned and for the wider Australian community.

On an annual basis, it is hoped that the Award, which is provided in recognition of achievement, will provide the beneficiary with further time for activity that may continue to inspire, enrich and be of benefit to the community. Each year, the Award will give $50,000 to a recipient who has contributed significantly in his or her area of expertise – which might include, among others, the arts and humanities, social justice, the environment or the sciences.

2017: '''Robert McFarlane''', leading Australian social documentary and arts photographer

2016: In 2016 two bold and innovative individuals were honoured.

* '''Meryl Tankard,''' one of Australia’s pre-eminent dancers, choreographers and directors

2015 '''Greg Mackie OAM,''' founder of the iconic South Australian thought leadership event, Adelaide Festival of Ideas.

== Indigenous Feature Documentary Initiative ==
In partnership with Screen Australia, KOJO and the National Film and Sound Archive, this initiative is the first of its kind. It supports innovative, observational and/or social justice docs, with up $738,000 in funding.

Together the partners allow an established Indigenous filmmaker to create a feature-length documentary.

In 2017, ADL Film Fest World Premiered the resulting film - Larissa Behrendt’s '''AFTER THE APOLOGY'''

The film focuses on a group of grandmothers taking on the system over the increase in Indigenous child removal in the years following Kevin Rudd’s apology to the “Stolen Generations”.

'''''Lemar-Aftaab''''' is an [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] independent weekly magazine that focuses on the culture and politics of Afghanistan.  Compared to other publications in the country, ''Aftaab'' has a secular bent and has drawn criticism from conservative [[Islam]]ic scholars.

In June 2003, the magazine was [[censorship|banned]] by the Afghan government because several articles on Islam were deemed to be [[sacrilege|sacrilegious]].  The editor of the magazine, [[Mir Hussein Mehdavi]], was arrested by the authorities and charged with blasphemy.  He was later ordered to be released but may still stand trial.

'''Anderson Ruffin Abbott''' (7 April 1837 &amp;ndash; 29 December 1913)  was the first Canadian-born [[Black Canadian]] to be a licensed [[physician|as a family physician]]. His career included participation in the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name="dcbo"&gt;[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=7166 Biography at the ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afro"&gt;[http://php.ams-inc.on.ca/?q=publications/canadian_medical_lives/anderson_ruffin_abbot Anderson Ruffin Abbott: First Afro-Canadian Doctor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053409/http://php.ams-inc.on.ca/?q=publications%2Fcanadian_medical_lives%2Fanderson_ruffin_abbot |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant roles included coroner of [[Kent County, Ontario]] and surgeon-in-chief.

==Early life==
Anderson Abbott was born in [[Toronto]] to [[Wilson Ruffin Abbott|Wilson Ruffin]] and Ellen Toyer Abbott.  The Abbotts were a prominent [[Black Canadians|black]] family in Toronto, who had left [[Alabama]] &amp;ndash; as [[free people of color]] &amp;ndash; after their store had been [[looting|ransacked]].&lt;ref name="uot"&gt;[http://www.greatpast.utoronto.ca/GreatMinds/ShowBanner.asp?ID=17 University of Toronto Biography of Abbott]&lt;/ref&gt;  After first living a short time in [[New York (state)|New York]], they settled in [[Upper Canada]] in 1835 or 1836.  Wilson Abbott soon began to purchase [[real estate]], in and around Toronto, where he owned 48 properties by 1871.  The senior Abbott also became active in politics.&lt;ref name="dcbo"/&gt;

The family's prosperity allowed Anderson Abbott to receive an excellent education.  He attended both private and public schools, including [[William King (abolitionist)|William King]]'s school, in the black [[Buxton National Historic Site and Museum|Elgin settlement]] (now [[North Buxton]], Ontario).  He was an [[honour student]] at the Toronto Academy and later attended [[Oberlin College]] in [[Ohio]].  He returned to Canada and in 1857, entered University College in Toronto and in 1858, became a medical student at the [[University of Toronto|Toronto School of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chathamdailynews.ca/2017/02/03/chatham-doctor-was-honoured-internationally&lt;/ref&gt; He studied under [[Alexander Thomas Augusta]], a black physician who was born in the U.S. Although he did not graduate,&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=bi9nAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA254&amp;dq=Anderson+Ruffin+Abbott+did+not+graduate&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHytvyo57ZAhVI7GMKHTXMBdEQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Anderson%20Ruffin%20Abbott%20did%20not%20graduate&amp;f=false, page =254,item=47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="biographi.ca"&gt;http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/abbott_anderson_ruffin_14E.html&lt;/ref&gt; Abbott received a license to practice from the Medical Board of [[Upper Canada]], in 1861, thus becoming the first Canadian-born, black physician.&lt;ref name="dcbo"/&gt;

==American Civil War==
{{Main|Canada in the American Civil War}}

Anderson Abbott applied for a commission as an assistant [[surgeon]], in the [[Union Army]], in February 1863.  His offer was not accepted, so in April he applied to be a "medical cadet" in the [[United States Colored Troops]], before finally entering service as a civilian surgeon under contract.  He served in [[Washington, D.C.]], from June 1863 to August 1865, starting at the recently opened [[Freedmen's Hospital]] (or Contraband Hospital) before moving to a hospital in Arlington, Virginia. While in the army, he achieved the rank of lieutenant-colonel.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=TIc6AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT118&amp;dq=Anderson+Ruffin+Abbott&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjX-IHjoZ7ZAhUP72MKHblgDsMQ6AEISjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Anderson%20Ruffin%20Abbott&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

One of only thirteen black surgeons to serve in the American Civil War, Abbott received numerous commendations and became popular in Washington society. This fostered a friendly relationship between Abbott and [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]].&lt;ref name="uot"/&gt;  On the night of Lincoln's assassination, Abbott accompanied Elizabeth Keckley to attend the stricken president at [[Petersen House]].  After Lincoln's death, Mary Todd Lincoln presented Abbott with the plaid shawl that Lincoln had worn to [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|his 1861 inauguration]].&lt;ref name="dcbo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="afro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uot"/&gt;

==Post-war career==
In 1866, Abbott resigned from service to the Union Army and returned to Canada.  He attended primary medical classes at the [[University of Toronto]] the following year.  While he did not graduate, he established a medical practice and was admitted to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario in 1871.  In an [[Anglican]] [[wedding ceremony]] in Toronto on 9 August 1871, he married Mary Ann Casey, the 18-year-old daughter of a successful black barber.  Abbott and his wife moved to Chatham where he resumed his medical practice.  They eventually had three daughters and two sons.&lt;ref name="dcbo"/&gt;

Like his father, Abbott soon became an important member of the black community in Toronto.  From 1873 to 1880, he fought against [[racially segregated]] schools as president of the Wilberforce Educational Institute and was appointed [[coroner]] for [[Kent County, Ontario]] in 1874,&lt;ref name="dcbo"/&gt; the first Black man to hold that office.&lt;ref name="uot"/&gt;  Abbott contributed to  a local newspaper, the ''Chatham Planet'', and was associate editor of the ''[[Missionary Messenger]]'', the journal of the local [[British Methodist Episcopal Church]].  Abbott was made president of both the Chatham Literary and Debating Society and the Chatham Medical Society in 1878.&lt;ref name="dcbo"/&gt;  Abbott moved his medical practice to [[Dundas, Ontario]] in 1881 where he also served in some important community roles including trustee of that community's high school and chairman of the town's internal management committee  from 1885 to 1889.&lt;ref name="dcbo"/&gt;  He also worked as an administrator for the Dundas Mechanics' Institute.&lt;ref name="afro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="biographi.ca"/&gt;

The family moved to Oakville, Ontario in 1889 but returned to Toronto the following year.  He was elected a member of the local post of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] and one of 273 Civil War veterans in Toronto to wear the badge of that fraternity.  He was then known as "Captain Abbott", a [[military rank|rank]] which might reflect his office within the Grand Army of the Republic rather than his actual rank during the American Civil War. In November 1892, Abbott was appointed [[aide-de-camp]] on the Staff of the Commanding Officers Dept. of New York. A source of great pride for Abbott and his family, this was the highest military honour ever bestowed on a black person in Canada or the United States.&lt;ref name="dcbo"/&gt;

In 1894, Abbott was appointed surgeon-in-chief at [[Provident Hospital (Chicago)|Provident Hospital]] in [[Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;https://medicine.utoronto.ca/u-t-medicine-celebrates-its-trailblazers&lt;/ref&gt; the first training hospital for black nurses in the United States.  He became the hospital's medical superintendent In 1896 but resigned the following year.  Returning to Toronto, Abbott resumed his private practice and became more involved with writing for various publications including the ''[[Colored American Magazine]]'' of [[Boston]] and [[New York City|New York]], the ''[[Anglo-American Magazine]]'' of [[London]]  (for which he wrote "Some recollections of Lincoln's assassination"), and ''[[New York Age]]''.  Medicine, [[African-American history|Black history]], the Civil War, [[Darwinism]], [[biology]], and [[poetry]] were among his topics.&lt;ref name="dcbo"/&gt;

==Later life==
At the [[Fin de siècle|turn of the century]] he became embroiled in the debate between [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and [[Booker T. Washington]] over [[social change]].  Siding with Du Bois, Abbott believed that Black access to higher education was essential and should not be compromised.  Believing that blacks would be [[cultural assimilation|culturally assimilated]], Abbott wrote: "It is just as natural for two races living together on the same soil to blend as it is for the waters of two river tributaries to mingle."  With Canada's black population on the decline, he thought this was especially true in his own country and wrote "by the process of absorption and expatriation the color line will eventually fade out in Canada."&lt;ref name="dcbo"/&gt;

==Death==
Anderson Ruffin Abbott died in 1913, at the age of 76, in the Toronto home of his son-in-law, [[Frederick Langdon Hubbard]], ([[Toronto Transportation Commission]] Chairman from 1929 to 1930, and son of his long-time friend [[William Peyton Hubbard]]).&lt;ref name="dcbo"/&gt;  He is buried in the [[Toronto Necropolis]].&lt;ref name="afro"/&gt;

'''Ask.com''' (originally known as '''Ask Jeeves''') is a [[question answering]]-focused [[e-business]] founded in 1996 by [[Garrett Gruener]] and [[David Warthen]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]].

The original software was implemented by [[Gary Chevsky]] from his own design. Warthen, Chevsky, Justin Grant, and others built the early AskJeeves.com website around that core engine. In late 2010, facing insurmountable competition from more popular search engines, the company outsourced its web search technology and returned to its roots as a [[question and answer site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/technology/internet/10ask.html?src=busln | work=The New York Times | first=Verne G. | last=Kopytoff | title=Ask.com Giving Up Search to Return to Q-and-A Service | date=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglas Leeds]] was elevated from president to CEO in 2010.&lt;ref name="IAC Management Bios"&gt;{{cite web|title=IAC Management |url=http://iac.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=20&amp;item=2491 |work=IAC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105004656/http://iac.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=20&amp;item=2491 |archivedate=January 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ask.com has been criticized for its [[browser toolbar]], which has been accused of behaving like [[malware]] due to its [[Potentially unwanted program|bundling with other software]] and the difficulty of its uninstallation.

Three venture capital firms, [[Highland Capital Partners]], [[Institutional Venture Partners]], and The RODA Group were early investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1054298/0000950149-99-001225.txt |title=Ask Jeeves, Inc. initial public offering prospectus |accessdate=July 12, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629100701/http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1054298/0000950149-99-001225.txt| archivedate= June 29, 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ask.com is currently owned by [[IAC (company)|InterActiveCorp]] (IAC) under the [[NASDAQ]] symbol {{NASDAQ|IAC}}.

Ask.com's corporate headquarters are located at [[555 City Center]], in the [[Oakland City Center]] development in downtown [[Oakland, California]].

==History==
[[Image:Jeeves-in-2009.jpg|thumb|Jeeves appears when users go to uk.ask.com, {{as of|2016|April}}|left]]Ask.com was originally known as Ask Jeeves, "Jeeves" being the name of a "gentleman's personal gentleman", or [[valet]], fetching answers to any question asked. The character was based on [[Bertie Wooster]]'s valet [[Jeeves]], in the fictional works of [[P.&amp;nbsp;G. Wodehouse]].

The original idea behind Ask Jeeves was to allow users to get answers to questions posed in everyday, [[natural language]], as well as by traditional keyword searching. The current Ask.com still supports this, with support for math, dictionary, and conversion questions.

In 2005 the company announced plans to phase out Jeeves and on February 27, 2006, the character disappeared from Ask.com. He was stated to be "going into retirement."  However, the UK/Ireland edition of the website prominently brought the character back in 2009.

IAC owns a variety of sites including country-specific sites for UK, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and Spain along with Ask Kids, [[Teoma]] (now ExpertRank&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120707054014/http://about.ask.com/en/docs/about/webmasters.shtml Ask.com Search Technology]. Retrieved May 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[IAC (company)#Properties|several others]]. On June 5, 2007, Ask.com relaunched with a 3D look.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.techcrunch.com/2007/06/04/major-relaunch-for-ask-ask3d/ Major Relaunch For Ask: Ask3D], [[Techcrunch]], June 4, 2007. Retrieved June 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 16, 2006, Ask implemented a "Binoculars Site Preview" into its search results. On search results pages, the "Binoculars" let searchers have a sneak peek of the page they could visit with a mouse-over activating a pop-up screenshot.

In December 2007, Ask released the AskEraser feature,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2007/07/ask-com-takes-lead-log-retention-microsoft-and-yahoo-follow Ask.com Takes the Lead on Log Retention; Microsoft and Yahoo!

===Search engine shut-down===
In 2010, Ask.com abandoned the search industry, with the loss of 130 search engineering jobs, because it could not compete against more popular search engines such as [[Google]]. Earlier in the year, Ask had launched a Q&amp;A community for generating answers from real people as opposed to search algorithms then combined this with its question-and–answer repository, utilizing its extensive history of archived query data to search sites that provide answers to questions people have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Grove|first=Jennifer|title=Ask.com Reinvents Itself with a Focus on Community Q&amp;A|url=http://mashable.com/2010/07/26/ask-beta/|work=Mashable|publisher=Mashable|accessdate=August 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid a situation in which no answers were available from its own resources, the company outsourced to an unnamed third-party search provider the comprehensive web search matches that it had gathered itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kopytoff|first=Verne|title=Ask.com to Return to Old Service|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/technology/internet/10ask.html|work=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|date=November 9, 2010|accessdate=August 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ask Sponsored Listings===
Formerly the direct sales engine for Ask.com, Ask Sponsored Listings is no longer available, having merged with Sendori, an operating business of IAC, in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ask Sponsored Listings is now Sedori|url=http://advertisersupport.sendori.com/entries/20191622-ask-sponsored-listings-is-now-sendori|publisher=Sendori|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate details==
[[Image:Askcomheadquarters.jpg|thumb|Ask.com headquarters in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], California|left]]Ask Jeeves, Inc. stock traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange from July 1999 to July 2005, under the ticker symbol ASKJ. In July 2005, the ASKJ ticker was retired upon the acquisition by IAC, valuing  at US$1.85&amp;nbsp;billion.

In 2012 Ask.com made two acquisitions as part of a larger strategy to offer more content on the Ask.com website. On July 2, 2012, Ask.com purchased content discovery start-up&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=de Senerpont Domis |first=Olaf |title=Q&amp;A with Ask.com's CEO and nRelate's Founder |url=http://www.thedeal.com/content/tmt/qa-with-askcoms-ceo-and-nrelates-founder.php |publisher=The Deal Pipeline |accessdate=October 23, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710110209/http://www.thedeal.com/content/tmt/qa-with-askcoms-ceo-and-nrelates-founder.php |archivedate=July 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; nRelate, for an undisclosed amount. That was followed by the company's acquisition of expert advice and information site About.com, which closed in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Christopher|title=Times Co.

On August 14, 2014, Ask.com acquired popular social networking website [[ASKfm]], where users can ask other users questions, with the option of anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Magid|first1=Larry|title=IAC's Ask.com Buys Ask.fm And Hires A Safety Officer To Stem Bullying|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/larrymagid/2014/08/14/iacs-ask-com-buys-ask-fm-and-hires-a-safety-officer-to-stem-bullying/|website=Forbes|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 14, 2014, Ask.fm had 180 million monthly unique users in more than 150 countries around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Curtis|first1=Sophie|title=Tinder owner buys social network ASKfm|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11034923/Tinder-owner-buys-social-network-Ask.fm.html|website=The Telegraph|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its largest user base in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Laurie|title=Ask.com Acquires Q&amp;A Social Network Ask.fm, Prepares To Add Tools To Increase Safety|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/232144/askcom-acquires-qa-social-network-askfm-prepar.html|website=Media Post|publisher=Media Post|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Available on the web and as a mobile app, ASKfm generates an estimated 20,000 questions per minute with approximately 45 percent of its mobile [[monthly active users]] logging in daily.&lt;ref name="Techcrunch"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perez|first1=Sarah|title=IAC Agrees To Work With Regulators On Cyberbullying Protections Following ASKfm Deal|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/14/ask-com-agrees-to-work-with-regulators-on-cyberbullying-protections-following-ask-fm-acquisition/|website=Techcrunch|publisher=Techcrunch|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the mobile app has been downloaded more than 40 million times.&lt;ref name="Techcrunch"/&gt;

==Toolbar criticism==

The Ask [[browser toolbar]] is an [[browser extension|extension]] that can appear as an extra bar added to the browser's window and/or menu. In early versions, it was often unintentionally installed during the installation of partner software, including Oracle [[Java (software platform)|Java]], i.e., taking advantage of a user's lack of technical experience.&lt;ref name="LookInto"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bott, Ed | date = January 22, 2013 | title = A Close Look at How Oracle Installs Deceptive Software with Java Updates | url = http://www.zdnet.com/article/a-close-look-at-how-oracle-installs-deceptive-software-with-java-updates/ | journal = [[ZDNet|ZD Net]] | publisher = [[CBS Interactive]] | format = online | access-date = January 1, 2016 | quote = Oracle's Java plugin for browsers is a notoriously insecure product. Over the past 18 months, the company has released 11 updates, six of them containing critical security fixes. With each update, Java actively tries to install unwanted software. Here's what it does, and why it has to stop… IAC, which partners with [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] to deliver the Ask toolbar, uses deceptive techniques to install its software...The Ask.com search page delivers inferior search results and uses misleading and possibly illegal techniques to deceive visitors into clicking paid ads instead of organic search results. }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an operating business of IAC, Ask Partner Network had also historically entered into partnerships with some software security vendors,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} whereby they distributed the toolbar alongside their software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ask Partner Network|url=http://www.apn.ask.com/|accessdate=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Installer packages for partner companies had an option (opt-out) to install the Ask toolbar and/or change the user's default browser home page to Ask.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ask Help Center|url=http://help.ask.com/link/portal/30015/30018/Article/229/Why-is-Ask-com-my-new-browser-home-page|accessdate=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ask.com and its parent company IAC have therefore been criticized for promoting a toolbar that behaves like [[malware]]—that it was surreptitiously bundled with legitimate program installations, e.g., [[Oracle (software)|Oracle]]'s [[Java (language)|Java]], that it could not be easily removed from common browsers once installed, that consumers installed the software unwittingly, that the toolbar redefined the user's home page to Ask.com, and that Ask.com presented biased search results.&lt;ref name="LookInto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Heddings, Lowell | date = February 19, 2013 | title = The Shameful Saga of Uninstalling the Terrible Ask Toolbar | url = http://www.howtogeek.com/138516/the-shameful-saga-of-uninstalling-the-terrible-ask-toolbar/ | journal = How-To Geek | format = online | access-date = January 1, 2016 | quote = If you managed to get infected with the absolutely terrible Ask Toolbar on your computer, don’t be ashamed – it could happen to anybody. Especially considering that is bundled with the equally awful Java runtime. Those people should be ashamed of themselves. }}&lt;/ref&gt; As early toolbar versions could not be easily removed using built-in uninstall features, it was considered a "potentially unwanted program".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://uk.pcmag.com/browsers-reviews-and/14164/feature/how-to-remove-the-askcom-toolbar-from-your-browser |title=PC Magazine: How to Remove the Ask.com Toolbar From Your Browser |first= |last= |work=uk.pcmag.com |accessdate=June 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RemoveAsk&gt;{{cite web|last=Rashid|first=Fahmida|title=How to remove the Ask.com Toolbar from your browser|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2421591,00.asp|work=PCmag|publisher=Ziff Davis|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further criticism was a ten-minute delay that was built into the installation, between updating Java and appearance of the Ask toolbar.&lt;ref name="OracleCrapware"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9236273/Oracle_will_continue_to_bundle_crapware_with_Java |title=Oracle will continue to bundle 'crapware' with Java |work=[[Computerworld]] |date=January 28, 2013 |quote=Bott found that the Ask.com toolbar was not immediately installed, but waited 10 minutes after Java finished to kick in. "I've never seen a legitimate program with an installer that behaves this way", said Bott}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company defended these early business decisions,{{who|date=January 2016}}{{where?|date=January 2016}} pointing out that instructions to remove the toolbar could be found at the Ask.com Help Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKirdy|first1=Eric|title=Ask.com Help Center|url=http://help.ask.com/link/portal/30015/30018/Article/1/How-do-I-remove-the-Ask-com-Toolbar|website=Ask.com|publisher=Ask.com|accessdate=August 29, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903091526/http://help.ask.com/link/portal/30015/30018/Article/1/How-do-I-remove-the-Ask-com-Toolbar|archive-date=September 3, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2015, Ask.com no longer bundles with Oracle's Java (which now features a [[Yahoo!]] toolbar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Keizer, Gregg | date = June 12, 2015  | title=Microsoft deletes older Ask.com browser toolbars, but ignores Oracle's new crapware | url = http://www.computerworld.com/article/2935575/web-browsers/microsoft-deletes-older-ask-com-browser-toolbars-but-ignores-oracles-new-crapware.html | journal = Computer World | format = online | publisher = Computerworld.com | accessdate=August 3, 2015 | quote = Microsoft took what appeared to be a shot at Oracle's wallet this month when it switched on search-and-destroy in its security software for older versions of the Ask browser toolbar, which has long been bundled with Java even in the face of users' complaints.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2015, [[Microsoft]] does not consider the toolbar that is being provided by Ask.com to be unwanted software, but they state that older versions of the toolbar pose "a high threat to your PC," and they provide tools for detecting and removing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2934502/microsofts-good-deed-for-the-day-browser-hijacking-ask-toolbar-gets-the-banhammer-on-windows.html|title=Microsoft's good deed for the day: browser-hijacking Ask Toolbar gets the banhammer on Windows}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/entry.aspx?Name=BrowserModifier%3AWin32%2FAskToolbarNotifier&amp;wa=wsignin1.0#tab=1|title=Microsoft Malware Protection Center - BrowserModifier:Win32/AskToolbarNotifier|first=|last=|work=microsoft.com|accessdate=June 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611203314/http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/entry.aspx?Name=BrowserModifier%3AWin32%2FAskToolbarNotifier&amp;wa=wsignin1.0#tab=1|archive-date=June 11, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing and promotion==

[[Apostolos Gerasoulis]], the co-creator of Ask's Teoma algorithmic search technology, starred in four television advertisements in 2007, extolling the virtues of Ask.com's usefulness for information relevance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.ask.com/docs/about/televisionads.shtml |title=About Ask.com: TV Spots |accessdate=April 25, 2007 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070410132033/http://about.ask.com/docs/about/televisionads.shtml |archivedate=April 10, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Jeeves balloon appeared in the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] through 2000-2004.

After a hiatus from mass consumer marketing, Ask returned to TV advertising in the fall of 2011 after refocusing its site on questions and answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Ha|first= Anthony|title= Ask.com Returns to TV, Cautiously|url= http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/askcom-returns-tv-cautiously-136064|publisher= AdWeek|accessdate=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of national advertising, Ask focused on local markets with [[basic creative]]. In the summer of 2012, Ask launched a national cinema campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Vega|first= Tanzina|title= Ask.com Heralds a New Focus|url= http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/new-ask-com-ads-highlight-change-in-focus|publisher= New York Times|accessdate= November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with other out-of-home tactics in certain markets such as New York and [[Seattle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Sandoval|first= Greg|title= Hey, Times Square! I'm Google+. Please Notice Me|url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57512960-93/hey-times-square-im-google--please-notice-me/|publisher= CNET|accessdate= November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of a Seattle-based local market effort, Ask.com launched its
“You Asked We Answered”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Laurie|title=Ask.com Launches 'You Asked' Branding Campaign|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/173829/askcom-launches-you-asked-branding-campaign.html|publisher=Media Post|accessdate=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; campaign in 2012, in which the company “answered” residents' top complaints about living in their city, including easing morning commutes and stadium traffic, as well as keeping the local Parks and Rec department wading pools open.

On January 14, 2009, Ask.com became the official sponsor of 2000 [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]] Champion [[Bobby Labonte]]'s No.&amp;nbsp;96 [[Ford]]. Ask would become the official search engine of NASCAR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Official Release |url= http://www.nascar.com/2009/news/headlines/cup/01/14/ask.com.partnerships/index.html |title= – Ask.com enters NASCAR with multi-faceted program |publisher= Nascar.com |date=January 14, 2009 |accessdate=July 12, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110628181843/http://www.nascar.com/2009/news/headlines/cup/01/14/ask.com.partnerships/index.html| archivedate= June 28, 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ask.com was the primary sponsor for the No.&amp;nbsp;96 for 18 of the first 21 races and had rights to increase this to a total of 29 races that season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Duane Cross |url=http://bbs.cid.cn.nascar.com/2009/news/headlines/cup/01/13/blabonte.hof.racing/index.html |title=Labonte will drive No. 96 for Hall of Fame in 2009 – 14 January 2009 |publisher=Bbs.cid.cn.nascar.com |accessdate=July 12, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714154201/http://bbs.cid.cn.nascar.com/2009/news/headlines/cup/01/13/blabonte.hof.racing/index.html |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ask.com car debuted in the 2009 Bud Shootout where it failed to finish the race, but subsequently returned strongly, placing as high as 5th in March 1, 2009 [[Shelby 427]] race at [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ask.com/nascar/2009-Shelby-427-race#results ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331204759/http://www.ask.com/nascar/2009-Shelby-427-race#results |date=March 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ask.com's foray into NASCAR represented the first instance of its venture into what it calls [[Vertical search|"Super Verticals"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://searchengineland.com/askcom-partners-with-nascar-says-super-vertical-will-put-it-back-in-search-race-16143 |title= Ask.com Partners With NASCAR, Says "Super Verticals" Will Put It Back In Search Race |publisher= Searchengineland.com |date=January 13, 2009 |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}

'''Broadway''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɔː|d|w|eɪ}} is a road in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Broadway runs from [[State Street (Manhattan)|State Street]] at [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] for {{convert|13|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} through the [[Boroughs of New York City|borough]] of [[Manhattan]] and {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} through [[the Bronx]], exiting north from the city to run an additional {{convert|18|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} through the municipalities of [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]], [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York|Hastings-On-Hudson]], [[Dobbs Ferry, New York|Dobbs Ferry]], [[Irvington, New York|Irvington]], and [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]], and terminating north of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref&gt;There are four other streets named "Broadway" in New York City's remaining three boroughs: one each in [[Brooklyn]] ([[Broadway (Brooklyn)|see main article]]) and [[Staten Island]], and two in [[Queens]] (one running from [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]] to [[Elmhurst, Queens|Elmhurst]], and the other in [[Hamilton Beach, Queens|Hamilton Beach]]). Each borough therefore has a street named "Broadway". See also from [[Forgotten NY]]:

&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the oldest north–south main thoroughfare in New York City, dating to the first [[New Amsterdam]] settlement, although most of it did not bear its current name until the late 19th century. The name ''Broadway'' is the English language [[calque|literal translation]] of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name, ''[[wikt:breed#Dutch|Brede]] [[wikt:weg#Dutch|weg]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (May 29, 1893) [https://www.nytimes.com/1893/05/29/archives/some-new-publications-peter-stuyvesants-unhappy-rule-peter.html "Some New Publication: Peter Stuyvesant's Unhappy Rule"], ''[[The New York Times]]''. Accessed June 16, 2016. "One other thing which came from the Dutch is the name of our street, Broadway, which by them was called the Breede Weg, the translation being afterward made by the English."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1776 NYC Map" /&gt;

Broadway in Manhattan is known widely as the heart of the [[Broadway theatre|American theatre industry]], and is used as a [[metonym]] for it.

==History==

Broadway was originally the [[Wickquasgeck]] Trail, carved into the brush of Manhattan by its [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Streets Where History Lives |first=Russell |last=Shorto|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/09/opinion/the-streets-where-history-lives-292257.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 9, 2004 |accessdate=April 4, 2008 |quote=And what about a marker for the Wickquasgeck Trail, the Indian path that ran the length of the island, which the Dutch made into their main highway and the English renamed Broadway?

Upon the arrival of the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]], the trail soon became the main road through the island from ''Nieuw Amsterdam'' at the southern tip. The Dutch explorer and entrepreneur [[David Pietersz. de Vries]] gives the first mention of it in his journal for the year 1642 ("the Wickquasgeck Road over which the Indians passed daily"). The Dutch named the road "''Breede Weg''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Epic of New York City |author=Ellis, Edward Robb |authorlink=Edward Robb Ellis |publisher=Old Town Books |year=1966 |pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although current street signs are simply labeled as "Broadway", in a 1776 map of New York City, Broadway is explicitly labeled "Broadway Street".&lt;ref name="1776 NYC Map"&gt;See the map inset.

In the 18th century, Broadway ended at the town commons north of [[Wall Street]], where traffic continued up the [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]] of the island via [[Eastern Post Road]] and the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] via Bloomingdale Road. The western Bloomingdale Road would be widened and paved during the 19th century, and called "Western Boulevard"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gpxBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130 Traffic regulations for the Western Boulevard] General Ordinances of the City of New York&lt;/ref&gt; or "The Boulevard" north of the Grand Circle, now called [[Columbus Circle]]. On February 14, 1899, the name "Broadway" was extended to the entire Broadway/Bloomingdale/Boulevard road.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120906001428/http://www.ny1.com/6-bronx-news-content/features/4215/february-14th-in-nyc-history February 14th in NYC History: 1899], referred to as "the 'Western' Boulevard"; called "the 'Grand' Boulevard" in ''The New York Times'', February 1869, quoted in Michael V. Susi, ''The Upper West Side'' "Introduction", 2009:7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traffic flow===
Broadway once was a [[two-way street]] for its entire length. The present status, in which it runs [[one-way traffic|one-way]] southbound south of [[Columbus Circle]] ([[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]]), came about in several stages. On June 6, 1954, [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] became southbound and [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] became northbound south of Broadway. None of Broadway became one-way, but the increased southbound traffic between Columbus Circle (Eighth Avenue) and [[Times Square]] (Seventh Avenue) caused the city to re-stripe that section of Broadway for four southbound and two northbound lanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=7th and 8th Aves.

Another change was made on November 10, 1963, when Broadway became one-way southbound from Herald Square to [[Madison Square]] ([[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]]) and [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] ([[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]]) to Canal Street, and two routes – [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] south of Herald Square and [[Centre Street (Manhattan)|Centre Street]], [[Lafayette Street]], and [[Fourth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fourth Avenue]] south of Union Square – became one-way northbound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=City to Extend One-Way Traffic to 3 Manhattan Routes Sunday |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/11/05/archives/city-to-extend-oneway-traffic-to-3-manhattan-routes-sunday-broadway.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 5, 1963 |page=1 |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, at the same time as [[Madison Avenue]] became one-way northbound and [[Fifth Avenue]] became one-way southbound, Broadway was made one-way southbound between [[Madison Square]] (where Fifth Avenue crosses) and [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] on January 14, 1966, completing its conversion south of Columbus Circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=5th and Madison Will Go One-Way Early Next Year |first=Joseph C. |last=Ingraham |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1965/05/12/archives/5th-and-madison-will-go-oneway-early-next-year-barnes-also-says.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 12, 1965 |page=1 |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Barnes Suggests Express Bus Runs|first=Farnsworth|last=Fowle|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/01/17/archives/barnes-suggests-express-bus-runs-says-oneway-traffic-flow-will.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 17, 1966|page=1|accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a one-block section of Broadway between [[72nd Street (Manhattan)|72nd Street]] and [[73rd Street (Manhattan)|73rd Street]] at [[Verdi Square]] was reconfigured. Its easternmost lanes, which formerly hosted northbound traffic, were turned into a public park when a new subway entrance for the [[72nd Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|72nd Street]]  station was built in the exact location of these lanes. Northbound traffic on Broadway is now channeled onto [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Amsterdam Avenue]] to 73rd Street, makes a left turn on the three-lane 73rd Street, and then a right turn on Broadway shortly afterward.

In August 2008, two traffic lanes from 42nd to 35th Streets were taken out of service and converted to public plazas. Additionally, bike lanes were added on Broadway from 42nd Street down to Union Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=City to Make Two Broadway Lanes Bikes, Walkers Only for Seven Blocks |first=Pete |last=Donohue |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/07/10/2008-07-10_city_to_make_two_broadway_lanes_bikes_wa.html |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |location=New York |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/broadwayblvd.pdf Broadway Boulevard I]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Times Square, Broadway, May 2016.jpg|thumb|left|267px|The segment of Broadway in Times Square]]

Since May 2009, the portions of Broadway through Duffy Square, Times Square, and Herald Square have been closed entirely to automobile traffic, except for cross traffic on the Streets and Avenues, as part of a traffic and pedestrianization experiment, with the pavement reserved exclusively for walkers, cyclists, and those lounging in temporary seating placed by the city. The city decided that the experiment was successful and decided to make the change permanent in February 2010. Though the anticipated benefits to traffic flow were not as large as hoped, pedestrian injuries dropped dramatically and foot traffic increased in the designated areas; the project was popular with both residents and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New York Traffic Experiment Gets Permanent Run |first=Michael M. |last=Grynbaum |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 11, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/nyregion/12broadway.html |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current portions converted into pedestrian plazas are between West 47th Street and West 42nd Street within Times and Duffy Squares, and between West 35th Street and West 33rd Street in the Herald Square area. Additionally, portions of Broadway in the Madison Square and Union Square have been dramatically narrowed, allowing ample pedestrian plazas to exist along the side of the road.

In May 2013, the [[New York City Department of Transportation|NYCDOT]] decided to redesign Broadway between 35th and 42nd Streets for the second time in five years, owing to poor connections between pedestrian plazas and decreased vehicular traffic. With the new redesign, the bike lane is now on the right side of the street; it was formerly on the left side adjacent to the pedestrian plazas, causing conflicts between pedestrian and bicycle traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2012-10-22-broadway-blvd-35-42.pdf Broadway Boulevard II]&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 2017,  as part of a capital reconstruction of Worth Square, Broadway between 24th and 25th Street was converted to a "[[Shared space|shared street]]" where through vehicles are banned and delivery vehicles are restricted to {{convert|5|mph|km/h}}. Delivery vehicles go northbound from Fifth Avenue to 25th Street for that one block, reversing the direction of traffic and preventing vehicles from going south on Broadway south of 25th Street. The capital project expands on a 2008 initiative where part of the intersection of Broadway and Fifth Avenue was repurposed into a public plaza, simplifying that intersection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.madisonsquarepark.org/about-the-park/worth-square-project|title=Worth Square Project|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Madison Square Park Conservancy|access-date=May 14, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the 2017 project, Worth Square was expanded, converting the adjoining block of Broadway into a "shared street."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/flatiron-shared-street-mar2017.pdf|title=Flatiron Shared Street CB 5 Transportation Committee|publisher=[[New York City Department of Transportation]]|date=March 27, 2017|accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Route description===
[[File:Broadway, looking north from Broome Street, Manhattan (circa 1853-1855).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Looking north from Broome Street (circa 1853-55)]]

Broadway runs the length of Manhattan Island, roughly parallel to the [[North River (Hudson River)|North River]] (the portion of the [[Hudson River]] bordering Manhattan), from [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] at the south to [[Inwood, Manhattan|Inwood]] at the northern tip of the island. South of [[Columbus Circle]], it is a one-way southbound street. Since 2009, vehicular traffic has been banned at [[Times Square]] between [[47th Street (Manhattan)|47th]] and [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Streets]], and at [[Herald Square]] between 35th and 33rd Streets as part of a pilot program; the right-of-way is intact and reserved for cyclists and pedestrians. From the northern shore of Manhattan, Broadway crosses [[Spuyten Duyvil Creek]] via the [[Broadway Bridge (Manhattan)|Broadway Bridge]] and continues through [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] (a discontinuous portion of the borough of Manhattan) and [[the Bronx]] into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. 9]] continues to be known as Broadway until its junction with [[New York State Route 117|NY 117]].

====Lower Manhattan====
[[File:Upbroadway e.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A view up Broadway from Bowling Green, with the [[Chrysler Building]] visible in the background]]

The section of lower Broadway from its origin at Bowling Green to City Hall Park is the historical location for the city's [[ticker-tape parade]]s, and is sometimes called the "[[#Canyon of Heroes|Canyon of Heroes]]" during such events. West of Broadway, as far as [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]], was the city's fashionable residential area until circa 1825; landfill has more than tripled the area, and the [[Hudson River]] shore now lies far to the west, beyond [[Tribeca]] and [[Battery Park City]].

Broadway marks the boundary between [[Greenwich Village]] to the west and the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] to the east, passing [[Astor Place]]. It is a short walk from there to [[New York University]] near [[Washington Square Park]], which is at the foot of [[Fifth Avenue]]. A bend in front of [[Grace Church (Manhattan)|Grace Church]] allegedly avoids an earlier tavern; from 10th Street it begins its long diagonal course across Manhattan, headed almost due north.

====Midtown Manhattan====
[[File:Bway.jpg|thumb|right|175px|A view of Broadway in 1909]]

Because Broadway preceded the grid that the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]] imposed on the island, Broadway crosses [[midtown Manhattan]] diagonally, intersecting with both the east-west streets and north-south avenues. Broadway's intersections with avenues, marked by "[[town square|squares]]" (some merely triangular slivers of open space), have induced some interesting architecture, such as the [[Flatiron Building]].

At [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]], Broadway crosses [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]], merges with [[Park Avenue|Fourth Avenue]], and continues its diagonal uptown course from the Square's northwest corner; Union Square is the only location wherein the physical section of Broadway is discontinuous in Manhattan (other portions of Broadway in Manhattan are pedestrian-only plazas). At [[Madison Square]], the location of the Flatiron Building, Broadway crosses Fifth Avenue at [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]], and is discontinuous to vehicles for a one-block stretch between 24th and 25th Streets. At [[Greeley Square]] (West 33rd Street), Broadway crosses [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] (Avenue of the Americas), and is discontinuous to vehicles. [[Macy's Herald Square]] department store, one block north of the vehicular discontinuity, is located on the northwest corner of Broadway and West 34th Street and southwest corner of Broadway and West 35th Street; it is one of the largest [[department store]]s in the world.

One famous stretch near [[Times Square]], where Broadway crosses Seventh Avenue in [[midtown Manhattan]], is the home of many [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[theatre (structure)|theatres]], housing an ever-changing array of commercial, large-scale plays, particularly [[musical theatre|musicals]]. This area of Manhattan is often called the [[Theater District, Manhattan|Theater District]] or the Great White Way, a nickname originating in the headline "Found on the Great White Way" in the edition of February 3, 1902 of the ''[[New York Evening Telegram]]''. The journalistic nickname was inspired by the millions of lights on theater [[Marquee (sign)|marquees]] and [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] advertisements that illuminate the area. After becoming the city's de facto [[red-light district]] in the 1960s and 1970s (as can be seen in the films ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]''), since the late 1980s Times Square has emerged as a family tourist center, in effect being [[Disneyfication|Disneyfied]] following the company's purchase and renovation of the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]] on 42nd Street in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlap, David W. [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/28/nyregion/after-a-decade-disney-chief-sees-new-flair-on-42nd-st.html "After a Decade, Disney Chief Sees New 'Flair' on 42nd St."], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 28, 2004.

He emerged from under the marquee of the New Amsterdam Theater, whose opulent revival in Disney's hands has been credited as a key catalyst in the redevelopment of 42nd Street."&lt;/ref&gt;

Until June 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'', from which the Square gets its name, was published at offices at 239 West 43rd Street; the paper stopped printing papers there on June 15, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Copy! |first=David W. |last=Dunlap |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/weekinreview/10dunlap.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 10, 2007 |accessdate=October 10, 2008 |quote=The sound is muffled by wall-to-wall carpet tiles and fabric-lined cubicles.

====Upper West Side====

At the southwest corner of [[Central Park]], Broadway crosses [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] (called Central Park West north of 59th Street) at [[59th Street (Manhattan)|West 59th Street]] and [[Columbus Circle]]; on the site of the former [[New York Coliseum]] convention center is the new shopping center at the foot of the [[Time Warner Center]], headquarters of [[Time Warner]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregor, Alison. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/18/realestate/commercial/18circle.html "A New Star in the Columbus Circle Orbit"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 18, 2006. Accessed June 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; From Columbus Circle northward, Broadway becomes a wide [[boulevard]] to 169th Street; it retains landscaped [[median (road)|center islands]] that separate northbound from southbound traffic.  The medians are a vestige of the central mall of "The Boulevard" that had become the spine of the [[Upper West Side]], and many of these contain public seating.

Broadway intersects with [[Columbus Avenue (Manhattan)|Columbus Avenue]] (known as Ninth Avenue south of [[59th Street (Manhattan)|West 59th Street]]) at West 65th and 66th Streets where the [[Juilliard School]] and [[Lincoln Center]], both well-known performing arts landmarks, as well as the [[Manhattan New York Temple]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] are located.

[[File:72Bway.png|thumb|right|175px|X-shaped intersection of Broadway (from lower right to upper left) and Amsterdam Avenue (lower left to upper right), looking north from Sherman Square to West 72nd Street and the treetops of Verdi Square]]

Between West 70th and 73rd Streets, Broadway intersects with [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Amsterdam Avenue]] (known as 10th Avenue south of West 59th Street).  The wide intersection of the two thoroughfares has historically been the site of numerous traffic accidents and pedestrian casualties, partly due to the long crosswalks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Safety Fixes Slated for One of Manhattan's Most Dangerous Intersections | url = http://www.streetsblog.org/2010/09/23/safety-fixes-slated-for-one-of-manhattans-most-dangerous-intersections/ | accessdate = February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two small triangular plots of land were created at points where Broadway slices through Amsterdam Avenue.  One is a tiny fenced-in patch of shrubbery and plants at West 70th Street called [[Sherman Square]] (although it and the surrounding intersection have also been known collectively as Sherman Square), and the other triangle is a lush tree-filled garden bordering Amsterdam Avenue from just above West 72nd Street to West 73rd Street. Named [[Verdi Square]] in 1921 for its monument to Italian composer [[Giuseppe Verdi]], which was erected in 1909, this triangular sliver of public space was designated a Scenic Landmark by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1974, one of nine city parks that have received the designation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/verdi-square Verdi Square], [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].

The original brick and stone shelter leading to the entrance of the [[72nd Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|72nd Street]] subway station, one of the [[Early history of the IRT subway|first 28 subway stations]] in Manhattan, remains located on one of the wide islands in the center of Broadway, on the south side of West 72nd Street.  For many years, all traffic on Broadway flowed on either side of this median and its subway entrance, and its uptown lanes went past it along the western edge of triangular Verdi Square.  In 2001 and 2002, renovation of the historic 72nd Street station and the addition of a second subway control house and passenger shelter on an adjacent center median just north of 72nd Street, across from the original building, resulted in the creation of a public plaza with stone pavers and extensive seating, connecting the newer building with Verdi Square, and making it necessary to divert northbound traffic to Amsterdam Avenue for one block.  While Broadway's southbound lanes at this intersection were unaffected by the new construction, its northbound lanes are no longer contiguous at this intersection.  Drivers can either continue along Amsterdam Avenue to head uptown or turn left on West 73rd Street to resume traveling on Broadway.

Several notable apartment buildings are in close proximity to this intersection, including [[The Ansonia]], its ornate architecture dominating the cityscape here. After the Ansonia first opened as a hotel, live seals were kept in indoor fountains inside its lobby.  Later, it was home to the infamous [[Plato's Retreat]] nightclub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=deCourcy Hinds|title=A Conversion Plan Roils the Ansonia|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/realestate/a-conversion-plan-roils-the-ansonia.html?smid=pl-share|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 8, 1987|accessdate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately north of Verdi Square is the formidable [[Apple Bank for Savings]] building, formerly the Central Savings Bank, which was built in 1926 and designed to resemble the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amsterdammin' from West 72nd–110th|url=http://forgotten-ny.com/2010/11/amsterdammin-from-west-72nd-110th/|date=November 2010|accessdate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadway is also home to the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]] at West 74th Street, designated a national landmark in 1979 and still in operation as a concert venue after its establishment in 1929 as a vaudeville and music hall, and "sister" venue to [[Radio City Music Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beacon Theatre History|url=http://www.beacontheatre.com/about/history.html|accessdate=February 10, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214014236/http://www.beacontheatre.com/about/history.html|archivedate=February 14, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its intersection with West 78th Street, Broadway shifts direction and continues directly uptown and aligned approximately with the Commissioners' grid. Past the bend are the historic  [[the Apthorp|Apthorp]] apartment building, built in 1908, and the [[First Baptist Church in the City of New York]], incorporated in New York in 1762, its current building on Broadway erected in 1891. The road heads north and passes historically important apartment houses such as [[the Belnord]], the [[Astor Court Building]], and the [[Art Nouveau]] [[The Cornwall|Cornwall]].&lt;ref&gt;Horsley, Carter B. [http://www.thecityreview.com/uws/bway/cornwall.html "The Cornwall"] ''City Review''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AIA4}} p. 351&lt;/ref&gt;

At Broadway and 95th Street is [[Symphony Space]], established in 1978 as home to avant-garde and classical music and dance performances in the former Symphony Theatre, which was originally built in 1918 as a premier "music and motion-picture house".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Written on the Screen| url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/04/21/102693641.pdf | date = April 21, 1918 | accessdate=February 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Symphony Space History | url = http://www.symphonyspace.org/history | accessdate=February 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At 99th Street, Broadway passes between the controversial skyscrapers of [[the Ariel]] East and West.

At 107th Street, Broadway merges with [[West End Avenue]], with the intersection forming [[Straus Park]] with its Titanic Memorial by [[Augustus Lukeman]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/straus-park/history Straus Park], [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].

Broadway then passes the campus of [[Columbia University]] at [[116th Street (Manhattan)|116th Street]] in [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]], in part on the tract that housed the [[Bloomingdale Insane Asylum]] from 1808 until it moved to [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Lombardi, Kate Stone. [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/16/nyregion/hospital-marking-its-100th-year.html "Hospital Marking Its 100th Year"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 16, 1994. Accessed June 16, 2016. "When lower Broadway became more urbanized, the asylum was moved to upper Manhattan, on what is now the site of Columbia University. (The area was referred to as Bloomingdale -- vale of flowers -- by early Dutch settlers, and the hospital was named the Bloomingdale Asylum.) "&lt;/ref&gt; Still in Morningside Heights, Broadway passes the park-like campus of [[Barnard College]]. Next, the Gothic quadrangle of [[Union Theological Seminary (Manhattan)|Union Theological Seminary]] and the brick buildings of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] with their landscaped interior courtyards face one another across Broadway. On the next block is the [[Manhattan School of Music]].

Broadway then runs past the proposed uptown campus of Columbia University, and the main campus of [[City College of New York|CUNY–City College]] near 135th Street; the Gothic buildings of the original City College campus are out of sight, a block to the east. Also to the east are the [[brownstone]]s of Hamilton Heights. Hamilton Place is a surviving section of Bloomingdale Road, and originally the address of [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s house, [[Hamilton Grange National Memorial|The Grange]], which has been moved.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Eleanor Booth [http://myinwood.net/where-cobwebs-thrive-on-manhattan-isle/ Where Cobwebs Thrive on Manhattan Isle] ''New York Tribune;'' November 6, 1921&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadway achieves a verdant, park-like effect, particularly in the spring, when it runs between the uptown [[Trinity Church Cemetery]] and the former Trinity Chapel, now the [[Church of the Intercession (Manhattan)|Church of the Intercession]] near 155th Street.

[[NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital]] lies on Broadway near 166th, 167th, and 168th Streets in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]]. The intersection with [[St. Nicholas Avenue]] at 167th Street forms [[Mitchell Square Park]]. At 178th Street, [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. 9]] becomes concurrent with Broadway.

Broadway crosses the [[Harlem River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Manhattan)|Broadway Bridge]] to [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]]. Afterward, it then enters [[the Bronx]], where it is the eastern border of [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] and the western border of [[Van Cortlandt Park]]. At 253rd Street, [[New York State Route 9A|NY 9A]] joins with U.S. 9 and Broadway. (NY 9A splits off Broadway at Ashburton Avenue in Yonkers.)

====Westchester County====
[[File:US_Route_9_-_North_Broadway_-_Yonkers,_NY.jpg|thumb|right|287px|North Broadway ([[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. 9]]) in [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]]]]
 
The northwestern corner of the park marks the city limit and Broadway enters [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]], where it is now known as South Broadway. It trends ever westward, closer to the [[Hudson River]], remaining a busy urban commercial street. In downtown Yonkers, it drops close to the river, becomes North Broadway and 9A leaves via Ashburton Avenue. Broadway climbs to the nearby ridgetop runs parallel to the river and the railroad, a few blocks east of both as it passes [[St. John's Riverside Hospital]]. The neighborhoods become more residential and the road gently undulates along the ridgetop.&lt;ref name="nymap07"/&gt; In Yonkers, Broadway passes historic [[Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site|Philipse Manor]] house, which dates back to colonial America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nysparks.com/historic-sites/37/details.aspx|title=Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It remains Broadway as it leaves Yonkers for [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York|Hastings-on-Hudson]], where it splits into separate north and south routes for {{convert|0.6|mi|km|1}}. The trees become taller and the houses, many separated from the road by stone fences, become larger. Another National Historic Landmark, the [[John William Draper House]], was the site of the first [[astrophotograph]] of the [[Moon]].&lt;ref name="nymap07"&gt;{{cite map|title=1977–2007 I Love New York State Map|year=2007|publisher=[[I Love New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Washington Irving Memorial Irvington.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Washington Irving Memorial]] on North Broadway in [[Irvington, New York|Irvington]], not far from Irving's home, [[Sunnyside (Tarrytown, New York)|Sunnyside]]]]

In the next village, [[Dobbs Ferry, New York|Dobbs Ferry]], Broadway has various views of the Hudson River while passing through the residential section. Broadway passes by the [[Old Croton Aqueduct]] and nearby the shopping district of the village. After intersecting with Ashford Avenue, Broadway passes [[Mercy College (New York)|Mercy College]], then turns left again at the center of town just past [[South Presbyterian Church]], headed for equally comfortable [[Ardsley-on-Hudson, New York|Ardsley-on-Hudson]] and [[Irvington, New York|Irvington]]. [[Villa Lewaro]], the home of [[Madam C. J. Walker]], the first African-American millionaire, is along the highway here.&lt;ref name="Villa Lewaro"&gt;{{cite web |title=Villa Lewaro |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/pwwmh/ny22.htm |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |work=Places Where Women Made History |date=March 30, 1998 |accessdate=May 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the north end of the village of Irvington, a [[Washington Irving Memorial|memorial]] to writer [[Washington Irving]], after whom the village was renamed, marks the turnoff to his home at [[Sunnyside (Tarrytown, New York)|Sunnyside]]. Entering into the southern portion of Tarrytown, Broadway passes by historic [[Lyndhurst (mansion)|Lyndhurst mansion]], a massive mansion built along the Hudson River built in the early 1800s.

North of here, at the [[Kraft Foods]] technical center, the [[Tappan Zee Bridge (1955–2017)|Tappan Zee Bridge]] becomes visible. After crossing under the [[New York State Thruway|Thruway]] and I-87 again, here concurrent with [[Interstate 287|I-287]], and then intersecting with the four-lane [[New York State Route 119|NY&amp;nbsp;119]], where 119 splits off to the east, Broadway becomes the busy main street of [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]]. [[Christ Episcopal Church (Tarrytown, New York)|Christ Episcopal Church]], where Irving worshiped,&lt;ref name="Christ Episcopal Church NRHP nom"&gt;{{cite web |last=Larson |first=Neil |title=National Register of Historic Places nomination, Christ Episcopal Church |url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=10711 |publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]] |date=February 1987 |accessdate=June 11, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219184842/http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=10711 |archivedate=February 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; is along the street. Many high quality restaurants and shops are along this main road. This downtown ends at the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 448|NY&amp;nbsp;448]], where Broadway slopes off to the left, downhill, and four signs indicate that Broadway turns left, passing the [[Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow]], another NHL. The road then enters [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] (formerly North Tarrytown), passing the visitors' center for [[Kykuit]], the [[National Historic Landmark]] that was (and partially still is) the [[Rockefeller family]]'s [[Estate (house)|estate]].&lt;ref name="nymap07"/&gt; Broadway then passes the historic [[Sleepy Hollow Cemetery]], which includes the resting place of Washington Irving and the setting for [[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sleepyhollowcemetery.org/|title=The Original Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in New York|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadway expands to four lanes at the trumpet intersection with [[New York State Route 117|NY&amp;nbsp;117]], where it finally ends and U.S.&amp;nbsp;9 becomes [[Albany Post Road]] (and Highland Avenue) at the northern border of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]].

===Nicknamed sections===

====Canyon of Heroes====
{{see also|List of ticker-tape parades in New York City}}
[[File:Apollo 11 ticker tape parade 2.jpg|thumb|right|267px|Canyon of Heroes during a ticker-tape parade for the [[Apollo 11]] [[astronaut]]s on August 13, 1969]]

''Canyon of Heroes'' is occasionally used to refer to the section of lower Broadway in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] that is the location of the city's [[ticker-tape parade]]s.

The traditional route of the parade is northward from [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] to [[City Hall Park]]. Most of the route is lined with tall office buildings along both sides, affording a view of the parade for thousands of office workers who create the snowstorm-like jettison of shredded paper products that characterize the parade.

While typical sports championship parades have been showered with some 50 tons of confetti and shredded paper, the [[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]] parade on August 14–15, 1945 – marking the end of [[World War II]] – was covered with 5,438 tons of paper, based on estimates provided by the [[New York City Department of Sanitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Q &amp; A: Today's Giants Ticker-Tape Parade|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/q-a-todays-giants-ticker-tape-parade/ |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 200 black granite strips embedded in the sidewalks along the Canyon of Heroes list honorees of past ticker-tape parades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Super Bowl-Winning Giants Get Canyon of Heroes Honor |first=Fernanda |last=Santos |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/nyregion/11bloomberg.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 11, 2008 |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |quote=The plaque is one of the more than 200 granite strips in a route known as the Canyon of Heroes, marking those who have been honored by the city with ticker-tape parades.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent parade up the Canyon of Heroes took place on July 10, 2015 for the [[United States women's national soccer team]] in honor of their [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup]] championship.&lt;ref&gt;West, Melanie Grayce and King, Kate. (July 10, 2015) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/nyc-ticker-tape-parade-for-u-s-womens-soccer-steps-off-friday-1436522401 "NYC Ticker-Tape Parade for U.S. Women's Soccer Steps Off Friday"] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Great White Way====

"The Great White Way" is a nickname for a section of Broadway in [[Midtown Manhattan]], specifically the portion that encompasses the [[Theater District, Manhattan|Theater District]], between [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd]] and [[53rd Street (Manhattan)|53rd Streets]], and encompassing [[Times Square]].

In 1880, a stretch of Broadway between [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] and [[Madison Square]] was illuminated by [[Charles F. Brush|Brush]] [[arc lamp]]s, making it among the first electrically lighted streets in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p. 1063&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1890s, the portion from [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]] to [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] was so brightly illuminated by electrical advertising signs, that people began calling it "The Great White Way".&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p. 1066&lt;/ref&gt; When the theater district moved uptown, the name was transferred to the Times Square area.

The phrase "Great White Way" has been attributed to Shep Friedman, columnist for the ''[[New York Morning Telegraph]]'' in 1901, who lifted the term from the title of a book about the Arctic by [[Albert Paine]].&lt;ref name="bloom"&gt;Bloom, Ken. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GBiEO8q59f0C&amp;pg=PA499&amp;dq=%22great+white+way%22+Shep+Friedman&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TDzQTNneAsKclgf-mOi9Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22great%20white%20way%22%20Shep%20Friedman&amp;f=false Broadway: its history, people, and places : an encyclopedia], p.499 (2003) ({{ISBN|978-0415937047}})&lt;/ref&gt;  The headline "Found on the Great White Way" appeared in the February 3, 1902, edition of the ''[[New York World-Telegram|New York Evening Telegram]]''.&lt;ref name="bloom"/&gt;

A portrait of Broadway in the early part of the 20th century and "The Great White Way" late at night appeared in "Artist In Manhattan" (1940)&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Myers, Artist in Manhattan, New York: American Artists Group, Inc. 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; written by the artist-historian [[Jerome Myers]]:

{{quote|Early morn on Broadway, the same light that tips the mountain tops of the Colorado canyons gradually discloses the quiet anatomy, the bare skeletons of the huge iron signs that trellis the sky, now denuded of the attractions of the volcanic night. Almost lifeless, the tired entertainers of the night clubs and their friends straggle to their rooms, taximen compare notes and earnings, the vast street scene has had its curtain call, the play is over.

Dear old Broadway, for many years have I dwelt on your borders. I have known the quiet note of your dawn. Even earlier I would take my coffee at Martin's, at 54th Street–now, alas, vanished–where I would see creatures of the night life before they disappeared with the dawn.

One night a celebrated female impersonator came to the restaurant in all his regalia, directly from a club across the street. Several taximen began to poke fun at him. Unable any longer to bear their taunts, he got up and knocked all the taximen out cold. Then he went back to the club, only to lament under his bitter tears, "See how they've ruined my dress!"

Gone are the old-time Broadway oyster bars and chop houses that were the survivors of a tradition of their sporting patrons, the bon vivants of Manhattan. Gone are the days when the Hoffman House flourished on Madison Square, with its famous nudes by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau|Bouguereau]]; when barrooms were palaces, on nearly every corner throughout the city; when [[Steve Brodie (bridge jumper)|Steve Brodie]], jumping from Brooklyn Bridge, splashed the entire country with publicity; when [[Bowery]] concert halls dispensed schooners of beer for a nickel, with a stage show thrown in; when Theis's Music Hall still resounded on 14th Street with its great mechanical organ, the wonder of its day, a place of beauty, with fine paintings and free company and the frankest of female life. Across the street was [[Tammany Hall]], and next to it [[Tony Pastor]]'s, where stars of the stage were born. Tony himself, in dress clothes and top hat, sang his ballads, a gallant trouper introducing [[Lillian Russell]] and others to fame through his audience.}}

From south to north, Broadway at one point or another runs over or under various [[New York City Subway]] lines, including the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]], the [[BMT Broadway Line]], [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]], and [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]] (the [[IND Sixth Avenue Line]] is the only north-south trunk line in Manhattan that does not run along Broadway).
* The IRT Lexington Avenue Line runs under Broadway from [[Bowling Green (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Bowling Green]] to [[Fulton Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Fulton Street]] ({{NYCS trains|Lexington south}}).
* The BMT Broadway Line runs under it from [[City Hall (BMT Broadway Line)|City Hall]] to [[Times Square–42nd Street (BMT Broadway Line)|Times Square–42nd Street]] ({{NYCS trains|Broadway}}).
* The IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line runs under and over Broadway from [[Times Square–42nd Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|Times Square]] to [[168th Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|168th Street]] ({{NYCS trains|Broadway-Seventh}}), and again from 218th Street to its terminal in [[the Bronx]] at [[Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street]] ({{NYCS trains|Broadway-Seventh north local}}).
* The northern portion of the IND Eighth Avenue Line runs under Broadway from [[Dyckman Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Dyckman Street]] to [[Inwood–207th Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Inwood–207th Street]] ({{NYCS trains|Eighth far north}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/nyct/maps/subwaymap.pdf|title=NYC Subway Map|publisher=MTA|accessdate=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[street railway]]s on Broadway included the Broadway and Seventh Avenue Railroad's Broadway and University Place Line (1864?) between [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] ([[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]]) and [[Times Square]] ([[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]]), the Ninth Avenue Railroad's [[Ninth and Amsterdam Avenues Line]] (1884) between 65th Street and 71st Street, the Forty-second Street, Manhattanville and St. Nicholas Avenue Railway's [[Broadway Branch Line]] (1885?) between Times Square and [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th Street]], and the Kingsbridge Railway's Kingsbridge Line&lt;!--when?--&gt; north of 169th Street. The Broadway Surface Railroad's [[Broadway Line (Lower Manhattan surface)|Broadway Line]], a [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] line, opened on lower Broadway (below Times Square) in 1893, and soon became the core of the [[Metropolitan Street Railway]], with two cable branches: the [[Broadway and Lexington Avenue Line]] and [[Broadway and Columbus Avenue Line]].

These streetcar lines were replaced with [[bus route]]s in the 1930s and 1940s. Before Broadway became one-way, the main bus routes along it were the [[New York City Omnibus Company]]'s (NYCO) [[6 (NYCO)|6]] (Broadway below Times Square), [[7 (NYCO)|7]] (Broadway and Columbus Avenue), and [[11 (NYCO)|11]] (Ninth and Amsterdam Avenues), and the [[Surface Transportation Corporation]]'s [[M100 (New York City bus)|M100]] (Kingsbridge) and [[M104 (New York City bus)|M104]] (Broadway Branch). Additionally, the [[Fifth Avenue Coach Company]]'s (FACCo) [[4 (FACCo)|4]] and 5 used Broadway from [[135th Street (Manhattan)|135th Street]] north to Washington Heights, and their 5 and 6 used Broadway between [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] and [[72nd Street (Manhattan)|72nd Street]]. With the implementation of one-way traffic, the northbound 6 and 7 were moved to [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]].

{{As of|2017}}, Broadway is served by the [[M4 (New York City bus)|M4]] (ex-FACCo 4), [[M7 (New York City bus)|M7]] (ex-NYCO 7), [[M55 (New York City bus)|M55]], [[M100 (New York City bus)|M100]], and [[M104 (New York City bus)|M104]]. Other routes that use part of Broadway include the [[M5 (New York City bus)|M5]] (ex-FACCo 5), [[M10 (New York City bus)|M10]], [[M20 (New York City bus)|M20]], [[M60 (New York City bus)|M60]] [[Select Bus Service#M60 route|Select Bus Service]], [[Bx7 (New York City bus)|Bx7]], [[Bx9 (New York City bus)|Bx9]], and [[Bx20 (New York City bus)|Bx20]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NYC bus map|M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bee-Line Bus System|Bee-Line]] buses also serves Broadway within [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] and Westchester County. Routes [[List of bus routes in Westchester County|1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 13]], and several others run on a portion of Broadway.

The '''California Mille''' is an annual historic and classic car tour run on public roads in [[California]].

It is inspired by the [[Mille Miglia]], a former [[Italy|Italian]] open-road endurance race covering some 1500&amp;nbsp;km (or roughly 1000 miles) from Brescia-to-Rome-to-Brescia and ran twenty-four times from 1927 to 1957. The event was founded by Martin Swig and Ken Shaff in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vaughn|first=Mark|title=Martin Swig, 1934-2012|journal=[[Autoweek]]|date=August 6, 2012|volume=62|issue=16|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20120705/carnews03/120709934|accessdate=August 8, 2012|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligibility==
The California Mille is open to cars that either ran or would have been eligible to run in the original event; hence participants cars must be designs from 1957 or earlier. The California Mille field is limited to 65 cars and applicants are screened for their car's historical significance and general condition; not all applicants are accepted. Fields generally include vintage [[Alfa Romeo]]s, [[Ferrari]]s, [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[Porsche]]s. Often pre-war examples are well represented in the fields as well as the more common post-war models.

==Course==
Each year's event covers no less than 1000 miles over four days. Though the route changes each year, it invariably starts at the [[Fairmont San Francisco|Fairmont Hotel]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and consists of back roads through some California's most scenic areas, including [[California State Route 1|Highway 1]] along Northern California's coast, [[Napa, California|Napa]] and [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]] valleys, and the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevadas]]. Each day is punctuated by several stops for meals and refreshments, arrangements having been made at significant wineries and restaurants, while overnight accommodation is generally at some of California's best hotels.

==Social context==
The event was founded in 1991 by automotive enthusiast Martin Swig and friends, it is supported by an informal group called the "Amici americani della Mille Miglia" ("American friends of the Mille Miglia" in Italian). The event attracts a number of corporate sponsors which have included [[Daimler-Chrysler]], [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] and Il Fornaio restaurants. The corporate sponsorship ensures that the California Mille remains one of the more exclusive and high quality events of its type. It does this by underwriting a substantial entourage of mechanical support and press that follows the event route. The event's proceeds benefit causes such as the 11-99 Foundation, a benefit fund for [[California Highway Patrol]] officers and their families.

Participants range from run-of-the-mill enthusiasts, though wealthy people by most standards,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The entry fee is $4,000 plus&lt;/ref&gt; to captains of the automotive industry and motor sport figures, including [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Bob Lutz]]. The event has attracted participants from throughout the world, including South America, Australia, Japan, and Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6506">The '''collapse of the Royal Plaza Hotel''' occurred on 13 August 1993 in the city of [[Nakhon Ratchasima]] (Khorat) in Thailand, killing 137 people and injuring 227. Taking just less than 10 seconds, the building collapsed and transformed the 6-storey complex into a pile of rubble, leaving only the front elevator hall which was separately built from the rest of the structure.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;

It is considered to be one of the most fatal and disastrous man-made accidents in Thai history.

== Background ==
The Royal Plaza Hotel, in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand, was hosting two conference meetings at the moment when the collapse occurred.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; At the time of the collapse, there were 379 people in the building. Of these, 117 were government officials from the [[Ministry of Education (Thailand)|Education Ministry]], who were attending a seminar in Benchamas Room on the second floor, 59 were from the [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Company]] on the fourth floor in Pikul-Chuanchom Room, and 78 were general hotel clients. The rest of the 125 victims were hotel staff.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt;

== Cause ==
The main reason for the collapse was the addition of floors without properly considering the strength of the structure and soil stability. The original permit, issued in 1983, was for a three-storey building with one underground floor and later during 1985 local authorities approved conversion of the building to a hotel but construction permission was not officially sought for the three additional floors until 1990. There were many errors including not strengthening foundations and columns, and not assessing the strength of the existing columns which later culminated in one of the worst building tragedies of Thailand.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt;

== Aftermath ==

=== Investigation ===
On 15 August 1993, two days after the incident, the [[Civil Engineering]] Chapter of the [[Engineering Institute of Thailand]] (EIT) immediately established a technical investigation group to support the Task Force at the site.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; The investigation mainly focused on solving two conundrums:

#Why did the building last for three years after the additional floors were added? The conclusion agreed by all of the investigating department about the cause of the collapse was unsatisfactory structure after the additional floors; however, instead of collapsing instantly, the building lasted firmly for 3 years.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; 
#The factors that triggered the collapse of the building, since none of the typical factors causing building collapses (e.g. earthquake, building misuse) were apparent.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt;

Criminal charges were filed against fifteen people, including the hotel owner and management, engineers and municipal officials.&lt;ref name="thairath"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thairath.co.th/content/region/103549|title=17 ปี ย้อนรอยโศกนาฏกรรม ร.ร.รอยัลพลาซ่า โคราช|newspaper=Thai Rath Online|date=14 August 2010|accessdate=20 November 2013|language=Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only engineer Bampen Panratissara was found guilty by the Supreme Court, and sentenced in 2003 to 37 years in prison.&lt;ref name="nation"/&gt;

=== Compensation ===
In 2009, the Nakhon Ratchasima [[Court of Appeals]] charged five defendants for 152.23 million baht as compensation to the companies and the victims' families who suffered from this disaster that killed 137 people.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nation"/&gt; These five defendants include Nakhon Ratchasima [[Municipality]], Wongsinthai Limited Partnership, the Royal Plaza hotel owner Amorn Janrattanaprada, engineer Sathorn Promnin, and design-and-construction supervising engineer Bampen Panratissara.&lt;ref name="nation"&gt;{{cite news|title=Court orders five to pay Bt152 million compensation for Korat Hotel collapse|newspaper=The Nation|date=7 March 2009|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2009/03/05/national/national_30097253.php|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5950">Since 2001, several cases of '''detention and search of Indian VIPs at US airports''' have been reported, resulting in diplomatic tensions between India and the United States. Protest from Indian authorities often led to apologies from US officials. Unlike the United States, India frequently exempts diplomats and other well-known figures from airport security checks.&lt;ref name="hsp" /&gt;

Bollywood superstar [[Shah Rukh Khan]] was at the centre of three well-publicised incidents. On 15 August 2009, he was detained at [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark]] while on his way to celebrate [[Independence Day (India)|India's Independence Day]] in Chicago.&lt;ref name="srk09"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/15/AR2009081501595.html |title=Indian Actor's Questioning at Airport Draws Criticism|first=Emily|last=Wax|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=16 August 2009|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, he was stopped at [[Westchester County Airport|New York White Plains]] where he had landed to address a conference at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name="srk12"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Shah-Rukh-Khans-detention-US-apologises-India-talks-tough/articleshow/12648019.cms |title=Shah Rukh Khan's detention: US apologises, India talks tough|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=13 April 2012|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later again, he was stopped at Los Angeles International Airport. &lt;ref name="ti20160812"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Shah-Rukh-Khan-detained-at-Los-Angeles-airport/articleshow/53662583.cms |title=Shah Rukh Khan detained at Los Angeles airport|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=12 August 2016|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, Indian Ambassador to the United States [[Meera Shankar]] and to the United Nations [[Hardeep Singh Puri]] were both targeted by security agents in two separate incidents.&lt;ref name="ms"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11957943 |title=India's ambassador Meera Shankar frisked at US airport|publisher=[[BBC]] |date=9 December 2010|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hsp"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/8199063/Indian-UN-ambassador-detained-at-airport-for-refusing-to-remove-turban.html |title=Indian UN ambassador detained at airport for refusing to remove turban|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=13 December 2010|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, former President of India [[A.

In 2015, it was announced that a list of 2,000 Indian VIPs will be included in the US [[Global Entry]] programme, which warrants expedited clearance at US airports. The list was to include former Presidents and Prime Ministers, prominent industrialists and movie stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/us-airports-will-now-treat-2000-indians-as-vvips/1/473818.html |title=US airports will now treat 2,000 Indians as VVIPS|first=Abhishek |last=Bhalla |newspaper=[[India Today]]|date=15 September 2015|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4891">{{2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami}}
The [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], by far the worst disaster in the number of lives lost during peacetime [[Finland]], killed 179 Finns in [[Thailand]] and [[Sri Lanka]], and caused widespread public debate and investigations into the actions of Finnish officials who were claimed to have failed to help their citizens in the affected areas.

==Overview==
The undersea [[megathrust earthquake]] was 9.1 to 9.3 on the [[moment magnitude scale]] and struck the [[Indian Ocean]] off the western coast of northern [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]]. It occurred on 26 December 2004 at 00:58:50 [[UTC]] (07:58:50 local time in [[Jakarta]] and [[Bangkok]]).

==Finnish citizens in the affected regions==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
There were approximately 2300 Finnish citizens on package tours in Thailand, and 600 in Sri Lanka, at the time of the earthquake. The number of independent travellers has not been confirmed. By 31 May 2005, a total number of 179 Finns have been proclaimed dead as caused by the tsunami; as of October 2006, one adult and three children were still officially missing in the affected areas. One person went missing in Sri Lanka and 178 in Thailand. Eight Finnish casualties had resided in [[Phuket Province|Phuket]] island, and 170 in [[Khao Lak]] beach, which was the area in Thailand hardest hit by the catastrophe. 106 Finns went missing from the hotel [[Blue Village Pakarang]] in Khao Lak.

Among the dead were an executive from Finland's [[Pfizer]], Harriet Eckstein, and a popular rock and jazz musician, [[Aki Sirkesalo]]. Among those who escaped was the future [[President of Finland]], [[Sauli Niinistö]], who saved himself from the tsunami wave by climbing onto a lamppost with his two sons in Khao Lak.

==Finnish government officials' actions==
The Finnish government officials were heavily criticised for their slow response to help those citizens affected by the events. There were a high number of travellers in the affected areas in need of information on lost relatives, help to find travel documents to get back home, and generally in need to get evacuated in an organised manner. In Finland, thousands of relatives needed information regarding family members that may have been in the area. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received the most criticism, mostly by not providing enough emergency telephone services during [[Boxing Day]] and the days following.

One of the reasons for the government's slow response, as has been claimed, was the general lack of information about the situation, and the lack of readiness to organise evacuation efforts in politically stable foreign locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Foreign Minister Tuomioja Apologises for problems with telephone hotline| publisher = Helsingin Sanomat International Edition| date = 2004-12-29| url = http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Foreign+Minister+Tuomioja+apologises+for+problems+with+telephone+hotline/1101978109189| accessdate = 2006-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sweden]], the country in [[Europe]] with the highest number of casualties as a result of the tsunami, widespread criticism towards the government led to the resignations of top politicians, but these consequences didn't occur in Finland.

==Diver instructors in rescue efforts==
In response for the need to coordinate rescue and evacuation efforts for Finnish people in Thailand, a group of Finnish [[scuba diver]]s started collecting namelists of the ones missing and the ones in safe locations, and sending them as [[text message]]s to the homeland to be published in lists in the [http://www.sukellus.fi Sukellus.fi] website. This operation was led by entrepreneurs [[Janne Miikkulainen]] and Jani Mäkinen from Raya Divers, a [[scuba diving]] firm based in Phuket, and by internet entrepreneur Alex Nieminen and journalist Petri Ahoniemi in [[Helsinki]]. Miikkulainen, Mäkinen and a crew of tourist agents also circulated hospitals and evacuation centers around Khao Lak and Phuket in order to find Finnish people and give them information about the situation.

Janne Miikkulainen was awarded a Cross of Merit of the [[Order of the Lion of Finland]] for his work during and after the catastrophe. The others hosting the Sukellus.fi-website received a State information award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Fusion Festival''' is a [[music festival|music]] and [[arts festival]] with a [[counterculture|countercultural]] character. It takes place at a former military airport called [[Rechlin-Lärz Airfield|Müritz Airpark]] in [[Lärz]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], in northeastern [[Germany]]. The festival name is often depicted in [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] letters as '''Фузион''', but pronounced like the English word [[wikt:fusion|fusion]] [{{IPA|'fjuʒən}}]. The annual festival was started by the ''Kulturkosmos'' organisation in 1997. It lasts four to six days, usually at the end of June. In 2016, the Fusion Festival event took place from June&amp;nbsp;29 - July 3, and which has attracted some 70,000 attendees for each year's festival, since the 2013 event, which the comparable American [[Burning Man]] event only matched in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youredm.com/2015/09/14/arrests-at-burning-man-2015-up-600-from-previous-year/ |title=Arrests at Burning Man 2015 up 600% from previous year |last1=Meadow |first1=Matthew |date=September 14, 2015 |website=youredm.com |publisher=YourEDM |access-date=August 7, 2016 |quote=The event has come under scrutiny in recent years for its "radical self-reliance" principle, considering the sheer number of participants at the event is growing every year, and was expected to have reached nearly 70,000 this year.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different musical styles are represented at the festival, but the line up is not released beforehand. Mostly [[electronic music]] is present, but there is no stylistic restriction for the various live music acts, and the festival attendees may bring their own instruments. 
The festival also holds its own film festival and features different scales of art installations. Attendees may bring their own art and appear in artistic costumes. Only vegetarian food is sold at the festival grounds.

The festival gears to create a [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]] and a [[Transformational festival|transformational]] environment. Due to its [[Avantgarde|avantgardistic]] attitude and the variety of art, the Fusion Festival has been described as a "European Burning Man".&lt;ref name=fest300&gt;{{cite web|title=Fusion Festival|url=https://www.fest300.com/festivals/fusion-festival|publisher=fest300 Review of Fusion Festival|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==

The '''Fusion Festival''' combines all styles of the underground electronic music scene and various other styles, sometimes depending on the attendees who choose to play their own music.&lt;ref name=fest300 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://berlin-enjoy.com/10-great-german-festivals-in-2014/ Review: "10 Great German Dance Festivals in 2014" on 'Berlin Enjoy']"&lt;/ref&gt; It is described as a space people go to free their minds from their everyday lives, jobs, studies and other responsibilities. It is the result of the search for an alternative through music, to the system "people are forced to live in". People go to the Fusion to experience a different way of socializing and living, where experiencing one another freely, sharing love for music and art connects different scenes and minds. It is a [[Naturism|clothing-optional]] event. Art installations include [[performance arts]], static artworks, sculptures, [[art car]]s and various other forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulturkosmos.de/en/history/ Historical backgrounds and intentions of the Kulturskosmos organisation]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Festival site ==
[[File:Fusion-tanzwueste-2014.png|thumb|''Dancing Desert'' installation at Fusion Festival 2014]]

Fusion Festival began in 1997 near the city of Lärz&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.kulturkosmos.de/en/kulturkosmos/ Information on Kulturkosmos site]"&lt;/ref&gt; in north-eastern Germany, about {{Convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Berlin and {{Convert|230|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?473758 Review of Fusion Festival on "Resident Advisor"]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The location is on the original grass-covered grounds of the disused ''Erprobungsstelle Rechlin'' Third Reich-era central military experimental airfield (at {{Coord|53|20|48.11|N|12|44|23.25|E}} for the 234-hectare area central field) about {{Convert|4.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} due north of the modern [[Rechlin-Lärz Airfield]] facility. The site was first acquired by the [[German Empire]] in 1916 as an aviation research and training ground, opening the facility for use by the ''[[Luftstreitkräfte]]'' in August 1918. After the establishment of the [[Luftwaffe]] in 1935, the field served as the ''Erprobungsstelle Rechlin'' central military aircraft test facility of the Third Reich through early 1945, and it was captured by the Soviet Red Army on May 2, 1945, for use by the [[Soviet Air Force|VVS]]. There are grass-covered concrete hangars (actual bunkers) from that time that were used for Soviet fighter aircraft (hence the Cyrillic transliteration of the festival name and various stages, as many Cyrillic inscriptions were still present on the site). The airfield was reopened for civilian use in 1994 and sold to the ''Müritz Airpark Group'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mueritz-airpark.de/en/airport/history/ History of the Müritz Airpark]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glenn Dennis''' (March 24, 1925 – April 28, 2015) was a founder of the International UFO Museum and Research Center in [[Roswell, New Mexico]], which opened in September 1991, and self-professed witness to the 1947 [[Roswell UFO incident]].&lt;ref name=GDENNIS&gt;{{cite web| title = Roswell Files: Glenn Dennis| url=http://www.roswellfiles.com/Witnesses/glenndennis.htm | accessdate = 2008-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glenn Dennis, Roswell Undertaker, Obituary, Roswell Daily Record, May 5, 2015|url=http://www.theblackvault.com/casefiles/glenn-dennis-roswell-undertaker-obituary-roswell-daily-record-may-5-2015/#|website=The Blackvault|publisher=Roswell Daily Record|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Dennis began working as a part-time assistant in the Ballard Funeral Home in 1940 while still attending [[Roswell High School (New Mexico)|Roswell High School]]. After graduation, Dennis was excused from wartime military service because of poor hearing, and commenced an apprenticeship as an [[embalmer]] at Ballard.  He graduated from the ''San Francisco College of Mortuary Science'' on 22 December 1946 and was put in charge of Ballard's military contract, which included ambulance and mortuary services for the nearby [[Roswell Army Air Field]] (RAAF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1430/is_n8_v17/ai_17596047 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roswell incident==
Dennis came to the attention of [[UFO]] researchers in 1989 when he called the hotline after an episode of ''Unsolved Mysteries'' featured the [[Roswell UFO incident]]. He was the first witness to confirm claims of alien bodies at the Roswell base itself.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Analysis of testimony==
Dennis’ accounts featured prominently in ''Crash at Corona'' published in 1992 and ''The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell'', published in 1994, as well other pro-UFO books, but serious doubts about his story were soon raised. For some, like Karl Pflock and [[Kevin Randle]], these inconsistencies were great enough to discount Dennis’ credibility entirely.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Several researchers, including Karl Pflock, investigated Dennis’s claims and found a number of inconsistencies, including the identity of a nurse who Dennis claimed was a witness to the alleged alien autopsies and the need for Dennis's own involvement in any embalming process when qualified pathologists were said to have performed the autopsies. Pflock also questioned the validity of sketches of aliens provided by Dennis.&lt;ref name=pflock&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Pflock
 | first = Karl T.
 | title = Roswell: Inconvenient Facts and the Will to Believe
 | year = 2001
 | publisher = Prometheus Books, Amherst, New York
 | isbn = 1-57392-894-1
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dennis's account is repeated in ''Witness to Roswell: Unmasking the 60-Year Cover-Up'' by Thomas Carey and Donald Schmitt, published in 2007. Regarding Dennis providing researchers with a false name, they write, "His surprising and disappointing response was,... 'I gave you a phony name, because I promised her that I would never reveal it to anyone'." The authors then comment that "Dennis was found to have knowingly provided false information to investigators, and must technically stand impeached as a witness." However, the book also notes that other witnesses "have told us that Dennis had told them about the phone calls for child-sized caskets way back when it happened" and that "Dennis had told them about his run-in at the base hospital long before Roswell became a household word." &lt;ref&gt;Carey &amp; Schmitt, 135&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacques Aymar-Vernay''' (born in 1662) was a stonemason from the village of [[Saint-Marcellin, Isère|Saint Marcellin]] in [[Dauphiné]], [[France]], who reintroduced [[dowsing]] with a [[divining rod]] into popular usage in [[Europe]]. He claimed to have discovered springs and treasures hiding in the earth using his rod, and even tracked down criminals using it. According to some accounts, when he neared the scene of a murder using a divining rod, he would break into a sweat, shudder, and in some instances, even faint.

In 1692, Aymar-Vernay was hired by authorities to locate a murderer. By swinging a [[pendulum]] he identified a 19-year-old boy, a [[Kyphosis|hunchback]], as the culprit. The boy was subsequently "[[breaking wheel|broken on the wheel]]" (tortuously executed).&lt;ref name="flimflam"&gt;{{cite book

'''''Lightnin'''''' is a comedy play in three acts by [[Winchell Smith]] and [[Frank Bacon (actor)|Frank Bacon]]. The play was produced by [[John Golden]] and directed by P. E. McCoy. With Frank Bacon in the lead role and billed as “A Live Wire American Comedy”, ''Lightnin' '' made its Broadway debut on August 26, 1918, at the [[Gaiety Theatre (New York City)|Gaiety Theatre]] and played continuously over three seasons with a [[List of Broadway shows that have held the title of longest-running show|record breaking run]] of 1,291 performances. The show began its long national tour at the end of August 1921 and continued on for some time after Bacon’s death in November 1922. ''Lightnin' '' was revived in 1938 for a two-month run at the [[John Golden Theatre]] with [[Fred Stone]] playing Lightnin’ Bill Jones and was adapted for cinema twice in films starring [[Jay Hunt (director)|Jay Hunt]] (1925) and [[Will Rogers]] (1930).&lt;ref name= "NYT"&gt;''Lightnin''' Flashes A Hit At The Gaiety.

==Plot==
The story takes place in the mythical town of Calivada where Lightnin' Bill Jones, or more correctly his wife, operates a rather seedy hotel that straddles the California-Nevada state line convenient for those looking for a quick Nevada divorce. He is nicknamed Lightnin’ because, as the local postmaster put it, “We call him Lightnin’ because he ain’t.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jB4wAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22Lightnin%27+Bill+Jones&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Vu0xUpWqOOKdiALqw4DAAw&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Lightnin%27%20Bill%20Jones&amp;f=false Bacon, Frank - ''Lightnin'', 1920, p. 1] Retrieved September 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Lightnin’ Bill, a Civil War veteran known to brag that he advised General [[Ulysses S. Grant]], also claims to be a jack of all trades, having been at one time or another, a judge, inventor, detective and bee keeper. Of the latter profession he spins the tale that he once drove a swarm across the prairie in the midst of winter without the loss of a single bee. When pressed Lightnin’ Bill concedes that during the drive he may have been stung once or twice.&lt;ref name= "Everybody's"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_XA4AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=lightnin+synopsis+%22frank+bacon%22+old+liar+-lightning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2XIuUoeOOYSjiAKK1YDIBg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=lightnin%20synopsis%20%22frank%20bacon%22%20old%20liar%20-lightning&amp;f=false ''Everybody's Magazine,'' vol. 40, January 1919, p.43] Retrieved September 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Lightnin’ Bill likes to spend his days and nights carousing with cronies rather than being at home with his wife and adopted daughter. When he refuses to go along with the sale of the hotel to group of out-of-town businessmen, his wife becomes furious and files for divorce. In court Lightnin’ Bill, with the help of young John Marvin, is able to prove that the buyers are unscrupulous scoundrels and wins back the love of his wife.&lt;ref name= "NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Everybody's" /&gt;

The holiday is observed during Holy Week as part of the Paschal Triduum on the Friday preceding Easter Sunday, and may coincide with the Jewish observance of Passover. It is also known as Holy Friday, Great Friday, Black Friday, or Easter Friday, though the last term properly refers to the Friday in Easter week.

;Pastafarian
* Holiday: Around the time of Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa (generally known as the [[Christmas and holiday season]]), Pastafarians celebrate a vaguely defined holiday named "Holiday". Holiday does not take place on a specific date so much as it is the Holiday season itself. There are no specific requirements for Holiday, and Pastafarians celebrate Holiday however they please. They also celebrate Pastover and Ramendan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pastafarians.org.au/pastafarianism/holidays/|title=Holy days|date=2013-12-08|work=Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster Australia|access-date=2017-12-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Religion
{{main|Lists of holidays#Religious holidays}}
Many religions whose holidays were formulated before the worldwide spread of the [[Gregorian calendar]] have been assigned to dates according to either their own internal religious calendar, moon cycles, or otherwise. Even within Christianity, [[Easter]] is a movable feast and Christmas is celebrated according to the older [[Julian calendar]] instead of the Gregorian by some sects of the religion.

'''[[medication|Drugs]]''' or medicines may be '''withdrawn''' from commercial markets because of risks to patients, but also because of commercial reasons (e.g. lack of demand and relatively high production costs). Where risks or harms is the reason for withdrawal, this will usually have been prompted by unexpected adverse effects that were not detected during Phase III [[clinical trials]], i.e. they were only made apparent from [[postmarketing surveillance]] data collected from the wider community over longer periods of time.

This list is not limited to drugs that were ever approved by the FDA. Some of them (lumiracoxib, rimonabant, tolrestat, ximelagatran and ximelidine, for example) were approved to be marketed in Europe but had not yet been approved for marketing in the US, when side effects became clear and their developers pulled them from the market. Some drugs in this list (e.g. LSD) were never approved for marketing in the US or Europe.

The '''Lyceum Theatre''' (pronounced ly-CEE-um) is a 2,100-seat [[West End theatre]] located in the [[City of Westminster]], on Wellington Street, just off the [[Strand, London|Strand]].  The origins of the theatre date to 1765. Managed by [[Samuel James Arnold|Samuel Arnold]], from 1794 to 1809 the building hosted a variety of entertainments including a circus produced by [[Philip Astley]], a chapel, and the first London [[Wax museum|exhibition of waxworks]] displayed by [[Madame Tussaud]]. From 1816 to 1830, it served as '''The English Opera House'''. After a fire, the house was rebuilt and reopened on 14 July 1834 to a design by [[Samuel Beazley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/art/architecture/classical/3.html The Victorian Web]&lt;/ref&gt; The building was unique in that it has a balcony overhanging the dress circle. It was built by the partnership of [[Samuel Morton Peto|Peto &amp; Grissell]]. The theatre then played opera, adaptations of [[Charles Dickens]] novels and [[James Planché]]'s "fairy extravaganzas", among other works.

From 1871 to 1902, [[Henry Irving]] appeared at the theatre in, especially, [[Shakespeare]], usually starring opposite [[Ellen Terry]]. In 1904 the theatre was almost completely rebuilt and richly ornamented in [[Rococo]] style by [[Bertie Crewe]], but it retained Beazley's [[façade]] and grand [[portico]]. It played mostly [[melodrama]] over the ensuing decades. The building closed in 1939 and was set to be demolished, but it was saved and converted into a [[Mecca Leisure Group|Mecca]] Ballroom in 1951, styled the '''Lyceum Ballroom''', where many well-known bands played. The Lyceum was closed in 1986 but restored to theatrical use in 1996 by Holohan Architects.&lt;ref&gt;Earl and Sells (2000), pp. 123–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1999, the theatre has hosted ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]''.

==History==

===Early years===
In 1765, a building was erected on an adjacent site by the architect James Payne for the exhibitions of The Society of Artists, which disbanded three years later when the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] succeeded it. The building was then leased out for dances and other entertainments, including musical entertainments by [[Charles Dibdin]]. Famed actor [[David Garrick]] also performed there. In 1794, the composer [[Samuel Arnold (composer)|Samuel Arnold Sr]] rebuilt the interior of the building, making it into a proper theatre, but through the opposition of the existing [[patent theatre]]s, he was not granted a patent. Therefore, he leased it to other entertainments again, including [[Philip Astley]], who brought his circus there when his [[Astley's Amphitheatre|amphitheatre]] was burned down at Westminster. It was also used as a chapel, a concert room, and for the first London [[Wax museum|exhibition of waxworks]] displayed by [[Madame Tussauds]] in 1802.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, W. Macqueen and Ronald Mayes. [http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/LyceumTheatre.htm "The Lyceum Theatre, Wellington Street, London"], Arthur Lloyd, accessed 16 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre finally became a [[Patent theatre|licensed]] house in 1809, and until 1812 it was used for dramatic performances by the Drury Lane Company after the burning of their own [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|theatre]], until the erection of the new edifice. It staged one of the earliest [[tableaux vivants]], as part of William Dimond's ''The Peasant Boy'' in 1811.&lt;ref name=Altick&gt;{{cite book|last1=Altick|first1=Richard|title=The Shows of London|date=1878|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816, Samuel Arnold rebuilt the house to a design by Beazley and opened it as The English Opera House, but it was destroyed by fire in 1830. The house was famous for hosting the London première of [[Mozart]]'s opera ''[[Così fan tutte]]'' (9 May 1811)&lt;ref name="Londontown profile of the theatre"&gt;[http://www.londontown.com/LondonInformation/Entertainment/Lion_King_-_Lyceum_Theatre/04ff/ Londontown profile of the theatre]&lt;/ref&gt; and as the first theatre in Britain to have its stage lit by gas (6 August 1817).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theatres Compete in Race to Install Gas Illumination – 1817|url=http://www.overthefootlights.co.uk/1817-18.pdf|work=Over The Footlights|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the "[[Beefsteak Club|Sublime Society of Beef Steaks]],"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sublimesocietyofbeefsteaks.org/ History of the Sublime Society of Beef Steaks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512123242/http://sublimesocietyofbeefsteaks.org/ |date=12 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been founded in 1735 by theatre manager Henry Rich, had its home at the theatre for over 50 years until 1867. The members, who never exceeded twenty-four in number, met every Saturday night to eat beefsteaks and drink port wine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aps.uoguelph.ca/~swatland/rep239nr.htm Information about the Sublime Society of Beefsteaks]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834, the present house opened slightly to the west, with a frontage on Wellington Street,&lt;ref&gt;Wellington Street was a new thoroughfare constructed between [[Waterloo Bridge]] and [[Bow Street]]. The former site became an unsuccessful arcade, which was demolished to build the [[Strand Musick Hall]] (sic), another unsuccessful venture. In 1868, the auditorium was rebuilt and it reopened as the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]].&lt;/ref&gt; under the name '''Theatre Royal Lyceum and English Opera House'''. The theatre was again designed by Beazley and cost £40,000.  The new house championed English opera rather than the Italian operas that had played earlier in the century.&lt;ref name=Ivanhoe&gt;Gordon-Powell, Robin. ''Ivanhoe'', full score, Introduction, vol.

VII, 2008, The Amber Ring&lt;/ref&gt; Composer [[John Barnett]] produced a number of works in the first few years of the theatre, including ''[[The Mountain Sylph]]'' (1834), credited as the first modern English [[opera]]. It was followed by ''Fair Rosamund'' in 1837 and ''Farinelli'' in 1839 (both at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]),&lt;ref name=Ivanhoe/&gt; and ''Blanche of Jersey'' here in 1840.  In 1841–43, composer [[Michael William Balfe]] managed the theatre and produced National Opera here, but the venture was ultimately unsuccessful. From 1844 to 1847 the theatre was managed by husband and wife team [[Robert Keeley (comedian)|Robert Keeley]] and [[Mary Anne Keeley]], during which period the house became associated with adaptations of [[Charles Dickens]]'s novels and Christmas books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/theaters/pva234.html Summary of the theatre's history]&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, an adaptation of Dickens' ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'' ran for over 100 performances from 1844–45 here, a long run for the time.

The Lyceum was later managed by Madame [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris]] and [[Charles James Mathews]] from 1847–55, who produced [[James Planché]]'s "[fairy] extravaganzas" featuring spectacular stage effects.  Their first big success was [[John Maddison Morton]]'s ''[[Box and Cox (farce)|Box and Cox]]''.  [[Tom Taylor]]'s adaptation of ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', with Dickens himself as consultant, played in 1860, shortly after end of its serialisation and volume publication.  [[Charles Fechter]], who managed the theatre from 1863–67 also favored spectacular productions. In 1866, [[Dion Boucicault]]'s ''The Long Strike'' (his adaptation of [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s Manchester novels ''Mary Barton'' and ''Lizzie Leigh'') was produced here.  [[Ethel Lavenu]], the mother and grandmother of actors [[Tyrone Power, Sr.]] and [[Tyrone Power]] performed in a number pieces at the theatre in the 1860s.  [[W. S. Gilbert]] produced three plays here. In 1863, his first professional play, ''Uncle Baby'', premièred.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther (2011), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1867, he presented his Christmas [[pantomime]], called ''[[Harlequin Cock Robin and Jenny Wren]]'', and in 1884, he produced the drama ''Comedy and Tragedy''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gilbertandsullivanarchive.org/gilbert/plays/harlequin/times1867.html "Lyceum Theatre",] ''The Times'', 27 December 1867; Howarth, Paul.

In 1889, the world's finest Italian dramatic tenor, [[Francesco Tamagno]], appeared at the Lyceum, singing the leading role in the first London production of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Otello]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Irving years===
[[File:Henry Irving portrait.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Henry Irving|Sir Henry Irving]]]]
Beginning in 1871, under manager [[Hezekiah Linthicum Bateman]] and his wife, [[Henry Irving]] appeared at the theatre in, among other things, many [[Shakespeare]] works. Irving began with the French [[melodrama]] ''[[The Bells (play)|The Bells]]'', an instant hit in which he played the ghost-haunted burgomaster. The piece ran to sell-out crowds for 150 nights, which was an unusually long run at the time.  ''Charles I'', in 1872 was another hit, running for 180 nights. In 1874, Irving played ''[[Hamlet]]'' at the theatre, perhaps his greatest triumph, running for 200 nights.  In 1878, after Bateman's death, Irving took over management of the theatre from his widow. ''The Builder'', 28 September 1878 reported that there was a difference between Irving and Mrs. Bateman regarding the personnel of the company at the Lyceum.  "Mr. Irving is said to have told Mrs. Bateman that he was resolved to have actors to act with him, and not dolls, otherwise he would no longer play at the Lyceum. The result was that Mrs. Bateman threw up the management of the theatre, and Mr. Irving takes her place."  Mrs. Bateman became the manager of [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theirvingsociety.org.uk/landlord.htm Description of ownership of the Lyceum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614112443/http://www.theirvingsociety.org.uk/landlord.htm |date=14 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irving continued to star in plays there, especially Shakespeare, until 1902, engaging co-star [[Ellen Terry]] for that entire period of 24 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/collections/object.php?object_id=343 Description of the Terry and Irving partnership and link to further information about Terry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050504212410/http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/collections/object.php?object_id=343 |date=4 May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bram Stoker]] worked between 1878 and 1898 as business manager of the theatre, and Irving was Stoker's real-life inspiration for the character [[Count Dracula]] in his 1897 novel, ''[[Dracula]]''. Stoker hoped that Irving, with his dramatic, sweeping gestures, gentlemanly mannerisms, and speciality in playing villain roles, would play Dracula in the stage adaptation of his novel. However, Irving never agreed to appear in the stage version, although the play was produced at the Lyceum.

Irving and Terry began with ''[[Hamlet]]'' in 1878. Their  1879 production of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' ran for an unusual 250 nights, and success followed success in the Shakespeare canon as well as in other major plays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/ACterry.htm Information from Schoolnet.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030232953/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/ACterry.htm |date=30 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other  celebrated productions included ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6162 Information from Findagrave.com]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Lady of Lyons]]'' by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] (1878), ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[King Lear]]'', ''The Lyons Mail'' by Charles Reade (1883), the immensely popular ''Faust'' by William Gorman Wills (1885, which even drew applications for reserved seats from foreigners), ''[[Macbeth]]'' (1888, with incidental music by Sir [[Arthur Sullivan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gilbertandsullivanarchive.org/sullivan/macbeth/index.html "Sullivan's incidental music to Shakespeare's ''Macbeth''], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 28 January 2005, accessed 21 August 2016; Hugill, Robert.

When Irving and Terry toured America, as they did several times beginning in 1883, the theatre played works with many famous actors including [[Johnston Forbes-Robertson]], [[Mrs. Patrick Campbell]], [[Sarah Bernhardt]] and [[Eleonora Duse]].  Martin Harvey, a pupil of Irving's played a season there in 1899. [[Benoît-Constant Coquelin]] appeared as [[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]] in the summer of 1898.

===Later years===
[[File:KingArthurS.jpg|right|thumb|''King Arthur'' at the theatre, 1895]]
After being bought by [[Thomas Barrasford]], in 1904 the theatre was rebuilt and richly ornamented in [[rococo]] style by [[Bertie Crewe]], retaining only the façade and portico of the original building. The theatre presented [[music hall]] and [[Variety (magazine)|variety]], in an attempt to compete with the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] and the new Stoll built [[Coliseum Theatre|London Coliseum]], but this was not a success, and the theatre soon returned to presenting drama. From 1909–38 the Melville Brothers ran a successful series of spectacular melodramas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uklondontheatretickets.com/lyceumtheatre.html Profile of the theatre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207093150/http://www.uklondontheatretickets.com/lyceumtheatre.html |date=7 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, additional minor alterations to the theatre were made by Edward Jones. Between the wars, dramas played at the theatre for ten months each year, followed by Christmas pantomimes, including ''Queen of Hearts'' in 1938. The Lyceum was the last London theatre to continue the early practice of concluding pantomimes with a [[harlequinade]], a free standing entertainment of slapstick clowning, juggling and tumbling. The tradition ended with the closure of the theatre in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com/development.html ''The Development of Pantomime'' (It's Behind You!)] accessed 17 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, the [[London County Council]] bought the building, with plans to demolish it to make room for road improvement. The theatre closed that year with a landmark performance of ''Hamlet'' directed by Sir [[John Gielgud]] (Ellen Terry's great nephew).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lyceum Theatre – 'Hamlet' by William Shakespeare|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=29 June 1939|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The road improvement plans collapsed, and after the war, in 1945, it was converted to a huge ballroom and reopened by Matthews and Sons, as the '''Lyceum Ballroom'''. The [[Miss World]] contest was staged at the venue every year from 1951 to 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missworld.com/History/1951/ "1951"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130411085310/http://www.missworld.com/History/1951/ |date=11 April 2013 }}, Miss World pageant, accessed 12 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Many big bands played here, including the [[Oscar Rabin Band]] which performed frequently. In the 1960s and 1970s, the theatre was used as a pop concert venue and for television broadcasts. [[The Grateful Dead]], [[The Groundhogs]], [[The Clash]], [[Bob Marley and the Wailers]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[The Police]], [[The Who]], [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]], [[Colosseum (band)|Colosseum]], [[U2]], [[The Smiths]] and [[Culture Club]] all played here.&lt;ref name="Londontown profile of the theatre"/&gt; Bob Marley and the Wailers recorded their ''[[Live! (Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers album)|Live!]]'' album here on 18–19 July 1975. [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] filmed a performance there in May 1980 for broadcast on the ''[[Old Grey Whistle Test]]''. This footage appears on the 2007 CD/DVD re-release of their 1980 album ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]''.

[[File:Lyceum Theatre 2.jpg|thumb|left|Side view of the theatre in 2006, with red ''Lion King'' displays visible]]
A proposed redevelopment of [[Covent Garden]] by the [[Greater London Council|GLC]] in 1968 saw the theatre under threat, together with the nearby [[Vaudeville Theatre|Vaudeville]], [[Garrick Theatre|Garrick]], [[Adelphi Theatre|Adelphi]] and [[Duchess Theatre|Duchess theatre]]s. An active campaign by [[British Actors' Equity Association|Equity]], the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]], and theatre owners under the auspices of the ''Save London Theatres Campaign'' led to the abandonment of the scheme.&lt;ref name=Vaud&gt;&lt;cite&gt;[http://www.vaudevilletheatre.org.uk/ Vaudeville Theatre] accessed 28 March 2007&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, the theatre gained protection and was [[listed building|Grade II* listed]] as ''Interior despite adaptation and alteration for present ballroom use retains [a] substantial part of Crewe's work''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&amp;id=207546 English Heritage listing details] accessed 27 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre went dark in 1986, after the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre's]] promenade performances (in 1985) of [[Bill Bryden]]'s adaptation of the ''[[The Mysteries (play)|Mysteries]]'' trilogy. Brent Walker leased the theatre during this time but later gave up his lease, and in 1996 it was restored and reconverted into a theatre for large-scale musicals or opera (with a suitably large orchestra pit) by Holohan Architects.  A production of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' played from 1996 to 1998.

The theatre has been home to the [[musical theatre]] version of ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'' since 1999.  To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the production, which has grossed over £289 million and been seen by more than eight million people, 250 former cast members gathered onstage, together with designer-director [[Julie Taymor]].  Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] and actor [[James Earl Jones]], who voiced the role of King Mufasa in the original Disney animated film, attended the performance.&lt;ref&gt;Cavendish, Dominic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8337">'''Mankjur''' or '''Minkajur al-Farghani''' ({{lang-ar|منكجور الفرغاني}}) or '''al-Ushrusani''' ({{lang-ar|منكجور الأشروسني}}) was a 9th-century [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] or [[Iranian people|Iranian]] military officer in the service of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. He was a cousin of the prominent Abbasid general [[Khaydhar ibn Kawus al-Afshin]], thus belonging to the [[Principality of Ushrusana|ruling family of Ushrusana]]. Mankjur accompanied al-Afshin in his campaign against the [[Khurramite]] [[Babak Khorramdin]], and was later appointed as governor of [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Adharbayjan]] by him in 837. However, in 839, Mankjur, after refusing to give the [[caliph]] [[al-Mu'tasim]] some of Babak's booty, revolted against him. Al-Mu'tasim responded by sending against him [[Bugha al-Kabir]], who managed to suppress his revolt and imprison him in [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]]. The affair of Mankjur raised suspicions about the loyalty of the al-Afshin, who was accused of encouraging the revolt, and contributed to the general's own downfall in the following year.

== Name and background ==
Mankjur's [[Nisba (onomastics)|''nisbah'']] is given variously by the sources as ''al-Ushrusani'' or ''al-Farghani'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Tabari|1991|p=175}}; {{harvnb|Al-Ya'qubi|1883|p=583}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively indicating an origin from the [[Central Asia]]n provinces of [[Osrushana|Ushrusana]] or [[Fergana|Farghana]]. Historian [[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]] believed that the first element of Mankjur's name may have been a corruption of the [[Turkic languages|Turkish]] "''ming/bing'' '1,000' or ''mengü'' 'eternal, everlasting,'" and that Mankjur may have been a Turkish slave soldier imported into Farghana prior to entering caliphal service.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Tabari|1991|loc=p. 175 n. 496}}. {{harvnb|Gordon|2001|loc=p. 208 n. 36}}, doubted that Mankjur's social status could be extrapolated from his name, as Turks were not only slave soldiers, but also likely members of the notable families in the eastern provinces.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Vladimir Minorsky]], the Mingechaur ford (now the [[Mingachevir reservoir]]) of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]] was named after Mankjur, who may have been active in the area during his time in Adharbayjan.{{sfn|Minorsky|1953|p=111}}

== Career ==
[[File:Adharbayjan Ninth Century.svg|thumb|250px|Map of Adharbayjan in the ninth century.]]
Mankjur was a kinsman of the Ushrusanan ruler al-Afshin, one of the leading military figures during the caliphate of [[al-Mu'tasim]] (r. 833–842); according to [[Ya'qubi|al-Ya'qubi]] he was the uncle of one of al-Afshin's sons. During al-Afshin's campaign against the [[Khurramites|Khurramite]] rebel [[Babak Khorramdin]] in Adharbayjan (835–837), Mankjur was dispatched by the general to fight against a separate revolt in [[Warthan]]. In 837, following the victory over Babak, Mankjur was appointed by al-Afshin to serve as his resident governor of Adharbayjan, while al-Afshin himself departed the province and returned to Samarra.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Tabari|1991|p=175}}, who only notes that Mankjur was a kinsman of al-Afshin, without specifying the exact nature of the relationship; {{harvnb|Al-Ya'qubi|1883|pp=579-80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], Mankjur was believed to have acted in a corrupt manner during his governorship, appropriating for himself a large sum of money hidden away by Babak rather than forwarding it to the caliph. His alleged activities were soon revealed by the [[Barid (caliphate)|postmaster]] of Adharbayjan, who wrote to al-Mu'tasim and informed him about the money. Mankjur immediately wrote to the caliph in response, calling the accusation a lie, and the dispute between him and the postmaster quickly escalated. Mankjur eventually decided to kill the postmaster, but the latter sought refuge in [[Ardabil]], prompting Mankjur to attack the city in retaliation.{{sfn|Al-Tabari|1991|pp=175-76}}

News of these events reached al-Mu'tasim, who responded by ordering al-Afshin to send someone to dismiss Mankjur. Al-Afshin accordingly dispatched [[Abi'l-Saj Devdad]] to the province, but allegations began to circulate that al-Afshin was in fact secretly supporting Mankjur, and al-Mu'tasim decided to send [[Bugha al-Kabir]] to fight Mankjur instead. Mankjur now came out openly in rebellion, but was soon defeated on the field and forced to retreat. He then rebuilt a mountain fortress which had been destroyed by Babak and fortified himself in it, relying on the mountain's inaccessibility to defend him. Despite this, his rebellion came to an end less than a month later; varying accounts state that he was either betrayed by his men and handed over to the caliphal army, or that he received a guarantee of safe conduct from Bugha. In any case, he was brought back by Bugha to Samarra, where al-Mu'tasim ordered him to be thrown into prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Tabari|1991|pp=176, 178}}, who does not name the general that defeated Mankjur, but names Bugha as the one that transported him to Samarra; {{harvnb|Al-Ya'qubi|1883|pp=583-84}}; {{harvnb|Madelung|1988|p=718}}; {{harvnb|Mottahedeh|1975|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mankjur's rebellion proved damaging to the reputation of al-Afshin, who was suspected of secretly corresponding with Mankjur and encouraging him to revolt. This belief, combined with other accusations of treason against the caliph, ultimately resulted in al-Afshin being arrested in 840 for conspiring against the state, and led to his imprisonment and death in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Tabari|1991|pp=180 ff., esp. 182 &amp; 197}}; {{harvnb|Al-Ya'qubi|1883|pp=583-84}}; {{harvnb|Gordon|2001|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7650">The '''Megalesia''', '''Megalensia''', or '''Megalenses Ludi''', was a festival celebrated in [[Ancient Rome]] from April 4 to April 10, in honour of [[Cybele]], known to Romans as ''Magna Mater'' (Great Mother). The name of the festival derives from Greek ''Megale'' (μϵγάλη), meaning "Great". ''[[Ludi]]'' were the games or entertainments associated with religious festivals.

==Background==
Cybele's cult image was brought to Rome from [[Pessinus]] in 204 BC, along with the goddesses [[Galli]] priests. As the "Great Mother of the Gods" and a purported ancestral [[Troy|Trojan goddess]] of Rome's ruling [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] caste, she was recruited to act on Rome's behalf in the [[Second Punic War|war against Carthage]]. Her arrival was solemnized with a magnificent procession, sacred feasts (''[[Lectisternium|lectisternia]]''), games, and offerings to her at the [[temple of Victory]] on the [[Palatine Hill]], where her image was temporarily housed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]], ''On the Latin Language in 25 Books,'' vi. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 29#14|xxix.14]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Eugene, (Editor) ''Cybele, Attis, and Related Cults: Essays in Memory of M.J. Vermaseren'', Brill, 1996. pp. 393-394&lt;/ref&gt;
In 203 Cybele was promised a temple of her own. Games in her honour were celebrated in 193.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 34#54|xxxiv.54]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GoldDonahue2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Barbara K. Gold|author2=John F. Donahue|title=Roman Dining: A Special Issue of American Journal of Philology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_uYTKMorJFgC&amp;pg=PA102|date=13 May 2005|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8202-9|pages=102–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular annual celebration of the Megalesia began in 191, with the temple's completion and dedication by Marcus Junius Brutus&lt;ref&gt;Tribune of the plebs (195 BC), praetor (191 BC), and perhaps the consul of 178 BC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 36#36|xxxvi.36]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festival==
The ''Megalesia'' commenced on April 4, the anniversary of Cybele's arrival in Rome. The festival structure is unclear, but it included [[ludi scaenici]] (plays and other entertainments based on religious themes), probably performed on the deeply stepped approach to her temple; some of the plays were commissioned from well-known playwrights. On April 10, her image was taken in public procession to the [[Circus Maximus]], and [[chariot race]]s were held there in her honour. The racetrack could be seen from her temple's threshold, and a statue of Magna Mater was permanently sited on the racetrack's dividing barrier, showing the goddess seated on a lion's back: the goddess could thus watch the festivities held in her honour.&lt;ref&gt;It was probably copied from a Greek original; the same appears on the [[Pergamon Altar]]. See Roller, 1999, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chronography of 354 Mensis Aprilis.png|thumb|upright|Illustration of the month of April based on the [[Calendar of Filocalus]] (354 AD), perhaps either a Gallus or a theatrical performer for the Megalesia&lt;ref&gt;Michele Renee Salzman, ''On Roman Time: The Codex Calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity'' (University of California Press, 1990), pp. 83–91, rejecting the scholarly tradition that the image represents an old man in an unknown rite for Venus&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Roman bystanders seem to have perceived Megalesia as either characteristically "[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ritus graecus|Greek]]";&lt;ref&gt;In the late Republican era, [[Cicero]] describes the hymns and ritual characteristics of Megalensia as Greek. See Takacs, in Lane (ed), p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; or Phrygian. At the cusp of Rome's transition to Empire, the Greek [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] describes this procession as wild Phrygian "mummery" and "fabulous clap-trap", in contrast to the Megalesian sacrifices and games, carried out in what he admires as a dignified "traditional Roman" manner; Dionysius also applauds the wisdom of Roman religious law, which forbids the participation of any Roman citizen in the procession, and in the goddess's [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]];&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus, ''Roman Antiquities'', trans. Cary, Loeb, 1935, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/2A*.html 2, 19, 3 - 5.] See also commentary in Roller, 1999, p.293 and note 39: "... one can see how a Phrygian [priest] in an elaborately embroidered robe might have clashed noticeably with the plain, largely monochromatic Roman tunic and toga"; cf Augustus's "efforts to stress the white toga as the proper dress for Romans."&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves are forbidden to witness any of this.&lt;ref&gt;Roller, 1999, p. 296, citing Cicero,  ''De Haruspicum Responsis'', 13. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late republican era, [[Lucretius]] vividly describes the procession's armed "war dancers" in their three-plumed helmets, clashing their shields together, bronze on bronze,&lt;ref&gt;Recalling the Kouretes and Corybantes of Cybele's Greek myths and cults.&lt;/ref&gt; "delighted by blood"; yellow-robed, long-haired, perfumed Galli waving their knives, wild music of thrumming tympanons and shrill flutes. Along the route, rose petals are scattered, and clouds of incense arise.&lt;ref&gt;See Robertson, N., in Lane (ed), 1996, pp. 292 - 293. See also Summers, K., in Lane (ed), 1996, pp.341, 347 - 349.&lt;/ref&gt; The goddess's image, wearing the Mural Crown and seated within a sculpted, lion-drawn chariot, is carried high on a bier.&lt;ref&gt;Summers, in Lane, 1996, pp. 348 - 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman display of Cybele's Megalesia procession as an exotic, privileged public pageant offers signal contrast to what is known of the private, socially inclusive Phrygian-Greek mysteries on which it was based.&lt;ref&gt;Roller, 1999, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the festival, wealthy Roman nobles played host to each other, in rotation, in honour of the goddess; these were lavish, costly and competitive occasions in which the wealthy sought to impress their inferiors and peers; or in the latter case, to outdo them in extravagance. In direct response to this, the [[Roman senate|senate]] issued a decree in 161 BC, limiting expenditure on meat, wine and silverware for such feasts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Gellius|Gellius]], 24, 2 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Gellius/2*.html#24.2 Aulus Gellius, ''Noctes Atticae (Attic Nights)'', 24.2; Loeb, 1926 (revised 1946)] [accessed March 31, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late republican era, Cicero attacked his political opponent [[Publius Clodius Pulcher|Clodius]] for sacrilegious disruption of the ''casti, sollemnes, religiosi'' (pure, traditional, religious) rites of Megalesia. Clodius had sought popular support by defecting from a patrician to a plebeian gens. The Megalesia was a predominantly patrician affair; and in an apparent attempt to undermine patrician privilege, Clodius had hired slave-gangs to forcibly take control of the festival. The attempt was a failure, and Clodius was prosecuted for this and other outrages against Rome's traditional and social proprieties.&lt;ref&gt;Roller, 1999, p. 296, citing Cicero, ''De Haruspicum Responsis'', 13. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The protection, preservation, conservation and restoration of [[industrial heritage]] and related machinery is often overlooked in social histories. As the importance of the industrial heritage of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Australia]] has become more prominent, the '''Melbourne Steam Traction Engine Club''' (MSTEC) was established by volunteers to enable like-minded volunteers to preserve this part of our history. The '''Melbourne Steam Traction Engine Club''' was established in [[Melbourne]] over 45 years ago and is located at 1200 Ferntree Gully Rd [[Scoresby, Victoria]], [[Australia]].  On site there is an extensive collection of Mobile Steam, Stationary [[Steam Engine]]s, Stationary IC Engines, [[Diesel engines]], Diesel [[Engine-generator|Generator]] sets, [[Tractors]] and other mobile machinery.&lt;ref&gt;Members Handbook, 3rd edition - Aug 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Formed in 1963 the MSTEC has been at its present 6½ hectare site in [[Scoresby, Victoria]] since 1986 when the land was leased from the Beamish Heavy Haulage at Wantirna.  The site was originally a depot used for the tunnelling of the main [[trunk sewer]] and was a desolate waste land when the club took it over.  Since occupation, the site as been developed  with landscaping, tree planting, installation of the rail track, construction of the 9 sheds and toilet block and a man made lake.&lt;ref&gt;Members Handbook, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Steam Centre display==
The engines  on display at the National Steam Centre represent many years of collection and restoration efforts by the members. In addition to the engines owned by the club, a number of members' privately owned engines are kept at the centre. A particular effort has gone in to ensure Australian steam and industrial heritage is preserved for Australians, in Australia, rather than allowing local heritage to be shipped overseas.

==Run days==
Many of the engines on display are operated on the last Sunday of each month. This unique opportunity allows visitors to see many of the steam and diesel stationary engines running, including several steam [[Traction engine]]s, [[steam roller]]s and tractors operating in the central arena. Rides aboard the miniature steam railway are a highlight! 

==Annual rally==
The club's annual rally, known as the '''Scoresby Steamfest''' is held on the long week end in March each year when many of the beautifully restored MSTEC engines are exhibited and operated. Particular emphasis is placed on exhibiting engines as they were intended to be used, driving industrial or agricultural implements for example. Exhibits from many other associated clubs and historic machinery associations are also displayed and operated, as well as that from private collectors and enthusiasts. More recently, exhibits at the '''Scoresby Steamfest''' have grown to encompass many other hobbies and collections, including model and experimantal engineering and crafting, collections of antique engineering artifacts and tools, oil lamps, mechanical music, and other items from bygone eras.

==Railway==
The miniature railway operates every Sunday, weather permitting, from 11 am to 4 pm, except for the Christmas - New Year period. The track runs for about 1&amp;nbsp;km around the perimeter of the site. On the trip you pass the lake complete with numerous ducks and other water birds, you see the cattle grazing on the nearby farmland and you view some of the museum machinery around the track.

The line is only set up to run a single train at any one time. On the last Sunday of the month the train is pulled by a 4-4-2 steam locomotive. On other Sundays the diesel outline engine is used.

The grounds have shady trees, picnic tables and wood-fired barbecues for a picnic outing. There is no charge for admission to the grounds except for some special events like the annual rally.

The '''Minnesota State Fair''' is the [[state fair]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Minnesota]]. Its slogan is "'''The Great Minnesota Get-Together.'''" It is the largest state fair in the [[United States]] by average daily attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Detailed Daily Attendance| publisher =Minnesota State Fair| url =http://www.mnstatefair.org/general_info/attendance.html| accessdate = 2014-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the second-largest state fair in the [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carnivalwarehouse.com/lists/2010list.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; by total attendance, trailing only the [[State Fair of Texas]], which generally runs twice as long as the Minnesota State Fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Fiscal Notes, September 2003| publisher =Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts|date=September 2003| url =http://www.window.state.tx.us/comptrol/fnotes/fn0309/big.html| accessdate = 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state fairgrounds, adjoining the Saint Paul campus of the [[University of Minnesota]], are in [[Falcon Heights, Minnesota]], midway between the state's [[capital (political)|capital]] city of [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] and its largest city, [[Minneapolis]], near the [[Como Park, Zoo, and Conservatory|Como Park]] and [[Saint Anthony Park, Saint Paul|Saint Anthony Park]] neighborhoods of Saint Paul. Residents of the state and region come to the fair to be entertained, exhibit their best [[livestock]], show off their abilities in a variety of fields including [[art]] and [[cooking]], learn about new products and services, and eat many different types of [[food]]&amp;mdash;often on a stick. The fair runs for twelve days from late August into early September, ending on [[Labor Day]]. The Minnesota State Fair was named the best state fair in the United States in 2015 by readers of [[USA Today]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.10best.com/awards/travel/best-state-fair/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minnesota State Fair is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the area. Around two million people attend the Fair annually&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rove.me/to/midwest/minnesota-state-fair|title=Minnesota State Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Attendance in 2018 was a record 2,046,533 people.&lt;ref name=strib2018attendance /&gt; The highest daily attendance in the history of the fair was 270,426 visitors on Saturday, September 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minnesota State Fair Sets 1-Day Attendance Record Saturday|url=https://www.mnstatefair.org/about-the-fair/attendance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:1910postcardStateFairMN.jpg|thumb|right|1910 Minnesota State Fair postcard]]
[[Minnesota Territory]] first held a Territorial Fair in 1854, although the first Minnesota State Fair didn't occur until 1859, the year after statehood. Since then, the fair has run annually except for five different years. In 1861 and 1862, the fair was not held because of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and the [[Dakota War of 1862]]. Scheduling issues between the fair and the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] caused the 1893 show to be canceled. The fair again closed because of war in 1945, as [[fuel]] was in short supply. It was again closed in 1946 because of an outbreak of [[polio]].&lt;ref name="presskit06"&gt;

In its early years during the 19th century, the fair was held in many different locations. Some were not far from the current site, but others were held in Greater Minnesota, including years where it was held in [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]], [[Owatonna, Minnesota|Owatonna]], and [[Winona, Minnesota|Winona]]. For a time in the 1870s, the [[Minneapolis-St. Paul|Twin Cities]] of [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] and St. Paul held competing fairs. Minneapolis, the younger city of the pair, eventually outdid its neighbor by staging the larger fair with the help of [[William S. King]].&lt;ref&gt;

In 1884, a [[committee]] was put together by the [[Minnesota State Agricultural Society]] to select a permanent site. One site that was considered was an area around [[Minnehaha Falls]], but the final site chosen was the [[Ramsey County, Minnesota|Ramsey County]] [[Poor farm|Poor Farm]], the fair's current site. It was a politically neutral site, being about halfway between Minneapolis and St. Paul. The fair first opened its doors there on September 7, 1885. The site was then 210 [[acre]]s (0.8&amp;nbsp;km²), but now stands at 322 acres (1.3&amp;nbsp;km²)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Fair |url=https://www.mnstatefair.org/about-the-fair/ |website=Minnesota State Fair |date=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:PrincessKay.jpg|thumb|left|[[Linda Christensen]] sculpting Princess Kay in 2010]]
One of the first annual events to occur is the creation of a [[butter sculpture]]. Each year, a new [[Princess Kay of the Milky Way]] is selected to promote Minnesota's [[dairy]] industry. Part of the job involves posing for several hours in a walk-in, glass-walled refrigerator as a 90-pound (41&amp;nbsp;kg) block of butter is carved into a head with her likeness. Butter makers started sculpting their products at the fair as far back as 1898, although the head-sculpting tradition didn't begin until 1964.

The main entrance to the fair from Snelling Avenue heads onto a road named [[Dan Patch]] Avenue for a [[harness racing|pacer]] [[horse]] who won every race he ran in from 1900 to 1909 when he was retired.

One of the most significant dates in the fair's history was September 2, 1901, when then-[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was visiting and first uttered the famous phrase, "Speak softly and carry a [[Big stick diplomacy|big stick]]." Roosevelt became [[President of the United States|president]] just 12 days later after [[William McKinley]] was assassinated. In 1925, the Minnesota State Fair was the site of the Norse-American Centennial celebration. During his appearance at the [[Norse-American Centennial]], President [[Calvin Coolidge]] gave recognition to the contributions of [[Scandinavian-Americans]] and noted [[Leif Erikson]] as the discoverer of America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naha.stolaf.edu/pubs/nas/volume33/vol33_10.htm ''The 1925 Norse-American Immigration Centennial and Ethnic Identity'' (April Schultz. Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume 33: Page 267) ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, attendance was well over a million people and the record day that year was about 197,000 visitors. By 2016, attendance neared 2 million and the record day was about a quarter-million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-state-fair-on-track-to-set-attendance-record/442706653/ | newspaper = [[Minneapolis Star Tribune]] | title = Minnesota State Fair on track to set attendance record | last = Roper | first = Eric | date = September 5, 2017 | accessdate = September 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2018 was another record year for the Fair. The overall attendance record of 2,046,533 was set along with an all-time single-day attendance record of 270,426 on the second Saturday. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.mnstatefair.org/about-the-fair/attendance/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attractions==

===Livestock===
A large portion of the Fairgrounds are occupied by livestock barns, where various farm animals are displayed.  The animals and their owners take part in livestock shows to compete for awards.  Most of the shows take place in the coliseum, a large indoor arena on the fairgrounds. The Coliseum was constructed to replace the Hippodrome, which was rendered structurally unsound during its use as a Propeller Plant by the A.O. Smith Corporation during WWII and razed in 1946, and was completed for use in the 1951 fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Speer|first=Ray P.|title=Minnesota State Fair: The History and Heritage of 100 Years|year=1964|publisher=Argus Publishing Company|pages=237, 271}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Open class livestock competitions are held in horses, beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, sheep, dairy goats, [[llama]]s, poultry (chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, pigeons) rabbits, and  stock [[dog]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Open Class Livestock| publisher = Minnesota State Fair| year =2007| url=http://www.mnstatefair.org/pages/livestock.html| accessdate = 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, 2007, a bull escaped from its handler charging several fairgoers before fatally injuring itself charging a fire hydrant.

One of the primary attractions at the State Fair is the wide variety of foods to be had.{{or-inline|date=December 2017}} Classic fair foods such as [[Cotton Candy|cotton candy]] and [[Hot Dogs|hot dogs]] are available.  Some foods reflect Minnesota's agriculture, including [[Cheese Curds|cheese curds]], milk shakes, and [[Corn Dog|corn dogs]].  Many foods at the fair are deep fried or come on a stick; from the classic corn dog to alligator-on-a-stick, lobster-on-a-stick, and deep fried candy bar on a stick. New to the fair in 2006 was [[hotdish]] on a stick, a variant of a classic staple of Minnesotan cuisine. In 2007, one new food was [[spaghetti]] on a stick. 2008's new foods included two types of [[bacon]], one called "Pig Lickers", which is chocolate covered, and the other, called the "Big Fat Bacon", a quarter pound of maple glazed bacon. Another staple of the state fair is “Sweet Martha’s Cookies” a stand that serves fresh and warm chocolate chip cookies in buckets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = new tastes, their takes| work = twincities.com| pages = 10E| publisher = St. Paul Pioneer Press| date = 2008-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2018, 27 new foods were introduced to the Minnesota State Fair including Firecracker Shrimp Stuffed Avocado, Honey Cream Soda Float, Mangonada Shaved Ice, Messy Giuseppe, Nordic Waffles, Smoked Soft Serve Ice Cream, and the UpNorth Puff Pastry.&lt;ref&gt;https://assets.mnstatefair.org/pdf/18-new-food.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Machinery Hill===
Machinery Hill is a large area of the fairgrounds. For several decades, it held the largest annual display of [[farm equipment]] in the world, with many companies showing off [[tractor]]s, [[combine harvester|combines]], and various attachments. However, modern displays generally focus on [[automobile|car]]s, trucks, [[lawn mower]]s, hot tubs and recreational machines like [[motorbike]]s.  Farm implement dealers tend to direct their efforts to more targeted "farm shows," abandoning the State Fair to more urban or suburban types of exhibitors. Machinery Hill also contains an interactive exhibit for kids called Little Farm Hands. In this exhibit, children get to experience life on the farm from planting seeds to selling goods at the farmers market. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnstatefair.org/entertainment/ag_exhibits/lfh.html|title=Minnesota State Fair {{!}} Little Farm Hands|website=www.mnstatefair.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shows===
[[File:PHCstage2008StateFair.JPG|thumb|left|''A Prairie Home Companion'' live at the grandstand]]
The State Fair is host to numerous shows, including concerts, comedy shows, [[product demonstration]]s, and the State Fair Talent Contest. The Grandstand is a large outdoor concert hall that also features 3 floors of interior exhibition space. It hosts the largest of the fairs concerts and until 2002 was also the site of [[stock car]] races run on a small oval track. In 2003 the facility completed the first phase of a $35 million remodeling project that removed large sections of bleachers and increased [[seating capacity]] to 17,000.&lt;ref name="GCMPR"&gt;{{cite news | first = Greta |last = Cunningham |title = State Fair Grandstand to get a facelift |url = http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2003/08/18_cunninghamg_grandstand/ |publisher = Minnesota Public Radio |date = 2003-08-18 | accessdate = 2006-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most local television and radio stations set up temporary studios at the State Fair in their permanent buildings or booths, including for example a live broadcast of [[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]''. As of 2013, the Grandstand hosts the Walker Art Center's Internet Cat Video Festival, in which fairgoers watch the year's most popular cat videos and memes and award the best videos with cat trophies, the most prized being the Golden Kitty.{{fact|date=December 2017}} Guest appearances have included Grumpy Cat and Lil Bub, two internet stars, as well as the creator of Nyan Cat, Christopher Torres. The festival began in 2012.

==Management==
The Minnesota State Fair is considered a quasi-state agency, under the direction of the Minnesota State Agricultural Society. The management of the fair is handled by the Board of managers. The state fair has not accepted any governmental funds since 1949. Revenue from the fair is reinvested into maintenance and the next year's fair.

The Minnesota State Fair Foundation is an organization that works to improve and preserves historic state fair buildings. The foundation is a [[501(c)3]] organization, and also supports State Fair agricultural, scientific and educational programs.  The foundation provided funding for the new Miracle of Birth center.

The Fair employs about 80 full-time staff members for the entire year; in the summer, some 400 seasonal staff are hired. During the fair-time, around 3,000 people are additionally hired&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mnstatefair.org/about-the-fair/|title=About the Fair|publisher=Minnesota State Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==J.V. Bailey House==
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[J.V. Bailey House]] --&gt;
[[File:BaileyHouse.JPG|thumb|right|The restored J.V. Bailey House]]
The J.V. Bailey House, at 1263 Cosgrove Street, is one of the oldest buildings on the fairgrounds. It was built in 1911 and restoration was completed in 2006. It is connected to the greenhouses and was occupied year-round by the greenhouse superintendent until 2004. The State Fair Foundation operates out of the residence. The historic residence is open to Foundation donors and their family and friends during the fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =J.V.

==Mascots==
The fair's mascots are two anthropomorphized [[Gopher (animal)|gophers]]. The choice of gopher as mascots was an homage to the [[University of Minnesota]] [[Goldy Gopher|mascot]] which is also a gopher and was a historical reference to the expansion of railroads in Minnesota, towns popping up across the state like gophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minnesota State Fair History|url=http://www.mnstatefair.org/pdf/media/MSF-History.pdf|website=Minnesota State Fair|publisher=Minnesota State Agricultural Society|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, Minnesota is sometimes referred to as the gopher state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minnesota Moment: Why we're called the Gopher State|url=http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-moment-why-we-re-called-the-gopher-state/474225163/|accessdate=14 May 2018|agency=Star Tribune Media Company, LLC|publisher=Star Tribune|date=February 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairchild, the original mascot, was suggested in a statewide contest by Gladys Anderson Brown in 1966 in honor of Henry S. Fairchild who advocated using the former Ramsey County Poor Farm as the permanent site of the fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berdan|first1=Kathy|title=Q&amp;A: Usually mute Fairchild is funnier – and punnier – than we thought|url=https://www.twincities.com/2016/08/25/pioneer-press-fairchild-mn-state-fair-mascot-50/|accessdate=14 May 2018|agency=Digital First Media|publisher=Twin Cities Pioneer Press|date=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dressed like an early [[Barker (occupation)|barker]] on the midway with a straw hat and striped jacket, Fairchild has represented the fair since 1966. In 1986, he was joined on promotional materials by his nephew, Fairborn.&lt;ref&gt;

==Off-season use==

The fairgrounds is heavily used for events beyond the Fair. These include many horse shows in the Coliseum &amp; Horse Barn, the Minnesota Horse Expo and the Minnesota Beef Expo, dog shows, antique &amp; hot-rod car shows, motorcycle shows, model railroad shows, clothing &amp; jewellery shows, gun &amp; weapon collectors shows, comic book conventions, flea markets &amp; swap meets, and more.  Buildings on the grounds are frequently rented for commercial events such as appliance sales, computer &amp; electronics sales, and boat &amp; car sales. Earlier in the summer, some of the fairground's roads are used to host an annual series of bike races during the week, called the State Fair Affair Criterium Series.

In addition, many of the buildings are rented for winter storage of boats, camping trailers, and similar equipment.

Rental fees for such off-season use of the fairgrounds is a major source of revenue for the State Fair, often surpassing the profits from the Fair itself.

The Coliseum was the home rink for many college and high school hockey teams. After 40 years and a few thousand games the facility saw its final game played in February, 2014.

'''Moskau Messe Exhibition Company '''organises exhibitions, conferences and fairs in [[Moscow|Moscow, Russia]] and abroad. In 2011 Moskau Messe Exhibition Company became a full member of the Russian Union of Exhibitions and Fairs.

== History ==

Moskau Messe Company (Moscow Fair) was founded in 1989 as a [[History of Germans in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union|Soviet-German]] joint venture. The company’s exhibitions were hosted in the Sokolniki Cultural and Exhibition Center, (the current [[Sokolniki Exhibition and Convention Centre]]) which had been underused since the 1960s, when it was one of the county’s main exhibition centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informexpo.ru/new/view_content.php?id=1484 |title=From Moskau Messe to MVK Holding |publisher=Informexpo.ru |date= |accessdate=2014-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, Moskau Messe launched a series of projects that remain viable to this day. Polygraphinter was the first large-scale event to be held in Sokolniki in 1992. Other projects included EuroExpoMebel, International Construction Week, Woodex (woodworking industries) in 1993, Rosupak in 1996 and the Russian Education Forum in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kommersant.ru/doc/265646/print |title=Exhibitions, fairs and salons: the first half of 1991 The Kommersant newspaper, no.5 (55), 01/28/1991 |publisher=Kommersant.ru |date=1991-01-28 |accessdate=2014-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Moskau Messe founded the MVK International Exhibition Company, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/266000/print |title=New Sokolniki: shunting revirescence?

In 2003, offices opened in [[Germany]] and [[Canada]] and in 2004, another one was opened in [[Israel]]. In 2007 and 2008, offices were opened in [[Turkey]] and [[China]].

From 2006 to 2010, Moskau Messe Exhibition Company, with the Sokolniki Exhibition and Convention Centre, launched a number of socio-educational projects including Still higher, and higher, and higher (the first exhibition in the stratosphere),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvkstars.ru/eng/default.aspx |title=MVK Exhibition Company - Still higher, and higher, and higher! |publisher=Mvkstars.ru |date= |accessdate=2014-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; TWO PARISes (in [[France]] and [[Russia]]), the first exhibition at the [[Eiffel Tower]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paris.sokolniki.com/eng/default.aspx |title=Выставки Возможности Рынки |publisher=Paris.sokolniki.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our Victory Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://victory.sokolniki.com/eng/default.aspx |title=Our victory |publisher=Victory.sokolniki.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and From Earth to the Universe.

== Current operations ==

'''Desirée Mariottini''' was an 16-year-old Italian girl who was last seen on 18 October 2018 and was murdered soon after in [[Rome]], Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Fu stuprata da non cosciente" L'orrore sul corpo di Desirée |url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/roma/fu-stuprata-non-cosciente-lorrore-sul-corpo-desir-e-1592494.html |accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Mariottini was born and lived in [[Cisterna di Latina]] (Latina) in the region of [[Lazio]].{{Cn|date=October 2018}}

The San Lorenzo district is a traditionally [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] neighborhood still scarred by [[World War II]] bombings.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/world/europe/italy-salvini-immigration.html|title=Salvini Seizes on 2nd Italian Teenager’s Death to Push Immigration Issue|last=|first=|date=|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder and investigation==
On 17 October 2018, Mariottini missed the last bus and did not return to her home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2018/10/29/gang-lied-to-teen-on-fatal-drug-mix-to-rape-her-gip_7f8670d6-6f31-4b95-bda4-a5b519217203.html|title=Gang lied to teen on fatal drug mix to rape her - GIP - English|date=2018-10-29|work=ANSA.it|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desirée Mariottini was drugged unconscious and sexually abused in a [[Drug house|drug den]] in the San Lorenzo district in Rome.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While Desirèe was unconscious she was abused several times by different people. As reconstructed, she had taken  drugs as early as the afternoon of October 18th, and died later on the night of 19 October. She was being abused while she was dying. This was shown by the investigations conducted by the police in Rome and by the San Lorenzo police station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Desirée: fermate due persone, caccia ai complici. Salvini: "I vermi pagheranno" |url=http://www.ansa.it/lazio/notizie/2018/10/25/desiree-polizia-ferma-due-persone_759d633b-c7ef-40a4-ace1-55af4e23bf4b.html |accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=San Lorenzo, l'ex enclave rossa senza più anima |url=http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cronaca/2018/10/25/san-lorenzo-lex-enclave-rossa-senza-piu-anima-_c0bb745a-631a-4461-8460-b678fce9d99f.html |accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 October two people were arrested for the murder:  Mamadou Gara 26 and Brian Minteh 43 , both [[Senegal]] and living illegally in Italy.{{fact|date=October 2018}} Both are accused, along other suspects, of group sexual violence, drug possession and voluntary homicide. The police are looking for at least two other men involved in the murder. The criminals were identified after a series of testimonies and findings made in the building where the body was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Desirée: fermate due persone, caccia ai complici. Salvini: "I vermi pagheranno" |url=http://www.ansa.it/lazio/notizie/2018/10/25/desiree-polizia-ferma-due-persone_759d633b-c7ef-40a4-ace1-55af4e23bf4b.html |accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Alinno Chima, aged 40 from [[Nigeria]] was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45976450|title=Migrants held as girl's killing shocks Italy|date=2018-10-25|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/europe/90435/migrants_held_in_italy_over_girls_death|title=Migrants held in Italy over girl's death|work=MaltaToday.com.mt|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghanaiantimes.com.gh/migrants-held-as-girls-killing-shocks-italy/|title=Migrants held as girl’s killing shocks Italy - Ghanaian Times|website=www.ghanaiantimes.com.gh|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 October 2018 a fourth arrest was made, Yusif Salia from [[Gambia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/italian-police-arrest-4th-suspect-in-teens-murder-in-rome/ar-BBOWmJT|title=Italian police arrest 4th suspect in teen's murder in Rome|website=www.msn.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the arrested [[Illegal immigration|had legal documents]] to reside in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/10/26/world/europe/ap-eu-italy-teen-slain-.html|title=Italian Police Arrest 4th Suspect in Teen's Murder in Rome|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Mariottini was buried on Sunday 30 october in Cisterna di Latina in a ceremony attended by hundreds and mayor Raggi declared a day of mourning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ansa.it/english/news/general_news/2018/10/30/crowds-flock-to-desiree-funeral_98bbee0e-24d7-45d9-81b4-77f199b148fd.html|title=Crowds flock to Desirée funeral - English|date=2018-10-30|work=ANSA.it|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.romatoday.it/cronaca/desiree-mariottini-funerali-30-ottobre-2018.html|title=Desirée Mariottini morta a San Lorenzo: oggi i funerali, Roma è in lutto|work=RomaToday|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visit by Minister Matteo Salvini at the scene of the crime===
On October 24th 2018 [[Italian Minister of the Interior|interior minister]] [[Matteo Salvini]], the leader of the anti-migration [[Lega Nord|Northern League party]], went to the abandoned building where the girl's body was found.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Desirée, Salvini a San Lorenzo |url=http://www.ansa.it/lazio/notizie/2018/10/24/desiree-salvini-a-san-lorenzo_edb33358-4b98-46e3-bf66-48be9d9f0c7a.html |accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activists in the traditionally left-wing San Lorenzo district prevented Salvini from placing a rose outside the drug den where the victim was found and accused Salvini of exploiting her death. He returned later in the day unannounced and placed the flowers in front of the gate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Pronouncements by the [[President of the European Parliament]] [[Antonio Tajani]]===
The tragedy of Desirée "must be the last that happens in Italy and in Rome, an abandoned city, the degradation is evident, moral and social, more checks are needed in the city, more men and women of the police are needed, especially at night".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=alaNEWS|title=Desirée, Tajani: "Degrado a Roma, si diano una mossa"|date=2018-10-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r32fk9XeXvM|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The decision of the mayor of Rome===
The Rome Mayor [[Virginia Raggi]] decided to proclaim a day of mourning for the city in conjunction with the funeral of Desirée Mariottini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Desirée: fermate tre persone. Un testimone all'ANSA: "Stava male, intorno 7-8 persone" |url=http://www.ansa.it/lazio/notizie/2018/10/25/desiree-polizia-ferma-due-persone_759d633b-c7ef-40a4-ace1-55af4e23bf4b.html |accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also declared the intention of city authorities to have the building demolished. In a social media post, she stated that as a mayor, as a woman and the mayor of the city she could not tolerate the thought of this crime and called it an "atrocious crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.euronews.com/2018/10/26/african-migrants-arrested-in-connection-with-italian-teenager-s-death-the-cube|title=African migrants arrested in connection with Italian teenager's death {{!}} The Cube|date=2018-10-26|work=euronews|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 25 October 2018, a spontaneous torch-light procession by the people of Rome San Lorenzo was organized to ask for "justice for Desirée".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=San Lorenzo scende in strada.

====Protests against the mayor of Rome====
On 27 October 2018, the citizens of [[Rome]] protest against the deterioration of the city, in which some areas such as  Via Dei Lucani 22 are crumbling and abandoned to carelessness, and, above all, to criminals as drug dealers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Roma, cittadini in piazza contro la Raggi |url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/roma/roma-cittadini-piazza-contro-raggi-1593430.html |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Naderabad''' was a city created in 1738 by [[Nader Shah]], the [[King of Persia]] from 1736 to 1747. Nader built the city in the aftermath of his army's destruction of [[Old Kandahar]] and named the city after himself. The city was near the Šorāb river, and {{convert|4|km|spell=in}} from the remnants of Old Kandahar. When Nader Shah died in 1747 the city was abandoned.,&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia-iranica&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Planhol|first1=Xavier|title=Kandahar: Historical Geography to 1979|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kandahar-historical-geography-to-1979|website=IranicaOnline.org|publisher=[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it continued to appear on 19th century European maps.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Iranica: Kandahar&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Park was born on 2 February 1952, in Samdeok-dong of [[Jung District, Daegu]], as the first child of [[Park Chung-hee]], the 3rd president of South Korea who served between 1963 and 1979, and [[Yuk Young-soo]]. She has a younger brother, Park Ji-man, and a younger sister, [[Park Geun-ryeong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Candidacy of ruling party leader's sister gets cold shoulder |date=18 March 2012 |publisher=The Korea Herald |url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20120318000328}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is unmarried with no children. [[Pew Research Center]] described her as an atheist with a Buddhist and Roman Catholic upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/08/12/6-facts-about-christianity-in-south-korea/|title=6 facts about South Korea's growing Christian population|date=12 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her native Korean, Park also speaks English, French, Spanish, and Mandarin with varying degrees of fluency.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In 1953, Park's family moved to Seoul and she graduated from Seoul's Jangchung Elementary School and Sungshim (literal: Sacred Heart) Girls' Middle and High School in 1970, going on to receive a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[electronic engineering]] from [[Sogang University]] in 1974.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} She briefly studied at [[Joseph Fourier University]], but left France following the murder of her mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harlan |first=Chico |date=25 January 2013 |title=South Korea's new leader, Park Geun-hye, was pushed onto political stage by tragedy |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/for-s-koreas-park-after-tragedy-a-first-taste-of-power/2013/01/25/0dc9382e-5e30-11e2-90a0-73c8343c6d61_story.html |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Park's mother was killed on 15 August 1974 in the [[National Theater of Korea]]; [[Mun Se-gwang]], a [[Koreans in Japan|Japanese-born ethnic Korean]] sympathizer of [[North Korea]] and member of the [[Chongryon]], was attempting to assassinate President Park Chung-hee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=180730|script-title=ko:8·15대통령저격사건 (八一五大統領狙擊事件) |trans-title=15 August President assassination-attempt incident|publisher= Doopedia (두산백과)|accessdate=13 May 2012|language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt; Park was regarded as [[First Lady]] until the [[assassination of Park Chung-hee|assassination of her father]] by his own intelligence chief, [[Kim Jae-gyu]], on 26 October 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Profile: South Korean President Park Geun-hye|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-20787271|accessdate=3 January 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|date=10 March 2017|quote=Some said the association with her father - and her experience as first lady - helped cement her win by overcoming prejudices among male voters.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://belfercenter.hks.harvard.edu/files/kogan-apsa-aug-2013.pdf|title=Weiner, Tim: ''Legacy of Ashes.

== Career ==

=== Assembly woman ===
Park was elected a Grand National Party (GNP) assemblywoman for [[Dalseong County]], Daegu, in 1998 [[by-election]], and three more times in the same electoral district between 1998 and 2008, being the incumbent assemblywoman till April 2012. In 2012, she announced that she would not run for a constituency representative seat for the 19th election in Dalseong or anywhere else, but for a proportional representative position for the Saenuri Party instead, in order to lead the party's election campaign.&lt;ref name="New Pres Dec 19 2012" /&gt; She was elected as a proportional representative in the [[South Korean legislative election, 2012|April 2012 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Chung Min-uck |date=20 March 2013 |title=Saenuri names proportional representatives |url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/03/116_107308.html |work=Korea Times |accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-Fackler"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fackler |first=Martin |date=20 April 2012 |title=In a Rowdy Democracy, a Dictator's Daughter With an Unsoiled Aura |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/21/world/asia/park-geun-hye-an-unsoiled-leader-in-south-koreas-rowdy-democracy.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GNP chairwoman and "Queen of Elections" ===
Due to the failed attempt to impeach President [[Roh Moo-hyun]] and the bribery scandal of its 2002 presidential candidate, [[Lee Hoi-chang]] (revealed in 2004), the GNP was facing a severe defeat in the 2004 general election. Park was appointed as the chairwoman of the party and led the election efforts. In the election, the GNP lost its majority position but managed to gain 121 seats, which is largely considered a great achievement under such inhospitable circumstances for the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0005579513 |title=총선 D-1 승패기준..영남승부 관심 |accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/04/08/2012040800451.html |title=[증시閑담] 총선 결과에 촉각 세우는 주식시장 |accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the chairwoman of the GNP, Park helped her party make significant gains in local elections and actually obtain a majority in 2006.

During the campaign, on 20 May 2006, Ji Chung-ho, a 50-year-old man with eight criminal convictions, slashed Park's face with a utility knife, causing an 11-centimeter wound that required 60 stitches and several hours of surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2006/05/22/2006052261007.html |title=Joint Probe into Attack on GNP Chairwoman |work=Arirang News |date=22 May 2006 |accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=038&amp;aid=0000330425 |script-title=ko:박근혜대표 유세장서 피습 중상 |trans-title=GNP leader Park Geun-hye attacked during campaign |date=21 May 2006 |accessdate=16 May 2012 |work=Hankook Ilbo |author1=Gim Yi-sak(김이삭) |author2=Chung Min-seung(정민승) |language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt; A famous anecdote from this incident occurred when Park was hospitalized after the attack. The first word that she said to her secretary after her recovery from her wound was "How is [[Daejeon]]?" After this, the candidate from the Grand National Party won the election for mayor of the city of Daejeon despite having trailed by more than 20 percentage points in opinion polls up to the point of the attack. In addition, during her term as the GNP chairwoman between 2004 and 2006, the party won all 40 reelections and by-elections held, which was largely credited to her influence and efforts. This feat gave Park a nickname "Queen of Elections".&lt;ref name="2006 Maeil Kyongge article"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=009&amp;aid=0000506402|title=대전 "박근혜 생각하면 결심이 흔들려요"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2011 Yeonhap News article"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0005298622 |script-title=ko:박근혜, 野시절 `40대 0 신화'.이번엔?|trans-title=Park Geun-hye scored 40 to 0 as the opposition.

On 12 February 2007, Park made a much-publicized visit to [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], United States. Her visit culminated in an address to a packed audience at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]], where she said she wanted to save Korea and advocated a stronger relationship between [[South Korea–United States relations|South Korea and the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=516993 |title=Politician Wants To 'Save' Korea: South Korean National Assembly member advocates alliance with United States |date= 13 February 2007 |accessdate=16 May 2012 |work=The Harvard Crimson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icasinc.org/2007/2007l/2007lghp.html |title=The Republic of Korea and the United States:Our Future Together |date=21 February 2007 |accessdate=16 May 2012 |work=Institute for Corean-American Studies, Inc.|quote=An Address Delivered at the ARCO (John F. Kennedy Jr.) Forum, John F. Kennedy School of Government Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2007 Presidential bid ===
Park hoped to emulate her father's success by becoming the presidential nominee of the Grand National Party.&lt;ref name="NYT-Fackler"/&gt; She eventually lost to [[Lee Myung-bak]] by a narrow margin. Lee had a commanding lead at the beginning of the primary season, but Park was able to narrow the gap through allegations of Lee's corruption. Park won the "party members' bid", but she lost the "national bid", which is a larger percentage of the total presidential bid.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== 2008 general election ===
After the [[South Korean presidential election, 2007|2007 presidential election]], President Lee Myung-bak formed a government of mostly close supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestyuopics/people/l/lee_myung_bak/index.html | title= Lee Myung-bak | work= The New York Times| date= 25 July 2012 | accessdate=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Park's supporters argued that this was a kind of political reprisal, and that they should secede from the Grand National Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://spearheadresearch.org/SR_CMS/index.php/internationalaffairssecuirty/south-korea-park-likely-to-be-first-female-president | archive-url= https://archive.is/20130416011926/http://spearheadresearch.org/SR_CMS/index.php/internationalaffairssecuirty/south-korea-park-likely-to-be-first-female-president | dead-url= yes | archive-date= 16 April 2013 | title= South Korea: Park Likely to be First Female President | work= Spearhead Research | date= 28 August 2012 | accessdate= 13 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, they formed parties named [[Pro-Park Coalition]] and Solidarity for Pro-Park Independents (친박 무소속 연대; ''Chin Park Musosok Yeondae''). Park herself did not join them, but indirectly supported them by announcing "I hope these people will come back alive." After the mass secession, the rebels announced that they would rejoin GNP after the general election, but the GNP prohibited it. In the following [[South Korean legislative election, 2008|2008 general election]], the rebels won 26 seats: 14 from the Pro-Park Coalition and 12 as independents. Together, they played a pivotal role in the GNP's narrow majority. Park continually insisted that GNP should allow the return of her supporters. As of 2011, most of these rebels had returned to the GNP, resulting in approximately 50 to 60 assembly members who support Park out of 171 in the GNP.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Head of Saenuri Party ===
As a response to the dwindling approval rating of the GNP, the party formed an emergency committee and changed the name of the political party from the Grand National Party to the ''Saenuri'' Party, meaning "New Frontier" Party.&lt;ref name="New Pres Dec 19 2012" /&gt; On 19 December 2011, Park was appointed as the chairwoman of GNP's Emergency Committee, the [[de facto]] leader of the party.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== 2012 parliamentary election ===
The Saenuri Party achieved a surprise win against the opposing [[Democratic United Party]] in the 2012 General Election, winning 152 seats and retaining its majority position. Because of the corruption scandals of the Lee administration revealed before the election, the Saenuri Party was widely expected to win no more than 100 seats.&lt;ref name="2012 Hankyoreh article"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/politics/politics_general/527972.html |script-title=ko:‘선거의 여왕’ 화려한 귀환...수도권·젊은층에선 한계 |trans-title=Return of Queen of election.

For this reason, the 2012 election was often dubbed the "return of the Queen of Election".&lt;ref name="2012 Hankyoreh article" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2012 edaily article"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edaily.co.kr/news/NewsRead.edy?SCD=DA32&amp;newsid=01787606596478848&amp;DCD=A01503&amp;OutLnkChk=Y|script-title=ko:'여왕의 화려한 귀환' 박근혜가 돌아왔다|trans-title=Return of Queen of election, Park Geun-hye returned as GNP leader|date=15 December 2011|accessdate=16 May 2012|language=Korean|author=Kim Sung-gon(김성곤)|work=Edaily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saenuri's defeat in the populous Seoul metropolitan area in this election, however, revealed the limitation of Park's political influence.&lt;ref name="2012 Hankyoreh article" /&gt;

=== 2012 presidential campaign ===
{{Main|South Korean presidential election, 2012}}
Park had been the leading candidate for the [[South Korean presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]] in every national-level poll in South Korea between 2008, when the Lee Myung-bak administration began, and September 2011, with an approval rating of 25% to 45%, more than twice that of the second candidate. Park's approval rating was highest when the 2008 National Assembly election showed her strong influence and lowest in early 2010 as a result of her political stance against the Lee administration in [[Sejong City]] issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0005258502| script-title=ko:박근혜 대세론 `휘청'..스타일 변화 모색|trans-title=Park Geun-hye's top candidate position is challenged. needs to change her style|date=8 September 2011|accessdate=16 May 2012|work=[[Yonhap News]]|author=Kim Hwa-young(김화영)|language=Korean|quote=Faced with rising [[Ahn Cheol-soo]]'s approval rate, Park Geun-hye's leadership is in question.

In September 2011, [[Ahn Cheol-soo]], a former venture IT&amp;nbsp;businessman and the Dean of Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology at [[Seoul National University]], emerged as a strong independent candidate for the presidency. In national-level presidential polls in September 2011, Ahn and Park Geun Hye closely competed for the status of front-runner, with Park losing the top seat in some polls for the first time since 2008.&lt;ref name="news.naver.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0005260480|script-title=ko:박근혜-안철수, 여론조사 `엎치락뒤치락'|trans-title=Poll: Park Geun-hye and An Cheol-soo are in fierce competition|date=10 September 2011|accessdate=16 May 2012|language=Korean|work=[[Yonhap News]]|author=Kim Nam-kwon(김남권)|quote=All eyes on public opinion after [[Chuseok]] holiday.

After her victory in the 2012 General Election, Park's approval rating increased significantly. In a national-level survey by Mono Research on 30 August&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kmobile.co.kr/k_mnews/news/news_view.asp?tableid=IT&amp;idx=405228 박근혜 컨벤션 효과...안철수 지지율도 동반상승] in 2012, {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Park was the top presidential candidate with an approval rating of 45.5% when competing with all potential candidates, and according to another recent national survey result, had a higher approval rating (50.6%) than Ahn (43.9%) in a two-way competition with him as of 11 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joongang.joinsmsn.com/article/936/9313936.html?ctg=1000&amp;joongang|title=home survey 2012 survey by Realmeter|publisher=joongang.joinsmsn.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126211012/http://joongang.joinsmsn.com/article/936/9313936.html?ctg=1000&amp;joongang|archivedate=26 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 10 July, Park formally announced her 2012 presidential bid at the Time Square, [[Yeongdeungpo District]], Seoul. In this event she emphasized the right to pursue happiness, a democratic economy, and customized welfare services for the Korean people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.donga.com/3/all/20120710/47651073/1|title=박근혜 대선 출마선언…대선레이스 본격 점화|publisher=news.donga.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposing Democratic Party elected [[Moon Jae-in]] as its presidential candidate on 17 September, while Ahn Cheol-soo announced his presidential bid on 19 September. Although still a leading candidate, Park had a lower approval rating than both Ahn and Moon when engaged in two-way competition, according to a 22 September national survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joongang.joinsmsn.com/article/367/9398367.html?ctg=1000&amp;joongang|title=home survey 2012 survey by Realmeter|publisher=joongang.joinsmsn.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126235525/http://joongang.joinsmsn.com/article/367/9398367.html?ctg=1000&amp;joongang|archivedate=26 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was elected as the President of the Republic of Korea on 19 December 2012 with the approval of 51.6% of Korean voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harlan |first=Chico |date=19 December 2012 |title=Park Geun-hye wins South Korea's presidential election |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/park-geun-hye-leads-in-south-koreas-presidential-election/2012/12/19/783398d4-49e6-11e2-b6f0-e851e741d196_story.html |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the NSI has admitted it conducted an illicit campaign to influence the South Korea's 2012 presidential election, mobilising teams of experts in psychological warfare to ensure that the conservative candidate, Park Geun-hye, beat her liberal rival [[Moon Jae-in]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/04/south-koreas-spy-agency-admits-trying-rig-election-national-intelligence-service-2012|title=South Korea spy agency admits trying to rig 2012 presidential election|first=Justin|last=McCurry|date=4 August 2017|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 survey by Korean Research assessing the political stance of 12 potential presidential candidates of South Korea, Park was considered the most conservative candidate.&lt;ref name="New Pres Dec 19 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/politics/201206/h2012060802354721000.htm |title=한국아이닷컴! |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608101501/http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/politics/201206/h2012060802354721000.htm |archivedate= 8 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her conservative, market-oriented political stance was well reflected in her campaign pledge for 2008 presidential bid to cut taxes, reduce regulation, and establish strong law and order.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?year=2012&amp;no=230947|title=2007년, 줄푸세·시장주의 → 2012년, 맞춤형 복지·경제민주화|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009, however, Park started to focus more on welfare issues, advocating customized welfare services to the South Korean people.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Park is well known for her strict, no-compromise adherence to political promises. In 2010, for example, she successfully stopped the Lee administration's attempt to cancel the plan to establish [[Sejong City]], a new national center of administration, arguing the plan was a promise made to people. This conflict between Park and Lee Administration cost her a considerable decrease in her approval rating at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nanumnews.com/sub_read.html?uid=17379&amp;section=sc201|title=[나눔뉴스] "세종시 피로감에 박근혜 지지율 하락세"|publisher=nanumnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Park also vowed to construct a new airport in the southeastern region, a 2008 presidential campaign promise made by GNP but cancelled in 2011, despite claims of economic infeasibility of the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imaeil.com/sub_news/sub_news_view.php?news_id=9929&amp;yy=2012|title=2012 Maeil Sinmoon article|publisher=imaeil.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The administrative vision of President Park Geun-hye's new government is "a new era of hope and happiness". The five Administrative Goals of the government are "a jobs-centered creative economy", "tailored employment and welfare", "creativity-oriented education and cultural enrichment", "a safe and united society" and "strong security measures for sustainable peace on the Korean Peninsula". The Park Geun-hye administration plans to create a trustworthy, clean, and capable government through carrying out these goals, related strategies, and tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korea.net/Government/Current-Affairs/National-Affairs?affairId=346|title=Korea.net : The official website of the Republic of Korea|first=Korean Culture and Information Service|last=(KOCIS)|publisher=korea.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Park chose not to vote in the [[South Korean presidential election, 2017|2017 South Korean presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170509000419 |publisher=''[[The Korea Herald]]'' |title=Did jailed ex-president Park Geun-hye use her vote? |date=9 May 2017 |access-date=13 May 2017 |first=Hyun-ju |last=Ock |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514025809/http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170509000419 |archive-date=14 May 2017 |quote=According to local news reports, she gave up her right to vote as she did not ask for an absentee ballot, which is provided to inmates in detention facilities.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presidency (2013–17) ==

=== Inauguration ===
Park became the 18th president of South Korea on 25 February 2013. At midnight, she took over all presidential authorities including the prerogative of supreme command of South Korea's armed forces from her predecessor Lee Myung-bak. In her inauguration speech at the National Assembly building, Park spoke of her plan to open a new era of hope through "economic prosperity, people's happiness, and cultural enrichment". She particularly expressed her hope that North Korea would give up its nuclear arms and walk on the path of peace and mutual development, and declared that the foundation for a happy era of unification in which all Korean people will be able to enjoy prosperity and freedom and realize their dreams would be built through the Korean Peninsula Trust-building Process. In her inauguration speech, Park presented four guiding principles to realize her administrative vision: economic prosperity, people's happiness, cultural enrichment, and establishment of foundation for peaceful unification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news1.kr/articles/1024223 News1 Korea: President's Inaugural Address] {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Park's inauguration ceremony was the largest one in South Korean history with 70,000 participants. Diplomatic representatives in Korea as well as high-level delegates specially sent from 24 countries around the world including Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, U.S. National Security Advisor Thomas Donilon, Taiwanese Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda also participated in the event to congratulate Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130224000257 |title=Park's swearing-in draws record 70,000 participants |author= |publisher=The Korea Herald |accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/foreign-affairs/2013/02/26/371364/Legislative-Speaker.htm |title=Legislative Speaker Wang attends S.

=== First year (February 2013&amp;nbsp;– February 2014) ===

==== Administrative philosophy ====
The goal of the newly launched Park Geun-hye Administration for governing state affairs is to open "a new era of hope and happiness for all the people". Park avowed that South Korea will break away from its long-pursued development model that centers around the nation, and shift the focus of government administration from the state to individual citizens. Through this process the structure of co-prosperity, in which the citizens become happy and as a result the nation develops, will be created. Park's administrative vision and basic principles for governing the nation are concretely outlined in her policy plans for the economy, society, welfare, diplomacy, and unification. The administration's keywords in managing state affairs are "people", "happiness", "trust", "co-prosperity" and "principle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.president.go.kr/government/philosophy/philosophy.php |title=THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA CHEONG WA DAE |publisher= |accessdate=16 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208001650/http://english.president.go.kr/government/philosophy/philosophy.php |archivedate= 8 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Government restructuring ====
Right after taking office, Park restructured the Blue House and government organization to carry out her administrative vision. The Office of National Security at the Blue House, Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, and Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries were newly launched, and the seat of Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs was revived. The Chief of the National Security Office would act as a "control tower" for diplomatic, security, and national defense issues, and the Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs for economic, social, and welfare issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.dongascience.com/PHP/NewsView.php?kisaid=20130116100000000656&amp;classcode=0101|title=THE SCIENCE : [박근혜정부 조직개편안]미래部, 성장동력 창출… 부총리는 정책 총괄|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Foreign policy ====

===== United States =====
[[File:Park Geun-Hye meeting with Barack Obama.jpg|thumb|Park Geun-hye at a bilateral meeting with [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] on 7 May 2013]]
After taking office, Park met with John Kerry and U.S. President Barack Obama. Park's trip to the United States in May 2013 was her first foreign trip after taking office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wilson |first1=Scott |last2=DeYoung |first2=Karen |date=7 May 2013 |title=Obama, South Korea's Park present united front against North Korea at joint appearance |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-south-koreas-park-present-united-front-against-north-korea-at-joint-appearance/2013/05/07/e06767f8-b743-11e2-92f3-f291801936b8_story.html |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many of her predecessors, Park has maintained a close relationship with the U.S., which has over [[United States Forces Korea|20,000 soldiers stationed in South Korea]]. During her visit to the U.S., she addressed a joint session of the U.S. Congress, where she called for a united front against any North Korean provocations. Park also called for a strong global relationship between South Korea and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sbs.co.kr/section_news/news_read.jsp?news_id=N1001774050|title=SBS 뉴스 :: 리다이렉트 페이지|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Park assesses the security situation on the Korean Peninsula and emphasized that deterrence capabilities were the most important factor for security. Thus, Park considers the American-South Korean alliance as the most successful one in the world. And she hopes the American-South Korean relationship can be upgraded from a comprehensive strategic alliance to a global partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Policies/view?articleID=113093|title=Korea.net : The official website of the Republic of Korea|author=Korean Culture and Information Service (KOCIS)|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Park visited the United States on her first overseas trip as president. She traveled to Washington, D.C., New York City, and Los Angeles on 5–9 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.president.go.kr/pre_activity/latest/latest_view.php?uno=7800 |title=THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA CHEONG WA DAE |publisher= |accessdate=16 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203194837/http://english.president.go.kr/pre_activity/latest/latest_view.php?uno=7800 |archivedate= 3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During summit talks in May at the White House, Presidents Park and Obama adopted a joint declaration for the American-South Korean alliance and discussed ways to further develop the bilateral relations in a future-forward manner. Also, two leaders discussed ways to promote cooperation in building peace in the Northeast Asian region and strength the partnership between Seoul and Washington.&lt;ref name="korea.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Policies/view?articleID=107794|title=Korea.net : The official website of the Republic of Korea|author=Korean Culture and Information Service (KOCIS)|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two leaders of South Korea and the United States agreed to adopt a joint statement on comprehensive energy cooperation to build a foundation for a future growth engine and establish a policy cooperation committee on information and communication technology. In addition, President Park urged her U.S. counterpart to expand the annual U.S. visa quota for South Korean professionals in order to promote co-development of both economies.&lt;ref name="korea.net" /&gt;

In particular, the "Joint declaration in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the Alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States of America" adopted by South Korea and the United States will become a meaningful document looking back at the past six decades of the alliance and spelling out a new direction for the development of bilateral relations over the coming decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.president.go.kr/pre_activity/speeches/speeches_view.php?board_no=E03&amp;uno=7820 |title=THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA CHEONG WA DAE |publisher= |accessdate=16 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204055451/http://english.president.go.kr/pre_activity/speeches/speeches_view.php?board_no=E03&amp;uno=7820 |archivedate= 4 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== North Korea =====
North Korea had engaged in provocations such as violating a UN Security Council resolution and firing a long-range missile on 12 December 2012, just before 19 December presidential election. After Park was elected, North Korea conducted its third nuclear test 12 February 2013, nullified the non-aggression agreements between the two countries on 8 March and withdrew North Korean workers from the Kaesong Industrial Complex on 8 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15278612 | work=BBC News | title=North Korea profile | date=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Park maintained her stance that South Korea will not succumb to the North's provocations and threats, and will endeavor to elicit policy coordination towards North Korea with major powers such as the United States, China and the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/04/the-us-should-support-new-south-korean-presidents-approach-to-north-korea|title=South Korean President Park Geun-hye's North Korean Strategy|work=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her response to North Korean issues gained the support of many South Koreans and also the United States, China, and Russia, and played a significant role in the unanimous adoption by the UN Security Council of Resolution 2094 regarding North Korea on 7 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csis.org/publication/un-security-council-passes-new-resolution-2094-north-korea|title=UN Security Council Passes New Resolution 2094 on North Korea|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Park's response and the international community's actions, on 6 June North Korea ceased provocations and threats towards the South and suggested holding discussions on reopening the Kaesong Industrial Complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2013/06/06/0200000000AKR20130606082000014.HTML|title=北, 남북 당국간 회담 전격 제의…정부 '수용'|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Park said that peace and unification on the Korean peninsula is the wish of all 70 million Koreans and that as president she will do her utmost to meet such a goal. As well, "the ultimate objective of reunification efforts is to improve the quality of life of people in both Koreas, to further expand freedom and human rights, and [from there] build a prosperous Korean Peninsula."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34876444|title=North and South Korea to hold talks next week|publisher=BBC|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later stated, "to open a new era of peace and hope on the peninsula, North Korea needs to accept her administration's trust building policy initiative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2013/06/06/25/0301000000AEN20130606002500315F.HTML|title=(LEAD) S.

Park's policy vision and initiative on issues concerning North Korea and unification are reflected in her Korean Peninsula Trust-building Process. The Ministry of Unification has announced a new vision statement "realizing a new unified Korea that ensures everyone's happiness". The administrative tasks for this cause include normalizing inter-Korean relations through a trust-building process, embarking on small-scale unification projects that will lead to a complete integration of the two Koreas, and taking practical measures to prepare for unification by strengthening unification capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.unikorea.go.kr/CmsWeb/viewPage.req?idx=PG0000000694|title=unikorea|first=|last=asadal|publisher=eng.unikorea.go.kr}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Park, peaceful unification will be achieved in a three-stage unification initiative: starting from securing peace, going through economic integration, and finally reaching political integration. To achieve sustainable peace by the initiative, the new administration will offer humanitarian assistance for the people in North Korea, inter-Korean exchange and cooperation in economic, social and cultural areas, and will apply 'Vision Korea project' for establishing a single economic community in the Korean Peninsula, conditioned on sufficient mutual trust and progress in denuclearizing North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csis.org/publication/trust-underlying-philosophy-park-geun-hye-administration|title=Trust - The Underlying Philosophy of the Park Geun-Hye Administration|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Russia =====
On 13 November 2013, Park held an extended summit with President Vladimir Putin, whose visit to South Korea was the first among leaders of 4 major powers including the United States, China, and Japan. During the summit, Park and Putin had a comprehensive and productive dialogue with focus on improving economic relations such as logistics cooperation projects (through Russia and North Korea), expanding people-to-people exchanges, and strengthening political ties between South Korea and Russia. Park, especially, emphasized on making preparations to produce an outcome that corresponds to common interests by combining Korea's Eurasian Initiative and Russia's Asia-Pacific Policy. After the summit, both presidents issued a joint communique and held a joint press conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2013/11/12/10/0301000000AEN20131112007053315F.html|title=(3rd LD) S.

It marked the first Korea-Russia summit talk since Park's inauguration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2013/09/07/13/0200000000AEN20130907000100315F.html|title=Park seeks Russia's support in resolving North Korean nuclear standoff|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Park met with Russian Minister for the Development of Russian Far East Viktor Ishaev, who headed the Russian delegation to Park's inaugural ceremony, she stated that Russia is one of Korea's key strategic partners, and the successful launch of the Naro rocket is the outcome of mutually beneficial relations and demonstrates that relations will grow stronger in the future. She also noted that Russia's active participation in the six-party talks will contribute to alleviating tension on the Korean Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rg.ru/2013/02/26/reg-dfo/ishaev-anons.html|title=Виктор Ишаев пригласил корейцев к совместному освоению космоса|work=Российская газета|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economic policy ====
Park announced her plan to build a "Creative Economy" on 5 June 2013, representing her vision for economic revival and job creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msip.go.kr/UserBbs_bbsDetail.action?bbsId%3D72%26bbsNo%3D810%26bbsType%3Ddefault%26manuId%3D128%26insteadMenuId%3D0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819054534/http://www.msip.go.kr/UserBbs_bbsDetail.action?bbsId=72 |archivedate=19 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, Park said "Timing is very important for our economic policy, jobs and livelihood mainly ordinary people should organize a supplementary budget in a timely manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=034&amp;aid=0002478911|title = 박근혜 대통령, "일자리·서민 위주로 조속히 추경 편성"|date = 3 April 2013|accessdate = 3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social policy ====
Park has proposed as one item on the national agenda the eradication of "Four Major Social Evils" (사 대회악:
"sa dae hwe ak")&amp;nbsp;– sexual violence, domestic violence, school violence and unsafe food. Statistics show that sexual violence and domestic violence are increasing in these years.

==== Foreign policy ====

===== North Korea =====
Park proposed three steps to North Korea to help move toward the reunification of the Korean Peninsula, on 28 March in Dresden during her state visit to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-25/park-looks-to-once-divided-germany-to-spur-korean-reunification.html|title=Park Says Once-Divided Germany Is Model for Korea Reunification|date=26 March 2014|work=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
And marking the Korean Peninsula's liberation from Japan's colonial rule Friday (8.15), President Park said, as anguish from the two Koreas' separation passes from one generation to the next, abnormalities on the divided peninsula have become the norm. The South Korean president then highlighted the urgent need to increase understanding and to help merge the lives of South and North Koreans for reunification. "Starting with jointly managing rivers and forests running through the two Koreas, we need to expand joint projects that benefit both sides. In that respect, I hope North Korea will attend the UN Convention on Biological Diversity conference to be held in South Korean city of Pyeongchang in October."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arirang.co.kr/News/News_View.asp?nSeq=166779|title=News View - The World On Arirang|author=arirang, Arirang International Broadcasting Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
President Park Geun-hye has warned that a new nuclear test by North Korea could lead to, "a nuclear domino effect", that might provide its neighbors with a pretext to arm themselves with nuclear weapons, as she sat down with Wall Street Journal Managing Editor Gerard Baker in Seoul on 28 May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/south-korean-president-warns-regional-domino-effect-if-north-detonates-nuke-device S.

==== Government restructuring ====
On 18 May 2014, Park announced South Korea's "plans to break up its coastguard" after failing to respond well during the [[sinking of MV Sewol|MV ''Sewol'' ferry disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27465378#TWEET1132272 |title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;— South Korea to break up coastguard after ferry disaster |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Park, "investigation and information roles would be transferred to the South Korea National Police while the rescue and salvage operation and ocean security roles would be transferred to the Department for National Safety, not to be confused with the Korean [[Ministry of Security and Public Administration]], which will be newly established".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/18/world/asia/south-korea-coast-guard/|title=South Korean president dismantles coast guard after ferry disaster|author=K.J.

On 19 November 2014, the [[Korea Coast Guard]] and [[National Emergency Management Agency]] ceased control as the [[Ministry of Public Safety and Security]] was founded at the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=18 November 2014 |title=South Korea launches new safety agency |url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-south-korea-launches-new-safety-agency-2014nov18-story.html |work=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]] |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2016 general elections ====

Park suffered a serious setback in the [[South Korean legislative election, 2016|2016 general elections]] on 13 April 2016, as the Saenuri Party lost both its majority and its status as first party in the National Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/1935845/south-korean-election-setback-deals-severe-blow-president-park|title=South Korean election setback deals severe blow to President Park Geun-hye's economic reform agenda|newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=14 April 2016|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Park had been criticized for her involvement in the elections and the party's nomination process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/03/116_200839.html|title=Park's election meddling may backfire|newspaper=[[The Korea Times]]|date=21 March 2016|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/03/116_201181.html|title=Park may stay in power after 2018|newspaper=[[The Korea Times]]|date=25 March 2016|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other Saenuri members blamed the pro-Park faction in the party for the defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/04/116_202637.html|title= Saenuri's defeat brewing political upheaval|newspaper=[[The Korea Times]]|date=14 April 2016|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Park loyalists fared badly in constituency elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/04/116_202549.html|title=Park loyalists tumble|newspaper=[[The Korea Times]]|date=13 April 2016|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was seen to hinder the chances of Park's passing her proposed economic reforms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/conservative-rout-leaves-south-koreas-park-geunhye-a-lame-duck/news-story/16ca1208ddd42854cf92dae327574176?nk=c07dd96332972d39c73e50067a02b460-1460645891|title=Conservative rout leaves South Korea's Park Geun-hye a lame duck|newspaper=[[The Australian]]|date=14 April 2016|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the aftermath of the results the conservative ''[[The Chosun Ilbo]]'' stated that Park's "lame duck period has started earlier than any other administration in the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-election-idUSKCN0XA2LC|title=Vote defeat for South Korea's Park raises 'lame duck' prospect|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=14 April 2016|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approval ratings ===
[[File:Park Geun-hye Presidential Approval Rating.svg|thumbnail|right|Park Geun-hye's Presidential Job Approval Rating]]
[[File:Park Geun-hye Approval ratings by age.svg|thumb|right|Approval ratings by age]]
In July 2013, public support for Park's method of governing state affairs reached up to 63 percent, much higher than the percentage of the votes she had won in the presidential election, which is 52 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.co.kr/gallupdb/reportContent.asp?seqNo=449|title=한국갤럽조사연구소|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Korean media explained that such a high level of support comes from Park's principled North Korea policy, constructive outcome from visits to the United States and China, and distancing away from internal political disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mt.co.kr/view/mtview.php?type=1&amp;no=2013070515551873288&amp;outlink=1|title=朴대통령, 지지율 63% 급반등···취임후 최고|author=MoneyToday|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By January 2015, Park's approval rating had fallen to 30 percent, partly due to the [[sinking of MV Sewol|sinking of MV ''Sewol'']] and disputes with North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2015/01/116_172335.html|title=Park's popularity hits new low|date=23 January 2015|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 2015, Park's approval had increased to 54 percent due to her diplomacy that defused a military standoff with North Korea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-04/south-korea-president-park-s-approval-highest-in-year-and-a-half |title=South Korea President Park's Approval Highest in Year-and-a-Half|date= 3 September 2015 |accessdate= 29 December 2015|publisher=bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the aftermath of her party's 2016 election loss, her ratings fell back to 31.5 percent, plunging 8.1 percentage points compared to the week before the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/04/116_202869.html |title=Park and Saenuri's approval ratings dip to new lows |newspaper=[[The Korea Times]] |date=18 April 2016 |accessdate=19 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504210254/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/04/116_202869.html |archivedate=4 May 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November 2016, Park's ratings fell to 4–5% as details of her relationship with [[Choi Soon-sil]] were investigated and exposed in what became the [[2016 South Korean political scandal]].&lt;ref name=Gallup2016111/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/south-koreas-presidency-on-the-brink-of-collapse-as-scandal-grows/2016/10/28/7639a2cc-1700-4ef7-a3a4-661b3ff989c4_story.html|title=South Korea's presidency 'on the brink of collapse' as scandal grows|date=29 October 2016|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sports.khan.co.kr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.khan.co.kr/culture/sk_index.html?art_id=201612021024003&amp;sec_id=560901|title=한국갤럽 여론조사, 박근혜 대통령 지지율 4%|date=2 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial===

Prosecutors sought a 30-year jail term for Park, along with a fine of {{currency|118500000000|KRW}} ({{US$|110579397|link=yes}}).

On 6 April 2018, a three-judge panel of the Central District Court in Seoul sentenced Park to 24 years in prison and a fine of {{currency|18000000000|KRW}} ({{US$|16,798,683|link=yes}}), finding her guilty of 16 out of 18 charges brought before her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-politics-park/south-korean-prosecutors-seek-30-years-jail-for-ousted-park-as-supporters-demand-her-release-idUSKCN1GB0FJ |publisher=[[Reuters]] |title=South Korean prosecutors seek 30 years' jail for ousted Park as supporters demand her release |date=February 27, 2018 |first=Hyonhee |last=Shin |first2=Heekyong |last2=Yang |first3=Christine |last3=Kim |editor-first=Nick |editor-last=Macfie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2018/04/356_246875.html| title=Court orders 24 years in jail for former President Park| first=Kim| last=Se-jeong| publisher=[[Korea Times]]| date=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Choe Sang-hun |date=6 April 2018 |title=Park Geun-hye, South Korea’s Ousted President, Gets 24 Years in Prison |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/world/asia/park-geun-hye-south-korea.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/06/asia/south-korea-park-geun-hye-corruption-intl/index.html?sr=fbCNN040618south-korea-park-geun-hye-corruption-intl0810AMStory|title=Former South Korean President Park Geun-hye sentenced to 24 years in prison|first=Paula Hancocks, Yoonjung Seo and James Griffiths,|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018 three former [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|NIS]] directors (Lee Byung-kee, Lee Byung-ho, and Nam Jae-joon) who served in the Park administration were found guilty of bribing, related to the [[2016 South Korean political scandal|2016 Park Geun-hye scandals]]. They illegally transferred money from the NIS budget to Park's presidential office. This illegally obtained money was used by Park and her associates for private use and to pay bribes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/06/15/asia-pacific/south-korea-jails-ex-spy-chiefs-bribing-former-president-park-geun-hye/ .

== Controversies ==

=== Parentage controversy ===
Park had been often criticized for being the "daughter of a dictator ([[Park Chung-hee]])"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=003&amp;aid=0003762812|script-title=ko:이해찬 "野 총선승리 시 박근혜 별명은 '독재자의 딸'"|trans-title= Lee Hae-chan, "If the oppositions win the legislative election, Park Geun-hye's nickname will change (from Queen of election) to daughter of a dictator"|date=24 March 2011|accessdate=16 May 2012|language=Korean|work=NewsIs|author=Chang Jin-bok(장진복)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newshankuk.com/news/content.asp?news_idx=2011011017184489054|script-title=ko:손학규 "누가 뭐래도 박근혜는 박정희의 딸"|trans-title=Sohn Hak-kyu, "No one can deny Park Geun-hye is the daughter of dictator Park Jeonghui"|date=10 January 2011|accessdate=16 May 2012|work=News Hankook|author=Ko Dong-seok(고동석)|language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for not actively supporting the Lee administration by supporters of Lee Myung-bak. A national-level poll conducted in July 2012 by a conservative newspaper reported that 59% of participants responded they did not believe Park was a "daughter of a dictator" while 36% agreed with the characterization.&lt;ref&gt;{{ko icon}} [http://news.donga.com/3/all/20120716/47788962/1 2012 Donga Ilbo article]&lt;/ref&gt; Park Chung-Hee's status as a dictator became a contested topic after the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis.  GNP party elites saw this as their chance to revitalize Park Chung-Hee's image, focusing on South Korea's economic growth during his administration, thus steadily changing his public perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Young-Im|date=2016-07-21|title=From first daughter to first lady to first woman president: Park Geun-Hye’s path to the South Korean presidency|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14680777.2016.1213307|journal=Feminist Media Studies|language=en|volume=17|issue=3|pages=377–391|doi=10.1080/14680777.2016.1213307|issn=1468-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

During a recent interview with the [[Cheongju]] broadcast station ''[[Cheongju Broadcasting|CJB]]'', Park commented regarding her stance that her father's [[May 16 coup]] was a "revolution to save the country" by stating, "I don't think it's the place of politicians to be fighting over whether [the events of 1961] were a 'coup d'etat' or a 'revolution'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/546402.html|title=Was it a 'coup' or a 'revolution'?|date=9 August 2012|accessdate=9 August 2012|work=[[The Hankyoreh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a July 2012 survey, 50% of respondents answered that they disagreed with Park's assessment that her father's 1961 coup was "unavoidable, the best possible choice, and an advisable decision", as opposed to 37% that agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/544829.html|title=An leading Park in latest polls|date=30 July 2012|accessdate=9 August 2012|work=[[The Hankyoreh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From another survey conducted in July 2012, 42% of respondents agreed with her opinion that her father's 1961 coup was "unavoidable", while 46% disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.co.kr/gallupdb/reportContent.asp?seqNo=312&amp;pagepos=1&amp;search=&amp;searchKeyword=&amp;selectYear=|title=한국갤럽조사연구소|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Park inherited strong regional and generational support from her father, as well as the legacy of his economic success, Park's opponents used her father as criticism against her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Young-Im|date=2016-07-21|title=From first daughter to first lady to first woman president: Park Geun-Hye’s path to the South Korean presidency|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14680777.2016.1213307|journal=Feminist Media Studies|language=en|volume=17|issue=3|pages=377–391|doi=10.1080/14680777.2016.1213307|issn=1468-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bu-il foundation accusations ===
Park has faced much scrutiny over an educational foundation, Jeongsoo Scholarship Foundation, formerly known as Buil (in reference to the stock it controls in the newspaper "[[Busan Ilbo]]"), which her father, and later she, headed.

A [[Liberty Korea Party|Saenuri Party]] assemblyman [[Nam Kyung-pil]] criticized the Park-centered nature of the party, regarding its preparation for the [[South Korean presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]], and stated, "If we keep seeing the same situation where Park Geun-hye gives a press conference before a general meeting of lawmakers is held, and what she says then gets decided on as the party's position, then the public is going to think democracy has disappeared from the party."&lt;ref name="Hankyoreh-2012"&gt;{{cite news |author=Seong Yeon-cheol |date=16 July 2012 |title=Park Geun-hye's flip flopping and double-talking |url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/542691.html |work=[[The Hankyoreh]] |accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, some have said Park's behavior in the lead-up to [[South Korean presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]] was a mixture of trend-following and corner-cutting—a stark contrast with the vehement insistence on principle that she showed when she opposed a revision of the plan for a multifunctional administrative city in [[Sejong City]]. For instance, [[Yim Tae-hee]], another presidential candidate of the party, pointed to Park's voting down of a motion to arrest [[Chung Doo-un]], a lawmaker implicated with bribery related to saving banks. Another candidate, [[Ahn Sang-soo (born May 1946)|Ahn Sang-soo]], accused Park of "saying one thing yesterday and another today".&lt;ref name="Hankyoreh-2012"/&gt;

=== Spokesman scandal ===
{{further|Yoon Chang-jung}}
Park fired [[Yoon Chang-jung]], a [[Blue House]] spokesman who was alleged by [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia|Washington police]] to have committed sexual assault against a young woman hired as an intern at the [[Embassy of South Korea, Washington, D.C.|South Korean Embassy in Washington]] during President Park's first visit to the United States.&lt;ref name=ny20130511&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/world/asia/spokesman-for-south-korean-leader-quits.html | publisher=[[New York Times]] | title= South Korean President Fires Spokesman for 'Unsavory Act' During Visit to U.S. |first=SANG-HUN|last=CHOE| date=10 May 2013 | accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Election-meddling scandal ===
{{Main|2012 NIS public opinion manipulation scandal}}
{{Update|section|date=November 2016}}
Just a week before the presidential election date, the opposing party alleged that the public servants from National Intelligence Service (NIS) have organized to promote Park's election campaign by way of posting online articles favorable to Park and slanderous to the opposing candidates.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} This political behavior by public servants is strictly prohibited by Korean Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://korea.assembly.go.kr/res/low_01_read.jsp?boardid=1000000035 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710041912/http://korea.assembly.go.kr/res/low_01_read.jsp?boardid=1000000035 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 July 2012 |title=Constitution of the Republic of Korea }}&lt;/ref&gt;
To prove their allegation, the opposing Democratic Party, along with the police and Central Election Assistance Commission, swooped in the house where the alleged agent of NIS has resided.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} From there, the 29-year-old female agent, later known as Ha-Young Kim, who was running an illegal online election campaign operation such as spreading slanderous postings about the opposing candidate had locked herself in.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The police could not force to enter the house and the standoff lasted for three days, provoking a tense political standoff.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The opposition accused the intelligence service of blocking an investigation.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Park and her party accused the opposition of harassing the woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/world/asia/south-korean-intelligence-officers-are-accused-of-political-meddling.html?_r=0 | title= South Korean Intelligence Officers Are Accused of Political Meddling | work=The New York Times | first=Choe | last=Sang-Hun | date=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Park even said the standoff of the self-lock-in was a violation of a female right in the presidential candidate debate that took place three days before the election.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Later that night of the presidential debate, Kim Yong-pan, then the chief of Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, publicly announced there was no evidence of illegal online postings from the collected laptop of the female agent.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} This announcement, which took place three days before the election, was believed to have significantly affected the outcome of the presidential election according to the opposing party.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
After months of probes into the alleged election meddling, the prosecution concluded in mid-June 2013 that Won Sei-hoon, then NIS chief who headed the intelligence agency for around four years under former President Lee Myung-bak, ordered agents to conduct online smear campaign against opposition presidential candidates.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The special investigation drew a conclusion that the agents systemically intervened in domestic politics by writing thousands of postings on politics in cyberspace through hundreds of different user IDs.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}  Kim Yong-pan, then chief of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency (SMPA), was prosecuted without physical detention on charges of abusing his authority to hamper police investigation into the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.philstar.com/world/2013/08/11/1078601/news-analysis-skorea-rattled-spy-agencys-political-interference | title= News Analysis: SKorea rattled by spy agency's political interference}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCTV conversation between the computer analysts who were analyzing the laptop at police revealed that the police already knew there were illegal online postings against the opposing party's candidates, but the chief of SMPA publicly announced otherwise, an announcement that indicates intentional meddling into the presidential election.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The investigation and the trial at court are on-going, and Park faces a political blow.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} However, the leading Saenuri party along with government leaders has attempted to dodge its political fall-out.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Their effort has involved tipping a rumor to a major conservative media, Chosun Ilbo, about an extramarital child of the Chae Dong-wook, former Prosecutor General, who has approved the prosecution of Won Se-hoon and Kim Yong-pan, which eventually led to his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2013/09/116_142783.html | title= Prosecutor general calls it quits}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yoon Suk-ryul, the director of the special investigation team, which was leading the probe into the election meddling, was fired and returned to his original position, head of Yeoju branch Supreme Prosecutors Office. The investigation of his team has further revealed that the NIS is suspected of having posted 55,689 messages on Twitter for three months until the presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?biid=2013102264948 | title= Prosecutors are swayed by internal conflict and external pressure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether or not the election meddling of the NIS by way of online posts has actually affected the outcome of the presidential election is controversial.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} However, the false announcement by Kim Yong-pan, then chief of the SMPA, has appeared to do so.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Had the police announced honestly, 14% of the electorate who voted for Park said they would have voted for Moon Jae-In, the first runner-up of the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.polinews.co.kr/news/article.html?no=183788 | title= 국정원 경찰수사발표가 대선 결과 영향 52.8%}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of communication ===
Park has been criticized for holding press conferences with questions and answers submitted in advance. As of 11 January 2015, she held press conferences four times since she took office in February 2013. Among the four press conferences, three of them were public speeches without questions and answers. Even in the remaining press conference, the questions were submitted in advance and she read prepared answers. Her opponents labeled her as "No communication" (불통, ''Bultong'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |script-title=ko:대통령 기자회견 |trans-title=Presidential Press Conference |publisher=Jeonbuk Daily |date=11 February 2015 |url=http://www.jjan.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=536421 |language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=News Analysis: Park Geun-hye's first year: principle vs. non-communication |date=25 February 2014 |publisher=Xinhua |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/indepth/2014-02/25/c_133141149.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019050939/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/indepth/2014-02/25/c_133141149.htm |archivedate=19 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== November 2015 protests ===
On 15 November 2015, around 80,000 anti-government protesters clashed with government forces on the streets of Seoul, demanding that Park step down, with many of the protesters chanting "Park Geun-hye, step down". The rally was triggered by Park's adopting business-friendly labour policies and a decision to require middle and high schools to use only state-issued history textbooks in classes starting in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Anti-government protesters rally in South Korea|url = http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/11/anti-government-protesters-clash-police-korea-151114085804263.html|website = www.aljazeera.com|accessdate = 14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; combined with plans to make labour markets more flexible by giving employers more leeway in dismissing workers. Security forces fired tear gas and sprayed water cannons into the crowd when protesters attempted to break through police barricades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = S Korea protesters clash with police in Seoul - BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34820596|website = BBC News|accessdate = 14 November 2015|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Censorship ===
In the wake of the April 2014 capsize of the [[Sinking of MV Sewol|Sewol]] ferry, public outcry arose over the government's handling of the situation.  In response, the Park administration established a commission to monitor and prosecute social media critics of Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

=== Controversy about violating Public Official Election Act ===
On 25 June 2015 Park said that "Betrayal which breaks the trust shouldn't be accepted in politics and this should be punished by election with people's own hands". This mention was aimed to Yu Seungmin who was a member of Saenuri Party. Her mention was criticized by professor [[Jo Guk]] and politician [[Moon Jae-in]] because it had a purpose of losing Yu Seungmin's election which is protected by Public Official Election Act. But the National Election Commission decided not to treat Park's mention as a violation of Public Official Election Act.&lt;ref&gt;Park's mention can be treated as a violation of public official election act http://finance.daum.net/news/news_content.daum?docid=MD20150628171008128 Ruling party floor leader resigns amid party's internal feud / YTN https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvxXJr4PeIE&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Choi Soon-sil scandal and impeachment ===
{{Main|2016 South Korean political scandal}}
{{see also|Impeachment of Park Geun-hye}}
In late October 2016, investigations into Park's relationship with [[Choi Soon-sil]], daughter of the late Church of Eternal Life cult leader and President Park's mentor [[Choi Tae-min]] began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/10/116_216623.html|date=23 October 2016|title=Investigations into 'Choi Soon-sil gate' widening|website=The Korea Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All the Queen's men and women|url=http://graphics.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/Interactives/2017/03/south-korea-scandal-animated/index.html|website=The Straits Times|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several news media including [[JTBC]] and [[the Hankyoreh]] reported that Choi, who has no official government position, had access to confidential documents and information for the president, and acted as a close confidant for the president. Choi and President Park's senior staff including both Ahn Jong-bum and Jeong Ho-sung used their influence to extort ₩77.4 billion (approximately $75 million) from Korean [[chaebol]]s—family-owned large business conglomerates—and set up two culture and sports-related foundations, Mir and K-sports foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/768777.html|title=박 대통령 독대한 대기업들 미르·K 출연금 유독 많았다|date=3 November 2016|publisher=hani.co.kr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/opinion/column/768706.html|title=[안선희의 밑줄 긋기] 재벌들이 피해자라고?|date=3 November 2016|publisher=hani.co.kr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.donga.com/3/00/20161101/81099663/1|title=[단독]"미르-K스포츠재단 모금, 안종범 수석이 지시했다"|publisher=news.donga.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choi is also accused of having influenced [[Ewha Womans University]] to change their admission criteria in order for her daughter [[Chung Yoo-ra]] to be given a place there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCurry|first1=Justin|title='Rasputin-like' friend of South Korean president returns amid protests|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/30/south-korea-rasputin-like-friend-president-park-geun-hye-returns|work=The Guardian|date=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahn Jong-bum and Jeong Ho-sung, top presidential aides, were arrested for abuse of power and helping Choi; they denied wrongdoing and claimed that they were simply following President Park's orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.donga.com/rss/feed/3/all/20161102/81140663/1?gid=81140910&amp;srev=1&amp;regdate=20161103 |title=검찰, 안종범 전 정책조정수석 긴급체포…서울남부구치소로 이송 |publisher=news.donga.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104142326/http://news.donga.com/rss/feed/3/all/20161102/81140663/1?gid=81140910&amp;srev=1&amp;regdate=20161103 |archivedate=4 November 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 October 2016, Park publicly acknowledged her close ties with Choi. On 28 October, Park dismissed key members of her top office staff while her [[#Approval ratings|approval ratings]] fell to 4%.&lt;ref name="sports.khan.co.kr"/&gt; Her approval rating ranged from 1 to 3% for Korean citizens under 60 years of age, while it remained higher, at 13%, for the over 60 age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/Mobile/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0002257639#cb|title=President Park breaks YS's record, approval rating at 5 percent|date=6 November 2016|website=Oh My News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the worst ever approval rate in Korean history and is worse than the 6% approval rating of former President [[Kim Young-sam]], who was widely blamed for forcing the Korean economy into the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]].&lt;ref name=Gallup2016111&gt;{{cite web |title=데일리 오피니언 제234호(2016년 11월 1주) |trans-title=Daily Opinion No. 234 (1 November 2016) |publisher=Gallup Korea |url=http://www.gallup.co.kr/gallupdb/reportContent.asp?seqNo=787&amp;pagePos=1&amp;selectYear=&amp;search=&amp;searchKeyword=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/10/116_217058.html|title=Park orders secretaries to resign over 'Choi Soon-sil scandal'|date=28 October 2016|website=The Korea Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy led to [[2016 South Korean protests|mass protests and rallies]] in October and November 2016 calling for her resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-politics-idUSKCN12T08V|title=Thousands protest in South Korea, demand president quit over scandal|website=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 November, more than 1 million citizens participated in the protests at Gwanghwamun Square close to presidential residence demanding President Park's resignation or impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.kr/2016/11/13/story_n_12936242.html|title='100만명'이 지하철 통계로 증명됐다|publisher=huffingtonpost.kr}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 November, another 1 million people participated in the national protest after Park refused to help in the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nate.com/view/20161120n00937|title=들불로 번진 2주연속 '100만 촛불혁명'…26일 300만 예고|publisher=news.nate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/771080.html|title=Dreaming of a new world, one million candles again burn nationwide|publisher=english.hani.co.kr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:민중총궐기 1112 175616.jpg|thumb|Protest held in November 2016]]
Park then fired a number of her cabinet members and the prime minister. In particular, the sacking of the prime minister [[Hwang Kyo-ahn]] resulted in a controversy, due to the claim that his firing was carried out via a text message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.khan.co.kr/view.html?artid=201611032237025&amp;code=910100|title=Left wings outrage regarding text firing of Hwang Kyo-ahn|website=KyungHyang}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.insight.co.kr/newsRead.php?ArtNo=81335|title=Prime minister Hwang Kyo-ahn 'fired' by president Park via a text message|website=Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Prosecutors' Office of Korea (SPO), in laying charges against Choi and two former presidential aides, have alleged that President Park colluded with the three in certain criminal activities. The president would be questioned by prosecutors, the first time this has occurred with a serving South Korean president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Agence France-Presse|title=Choi-gate prosecutors accuse South Korean president of collusion|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/20/choi-gate-prosecutors-accuse-south-korean-president-of-collusion|work=The Guardian|date=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2016/11/20/2016112000593.html|title=최순실, 딸 친구 부모 민원 들어주고 1000만원 샤넬백 등 5000만원 챙겨|publisher=news.chosun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nate.com/view/20161120n10972|title=檢, 헌정사상 첫 현직 대통령 피의자 입건…"3명과 공모범행"(종합)|publisher=news.nate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the scandal, there were a series of massive demonstrations that started in the first week of November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/article/south-koreas-president-park-beast-public-sentiment/|title=South Korea's President Park and the beast of public sentiment|last=Breen|first=Michael|date=29 November 2016|website=www.atimes.com|publisher=|access-date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 November 2016, Park offered to resign as President, and invited the National Assembly to arrange a transfer of power. The opposition parties rejected the offer, accusing Park of attempting to avoid the process of impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCurry|first1=Justin|title=South Korea's president calls on parliament to arrange her exit|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/29/south-koreas-president-calls-on-parliament-to-arrange-her-exit|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=29 November 2016|date=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Assembly instead filed a motion for impeachment, which was put to a vote on 9 December 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Agence France-Presse]]|title=South Korean president Park Geun-Hye to face impeachment vote|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/03/south-korean-president-park-geun-hye-to-face-impeachment-vote|website=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=3 December 2016|date=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and passed with 234 supports.&lt;ref name="nyt-impeachments"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sang-hun|first1=Choe|title=South Korea Parliament Votes to Impeach President Park Geun-hye|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeached.html|accessdate=9 December 2016|work=The New York Times|date=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Joo|first1=Youngjae|title=[속보]박근혜 대통령 탄핵소추안 가결···찬성 234·반대 56·무효 7·기권 2|url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201612091610001&amp;code=940100|accessdate=9 December 2016|work=Kyunghyang|date=9 December 2016|language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/southkorea-politics-idINKBN13X2JQ|title=South Korean parliament votes overwhelmingly to impeach President Park|first1=Ju-min|last1=Park|first2=Jack|last2=Kim|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the ratification of her [[Impeachment of Park Geun-hye|impeachment proposal]], her presidential powers and duties were suspended, and Prime Minister [[Hwang Kyo-ahn]] assumed those powers and duties as Acting President.&lt;ref name="Yonhap"/&gt;

'''''Pump Up the Jam''''' (also known as '''''Pump Up the Jam: The Album''''' in North America) is the debut [[studio album]] by Belgian dance act [[Technotronic]]. It was released on 28 November 1989. When it was discovered that model Felly [[Lip sync|lip-synched]] to vocals that were actually performed by Belgian [[Rapper|emcee]] [[Ya Kid K]], the album's artwork, which had featured a picture of Felly, was changed to feature Ya Kid K instead. The album reached number 2 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].&lt;ref name="OCC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/technotronic/|title=TECHNOTRONIC &amp;#124; Artist &amp;#124; Official Charts|work=[[Official Charts Company]]|publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3617">'''Relief 2.0''' or '''disaster relief 2.0''' is the deployment of [[digital information]] techniques in the management of [[disaster relief]].

== History ==
The first large-scale use of modern digital information techniques was by technology experts and volunteers responding to the [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina disaster]] in 2005 in the USA.

Further notable developments came in the disasters that followed, in particular the 7.0MW [[2010 Haiti earthquake|earthquake in Haiti]] on January 12, 2010 and the 9.0MW [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake and tsunami in Japan]] on March 11, 2011. In Japan, a disaster relief organization was created under the name "Relief 2.0".&lt;ref name="Low2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robin Low|title=Good Intentions Are Not Enough: Why We Fail at Helping Others|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gmltDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127|date=18 October 2016|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-320-059-3|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academia involvement ===
Following the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, a group of fellows, academics, technology experts and emergency response volunteers organized a Relief 2.0 workshop at [[Stanford University]] in February 2010 to collect and organize the lessons learned in the field in Haiti. These lessons were further researched and worked on at the [[National University of Singapore]] Entrepreneurship Centre in collaboration with the Stanford University Peace Innovation Laboratory and later tested in the field in the [[Tōhoku Region]] of Japan after the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami of 2011. The findings were presented at [[Kyushu University]] in Fukuoka, Japan in April 2010 during the TEDxEarthquake9.0 conference.

=== International organization reports ===
In April 2011, the report "Disaster Relief 2.0: The Future of Humanitarian Information Sharing" report was presented at the US Mission to the UN in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unocha.org/top-stories/all-stories/disaster-relief-20-future-information-sharing-humanitarian-emergencies "Disaster Relief 2.0: The Future of Humanitarian Information Sharing"], UN OCHA&lt;/ref&gt; It was prepared by the [[Harvard Humanitarian Initiative]], in cooperation with the [[United Nations Foundation]], [[Vodafone Foundation]] and the [[UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (UN OCHA). This report highlighted the role of mass participation using [[mobile communication]]s, [[social media]] and [[crisis mapping]] to pinpoint the most urgent needs following a disaster.&lt;ref name="Ali2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shahla F. Ali|title=Governing Disasters: Engaging Local Populations in Humanitarian Relief|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dQnPDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA232|date=13 June 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-316-59845-0|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools ==
There are a number of tools, toolkits and specific platforms available and used in the practice of Relief 2.0, including [[Ushahidi]] Crowdmap, [[Frontline SMS]], [[OpenStreetMap]]s, [[Sahana FOSS Disaster Management System]] and [[Crisis Maps]].

== Private groups ==
Several private, government funded and non-profit groups have emerged in recent years to advance the practice of Relief 2.0, increase preparedness and the effectiveness of disaster response at a local and a global level. These include: [http://crisismappers.net/ Crisis Mappers],  [http://www.standbytaskforce.org/ Standby Task Force], [https://sempo.ai Sempo],  [[Digital Humanitarian Network]] and Relief 2.0 Inc.

== Mumbai attacks ==

Date attracted international attention during the [[November 2008 Mumbai attacks]] because of his actions resisting terrorists at the [[Cama Hospital|Cama and Albless Hospital]] for women and children, where he was seriously wounded. Responding to Date's call to Police Headquarters for backup, [[Ashok Kamte]], [[Hemant Karkare]], [[Vijay Salaskar]] and four constables were ambushed ''[[wikt:en route|en route]]'' by two terrorists.

On 5 July 2012, [[WikiLeaks]] began publishing what it called the '''Syria Files''', a collection of more than two million emails from [[Syria]]n political figures and ministries and from companies including [[Finmeccanica]]&lt;ref name="Telegraph_Finmeccanica5Jul2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ThReut_Finmeccanica5Jul2012" /&gt; and [[Brown Lloyd James]]&lt;ref name="Ynet_BrownLloydJames" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FP_BrownLloydJames" /&gt; dating from August 2006 to March 2012.&lt;ref name="syriafiles_bbc" /&gt;

== Release ==
The release of the files started on 5 July 2012.&lt;ref name="syriafiles_bbc" /&gt; The database comprises 2,434,899 emails from 680 domains.&lt;ref name="syriafiles_bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="syriafiles_home" /&gt; At least 400,000 files are in Arabic and 68,000 files in Russian.&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt; Media organisations working with WikiLeaks on the release include the Lebanese daily ''[[Al Akhbar (Lebanon)|Al Akhbar]]'', the Egyptian daily ''[[Al-masry Al-youm|Al-Masry Al-Youm]]'', the Italian weekly ''[[L'espresso]]'', the German public radio and television broadcaster [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR)]] of the [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] consortium, the French information website [[:fr:OWNI|OWNI]] and the Spanish website [[Público (Spain)|Público]].&lt;ref name="NationPak_mediapartners" /&gt; The [[New York City]] based [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] news agency [[Associated Press]] (AP) was initially announced by WikiLeaks to be helping with the release. The claim was withdrawn by WikiLeaks and an AP spokesperson stated that AP was "reviewing the emails for possible coverage [and] did not have any advance agreement on how [it] might handle the material."&lt;ref name="Huff_not_AP" /&gt; According to ''[[Al Akhbar (Lebanon)|Al Akhbar]]''{{'}}s analysis, the Syria Files "illuminate—often in small ways—the nature of power within and the inner workings of certain political and economic elements in Syria".&lt;ref name="alakhbar_assadroyals" /&gt; ''Al Akhbar'' states its confidence that "the emails are authentic, that the senders and receivers are mainly who they say they are".&lt;ref name="alakhbar_assadroyals" /&gt;

A [[hacktivism|hacktivist]] group of the [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] collective claimed credit for obtaining the emails and providing them to WikiLeaks. Anonymous stated that it had "worked day and night" in order to access [[server (computing)|computer servers]] in Syria and that "the data available had been so massive that downloading it had taken several weeks." Anonymous gave the data to WikiLeaks because it judged WikiLeaks to be "supremely well equipped to handle a disclosure of this magnitude". Anonymous stated that as long as Bashar al-Assad remains in power, it will continue "to assist the courageous freedom fighters and activists in Syria".&lt;ref name="ZDnet_Anon" /&gt;

==Cases==

===Finmeccanica===
According to emails published by WikiLeaks on 5 July 2012,&lt;ref name="WL_Finmeccanica5Jul2012" /&gt; the Italian conglomerate [[Finmeccanica]] increased its sale of mobile communications equipment to Syrian authorities during 2011, delivering 500 of these to the [[Damascus]] suburb Muadamia in May 2011,&lt;ref name="Telegraph_Finmeccanica5Jul2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Delivery500Radios"/&gt; after the [[Syrian Civil War]] had started, and sending engineers to Damascus in February 2012 to provide training in using the communications equipment in helicopter terminals,&lt;ref name="SELEXreplyFeb2012" /&gt; while the conflict continued.&lt;ref name="ThReut_Finmeccanica5Jul2012" /&gt;

===Brown Lloyd James===
In May 2011, the [[public relations]] firm [[Brown Lloyd James]] sent an email to Syrian authorities "on how to create the appearance it is pursuing reform while repressing the uprising", in [[Ynetnews]]' description of an email&lt;ref name="Syria_Files_2089956" /&gt; published by WikiLeaks on 6 July.&lt;ref name="Ynet_BrownLloydJames" /&gt; Brown Lloyd James advised that "Refocusing the perception of outsiders and Syrians on reform will provide political cover to the generally sympathetic US Government, and will delegitimize critics at home and abroad. In our view, the President needs to communicate more often and with more finely-tuned messaging and the First Lady needs to get in the game. The absence of a public figure as popular, capable, and attuned to the hopes of the people as Her Excellency at such a critical moment is conspicuous. The key is to show strength and sympathy at once."&lt;ref name="FP_BrownLloydJames" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CrisisCommunications" /&gt; The company recommended a public relations campaign to "create a reform 'echo-chamber' by developing media coverage outside of Syria that points to the President's difficult task of wanting reform" so that the "coverage [would] rebound into Syria".&lt;ref name="FP_BrownLloydJames" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CrisisCommunications" /&gt; Brown Lloyd James also recommended "countering ... the daily torrent of criticism and lies" by "[a] 24-hour media monitoring and response system [that] should be in place with assets in UK and US markets; [monitoring] social media sites and [challenging and removing] false sites; and a steady, constantly updated messaging document that contains talking points geared to latest developments."&lt;ref name="FP_BrownLloydJames" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CrisisCommunications" /&gt;

Brown Lloyd James stated that the document was not paid for, was a "'last-ditch' effort 'to encourage a peaceful outcome rather than violence',&lt;ref name="FP_BrownLloydJames" /&gt; and that it was sent to [[Asma al-Assad]], the wife of President [[Bashar al-Assad]].&lt;ref name="Ynet_BrownLloydJames" /&gt;

===Bashar and Asma al-Assad===
On 8 July 2012, ''[[Al Akhbar (Lebanon)|Al Akhbar]]'' presented an analysis of emails by President [[Bashar al-Assad]] and his wife [[Asma al-Assad]]. ''Al Akhbar'' listed the main topics of the al-Assad's Syria Files emails, and stated, "Viewed through the prism of the 'Syria Files', Syria’s first couple appear to be occupied with their representative capacities, with ample time devoted to the state of the palatial gardens, renovations, the stationary needs of low-level employees, but also issues related to bolstering the couple’s image, be it via charitable efforts or through political favors. During the first year of the uprising covered by the emails in the cache, the official and unofficial correspondence of the First Couple and ministry of presidential affairs present only few references to the ongoing tumult&amp;nbsp;.... But there is no real sense of tangible power on behalf of the First Couple present within the 'Syria Files.' What is revealed is only a façade, or perhaps fittingly, a brand calculated to cloak another system: the military-security machine, which remains as of yet tightly in control and far from prying eyes."&lt;ref name="alakhbar_assadroyals" /&gt;

===Rami Makhlouf===
Syria Files examined by ''[[Al Akhbar (Lebanon)|Al Akhbar]]'' show that after businessman [[Rami Makhlouf]] publicly claimed to respond to protestors' demands by "repenting" from business, selling shares and investing his money and time in charity and development projects, he continued to invest in several banks during 2011 and 2012. In late January 2012, he bought about 15 times as much shares (by value) as he sold, buying {{currency|{{format price|1.26576155e8}}|SYP}} and selling {{currency|{{format price|8.666251e6}}|SYP}} of shares, mostly in [[QNB Group|Qatar National Bank–Syria]] and [[Syria International Islamic Bank]].&lt;ref name="alakhbar_makhlouf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="alakhbar_makhlouf22jan2012" /&gt;

==Commentary and reactions==
WikiLeaks leader [[Julian Assange]] said of the files that "it helps us not merely to criticise one group or another, but to understand their interests, actions and thoughts. It is only through understanding this conflict that we can hope to resolve it."&lt;ref name="assange_understanding" /&gt;

==Suppressed documents==
On September 9, 2016, reporters from ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' broke a story describing unsealed U.S. court documents showing that the leaked version of the Syria Files omitted records of a €2 billion transfer from the [[Central Bank of Syria]] to the Russian government-owned [[VTB Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cameron|first1=Dell|last2=O'Neill|first2=Patrick Howell|title=WikiLeaks release excludes evidence of €2 billion transfer from Syria to Russia|url=http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/wikileaks-syria-files-syria-russia-bank-2-billion/|work=The Daily Dot|date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolt==
Multiple Japanese police stations were stormed by Aboriginal and Han Chinese fighters under Chiang Ting (Jiang Ding) and Yü Ch'ing-fang (Yu Qingfang).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070924110630/http://iao.sinica.edu.tw/significant-research-results-pdf/090-094-em19.pdf Governmentality and Its Consequences in Colonial Taiwan: A Case Study of the Ta-pa-ni Incident]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Modern Taiwanese [[historiography]] attempts to portray the Tapani Incident as a nationalist uprising either from a Chinese ([[Chinese reunification|unification]]) or Taiwanese ([[Taiwan independence|independence]]) perspective. Japanese colonial historiography attempted to portray the incident as a large scale instance of banditry led by criminal elements. However, the Tapani Incident differs from other uprisings in Taiwan's history because of its elements of [[millenarianism]] and [[folk religion]], which enabled Yu Qingfang to raise a significant armed force whose members believed themselves to be invulnerable to modern weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Paul R.|title=When Valleys Turned Blood Red: The Tapani Incident in Colonial Taiwan|date=2005|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|pages=110|isbn=9780824829155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The similarities between the rhetoric of the leaders of the Tapani uprising and the [[Righteous Harmony Society]] of the recent [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China were not lost on Japanese colonial authorities, and the colonial government subsequently paid more attention to popular religion and took steps to improve colonial administration in southern Taiwan.

The aboriginals carried on with violent armed struggle against the Japanese while Han Chinese violent opposition stopped after Tapani.&lt;ref name="Crook2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Crook|title=Taiwan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3YOoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=tapani+incident&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lvi2VOm7LIOlgwT_oICQAg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=tapani%20incident&amp;f=false|date=5 June 2014|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-497-6|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial economic collapse which resulted in the [[Great Depression]] can be divided into two parts: 1929 to mid-1931, and then mid-1931 to 1933. The initial decline lasted from mid-1929 to mid-1931. During this time, most people believed that the decline was merely a bad recession, worse than the recessions that occurred in 1923 and 1927, but not as bad as the [[Depression of 1920-21]]. Economic forecasters throughout 1930 cheerily predicted an economic rebound come 1931, and felt vindicated by a stock market rally in the spring of 1930. 

The stock market crash in the first few weeks had a limited direct effect on the broader economy, as only 16% of the U.S. population was invested in the market in any form. But thousands of investors and banks lost money when 10% of invested wealth was lost almost overnight, with prospect of further losses. The crash created uncertainty in people’s minds about the future of the economy. This distrust in future income reduced consumption expenditure.  As demand for commodities decreased, so did their prices.&lt;ref name="Temin"/&gt; However, many banks that had engaged in risky investments in the stock market, and/or had lent money to individuals engaged in trading, suffered balance sheet losses that reduced their capital ratios. Mounting losses from further stock market declines and a worsening macroeconomy would further strain the banking system. Over $34 million in wealth would be lost from the collapses in leverage investment products in 1929 offered by Goldman Sachs alone.

An increasing number of bank failures in late-1930 interrupted the process of credit creation and reduced the money supply, harming consumption. After a second round of banking panics in mid-1931, there was a major change in people’s expectations about the future of the economy.&lt;ref name="Temin"&gt;Temin, Peter. ''Lessons from The Great Depression'', Cambridge:MIT Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-262-70044-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This fear of reduced future income coupled with the [[Federal Reserve System|Fed’s]] deflationary [[monetary policy]] resulted in a deflationary spiral that cratered consumer spending, business investment, and industrial production. This further depressed the economy until [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] stepped into office in 1933 and ended the [[gold standard]], thereby ending the deflationary policy.&lt;ref name="Ben"&gt;Bernanke, Ben S. ''The Federal Reserve Board.'' 2 March 2004.[http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2004/200403022/default.htm "Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke."]&lt;/ref&gt;

A true understanding of the Great Depression requires not only knowledge of the U.S. monetary system but also the implications of the gold standard on its participatory nations. The gold standard made the involved nations interdependent on each other's policies. Due to a [[fixed exchange rate]], the only way to affect the demand for gold was through interest rates. For example, if interest rates were high in one country, then investors would have no reason to exchange currency for gold and the gold reserves would remain stable. However, if interest rates were low in a different country then its investors would elect to move their funds abroad where interest rates were higher.  In order to stop this from happening, each nation within the gold standard union had no choice but to raise its interest rates in correspondence with its fellow nation.&lt;ref name="Ben"/&gt; This interconnectivity of deflationary policy amongst so many nations resulted in the prolongation of the greatest economic downturn.

==1929==
'''January - June:''' the [[Roaring Twenties]] continue unabated. The combined net profits of 536 manufacturing and trading companies showed a 36.6% increase over the same period in 1928, with steel production leading the way. Retail sales, construction starts, and railroad revenues set record after record. Stocks continue to make record gains. An enormous surplus of wheat from 1928 drives down wheat prices, straining commodity markets and farmers' incomes. Unemployment hovers around a robust 4%. US nominal GDP is $105 billion (it would not reach this level again until 1941).

'''March 25th:''' a mini-stock market crash occurs after the Federal Reserve warns of excessive speculation. However, the mini-crash was averted two days later when National City Bank pumped $25 million in credit into the stock market.

'''Summer:''' consumer spending and industrial production begin to stagnate. The Federal Reserve continues with its plan to raise interest rates from 4% in mid-1928 to 6% by mid-1929 in an attempt to combat speculative behavior. 

'''June 15th:''' the [[Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929]] is signed into law, providing some $100 million in emergency loans to struggling farmers

'''May-September:''' the stock market makes almost entirely uninterrupted gains, gaining 20% over this period. 

'''August:''' a minor [[recession]] begins, two months before the Stock Market Crash. Steel production and automobile &amp; house sales notably decline, construction stagnates, and consumer debt was reaching dangerous levels on account of easy credit. Over $8.5 billion of margin loans for stocks were outstanding, worth more than all currency circulating in the United States at the time. 

'''September 3rd:''' Dow Jones peaks at 381.17. The stock market would not regain this peak until November 23rd, 1954. 

'''September 20th:''' The London Stock Exchange crashes after the collapse of Hatry Group on charges of fraud and forgery. £24 million in value is wiped out. The collapse shakes the confidence of American investors in the security of overseas investments. 

'''October 24th:''' [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] begins. Stocks lose over 11% of their value upon the opening bell.

'''October 25th - 27th:''' Brief recovery on the market.

'''October 29th:''' '[[Black Tuesday]]'. U.S. Stock market collapse, the DOW Jones closing down over 12%. 

'''October 30th:''' one day recovery

'''November 1st:''' The [[Federal Reserve]] begins lowering the discount rate from its 6% level.

'''November 13th:''' stock market bottoms out at 198.60, followed by a [[bear market]] that would last until April 1930. Commodity prices, however, continue to decline steeply.

==1930==
'''Year:''' recession deepens. US GDP contracts by 8.5% and nominal GDP falls to $92 billion. Prices decline slightly but wages hold relatively steady. US annual inflation rate is -6.4%. Unemployment reaches 9%. 1,350 banks fail. 

'''April 17th:''' Dow reaches a secondary closing peak (i.e., bear market rally) of 294.07, followed by a long stagnation until a severe decline began in April 1931. This peak matches early-1929 levels, but is 30% below the September 1929 peak. 

'''May:''' Automobile sales fall below 1928 levels.

'''June 17th:''' [[Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act]] passed, placing more stress on the weakening global economy, primarily through the collapse in trade of agricultural products, which strained banks that had lent heavily to farmers. Further decreases in trade of manufactured products led to layoffs and reduced corporate profits, weakening the economy. General consensus among economists is that the Smoot-Hawley Act did not cause the Depression, but did worsen it and stunted recovery efforts after 1933. Exports declined from $5.2 billion in 1929 to just $1.7 billion in 1933. 

'''September - December:'''' First major round of U.S. bank failures. Some $550 million in deposits are lost. Over 300 banks failed in December alone.

'''November:''' Caldwell &amp; Company, a major conglomerate offering banking, insurance, and brokerage services in the Southern United States, collapses and triggered a cascading effect of bank runs on smaller banks in Tennessee and Kentucky. The collapse generates national headlines, contributing to the contagion of fear regarding the banking system. 

'''December:''' The Federal Reserve's federal funds rate reaches 2%, a then-record low.  

'''December:''' [[Bank of United States]] (a private bank in New York City) collapses. The bank had over $160 million in deposits and was the fourth largest bank in the United States at the time, and its failure is widely considered to be the moment when the banking collapse in the United States hit a critical mass, sparking a nationwide run on the banking system that was a major contributor to the deflationary spiral of 1931-1933. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Banking Panics of 1930 - 1933|url=https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/banking_panics_1930_31|website=Federal Reserve History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1931==
[[File:Unemployed men queued outside a depression soup kitchen opened in Chicago by Al Capone, 02-1931 - NARA - 541927.jpg|thumb|Unemployed men outside a soup kitchen in [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], the [[United States|US]], 1931.|upright=1.15]]
'''Year:''' 2,294 banks went down with nearly $1.7 billion in deposits. 28,285 businesses failed for a daily rate of 133 failures in 1931. Unemployment rises to 16%. US nominal GDP falls to $77 billion, and growth is -8.5%. Annual inflation is -9.3%.

'''May 11th:''' [[Creditanstalt]], Austria's premier bank with major stakes across a variety of industries, becomes insolvent after being forced to assume liabilities from three other insolvent banks, triggering a cascading effect of bank failures across Central Europe. Creditanstalt represented 16% of Austria's GDP, and could not find another institution to guarantee liquidity. 140 million Austrian Schillings were lost. The collapse of Creditanstalt caused the Bank of France, the National Bank of Belgium, the Netherlands Bank, and the Swiss National Bank to begin a run on the U.S. Dollar for their gold reserves, and forced the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates from 1.5% to 3.5% to maintain the gold standards, which in turn contributed to the deepening of the Depression and the second round of banking failures in the U.S. during the summer of 1931. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kindleberger|first1=Charles|title=The World in Depression, 1929-1939 (History of the World Economy in the Twentieth Century)|date=1986|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''May:''' The Federal Reserve's federal funds rate bottoms out at 1.5%.

'''May–June:''' Second major round of U.S. bank failures and worsening economic situation contributes to permanent change in people's expectation of the economy. This run was centered on bank in Chicago, which suffered from real estate loan defaults. Of the 193 state-chartered banks in the Chicago area in 1929, only 35 would survive to the end of 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Caused Chicago Bank Failures in the Great Depression? A Look at the 1920s|url=http://eh.net/eha/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Postel-Vinay.pdf|publisher=London School of Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago area banks engaged heavily in real estate lending between 1923 and 1929, and banks that had greater exposure to the real estate bust were very likely to fail. The deflationary spiral that began earlier in the year rapidly and severely intensifies

'''June-July:''' German banking crisis. The Reichsbank loses 840 million marks in less than 3 weeks as investors pull out short-term deposits. Germany's second largest bank, Danatbank, becomes insolvent on July 13th. Two day bank holiday is declared. Industry suffers a catastrophic collapse. The [[Hoover Moratorium]] is issued June 20th, suspending reparation payments from Germany to stabilize the country. Although private banks in New York City and the Bank of England begin emergency lending to Germany, the banking crisis spills over into Hungary and Romania, and the collapse of the economy paves the way for Adolf Hitler's rise in the July 1932 and March 1933 elections. The contagion also puts increasing pressure on the United Kingdom.

'''August''' - deepening deficits and demands for a balanced budget lead to Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government raising taxes by £24 million and cutting spending by £96 million, most controversial was the 20% cut to unemployment benefits (a sum of £64 million). The U.K.'s public debt at the time was 180% of GDP, mostly left over from the expenses of World War One. Public outrage would lead to the Labour Party being virtually destroyed in the October 1931 election. 

'''September 21st:''' Britain leaves the [[gold standard]], and the Pound Sterling depreciates by 25%. Despite warning of disaster, the departure proves beneficial to the British economy, as exports become more competitive. Additionally, the Bank of England was now free to engage in money creation, and reduced interest rates from 6.00% to 2.00%.  

'''October 27th:''' the [[United Kingdom General election, 1931]] takes place, destroying the Labour Party and delivering a landslide victory to the Conservatives. 

'''September - October:''' Substantial amount of dollar assets (primarily Federal Reserve Notes) are converted to gold in the US by European central banks seeking to cover losses from the panic that had been sweeping Europe since the collapse of CreditAnstalt. In response, the Federal Reserve increases the federal funds rate from 1.50% to 3.50% to stabilize the dollar, but this only worsens the Depression as banks are further strained. The New York Fed had loan $150 million in gold (some 240 tons) to European central banks, and the wisdom of this was questioned as European countries rapidly abandoned the gold standard.  As deflation intensified, real interest rates were magnified and rewarded those who held onto money, thus contributing to the deflationary spiral.

==1932==
'''Year''': Unemployment rises to 23%, GDP growth is -13%, annual inflation rate is -11%, 1,700 banks fail. US nominal GDP falls to $60 billion. Over 13 million in the U.S. are unemployed and 3.5 million in the U.K.

'''January 22nd''' - the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] is created to lend $2 billion to troubled financial institutions that were not part of the Federal Reserve System that were solvent in the long-run. By 1941, the RFC would lend out some $9.5 billion to banks, railroads, and mortgage associations, as well as state and local governments. 

'''April''' - June: Federal Reserve conducts [[Open market operations|open market transactions]], increasing the [[money supply]] by $1 billion.

'''Summer 1932''': Majority of foreign [[trade restrictions]] take effect, from Smoot-Hawley in the U.S. and [[Imperial Preference]] in the British Empire

'''June 6th''' - the [[Revenue Act of 1932]] is signed into law, raising taxes on personal income, corporate income, and sales taxes on various goods.

'''July:''' U.S. government discontinues open market operations.

'''July 8th:''' the Dow Jones Industrial Index bottoms out at 41.22, the lowest level recorded in the 20th Century and representing an 89% loss from its peak in September 1929. 

'''July 31st:''' the [[German federal election, July 1932]] is held, and the Nazi Party, led by Adolf Hitler, becomes the largest party in parliament (but lacks a majority)

'''November 6th:''' the [[German federal election, November 1932]], the last free and fair all-German election until 1990, is held. A minor setback for the Nazi Party, a campaign of mass violence and intimidation would begin in the run up to the next election in March 1933. 

'''November 8th:''' [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] elected 32nd President in a landslide, Democrats win massive majorities in both chambers of Congress.

==1933==
'''Year:''' inflation rate turns positive, at 1% annually. Quarterly GDP growth turns positive by summer, but overall annual rate is -1.3% growth. Unemployment peaks at 25%. 2 million are homeless. Industrial production is half of what it was in 1929. US nominal GDP bottoms out at $57 billion (down from $105 billion in 1929)

'''February 14th''': Michigan becomes the first state in the U.S. to declare an indefinite bank holiday, in an attempt to stem the impending collapse of First National Bank of Detroit and the Guardian National Bank of Commerce, the two largest banks in Detroit. First National and Guardian National were threatened with failure if the Ford Motor Company made good on its desire to withdraw all of its deposits in the two banks; Ford needed the cash to cover its $75 million loss in 1932. At this time, over 80% of Detroit's manufacturing capacity laid idle, and over 400,000 people were unemployed. Michigan's bank holiday set off a contagion of fear across the country, and by March 6th an additional 37 states would declare indefinite bank holidays. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1933 Banking Crisis -- from Detroit's Collapse to Roosevelt's Bank Holiday|url=https://www.americanhistoryusa.com/1933-banking-crisis-detroit-collapse-roosevelt-bank-holiday/|website=American History USA|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''March 4th:''' [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] is inaugurated as President.

'''March 5th''' - the [[ German federal election, March 1933]] is held. The Nazi Party would win a narrow majority of seats, but only in coalition with the German National People's Party (DNVP). Though this would be the last free election before World War II, it is not considered to be a fair election, as the Nazi Party's paramilitary organizations waged a campaign of violence, censorship, intimidation, and harassment against all parties that opposed them, as well as surveillance of voting on election day itself. 

'''March 6th''' - [[Executive Order 2009]] suspends all banking activity for one week, in response to renewed stress on major New York City banks that threatened another round of bank failures and further deepening of the Depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bank Holiday of 1933|url=https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/bank_holiday_of_1933|website=Federal Reserve History}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, 38 states had declared bank holidays. 

'''March 9th'''- The [[Emergency Banking Act]] was enacted, which enabled a restructuring of the banking system. Over 4,000 banks with $3.6 billion in deposits that were deemed irreparably insolvent were closed forever, but by March 15th, banks controlling some 90% of the nation's banking activities were back in business. By the end of March, over $1.1 billion in hoarded cash was deposited into the banking system. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emergency Banking Act of 1933|url=https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/emergency_banking_act_of_1933|website=Federal Reserve History}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new deposits saved cash-starved banks and helped restart the money creation process after years of credit contraction. The Act also created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which insured deposits up to $2,500 and helped restore confidence in the banking system. 

'''March 20th''' - the controversial [[Economy Act of 1933]] is signed into law, slashing $243 million in government salaries and pensions, and veterans' benefits. Despite the economic crisis, supermajorities of American economists, policymakers, and the general public believed that the federal government needed to balance the budget and avoid deficit spending, to avoid putting further strain on the bond market which would negatively affect government borrowing costs, banks, corporations, and foreign investors. From 1929 to 1933, the total debt owed by the U.S. government rose from $16.9 billion to over $23 billion. This "Economy" Act was designed to reduce government outlays and assuage fears about government debt and deficits. 

'''March 31st''' - The [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], a public works relief program, is created. It would last until 1942 and is an icon of the New Deal programs. 

'''April 5th''' - [[Executive Order 6102]] of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] issued, forbidding hoarding of gold coin, bullion, and certificates, effective from May 1, 1933

'''May 12th''' - the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] is enacted, designed to boost agricultural prices by reducing surpluses.

'''May 27th''' - the [[Securities Act of 1933]] is enacted, requiring the registration of all sales and purchases of financial securities, as well as the disclosure of critical financial information about the firms involved. The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] was established the following year, which helped combat insider trading and reducing transaction risk.

'''July''' - Federal Reserve industrial production index rebounds to 85.5, a 57% increase over the 54.3 recorded in March 1933

'''November 8th''' - the [[Civil Works Administration]] is created, which would employ over 4 million people and distribute over $400 million in funds for work programs through its end on March 31, 1934, when it would be replaced by the more permanent [[Works Progress Administration]]

'''December 5th''' - [[Prohibition]] is repealed at the national level. 18 states continue with state-level prohibition. The end of Prohibition hurts organized crime, allows legal employment in alcoholic drink production, and increases state tax revenues.

'''Frederick Anthony Owen "Tony" Gaze''', {{postnominals|country=AUS|size=100%|sep=,|DFC2|OAM}} (3 February 1920 – 29 July 2013) was an Australian fighter pilot and racing driver. He flew with the [[Royal Air Force]] in the [[Second World War]], was a [[flying ace]] credited with 12.5 confirmed victories (11 and 3 shared), and later enjoyed a successful racing career in the UK, Europe and Australia.&lt;ref name="telegraph2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10214903/Squadron-Leader-Tony-Gaze.html|title=Squadron Leader Tony Gaze|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=31 July 2002|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Gaze was born in [[Melbourne]], Victoria, on 20 February 1920, the son of [[Irvine Gaze]], a member of the [[Ross Sea Party]] who were preparing for [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/rewind/txt/s1214093.htm|title=Ross Sea Party |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106134142/http://www.abc.net.au/tv/rewind/txt/s1214093.htm |archivedate=6 January 2015 |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|date=19 January 1943|title=Award for Son of Last War Flyer|page=4}} [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11341797]&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Geelong Grammar School]], and when war was declared in September 1939 he was a student at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]].

==Military service==
===First success===
Gaze joined the RAF in 1940, and on completion of training and with 122 hours flying time recorded was posted to [[No. 610 Squadron RAF]] at [[RAF Westhampnett]] in March 1941, flying [[English Channel|cross-channel]] fighter sweeps. Gaze's first 'kill' came on 26 June when he downed a Messerschmitt Bf 109. The next month he claimed two further victories, one half and two probables. For these victories he was awarded the first of three [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]]s. His brother, [[Pilot Officer]] Scott Gaze had joined [[No. 610 Squadron RAF]] with him in early 1941, but was killed in action on 23 March 1941. In November 1941 Gaze was posted to [[No. 57 OTU]] as an instructor.

He started his second tour in June 1942, with [[No. 616 Squadron RAF]], flying the high altitude [[Spitfire PR Mk.IV|Spitfire Mk.IV]]. During the ill-fated [[Dieppe Raid]] on 19 August 1942, he received his second DFC after destroying an enemy fighter. In late August 1942 he was posted to command [[No. 64 Squadron RAF]] flying the new [[Spitfire Mk.IX#Mk IX (type 361)|Spitfire IX]].

===Demotion and escape after being shot down===
On 26 September 1942 Gaze led a wing of Spitfires in support of a bombing raid at [[Morlaix]]. An [[Eagle Squadron]], [[No. 131 Squadron RAF]], became scattered in high winds and lost 11 of 12 fighters. Gaze was made the scapegoat for the mission failure and was transferred back to No. 616 Squadron as a flight commander. It was later determined that the cause of the high losses on that mission were due to pilot inexperience and unexpected adverse weather.

After a rest from operations in early 1943, he was again posted to an operational Squadron in August 1943, [[No. 66 Squadron RAF]] at [[RAF Kenley]]. On 4 September 1943 over [[Le Tréport]] after downing a [[Focke Wulf 190]] Gaze's own Spitfire V was shot down by [[Heinz-Gerhard Vogt]] of II./[[JG 26]] (his 14th claim of an eventual 48). Gaze crash landed 20 miles from [[Dieppe]] with slight injuries, evaded capture and made his way, with help from the [[French Resistance]], to neutral Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2381342/WWII-fighter-ace-godfather-Australian-motor-racing-came-idea-turn-RAF-site-Goodwood-racing-track-dies-aged-93.html|title=Spitfire pilot, racing driver and the man who came up with Glorious Goodwood dies at 93|publisher=[[The Daily Mail]]|date=30 July 2002|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Back to Britain===
In February 1944 Gaze joined the [[Air Fighting Development Unit]] (ADFU) at [[RAF Wittering|Wittering]], rejoining No. 610 Squadron on the continent in July 1944. He claimed a [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] jet shot down near Emmrich on Rhine on 14 February 1945 (a Me 262A-2 of I./[[KG 51]] flown by Rudolf Hoffmann) (the first Australian to achieve this feat) and shared an [[Arado Ar 234]] jet bomber on 12 April 1945.

The Me 262 victory resulted in Gaze being awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for the third time; one of only 47 men in the Second World War.&lt;ref name="telegraph2002"/&gt;

After a month with [[No. 41 Squadron RAF]] in April, on 2 May 1945 he was posted as a flight commander to No. 616 squadron, becoming one of the first Australians (after F/O JN McKay, RAAF)&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph (Brisbane. QLD), Tuesday 22 May 1945, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; to fly the [[Gloster Meteor]] in combat during the closing stages of the war.

During the war he had also flown with some of the most famous names including Wing Commander [[Douglas Bader]], top Allied ace [[Johnnie Johnson (pilot)|Johnnie Johnson]] (38 victories) as part of the RAF's [[Tangmere Wing]] and [[Paul Tibbets]], pilot of the '[[Enola Gay]]', B29 Bomber that dropped the [[Little Boy|atomic bomb on Hiroshima]].

==List of air victories==
Gaze ended the war as Australia's tenth ranking highest [[Flying ace|ace]], claiming 12.5 confirmed destroyed (11 and 3 shared (note: below list includes the destruction of a V1)), 4 probables, and 5 damaged in 488 combat missions, all while flying the Spitfire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ww2awards.com/person/41649|title=Gaze, Frederick Anthony Owen "Tony" |publisher=World War Two Awards|date=|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Gaze suggested to [[Frederick Gordon-Lennox, 9th Duke of Richmond|the Duke of Richmond and Gordon]], better known as “Freddie March”, that the roads around [[RAF Westhampnett]] would be a good location for a racing track. Acting on this suggestion, March opened the [[Goodwood Circuit]] in 1948.&lt;ref name="tonygaze.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonygaze.com|title=Squadron Leader Tony Gaze OAM DFC** (WWII Ace &amp; Grand Prix driver) —|work=tonygaze.com|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodwood.com/sports/flying/latest-news/tony-gaze/|title=Goodwood - Tony Gaze|work=goodwood.com|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaze returned to Australia after the war, and began racing an [[Alta Car and Engineering Company|Alta]] racing car that he brought with him.&lt;ref name="tonygaze.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10214903/Squadron-Leader-Tony-Gaze.html|title=Squadron Leader Tony Gaze|work=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He raced an Alta Formula 2 in Europe for the 1951 season, switching to an [[Hersham and Walton Motors|HWM-Alta]] for the following season, planning to racing again in F2.&lt;ref name="tonygaze.com"/&gt; When the sports governing body decided to change the World Championship regulations from [[Formula One]] to Formula 2,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jackjonesracing.com/2016/04/21/formula-1-whats-in-a-name/|title=Formula 1 – what’s in a name? – JACK &amp; JONES - Renault Sport Formula One Team Official Partner|work=jackjonesracing.com|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaze’s plans changed as well. He took part in a number of non-championship F1 events, and then in June travelled to the [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps]] for the [[1952 Belgian Grand Prix|Grote Prijs van Belgie]]. After qualifying the HWM-Alta 16th, he raced one place better, attaining 15th place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr018.html|title=Grand Prix Results: Belgian GP, 1952|work=grandprix.com|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By racing in Spa, Gaze became the first Australian to contest a World Championship motor race.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/109081|title=Former grand prix driver Tony Gaze dies aged 93|first=Jamie|last=O'Leary|work=autosport.com|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by appearances in the [[1952 British Grand Prix|RAC British Grand Prix]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr020.html|title=Grand Prix Results: British GP, 1952|work=grandprix.com|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[1952 German Grand Prix|Groβer Preis von Deutschland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr021.html|title=Grand Prix Results: German GP, 1952|work=grandprix.com|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he failed to qualify for the [[1952 Italian Grand Prix|Gran Premio d’Italia]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr023.html|title=Grand Prix Results: Italian GP, 1952|work=grandprix.com|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, he was a member of the first Australian crew to attempt the [[Monte Carlo Rally|Rallye Monte Carlo]] in a [[Holden 48-215|Holden FX]] with [[Lex Davison]] and [[Stan Jones (racing driver)|Stan Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18378214|title=MONTE-CARLO RALLY - FORD ZEPHYR WINS on SHELL - The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954) - 1 Jul 1953|work=nla.gov.au|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlg.speedfreaks.org/archive/www2/miscral/53miscra.html|title=1953 Miscellaneous Rallies|first=Darren|last=Galpin|work=speedfreaks.org|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, the trio was in the top ten, but finished the event in 64th.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; Also that season, he raced an [[Aston Martin DB3]] in sports car events across Europe,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and survived an accident in the [[Portuguese Grand Prix|Grande Prémio de Portugal]], when his car struck a tree after a collision with a Ferrari. He was thrown clear as the Aston flipped over and burst into flames. Gaze was carried to safety by spectators, and suffered only cuts and bruises.&lt;ref name="cams.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cams.com.au/media/news/news-archives/2013/august/tony-gaze-eulogy-by-tim-schenken|title=Tony Gaze Memorial service|work=cams.com.au|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954 and 1955, Gaze raced the ex-[[Alberto Ascari|Ascari]] [[Ferrari Tipo 500|Ferrari 500 F2]] in non-championship events in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; On his return to England, he set up the Kangaroo Stable, the first Australian international racing team. One team member was a young [[Jack Brabham]]. They ran [[Aston Martin DB3S]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cams.com.au"/&gt; However, many races were cancelled after the [[1955 Le Mans disaster|Le Mans disaster]], and the Stable disbanded at the end of the season.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; Gaze continued to race for another season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/driver/results/Tony-Gaze-AUS.html|title=Tony Gaze (AUS) - All Results - Racing Sports Cars|work=racingsportscars.com|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18666">'''''Trump vs. Bernie''''' is a satirical comedy act created by [[Anthony Atamanuik]] and [[James Adomian]] that imagines a series of fictional presidential debates between [[Donald Trump]] and [[Bernie Sanders]] during the [[2016 Presidential Election]]. In a deliberately absurd anachronism, "Trump" (Atamnuik) and "Bernie" (Adomian) engage in inter-party debates long before their parties' nominations are decided. Originating in October 2015 as a live sketch at the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] (UCB) in New York, ''Trump vs. Bernie'' continued throughout the 2016 election season as a 40-city live comedy debate tour and spawned a special one-hour appearance on [[Comedy Central]]'s [[@midnight]], two hour-long specials produced for [[Fusion TV|Fusion]], and a comedy album released by [[Comedy Dynamics]], along with numerous appearances on news and comedy programs, radio shows, and podcasts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/21/trump-vs-bernie-round-2-debate-heads-for-new-york-comedy-festival/|title='Trump vs. Bernie,' Round 2: Debate Heads for New York Comedy Festival|last=Zinoman|first=Jason|work=ArtsBeat|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a54801/the-president-show-anthony-atamanuik-donald-trump-review/|title=Trump Impersonator Anthony Atamanuik Hopes to Make Satire Part of the Fourth Estate|date=2017-04-28|work=Esquire|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2016/12/midnight-host-chris-hardwick-comedy-central-talking-dead-trump-bernie-debate-1201865452/|title=‘@midnight’ Host Chris Hardwick On New Slot, Show’s Political Transformation, Post-Election Plans &amp; ‘Talking Dead’|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=2016-12-08|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2016/03/trump-vs-bernie-series-donald-trump-bernie-sanders-fusion-1201712660/|title=‘Trump Vs.

== @midnight guest appearance ==
On March 23, 2016, @midnight deviated from its usual three-person panel game format to host an hour-long ''Trump vs. Bernie'' debate moderated by host [[Chris Hardwick]]. According to Hardwick, a Comedy Central executive present at the taping decided to preempt originally scheduled programming to extend the 30 minute show to an hour because he was so impressed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Billed as "socialist vs. sociopath," the episode was subsequently posted to YouTube and has amassed over 7 million views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2016/03/trump-bernie-debate-midnight-chris-hardwick-1201725626/|title=‘Trump &amp; Bernie’ Debate On ‘@midnight’: Chris Hardwick Moderates "Socialist Vs.

== Reception ==
Both Atamanuik and Adomian have received praise for their portrayals. Critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[Jason Zinoman]] said of their initial debate, "The best sketch about the current political campaign that I've seen this year was not on '[[Saturday Night Live]].'"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dan Caffrey of [[The A.V. Club]] credits Atamanuik with taking a "psychological approach" with "moments of self-awareness" that allows him explore the emptiness of Trump's soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-president-show-gifts-donald-trump-with-frightening-1798191151|title=The President Show gifts Donald Trump with frightening moments of self-awareness|last=Caffrey|first=Dan|work=TV Club|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Salon and Huffington Post called Adomian's Sanders better than [[Larry David]]'s, which Jené Gutierrez of the Daily Dot attributed to his ability to not only capture the essence of Sanders, but to bolster it with improvisation that "communicates complex issues in an accessible way" and transforms it into "smart and subtly flattering comedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/2015/10/20/no_offense_larry_david_but_this_is_the_best_bernie_sanders_impression_in_the_game/|title=No offense, Larry David, but ''this'' is the best Bernie Sanders impression in the game|date=2015-10-20|work=Salon|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-impersonation_us_562435e7e4b0bce34701253b|title=Larry David Was Pretty, Pretty Good As Bernie Sanders, But This Comedian Is Even Better|last=Fang|first=Marina|date=2015-10-19|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/james-adomian-bernie-sanders-impression/|title=James Adomian and the art of the Bernie Sanders impression {{!}} The Daily Dot|date=2015-12-19|work=The Daily Dot|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comedian [[Patton Oswalt]] agreed saying, "[ James Adomian ] and [ Anthony Atamanuik ] are the scary best at everything.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/pattonoswalt/status/656524519566278656|title=Yep!

On a scale of 1-10, it's an 11! TREMENDOUS Trump. BRILLIANT Bernie."

== Aftermath ==
After the election of Donald Trump, Comedy Central premiered ''The President Show'' on April 27, 2017 as a weekly late-night show starring Atamanuik.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/03/arts/television/trump-talk-show-comedy-central-anthony-atamanuik-the-president-show.html|title=A Trump Talk Show, Courtesy of Comedy Central|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|date=2017-04-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adomian reprised his role as Bernie on an episode of the show as well as on its one-hour special "I Came Up With Christmas."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://splitsider.com/2017/05/donald-trump-catches-up-with-his-old-friend-bernie-sanders-on-the-president-show/|title=Donald Trump Catches Up with His Old Friend Bernie Sanders on ‘The President Show’|date=2017-05-19|work=Splitsider|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://splitsider.com/2017/12/watch-some-clips-from-the-president-shows-one-hour-special-i-came-up-with-christmas/|title=Watch Some Clips from ‘The President Show’s One-Hour Special ‘I Came Up with Christmas’|date=2017-12-01|work=Splitsider|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Virginia Pumpkin Festival''' is an annual event held since 2007 in the town of [[Virginia, County Cavan]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The festival takes place every [[bank holiday]] weekend at [[Halloween]] at the end of October.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
The festival began in 2007 with crowds of up to ten thousand. On the Friday night the whole town was suddenly pitch black, before being completely lit up by candle light from pumpkin lanterns which were placed throughout the town. The events continued on Saturday with a variety of activities for all ages which included pumpkin olympics, arts and crafts exhibitions and music from local band "[[RHETOFIRE]]".  Then followed the Pumpkin King and Queen competition when perfectly dressed Ladies and Gentlemen representing the public houses in the town were interviewed, Avril Soden and Martin Tynan were crowned as king and queen.  On the Sunday afternoon the main event of the festival took place, pumpkin weigh in followed by a parade. The winner of the first ever Virginia Pumpkin Competition was Ed Molloy from Co. Longford.This year, the Festival was launched by famous chef Richard Corrigan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://virginia.ie/index.php?page=about-the-festival] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819102103/http://virginia.ie/index.php?page=about-the-festival |date=August 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festival==
The Whirlygig Fire parade and was followed by a firework display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=D McWilliams |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/pumpkin-up-the-volume-halloween-festival-fun-1510790.html |title=Pumpkin up the volume Halloween festival fun - National News, Frontpage |publisher=Independent.ie |date=2008-10-27 |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Throughout the years the event has grown and grown just like the size of the pumpkins which enter the main competition of the weekend, Virginia town has welcomed growers from Ireland, Britain and Italy to attempt to win a cash prize  the pumpkins are judged on their, size and shape and colour. They also included a live weigh-in of Ireland's heaviest pumpkins. The events which took place last year (2007) happened again but to make it distinctive, the organisers produced other attraction for the weekend in 2008. Some of these were a fancy dress Halloween party, kids treasure hunt, and even cookery demonstrations.  They also added such events as the teddy bear picnic and with live performances from a wide range of acts, such as the music like [[Shane MacGowan]], [[Sharon Shannon]] and [[Mundy]] entertained crowds in the Pumpkin Marquee. There was also a street performance from the Whirligig theatre group who travelled from [[Co Donegal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/town-lights-up-for-pumpkin-fete-1510087.html By Senan Hogan Saturday October 25, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In  2009  [[Bell X1]] &lt;ref&gt;By Denise Clarke Monday October 26, 2009  http://www.independent.ie/national-news/thrills-and-spills-at-pumpkin-festival-1924393.html&lt;/ref&gt; performed over the weekend and there was also music from Country music singers Declan Nerney and Philomena Begley at the Farmers' Dance in the Pumpkin Marquee as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=independent.ie phone apps |url=http://www.independent.ie/travel/inside-ireland/10-scariest-halloween-thrillers-1923646.html |title=10 scariest Halloween thrillers - Inside Ireland, Travel |publisher=Independent.ie |date=2009-10-24 |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functioning as an open and dynamic platform, World Water Week aims to link practice, science, policy and decision-making.

During the week, the [[Stockholm Water Prize]], the [[Stockholm Junior Water Prize]], and the [[Stockholm Industry Water Award]] are given out at their respective award ceremonies.

== History ==

The World Water Week in Stockholm originally began as the Stockholm Water Symposium in 1991 and has been convened annually ever since. In 2001, the official name became World Water Week in Stockholm.  SIWI identifies a conference theme to place a specific focus on one aspect of the world's escalating water crisis. Initially, one theme was promoted for 4-5 years.  Since 2008, a different theme has been selected for each year.
