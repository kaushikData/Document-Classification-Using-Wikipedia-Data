* The ''[[Pau Grand Prix#History|Circuit du Sud-Ouest]]'' was run in Pau. Some [[English language|anglophone]] sources wrongly call it the 'Pau Grand Prix'.

The ''Grand Prix du Palais d’Hiver'' was the name of the prizes awarded for the lesser classes ('Light cars' and 'Voiturettes'). The ''Grand Prix de Pau'' was the name of the prize awarded for the 'Heavy' (fastest) class. Thus [[Maurice Farman]] was awarded the 'Grand Prix de Pau' for his overall victory in the ''Circuit du Sud-Ouest'' driving a [[Panhard|Panhard 24 hp]]. Additionally the ''Grand Prix du Palais d’Hiver'' (400 à 650&amp;nbsp;kg 'Light car' class) was awarded to [[Henri Farman]] ([[Darracq and Company London|Darracq]]); the second ''Grand Prix du Palais d’Hiver'' for the under 400&amp;nbsp;kg ''Voiturettes''class was awarded to [[Louis Renault (industrialist)|Louis Renault]] ([[Renault]]); the ''Prix du Béarn'' was awarded to Osmont in a '[[De Dion-Bouton|De Dion]]' tricycle.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7324">The '''anchor leg''' is the final position in a [[relay race]]. Typically, the anchor leg of a relay is given to the fastest or most experienced competitor on a team. The athlete completing the anchor leg of a relay is responsible for making up ground on the race-leader or preserving the lead already secured by their teammates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.runnersworld.com/running-tips/ask-coaches-relay-strategy Ask the Coaches: Relay Strategy].

==Famous anchor leg runners==

"Bullet" [[Bob Hayes]] ran anchor leg for the United States [[4×100 metres relay]] team in the [[1964 Tokyo Olympics]]. Receiving the baton in fifth place, Hayes pulled ahead of four runners to win the race. A French rival, [[Jocelyn Delecour]], remarked to the American lead-off runner [[Paul Drayton (athlete)|Paul Drayton]] "You haven't got anything except Hayes", and Drayton responded "That's all we need, pal".&lt;ref&gt;Litsky, Frank (2002-09-20). [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/20/sports/bob-hayes-stellar-sprinter-and-receiver-is-dead-at-59.html Bob Hayes, Stellar Sprinter and Receiver, Is Dead at 59 ]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved on 2014-05-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Lewis]] never lost a race when he anchored the American 4×100 m relay team. He regularly ran under 9 seconds for his anchor legs and helped the team break the [[Men's 4 × 100 metres relay world record progression|world record in the 4×100 m relay]] five times.  The record set by the U.S. at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of 37.40 seconds stood for 16 years.

Anchoring the U.S. sprint relay team at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], [[Evelyn Ashford]] ran a reported 9.77 seconds, the fastest time ever for a woman over 100 metres. The U.S. team of [[Alice Brown (athlete)|Alice Brown]] (first leg), [[Jeanette Bolden]] (second leg) and [[Chandra Cheeseborough]] (third leg) won by the biggest margin in the event's history.

[[Usain Bolt]] anchored the 2012 Jamaican 4x100 metres relay and helped set a new world record with a time 36.84 seconds.

In some cases, athletes who are not top performers in individual events excel when given the responsibility of anchoring a relay. [[Phil Brown (athlete)|Phil Brown]], a U.K. [[400 metres|400 m]] runner, won Olympic, World and European championship medals as the anchor leg runner for his national [[4 x 400 metres relay|4 x 400 m relay]] team despite never having won a medal and rarely having advanced beyond the preliminary rounds individually, while British hurdling specialist [[Kriss Akabusi]] swapped places with normal Great Britain anchor, Olympic 400 metre silver medalist [[Roger Black]] in a race where he famously caught, held and then passed 400 metre world champion [[Antonio Pettigrew]] to win Great Britain the [[2007 World Championships in Athletics|World Championship gold in Tokyo]], the United States' only championship loss at the distance in a  12 year span. Due to the final legs of 4 x 400 metre relay being run without lanes, the anchor may need to display some of the talents normally associated with a middle distance runner, including tactical awareness, overtaking technique  and physical strength to hold off other athletes, as well as basic speed.

After she placed 8th individually in the [[100 metres|100 m]], [[Pam Marshall]] ran the anchor leg for the American 4 x 100 m team at the [[1987 World Athletics Championships]] in Rome and beat [[Marlies Göhr]] in the final with an anchor leg timed at 10.11 s to Gohr's 10.41 s.

== Famous anchor leg swimmers==

At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, [[Jason Lezak]] was the oldest male on the U.S. swim team. He anchored the U.S. 4×100 m freestyle relay team that won the gold medal and set a new world record.

At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, [[Michael Phelps]] swam the anchor leg of the 4 x 200 m relay becoming the most decorated Olympian of all time with his 19th career medal (15th gold medal).  He returned in 2016 to again anchor the [[Swimming at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Men's 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay|4x200]], claiming his 21st gold and 25th medal.

'''BankGiroLoterij''' was the name of a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] professional [[road bicycle racing]] team.  The main sponsor from 2000 to 2004 was a Dutch lottery operator [[:nl:BankGiro Loterij|BankGiro Loterij]] {{nl icon}}.  No sponsor was available for 2005, so the team disbanded.  At that time, they were placed 29th in Division 1 in the [[UCI Road World Rankings]]. A significant number of the team riders joined Team [[Team Giant-Alpecin|Shimano-Memory Corp]], after its merge with [[Japan]]ese team [[Shimano]].

'''Bartram''' (first name and dates unknown) was an English [[cricket]]er who played in [[first-class cricket|first-class]] matches for [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] during the 1740s. He is recorded in cricket's second-oldest surviving scorecard playing for Kent against an [[All-England Eleven]] at the [[Artillery Ground]] on Monday, 18 June 1744. He scored two [[run (cricket)|runs]] and held one catch. Kent won by 1 wicket.&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Bartram had established his reputation by 1744, he must have been active for some years previously and his career probably began in the 1730s. Very few players were mentioned by name in contemporary reports and there are no other references to Bartram.

'''Coca-Cola Coliseum''' is an arena at [[Exhibition Place]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, used for agricultural displays, [[ice hockey]] and trade shows. It was built for the [[Canadian National Exhibition]] (CNE) and the [[Royal Agricultural Winter Fair]] (the Royal) in 1921. It was formerly known as the '''Ricoh Coliseum''', and since 1997 it has been part of the "National Trade Centre" exhibition complex. It serves as the home arena of the [[Toronto Marlies]] ice hockey team, the [[American Hockey League]] farm team of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]. For the [[2015 Pan American Games]] the venue hosted the [[Gymnastics at the 2015 Pan American Games|gymnastics competitions]] and was known as the '''Toronto Coliseum'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gilbert |first=Erika |date=July 15, 2015 |title=Guide to the 2015 Pan Am Games: Everything you need to know about artistic gymnastics |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/sports/guide-to-the-2015-pan-am-games-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artistic-gymnastics |newspaper=[[National Post]] |location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada |access-date=August 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On January 1, 1920, Toronto voters approved by plebiscite&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto World |date=January 2, 1920 |title=Total Vote Polled For Mayor, Controllers And Bylaws |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; a proposal by the Royal Agricultural Fair Association to construct, at a maximum cost of {{CAD|1|link=yes}} million, a new arena for livestock. The [[Municipal government of Toronto|City of Toronto]] (City) made a call for tenders in the fall of 1920 but the lowest tender was {{CAD|1.9}} million, exceeding the mandate approved by plebiscite. The size of the planned building was reduced by half in an attempt to get the cost under {{CAD|1}} million and a new call for tenders was done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Globe |date=April 15, 1921 |title=Change In Size of Fair Arena |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest tender received was from Anglin-Norcross Ltd. of Montreal for {{CAD|892,000}} to build the building to City Architect F. W. Price's specifications. There was reticence to hire a Montreal firm, and the city held off on awarding the contract while Price sought out construction offers from local firms to do the work using day labour, although the legality of this was questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |date=May 6, 1921 |page=1 |title=City Architect Is Told To Build Live Stock Arena}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue raised was that the revised arena design needed to be expanded to meet the fair's needs. Anglin-Norcross offered to do the work at a further {{CAD|31,000}}. It took two City Council votes, but Council finally approved the awarding of the contract to Anglin-Norcross on May 26, 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |date=May 27, 1921 |title=Arena Contracts Are Debated by City Council |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demolition of existing buildings on the site commenced a few days later and arena work commenced in June 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=Pay Cut-Rate Wages On Arena Contracts? |date=June 29, 1921 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cornerstone was laid by Toronto Mayor [[Thomas Langton Church|Thomas Church]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Toronto Public Library |url=http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?R=DC-PICTURES-R-4119 |title=C.N.E.; Coliseum, laying of cornerstone by T. L. Church. Toronto, Ont.|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on July 27, 1921 and Robert Fleming, President of the [[Canadian National Exhibition]] (CNE) declared that the building would be the largest of its kind in the world,&lt;ref name="globe-1921-07-28"&gt;{{cite web |work=The Globe |date=July 28, 1921 |title=Mayor Well And Truly Lays Corner-Stone Of New Arena |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a floor space of {{Convert|8.5|acre|ha}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |date=July 27, 1921 |title=New Live Stock Arena Assuming Shape |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Exhibition Coliseum under construction 1921.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of the arena in October 1921. The building was later opened in December 1921.]]
The Fair Association had hoped for the arena to be open by the fall of 1921 to inaugurate the new fair, but it was not ready. The {{CAD|1}} million building had its official public opening on December 16, 1921, attended by 5,000 persons to see an athletic meet put on by the "Sportsmen Patriotic Association."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |date=December 17, 1921 |page=3 |title=5,000 People Attend Opening of New Arena}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon completion, the building was billed as the largest of its kind in North America.&lt;ref name="explace-wt"&gt;{{cite web |title=Walking Tours |url=http://www.explace.on.ca/history/walking_tours.php |publisher=Exhibition Place |accessdate=October 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906122050/http://www.explace.on.ca/history/walking_tours.php |archivedate=September 6, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Coliseum" was given to the building in 1922, in time for the opening of the CNE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Globe |title=Council To Consider Rental of Coliseum |date=July 8, 1922 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main entrance was to the north, along Manitoba Drive. The southern side of the building was along the main TTC streetcar rail lines serving the CNE, which separated the Coliseum and Industry Buildings to the north, and the later Engineering and Electrical Building (1928) to the south. In 1926, additions were built and the complex was claimed to be the largest structure of its kind under one roof in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openplaques.org/places/ca/areas/toronto_on/plaques?id=unphotographed |publisher=openplaques.org |title=Open Plaques: Toronto, ON, Canada: Unphotographed |accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, the [[Horse Palace]] was built next door to provide a permanent building for the stables of the Winter Fair.&lt;ref name="star-1931-08-14"&gt;{{cite web |work=Toronto Star |title=New Million-Dollar Exhibition Stables Completed Tomorrow |page=24 |date=August 14, 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Horse Judging in Coliseum, 1940.jpg|thumb|Horses are judged at the Coliseum in 1940. The building hosted a number of equestrian events since its completion.]]
From 1942 to 1945, the building was used as a training base for the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] during [[World War II]] and known as the 'Manning Depot'.&lt;ref name="explace-wt"/&gt; A photo of it as the RCAF Manning Depot is in the New Westminster Museum and Archives # IHP9562-003. After the war, it mainly hosted equestrian events for the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair, the CNE and other events. The arena was also used as a horse barn.

In time for the 1963 CNE, the southern facade was reconstructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=World's Biggest, The CNE Just Another Month Away |date=July 17, 1963 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the renovation, the southern facade was reclad with black, grey and white siding and a new front plaza was built, with a large "COLISEUM" sign on top. The CNE spent {{CAD|3}} million from 1960 until 1963 on "face-lifting" the Coliseum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Globe and Mail |date=August 23, 1963 |title=How Much Has The CNE Changed? |page=7 |first=Betty |last=Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the National Trade Centre (now the [[Enercare Centre]]) exhibition complex was built. The new project removed the 1963 entrance and cladding, restoring the original facade, although the cupola towers on the southern facade had been removed in the 1963 renovation. Access to the Coliseum was moved to the western entrance of the exhibition complex through a hall known as Heritage Court.&lt;ref name="ch040597"&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Hume |date=April 5, 1997 |title=Vast trade centre shows two faces |work=Toronto Star |page=M7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2002, the City of Toronto agreed to an extensive renovation of the Coliseum to attract a professional [[ice hockey]] team to the arena.&lt;ref name=onice&gt;{{cite news |title=AHL Team Back on Ice|first=Ken|last=Campbell|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=November 29, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At a cost of {{CAD|38}} million, the arena's capacity was expanded from 6,500 to 9,700 by building a new higher roof, lowering the floor, adding new seats in the expanded area&lt;ref name=makeover/&gt;&lt;ref name=BW/&gt;  and the installation of 38 private suites.&lt;ref name=makeover/&gt;  [[OMERS#Borealis Infrastructure|Borealis Infrastructure]] contributed {{CAD|9}} million up front and {{CAD|20}} million of borrowed funds in return for a 49-year lease to the arena.&lt;ref name=skeptics/&gt;&lt;ref name=exbord&gt;{{cite web|title=Expansion of MLSEL Office Space in Ricoh Coliseum |url=http://www.explace.on.ca/database/rte/files/Item%2017-MLSEL.pdf|publisher=[[Exhibition Place]]|date=June 26, 2013 |accessdate=January 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103154508/http://www.explace.on.ca/database/rte/files/Item%2017-MLSEL.pdf |archivedate=January 3, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The City of Toronto invested {{CAD|9}} million in the project and guaranteed Borealis' loans, while remaining the owner of the building.&lt;ref name=makeover&gt;{{cite news |title=Coliseum Gets Makeover |first=James|last=Christie |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/coliseum-gets-makeover/article1009714/ |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=January 16, 2003 |accessdate=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=skeptics/&gt;&lt;ref name=onice/&gt;&lt;ref name=exbord/&gt;

In 2003, [[Japan]]ese office supply company [[Ricoh]] purchased the naming rights to the new facility for {{CAD|10}} million over ten years, with an optional five-year extension.&lt;ref name=makeover/&gt;&lt;ref name=BW&gt;{{cite press release |title=Ricoh Canada Inc.

In 2018, MLSE announced that the [[Toronto Argonauts]] football operations offices and weight rooms would be relocated to Ricoh Coliseum in late June of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tsn.ca/argonauts-to-relocate-football-operations-staff-1.1100509|title=Argonauts to relocate football-operations staff  - Article - TSN|date=2018-05-31|work=TSN|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 11, 2018, at the end of Ricoh's partnership with the building, [[Coca-Cola]] purchased the naming rights to the facility for 10 years, re-naming it "Coca-Cola Coliseum".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/new-coca-cola-and-mlse-partnership-expands-commitment-to-the-community-through-coca-cola-coliseum-687890611.html|title=New Coca-Cola and MLSE Partnership Expands Commitment to the Community Through Coca-Cola Coliseum  - Article - CISION|date=2018-07-11|work=CISION|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Since November 1922, the Coliseum has been used by the [[Royal Agricultural Winter Fair]] held in November annually except during the years of [[World War II]]. The Fair uses the arena for the annual "Royal Horse Show" equestrian competition, as well as animal presentations.
[[File:Toronto Royal Horse Show.jpg|thumb|The Royal Horse Show during the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair, an event hosted by the Coliseum.]]
Each year in August, the Coliseum is used by the CNE for exhibits and performances. It has in the past used for CNE cat, dog and horse shows. Until 2013, the CNE held the CNE Horse Show, a competitive event in the Coliseum. At one time run during the Ex, it changed to be a pre-CNE event in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Inside Toronto |url=http://www.insidetoronto.com/news-story/4192958-cne-cancels-horse-show-competition/ |title=CNE cancels Horse Show competition |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used by the [[Musical Ride|Royal Canadian Mounted Police Musical Ride]]. During the 2009, 2010 and 2011 CNE, it was used for a figure skating show.

The arena is also used for trade shows. The annual Boat Show builds an indoor pond over the arena floor.

===Ice hockey===
As early as the 1970s, plans were floated to outfit CNE Coliseum for [[ice hockey]]. When the [[World Hockey Association]]'s [[Ottawa Nationals]] moved to Toronto as the [[Toronto Toros]], they initially wanted to play at a renovated CNE Coliseum. However, due to objections from Maple Leafs vice president [[Bill Ballard]], the Toros played at [[Varsity Arena]] before briefly becoming tenants of the Leafs at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]].
[[File:Calder Cup Final - (06.14.18)-37 (41216027430).jpg|thumb|[[2018 Calder Cup playoffs|2018 Calder Cup Final]] between the [[Texas Stars]] and the [[Toronto Marlies]]. The arena was outfitted for ice hockey in the early 21st century.]]
In the early 2000s, there were efforts to bring a minor professional hockey team to the Coliseum.  Plans to move the dormant [[Phoenix Roadrunners (IHL)|Phoenix Roadrunners]] of the [[International Hockey League (1945–2001)|International Hockey League]] to Toronto for the 2002-2003 season fell apart when the league dissolved and six teams, but not the Roadrunners, were absorbed by the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) in the summer of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Roadrunners' Future in the IHL Looks Pretty Grim ; Team's Hopes of Survival Seem to Be on Life Support|first=Ken|last=Campbell|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=June 1, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=skeptics&gt;{{cite news |title=Deal with the City Had Its Skeptics|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=November 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same group then attempted to purchase the [[Louisville Panthers]] AHL franchise, which had suspended operations for the 2001-2002 season, and relocate it to the Coliseum, but the AHL voted against the transaction in December 2001.&lt;ref name=bulldogscentre&gt;{{cite news |title=Bulldogs at Centre of Louisville Relocation|first=Garry|last=Mckay|newspaper=[[The Hamilton Spectator]]|date=July 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=close&gt;{{cite news |title=Deal to Bring AHL to the CNE 'Close' ; Hamilton's Bulldogs Could Become the Toronto Roadrunners|first=Ken|last=Peters|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=April 3, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unleased/&gt;  The [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] pressured the [[Hamilton Bulldogs (AHL)|Hamilton Bulldogs]], who held territorial rights to Toronto since it fell within their 50-mile home territory, to veto the transaction.&lt;ref name=bulldogscentre/&gt;  The Leafs reportedly did not want the Coliseum to be upgraded as it would compete with their newly opened [[Air Canada Centre]].&lt;ref name=skeptics/&gt;  Next, the group began pursuing the Bulldogs, which were owned by their NHL affiliate the [[Edmonton Oilers]].&lt;ref name=close/&gt;&lt;ref name=unleased/&gt;&lt;ref name=eyeing/&gt;  The Bulldogs did not require league approval to move to Toronto since the Coliseum was within their territory.&lt;ref name=skeptics/&gt;&lt;ref name=unleased&gt;{{cite news |title=Hamilton Bulldogs Unleashed to Become Toronto Roadrunners: New Deal Will Save Oilers Several Million Dollars|first=Joanne|last=Ireland|newspaper=[[Edmonton Journal]]|date=April 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eyeing&gt;{{cite news |title=AHL Bulldogs Eyeing Move to Toronto|newspaper=[[Guelph Mercury]]|date=April 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Roadrunners Aim to Score at Box Office: Toronto's New Hockey Team Vows to Make Money|first=Robert|last=Thompson|newspaper=[[National Post]]|date=October 25, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; An agreement was reached with the Oilers to relocate the Bulldogs to Toronto, and to rename them the [[Toronto Roadrunners]].  Borealis signed a 49-year sublease to the building with the Roadrunners for $9,500 per game.&lt;ref name=skeptics/&gt;&lt;ref name=exbord/&gt;

On November 1, 2003, the Coliseum made its debut as an ice hockey venue, as the Roadrunners tied the [[Rochester Americans]] 1-1.  However, the Roadrunners' lease was terminated in June 2004, following their first season, for defaulting on its rent.&lt;ref name=exbord/&gt;&lt;ref name=default&gt;{{cite news |title=Oilers' Farm Team Caught in Lease Controversy at Ricoh|first=Steve|last=Erwin|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/oilers-farm-team-caught-in-lease-controversy-at-ricoh/article1000820/|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=June 16, 2004|accessdate=January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Oilers chose to [[Edmonton Road Runners|relocate]] the Roadrunners to [[Edmonton]] for the following season due to poor attendance and in anticipation of the impending [[2004–05 NHL lockout|NHL lockout]].

The Coliseum was left without a hockey tenant for a year, but in August 2004 [[Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment]] announced that they would relocate their [[St. John's Maple Leafs|AHL farm team]] from [[St. John's, Newfoundland]] to Toronto to play in the Coliseum for the 2005-2006 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leafs Making Final Run in St. John's|url=http://theahl.com/leafs-making-final-run-in-st-john-s-p137005|publisher=[[American Hockey League]]|date=November 29, 2004|accessdate=January 3, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103163121/http://theahl.com/leafs-making-final-run-in-st-john-s-p137005|archivedate=January 3, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; after agreeing on a 20-year lease for the arena.&lt;ref name=exbord/&gt; Their lease calls for rent to cover debt financing charges, property taxes and generate a return to the arena investors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Comprehensive Review of City's Loan Guarantee and Loan Portfolio|url=http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2013/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-57447.pdf|publisher=City of Toronto|date=April 9, 2013|accessdate=January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which exceeds $4 million annually.&lt;ref name=dreamjob&gt;{{cite book |title=Dream Job|last=Peddie|first=Richard|year=2013|publisher=[[Harper Collins]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team, which was subsequently renamed the [[Toronto Marlies]], debuted in their new home on October 12, 2005 with a 5-2 victory over the [[Syracuse Crunch]], in front of a crowd of 8,056. The Coliseum hosted the 2007 [[American Hockey League|AHL]] All-Star Game on January 29, 2007.

===Other sports===
[[File:Vault 4 2015 Pan Am Games.jpg|thumb|The Coliseum hosted the [[Gymnastics at the 2015 Pan American Games|gymnastics competition]] for the [[2015 Pan American Games]].]]
On April 4, 1922, it was the site of the [[Johnny Dundee]] vs Jimmy Goodrich boxing match promoted by Jack Corcoran that set a new indoor sports attendance record for Toronto with 11,900 spectators packed into the building. The mark would stand until the construction of [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in 1931. The Coliseum hosted the [[Lingerie Football League|Lingerie Football League's]] [[Toronto Triumph]] in their lone season in operation in 2012. From July 11–20, 2015, the Coliseum hosted the [[Gymnastics at the 2015 Pan American Games|gymnastics competition]] of the [[2015 Pan American Games]], during which it was known as the "Toronto Coliseum." The Coliseum hosted the Longines World Cup Jumping (Equestrian) Championships in November 2015. The Coliseum hosted the Canada-Netherlands [[Davis Cup]] tie September 14-16, 2018, which featured [[Daniel Nestor]]’s final competitive match.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10364">Professionals and amateurs alike wear protective head gear (helmets) to reduce the chance of injury while playing [[American football]]. The [[football helmet]] has changed over time and many different materials have become available. The rules of the game have changed as well.

==Origins==
[[File:Behind interference remington 1893.jpg|thumbnail|In the early days of American football, players did not wear helmets.]]
In 1888 the [[college football]] rules convention voted to allow tackling below the waist. Players and coaches soon regarded pads as essential for the game. However, as in the [[National Hockey League]] during the 1970s, helmets were the last thing to be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, D.J.; [http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1043&amp;context=comssp&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com.au%2Fscholar%3Fq%3Dinvention%2B%2522football%2Bhelmet%2522%26btnG%3D%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D1%252C5%26as_vis%3D1#search=%22invention%20football%20helmet%22 Ideological Criticism Of The National Football League's Increase In Helmet To Helmet Discipline]&lt;/ref&gt; They were not a mandatory piece of equipment in college gridiron until 1939&lt;ref name="nelson"&gt;Nelson, David M.; ''The Anatomy of a Game: Football, the Rules, and the Men Who Made the Game''; p. 76. {{ISBN|0874134552}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were not made mandatory in the National Football League until [[1943 NFL season|1943]]&lt;ref name="official"&gt;Beau Riffenburgh, ''The Official NFL Encyclopedia'': "The Helmet"&lt;/ref&gt; As a side note, "the last NFL player to play in a game without a helmet was [[Dick Plasman]] an [[end (American football)|end]] for the [[Chicago Bears]] in 1940."&lt;ref name="official"/&gt; There is a photograph of him without one taken during the [[1940 NFL Championship Game]] in which Chicago defeated [[1940 Washington Redskins season|the Washington Redskins]] 73–0.

Before the invention of the football helmet, players would often grow their hair long, because they believed it would protect their heads. &lt;ref&gt;[http://fourwallspublishing.com/BlogMChaney/?p=629 The 1890s: Brain Risks Confirmed in American Football]&lt;/ref&gt;
The man largely credited with inventing the first helmet was [[George Barclay (baseball)|George Barclay]].&lt;ref name="nelson"/&gt; In 1896 he designed a headgear which soon became known as a "head harness". It had three thick leather straps forming a close fit around his head, made by a harness maker. Additionally, other sources credit the invention of the football helmet to [[Navy Midshipmen football|U.S. Naval Academy Midshipman]] [[Joseph M. Reeves]] (later to become the "Father of Carrier Aviation"), who had a protective device for his head made out of mole skin to allow him to play in the 1893 [[Army-Navy Game]] after he was told by a Navy doctor that he must give up football or risk death from another kick in the head. Reeves went to a local shoemaker/blacksmith and had a crude leather helmet fabricated to protect his skull.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militarymuseum.org/Reeves.html Californians and the Military: Admiral Joseph Mason "Bull" Reeves, USN (1872-1948)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021110425/http://www.militarymuseum.org/Reeves.html |date=2009-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the first helmet, Edgar Allan Poe III (grandnephew of [[Edgar Allan Poe|the famous writer]]) developed a small leather nose protector which, however, was found to severely interfere with vision and breathing and to come off easily&lt;ref&gt;"Equipment; in "Rielly, Edward J.; ''Football: An Encyclopedia of Popular Culture''; p. 106. {{ISBN|0803290128}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1909_Michigan-Minnesota.png|thumbnail|In the early 20th century, some players wore helmets but they were not mandatory.]]
Later helmets were made of padded leather, and resembled aviators' helmets. The helmet slowly began to take more of the appearance we recognize today when around 1915 more padding and flaps were added with ear holes for better on-field communication. Painted helmets have been around almost as long as helmets themselves: used to show team spirit and to help the quarterback distinguish a down field receiver from the defenders. The helmets of the [[Michigan Wolverines football|University of Michigan Wolverines]] bear logos that follow the original seams of the leather helmets. Professional team logos started in 1948 when [[Fred Gehrke]], a [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] for [[1948 Los Angeles Rams season|the Los Angeles Rams]], began painting a horn design on all of the Rams' helmets. Gehrke studied art at the [[University of Utah]].

The next innovation came probably in 1917 in the form of suspension: to "cradle" the skull away from the foam shell. Straps of fabric formed a pattern inside the helmet. They absorbed and distributed the impact better, and they allowed for ventilation. It was a breakthrough. They were first known as "ZH" or Zuppke helmets named after the [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]] [[Robert Zuppke|coach who came up with the design]]. [[Rawlings (company)|Rawlings]] and [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] were some of the first manufacturers.

The first person to design a bar face mask on a football helmet was Vern McMillan, the owner of a sporting goods store in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]]. It was a rubber-covered wire mask on a leather helmet. This kind was used in the mid-1930s.

==Plastic helmets==
The plastic football helmet came in 1940. It was invented and patented by John T. Riddell and his son John T. Riddell Jr., of the John T. [[Riddell Sports Group, Inc.|Riddell]] Company in Chicago, a sporting goods provider. The single molded shell was stronger, lighter, longer-lasting, and did not rot the way leather does when damp. Colors could also be baked into the plastic so the paint jobs would be longer-lasting. In 1940 Riddell also developed the first chin strap to rest on the chin instead of the neck &lt;!-- the chin strap had been resting on the adams apple, many thought this caused kneck injuries --&gt; and the first plastic face mask.

There were problems however. The plastic helmets were brittle when hit head on. And the bar hole that was drilled for the face mask tended to pop loose. Because of this Riddell was in trouble and so was the plastic helmet. Riddell's plastic helmet was a little flat on top at first but it changed to its tear-drop shape, which allowed a blow to slide to one side or the other rather than be met head-on. Its web suspension could be raised or lowered to fit the head of a player. 

In 1955, G.E. Morgan, a consultant to Riddell, and [[Paul Brown]], the coach of the [[Cleveland Browns]], invented the BT-5 face mask which is the single bar design. The year after the BT-5 a single wave radio was installed in a players helmet so the coach could give the play to the quarterback over a radio frequency. It only resulted in game time interference but the experiment was ahead of its time.

In 1971, Morgan, now chairman of the board of Riddell received a patent for "Energy Absorbing and Sizing Means for Helmets." The result: new HA-91 and HA-92 energy-absorbing, "microfit" helmets. They had valves on their crown to allow air to be pumped into vinyl cushions that were crammed into every space inside the helmet. The player put it on and then had it pumped up to fit firmly around the player's head. Sometimes fluid was also used. An anti-freeze solvent, was used by some of the [[Green Bay Packers]] to beat the cold of [[Lambeau field]].  

Sources are unsure as to who first designed air bladders for football helmets but Dr. Richard Schneider of the [[University of Michigan]] Hospital is reported to have believed that air was the most effective way to protect against blunt force. With this theory in mind, he invented an inflatable bladder for use inside a football helmet. The Michigan Wolverines Football team used a prototype and [[Schutt Sports]] hired Schnieder and started mass-producing the AirTm Helmet in the early 1970s.

Many veteran players still preferred the old web suspended Riddell TK-2 because it was generally lighter and more breathable. Interior helmet pads were then developed that were lighter and did not need to be filled with air or fluid by both the Schutt and Riddell sports companies. And because of safety they were soon preferred by all positions {{source needed|date=June 2018}}.  

In late 1976, because of concern for safety, four point chin straps were required in college ball. These kept the helmet firmly in place. 

Space age rigid [[Polycarbonate]] alloy plastic helmets and vinyl coated steel alloy face masks were the norm in the 1980s and 1990s.

In 2002 Riddell released a new more spherical design for the helmet called the Revolution (or Revo) and it is currently the most widely used helmet in the [[National Football League]] The Schutt counterpart is called the DNA Pro Adult Helmet. A study released by the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] shows that the Riddell Revolution, and others like it, reduce the incidences of concussion by 31%.&lt;ref&gt;University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Jan. 14, 2006, Science Daily Magazine: Newer Football Helmet Design May Reduce Incidence Of Concussions In High School Players, Shows University Of Pittsburgh Study.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a Senate Commerce Committee meeting on October 19, 2011, heard testimony from Jeffrey Kutcher, an associate professor of neurology at the University of Michigan and chair of the American Academy of Neurology's sports neurology section that "there is no significant data" in the UPMC study for Riddell to make the claim that the helmet reduced concussions by 31%.  On or about May 2013, Mary K. Engle, the FTC's associate director for advertising practices wrote that the agency had concluded the UPMC study "did not prove that Revolution varsity football helmets reduce concussions or the risk of concussions by 35%".  Riddell has since discontinued use of the 31% claim.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fainaru-Wada|first=Mark|title=League of Denial|year=2013|publisher=Crown Archetype|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7704-3754-1|pages=317-318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Riddell released the Revolution Speed helmet.

'''Kim Un-yong''' or '''Un Yong Kim''' (19 March 1931 – 3 October 2017) was a [[South Korea|South Korean]] sports administrator, Vice-President of the [[International Olympic Committee]], and founding member of the [[World Taekwondo Federation|WTF]] executive board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3771931.stm |title=IOC official jailed for corruption |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2014-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3293927.stm |title=S Korea Taekwondo chief held |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2014-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim Un-yong was elected the president of the Korean Taekwondo Association on 23 January 1971.&lt;ref name=KA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Bd_NrWVI1q0C&amp;pg=PT214&amp;lpg=PT214&amp;dq=kim+un-yong+world+taekwondo+federation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_cOrxUwVE2&amp;sig=9lcQZZsZxdayJNA4NPGmBn2qtfQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-SyWVMbNK8fgavGRgeAK&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=kim%20un-yong%20world%20taekwondo%20federation&amp;f=false|title=A Killing Art|website=Books.google.co.uk|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received a doctorate in Political Science in 1963 from the [[Yonsei University]]. Kim retired from the WTF presidency in 2004 and was succeeded by Chungwon Choue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/140188/kim-un-yong-resigns-from-top-ioc-post |title= Kim Un-yong resigns from top IOC post|publisher=[[Dawn]] |date= |accessdate=2014-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim Un-yong was elected the president of the [[Korean Taekwondo Association]] on 23 January 1971. Though he initially declined the position due to the continued conflicts within the organization, he was asked by the Korean government to accept and to clean up the association.

Believing that Taekwondo was a Korean martial art and its governing body should therefore be based in Korea, Dr. Kim dissolved the relationship between the Korean Taekwondo Association and the [[International Taekwondo Federation]].

In 1973, the World Taekwondo Federation was formed and Dr. Kim was elected its first president.&lt;ref name=mamw&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CayyJJg0KIsC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;dq=kim+un-yong+taekwondo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KX3Q63xq9b&amp;sig=U_gSfdoSEvC-OjnEFDzdc98yYYQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hCyWVI6OLoTkat_DgegP&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=kim%20un-yong%20taekwondo&amp;f=false|title=Martial Arts in the Modern World|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=M01&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ns4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT73&amp;lpg=PT73&amp;dq=kim+un-yong+taekwondo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ndfo8vUVIJ&amp;sig=U9aiSHl19gUb6Naad9wakY3fr_0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XSyWVPu9OsL5ao_igmg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=kim%20un-yong%20taekwondo&amp;f=false|title=Black Belt March 2001|website=Books.google.co.uk|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=S76/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6toDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=kim+un-yong+taekwondo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X77cSBrzqa&amp;sig=KTq2-YUwFmuQrWJ0UhFiY4XKbC0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4CuWVMWxDc7easOYgbgO&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCTg8#v=onepage&amp;q=kim%20un-yong%20taekwondo&amp;f=false|title=Black Belt October 1988|website=Books.google.co.uk|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FaTfuuIlmqcC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=kim+un-yong+taekwondo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8yNMWUxc1y&amp;sig=6hLhBbdfUN_OmpJgquq4hC1WO84&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7CuWVJ_2F8Lwauz0goAD&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgy#v=onepage&amp;q=kim%20un-yong%20taekwondo&amp;f=false|title=Martial Arts of the World|website=Books.google.co.uk|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kook Hae-seong''' ({{korean|국해성|鞠海成}}; born 8 December 1989) is a South Korean professional baseball [[outfielder]] who is currently playing for the [[Doosan Bears]] of [[Korea Baseball Organization]]. His major position is [[right fielder]] and [[left fielder]], but he sometimes plays as [[center fielder]] or [[first baseman]]. He graduated from {{ill|Incheon High School|ko|인천고등학교}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.koreabaseball.com/Record/Player/HitterDetail/Basic.aspx?playerId=79290|title=KBO 홈페이지 player infro|last=스포츠투아이|first=|date=|website=|language=ko|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon graduation from high school, he made himself eligible for the 2008 KBO First-Year Player Draft, but went undrafted. Instead, Kook signed a contract with the [[Chicago Cubs]] in 2007. However, after the problem of elbow was found and the contract was broken, he was signed by the Doosan Bears as an undrafted free agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spotvnews.co.kr/?mod=news&amp;act=articleView&amp;idxno=47708|title='마의 LF' 숙제 얻은 박헌도-국해성|last=|first=|date=2016-03-15|work=SPOTVNEWS|access-date=30 April 2018|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="107956">The following is a description of the various and alternating rules of [[gridiron football]]. Numerous leagues or organizations tend to send a laundry list of rules in order to better distinguish themselves from their counterparts.

==American football (general)==
{{main|American football rules}}

===Field and players===
American football is played on a field {{convert|360|by|160|ft|1}}.&lt;ref name="Dimensions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsknowhow.com/football/field-dimensions/nfl-football-field-dimensions.html|title=NFL Football Field Dimensions|year=2004|publisher=SportsKnowHow.com|accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longer boundary lines are ''sidelines'', while the shorter boundary lines are ''end lines''. Sidelines and end lines are out of bounds. Near each end of the field is a ''goal line''; they are {{convert|100|yd|sigfig=3}} apart. A scoring area called an ''[[end zone]]'' extends {{convert|10|yd|sigfig=2}} beyond each goal line to each end line. The end zone includes the goal line but not the end line.&lt;ref name="Dimensions" /&gt; While the playing field is effectively flat, it is common for a field to be built with a slight crown—with the middle of the field higher than the sides—to allow water to drain from the field.

''Yard lines'' cross the field every {{convert|5|yd}}, and are numbered every 10 yards from each goal line to the 50-yard line, or midfield (similar to a typical [[rugby league]] field). Two rows of short lines, known as inbounds lines or ''hash marks'', run at 1-yard (91.4&amp;nbsp;cm) intervals perpendicular to the sidelines near the middle of the field. All plays start with the ball on or between the hash marks. Because of the arrangement of the lines, the field is occasionally referred to as a gridiron.

At the back of each end zone are two ''[[goalpost]]s'' (also called ''uprights'') connected by a crossbar {{convert|10|ft|m|sigfig=3}} from the ground. For high skill levels, the posts are {{convert|222|in|m|sigfig=3}} apart. For lower skill levels, these are widened to {{convert|280|in|m|sigfig=3}}.

Each team has 11 players on the field at a time. However, teams may substitute for any or all of their players, if time allows, during the break between plays. As a result, players have very specialized roles, and, sometimes (although rarely) almost all of the (at least) 46 active players on an NFL team will play in any given game. Thus, teams are divided into three separate units: the [[offensive team|offense]], the [[defensive team|defense]] and the [[special teams]].

===Start of halves===
Similarly to [[association football]], the game begins with a [[Coin flipping|coin toss]] to determine which team will kick off to begin the game and which goal each team will defend.&lt;ref name="Toss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/cointoss|title=Coin Toss|year=2009|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC|accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The options are presented again to start the second half; the choices for the first half do not automatically determine the start of the second half (i.e. it is possible for the same team to kick off both halves).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/cointoss|title=Coin Toss|year=2009|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC|accessdate=2015-01-18}}  But, this ordinarily does not happen.  Normally, the two halves are ''not'' both kicked off by the same team.&lt;/ref&gt; The referee conducts the coin toss with the captains (or sometimes coaches) of the opposing teams. The team that wins the coin toss has three options:&lt;ref name="Toss" /&gt;
# They may choose whether to kick or receive the opening kickoff.
# They may choose which goal to defend.
# They may choose to ''defer'' the first choice to the other team and have first choice to start the second half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-D8VQBFSG0.html| title=NFL Makes Some Rule Changes | year = 2008 | accessdate = 2008-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Whatever the first team chooses, the second team has the option on the other choice (for example, if the first team elects to receive at the start of the game, the second team can decide which goal to defend).

At the start of the second half, the options to kick, receive, or choose a goal to defend are presented to the captains again. The team which did not choose first to start the first half (or which deferred its privilege to choose first) now gets first choice of options.&lt;ref name="Toss" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NCAArules&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ncaa.org/library/rules/2005/2005_football_rules.pdf |format=PDF| title = 2005 Rules and Interpretations | publisher = National Collegiate Athletic Association | year = 2005 | accessdate = 2008-01-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071129100253/http://www.ncaa.org/library/rules/2005/2005_football_rules.pdf |archivedate = 2007-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game duration===
A standard football game consists of four 15-minute quarters (12-minute quarters in high-school football and often shorter at lower levels, usually one minute per grade [e.g. 9-minute quarters for freshman games]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://football.calsci.com/TheRules4.html|title=The Field|last=Lawrence|first=Mark|date=2002–2005|publisher=Mark Lawrence|accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a 12-minute [[half-time]] intermission (30 minutes in [[Super Bowl]]) after the second quarter in the NFL (college halftimes are 20 minutes; in high school the interval is 15 or 20 minutes; 10 minutes for lower grades).&lt;ref name="Beginner" /&gt; The clock stops after certain plays; therefore, a game can last considerably longer (often more than three hours in real time), and if a game is broadcast on [[television]], [[Television timeout|TV timeouts]] are taken at certain intervals of the game to broadcast [[advertising|commercials]] outside of game action. If an NFL game is tied after four quarters, the teams play an additional period, timed like the fourth quarter, lasting up to 10 minutes. There is a coin toss in the NFL just like the beginning of the game. If the receiving team scores a touchdown during the possession, they win. If they kick a field goal, then the other team gets a possession. If they score a touchdown, they win. If they tie the score by kicking a field goal, then the next team that scores wins. If the team with the first possession turns the ball over without scoring any points, then the first team to score, wins. If the defense scores a touchdown through an interception or fumble recovery, or they get a safety, then they win. In a regular-season NFL game, if no one scores in the overtime, the game ends tied. In an NFL playoff game, multiple 15-minute overtime periods are played, as needed, to determine a winner. These periods are timed as if a game had started over. In the extremely rare case a game would go as far as a third OT—which has never happened in the NFL—there would be no "halftime intermission"; play would resume with a kickoff similar to a normal third quarter.

College overtime rules are more complicated and are described in [[Overtime (sport)]].

===Advancing the ball===
Advancing the ball in American football resembles the ''six-tackle rule'' and the ''play-the-ball'' in [[rugby league]]. The team that takes possession of the ball (the '''[[American football#Offense|offense]]''') has four attempts, called '''[[Down (football)|downs]]''', in which to advance the ball {{convert|10|yd|m|1}} toward their opponent's (the '''[[American football#Defense|defense]]'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s) end zone. When the offense succeeds in gaining at least 10 yards, it gets a '''first down''', meaning the team has another set of four downs to gain yet another 10 yards or to score. If the offense fails to gain a first down (10 yards) after 4 downs, the other team gets possession of the ball at the point where the fourth down ended, beginning with their first down to advance the ball in the opposite direction.

Except at the beginning of halves and after scores, the ball is always put into play by a '''[[Snap (American football)|snap]]'''. Offensive players line up facing defensive players at the '''[[line of scrimmage]]''' (the position on the field where the play begins). One offensive player, the '''[[Center (football)|center]]''', then passes (or "snaps") the ball backwards between his legs to a teammate behind him, usually the '''[[quarterback]]'''.

Players can then advance the ball in two ways:
# By running with the ball, also known as '''[[Rush (football)|rushing]]'''.
# By throwing the ball to a teammate, known as a '''[[forward pass]]''' or as '''passing''' the football. The forward pass is a key factor distinguishing American and Canadian football from other football sports. The offense can throw the ball forward only once during a down and only from behind the line of scrimmage. The ball can be thrown, pitched, handed-off, or tossed sideways or backwards at any time.

A down ends, and the ball becomes dead, after any of the following:
* The player with the ball is forced to the ground (a '''[[tackle (football move)|tackle]]''') or has his forward progress halted by members of the other team (as determined by an '''[[Official (American football)|official]]''').
* A forward pass flies beyond the dimensions of the field ('''[[out of bounds]]''') or touches the ground before it is caught. This is known as an '''[[incomplete pass]]'''. The ball is returned to the most recent line of scrimmage for the next down.
* The ball or the player with the ball goes out of bounds.
* A team scores.

Officials blow a whistle to notify players that the down is over.

Before each down, each team chooses a '''[[Football play|play]]''', or coordinated movements and actions, that the players should follow on a down. Sometimes, downs themselves are referred to as "plays."

===Change of possession===
The offense maintains possession of the ball unless one of the following things occurs:
* The team fails to get a first down&amp;mdash; i.e., in four downs they fail to move the ball past a line 10 yards ahead of where they got their last first down (it is possible to be downed behind the current line of scrimmage, losing "yardage"). The defensive team takes over the ball at the spot where the 4th-down play ends. A change of possession in this manner is commonly called a '''[[turnover on downs]]''', but is not credited as a defensive "turnover" in official statistics. Instead, it goes against the offense's 4th down efficiency percentage.
* The offense scores a touchdown or field goal. The team that scored then kicks the ball to the other team in a special play called a '''[[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]]'''.
* The offense punts the ball to the defense. A '''[[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]]''' is a kick in which a player drops the ball and kicks it before it hits the ground. Punts are nearly always made on fourth down (though see '''''[[quick kick]]'''''), when the offensive team does not want to risk giving up the ball to the other team at its current spot on the field (through a failed attempt to make a first down) and feels it is too far from the other team's goal posts to attempt a field goal.
* A defensive player catches a forward pass. This is called an '''[[interception]]''', and the player who makes the interception can run with the ball until he is tackled, forced out of bounds, or scores.
* An offensive player drops the ball (a '''[[fumble]]''') and a defensive player picks it up. As with interceptions, a player recovering a fumble can run with the ball until tackled, forced out of bounds, or scores. Backward passes that are not caught do not cause the down to end like incomplete forward passes do; instead the ball is still live as if it had been fumbled. Lost fumbles and interceptions are together known as '''[[turnover (football)|turnovers]]'''.
* The offensive team misses a field goal attempt. The defensive team gets the ball at the spot where the previous play began (or, in the NFL, at the spot of the kick). If the unsuccessful kick was attempted from within {{convert|20|yd|m|1}} of the end zone, the other team gets the ball at its own 20-yard line (that is, 20 yards from the end zone). If a field goal is missed or blocked and the ball remains in the field of play, a defensive player may pick up the ball and attempt to advance it.
* While in his own end zone, an offensive ball carrier is tackled, forced out of bounds, loses the ball out of bounds, or the offense commits certain fouls. This fairly rare occurrence is called a '''[[Safety (American football score)|safety]]'''.
* An offensive ball carrier fumbles the ball forward into the opposing end zone, and then the ball goes out of bounds. This extremely rare occurrence leads to a '''[[touchback]]''', with the ball going over to the opposing team at their 20-yard line (Note that touchbacks during non-offensive special teams plays, such as punts and kickoffs, are quite common).

===Scoring===
A team scores points by the following plays:
* A '''[[touchdown]]''' (TD) is worth 6 points.&lt;ref name="Beginner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/beginnersguidetofootball|title=Beginner's Guide to Football|year=2009|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC|accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is scored when a player runs the ball into or catches a pass in his opponent's end zone.&lt;ref name="Beginner" /&gt; A touchdown is analogous to a [[try]] in rugby. Unlike rugby, a player does not have to touch the ball to the ground to score; a touchdown is scored any time a player has possession of the ball but not while the ball is on or beyond the opponents' goal line (or the plane above it).
** After a touchdown, the scoring team attempts a '''[[Try (American Football)|try]]''' (which is also analogous to the [[Try#Conversion|conversion in rugby]]). The ball is placed at the other team's {{convert|3|yd|m|1|adj=on}} line (the {{convert|2|yd|m|1|adj=on}} line in the NFL on 2-point conversions or {{convert|15|yd|m|1|adj=on}} for 1-point conversions). The team can attempt to kick it over the crossbar and through the goal posts in the manner of a field goal for 1 point (an '''[[extra point]]''' or '''point-after touchdown (PAT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = 2007 Official Rules of the NFL | publisher = Triumph Books |date=1 October 2007 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-1-60078-028-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''), or run or pass it into the end zone in the manner of a touchdown for 2 points (a '''[[two-point conversion]]'''). In college football, the NFL, and Massachusetts and Texas high school football, if the defense intercepts or recovers a fumble during a one or two-point conversion attempt and returns it to the opposing end zone, the defensive team is awarded the two points.
* A '''[[Field goal (gridiron football)|field goal]]''' (FG) is worth 3 points, and it is scored by kicking the ball over the crossbar and through the goal posts (uprights).&lt;ref name="Beginner" /&gt; Field goals may be placekicked (kicked when the ball is held vertically against the ground by a teammate) or [[drop kick|drop-kicked]] (extremely uncommon in the modern game, with only two successes in sixty-plus years in the NFL). A field goal is usually attempted on fourth down instead of a punt when the ball is close to the opponent's goal line, or, when there is little or no time left to otherwise score. A '''[[fair catch kick]]''' is also 3.
* A '''[[Safety (American football score)|safety]]''', worth 2 points, is scored by the opposing team when the team in possession at the end of a down is responsible for the ball becoming dead behind its own goal line. For instance, a safety is scored by the defense if an offensive player is tackled, goes out of bounds, or fumbles the ball out of bounds in his own end zone.&lt;ref name="Beginner" /&gt; Safeties are relatively rare. Note that, though even more rare, the team initially on offense during a down can score a safety if a player of the original defense gains possession of the ball in front of his own goal line and then carries the ball or fumbles it into his own end zone where it becomes dead. However, if the ball becomes dead behind the goal line of the team in possession and its opponent is responsible for the ball being there (for instance, if the defense intercepts a forward pass in its own end zone and the ball becomes dead before the ball is advanced out of the end zone) it is a touchback: no points are scored and the team last in possession keeps possession with a first down at its own 20-yard line. In amateur and pro football, in the extremely rare instance that a safety is scored on a try, it is worth only 1 point.

===Kickoffs and free kicks===
Each half begins with a [[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]]. Teams also kick off after scoring touchdowns and field goals. The ball is kicked using a kicking tee from the team's own {{convert|35|yd|m|adj=on}} line in the NFL and college football (as of the 2011 season). The other team's kick returner tries to catch the ball and advance it as far as possible. Where he is stopped is the point where the offense will begin its '''drive''', or series of offensive plays. If the kick returner catches the ball in his own end zone, he can either run with the ball, or elect for a '''[[touchback]]''' by kneeling in the end zone, in which case the receiving team then starts its offensive drive from its own 20-yard line (25-yard line in NFL, since 2015). A touchback also occurs when the kick goes out-of-bounds in the end zone, or since 2018, the ball hits the ground on the goal line and in the end zone. A kickoff that goes out-of-bounds anywhere other than the end zone before being touched by the receiving team is a foul, and the ball will be placed where it went out of bounds or {{convert|30|yd|m}} from the kickoff spot, depending on which is more advantageous to the opposite team.&lt;ref name="kickoff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/kickoff|title=Kickoff|year=2009|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC.|accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike with [[Punt (gridiron football)|punts]], once a kickoff goes 10 yards and the ball has hit the ground, it can be recovered by the kicking team.&lt;ref name="kickoff"/&gt; A team, especially one who is losing, can try to take advantage of this by attempting an [[onside kick]]. Punts and turnovers in the end zone can also end in a [[touchback]].

After safeties, the team that gave up the points must [[Safety (American football score)#Free kick|free kick]] the ball to the other team from its own 20-yard line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/safety|title=Safety|year=2009|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC.|accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Penalties===
{{main|Penalty (American football)}}

Fouls (a type of rule violation) are punished with '''penalties''' against the offending team. Most penalties result in moving the football towards the offending team's end zone. If the penalty would move the ball more than half the distance towards the offender's end zone, the penalty becomes half the distance to the goal instead of its normal value.

Most penalties result in replaying the down. Some defensive penalties give the offense an automatic first down.&lt;ref name="Penalty" /&gt; Conversely, some offensive penalties result in loss of a down (loss of the right to repeat the down).&lt;ref name="Penalty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/penaltysummaries|title=Penalty Summaries|year=2009|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC.|accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a penalty gives the offensive team enough yardage to gain a first down, they get a first down, as usual.

If a foul occurs during a down, an official throws a yellow [[penalty flag]] near the spot of the foul. When the down ends, the team that did not commit the foul has the option of accepting the penalty, or declining the penalty and accepting the result of the down.

===Variations===
Variations on these basic rules exist, particularly [[Touch football (American)|touch]] and [[flag football]], which are designed as non-contact or limited-contact alternatives to the relative [[violence]] of regular American football. In touch and flag football, tackling is not permitted. Offensive players are "tackled" when a defender tags them or removes a flag from their body, respectively. Both of these varieties are played mainly in informal settings such as [[Intramural sports|intramural]] or youth games. Another variation is "wrap", where a player is "tackled" when another player wraps his arms around the ball carrier. Professional, intercollegiate, and varsity-level high school football invariably use the standard tackling rules.

Another variation is with the number of players on the field. In sparsely populated areas, it is not uncommon to find high school football teams playing [[nine-man football]], [[eight-man football]] or [[six-man football]]. Players often play on offense as well as defense. The [[Arena Football League (1987–2008)|Arena Football League]] is a league that plays eight-man football, but also plays indoors and on a much smaller playing surface with rule changes to encourage a much more offensive game.

Another variation often played by American children is called Catch and Run. In this game, the children split into two teams and line up at opposite sides of the playing field. One side throws the ball to the other side. If the opposing team catches the ball, that player tries to run to the throwing teams touchdown without being tagged/tackled. If no one catches the ball or if the player is tagged/tackled, then that team has to throw the ball to the opposing team. This repeats until the game (or recess period) is deemed over.

==Canadian football (general)==
{{main|Canadian football|Comparison of Canadian and American football}}

===The field===
The Canadian football field is {{convert|110|yd}} long and {{convert|65|yd}} wide with [[end zone]]s {{convert|20|yd}} deep. At each goal line is a set of {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} [[goalposts]], which consist of two ''uprights'' joined by a {{convert|18.5|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} crossbar which is {{convert|10|ft|m}} above the goal line. The goalposts may be H-shaped (both posts fixed in the ground) although in the higher-calibre competitions the tuning-fork design (supported by a single curved post behind the goal line, so that each post starts {{convert|10|ft|m}} above the ground) is preferred. The sides of the field are marked by white sidelines, the goal line is marked in white, and white lines are drawn laterally across the field every {{convert|5|yd}} from the goal line.&lt;ref name=conversions&gt;'''Table of exact conversions'''

===Play of the game===
Teams advance across the field through the execution of quick, distinct plays, which involve the possession of a brown, [[prolate spheroid]] ball with ends tapered to a point. The ball has two one-inch-wide white stripes.

====Kickoff====
Play begins with one team place-kicking the ball from its own {{convert|35|yd|adj=on}} line.&lt;ref name=conversions/&gt; Both teams then attempt to catch the ball. The player who recovers the ball may run while holding the ball, or throw the ball to a teammate, so long as the throw is not forward.

====Stoppage of play====
Play stops when the ball carrier's knee, elbow, or any other body part aside from the feet and hands, is forced to the ground (a ''tackle''); when a touchdown (see below) or a field goal is scored; when the ball leaves the playing area by any means (being carried, thrown, or fumbled out of bounds); or when the ball carrier is in a standing position but can no longer move. If no score has been made, the next play starts from ''scrimmage''.

====Scrimmage====
Before scrimmage, an official places the ball at the spot it became dead, but no nearer than {{convert|24|yd}} from the sideline or {{convert|1|yd|adj=on}} from the goal line.&lt;ref name=conversions/&gt; The line parallel to the goal line passing through the ball (line from sideline to sideline for the length of the ball) is referred to as the line of scrimmage. This line is a sort of "no-man's land"; players must stay on their respective sides of this line until the play has begun again. For a scrimmage to be valid the team in possession of the football must have seven players, excluding the quarterback, within one yard of the line of scrimmage. The defending team must stay a yard or more back from the line of scrimmage.

====Live play====
On the field at the beginning of a play are two teams of 12 (unlike 11 in American football). The team in possession of the ball is the offence and the team defending is referred to as the defence.&lt;!-- Canadian spelling uses the "c" --&gt; Play begins with a backwards pass through the legs (the snap) by a member of the offensive team, to the quarterback or punter. If the quarterback or punter receives the ball, he may then do any of the following:

* run with the ball, attempting to run farther downfield (gaining yardage). The ball-carrier may run in any direction he sees fit (including backwards).
* ''drop-kick'' the ball, dropping it onto the ground and kicking it on the bounce. (This play is exceedingly rare in both Canadian and American football, although in the Canadian game it is sometimes used as a last-second "desperation play" if the team is behind by less than three points.)
* pass the ball laterally or backwards to a teammate. This play is known as a ''lateral'', and may come at any time on the play. A pass which has any amount of forward momentum is a ''forward pass'' (see below); forward passes are subject to many restrictions which do not apply to laterals.
* ''hand-off''—hand the ball off to a teammate, typically a halfback or the fullback.
* ''punt'' the ball; dropping it in the air and kicking it ''before'' it touches the ground. When the ball is punted, only opposing players (the receiving team), the kicker, and anyone behind the kicker when he punted the ball are able to touch the ball, or even go within five yards of the ball until it is touched by an eligible player (the No Yards rule, which is applied to all kicking plays).
* place the ball on the ground for a ''place kick''
* throw a ''[[forward pass]]'', where the ball is thrown to a receiver located farther downfield (closer to the opponent's goal) than the thrower is. Forward passes are subject to the following restrictions:
** They must be made from ''behind'' the line of scrimmage
** Only one forward pass may be made on a play
** The pass must be made in the direction of an eligible receiver.

Each play constitutes a ''down''. The offence must advance the ball at least ten yards towards the opponents' goal line within three downs or forfeit the ball to their opponents. Once ten yards have been gained the offence gains a new set of three downs (rather than the four downs given in American football). Downs do not accumulate. If the offensive team completes {{convert|10|yd}} on their first play, they lose the other two downs and are granted another set of three. If a team fails to gain ten yards in two downs they usually punt the ball on third down or try to kick a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] (see below), depending on their position on the field.

====Change in possession====
The ball changes possession in the following instances:

* If the offence scores a field goal, the scoring team must kickoff from their own {{convert|35|yd|adj=on}} line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/story/2009/05/11/sp-cfl-ruleschanges.html | work=CBC News | title=CFL introduces 4 rule changes for 2009 season | date=2009-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If the offence scores a touchdown, the scoring team must kickoff from their own {{convert|35|yd|adj=on}} line. This also applies when the defence scores on a turnover which is returned for a touchdown — technically, they become the offence until the conclusion of the play, and the scoring team must still kickoff.
* If the defence scores on a safety, they have the right to claim possession.
* If one team kicks the ball; the other team has the right to recover the ball and attempt a return. If a kicked ball goes out of bounds, or the kicking team scores a single or field goal as a result of the kick, the other team likewise gets possession.
* If the offence fails to make ten yards in three plays, the defense ''takes over on downs''.
* If the offence attempts a forward pass and it is ''intercepted'' by the defense; the defense takes possession immediately (and may try and advance the ball on the play). Note that incomplete forward passes (those which go out of bounds, or which touch the ground without being first cleanly caught by a player) result in the end of the play, and are not returnable by either team.
* If the offence ''fumbles'' (a ball carrier drops the football, or has it dislodged by an opponent, or if the intended player fails to catch a lateral pass or a snap from centre, or a kick attempt is blocked by an opponent), the ball may be recovered (and advanced) by either team. If a fumbled ball goes out of bounds, the team whose player last touched it is awarded possession at the spot where it went out of bounds. A fumble by the offence in their own end zone, which goes out of bounds, results in a safety.
* If the offence has committed two consecutive ''time counts'' — failed to put the ball in play within 20 seconds of the referee declaring the ball ready for play — on third down in the last three minutes of either half, the referee has the right to give possession to the defence. (This rule does not apply on convert attempts, which are untimed downs.)
* When the first half ends, the team which kicked to start the first half may receive a kickoff to start the second half.

====Rules of contact====
There are many rules to contact in this type of football. First, the only player on the field who may be legally tackled is the player currently in possession of the football (the ball carrier). Second, a receiver, that is to say, an offensive player sent down the field to receive a pass, may not be interfered with (have his motion impeded, be blocked, etc.) unless he is within one yard of the line of scrimmage (as opposed to {{convert|5|yd}} in American football). Any player may block another player's passage, so long as he does not hold or trip the player he intends to block. The kicker may not be contacted after the kick but before his kicking leg returns to the ground (this rule is not enforced upon a player who has blocked a kick), and the quarterback, having already thrown the ball, may not be hit or tackled.

====Infractions and penalties====
Infractions of the rules are punished with ''penalties'', typically a loss of yardage of 5, 10 or {{convert|15|yd}} against the penalized team.&lt;ref name=conversions/&gt; Minor violations such as ''offside'' (a player from either side encroaching into scrimmage zone before the play starts) are penalized five yards, more serious penalties (such as holding) are penalized {{convert|10|yd}}, and severe violations (such as face-masking) of the rules are typically penalized {{convert|15|yd}}. Depending on the penalty, the penalty yardage may be assessed from the original line of scrimmage, the spot the violation occurred, or the place the ball ended after the play. Penalties on the offence may, or may not, result in a loss of down; penalties on the defence may result in a first down being automatically awarded to the offence. For particularly severe conduct, the game official(s) may eject players (ejected players may be substituted for), or in exceptional cases, declare the game over and award victory to one side or the other. Penalties do not affect the yard line which the offence must reach in order to reach first down (unless the penalty results in a first down being awarded); if a penalty against the defence results in the first down yardage being attained, then the offence is awarded a first down.

Penalties may occur before a play starts (such as offsides), during the play (such as holding), or in a dead-ball situation (such as [[unsportsmanlike conduct]]).

Penalties never result in a score for the offence (a penalty by the defence committed in their end zone is not ruled a touchdown); on rare occasions, penalties against the offence in their own end zone may result in a safety being scored by the defence. If the penalty yardage, once assessed would move the ball into an end zone (or further than half the distance between the end zone and the spot the penalty is assessed from), a penalty of half-the-distance is assessed instead. Note that in Canadian football (unlike American football), no scrimmage may start inside either one-yard line.

In most cases, the non-penalized team will have the option of ''declining'' the penalty; in which case the results of the previous play stand as if the penalty had not been called. One notable exception to this rule is if the kicking team on a 3rd down punt play is penalized before the kick occurs; the receiving team may not decline the penalty and take over on downs. (After the kick is made, change of possession occurs and subsequent penalties are assessed against either the spot where the ball is caught, or the runback).

====Kicking====
Canadian football distinguishes three ways of kicking the ball:

; [[Place kick]] : Kicking a ball held on the ground by a teammate, or, on a kickoff (resuming play following a score), placed on a tee.
; [[Drop kick]] : Kicking a ball after bouncing it on the ground. Although rarely used today, it has the same status in scoring as a place kick. This play is part of the game's [[Rugby football|rugby]] heritage, and was largely made obsolete when the ball with pointed ends was adapted. Unlike the American game, Canadian rules allow a drop kick to be attempted at any time by any player, but the move is very rare.
; [[Punt (gridiron football)|Punt]] : Kicking the ball after it has been released from the kicker's hand and before it hits the ground. Punts may not score a field goal, even if one should travel through the uprights. As with drop kicks, players may punt at any time.

On punts and field goal attempts (but not kickoffs), members of the kicking team, other than the kicker and any teammates who are onside (behind the kicker at the time of the kick), may not approach within five yards of the ball until it has been touched by the receiving team.

====Scoring====
The methods of scoring are:

; Touchdown : Achieved when the ball is in possession of a player in the opponent's goal area, or when the ball in the possession of a player crosses or touches the plane of the opponent's goal-line, worth 6 points (5 points until 1956). A touchdown in Canadian football is often referred to as a "major score" or simply a "major."
; Conversion (or Convert) : After a touchdown, the team that scored attempts one scrimmage play from any point between the hash marks on or outside the opponents' {{convert|5|yd|adj=on}} line. If they make what would normally be a field goal, they score one point; what would normally be a touchdown scores two points (a "two-point conversion"). No matter what happens on the convert attempt, play then continues with a kickoff (see below).
; Field goal : Scored by a drop kick or place kick (except on a kickoff) when the ball, after being kicked and without again touching the ground, goes over the cross bar and between the goal posts (or between lines extended from the top of the goal posts) of the opponent's goal, worth three points.
; Safety : Scored when the ball becomes dead in the possession of a team in its own goal area, or when the ball touches or crosses the dead-line, or side-line-in-goal and touches the ground, a player, or some object beyond these lines as a result of the team scored against making a play. It is worth two points. This is different from a ''single'' (see below) in that the team scored against begins with possession of the ball. The most common safety is on a third down punt from the end zone, in which the kicker decides not to punt and keeps the ball in his team's own goal area. The ball is then turned over to the receiving team (who gained the two points), and they begin their first down possession play from their own {{convert|35|yd|adj=on}} line on their side of the field.
; Single : Scored when the ball becomes dead in the possession of a team in its own goal area, or when the ball touches or crosses the dead-line, or side-line-in-goal, and touches the ground, a player, or some object beyond these lines as a result of the ball having been kicked from the field of play into the goal area by the scoring team. It is worth one point. This is different from a safety (see above) in that team scored against receives possession of the ball after the score.
:Officially, the single is called a ''rouge'' ([[French language|French]] for "red") but is often referred to as a single. The exact derivation of the term is unknown but it has been thought that in early Canadian football, the scoring of a single was signaled with a red flag.

====Resumption of play====
Resumption of play following a score is conducted under procedures which vary with the type of score.

* Following a touchdown and convert attempt (successful or not), play resumes with the scoring team kicking off from its own {{convert|35|yd|adj=on}} line (45-yard line in amateur leagues).&lt;ref name=conversions/&gt;
* Following a field goal, the non-scoring team may choose for play to resume either with a kickoff as above, or by scrimmaging the ball from its own {{convert|35|yd|adj=on}} line.
* Following a safety, the scoring team may choose for play to resume in either of the above ways, or it may choose to kick off from its own {{convert|35|yd|adj=on}} line.
* Following a single or [[rouge (football)|rouge]], play resumes with the non-scoring team scrimmaging from its own {{convert|35|yd|adj=on}} line, unless the single is awarded on a missed field goal, in which case the non-scoring team scrimmages from either the {{convert|35|yd|adj=on}} line or the yard line from which the field goal was attempted, whichever is greater.

====Game timing====
The game consists of two 30-minute halves, each of which is divided into two 15-minute quarters. The clock counts down from 15:00 in each quarter. Timing rules change when there are three minutes remaining in a half.
A 2-minute interval occurs after the end of each quarter (15 minutes at halftime, except 30 minutes in [[Grey Cup]]), and the two teams then change goals.

In the first 27 minutes of a half, the clock stops when:
* points are scored,
* the ball goes out of bounds,
* a forward pass is incomplete,
* the ball is dead and a penalty flag has been thrown,
* the ball is dead and teams are making substitutions (e.g., possession has changed, punting situation, short yardage situation),
* the ball is dead and a player is injured, or
* the ball is dead and a captain calls a [[sport time-out|time-out]].

The clock starts again when the referee determines the ball is ready for scrimmage, except for team time-outs (where the clock starts at the snap), after a time count foul (at the snap) and kickoffs (where the clock starts not at the kick but when the ball is first touched after the kick).

In the last three minutes of a half, the clock stops whenever the ball becomes dead. On kickoffs, the clock starts when the ball is first touched after the kick. On scrimmages, when it starts depends on what ended the previous play. The clock starts when the ball is ready for scrimmage except that it starts on the snap when on the previous play
* the ball was kicked off,
* the ball was punted,
* the ball changed possession,
* the ball went out of bounds,
* there were points scored,
* there was an incomplete forward pass,
* there was a penalty applied (not declined), or
* there was a team time-out.

The clock does not run during convert attempts in the last three minutes of a half. If the 15 minutes of a quarter expire while the ball is live, the quarter is extended until the ball becomes dead. If a quarter's time expires while the ball is dead, the quarter is extended for one more scrimmage. A quarter cannot end while a penalty is pending: after the penalty yardage is applied, the quarter is extended one scrimmage. Note that the non-penalized team has the option to ''decline'' any penalty it considers disadvantageous, so a losing team cannot indefinitely prolong a game by repeatedly committing penalties.

In the event of a tie after regulation, teams get one possession from the opponents' 35-yard line. The overtime is untimed. Coin toss determines whether team receives first or defend; the teams turn about for the next overtime possession, if needed. Whoever is ahead after one possession wins it and two points in standings; if after two possessions in the regular season or preseason, a tie still persists, the game ends drawn, and one point in standings; however, in postseason, multiple overtime possessions are repeated until whoever is up, which wins the game. If a touchdown has been scored they must make a two-point conversion, unless they score enough beat their opponents.

==College football==
{{main|College football}}
Teams get 3 timeouts per half, which can't carry over to next half or overtime, plus one per overtime period (same as in the NFL, but allows two per overtime period).
Although rules for the high school, college, and NFL games are generally consistent, there are several minor differences. The NCAA Football Rules Committee determines the playing rules for Division I (both Bowl and Championship Subdivisions), II, and III games (the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA) is a separate organization, but uses the NCAA rules).
*A pass is ruled complete if one of the receiver's feet is inbounds at the time of the catch. In the NFL both feet must be inbounds.
*A player is considered down when any part of his body other than the feet or hands touches the ground (from a tackle or otherwise), with the sole exception of the holder for field goal and extra point attempts. In the NFL a player is active until he is tackled or forced down another way by a member of the opposing team (down by contact).
*The clock stops after the offense completes a first down and begins again—assuming it is following a play in which the clock would not normally stop—once  the referee declares the ball ready for play. In the NFL the clock does not explicitly stop for a first down.
*Overtime was introduced in 1996, eliminating ties. When a game goes to overtime, each team is given one possession from its opponent's twenty-five yard line with no game clock, despite the one timeout per period and use of play clock. The team leading after both possessions is declared the winner. If the teams remain tied, overtime periods continue, with a coin flip determining the first possession. Possessions alternate with each overtime, until one team leads the other at the end of the overtime. Starting with the 3rd overtime, a one-point PAT field goal after a touchdown is no longer allowed, forcing teams to attempt a two-point conversion after a touchdown. (In the NFL overtime is decided by a 10-minute [[Overtime (sports)#American and Canadian football|sudden-death quarter]], and regular season games can still end in a tie if neither team scores. Overtime for regular season games in the [[National Football League|NFL]] began with the {{NFL year|1974}} season, but reduced since {{NFL year|2017}}. In the post-season &amp; [[Pro Bowl]], if the teams are still tied, teams will play multiple 15-minute overtime periods until whoever scores.)
*[[Try (American Football)|Extra point tries]] are attempted from the three-yard line. The NFL uses the 2-yard line for 2-point conversions or 15-yard line for 1-point conversions.
*The defensive team may score two points on a point-after touchdown attempt by returning a blocked kick, fumble, or interception into the opposition's end zone. In addition, if the defensive team gains possession, but then moves backwards into the endzone and is stopped, a one-point safety will be awarded to the offense, although, unlike a real safety, the offense kicks off, opposed to the team charged with the safety. In the NFL, a conversion attempt ends when the defending team gains possession of the football.
*The [[two-minute warning]] is not used in college football, except in rare cases where the scoreboard clock has malfunctioned and is not being used.
*There is an option to use instant replay review of officiating decisions. Division I FBS (formerly Division I-A) schools use replay in virtually all games; replay is rarely used in lower division games. Every play is subject to booth review with coaches only having one challenge. In the NFL, challenges are only automatic in the final two minutes of each half or the entire overtime.
*In the 2006 season, the game clock was started when the ball was declared ready for play after the defensive team (during a scrimmage down) or the receiving kick (during a free kick down) was awarded a first down, reducing the time of games. This rule only lasted one year.
*In the 1984 season, the ball was placed on the 30-yard line (instead of the 20) if a kickoff sailed through the end zone on the fly and untouched. This rule was rescinded after one year.
*Among other rule changes to 2007, kickoffs have been moved from the 35-yard line back five yards to the 30-yard line to match that of the NFL. Some coaches and officials are questioning this rule change as it could lead to more injuries to the players as there will likely be more kickoff returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Kickoffs from 30 yard line could create more returns, injuries | url=https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/news?slug=ap-ncaa-rules&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns | publisher=AP | date=April 16, 2007 | accessdate=2007-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for the rule change was to help reduce dead time in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=NCAA Football Rules Committee Votes To Restore Plays While Attempting To Maintain Shorter Overall Game Time | url=http://www2.ncaa.org/portal/media_and_events/press_room/2007/february/20070214_football_cmtee_rls.html | publisher=NCAA | date=2007-02-14 | accessdate=2007-08-17 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210117/http://www2.ncaa.org/portal/media_and_events/press_room/2007/february/20070214_football_cmtee_rls.html | archivedate=2007-09-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the NFL would move its kickoffs back to the 35-yard line for the 2011 season; the NCAA followed suit one year later.

==High school football==
{{main|High school football}}

The [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] (NFHS) establishes the rules of High School Football. Two states, [[Texas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uil.utexas.edu/policy/constitution/athletics/09_10sec1207_1210.pdf |title=Section 1208(g): Playing Rules |work=100th Edition of the Constitution and Contest Rules of the University Interscholastic League |format=PDF |publisher=[[University Interscholastic League]] |date=2009–2010 |accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tapps.net/PDF/Constitution/AthleticContestRules/SubChapterE/athleticsubchapterEsection159.pdf |title=Section 159: Rules |work=Contest Rules: Football Qualifications |format=PDF |publisher=[[Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools]] |date=2009–2010 |accessdate=2009-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201082203/http://tapps.net/PDF/Constitution/AthleticContestRules/SubChapterE/athleticsubchapterEsection159.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miaa.net/MIAA-Handbook-09-11.pdf |title=Rule 69.1 |work=Rules and Regulations Governing Athletics |format=PDF |publisher=[[Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association]] |date=July 1, 2009 – June 30, 2011 |accessdate=2009-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116082844/http://www.miaa.net/MIAA-Handbook-09-11.pdf |archivedate=November 16, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; use [[NCAA]] playing rules.

With their common ancestry, the NFHS rules of high school football are largely similar to the college game, though with some important differences:
* The four quarters are each 12 minutes, as opposed to 15 minutes in all other forms of the game; this includes Texas (all games) and Massachusetts (regular season). The only exception is that Massachusetts playoff games use 10-minute quarters, largely because the state's playoff structure frequently calls for teams to play more than one game in a week.
* Kickoffs take place at the kicking team's 40-yard line, as opposed to the 35 in college and the [[National Football League|NFL]]. This rule is also used by Texas and Massachusetts.
* If a ball crosses the plane of the goal line on a missed [[Field goal (football)|field goal]], it would be a [[touchback]] and the opposing team will start at the 20-yard line. In Massachusetts and Texas, the ball goes back to the line of scrimmage, except if the line of scrimmage was inside the 20-yard line, in which case, the ball is returned to the 20.
* Any kick crossing the goal line is automatically a touchback; kicks cannot be returned out of the end zone.
* Pass interference by the defence results in a 15-yard penalty, regardless of where the foul occurred (unlike the pro ranks where the ball is placed at the spot of the foul).
* The defence cannot return an extra-point attempt for a score, except Massachusetts &amp; Texas.
* The use of overtime, and the type of overtime used, is up to the individual state associations.

At least one high school rule has been adopted by college football.  In 1996, the [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] rules originally utilized by [[Kansas State High School Activities Association|Kansas high school teams]] were adopted by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], except with the starting point at the 25-yard line instead of the 10-yard line as prescribed in the NFHS rules, but under NFHS rules, states may opt to start each period from another point (such as the 20 or 25).

==Indoor football==
{{main|Indoor American football}}

Play in all forms of indoor football has tended to emphasize the forward passing game at the expense of rushing the football.  Whereas in a typical National Football League game perhaps half of the total offensive plays are rushing plays and 35 or 40 per cent of all of the yardage gained comes from rushing plays, in Arena and other indoor football it is far more common for rushing plays to constitute only 10 per cent of the offense, or even less in some instances.

===World Series of Pro Football===
The first documented indoor football games were those played at [[Madison Square Garden]] in 1902 and 1903 known as the "[[World Series of Football (1902)|World Series of Pro Football]]." They were the first efforts at a national professional football championship. The games were played on a 70-yard by 35-yard dirt field but otherwise adhered to outdoor rules. Poor attendance led to the tournament being discontinued for 1904. Madison Square Garden had to be redone to accommodate the teams. The wooden flooring of the arena was removed and replaced by an earthen surface. The goal lines were only 70 yards apart and the playing field was only 35 yards wide. (Since was in the era before the [[forward pass]], there were no [[end zone]]s, as they had not yet been invented.) The earthen surface became sticky as the game progressed and made for some tough maneuvering, while the stands were right up to the playing field and proved to be a physical hazard.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.footballhistorian.com/football_heroes.cfm?page=8&lt;/ref&gt; The kicking game was also drastically affected. In a game on a normal field, the team with the longest punts had the advantage. However, the Gardens proved to be a dream for a weak punter, due to the field size. Also the arena wall was right on the edge of the field, presenting a serious hazard on any sideline plays. One player knocked himself out of the tournament by running into the wall on the opening kickoff.

===1932 NFL Playoff Game in Chicago Stadium===
The first major indoor football game was the [[NFL Playoff Game, 1932|1932 NFL Playoff Game]], which was played indoors in the [[Chicago Stadium]] due to a severe blizzard that prevented playing the game outside. A dirt floor was brought in, and to compensate for the 80-yard length of the field, the teams' positions were reset back twenty yards upon crossing midfield.

===Arena Football League===
{{main|Arena Football League (1987–2008, since 2010)#Rules|Arena football#Rules of the game}}

* The Field: An indoor padded surface {{convert|85|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|50|yd|m}} long with {{convert|8|yd|m|adj=on}} endzones. Goal posts are {{convert|9|ft|m}} wide with a crossbar height of {{convert|15|ft|m}} ([[National Football League|NFL]] goalposts are {{convert|18.5|ft|m}} wide with the crossbar at {{convert|10|ft|m}}). The goalside rebound nets are {{convert|30|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|32|ft|m}} high. The bottom of the nets are {{convert|8|ft|m}} above the ground. Sideline barriers are {{convert|48|in|m}} high and made of high density foam rubber.
* The Equipment: The official football is the same size and weight as the National Football League ball.
* The Players and Formations: Eight players on the field; 21-man active roster; four-man inactive roster.
* Substitution: Free substitution is allowed, but some players play both ways either by choice or to step in because of [[injury]].
* Formation: Four (4) offensive players must line up on the line of scrimmage. Three (3) defensive players must be down linemen (in a three or four-point stance). Only the "Mac Linebacker" may blitz on either side of the center. Alignment is two (2) or more yards off the line of scrimmage. No stunting or twisting. Offensive motion in the backfield: One receiver may go in a forward motion before the snap.
* Timing: Four 15-minute quarters with a 15-minute halftime (30-minute halftime in [[ArenaBowl]]). The clock stops for out-of-bounds plays or incomplete passes only in the last minute of each half and overtime or when the referee deems it necessary for penalties, injuries or timeouts. Each team is allowed three (3) time-outs per half, and two per overtime period if regulation ends tied. In the last minute of the game, the clock will run if team has lead and quarterback decides to kneel down. 32-second play clock.
* Movement of the Ball and Scoring: Four (4) downs are allowed to advance the ball ten (10) yards for a first down, or to score. Six (6) points for a touchdown. One (1) point for a conversion by place kick after a touchdown or if safety is scored off any conversion attempt, two (2) points for a conversion by drop kick and two (2) points for successful run or pass after a touchdown. Three (3) points for a field goal or fair catch kick by placement or four (4) points by drop kick. Two (2) points for safeties or defending team's turnover off conversion attempt returned for touchdown.
* Kicking: Kickoffs are from the goal line. Kickers may use a one-inch tee. Punting is illegal. On fourth down, a team may go for a first down, touchdown or field goal. The receiving team may field any kickoff or missed field goal that rebounds off the net. Any kickoff untouched which is out of bounds or hitting an overhead structure (i.e. scoreboard) will be placed at the 20-yard line or the place where it went out of bounds, whichever is more advantageous to the receiving team. If a kickoff goes beyond the end zone and stays in bounds (such as kicking it into the field goal "slack net" or if the ball goes under the net), the ball will come out to the 5-yard line. The same is true if a missed field goal attempt goes beyond the end zone and under the net. If the receiving player chooses not to take the ball out of the endzone (takes a knee) or is tackled in the endzone, the ball is placed on the 2½-yard line.
* Passing: Passing rules in Arena Football are the same as outdoor [[NCAA football]] in which receivers must have one foot inbounds. A unique exception involves the rebound nets. A forward pass that rebounds off of the endzone net is a live ball and is in play until it touches the playing surface.
* Overtime Rules: Overtime periods are 15 minutes during the regular season and the playoffs. In the first overtime each team gets one possession to score. Whoever is ahead after one possession will win. If the teams are tied after each has had a possession, whoever scores next will win. Multiple overtime periods will be played in case of a tie and play continues in true [[sudden death (sports)|sudden death]] thereafter. Exception applies to second game of semifinal series, where there is no overtime, and the game may end tied - provided one team won the first game.
* Coaching challenges: coaches are allowed 2 (two) challenges per game; to do so, coaches throw the red flag before the next play. If the play stands as called after the play is reviewed they lose a timeout; however, if it is reversed they keep their timeouts. If a team wins two straight challenges they are granted a third. All challenges are automatic in the final minute of each half &amp; all overtime periods, as does scoring plays &amp; turnovers.
* Defending players may not jump offside twice in either half; they risk ejection for rest of half if they do. They cannot jump offside during overtime, or they risk disqualification. This penalty is enforced besides yardage penalty.
* Any player who targets, such as using the helmet to ram opponents, risk immediate disqualification plus a 15-yard penalty.

===American Indoor Football Association===
{{main|American Indoor Football Association}}
*The AIFA does not use the rebound net found in the [[Arena Football League (1987–2008)|Arena Football League]].
*One linebacker may move flat to flat but must stay in drop zone.
*Platooning and free substitution is allowed, meaning players do not have to play both offense and defense.
*Franchises must have at least 9 players that originate from within a 120-mile radius of the team's home town.
*The AIFA ball pattern is similar to that of the basketball in the [[American Basketball Association (1967-1976)|American Basketball Association]], with red, white, and blue panels as opposed to the brown colored football of most leagues.

Two rule changes appear to be inspired by [[Canadian football]] rules:

*Two offensive players may be in motion at one time. The AFL allows only one in motion.
*The AIFA recognizes the [[single (football)|single]] (also known as an uno or rouge).  If a kickoff goes through the uprights, or if the receiving team does not advance the ball out of the end zone on a kickoff, the kicking team is awarded one point and the ball is spotted at the opponent's five-yard line.

===Continental Indoor Football League===
{{main|Continental Indoor Football League}}

'''Field Size''' – 50 yards long by 25 yards wide, with end zones a minimum of 5 yards in depth. Fields may vary in size due to physical constraints within facility, with CIFL permission. End zones may be rounded due to hockey board configurations. Padded dasher board walls around the entire field that act as an extension of the ground (only "out of bounds" if contact made by opposing player that forces player into the dasher wall, much like a ‘down by contact’ rule).

'''Goal Posts''' – Goal posts are 12 feet from the floor to the crossbar. The crossbar is 10 feet wide. Anything used to hang the goalpost is considered a part of the upright.

'''Number Of Players''' – Seven players per team on the field at one time. Maximum of 20 active players with a 21st player that is only eligible for special-teams plays (kickoffs, field goals, point-after-touchdown plays).

'''Playing Time''' – Four 15-minute quarters with a running clock. Clock only stops for incomplete passes and out of bounds plays during the final minute of the halves. 25-second play clock.

'''Scoring''' – 6 points for TD, 2 points for run or pass conversion, or drop kick PAT, 1 point for place kick PAT, 2 points for defensive conversion following TD, 2 points for safety. 3 points for a field goal, 4 points for a drop kick field goal.

'''Backfield in Motion''' – One player may be in motion in any direction behind the line of scrimmage prior to the snap.

'''Offensive Linemen''' – Three linemen must be in a three- or four-point stance prior to the snap. They must line up guard, center, guard and next to one another. Any offensive lineman not covered up by the fourth man on the line of scrimmage is an eligible receiver if he is wearing an eligible receiver number (1-49, 80-89).

'''Defensive Linemen''' – There must be three defensive linemen, and they must line up on the nose, or can line up inside foot-to-outside foot outside of an offensive lineman Linemen must rush inside if nose up or slanted into if shaded, and they must make contact before any movement to the outside is made.

'''Blitzing''' – Only one non-lineman can blitz at a time. This player can blitz from any direction, but must be at least five yards off the line of scrimmage/goal line prior to the snap. Players do not have to announce their eligibility to blitz.

'''Linebackers''' – At least two defensive players must line up at least 5 yards behind the line of scrimmage. The other two non-linemen must either line up face-to-face with an offensive non-lineman on the line, or be five yards behind the line of scrimmage. After the snap, this rule is eliminated and the players can roam anywhere they wish, provided it doesn’t violate blitzing rules. Linebackers can line up at the goal line if the offense is within five yards of scoring.

'''Kickoffs''' – If a kickoff leaves the field of play on the fly, the ball comes out to the 25-yard line. The sideline walls and end zone walls are not out of bounds, and balls can be played off of them. If a kickoff leaves the field of play after making contact with the field or a player on either team, the ball comes out to the 5-yard line, or the point in which it leaves the field of play, whichever is closest to the kicking team’s goal line.

'''Offense''' – No punting. Offense must attempt to gain a first down or touchdown, or may attempt a field goal (by placement or drop kick).

'''Coaches''' – One coach from each team is allowed on the field during game time, but must stay a required distance from the dasher boards.

'''Overtime''' – Overtime is played with NCAA-style rules (each team gets one possession), but each possession is started with a kickoff rather than at the 25-yard line. Teams must go for a two-point conversion (by scrimmage play) starting with the third overtime session.

The most notable rule difference in the CIFL from other indoor football leagues is that the CIFL plays seven players to a side, as opposed to most indoor leagues, which play [[eight-man football|eight men to a side]].

The league does not utilize a rebound net, but otherwise, its rules are nearly identical to those of the [[Arena Football League (1987–2008)|Arena Football League]].

===United Indoor Football===
{{main|United Indoor Football}}
The field is the same width (85&amp;nbsp;feet) as a standard [[National Hockey League|NHL]] hockey rink. The field is 50 [[yard]]s long with up to an 8-yard [[end zone]].  (End zones may be a lesser depth with League approval.)  Depending on the stadium in which a game is being played, the end zones may be rectangular (like a basketball court) or curved (like a hockey rink). There is a heavily padded wall on each sideline, with the padding placed on top of the hockey dasher boards. The field goal uprights are 9 feet wide, and the crossbar is 18 feet above the playing surface.  Unlike [[Arena football]], the ball is not "live" when rebounded off the nets behind the end zone, or their support apparatuses.

A player is counted as out of bounds on the sidelines if they come into contact or fall over the boundary wall.

Each team fields eight players at a time from a 21-man active roster.

====Substitution rules====
A substitute may enter the field of play any time the ball is dead.  However, a substitute must remain on the field for at least one play.  Substitutions are not permitted by rule in any way that shall deceive an opponent.  A team that breaks a huddle with more than eight players commits an '''illegal substitution''' infraction, for which a 5-yard penalty is immediately assessed.  A team that begins a play from scrimmage with more than eight players commits an '''illegal participation''' infraction, for which a 10-yard penalty is immediately assessed.

====Formations====
The '''Offensive Box''' is defined as the area bordered by the outside shoulders of the two [[Offensive guard]]s, the line of scrimmage, and the distance of five yards behind the line of scrimmage on the offensive side of the ball.  Four offensive players must be on the [[line of scrimmage]] at the [[Snap (football)|snap]], with no more than three of said players in the Offensive Box.  The [[Offensive guard]]s and [[Center (American football)|center]] must wear numbers that denote they are ineligible to carry the ball nor may they release downfield on pass plays.  All players outside the Offensive Box must be at least two yards outside the shoulders of an [[Offensive guard]], and no closer than one yard to another player.  No more than two backs (including the [[Quarterback]]) may be in the Offensive Box at the snap.

Up to two players may be in motion on the offense prior to the snap.  Any man in motion must begin in the box.  One offensive player may be moving forward at the time of the snap, but all players in motion must be outside the Offensive Box at the snap.  There are special rules that prevent a man in motion from blocking defenders below the waistline.  A man in motion is also prevented from blocking defensive linemen or the blitzing [[linebacker]].

The '''Defensive Box''' is defined as the area bordered by the outside shoulders of the two [[Offensive guard]]s, the line of scrimmage, and the distance of five yards beyond the line of scrimmage on the defensive side of the ball.  Three defensive players must be in a three- or four-point stance at the start of the snap. One defender serving as a [[linebacker]] outside the Defensive Box may raise their hand prior to the snap to signify their intent to rush.  Defenders that begin in the Defensive Box must make contact with one of the [[Offensive linemen]] before they are allowed to drop back into pass coverage.  Defenders that begin outside the Defensive Box may approach the line of scrimmage to align themselves with an offensive player granted they do so at least two yards outside the shoulders of the [[Offensive guard]].

====Ball movement====
The ball is kicked off from the goal line.  The team with the ball is given four [[Down (football)|downs]] to gain ten yards or score. [[Punt (gridiron football)|Punting]] is illegal because of the size of the playing field. A [[Wide receiver|receiver]] jumping to catch a pass needs to get only one foot down in bounds for the catch to be deemed a completed catch.  Balls that bounce off the padded walls that surround the field are live. The defending team may return missed [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] attempts that fall short of the end zone.  If a free kick strikes the ceiling or any object hanging from said ceiling, while over the field of play, it is immediately dead, and it belongs to the receiving team 5 yards from mid-field.

====Scoring====
The scoring is the same as in the NFL with the addition of a [[drop kick]] field goal worth four points during normal play or two points as a post-touchdown conversion. Blocked extra points and turnovers on two-point conversion attempts may be returned by the defensive team for two points.  A '''[[single (football)|rouge]]-kickoff''' downed in the end zone is worth 1 point to the kicking team; a rogue-kickoff is when the kick returner is caught in his own end zone.  A free kick recovered in the end zone by the kicking team is considered a touchdown.

===Timing===
A game consists of four 15-minute quarters with a 20-minute halftime intermission.  The clock typically only stops for time-outs, penalties, injuries, and official clarifications.  Further stoppages occur for incomplete passes and out of bounds during the final 90 seconds of the halves.  A mandatory official's time-out, called a '''promotional timeout''', is assessed after the first and fourth quarters and is 90 seconds in duration.  Another mandatory official's time-out, called a warning period, is assessed with 90 seconds to play at the end of each half.  The game may also be stopped for further promotional time-outs, but must not exceed 90 seconds per league rules.

===Overtime rules===
Each team will get a possession from the 25-yard line to try and score. If one team out scores the other on the possession, the game is over. If still tied after an Overtime possession, the procedure is repeated until whoever is up, which wins the game.

===World Indoor Football League===

The proposed [[World Indoor Football League]] of 1988 proposed that eight players play on offense and seven players play on defense. It was otherwise similar to other indoor football leagues.

==Street football==
{{main|Street football (American)}}

{{original research|section|date=January 2015}}

The teams organize each other at the beginning of the game; if there are no pre-selected teams, a draft is held on the spot from the available players. In the event of an odd number of players, one player will usually serve as an "all time quarterback," who plays on offense the whole game and cannot run the ball past the line of scrimmage, or, if more players are on their way, the team who is short handed will automatically draft the newcomer upon arrival.

The two teams organize on opposite sides of the field for the kickoff. Because of skill, field size and other issues, this is usually not a kickoff but rather a punt-off or a throw-off. Many versions skip this process and start the offense at a certain point, similar to a [[touchback]] in [[NFL]] or other national leagues.

As in regular American football, each team usually has four downs per series. In order to achieve a series of downs, backyard football requires the team with the ball to complete two passes or reach a certain point on the field. Few games include enough people to run a [[chain crew]] to maintain the 10 yard familiar in most organized leagues. These structures encourages passing plays over running, as does the usual lack of offensive and defensive lines. Play continues until there is a turnover on downs (i.e. the offensive team fails to complete two passes in four downs), an [[interception]] occurs, or the team on offense scores a [[touchdown]]. Touchdowns are worth 6, 7, or 1 point(s) depending on the rules set out before the game.

Field goals and extra point kicks are nonexistent (streets and backyards have no goal posts), although punts can frequently happen, usually during "4th and 2 completions" situations where the offensive team cannot earn a first down. (In games played on regulation fields, these kicks can be attempted, but only in certain scoring systems.)

In the event a touchdown is scored, the team on offense will normally stay in the end zone in which they had just scored and the other team will go into the main field and field the subsequent kickoff. Thus, until an interception or turnover on downs, both teams defend and attempt to score on the same end zone.

Rules greatly vary from neighborhood to neighborhood, and are customarily set before each game. There can be a rush on the QB depending on the rules set out before the game. Usually if rushes are allowed, there are 2 rules that are commonly applied; Call rush and blitz count. Call rush is the first rule of rushing the QB in street. This is where the defense calls "Blitz" in a loud voice before the offense hikes the ball, signifying that they will rush, but there is also a counter effect with this. The QB can get out of the pocket and run without having to pass or hand off the ball, also the quarterback can call "shotgun" before or after the other team says "blitz" causing the opposite to have to count to 5 or 10 depending on whether or not they called blitz 5 calling "[[shotgun formation|shotgun]]" adds 5 seconds to the blitz count.  The second, and more common, rush QB rule is Mississippi rush (a blitz count), so called because the blitzing player must insert the word "[[Mississippi]]" between numbers so as not to allow the player to count ridiculously fast and effectively give the quarterback no time to throw.  Sometimes the two rules are combined, allowing one separate call of "Blitz!" per set of 4 downs.  The other option to handle a rush is to use an offensive lineman or center to block any pass rush. A line is rare in street, and the act of a center snapping to a quarterback is completely optional. Most teams that use a line opt for 3 down linemen(1 center and 2 guards). Some organizations that don't require the center to snap the ball to the quarterback only use 2 linemen.

[[Two-point conversion|Conversions after a TD]] usually aren't applied and they can only be attempted from the 6 (or occasionally 7) point TD system, but if they are, there are several conversion systems, including "single point," "pass-run," yardage and "runback." The single-point is the simplest of the rules, in which any successful conversion is worth one point. Pass run is used in some midget leagues and awards 2 points for a pass and one point for a run. Usually all pass-run conversions are attempted from the 1 or 2-yard line. The second conversion system is the yardage system, similar to that used in the [[XFL]] playoffs and the proposed [[United States Football League (2010)|New USFL]]. The yardage system is formatted like this: 1 point conversions are attempted from the 1 or 5-yard line, and 2-point conversions are attempted from the 2 or 10-yard line. The runback is the most rare of the conversion rules, and is most often implemented in one-on-one games. In this version, the play does not end once the ball crosses the goal line; instead, the player with the ball must change direction and advance it all the way back to the other end zone for two points.

The game ends when a pre-determined number of touchdowns or points has been scored, or an arbitrary time is reached (for instance, dusk or the start of school).

Penalties are rare and are usually only enforced in the most egregious cases, such as serious injuries.

==Touch football==
{{main|Touch football (American)}}

Depending on the skill of the players, the available playing field, and the purpose of the game, the rules other than the tackling aspect may remain mostly the same or vary considerably from traditional American football.  Touch football can be played by teams as few as two or as many as eleven on each side; usually, games consist of teams of four to seven.

Positions in touch football are far less formal than its more organized counterpart. While some games roughly follow conventions, more often, all players will be considered [[eligible receiver]]s (as in [[six-man football]]), and there are usually no [[running back]]s. There may or may not be a [[Center (American football)|snapper]]; if there is not, the quarterback initiates play by hovering the ball above the line of scrimmage and pulling it backward to simulate a snap.

Generally, in touch football, nearly every play is a passing play, whereas run plays and pass plays tend to be well balanced in organized football.  Some games will also implement a "blitz count", or a period of time that must elapse after the [[snap (American football)|snap]] before the defense may cross the [[line of scrimmage]] in order to attempt to tackle the [[quarterback]].  The count thus gives the quarterback time to complete a [[forward pass|pass]] in the absence of effective blocking (when teams are small, there is often no blocking at all).  Other games will not use a count and thus blocking becomes important. Conversely, in the presence of a "blitz count" there is also often a "QB sneak" rule, which prevents the quarterback from taking unfair advantage of the blitz count by preventing the quarterback from crossing the line of scrimmage before the blitz count is finished.

Because of these rules, passing plays are far more common than running plays in touch football.

Along with the size of the teams, the size of the field can vary considerably.  In a park, or spring practice situation, a full-sized field may be available, but many games are played in the front and back yards of suburban and rural village neighborhoods, where the whole field may not be much more than ten to thirty yards long.  In most of these situations, there are no yard lines, requiring some change in the definition of a [[first down]].  Instead of requiring that a team advance the ball ten yards, sometimes two pass completions result in a first down.  Another option is to eliminate first downs entirely, so that a team gets four (sometimes five) chances to score.

When it is desired for an odd number of players to play, it is common to allow one player to be an "all-time Quarterback" player; this player will always be on the [[offense (sports)|offense]] or the kicking team, switching sides throughout the game. When this occurs, there is usually no blitz count and the all-time quarterback is usually never allowed to cross the line of scrimmage.

Another common variation is the elimination of the [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] and [[extra point]] kick; this is usually due to the absence of goal posts and tees on the field as well as due to poor kicking skill by the participants.  Some games eliminate kicking altogether, directing the teams to start each possession after a [[touchdown]] at the twenty-yard line, as if a [[kickoff (American football)|kickoff]] and [[touchback]] had just occurred; other players prefer to change the kickoff into a "throw-off" or a "[[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]]-off."

Scoring and game timing are much different in touch football than its more organized counterpart. For the sake of simplicity, [[touchdown]]s are usually worth 1 point and no other scoring is counted (there are no [[extra point]] attempts). In a much lesser used variation, a touchdown is worth 6 points and if the player who scored the touchdown can progress in the other direction from the end zone in which he had just scored back to the opposite end zone without being touched, it counts as a [[two-point conversion]]. The former scoring method does not allow for other scoring types such as [[safety (American football score)|safeties]]. There is usually no [[game clock]] and the game ends when one opponent has reached 10 touchdowns (in the former convention) or 100 points (in a standard convention).

* Touch football is generally played by amateurs, often [[teenagers]] or [[children]].
* In Mexico the "touch football" is also known with the nickname of "tochito", nickname from the name of the game.
* During Thanksgiving, many Americans are known to play in "[[American football on Thanksgiving#Turkey Bowl|Turkey Bowls]]," games of touch or tackle football (without football pads) between family and friends.
* During offseason spring workouts, many high school and college teams play touch football to work on passing formations and plays.

==Professional football (American)==
{{main|List of leagues of American and Canadian football}}

===American Football League===
{{main|American Football League|AFL%E2%80%93NFL_merger#Emergence_of_the_AFL}}

The NFL adopted many ideas introduced by the AFL, including names on player jerseys and revenue sharing of gate and television receipts.  The older league also adopted the practice of using the stadium scoreboard clocks to keep track of the official game time, instead of just having a [[stopwatch]] used by the referee. The AFL played a 14-game schedule for its entire existence, starting in 1960.  The NFL, which had played a 12-game schedule since 1947, changed to a 14-game schedule in 1961, a year after the American Football League instituted it; it has been 16-game seasons since 1978.  The AFL also introduced the [[two-point conversion]] to professional football thirty-four years before the NFL instituted it in 1994 (college football had adopted the two-point conversion in the late 1950s).  All of these innovations pioneered by the AFL, including its more exciting style of play and colorful uniforms, have essentially made today's pro football more like the ''AFL'' than like the old-line NFL.  The AFL's challenge to the NFL also laid the groundwork for the [[Super Bowl]], which has become the standard for championship contests in the United States.

===NFL Europa===
{{main|NFL Europa}}

The NFL has traditionally used a [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] format for overtime. Regular-season games have a single period of overtime during which the first team to score wins the game. If neither team scores, the game is declared a tie. In post-season games, overtime is extended indefinitely until one team scores. In NFL Europa, however, the overtime period lasted for 10 minutes with the requirement that each team must have the opportunity of possession at least once. So, in NFL Europa, it was possible for one team to score in overtime, then have to kick off to the opponent and give them a chance to either equalize or win the game. The winner was the team with the highest score after both teams had had possession. If the score was even after the second team's possession, the overtime would continue as sudden death.  If still tied after 10 minutes, the game ends as a tie.  Only two games ever remained tied after overtime in WLAF/NFL Europa history: London Monarchs versus [[Birmingham Fire]] in Week 4 of the 1992 season, and Berlin Thunder at Hamburg Sea Devils, on April 1, 2006. The score of both games was 17–17.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/news/story/9363471 Europass: Unusual tie is Thunder's gain] NFL.com. Accessed 29 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[association football]] being the traditionally popular sport in Europe and [[American football]] being a relative newcomer, the rules were changed slightly to encourage a greater element of kicking, which was intended to make the game more enjoyable for football and [[Rugby football|rugby]] fans. The league did this by awarding 4 points to [[Field goal (football)|field goal]]s of more than 50 yards, as opposed to 3 points in the NFL. This had the interesting side-effect that a touchdown and PAT lead (7 points) could be equaled by one regular field goal (3 points) as well as a long field goal (4 points). This concept would later be adopted by the proposed [[United States Football League (2010)|New United States Football League]], with the distance required for the fourth point increased from 50 to 55 yards.

Also, there was a requirement that at least one player of Non-American extraction, referred to as "national" players, participate in every down for both teams as of the 2006 season (in previous seasons one was required to play only on every down of every other series). In addition to European players a number of [[Mexico|Mexican]] and [[Japan]]ese players played as national players. Up until the 2004 season, kicked conversion attempts and short field goals were attempted by national players. Since there are few European players who have had the chance to compete at a level comparable to U.S. [[college football]] and the NFL, many, if not most, of the European players ended up as kickers.

Among the notable national players were [[Scott McCready]], an [[England|English]] [[wide receiver]] who played some preseason games for the [[New England Patriots]], the Claymores' wide receiver [[Scott Couper]], who played a pre-season game for the [[Chicago Bears]], [[Constantin Ritzmann]], a [[Germany|German]] [[defensive end]] who had played for the [[University of Tennessee]], and [[Rob Hart]], an English [[Rugby football|rugby]] player who became a [[placekicker]]; he kicked [[barefoot]].

===United Football League===
{{main|United Football League (2009)}}

Like previous football leagues, the UFL has instituted several mostly minor rules changes that will differ from the NFL's rules. Though the league has indicated it would mostly adhere to standard rules, there are a few differences, as follows:

*'''No Tuck Rule''' - The [[Tuck rule (American football)|Tuck rule]] is one of the most controversial rules in the NFL. In the NFL, if a passer brings his arm forward in a passing motion and then loses possession of the ball as he is attempting to tuck it back toward his body, it's considered a forward pass (and thus an incomplete pass if the ball hits the ground). In the UFL, it would be called a fumble.
*'''Touchdown celebrations''' - Celebrations, individual or group, will only take place in the endzones and on the bench area.
*'''Fumbling out of the endzones'''- If the ball is fumbled out of the endzone, it will be placed back at the spot of the fumble, pending which team last had possession.
*'''Intentional grounding''' - A quarterback is allowed to intentionally ground the ball anywhere behind the line of scrimmage if he is under pressure.
*'''Instant replay''' - All reviews will be viewed upstairs by the replay official and he will only have 90 seconds for review.
*'''Overtime''' - Both teams will be guaranteed at least one possession. When a team scores, the other team will get a last chance to score on the next drive.
*'''Standardized uniforms''' - Unlike most other leagues, the UFL's four inaugural teams have uniforms with identical designs, with the only differences being the colors of the jerseys—black for New York, silver for Las Vegas (an homage to the team's home stadium, formerly known as the [[Silver Bowl]]), blue for Florida, green for California. The team's logo consists of a two-letter abbreviation indicating its home. As such, the league will not need to use separate "home and away" dark and light jerseys.

===United States Football League===
{{main|United States Football League}}

At first the USFL competed with the older, more established [[National Football League]] by following the [[David Dixon (businessman)|David Dixon]] plan and trying not to compete directly with it, primarily by playing its games on a March–June schedule but also having slightly different rules, most notably:
* The [[two-point conversion]] (since adopted by the NFL, in [[1994 NFL season|1994]]).
* The college rule of stopping the clock after first downs was used only for the final two minutes of each half.

====New United States Football League====
{{main|United States Football League (2010)}}

Like the [[XFL]], which adopted a number of unusual rules to drive fan curiosity, the USFL has announced the possibility of a number of new rules&lt;ref name="press"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mediasyndicate.com/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=10118 |title=The New United States Football League To Kick Off in February 2010 |date=2008-08-13 |work=New USFL Press Release (PDF) |accessdate=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (many of which were adopted from previous leagues):

* No pre-season, just a regular season (adopted from the [[World Football League]], although the WFL played a 20-week regular season)
* No touchbacks on kickoffs; if the ball goes out of the endzone, it will be placed at the 15-yard line (adopted from [[Arena Football League (1987–2008)|Arena Football League]])
* Field goals of 51 yards or more will be four points (adopted from [[NFL Europa|NFL Europe]])
* A three-point conversion will be placed at the 10-yard line (adopted from the XFL)
* One foot inbounds for a catch (a rule in virtually every league except the [[National Football League|NFL]])
* No kneel-downs (adopted from Arena Football League)
* Safeties are worth four points
* Overtime will be played like in college and the CFL

No word has been announced on whether the league will continue to follow the path of the XFL and adopt other rules like the [[motion (football)|forward motion]] rule used by the WFL, XFL and arena leagues, as well as in [[Canadian football]].

===World Football League===
{{main|World Football League}}
The WFL had several important rules differences from the [[National Football League]] of that era, and many were eventually adopted by the older league:
* Touchdowns were worth 7 points, instead of 6.
* Conversions were called "Action Points" and could '''only''' be scored via a run or pass play (as opposed to by kick as in other football leagues), and were worth one point. The ball was placed on the five-yard line for an Action Point. This rule was a revival of a 1968 preseason experiment by the NFL and [[American Football League]]. The [[XFL]] employed a similar rule 27 years later.
* Kickoffs were from the 30-yard line instead of the 40. Before 1974, NFL teams kicked off from the 40; from 1974 to 1993 &amp; since 2011, the NFL moved its kickoffs back to the 35, and from 1994 to 2010, the kickoff line was pushed back to the 30.
* Receivers needed only one foot in bounds for a legal pass reception, instead of two feet in the NFL then and now. College and high school football, the Arena Football League, and the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] have always used the one-foot rule.
* Bump-and-run pass coverage was outlawed once a receiver was 3 yards beyond the line of scrimmage. The NFL later adopted this rule, with a 5-yard bump zone.
* The goalposts were placed at the end line (the back of the end zone). At that time, college football goalposts were at the end line, but the NFL had its goalposts at the goal line from 1933 through 1973. Starting with the 1974 season, the NFL also moved its posts back to the end line.
* Missed field goals were returned to the line of scrimmage or the 20-yard line, whichever was farther from the goal line. The NFL also adopted this rule for its 1974 season, then replaced the line of scrimmage with the point of the kick in 1994.  Before this rule, missed field goals were (if unreturned) touchbacks, with the ball placed at the 20-yard line.  U.S. college football later adopted this rule, but left the point as the line of scrimmage rather than the point of the placement.
* A player in motion was allowed to move toward the line of scrimmage before the snap, as long as he was behind the line of scrimmage at the snap. This rule had never been used at any level of outdoor American football, but was (and still is) part of [[Canadian football]]. This rule is used in the Arena Football League and was used in the XFL.
* Punt returners were prohibited from using the fair catch, although the covering team could not come within 5 yards of the kick returner until he caught the ball. This rule also came from Canadian football, which still uses it, as does Arena football with kickoffs and missed field goals.  The XFL also used the so-called "halo rule".
* Penalties for offensive holding and ineligible receiver downfield were 10&amp;nbsp;yards, instead of 15. Several years later, these became 10-yard penalties at all levels of football. Still later, the ineligible receiver penalty was changed to 5&amp;nbsp;yards (with loss of down).
* The WFL's original overtime system was like nothing used in any form of American football before or since; it was more similar to the system long used in international [[Association football|soccer]]. Overtime in the regular season was one fixed 15-minute period, divided into two halves of 7½ minutes, each starting with a kickoff by one of the teams. The complete overtime was always played; there was no "sudden death" feature. In 1975, the WFL changed its overtime to the 15-minute sudden-death period, which the NFL adopted in 1974 and still uses today, albeit 5 minutes shorter since 2017.
* '''Limited (or no) pre-season games.'''  In 1974 and 1975, NFL teams played six pre-season games and 14 regular-season games (which was changed in 1978 to the current four pre-season and 16 regular-season games).  In contrast, the WFL's 1974 schedule called for 20 regular-season games and no pre-season games; in 1975, it was 18 regular-season games and two pre-season games.
* '''Summertime football.'''  The NFL's regular season started on September 15 in 1974 and on September 21 in 1975; the WFL's regular season started on July 10 in 1974 and on July 26 in 1975 (with the 1975 pre-season starting on July 5). The [[Canadian Football League]], which must contend with colder winters than American leagues, has always played during the summer with a similar schedule.
* '''Weeknight football''' (1974).  While NFL games were played mostly on Sundays and a game on [[Monday Night Football|Monday Night]], the WFL's 1974 schedule called for Wednesday night football (with a Thursday night national TV game). This scheduling format was abandoned in 1975. The featured Thursday night game was later adopted as "[[Run to the Playoffs|Thursday Night Football]]" by the NFL in 2006.
* '''The "Dickerod"'''. Instead of using a ten-yard chain strung between two sticks for measuring first down yardage, the WFL used a device called the "Dickerod," obstensibly named for its inventor. This was a single stick, roughly ten feet tall, mounted on a base which allowed it to pivot from side to side. The stick was swung down to ground level when a first down was being set, and a marker that slid along the shaft was fixed in place to line up with the nearest gridiron line (the major yard lines spaced every five yards). When that was set, the stick was swung back to the upright position. When a measurement was needed by the officials, the Dickerod was brought out to the ball position, the shaft swung down to ground level, the marker lined up with the nearest gridiron line, and the measurement was taken. (In all other forms of football today, a similar marker is clipped to the standard ten-yard chain, also lining up with a gridiron line.)

===World League of American Football===
{{main|World League of American Football}}
The WLAF played two seasons with 10 teams in the spring of 1991 and 1992, with the [[World Bowl]] as championship games. Rules unique to WLAF included assigning increasing point value to field goals based on distance, and a requirement that at least one player of non-US nationality participate in at least every other series of downs.

New ideas were successfully tested, like using the [[two-point conversion]] rule also on the professional field before adopting it in the NFL in [[1994 NFL season|1994]]. Other minor tweaks in gameplay, such as a shorter kickoff tee, were also first used in the WLAF.

===XFL===
{{main|XFL}}
Despite boasts by [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]] promoters of a "rules-light" game and universally negative reviews from the mainstream sports media early on, the XFL played a brand of 11-man outdoor football that was recognizable, aside from the opening game sprint to determine possession and some other changes, some modified during the season. In fact, most of the rule changes were inherited from the 1970s [[World Football League]].

====Grass stadiums====
All XFL teams had to play in outdoor stadiums with grass surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xflboard.com/stadiums/index.htm List of stadiums] courtesy of xflboard.com.&lt;/ref&gt; No domed stadiums, artificial turf stadiums, or [[retractable roof]] stadiums were allowed. (This happened to occur during [[Giants Stadium]]'s brief experiment with natural grass; the stadium's turf did not hold up well in the winter and early spring weather and the stadium reverted to its traditional artificial turf in 2003.)

====Opening scramble====
Replacing the [[coin toss]] at the beginning of each game was an event in which one player from each team sought to recover a football 20 yards away in order to determine possession. Both players lined up side-by-side on one of the 30-yard lines, with the ball being placed at the 50-yard line. At the whistle, the two players would run toward the ball and attempt to gain possession; whichever player gained possession first was allowed to choose possession (as if he had won a coin toss in other leagues). The scramble led to the first XFL injury: [[Orlando Rage]] free safety [[Hassan Shamsid-Deen]] separated his shoulder in the scramble during the XFL's opening weekend. This injury would keep Shamsid-Deen out for the rest of the season.

====No PAT (point after touchdown) kicks====
After [[touchdown]]s there were no extra point kicks, due to the XFL's perception that an extra point kick was a "guaranteed point." To earn a point after a touchdown, teams ran a single offensive down from the two-yard line (functionally identical to the NFL/NCAA/CFL [[two-point conversion]]), but for just a single point. By the playoffs, two-point and three-point conversions had been added to the rules. Teams could opt for the bonus points by playing the conversion farther back from the goal line.

This rule, as originally implemented, was similar to the [[World Football League|WFL]]'s "Action Point," and was identical to a 1968 experiment by the [[National Football League|NFL]] and [[American Football League]], used only in preseason interleague games that year.

====Overtime====
Ties were resolved in similar fashion to the NCAA and present-day CFL game, with at least one possession by each team, starting from the opponent's 20-yard line. There were differences: there were no first downs &amp;ndash; teams had to score within four downs, and the team that had possession first in overtime could not attempt a field goal until fourth down. If that team managed to score a touchdown in fewer than four downs, the second team would only have that same number of downs to match or beat the result. If the score was still tied after one overtime period, the team that played second on offense in the first OT would start on offense in the second OT.

====Bump and Run====
The XFL allowed full [[bump and run coverage]] early in the season. Defensive backs were allowed to hit wide receivers any time before the quarterback released the ball, as long as the hit came from the front or the side (similar to the NCAA). In an effort to increase offensive production, bump and run was restricted to the first five yards from the line of scrimmage (similar to NFL) following the fourth week of the season.

====Forward Motion====
Unlike the [[National Football League|NFL]], but like the [[World Football League]] and Arena football before it, the XFL allowed one offensive player to move toward the line of scrimmage once he was outside the tackles.

====Halo rule / Live punts====
The heavily hyped "no [[fair catch]]" rule (announcers tended to mention it on almost every punt/kickoff) was paired with a five-yard zone excluding players of the kicking team around potential returners before the ball touched them or the ground, similar to rules in [[Canadian football]], [[rugby football]], and contemporary NCAA rules (where the term "halo" was applied, though the XFL called it instead the "danger zone"). But instead of making punt returns more exciting, it often had the opposite effect, since the XFL players' inexperience with the rule caused a high number of game-delaying penalties.

The [[fair catch]] had previously been abolished from Canadian rules, NCAA rules (but only for the 1950 season), and [[Rugby League]].

Another difference was that after touching ground 25 yards or more beyond the line of scrimmage, punts could be recovered and advanced by all players of the kicking team.  This led to more [[quick kick]]s being taken on third-down-and-long situations in the one season of the small league than had been seen in the NFL over several preceding decades of longer seasons.  XFL's "innovation" was similar to a rule that had been in effect in American football in the 1910s and part of the 1920s.

XFL penalized 10 yards from the succeeding spot punts going out of bounds, even if they first touched the ground (but not a player of the receiving team).

For the initial weeks of the season, the XFL forbade all players on the kicking team from going downfield before a kick was made from scrimmage on that down, similarly to a rule the NFL considered in 1974. For the rest of the season the XFL modified it to allow one player closest to each sideline downfield ahead of the kick, the same modification the NFL adopted to their change just before their 1974 exhibition games started.

The purpose of these provisions was to keep play going after the ball was punted, encouraging the kicking team to make the ball playable and the receiving team to run it back.

====Roster and salaries====
The XFL limited each team to an unusually low 38 players (roughly analogous to the 42 for CFL rosters, as opposed to 53 on NFL teams and 80 or more on unlimited college rosters). This resulted, most commonly, in each team only carrying two quarterbacks and one kicker, who doubled as the punter.

The XFL paid standardized player salaries. [[Quarterback]]s earned [[United States dollar|U.S. $]]5,000 per week, kickers earned $3,500, and all other uniformed players earned $4,500 per week, though a few players got around these restrictions ([[Los Angeles Xtreme]] players [[Noel Prefontaine]], the league's lone punting specialist, and [[Matt Malloy]], a wide receiver) by having themselves listed as backup quarterbacks. Players on a winning team received a bonus of $2,500 for the week, $7,500 for winning a playoff game. The team that won the championship game split $1,000,000 (roughly $25,000 per player). Furthermore, players did not receive any fringe benefits, meaning players had to pay for their own health insurance.

==Video games==

===''Blitz'' series===
{{main|NFL Blitz|Blitz: The League}}

In 1997, seven players were on the field per side (as opposed to eleven). Not only were there fewer players, but positions were flexible. [[Wide receivers]] could run the ball and sometimes pass and [[defensive team|defensive players]] were all crosses between [[pass rusher]]s and [[defensive back]]s. 2002 saw an increase to eight players and ''NFL Blitz Pro'' (released in 2003) increased to eleven.

Unlike the NFL, pass interference was allowed, as were late hits, showboating and excessive celebrations.

There were no timeouts, but the clock stopped after every play, and extra points after touchdowns were claimed to be automatic, unless it is chosen to go for two points. However, although rare, choosing an automatic extra point can sometimes result in the extra point being missed if the kicking team is winning by a wide margin.

Quarters were shortened to two minutes (default setting) with a faster running timer than real time. For most releases, a first down meant you would have to go 30 yards, instead of ten yards.

==Women's football==
{{main|Women's American football}}

===National Women's Football Association===
{{main|National Women's Football Association}}

NWFA teams play according to standard [[National Football League]] rules with the following notable exceptions:

* TDY-sized football
* only one foot in-bounds is required for a reception
* no blocking below the waist downfield

===Legends Football League===
Play style is full-contact. Uniforms consist of helmets, shoulder pads, elbow pads, knee pads, sports bras, and shorts.

There are no [[Kickoff (gridiron football)|kickoffs]] nor field goals, punts are allowed if inside their own 10-yard line; halves and after scores begin on their own 15-yard line.&lt;ref name=Philly&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/video/52018692.html|title= Lingerie football}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team must attempt to get a first down on every fourth down. After a touchdown, a team can attempt a one-point conversion from the one-yard line, or a two-point conversion from the three-yard line. The defending team can run the ball toward their end zone for 2 points off conversion attempts; offending team can get 1 point if safety is scored off conversion attempts.

There are seven women on each side of the 50-yard field, one player less than in [[arena football]]. Teams consist of 18 players, of which 12 are active on game day. This means at least 3 or 4 players play both ways, as "iron women". But coaches are allowed [[free substitution]].

The standard offensive formation features 1 [[quarterback]], 2 [[running back]]s, 1 [[Center (American football)|center]], and 3 [[wide receiver]]s. The standard defensive formation features 2 [[Lineman (American football)#Defensive line|defensive linewomen]], 2 [[linebacker]]s, 2 [[cornerback]]s, and 1 [[Safety (American football position)|safety]].

The field is 50-yard between end zones, 30 yards wide, and the end zones are 8 yards deep.&lt;ref name=News14&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.news14.com/content/sports/608720/lingerie-football-coming-to-charlotte-in-2010/Default.aspx|title= Lingerie football coming to Charlotte in 2010|accessdate= 2009-05-05|date= 2009-05-04|publisher= News 14 Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A game consists of four 10-minute periods, separated by a 12-minute halftime (30-minute halftime in championship). In the event of a tie, an 8-minute sudden-death overtime is played; whoever scores first wins it; otherwise, the game ends drawn &amp; teams get a tie (half-victory/half-loss) in standings; however, in postseason, multiple 10-minute overtime periods are played until one team scores, which wins the game. Teams get 2 timeouts per half or overtime period.

Targeting players, such as using the helmet to ram opponents, is prohibited; they risk immediate disqualification plus a 15-yard penalty if they do.

{{Merge to|Pick-up sticks|date=December 2017}}
[[File:Mikado.jpg|thumb|People playing Mikado]]

'''Mikado''' is a [[pick-up sticks]] game originating in [[Europe]], played with a set of same-length sticks which can measure between {{convert|17|cm}} and {{convert|50|cm}}.

In 1936, it was brought from [[Hungary]] (where it was called '''Marokko''') to the [[United States]] and named '''pick-up sticks'''. This term is not very specific in respect to existing stick game variations. The "Mikado" name may have been avoided because it was a brand name of a game producer. The game is named for the highest scoring (blue) stick "[[Emperor of Japan|Mikado]]" ([[Emperor of Japan]]). 

== Rules ==
[[File:Spiel Mikado.jpg|thumb|Mikado sticks]]

Classic Mikado consists of 41 sticks. They are coded with different values that have a total of 170 points and are around 15&amp;nbsp;cm long.

The sticks are bundled and taken in one hand that touches the table or ground. The release creates a circular jumble. Now the players take turns, in which one stick after another should be taken up without moving or touching others. The take-away could be by hand, possibly through pressing on a stick's tip or if one has already picked up a special stick (Mikado/Mandarin), it could be used as a helper, possibly to throw up another stick.

On a fault the turn ends (the last stick taken is not counted). The next player bundles and drops the sticks again. After several rounds, normally five, the one with the highest score – the total of the values of the sticks picked up – is the winner.

A player is allowed to stand up on but not to leave their own place. A bad throw could be rerun and the rules should be kept strict in respect to moving sticks to enjoy the game.

== Rule variations ==

On a player's turn:
*the sticks are rebundled and dropped again (traditional);
*the stack is taken over as is from the previous player (casual);
*the person to the left of the player turn rebundles and drops the sticks for the player, thus eliminating the potential for a doctored drop.

Sticks allowed as pick-up helpers:
*Mikado (traditional);
*only the Mikado if the player has at least one of all other sticks (Kuli, Samurai, Bonzen, Mandarin);
*Mikado / Mandarin (simplified);
*Mikado / Mandarin / Bonzen (casual);
*any stick already picked up (very casual).

A stick taken when picking it up makes another stick in the stack move:
*is not added to the player's score and dropped back (stack take-over variant);
*is not added (traditional);
*is added to the player's score.

Scoring:
*the exact sequence of Kuli, Samurai, Bonzen and Mandarin may double the points of a turn;
*a player who does not use the correct helper may lose all points of the current turn.

== Types ==

'''Obstructing the field''' is one of the nine methods of [[dismissal (cricket)|dismissing]] a [[batsman]] in the sport of [[cricket]]. It dictates that either batsman can be given out if he wilfully attempts to obstruct or distract the [[Fielding (cricket)|fielding side]] by word or action. It is governed by Law 37 of the [[laws of cricket]], and is a rare way for a batsman to be dismissed: in the history of cricket, there have been only one instance in [[Test cricket|Test matches]], six occasions in [[One Day International]] (ODI) games, and only one instance in [[Twenty20]] International matches. However, there have also been seven instances in Test cricket, and two in ODIs, where a batsman has been dismissed [[handled the ball]], a mode of dismissal now folded into obstructing the field. In most cases an obstruction occurs when a batsman thinks that he is going to be [[Run out (cricket)|run out]] and he blocks the ball with his bat or changes his course while [[running between wickets]] to block the ball. The obstruction has to be deliberate, so a batsman will not be out if the contact with the ball is inadvertent.

The only time a batsman has been dismissed obstructing the ball in a Test match was during the [[South African cricket team in England in 1951|South African cricket team's tour of England in 1951]] when, in the fifth Test, England's [[Leonard Hutton]] [[Glossary of cricket terms#T|top edged]] the ball and, thinking the ball would hit the stumps, attempted to hit the ball away, thereby preventing the [[wicket-keeper]] from [[Catch (cricket)|catching]] the ball.

==Definition==
Obstructing the field is Law 37 in the [[Laws of cricket]] established by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC). A batsman can be given out for obstructing the field if he wilfully attempts to obstruct or distract the fielding side by word or action.&lt;ref name="mcc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-37-obstructing-the-field/ |title=Law 37 – Obstructing the field |publisher=MCC |accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law 37 describes the following three circumstances where this applies (but the law is not limited to these circumstances):
*If, in the act of playing the ball, the batsmen wilfully strikes the ball with a hand not holding the bat, unless this is to avoid injury.{{efn|This situation was previously covered in a separate Law:[[Handled the ball]].}}

*If either batsman should wilfully obstruct or distract a fielder preventing a catch being made.
*If, at any time while the ball is in play and without the consent of a fielder, he uses his bat or any part of his person, to return the ball to any fielder.
The latter situation is rarely applied, as the fielding side generally accept that the batsman is being helpful in returning the ball. A bowler does not receive credit for the wicket when a batsman is dismissed in this fashion, and any runs that have been completed before the offence is committed are scored (unless the obstruction prevents a catch being made{{efn|In this case any penalty runs will stand.&lt;ref name="mcc"/&gt;}}).

==Earliest recorded instance==
The first known instance of a player being dismissed in a manner equivalent to the modern term 'Obstructing the field' occurred in a minor match at Sheffield on 27 August 1792, between [[Sheffield Cricket Club]] and Bents Green. The Bents Green player John Shaw, who scored 7 in the first innings, had his dismissal recorded as "run out of the ground to hinder a catch". The information was recorded by [[G. B. Buckley]] who found it in the ''Sheffield Advertiser'' dated 31 August 1792. Sheffield won by 10 wickets in a match that was notable for two other reasons, these being that it was the first match played in [[Yorkshire]] for which full scores are recorded and it was the earliest known instance of a three innings match.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, pp.27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dismissals in international cricket==
[[Len Hutton]] is the only man given out this way in Test cricket, for an incident that occurred at [[The Oval]] during the fifth Test of South Africa's tour of England in 1951.

In [[One Day International]]s, [[Rameez Raja]] (for Pakistan against England at Karachi in 1987) was given out for hitting the ball away with his bat to avoid being run out going for his century off the last ball of the innings, and [[Mohinder Amarnath]] (for India against Sri Lanka at Ahmedabad in 1989) was given out for kicking the ball away to avoid being run out. Another batsman to be given out this way is [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]] of [[Pakistan]] in the first ODI of [[India]] vs [[Pakistan]] Hutch Cup on 6 February 2006. After Inzamam drove the ball to mid off, Indian [[Suresh Raina]] threw it back to the striker's end, Inzamam stopping it with his bat. Umpire [[Simon Taufel]] gave him out as he was in the line of the stumps and out of his crease (and thus would have been run out had the ball hit the stumps).

[[Mohammad Hafeez]] of Pakistan was dismissed obstructing the field on 21 March 2013 in the 4th ODI of the bilateral series match against South Africa. He became the first man to be given out obstructing the field after the new playing conditions were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/south-africa-v-pakistan-2013/engine/current/match/567371.html]&lt;/ref&gt; His teammate, [[Anwar Ali (cricketer born 1987)|Anwar Ali]], was dismissed obstructing the field on 27 November 2013 in the second ODI against South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/south-africa-v-pakistan-2013-14/content/player/232491.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Stokes]] of England was dismissed obstructing the field on 5 September 2015 in the second ODI against Australia for stopping the ball with his hand when the bowler, Mitchell Starc, had thrown the ball in an attempt to run him out.&lt;ref&gt;http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283167.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June 2017, in a Twenty20 match against South Africa, [[Jason Roy]] of England was given out obstructing the field, for changing the side of the pitch he was running on when returning from backing up. This caused the returned ball to hit him when he was out of his crease, when it could conceivably have hit the stumps. The South African fielders immediately appealed for a dismissal. Responding to this, the on-field umpires called the ball dead and referred the decision to the third umpire, who gave Roy out.&lt;ref name="Roy"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england-v-south-africa-2017/engine/match/1031433.html|title= England vs South Africa T20I scorecard|work=ESPNCricinfo}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sydney Swans''' is a professional [[Australian rules football]] club which plays in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL). Established in [[Melbourne]] as the '''South Melbourne Football Club''' in 1874, the Swans relocated to [[Sydney]] in 1982, thus making it the first club in the competition to be based outside [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

Initially playing in the [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] (VFA), the Swans joined seven other clubs in founding the breakaway Victorian Football League (now known as the AFL) in 1896. It won premierships in [[1909 VFL Grand Final|1909]], [[1918 VFL Grand Final|1918]] and [[1933 VFL Grand Final|1933]] before experiencing a 72-year premiership drought—the longest in the competition's history. The club broke the drought in [[2005 AFL Grand Final|2005]] and won another premiership in [[2012 AFL season|2012]]. The club has proven to be one of the most consistent teams in the nationalised AFL, failing to make the finals in only three seasons since [[1995 AFL season|1995]], playing the most number of finals matches and winning the second-most matches overall (only behind {{AFL Gee}}) since 2000 and boasting a finals winning record of over 50% in the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uKBlqPdAo0WO-F_PQzFLuRX-TDz7xsg7TFb-gQ1C3F0/pubhtml?gid=388289766&amp;single=true|title=AFL Finals Summary All Clubs 2000–2015|accessdate=9 November 2015|publication-place=Google Docs|first=Justin|last=Mitchell|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2017-02-06/which-was-the-best-club-since-2000|title=Which was the best club since 2000?|work=Staff writers|publisher=Australian Football League|date=6 February 2017|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inauguration date of the club is officially 19 June 1874, and it adopted the name "South Melbourne Football Club" four weeks later, on 15 July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sydneyswans.com.au/Swans/TheClub/History/tabid/7210/Default.aspx History – Official AFL Website of the Sydney Swans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901004841/http://sydneyswans.com.au/Swans/TheClub/History/tabid/7210/Default.aspx |date=1 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, South Melbourne amalgamated with the nearby [[Albert Park Football Club (VFA)|Albert-park Football Club]], which had a senior football history dating back to May 1867 (Albert-park had, in fact, been known as South Melbourne during its first year of existence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|page=5|title=Thursday, 23 May 1867|date=23 May 1867|publication-place=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Australasian|pages=588–589|title=Football|date=8 May 1869|volume=VI|issue=162|publication-place=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the amalgamation, the club retained the name South Melbourne, and adopted the club's now familiar red and white colours from Albert-park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vuir.vu.edu.au/344/1/05chapter4.pdf|title=Chapter four – Sydney or bust: the South Melbourne Football Club's 1981 relocation saga|accessdate=18 October 2014|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicknamed the "Southerners", the team was more colourfully known as the "Bloods", in reference to the bright red sash on their white jumpers&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.vicnet.net.au/~nickname/afl.html#swans Nickname – AFL&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608065725/http://home.vicnet.net.au/~nickname/afl.html |date=8 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edited by Ross, J and G. Hutchison, G.,''100 Years of Australian Football'', Published by Viking, Penguin Books Australia Ltd, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; (the sash was replaced with a red "V" in 1932).&lt;ref&gt;Branagan, Mark and Lefebvre, Mike, Bloodstained Angels, The Rise &amp; Fall of the Foreign Legion, 1995, self-published, Melbourne, Australia&lt;/ref&gt; The colorful epithet the "Bloodstained Angels" was also in use. The club was based at [[Lake Oval]], also home of the [[South Melbourne Cricket Club]].

===VFA era: 1877–1896===
South Melbourne was a junior foundation club of the [[Victorian Football Association]] in 1877, and attained senior status in 1879;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Australasian|date=18 October 1879|title=The Football Season of 1879 – Part 1|author=Peter Pindar|publication-place=Melbourne|page=493|issue=707|volume=XXVII}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South Melbourne amalgamation with neighbouring [[Albert Park Football Club (VFA)|Albert-park Football Club]] in 1880, formed a club that became the strongest in metropolitan Melbourne.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Australasian|date=16 October 1880|title=The Football Season of 1880|author=Peter Pindar|publication-place=Melbourne|page=492|issue=759|volume=XXIX}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over its first decade as an amalgamated club, South Melbourne won five VFA premierships – in 1881, 1885 (undefeated), and three-in-a-row in 1888, 1889 and 1890 – and was runner-up to the provincial [[Geelong Football Club]] in 1880, 1883 and 1886.

At the end of the 1896 season, [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] and South Melbourne finished equal at the top of the VFA's premiership ladder with records of 14–3–1, requiring a [[1896 VFA season#Playoff match|playoff match]] to determine the season's premiership; this was the first time this had occurred in VFA history.&lt;ref name="rd20"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne|date=28 September 1896|title=Football Notes|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match took place on 3 October 1896 at the [[East Melbourne Cricket Ground]]. Collingwood won the match, six goals to five, in front of an estimated crowd of 12,000.&lt;ref name="argusplayoff"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne|date=5 October 1896|title=The Football Premiership|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This grand final would be the last match South Melbourne would play in the VFA, as the following season they would be one of eight founding clubs forming the breakaway [[Victorian Football League (1897–1989)|Victorian Football League]]. The other clubs were [[St Kilda Football Club]], [[Essendon Football Club]], [[Fitzroy Football Club]], [[Melbourne Football Club]], [[Geelong Football Club]], [[Carlton Football Club]] and [[Collingwood Football Club]].

===VFL entry: 1897–1909===
South Melbourne was one of the original founding clubs of the [[Victorian Football League (1897–1989)|Victorian Football League]] that was formed in 1897.

===Premiership success: 1909–1945===
The club had early success and won three VFL premierships in 1909, 1918 and 1933. The club was at its most successful in the 1930s, when key recruits from both Victoria and interstate led to a string of appearances in the finals, including four successive grand final appearances from 1933 to 1936, albeit with only one premiership in 1933.  The collection of players recruited from interstate in 1932/1933 became known as South Melbourne's "Foreign Legion".&lt;ref&gt;The caricature at the foot of [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/149547747/17704724 page 10 of ''Table Talk'' (22 June 1933)] was created by Richard "Dick" Ovenden (1897–1972). From left to right those represented are: [[Jack Bisset]], the team's captain; [[Dick Mullaly]], the club's secretary; [[Brighton Diggins]], from Subiaco (WAFL); [[Bert Beard]], from South Fremantle (WAFL); [[Bill Faul]], from Subiaco (WAFL); [[Jim O'Meara]], from East Perth (WAFL); [[Frank Davies (footballer, born 1907)|Frank Davies]], from City (NTFA); [[Laurie Nash]], from City (NTFA); [[John Bowe (footballer)|John Bowe]], from Subiaco (WAFL); [[Jack Wade (footballer)|Jack Wade]], from Port Adelaide (SANFL); [[Ossie Bertram]], from West Torrens (SANFL); and [[Wilbur Harris]], from West Torrens (SANFL).&lt;/ref&gt;

On grand final eve, 1935, as the Swans prepared to take on Collingwood, star full-forward Bob Pratt was clipped by a truck moments after stepping off a tram and subsequently missed the match for South. Ironically, the truck driver was a South Melbourne supporter.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, I.W. (2006) ''The Bloodbath''. Scribe Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this period that the team became known as the Swans. The nickname, which was suggested by a [[Herald and Weekly Times]] artist in 1933, was inspired by the number of Western Australians in the team (the [[black swan]] being the state emblem of Western Australia), and was formally adopted by the club before the following season 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Sporting Globe|date=24 January 1934|publication-place=Melbourne|title=Real story behind South Melbourne's football premiership|page=7|author=J. M. Rohan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name stuck, in part due to the club's association with nearby [[Albert Park and Lake]], also known for its [[swan]]s (although there are no longer any non-native white swans and only black, indigenous swans in the lake).

After several years with only limited success, South Melbourne next reached the grand final in 1945. The match, played against Carlton, was to become known as "the Bloodbath", courtesy of the brawl that overshadowed the match, with a total of 9 players being reported by the umpires. Carlton won the match by 28 points, and from then on, South Melbourne struggled.

===Struggling times: 1946–1981===
In the following years, South Melbourne consistently struggled, as their traditional inner-city recruiting district largely emptied as a result of demographic shifts. The club missed the finals in 1946 and continued to fall such that by 1950 they were second-last on the ladder. They nearly made the finals in 1952, but from 1953 to 1969, they never finished higher than eighth on the ladder. By the 1960s it was clear that South Melbourne's financial resources would not be capable of allowing them to compete in the growing market for country and interstate players, and their own local zone was never strong enough to compensate for this. The introduction of country [[zoning (Australian rules football)|zoning]] failed to help, as the [[Riverina Football League]] proved to be one of the least profitable zones.

Between 1945 and 1981, South Melbourne made the finals only twice: under legendary coach [[Norm Smith]], South Melbourne finished fourth in 1970, but lost the first semi-final; and, in 1977, the club finished fifth under coach Ian Stewart, but lost the elimination final. In that time, they "won" three [[Wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoons]]. Between Round 7, 1972 and Round 13, 1973, the team lost 29 consecutive games. By the end of the 1970s South Melbourne were saddled with massive debts after struggling for such a long period of time.

==Sydney history==
{{recentism|date=December 2011}}

===Early years in Sydney: 1982–1987===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the VFL was strategically interested in seeing a club based in Sydney, as part of a long-term plan to broaden the appeal of the game in [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]]. The league had started moving a few premiership matches to the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] annually since 1979, and in 1981 was preparing to establish an entirely new, 13th VFL club in Sydney after the [[Fitzroy Lions]] staved off a proposed relocation to become the Sydney Lions in late 1980. These plans halted when the South Melbourne board, recognising the difficulties it faced with viability and financial stability in Melbourne, made the decision to play all 1982 home games in Sydney. On 29 July 1981, the VFL formally accepted the proposal, and paved the way for the Swans to shift to Sydney in 1982.

The move caused great internal difficulties, as a group of supporters known as Keep South at South campaigned throughout the rest of 1981 to stop the move; and, at an [[extraordinary general meeting]] on 22 September, the group democratically took control of the club's board. However, the new board did not have the power to unilaterally stop the move to Sydney: under the VFL constitution, to rescind the decision that had been made on 29 July required a three-quarters majority in a vote of all twelve clubs, and at a meeting on 14 October it failed to obtain this majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|publication-place=Melbourne|title=VFL 'no' sends South to Sydney|author=Mike Coward|date=15 October 1981|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new board also lacked the support of the players, the vast majority of whom were in favour of a long-term move to Sydney; in early November, after the board promised that it would try to bring the club back to Melbourne in 1983, the players went on strike, seeking to force the new board commit to Sydney in the long term as well as seeking payments that the cash-strapped club owed them from the previous season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|publication-place=Melbourne|page=40|author=Geoff Slattery|date=7 November 1981|title=South Players on strike}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board ended up undermining its own position when it accepted a $400,000 loan from the VFL in late November to stay solvent, under the condition that it commit to Sydney for two years. Finally, in early December, the Keep South at South board resigned and a board in favour of the move to Sydney was installed.&lt;ref name="saga"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Roar|title=Revisiting the South Melbourne to Sydney saga|date=6 July 2012|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2012/07/06/the-south-to-sydney-saga/|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon moving, the club played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In 1982, the club was technically a Melbourne-based club which played all of its home games in Sydney; it dropped the name "South Melbourne" in June 1982, becoming known as simply "the Swans" for the rest of that season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne|first=Peter|last=Simunovich|title=The Swans – officially|date=3 June 1982|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1983 that the club formally moved its operations to Sydney and became the Sydney Swans.&lt;ref name="saga" /&gt; Its physical "home club" was the "Southern Cross Social Club" at 120a Clovelly Road, Randwick, New South Wales which became bankrupt in 1987; new Sydney Swans Offices were then set up in the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].

[[File:Sydney80s.png|frame|left|Sydney 1980s shield logo]]

On 31 July 1985, for what was thought to be [[Australian dollar|$]]6.3&amp;nbsp;million, [[Geoffrey Edelsten]] "bought" the Swans; in reality it was $2.9&amp;nbsp;million in cash with funding and other payments spread over five years. Edelsten resigned as chairman in less than twelve months, but had already made his mark. He immediately recruited former Geelong coach [[Tom Hafey]]. Hafey, in turn, used his knowledge of Geelong's contracts to recruit [[David Bolton (Australian footballer)|David Bolton]], [[Bernard Toohey]] and [[Greg Williams (Australian footballer)|Greg Williams]], who would all form a key part of the Sydney side, at a league-determined total fee of $240,000 (less than the $500,000 Geelong demanded and even the $300,000 Sydney offered).&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Greg: ''Diesel: The Greg Williams Story'', page 91. Pan MacMillan Australia, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The likes of [[Gerard Healy]], [[Merv Neagle]] and [[Paul Morwood]] were also poached from other clubs, and failed approaches were made to [[Simon Madden]], [[Terry Daniher]], [[Andrew Bews]] and [[Maurice Rioli]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Greg: ''Diesel: The Greg Williams Story'', p. 93. Pan MacMillan Australia, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Edelsten years, the Swans were seen by the Sydney public as a flamboyant club, typified by the style of its spearhead, [[Warwick Capper]], his long bright blond [[mullet (hairstyle)|mullet]] and bright pink boots made him unmissable on the field and his pink Lamborghini, penchant for fashion models and eccentricity made him notorious off the field – all somewhat [[1980s in fashion|fashionable in the 1980s]]. During Capper's peak years, the Swans had made successive finals appearances for the first time since relocating. His consistently spectacular aerial exploits earned him consecutive [[Mark of the Year]] awards while his goalkicking efforts (amassing 103 goals in 1987) made him runner up in the Coleman Medal two years running. The Swans’ successive finals appearances saw crowds during this time peak at an average of around 25,000 per game. Edelsten also introduced the "Swanettes", becoming the sole such cheerleading group among VFL teams following the disbandment of Carlton's Blue Birds in 1986. The Swanettes did not get much performance time, owing to the short intervals between quarters of play in the VFL and the lack of space in which they might perform while other activities take place on the field. The Swanettes were soon discontinued and no club has had cheerleaders since then.

In 1987, the Swans scored 201 points against the [[West Coast Eagles]] and the following week scored 236 points against the [[Essendon Football Club]]. Both games were at the SCG. The Swans remain one of only two clubs to have scored consecutive team tallies above 200 points, the only other being Geelong in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[[1992 AFL season]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was followed by several heavy losses, including defeat by Hawthorn by 99 points in the Qualifying Final and by 76 points against Melbourne in the First Semi-final.

===Dark times: 1988–1994===
The club's form was to slump in the following year.

Losses were in the millions. A group of financial backers including [[Mike Willessee]], Basil Sellers, Peter Weinert and Craig Kimberley purchased the licence and bankrolled the club until 1993, when the AFL stepped in.

Morale at the side plummeted as players were asked to take pay cuts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Main]], ''Aussie rules for dummies'' (2nd edition, 2008), p.128&lt;/ref&gt; Legendary coach [[Tom Hafey]] was sacked by the club in 1988 after a player-led rebellion at his tough training methods (unusual in the semi-professional days of that era).

Capper was sold to the Brisbane Bears for $400,000 in a desperate attempt to improve the club's finances. Instead, it only led to disastrous on-field performances. Instead of a 100-goal-a-season forward, Sydney's goalkicking was led by [[Bernard Toohey]] (usually a defender) with 29 in 1989, then Jim West with 34 in 1990. Players left the club in droves, including Brownlow Medalist [[Greg Williams (Australian footballer)|Greg Williams]], [[Bernard Toohey]] and [[Barry Mitchell (footballer)|Barry Mitchell]]. The careers of stars such as [[Dennis Carroll]], [[David Bolton (Australian footballer)|David Bolton]], [[Ian Roberts (footballer)|Ian Roberts]], [[Tony Morwood]] and [[David Murphy (Australian rules footballer)|David Murphy]] wound down,&lt;ref&gt;Cowley, Michael (19 October 2009) [http://www.smh.com.au/afl/afl-news/gen-next-must-fly-for-swans-as-wily-old-birds-go-20091124-j2aa.html Gen Next must fly for Swans as wily old birds go]&lt;/ref&gt; while promising young players like [[Jamie Lawson (Australian footballer)|Jamie Lawson]], [[Robert Teal]] and [[Paul Bryce]] had their careers cut short by injury.

Attendances consistently dropped below 10,000 when the team performed poorly between 1990 and 1994. The nadir came with three consecutive wooden spoons in 1992, 1993 and 1994.

The AFL stepped in to save the Swans, offering substantial monetary and management support. The club survived, despite strong rumours in 1992 that it would merge with the [[Brisbane Bears]] to form a combined New South Wales/Queensland team, fold altogether, or even move back to South Melbourne.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} With draft and salary cap concessions in the early 1990s and a series of notable recruits, the team became competitive after the early part of the decade.

During this time, the side was largely held together by two inspirational skippers, both from the [[Wagga Wagga]] region of country New South Wales, [[Dennis Carroll]] and later the courageous captain [[Paul Kelly (footballer)|Paul Kelly]].

Desperate to hang on, the club was keen to enlist the biggest names and identities in the AFL, and recruited legendary coach [[Ron Barassi]] who helped save the club from extinction while serving them as coach from Round 7, 1993 to 1995. At roughly the same time, Hawthorn legend [[Dermott Brereton]] was also recruited, albeit with little on-field impact. On a much brighter side for the Swans, their captain Paul Kelly won the League's highest individual honour, the [[Brownlow Medal]], in 1995.

===Tony Lockett and grand final return: 1995–2001===
A big coup for the club was recruitment of [[St Kilda Football Club]] champion [[Tony Lockett|Tony "Plugger" Lockett]] in 1995. Lockett became a cult figure in Sydney, with an instant impact and along with the [[Super League war]] in the dominant rival [[rugby league]] football code in Australia, helped the Swans to become a powerhouse Sydney icon.

1995 would be Barassi's last year in charge. The Swans won eight games – as many as they did in the previous three seasons combined – and finished with a percentage of over 100 (in fact, they have managed such consistently ever since). They were also one of only two teams to defeat the all-conquering Carlton side of that year. Swans great Paul Kelly also won the [[Brownlow Medal]] that year. Barassi left an improving team, a club in a much better state than he found them.

Former Hawthorn player Rodney Eade took over the reins in 1996 and after a slow start (they lost their first two games of the season), turned the club around into powerful force. The Swans ended the minor round on top of the premiership table with 16 wins, 5 losses, and 1 draw. In the finals, the Swans won one of the most thrilling AFL preliminary finals in history after Plugger Lockett kicked a behind after the siren to win the game. The Swans lost the grand final to {{AFL Nor}}, which had been their first appearance in a grand final since 1945. The game was played in front of 93,102 at the [[MCG]].

The Swans then made the finals for four of the next five full years that Rodney Eade was in charge. In 1998 they finished 3rd on the AFL ladder; despite beating {{AFL StK}} in their first final the Swans were then beaten by eventual premiers {{AFL Ade}} in the semi-final at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground|SCG]].

The 1999 season was a largely uneventful year for the club, the only real highlight being [[Tony Lockett]] kicking his record-breaking 1300th goal against {{AFL Col}} in Round 10. The 1999 season ended with a 69-point mauling at the hands of minor premiers {{AFL Ess}}.

After missing the finals in [[2000 AFL season|2000]], the Swans rebounded to finish 7th in [[2001 AFL season|2001]], but were beaten by {{AFL Haw}} by 55 points in their elimination final at [[Colonial Stadium]].

===Rebuilding and finals return: 2002–2004===
Former Swans favourite son [[Paul Roos (footballer)|Paul Roos]] was appointed caretaker coach midway through the 2002 season, replacing Rodney Eade who was removed after Round 12. Roos won six of the remaining 10 games that year (including the last four of the season) and was installed as the permanent coach from the 2003 season onwards, despite rumors that Sydney had nearly concluded a deal with [[Terry Wallace]].

Roos continued a record as a successful coach with the Swans for the eight full seasons that would follow.

A new home ground in [[ANZ Stadium]] (then known as Telstra Stadium) provided increased capacity over the SCG. The Swans' first game played at the Stadium in Round 9, 2002 against {{AFL Ess}} attracted 54,169 spectators. The Sydney Swans v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] match on 23 August 2003 set an attendance record for the largest crowd to watch an AFL game outside of Victoria with an official attendance of 72,393 and was the largest home and away AFL crowd at any stadium for 2003. A preliminary final against the [[Brisbane Lions]] in 2003 attracted 71,019 people. The Swans lost all three of those significant matches.

2004 saw an average year for Sydney, however one highlight was when they ended {{AFL StK}}'s undefeated start to the season in Round 11. The match was notable for [[Leo Barry]]'s effort in nullifying the impact of St Kilda full-forward and eventual [[Coleman Medal]]list [[Fraser Gehrig]], whom Barry restricted to only two possessions for the entire match.

Sydney was able to recruit another St Kilda export in the Lockett mould, [[Barry Hall]]. There were obvious parallels to the signing of Lockett (a powerful, tough forward from St Kilda with questions over his discipline and attitude), which left Hall with much to live up to. He flourished in his new surroundings and eventually became a cult figure and club leader in his own right.

As the new century dawned, Sydney implemented a policy of giving up high order draft picks in exchange for players who struggled at other clubs. It was during this era that the Swans picked up the likes of [[Paul Williams (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Williams]], [[Barry Hall]], [[Craig Bolton]], [[Darren Jolly]], [[Ted Richards]], [[Peter Everitt]], [[Martin Mattner]], [[Rhyce Shaw]], [[Shane Mumford]], [[Ben McGlynn]] and [[Mitch Morton]], amongst others, and giving up higher order draft picks meant the Swans missed out on the likes of [[Daniel Motlop]], [[Nick Dal Santo]], [[James Kelly (Australian footballer)|James Kelly]], [[Courtenay Dempsey]] and [[Sam Lonergan]] who went to {{AFL Por}}, {{AFL StK}}, {{AFL Gee}} and the latter two to {{AFL Ess}} respectively. This policy is said to have paid off in the Roos era, as they implemented a strict culture of discipline at the club.

===Premiership glory: 2005===
{{Main|2005 AFL Grand Final}}
{{Wikinews|Sydney Swans win AFL premiership after 72 years in classic match}}
In 2005, the Swans came under enormous public scrutiny, even from AFL CEO [[Andrew Demetriou]], for their unorthodox, "boring" defense-oriented tactics that included tightly controlling the tempo of the game and starving the opposition of possession (in fact, seven teams that season had their lowest possession total whilst playing against the Swans). Swans coach [[Paul Roos (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Roos]] maintained that playing contested football was the style used by all recent Premiership-winning teams, and felt that it was ironic that the much criticised strategy proved ultimately successful.

After finishing third during the regular season, the Swans lost the second qualifying final against the [[West Coast Eagles]] at [[Subiaco Oval]] on 2 September by 10.5 (65) to 10.9 (69). This dropped them into a semi-final against the [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong Cats]] at the SCG on 9 September, and the Swans trailed the Cats 31–53 before [[Nick Davis (footballer)|Nick Davis]] kicked four consecutive goals, with the last one a matter of seconds before the siren, to win the game for Sydney by 7.14 (56) to 7.11 (53). In the first preliminary final at the MCG on 16 September against [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], the Swans used a seven-goal blitz in 11 minutes of the fourth quarter to overturn an 8-point deficit and overrun the Saints by 15.6 (96) to 9.11 (65).

The Swans faced the Eagles in a rematch in the [[AFL Grand Final]] on 24 September 2005, and this time, they prevailed by four points, final score 8.10 (58) to West Coast's 7.12 (54). In the last few minutes, the Sydney defence held strong, with [[Leo Barry]] marking the ball just before the siren to stop the Eagles' final desperate shot at goal. The Premiership was the Swans' first in 72 years and their first since being based in Sydney. It was also the fifth Premiership in succession to be won by a team from outside [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

On Friday, 30 September 2005, a [[ticker tape parade]] down Sydney's [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] was held in honour of the Swans' achievements, which ended with a rally at [[Town Hall]], where Sydney [[Lord Mayor of Sydney|Lord Mayor]] [[Clover Moore]] presented the team with the key to the city. The flag of the Swans also flew on top of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] during the week; the same flag was later given to [[Western Australia|WA]] premier [[Geoff Gallop]] to fly on top of the state legislature in Perth as part of the friendly wager between Gallop and [[New South Wales|NSW]] premier [[Morris Iemma]].

===Grand final loss: 2006===
{{Main|2006 AFL Grand Final}}
As reigning premiers, the Sydney Swans started the 2006 season slowly, losing three of their first four games, including in round one to an {{AFL Ess}} side that would finish near the bottom of the ladder with only three wins and a draw, and finish with the worst defensive record of any side for the season (Sydney, conversely, had the best defensive record of any side).&lt;ref name="BombersvSwans2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-04-01/bombers-upset-swans/1721794|title=Bombers upset Swans|date=1 April 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 AFL Grand Final was contested between the Sydney Swans and West Coast Eagles at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 30 September 2006. The West Coast Eagles avenged their 2005 Grand Final defeat by beating the Sydney Swans by one point, only the fourth one-point grand final margin in the competition's history.

The rivalry between the Sydney Swans and West Coast Eagles has become one of the great modern rivalries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Forsaith|first=Rob|title=Enduring rivalry one for the birds|url=http://www.smh.com.au/afl/afl-news/enduring-rivalry-one-for-the-birds-20120714-2235s.html|accessdate=15 July 2012|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=15 July 2012|agency=Australian Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six games between the two sides (from the start of the 2005 finals to the first round of 2007 inclusive) were decided by a combined margin of 13 points. Four of those six games were finals, and 2 grand finals.

===Finals goal: 2007–2010===
{{Tone|date=August 2010}}
Sydney finished the 2007 home and away season in 7th place, and advanced to the finals, where they faced and were defeated by {{AFL Col}} by 38 points in the elimination final. It was their earliest exit from the finals since 2001 and was a culmination of a mostly disappointing season, as only victories against lesser teams saw them through to a fifth consecutive finals campaign.

The conclusion of the 2007 trade saw the loss of [[Adam Schneider]] and [[Sean Dempster]] to [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], the delisting of [[Simon Phillips (footballer)|Simon Phillips]], Jonathan Simpkin and [[Luke Vogels]], and the gain of [[Henry Playfair]] from [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and [[Martin Mattner]] from [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]].

The Swans spent the middle part of the 2008 season inside the top four, however a late form slump which yielded only three wins in the last nine rounds saw the Swans drop to sixth at the conclusion of the 2008 regular season. Having qualified for the finals for a sixth consecutive season, the Swans defeated {{AFL Nor}} in the elimination final before losing to the [[Western Bulldogs]] the following week.

2009 saw the club register only eight victories as they failed to reach the finals for the first time since 2002, finishing 12th with a percentage of below 100% for the first time since 1994. [[Barry Hall]], [[Leo Barry]], [[Jared Crouch]], [[Michael O'Loughlin]], [[Amon Buchanan]] and [[Darren Jolly]] all departed at the conclusion of the season, with [[Mark Seaby]], [[Daniel Bradshaw]] and [[Shane Mumford]], among others, joining the club during the trade period.

The 2010 season saw Sydney return to the finals by virtue of a fifth-place finish at the end of the regular season. The club defeated {{AFL Car}} by five points in the elimination final before losing to the [[Western Bulldogs]] in the semi-finals for the second time in three seasons. The loss signalled the end of the Swans coaching career of [[Paul Roos (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Roos]] as well as that of the playing career of [[Brett Kirk]].

Former {{AFL Nor}} premiership-winning forward [[John Longmire]] took over as coach of the Swans as part of a succession plan initiated by Paul Roos in 2009 prior to the beginning of the 2011 season. He led the club to a seventh-place finish at the end of the regular season, therefore qualifying for the finals for the 13th time in the past 16 seasons. The Swans defeated {{AFL StK}} in an elimination final at [[Docklands Stadium]] before losing to {{AFL Haw}} in the semi-finals the following week.

It was during the regular season that the Swans caused the upset of the season, defeating the star-studded [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong Cats]] on its home ground, [[Kardinia Park (stadium)|Skilled Stadium]], where the home tenant had won its past 29 games in succession, and its past two matches at the ground by a combined margin of 336 points, in Round 23. It was the Swans' first win over the Cats since 2006 and its first win at the ground since Round 8, 1999. The Swans were also the only team to defeat the [[West Coast Eagles]] at [[Subiaco Oval|Patersons Stadium]] during the regular season. The Swans' victory over Geelong was overshadowed by the news that co-captain [[Jarrad McVeigh]]'s baby daughter had died in the week leading up to the match, forcing him to miss that match.

[[File:Sydney Swans banner.jpg|thumb|right|Sydney Swans players run through the banner before the inaugural Sydney Derby on 24 March 2012.]]
The 2012 season began for the Swans with the inaugural Sydney Derby against AFL newcomers {{AFL GWS}}. After an even and physical first half, Sydney went on to win by 63 points. Subsequent wins over {{AFL Fre}}, {{AFL Por}}, {{AFL Nor}} and {{AFL Haw}} saw the Swans sit second behind {{AFL WC}} on percentage after Round 5, but the Swans would proceed to lose three of their next four matches before embarking on a nine-match winning streak between Rounds 10 and 19 inclusive. The Swans eventually finished the regular season in third place after losing three of their final four matches, all against their fellow top-four rivals (Collingwood, Hawthorn and Geelong in Rounds 20, 22 and 23 respectively).

The Swans defeated {{AFL Ade}} by 29 points in their qualifying final at [[AAMI Stadium]], thus earning a week off and a home preliminary final, where they then defeated {{AFL Col}} by 26 points to qualify for their first grand final since 2006, ending an eleven-match losing streak against the Magpies in the process.

In the grand final, the Swans defeated Hawthorn [[2012 AFL Grand Final|by ten points]] in front of 99,683 people at the MCG, with [[Nick Malceski]] kicking a snap goal with 34 seconds left to seal the Swans' fifth premiership and first since 2005. Ryan O'Keefe was named the Norm Smith Medallist and the Swan's best player in September

[[Image:Sydney Swans warming up 2013.jpg|thumb|The Sydney Swans warm up before a match in 2013.]]
The Swans' [[2013 AFL season|2013 season]] was marred by long-term injuries to many of its key players, namely [[Adam Goodes]], Sam Reid, [[Lewis Jetta]], [[Rhyce Shaw]] and [[Lewis Roberts-Thomson]], among others; despite this setback, the team were still able to reach the finals for the fifteenth time in 18 seasons, reaching the preliminary finals where they were defeated by {{AFL Fre}} at [[Subiaco Oval|Patersons Stadium]], its first loss at the venue since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2013-09-21/dockers-smother-swans Dockers smother Swans to reach first Grand Final], AFL.com.au official website, 21 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theroar.com.au/2013/09/26/2013-afl-season-review-sydney-swans/ 2013 AFL Season review: Sydney Swans], ''The Roar'', 26 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 AFL season began with some difficulties for the Swans. Sydney lost their first game against {{AFL GWS}} and then to Collingwood before becoming the first non-South Australian team to win at [[Adelaide Oval]] defeating Adelaide by 63 points with Lance Franklin and Luke Parker kicking 4 goals each. After a loss to North Melbourne in Round 4, the Swans' won twelve games in a row, including victories against 2013 grand finalists Fremantle and Hawthorn, Geelong by 110 points at the SCG and then ladder leaders Port Adelaide. In Round 17, the Swans defeated Carlton to match a winning streak set three times in club history, the last of which came way back in 1935,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenewdaily.com.au/sport/2014/07/12/dozen-unstoppable-sydney-swans/|title=Dozen up for unstoppable Swans – The New Daily|date=12 July 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually closed out the season with their first minor premiership in 18 years and a club record 17 wins for the season, eclipsing the previous highest of 16, which was achieved on six past occasions in 2012, 1996, 1986, 1945, 1936 and 1935. In 2014 the Swans were minor premiers, and also qualified for the [[2014 AFL Grand Final]]. They defeated [[Fremantle Dockers|Fremantle]] at home in the first qualifying final in Round one of the finals series and so earned a one-week break. In the first preliminary final the Swans had a convincing win against [[North Melbourne Kangaroos|North Melbourne]], which led them to their fourth grand final in 10 years. The [[2014 AFL Grand Final]] was played on Saturday 27 September 2014 in near perfect weather conditions, with Sydney seen as favourites leading up to the match. This was the first time in a finals series that former Hawk player [[Lance Franklin]] would play against his former team, one of very few players to have played back to back grand finals for two different teams. The Hawks dominated the game quite early and eventually defeated the Swans 11.8.(74) to 21.11.(137). The 63-point loss was Sydney's biggest ever loss in a grand final and their biggest defeat all season, meaning Hawthorn would become back to back premiers for the second time in their history.

The Swans started the 2015 AFL season well, winning their first three, before losing their next 2 games against [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]], where they trailed by as many as 8 goals before half-time, and the [[Western Bulldogs]]. They won their next 6 leading into the bye, including home wins against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]], and an upset away win against [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] in the grand final replay. The Swans lost their first game after the bye, their 3rd of the season to [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] at the SCG, 11.11 (77) to 14.11. (95). The Swans rebounded with unconvincing wins against [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] and [[Brisbane Lions Football Club|Brisbane Lions]], before suffering their heaviest defeat for 17 seasons against the [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawks]] by 89 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/biggest-loss-in-17-years-a-humiliation-for-swans-says-luke-parker-20150719-gifoiw.html|title=Biggest loss in 17 years a humiliation for Swans, says Luke Parker|first=Sebastian|last=Hassett|date=19 July 2015|website=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week was no better with a road trip to Perth and another loss, this time to the [[West Coast Eagles|Eagles]] by 52 points, the scoreline ultimately flattering the Swans. The Swans bounced back against Adelaide with a convincing win 52-point win, but lost their next game to [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] at [[Kardinia Park (stadium)|Simmonds stadium]]; a close affair that Geelong blew apart in the 3rd quarter. The Swans won their final 4 games to secure a top 4 finish, against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], {{AFL GWS}}, [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] and {{AFL GCS}}.

The Swans faced minor premiers [[Fremantle Dockers|Fremantle]] in the first qualifying final, their first finals match without Franklin, who had withdrawn from the finals due to illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-09-08/star-swan-franklin-out-of-final-against-freo-with-ongoing-mental-health-condition], AFL.com.au official website, 8 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately the Swans would go down in a low scoring affair, effectively kicking themselves out of the game after losing [[Sam Reid (Australian footballer born 1991)|Sam Reid]] to a hamstring injury midway through the 2nd quarter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/video-sam-reid-subbed-out-of-sydneys-qualifying-final-with-fremantle-with-hamstring-injury/story-e6frf3e3-1227524180065], Fox Sports, 12 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The following week the Swans were knocked out of the finals in a one-sided contest against [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]], struggling to score throughout the first half with the game effectively over by half-time. For the first time since 2011, the Swans failed to make a preliminary final.

The Swans' continued period of success, in which it has missed the finals only three times since 1995, has led to some criticism about a [[salary cap]] concession which the club receives; the concession is in the form of an additional Cost of Living Allowance (COLA), due to the higher cost of living in Sydney compared with any other Australian city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/salary-cap-gave-swans-the-flag-say-hawks/story-e6frexx0-1226497327257|title=Hawks and Crows critical of Swans' salary cap – thetelegraph.com.au|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/afl-turns-up-heat-on-sydneys-cost-of-living-allowance/story-e6frexwr-1226497138805|title=Dailytelegraph.com.au – Subscribe to The Daily Telegraph for exclusive stories|website=www.dailytelegraph.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was, however, announced in March 2014 that this allowance would be scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2014-03-04/afl-to-scrap-cola AFL to scrap COLA], AFL.com.au official website, 4 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The trade ban was fought by the club before the 2015 season and a reprieve was won, with the AFL allowing the club to participate in the 2015 AFL draft. There was a catch however, with the league imposing an edict that the club could only recruit players at or below current average wage of $340,000 (adjusted figures for 2015 was $349,000).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-01-21/swans-ok-to-trade-afl], AFL.com.au official website, 21 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2015 season, with the Swans team stretched by aging players and injuries, it had become apparent that the trade restrictions that had prevented the Swans from participating in the 2014 draft, had impacted the list. With the trade period looming, Andrew Pridham lobbied the AFL to lift the trade restrictions, labeling the ban as a restraint of trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-08-14/swans-chairman-calls-for-trade-ban-to-be-banished], AFL.com.au official website, 14 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In response to continued discussions between the club and league, as well as lobbying by the AFLPA,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-players-association-joins-fight-over-sydney-swans-trading-ban-20150820-gj4504.html], ''The Age'', 20 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; the league further relaxed the trade restrictions for the Swans during the 2015 AFL Finals. The AFL changed the sanctions so that the Swans could replace a player that leaves the club as either a free agent, or through trade, with another player on a contract up to $450,000 per year. This allowed the Swans to trade for [[Callum Sinclair]] in a swap deal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-10-14/eagles-swans-agree-to-straight-sinclairjetta-swap], AFL.com.au official website, 14 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; as well as trade a late pick for out-of-contract defender, [[Michael Talia]] from the Western Bulldogs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-trade-period-2015-former-bulldog-michael-talia-moves-to-swans-in-lastminute-trade-deal-20151022-gkfzhi.html], ''The Age'', 22 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swans started off the 2016 season with a convincing 80-point round 1 win against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], with new Swans recruit [[Michael Talia]] suffering a long term foot injury. They followed up the next round with a 60-point win against the Blues, with new recruit [[Callum Sinclair]] kicking 3 goals. The following week they defeated GWS by 25 points, with [[Lance Franklin]] kicking 4 goals. In the following match against the Crows, [[Isaac Heeney]] starred with 18 touches and 4 goals in a losing side. Three more wins followed, against West Coast, Brisbane and Essendon respectively before a shock loss to Richmond in round 8 by a solitary point, after a kick after the siren. They bounced back to win against top spot North Melbourne, and the Hawks at the MCG, with Lance Franklin booting 3 goals, including a bomb from 80 metres. After a tight slog against the Suns, the Swans played the Giants once more and were defeated in the club's 100th game. They won their next game by 55 points against the Demons, in a fourth quarter breeze. After a bye in Round 14, the Sydney Swans lost their first game after, again with the last kick of the game, by 4 points. The week after was soured by a family feud involving co-captain [[Kieren Jack]] and his parents, after they were reportedly told by him not to come to is 200-game milestone. After the unfortunate spat, Jack led the Swans to an emphatic upset victory against Geelong, booting 3 goals and gathering 24 possessions in the one-sided 38-point victory at Simonds Stadium. They then travelled back home where they faced Hawthorn and lost their 3rd match of the season by under a goal, as Buddy went goalless for the first time in the season. After an unconvincing win the following week against Carlton, the Swans went on to win their last 5 home and away games by a combined total of 349 points, giving them top spot and a home qualifying final.

Ahead of their first final against cross-town rivals the Giants, the Swans confirmed that they would play all home finals at the SCG except for Sydney Derbies, which would be played at ANZ Stadium. The final would create history, being the first Sydney Derby to be played in a final. It was also the first time that the Giants would make the finals in their fifth year. In a low-scoring first half, the Swans were very competitive, trailing by only 2 points. However, a mark not paid to Isaac Heeney midway through the third quarter turned all the momentum the Giants way, as they kicked away to win by 36 points. The Swans only kicked 2 goals after half-time with Giant [[Jeremy Cameron]] outscoring them in the third quarter alone with 3 goals. They were quick to bounce back the following week, thumping the [[Adelaide Crows]] by 6 goals, with Franklin and [[Tom Papley]] kicking 4 goals a piece, after a blistering 7 goal to 1 quarter. The story was pretty much the same in the preliminary final against the [[Geelong Cats]] at the MCG. The Swans kept the Cats goalless for the first quarter, and were never really challenged in their 37-point triumph. It would take them to their third grand final in 5 years, against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG. After leading by a scant 2-point margin at half time, the Bulldogs pulled away towards the end of the fourth quarter to hand Sydney their second grand final loss in three years.

The Swans began the 2017 season with six straight losses, after being upset at home by Port Adelaide in the opening round, they were upset by Collingwood and Carlton, and suffered defeats to the Western Bulldogs, Greater Western Sydney (who won their first game at the SCG) and West Coast Eagles (in Perth). However, they managed to win 13 of their last 15, losing both their games to [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] by 1 goal. Some of their best wins include against the reigning premiers the Bulldogs, GWS, and comeback wins against Richmond and Essendon. After becoming the first grand-finalist to lose their first six games, they have become the first team to reach the finals after starting the season 0–6. They would comprehensively defeat Essendon in their first final, before slumping to an ugly defeat against Geelong, ending their season.

The Swans had an indifferent 2018, compounded by their struggles at home, losing 5 out of 11 games at the SCG. A lean patch of form which included upset losses to Gold Coast (for the first time ever) and Essendon (for the first time since 2011) had them looking likely to miss finals altogether. However three out of four wins in the last four rounds was enough to see them into their ninth consecutive finals series, where they were comprehensively beaten by GWS in the Elimination Final.

==Club identity==

===Guernsey===

The jumper is white with a red back and a red yoke with a silhouette of the [[Sydney Opera House]] at the point of the yoke. The Opera House design was first used at the start of the 1987 season, replacing the traditional red "V" on white design. Until 1991, the back of the jumper was white with the yoke only extending to the back of the shoulders and each side of the jumper had a red vertical stripe. The current predominantly red design appeared at the start of the 1992 season. The club's major sponsor is [[QBE Insurance]]. In 2004 the club added the initials 'SMFC' in white lettering at the back of the collar to honour the club's past as South Melbourne Football Club. The move was welcomed by Melbourne-based fans. The clash guernsey is a predominantly white version of the home guernsey similar to the original Opera House guernsey design, including a white back, but it is rarely used, since the two Queensland clubs (the [[Brisbane Lions]] and [[Gold Coast Football Club|Gold Coast Suns]]) and cross town rivals [[Greater Western Sydney Giants|GWS Giants]] are the only clubs with which there is a clash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sydneyswans.com.au/news/2012-10-31/swans-2013-fixture-released Swans 2013 fixture released], Sydney Swans official website, 31 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[International Sports Clothing|ISC]] have manufactured the Swans' apparel since [[2010 AFL season|2010]], replacing long-time sponsor [[Puma SE|Puma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isc-sports.com.au/about-isc/history/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131104222641/http://www.isc-sports.com.au/about-isc/history/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-11-04|title=ISC 2018 COMING SOON|website=www.isc-sports.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Song===
The club song is known as ''Cheer, Cheer The Red and The White''' and is to the tune of the ''[[Victory March (fight song)|Victory March]]'', the fight song of the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish]] in South Bend, Indiana, USA, which was written by [[University of Notre Dame]] graduates and brothers Rev. Michael J. Shea and John F. Shea. In 1961, the school and other musical houses granted South Melbourne a copyright to adapt the ''Victory March'' into the new club song, which replaced an adaptation of ''[[Springtime in the Rockies (1937 film)|Springtime in the Rockies]]'' by [[Gene Autry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sydneyswans.com.au/club/our-club/club-song Sydney Swans Club Song] SydneySwans.com.au&lt;/ref&gt; Port Adelaide also has used the ''Victory March'' as the basis for their club song since 1971, though their senior team changed their club song to their current original ''Power To Win'' after their entry into the AFL.

George Gershwin's ''[[Swanee (song)|Swanee]]'' (1919) was used by the club in marketing promotions during the late 1990s.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Mascot===
[[File:Swans mascot.jpg|thumb|100px|Syd 'Swannie' Skilton, Sydney Swans Mascot Manor mascot]]The Sydney Swans' mascot for the [[Mascot Manor|AFL's Mascot Manor]] is Syd 'Swannie' Skilton.
He is named after Swans legend [[Bob Skilton]]. The actual mascot at Sydney's home games is, however, still known as ''Cyggy'' (as in [[swan|cygnet]]).

===Home ground===
Since the [[2016 AFL season]], the Swans have played all their home games at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], a 48,000 capacity venue located in inner-east [[Sydney]]. The venue has been home to Swans home games since the club's relocation to Sydney in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/afl/sydney-swans/sydney--swans-to-play-all-afl-games-at-scg-after-quitting-anz-stadium-20160229-gn6h1f.html|title=Sydney Swans to play all AFL games at SCG after quitting ANZ Stadium|date=29 February 2016|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years 2002–2015, the Swans played between three and four home matches per season and most home [[AFL finals series|finals]] matches at [[Stadium Australia]] (commercially known as [[Australia and New Zealand Banking Group|ANZ]] Stadium), an 80,000 capacity stadium located in the west of the city. During the first five years at the ground average crowds were high, but issues with the surface as well as fan and player disengagement resulted in the club ending its association with the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2016/03/01/rise-fall-anz-stadium-afl-venue/|title=The rise and fall of ANZ Stadium as an AFL venue|work=The Roar|date=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporter base==
[[File:Sydney swans supporters at the 2006 afl grand final.jpg|thumb|Sydney Swans supporters]]
The Sydney Swans have built a strong following in the city they've called home since moving from South Melbourne. Attendances and memberships grew dramatically during the Lockett era, helped out by the [[Super League War]] plaguing Rugby League. The Swans continue to have a strong supporter base in Victoria with attendances for Swans games in Melbourne being much higher than other non-Victorian teams.

==Rivalries==

===Greater Western Sydney===
{{main|Sydney Derby (AFL)}}
The introduction of the [[Greater Western Sydney Giants|GWS Giants]] to the AFL in [[2012 AFL season|2012]] resulted in the formation of the [[Sydney Derby (AFL)|Sydney Derby]]. The Swans compete against their cross-city rivals twice every season. The best performed player from every derby match is awarded the '''Brett Kirk Medal'''.

===West Coast Eagles===
{{See also|Sydney–West Coast AFL rivalry}}
[[File:Barry Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Barry Hall]] and [[Darren Glass]]]]
The Swans developed a famous [[AFL team rivalries|modern rivalry]] against the Perth-based [[West Coast Eagles]] between 2005 and 2007, when six consecutive games between the two teams, including two qualifying finals and two grand finals, were decided by less than a goal. The rivalry was highlighted by Sydney's four-point win against West Coast in the [[2005 AFL Grand Final|2005 Grand Final]], and West Coast's one-point win against Sydney in the [[2006 AFL Grand Final|2006 Grand Final]].

===Hawthorn===

The Sydney and [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] rivalry has been more recent, they have played in two grand finals ([[2012 AFL Grand Final|2012]] and [[2014 AFL Grand Final|2014]]). The Swans beat Hawthorn in 2012 by 10 points to claim their fifth premiership. The rivalry grew in 2013, when Hawthorn forward Lance Franklin transferred to the Swans as a free agent on a nine-year, $10&amp;nbsp;million deal. In 2014, the Swans finished minor premiers and were favourites to win the grand final, however Hawthorn beat Sydney by 63 points. Both teams have had close games since their grand final matches, in 2017 the Hawks beat Sydney twice (both by six points).

==Reserves team==
{{Main|Australian Football League reserves affiliations}}
The Swans currently field a reserves team in the [[North East Australian Football League]]. Previously a reserves team was first created for South Melbourne in 1919 and continued to compete in the Victorian reserves competition until 1999 despite the team relocating to Sydney in 1982. The team enjoyed little success in the Victorian competition; it was the only reserves team never to win a premiership, and its best performances were losing grand finals in 1927, 1956 and 1980. In 2000 the Swans entered a reserves team in the [[Sydney AFL]] competition but withdrew prior to the finals series because the club felt the difference in standard was too greatly in favour of the Swans. Between 2001 and 2002 the Swans affiliated themselves with the [[Port Melbourne Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League|VFL]] while also starting a new stand-alone team named the Redbacks in the Sydney AFL competition. Little success resulted and the Swans entered a stand-alone reserves team in the [[AFL Canberra]] competition in 2003 which resulted in four consecutive premierships between 2005 and 2008. In 2011 the Swans reserves team joined the North East Australian Football League with the rest of the AFL Canberra competition and now have regular matches against AFL reserve teams from the [[Brisbane Lions]], [[Gold Coast Suns]] and [[GWS Giants]]. The team plays home games at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] and will often play as a curtain raiser to senior AFL games.

In [[2011 NEAFL season|2011]] the Swans reserves finished the home and away season with the Eastern Conference minor premiership. In the Eastern Conference grand final [[Ainslie Football Club|Ainslie]] caused a major upset when they defeated the Swans by 52 points. The team suffered the same fate in [[2012 NEAFL season|2012]] when [[Queanbeyan Football Club|Queanbeyan]] defeated them by 30 points in the Eastern Conference grand final. The Swans reserves would then go on to play in three losing NEAFL grand finals in 2013, 2014 and 2016 respectively.

==Media coverage==

===Print===

The Sydney Swans receive regular exposure from Sydney's two major daily newspapers, [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]], the [[Sydney Morning Herald]] and their respective counterpart publications, [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Sunday Telegraph]] and [[The Sun-Herald]]. Articles about the Swans can occasionally be found in local community newspapers, free magazines and Sydney street press publications.

===Radio===

The Sydney Swans are sponsored by radio station [[2MMM|Triple M]] which broadcasts all of its games, including finals, live. Occasionally, [[702 ABC Sydney]] may cover Swans matches if they are played on a Saturday afternoon, regardless of where they are playing. If they play in Sydney during that time schedule, appropriately 702 ABC Sydney will cover the match. Matches played at other times and days are broadcast on the [[ABC NewsRadio]] station's analogue AM/FM frequencies for listeners in Sydney, Newcastle, the NSW Central Coast and Canberra. Most Swans matches can be heard by listeners in the Riverina region of N.S.W. via the [[ABC Riverina]] – [[Wagga Wagga]] ([[2RVR]]) service, on the 675 AM frequency. Match coverage can be heard anywhere in the world via live streaming at the official AFL website or by downloading the AFL app for smartphones such as the [[iPhone]] and [[Samsung Galaxy]].

===Television===

From 2002 to 2011 [[Network Ten]] would televise all Swans games played in Melbourne and outside of [[N.S.W.]] live, but on a half-hour delay when played in Sydney for Sydney viewers and via affiliated stations in N.S.W and [[Canberra]]. In past and recent years the [[Seven Network]] would broadcast Swans games to viewers in Sydney and most of N.S.W. and Canberra via the Prime TV network (now branded as [[Prime7]]). Matches were telecast either live, on a 30–90-minute delayed broadcast or late-night replay. Commencing 2002 all their games were broadcast live or on same day delay by Subscription television provider [[Foxtel]] across Australia on either the [[Fox Footy Channel]] or [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] channels.

From 2012 to 2016, the AFL commenced a new broadcast deal requiring the [[Seven Network]] and their affiliate station [[Prime7]] to broadcast all Sydney Swans (and [[Greater Western Sydney Giants]]) games live to viewers in Sydney and most of regional [[New South Wales]] and [[Canberra]]. These games are screened on the [[7mate]] channel in these regions. [[Foxtel]] also signed a new broadcast deal for the 2012 – 2016 seasons which included screening all AFL matches (including all Swans games) live across Australia on their [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] and [[Fox Footy]] channels.

'''''The Great American Baseball Card Flipping, Trading and Bubble Gum Book''''' (Little Brown, 1973) is a book written by Brendan C. Boyd &amp; Fred C. Harris about [[baseball cards]], primarily ones issued during the 1950s and 1960s, and the players on the cards.

==Authors==

Neither Brendan C. Boyd nor Fred C. Harris had published any books nor possessed any special expertise in the field of sports or sports memorablia when they decided to write ''The Great American Baseball Card Flipping, Trading and Bubble Gum Book''.&lt;ref name="The Dickie Thon Fan Club"&gt;http://www.angelfire.com/tx2/dickiethon/bubblegum.html (The Dickie Thon Fan Club)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1970 while both were employed at a Boston, Mass. bookstore, a customer inquired about books on baseball cards.  Surprised to learn that there weren't any works on the subject, Harris told Boyd, "we should write one."&lt;ref name="The Archive"&gt;http://www.geocities.com/chrisstufflestreet/archive25.html (The Archive)&lt;/ref&gt; So they pored over the cards they had collected in their youth and wrote ''The Great American Baseball Card Flipping, Trading and Bubble Gum Book''. Although the book doesn't indicate which author contributed which parts, generally Boyd covered players from the American League and Harris those in the National League.&lt;ref name="The Archive"/&gt; Publication of the book was probably aided by the 1972 publication of Roger Kahn's ''[[The Boys of Summer (book)|The Boys of Summer]]'', which rekindled interest in 1950s baseball.

Brendan C. Boyd is co-author of The Great American Baseball Card Flipping, Trading And Bubblegum Book. Brendan wrote another book, published in 1993, titled ''Blue Ruin: A Novel of the 1919 World Series''.  According to the back of ''Blue Ruin'', "Brendan Boyd is a native of Boston who now lives in Paris with his wife, Elaine."&lt;ref name="Blue Ruin"&gt;http://webpages.charter.net/joekuras/blueruin.htm (Blue Ruin)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the introduction to the 1991 reissue edition of ''The Great American Baseball Card Flipping, Trading and Bubble Gum Book,'' he noted that his car had been stolen, and along with it his baseball card collection.

Fred C. Harris is honored to be known as co-author of "the 'Spinal Tap' of baseball books" - The Great American Baseball Card Flipping, Trading And Bubblegum Book.

He has been a professional student, mass merchant, entrepreneur, IT contractor, and founder of two companies. He has been a frequent guest on radio and television, most notably on The Late Show With David Letterman, and The Larry King Show.

Seamhead Press re-issued the book in a Kindle edition in April 2015. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WT1EZ9A Kindle Edition]
 
When he's not writing, he's either watching the Patriots, the Bruins or the Red Sox, out walking with his wife Gail, or playing his vintage Martin D-18 guitar.

When The Great American Baseball Card Flipping, Trading And Bubblegum Book was first published in 1973, it was the first book to look back at Boomer kids growing up in the 1950s and 1960s, playing baseball in the street with no adult supervision.

==Subject Matter==

"The Great American Baseball Card Flipping, Trading and Bubble Gum Book," presents a humorous and usually irreverent account of the baseball cards that were distributed during the authors' youths and of the players depicted on the cards.  The basic format consists of an image of a card of a player, or in a few instances a manager or umpire, accompanied by a short characterization of the card and the player.  The commentary for each card ranges from a single sentence to a few hundred words.  Unlike most sports-related publications, the vast majority of players featured in this book possessed mediocre talent and had been largely forgotten by 1973.

The book is not a baseball card guide in any respect and makes no pretense of being one—there's no indication what a card is worth or even that it has any intrinsic value other than the memories it invokes.  Baseball card collecting in 1973 was primarily a childhood activity and invariably abandoned by young adulthood.  The authors' stated assumption is that the cards one collected in his youth are all gone, as revealed in the book's closing comments, "We know, your mother, your own mother, threw them away."  Instead, the authors present a nostalgic look at the part of their youth that involved collecting, trading, and flipping baseball cards.

==Sections==

The book is divided into four sections:

* Where Have You Gone Vince DiMaggio (Some Reflections On a Baseball Card Childhood)
* This Kid Is Going to Make It
* Profiles
* Some Final Observations on Trading, Hoarding, Collecting and Other Aberrations of the Baseball Card Life

The first section reminisces in a rapid-fire stream of consciousness flow about growing up and eventually coming of age in 1950s suburban America with [[Pez]], cap-guns, [[Jujubes]], and baseball cards.  The second section delves into the [[Topps]] trading card company and its pioneering executive [[Sy Berger]] circa 1973.  "There was Topps and then there was Topps," Harris says in the introduction to the 1991 reissue. (ref 2)

The bulk and the heart of the book is the section called "Profiles," containing the card images and player biographies.  Usually one or two players are featured per page and the biography is by no means meant to be complete or unbiased, but rather a quick snapshot of what the authors remembered most about the player.  In all there are 221 baseball players featured&lt;ref name="Blue Ruin"/&gt; with no stated or apparent reason for their selection, although it can be gathered that many were picked for the humor potential inherent in some aspect of the player or the card itself.  Most of the cards were issued from 1951 to 1963 with a few later ones included.&lt;ref name="The Archive"/&gt;

The last section of the book offers a short discourse on things to do with cards, from hoarding, trading, to finally collecting.  The ending foreshadows the adult hobby of collecting baseball cards that was about to explode, although it is unlikely the authors were prescient of this.

==Themes &amp; Threads==

The book is not written in a linear fashion.  Each card and its accompanying commentary, with a few rare exceptions, stand alone and are not categorized, such as by team, league, era, position, etc.  The ultimate effect of the seemingly scattershot arrangement is that the reader can start most anywhere and jump about without any loss of comprehension.  That said, there are unstated themes that run through the book, or they could be described as threads that hold the story together.

'''Star players vs. journeymen players—'''
Unlike most every other sports book, and specifically those covering baseball players of the 1950s and early 1960s, ''The Great American Baseball Card Flipping, Trading and Bubble Gum Book'' does not focus on the stars and legends of the game but rather on the lesser and forgotten players.  Probably more than anything else this is what defines the book and gives it a unique perspective.

The great players, however, are not ignored; in fact, of the 221 presented, 15 are in the Baseball Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="The Archive"/&gt; Among the stars mentioned are [[Sandy Koufax]] (seen on his rookie card which is dubbed his “Bar Mizvah picture” because he looks so young), [[Ernie Banks]] (remembered for having played on bad teams and being loved by everyone), [[Stan Musial]] (because of the unsolved mystery of why there was no card of him in 1950 and 1951) and [[Yogi Berra]] (because he's Yogi Berra).  Those who didn’t get mentioned include [[Hank Aaron]], [[Warren Spahn]], [[Harmon Killebrew]], [[Frank Robinson]], [[Whitey Ford]], and [[Roger Maris]].  [[Mickey Mantle]] is mentioned, but not only is his card not shown, it’s belittled for having been so abundant one year.

'''Players who have been forgotten—'''
It can be said that the book "is about players who have long since been forgotten by everybody but those who grew up collecting their cards and thinking them important simply because they were Major League ballplayers."&lt;ref name="The Dickie Thon Fan Club"/&gt;   The primary reason many of these players have been forgotten is because they weren’t very good, and that is how Boyd and Harris have remembered them:  Some because they couldn’t field well, such as [[Dick Stuart]] and [[Marv Throneberry]], quite a few, including [[Doug Camilli]] and [[Eddie Miksis]], because they couldn’t hit, or [[Casey Wise]], who ''really'' couldn't hit; and of course those who couldn’t pitch, like [[Dave DeBusschere]] and [[Eli Grba]] (of whom the authors report, "In addition to having the hardest name to pronounce in the big leagues he also had just about the worst stuff").

'''Players with funny names—'''
Several players are recalled because they had confusing or unusual names.  [[Wayne Terwilliger]], [[Cal McLish|Calvin Coolidge Julius Caesar Tuskahoma McLish]], [[Coot Veal]], [[Cot Deal|"Cot" Deal]], Whammy Douglas, and Foster Castleman, fall into this category. The book has this to say about Foster Castleman, “Of course a ballplayer with a name like this is never going to amount to anything.  If you have a name like an orthodontist you’re going to play like an orthodontist.  The guy never really had a shot.” One item amusing to the authors was the player named [[Gail Harris (baseball)|Boyd Gail Harris]], whose full name coincidentally matches the two authors' last names plus one of the authors' wife's name.

'''Cards about the card—'''
A good many of the capsules in the profiles section are more about the baseball card itself than the player depicted.  In some the authors remark about the prevalence or difficulty in obtaining the card: "[[Toby Atwell]] has to be remembered by any serious collector of baseball cards in 1952 as having been one of the most difficult cards to acquire," the authors write. "The career of Toby Atwell as player was secondary to the career of Toby Atwell as baseball card, and if you needed him to complete your set too, you'll know what I mean." In many others, Harris and Boyd point out some absurdity, such as slipshod graphics, an absurd remark about the player, or the player's silly pose or expression.  One example is [[Bob Cerv]]'s 1958 Topps card, where it looks as if he's whacking himself in the head with his bat.  Another card fitting this category is that of pitcher [[Harvey Haddix]], who is best remembered for once having pitched 12{{frac|1|3}} innings of perfect baseball only to lose the game in the 13th inning after allowing one hit.  He is shown with a forlorn smile.  The bio tells us that it “is the reluctantly self-deprecating smile of the perennially dumped-on, the wry smile of the universal victim, the man who expects very little of his peers and knows secretly that he’s going to have to settle for quite a good deal less.”

==Style==

Much of the book's humor and thus its appeal derives from the authors' style, which is integral to the narration.  Although there are notable exceptions, for the most part the overt writing style could be characterized as breezy, goofy, and irreverent, at times to the point of being ridiculing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/24-karat-diamond-writing-gems-volume-2/(The HardballTimes)&lt;/ref&gt;  Somewhat curiously though, perhaps because of the reader's awareness of the authors' respect for the game and the inherent difficulty of playing it at the major league level, the ultimate effect is to glorify the effort made by the humdrum player because he was part of game that was a significant part of one’s youth.  The following two quotes from the book are representative of the style used in the "Profiles" section:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Quick, name a major league baseball player who was born in San Remo, Italy, lived in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, and couldn't hit. That's right--[[Reno Bertoia]].
OK. Name another one.
The back of Reno's card is interesting. It says that his average last year was .162 and that, although he did not get to play in too many ballgames, he gained valuable information about American League hurlers that would help him in the future. I suspect that the information he gathered was that every pitcher in the American League could get him out, and that perhaps he should try another line of work.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now, it is not necessary for me to declare that Hector Lopez was the worst fielding third baseman in the history of baseball. Everyone knows that. It is more or less a matter of public record. But I do feel called upon somehow to try to indicate, if only for the historical archivists among us, the sheer depths of his innovative barbarousness. Hector Lopez was a butcher. Pure and Simple. A butcher. His range was about one step to either side, his hands seemed to be made of concrete and his defensive attitude was so cavalier and arbitrary as to hardly constitute an attitude at all. Hector did not simply field a groundball, he attacked it. Like a farmer trying to kill a snake with a stick. And his mishandling of routine infield flies was the sort of which legends are made. Hector Lopez was not just a bad fielder for a third baseman. In fact, Hector Lopez was not just a bad fielder for a baseball player. Hector Lopez was, when every factor has been taken into consideration, a bad fielder for a human being. The stands are full of obnoxious leather-lunged cretins who insist they can play better than most major leaguers. Well, in Hector's case they could have been right. I would like to go on record right here and now as declaring Hector Lopez the all-time worst fielding major league ballplayer. That's quite a responsibility there, Hector, but I have every confidence you'll be able to live up to it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are a few notable exceptions to the satirical style, in which straightforward reverence is paid, usually to the game's greats.  The card for Ted Williams says simply, "In 1955, there were 77,263,127 male American human beings.  And every one of them in his heart of hearts would have given two arms, a leg and his collection of [[Davy Crockett]] iron-ons to be Teddy Ballgame."  (The glowing comments on the Williams card when juxtaposed with the rather disdainful ones in the closing section of the book about a 1955 Mickey Mantle card reflect the authors' Bostonian bias for the [[Red Sox]] in that team's fabled rivalry with the [[New York Yankees]].)

The commentary accompanying [[Satchel Paige]]'s card lists Mr. Paiges oft-quoted "Rules for Staying Young" and concludes with the authors' own prophetic pronouncement: "Satchel Paige could have been the greatest pitcher in major league history, if he'd been given the chance.  Don't look back, America, something might be gaining on you."

And the cards of [[Jackie Robinson]] and [[Roberto Clemente]], in honor of their notable off-field heroics and recent deaths, are each posted on a black background with no comment at all.

== Reviews, Citations &amp; Legacy ==

Although the book was never a bestseller and has spent much more time out-of-print than in print since its publication, it has nonetheless attained a cult following&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/24-karat-diamond-writing-gems-volume-2/(The Hardball Times)&lt;/ref&gt; and been frequently cited by many publications and online resources.

Perhaps the book's most lasting legacy is the contribution it made, albeit unwittingly, to the adult hobby of card collecting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/24-karat-diamond-writing-gems-volume-2/(The Hardball Times&lt;/ref&gt;  Harris and Boyd, like many other boys who grew up in the 1950s and 1960s, collected cards as youths, lost interest in the hobby in their teen years, and rekindled the hobby in their adult years.  The difference was that Harris and Boyd actually wrote a book about it because at the time there were no others.

{{WNBA Awards}}
The '''Women's National Basketball Association's Rookie of the Year Award''' is an annual [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA) award given since the [[1998 WNBA season]], to the top [[rookie]] of the regular season. The winner is selected by a panel of sportswriters throughout the [[United States]], each of whom casts a vote for first, second and third place selections. Each first-place vote is worth five points; each second-place vote is worth three points; and each third-place vote is worth one point. The player(s) with the highest point total, regardless of the number of first-place votes, wins the award.

The 2003 award winner [[Cheryl Ford]] and 2011 award winner [[Maya Moore]] are the only players to win both the WNBA Rookie of the Year award and a WNBA championship in the same season.

The 2008 award winner was [[Candace Parker]] who became the first player to win the award after garnering all possible votes and also the first player to win the [[WNBA Most Valuable Player Award]] in the same season. In the [[NBA]], only [[Wilt Chamberlain]] and [[Wes Unseld]] have won the Most Valuable Player Award and Rookie of the Year Award in the same season.

As of 2011, six Rookie of the Year recipients have gone on to become a member of a WNBA championship team.

'''Water jousting''' is a sport practised principally in [[France]] and also [[Switzerland]] and [[Germany]].  It is a form of [[jousting]] where the adversaries, carrying a lance and protected only by a shield, stand on a platform on the stern of a boat.  The boat is propelled by oarsmen or, in some cases, a motor may be used.  The aim of the sport is to send the adversary into the water whilst maintaining one's own balance on the platform.

The jousters stand on a wooden platform on their boats.  As the two competing boats draw level with each other, each jouster, protected by their shield, uses their lance to push their opponent off the platform and into the water.  The exact rules of the contest vary from region to region and country to country.

==Ancient world==
The oldest representations of water jousting have been found on bas-reliefs dating from the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians (2780 – 2380BC).  It would seem however, that these relate more to a form of brawling than a leisure activity; given that the jousters are wearing no form of protection and carry gaffes armed with two points at their end.

Evidence of jousting is subsequently found in [[Ancient Greece]]. The Greeks introduced the practice into Sicily where the Latins, great lovers of all kinds of spectacle, immediately adopted it.  Indeed, there are countless signs of jousting in the [[Roman Empire]], especially during [[naumachia]] (literally "naval combat").  The latter featured naval re-enactments and other water-sports that took place in arenas designed to be flooded for the purpose.  In all likelihood, the Romans introduced these types of games throughout their empire.  Evidence for this comes from the description of a fête held at [[Strasbourg]] in 303 in honour of Emperor [[Diocletian]].  Some historians argue, however, for an introduction of the games from the foundation of Massilia, a Greek colony founded in 570BC and later to become the French city of [[Marseille]].

==Development in France==
After Roman times, there is no record of water jousting until the twelfth century. It is possible that the sport survived during the intervening period in communities close to water, but it is not mentioned anywhere. The oldest document dating from the post Roman period in France refers to a jousting tournament in [[Lyon]] on 2 June 1177, to commemorate the millennium of the Christian martyrs of Lyon and [[Vienna]]. Another document tells us that "in 1270 in [[Aigues-Mortes]], crusaders, soldiers and sailors, awaiting embarkation for the [[Holy Land]] with [[King Louis IX]] (Saint Louis), faced off in single combat mounted on small boats.

Documents both written and illustrated become more numerous in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, citing games in [[Sologne]], in [[Toulon]], and more generally throughout the Mediterranean coast. On the [[Languedoc]] coast in Southern France, jousts have been practised regularly since the seventeenth century. There is evidence that the inauguration of the port of [[Sete]] in 1666 gave rise to a jousting tournament. In the [[Rhone-Alps]] region, it was reported  13 April 1507 that the fishermen of St Vincent (Lyon) jousted on the [[Saône]] at St. Jean to entertain Queen [[Anne of Brittany]] and her people.  In 1536, a show of jousting is given by the sailors in [[Saint-Just-Saint-Rambert]] (Loire), in honour of [[Francis I of France|François I]]. Games are also held on the Saône in 1548 for [[Henry II of France|Henri II]] and [[Catherine of Medici]].

The nineteenth century was a watershed in the history of jousting on the Rhone with the creation of certain societies. The original object of these societies was not primarily concerned with the practice of jousting. Rather, they were societies of sailors who came together to bring relief to residents during the frequent floods of the Rhone. They practised jousting at local festivals, thus perpetuating the tradition passed down from generation to generation by these proud watermen.

In 1899, the Federal Union of French Societies of Swimming and Rescue was created. The Union will hold the first jousting championship in France in 1901 on the Tête d'or Lake in Lyon, albeit this was somewhat rudimentary. In 1905, the Union is replaced by the National Federation of Swimming and Rescue, which also holds regional championships.

A French postage stamp depicting water jousting was issued in 1958.

It was not until 1960 that the game was officially recognized as a sport by the government. The current federation (Federation of French Jousting and Water Rescue) was born in 1964 following a strong disagreement with the former federation, which did not sufficiently develop the game as a sport.

The sport is currently practised throughout France, notably in Languedoc, [[Provence]], the [[Rhone Valley]], around [[Paris]] and in [[Alsace]]. Jousting festivals are also held in [[Cognac, France|Cognac]], [[Accolay, Yonne|Accolay]], [[Merville, Nord|Merville]] and in [[Brittany]]. Each region has its own methods of jousting and its own rules of engagement.

The '''Winston-Salem Fairgrounds Annex''' (formerly named the '''LJVM Coliseum Annex''') is a 4,000-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]]. It was built in 1989.  It was formerly home to the [[Winston-Salem Thunderbirds]], [[Winston-Salem Mammoths]], [[Winston-Salem Icehawks]], [[Winston-Salem T-Birds]], [[Winston-Salem Polar Twins]], and [[Twin City Cyclones]] [[ice hockey]] teams. It also serves as an occasional concert venue, hosting [[Bob Dylan]] on two occasions, in 1991 and 2002.

It was part of the [[Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum]], which used to be part of the larger [[Winston-Salem Sports and Entertainment Complex]], and was named the LJVM Coliseum Annex. In 2013, the city sold the Coliseum to [[Wake Forest University]] and renamed the complex and smaller arena to Winston-Salem Fairgrounds in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wfdd.org/story/fairground-gets-new-name |title=Fairground Gets New Name |publisher=[[WFDD]] |date=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located adjacent to the [[Dixie Classic Fair]]grounds.

The Winston-Salem Fairgrounds Annex was home to the [[Winston Wildcats]], an [[Indoor American football|indoor football]] team that was part of [[American Indoor Football]] and is now an independent.

Since 2017, it has been home to the [[Carolina Thunderbirds (FHL)|Carolina Thunderbirds]], a minor league hockey team in the [[Federal Hockey League]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.federalhockey.com/news/fhl-formally-approves-expansion-to-winston-salem-n&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summary and brawl===
According to regulation of [[Chinese FA Cup]], only native player could play in this match. Without [[Alex Teixeira]], [[Ramires]], [[Jô]], [[Sammir]] and [[Trent Sainsbury]], Jiangsu Suning found it hard to fashion a goal-scoring chance with Wuhan Hongxing's intense defense and time-wasting technique. [[Dan Petrescu]], manager of Jiangsu Suning, was sent off to stand in the 69th minute due to objecting Wuhan Hongxing's time-wasting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mt.sohu.com/20160511/n448947948.shtml 足协杯:佩帅被罚戈伟补时8分钟绝杀 苏宁1-0最牛村队]&lt;/ref&gt; Wuhan Hongxing also received numerous yellow cards and hoped to make the match go into the penalty shoot-out. However, Jiangsu's 2-meter high striker [[Ge Wei]], who came on as a substitute in the second half, scored in the 7th minute of stoppage time as Jiangsu edged Wuhan Hongxing 1–0 and advanced to the next round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.qq.com/a/20160511/058298.htm 足协杯-苏宁1-0淘汰最牛村队 戈伟98分钟绝杀]&lt;/ref&gt;

Players and staff of Wuhan Hongxing lost control and attacked their counterparts following the final whistle. Jiangsu's [[Xie Pengfei]] was hit onto the ground by several Wuhan players, while scorer Ge Wei was injured on his rib with scratches; Many other Jiangsu's players also suffered injuries in the melee.&lt;ref name="china.org"&gt;[http://china.org.cn/sports/2016-05/11/content_38434684.htm Violent brawl stuns Chinese FA Cup]&lt;/ref&gt; Some reporters from Jiangsu were also assaulted in the incident.

"''Wushu"'' is the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] term for "martial arts" (武 "Wu" = military or martial, 術 "Shu" = art). In contemporary times, Wushu has become an [[international]] sport through the [[International Wushu Federation]] (IWUF), which holds the [[World Wushu Championships]] every two years; the first World Championships were held in 1991 in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Competitive Wushu is composed of two disciplines: [[Taolu (martial arts)|taolu (套路; ''forms'')]] and [[sanshou|sanda]] (散打; [[sparring]]). But it has other disciplines, like self defense, breaking hard objects, and other related practices, that are not performed in competitions.

Taolu involves [[martial art]] patterns, acrobatic movements and techniques for which competitors are judged and given points according to specific rules. The forms comprise basic movements (stances, kicks, punches, balances, jumps, sweeps, and throws) based on aggregate categories of traditional Chinese martial art styles, and can be changed for competitions to highlight one's strengths. Competitive forms have time limits that can range from 1 minute, 20 seconds for some external styles, to over five minutes for internal styles.

[[sanshou|Sanda]] (sometimes called [[sanshou]]) is a modern fighting method and a full contact sport. Sanda contains [[boxing]], kicks ([[kickboxing]]), and [[wrestling]]. It has all the combat aspects of wushu. Sanda appears much like [[Kickboxing]], [[MMA]], [[Boxing]] or [[Muay Thai]], but includes many more grappling techniques. Sanda fighting competitions are often held alongside taolu.

==History==
In 1958, the government established the All-China Wushu Association as an umbrella organization to regulate martial arts training.  The Chinese State Commission for Physical Culture and Sports took the lead in creating standardized forms for most of the major arts.  During this period, a national Wushu system that included standard forms, teaching curriculum, and instructor grading was established. Wushu was introduced at both the high school and university level. This new system seeks to incorporate common elements from all styles and forms as well as the general ideas associated with Chinese martial arts.  Stylistic concepts such as hard, soft, internal, external, as well as classifications based on schools such as Shaolin, Taiji, Wudang and others were all integrated into one system.  Wushu became the government sponsored standard for the training in martial arts in China.&lt;ref name=Lorge &gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Lorge | first1 = Peter  | title = Chinese Martial Arts From Antiquity to the Twenty-First Century | year =2012  | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge  | isbn = 978-0-521-87881-4  | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The push for standardization continued leading to widespread adaptation.  In 1979, the State Commission for Physical Culture and Sports created a special task force to  teaching and practice of Wushu. In 1986, the Chinese National Research Institute of Wushu was established as the central authority for the research and administration of Wushu activities in China.&lt;ref&gt;Wu Bin, Li xingdong and Yu Gongbao(1992), "Essentials of Chinese Wushu", Foreign Language Press, Beijing, {{ISBN|7-119-01477-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changing government policies and attitudes towards sports in general lead to the closing of the [[State Sports Commission]] (the central sports authority) in 1998.  This closure is viewed as an attempt to partially de-politicize organized sports and move Chinese sport policies towards a more [[Market (economics)|market]]-driven approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Riordan|first=Jim|year=1999|title=Sport and Physical Education in China|publisher=Spon Press (UK)|isbn=0-419-24750-5}} p.15&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these changing sociological factors within China, both traditional styles and modern Wushu approaches are being promoted by the [[International Wushu Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Contemporary taolu events==
[[File:10th all china games Jian pair 406 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A [[Jian]] dual event (choreographed)]]
Wushu events are performed using compulsory or individual routines in competition.  Compulsory routines are those routines that have been already created for the athlete, resulting in each athlete performing basically the same set.  Individual routines are routines that an athlete creates with the aid of his/her coach, while following certain rules for difficulty.

In addition to events for '''individual routines''', some wushu competitions also feature dual and group events. The '''dual event''', also called duilian (对练), is an event in which there is some form of sparring with weapons, or without weapons or even using bare hands against weapons. The dual event is usually spectacular and actions are choreographed beforehand. The '''group event''', also known as jiti (集體), requires a group of people to perform together and smooth synchronization of actions are crucial. Usually, the group event also allows instrumental music to accompany the choreography during the performance. The carpet used for the group event is also larger than the one used for individual routines.

Previously, international wushu competitions most often used compulsory routines, while high-level competitions in China most often used individual routines. However, after the 2003 Wushu World Games in [[Macau]] it was decided to opt for individual routines in international competition with '''nandu''' (難度; difficulty movements) integrating a maximum 2 point nandu score into the overall maximum score of 10.

There is some controversy concerning the inclusion of nandu in wushu because many of the movements created for the specific events are not originally movements used in those styles.  In addition the number of injuries which have resulted from the inclusion of these nandu have caused many people to question their inclusion.

Those who support the new difficulty requirements follow the assertion that they help to progress the sport and improve the overall physical quality of the athletes.

===Barehanded===
'''[[Chángquán]]''' (長拳 or [[Long Fist]]) refers to long-range extended wushu styles like [[Chāquán]] (查拳), [[Huaquan]] (華拳), Hongquan (洪拳; "flood fist"), and [[Shaolinquan]] (少林拳), but this wushu form is a modernized style derived from movements of these and other traditional styles.  [[Changquan]] is the most widely seen of the wushu forms, and includes speed, power, accuracy, and flexibility.  Changquan is difficult to perform, requiring great flexibility and athleticism, and is often practiced from a young age. All nandu movements must be made within 4 steps or it will not count for nandu points.

'''[[Nanquan]]''' (南拳 or [[Southern Fist]]) refers to wushu styles originating in south [[China]] (i.e., south of the [[Yangtze River]], including [[Hung Gar|Hongjiaquan]] (Hung Gar) (洪家拳), [[Choy Lay Fut|Cailifoquan]] (Choy Li Fut) (蔡李佛拳), and [[Wing Chun|Yongchunquan]] (Wing Chun) (詠春拳).  Many are known for vigorous, athletic movements with very stable, low stances and intricate hand movements.  This wushu form is a modern style derived from movements of these and other traditional southern styles.  [[Nanquan]] typically requires less flexibility and has fewer acrobatics than [[Changquan]], but it also requires greater leg stability and power generation through leg and hip coordination.  This event was created in 1960. All nandu movements must be made within 4 steps or it will not count for nandu points.

'''[[Taijiquan]]''' (太極拳, [[T'ai Chi Ch'uan]]) is a wushu style mistakenly famous for slow, relaxed movements, often seen as an exercise method for the elderly, and sometimes known as "T'ai chi" in Western countries to those otherwise unfamiliar with wushu. This wushu form (42 form) is a modern recompilation based on the [[Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Yang]] (楊) style of [[Taijiquan]], but also including movements of the [[Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Chen]] (陳), [[Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Wu]] (吳), [[Wu (Hao)-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Wu]] (武), and [[Sun-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Sun]] (孫) styles. Competitive contemporary taiji is distinct from the traditional first form for styles it draws from, in that it typically involves difficult holds, balances, jumps and jump kicks. Modern competitive taiji requires good balance, flexibility and strength. The traditional second forms however like cannon fist, are more difficult than the modern forms, But less known and usually taught to advanced students.

===Short weapons===
[[File:Wushu dao.jpg|thumb|A dao]]
'''[[Dao (broadsword)|Dao]]''' (刀 or [[broadsword]]) refers to any curved, one-sided sword/blade, but this wushu form is a [[Changquan]] method of using a medium-sized willow-leaf-shaped [[Dao (sword)|dao]] (柳葉刀).

'''[[Nandao]]''' (南刀 or [[Southern Style broadsword]]) refers to a form performed with a curved, one sided sword/blade based on the techniques of Nanquan.  The weapon and techniques appears to be based on the [[butterfly sword]]s of [[Yongchunquan]], a well known Southern style.  In the Wushu form, the blade has been lengthened and changed so that only one is used (as opposed to a pair).  This event was created in 1992.

'''[[Jian]]''' (劍 or [[sword]]) refers to any double-edged straight sword/blade, but this wushu form is a [[Changquan]] method of using the [[jian]].

'''[[Taijijian]]''' (太極劍 or [[Taiji]] sword) is an event using the [[jian]] based on traditional [[Taijiquan]] jian methods.

===Long weapons===
'''[[Gun (staff)|Gun]]''' (棍 or cudgel) refers to a long staff (shaped from [[white wax wood]]) as tall as the wrist of a person standing with his or her arms stretched upwards, but this wushu form is a [[Changquan]] method of using the white wax wood staff.

'''[[Nangun]]''' (南棍 or [[Southern cudgel]]) is a [[Nanquan]] method of using the staff. This event was created in 1992. A Nangun should be as tall as a person holding a fist above his head. There are several basic steps and techniques that must be included in an Optional Southern cudgel event. The basic steps are bow stance, empty stance, dragon riding stance (弓步、虛步、騎龍步).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.olympic.cn/china_oly/culture_art/2003-11-27/19183.html|title=Wushu Glossary|last=|first=|date=|website=Official Website of the Chinese Olympic Committee|access-date=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic techniques in Southern Cudgel are cleft stick, collapse stick, twisted stick, roll press stick, defend stick, hit stick, uphold stick, throw stick (劈棍、崩棍、絞棍、滾壓棍、格 棍、擊棍、頂棍、拋棍).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iwuf.org/upload/2015/0206/fe60942905b4f42894d407ce8d3c54581e19e9d2.pdf|title=Rules for International Wushu Taolu Competition (International Wushu Federation)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Qiang (spear)|Qiang]]''' (槍 or [[spear]]) refers to a flexible spear with red horse hair attached to the spearhead, but this wushu form is a [[Changquan]] method of using the [[qiang (spear)|qiang]].

==Other taolu routines==
The majority of routines used in the sport are new, modernized recompilations of traditional routines.  However, routines taken directly from traditional styles, including the styles that are not part of standard events, may be performed in competition, especially in China.  These routines generally do not garner as many points as their modern counterparts, and are performed in events separate from the compulsory routine events.  Among these, the more commonly seen routines include:

==Sanda (sparring)==
The other major discipline of contemporary Chinese Wushu is 散打 Sǎndǎ, or 运动散打 (Yùndòng Sǎndǎ, Sport Free-Fighting), or 竞争散打 (Jìngzhēng Sàndǎ, Competitive Free-Fighting): A modern fighting method, sport, and applicable component of Wushu / Kung Fu influenced by traditional Chinese Boxing, of which takedowns &amp; throws are legal in competition, as well as all other sorts of striking (use of arms &amp; legs). Chinese wrestling methods called Shuai Jiao and other Chinese grappling techniques such as Chin Na. It has all the combat aspects of wushu.

Sanda appears much like Kickboxing or Muay Thai, but includes many more grappling techniques. Sanda fighting competitions are often held alongside taolu or form competitions. Sanda represents the modern development of Lei Tai contests, but with rules in place to reduce the chance of serious injury. Many Chinese martial art schools teach or work within the rule sets of Sanda, working to incorporate the movements, characteristics, and theory of their style.

Chinese martial artists also compete in non-Chinese or mixed combat sports, including Boxing, Kickboxing and Mixed Martial Arts.[6] Sanda is practiced in tournaments and is normally held alongside taolu events in wushu competition. For safety reasons, some techniques from the self-defense form such as elbow strikes, chokes, and joint locks, are not allowed during tournaments. Competitors can win by knockout or points which are earned by landing strikes to the body or head, throwing an opponent, or when competition is held on a raised lei tai platform, pushing them off the platform. Fighters are only allowed to clinch for a few seconds. If the clinch is not broken by the fighters, and if neither succeeds in throwing his opponent within the time limit, the referee will break the clinch. In the U.S., competitions are held either in boxing rings or on the raised lei tai platform. Amateur fighters wear protective gear.

"Amateur Sanda" allows kicks, punches and throws. A competition held in China, called the "King of Sanda", is held in a ring similar to a boxing ring in design but larger in dimension. As professionals, they wear no protective gear except for gloves, cup, and mouthpiece, and "Professional Sanda" allows knee and elbow strikes (including to the head) as well as kicking, punching and throwing.

Some Sanda fighters have participated in fighting tournaments such as K-1 , [[Muay Thai]],  [[Boxing]] and Shoot Boxing. They have had some degree of success, especially in Shoot boxing competitions, which is more similar to Sanda. Due to the rules of Kickboxing competition, Sanda fighters are subjected to more limitations than usual. Also notable competitors in China's mainstream Mixed Martial Arts competitions, Art of War Fighting Championship and Ranik Ultimate Fighting Federation are dominantly of wushu background. Sanda has been featured in many style-versus-style competitions. Muay Thai is frequently pitted against Sanda as is Karate, Kickboxing, &amp; Tae Kwon Do. Although it is less common, some Sanda practitioners have also fought in the publicly viewed American Mixed Martial Arts competitions.

==Competitions==
Major international and regional competitions featuring wushu include:
* [[World Wushu Championships]]
* [[World Junior Wushu Championships]]
* [[World Games]]
* [[World Combat Games]]
* [[Asian Games]]
* [[East Asian Games]]

Wushu is not a [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympic]] [[Olympic sports|sport]]; the IWUF has repeatedly backed proposals for Wushu to be added to the Olympic programme, most recently as one of eight sports proposed for the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]], Japan. However, it failed to reach the final shortlist, and the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) ultimately voted for the re-inclusion of [[Wrestling at the Summer Olympics|wrestling]] instead. Wushu was formally introduced into the Olympics as an exhibition sport in Berlin, in 1936, under Chancellor Hitler's request. In March 2015, IWUF executive vice president Anthony Goh stated that the Federation was planning to propose Wushu again for the [[2024 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name=atlantic-sportsofthefuture&gt;{{cite web|title=The Summer Olympic Sports of the Future|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/08/the-summer-olympic-sports-of-the-future/260982/|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wushu eyes slot for 2024|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/03/06/wushu-eyes-slot-2024-olympics.html|website=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="International outrage on IOC's decision to drop wrestling from the 2020 Olympic Games"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/olympics/wrestling/story/_/id/8939185/ioc-drops-wrestling-2020-olympics|title=IOC drops wrestling from 2020 Olympics|last=Staff|date=14 February 2013|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of new IOC rules allowing host committees to accept proposals for new sports to be added to the programme (allowing the addition of sports of local interest to the Olympic programme under an "event-based" model), in June 2015, Wushu was shortlisted again as part of eight sports proposed for inclusion in the 2020 Games in this manner.&lt;ref name=bbcsport-wushu2020&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic Games: Snooker misses out on 2020 Tokyo place|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/olympics/33223492|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it did not make the final shortlist of five.&lt;ref name="bbc-fivenew"&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympics: Skateboarding &amp; surfing among possible Tokyo 2020 sports|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/34337877|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Wushu has faced criticism as a competitive sport. It has been criticized by some traditional martial artists for being too commercialized, losing many of its original values, and potentially threatening old styles of teaching. Such critics argue that contemporary wushu helped to create a dichotomy between form work and combat application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= China Gets the Gold!
