'''Adi''' ([[Skt.]], 'first') is a Hindu, Buddhist, and Theosophical term meaning the first part of reality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], ''A Textbook of Theosophy'', Madras, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; It has to do with the [[first cause]] or even [[causeless cause|Adi-Ananta]]—at least as unity of infinity (as Plotinus and others say) emanating the first finite one.  This is called [[Brahman#Semantics and pronunciation|Brahm]] (in Hinduism) and [[Adi-Buddha]], and Theosophy also says it has to do with the [[divinity|Divine]] [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]], e.g. [[Logos]].

According to ancient and [[History of science in the Middle Ages|medieval science]], '''aether''' ({{lang-grc|αἰθήρ}}, ''aither''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=ether |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=4th |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=2006 |isbn=978-0618701728 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), also spelled '''æther''' or '''ether''' and also called '''quintessence''', is the material that fills the region of the [[universe]] above the [[Sublunary sphere|terrestrial sphere]].&lt;ref name="smoot" /&gt; The concept of aether was used in several theories to explain several natural phenomena, such as the traveling of light and gravity. In the late 19th century, physicists postulated that aether permeated all throughout space, providing a medium through which light could travel in a [[vacuum]], but evidence for the presence of such a medium was not found in the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]], and this result has been interpreted as meaning that no such [[luminiferous aether]] exists.&lt;ref&gt;Carl S. Helrich, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aRpJJXc-LCIC&amp;pg=PA26 ''The Classical Theory of Fields: Electromagnetism''] Berlin, Springer 2012, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythological origins==
{{main|Aether (mythology)}}
{{see also|Empyrean}}
The word  {{lang|grc|αἰθήρ}} (''aithēr'') in [[Homeric Greek]] means "pure, fresh air" or "clear sky". In [[Greek mythology]], it was thought to be the pure essence that the gods breathed, filling the space where they lived, analogous to the ''[[Air (classical element)|air]]'' breathed by mortals.&lt;ref name="gm.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Aether/aether.html |title=Aether |publisher=GreekMythology.com |accessdate=20 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220225142/http://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Aether/aether.html |archivedate=20 December 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also personified as a deity, [[Aether (mythology)|Aether]], the son of [[Erebus]] and [[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]] in traditional Greek mythology.&lt;ref name="gm.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Aither.html|title = AITHER|date = |access-date = January 16, 2016|website = AETHER : Greek protogenos god of upper air &amp; light ; mythology : AITHER|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aether is related to {{lang|grc|αἴθω}} "to incinerate",&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Pokorny|Pokorny, Julius]] (1959).

''ai-dh-.''&lt;/ref&gt; and intransitive "to burn, to shine" (related is the name ''Aithiopes'' ([[Ethiopia]]ns; see [[Aethiopia]]), meaning "people with a burnt (black) visage").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*ai%29qi%2Foy Αἰθίοψ] in Liddell, Scott, ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]'': "Αἰθίοψ , οπος, ὁ, fem.

==Fifth element==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Classical element]] --&gt;
[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|Medieval concept of the cosmos. The innermost spheres are the terrestrial spheres, while the outer are made of aether and contain the celestial bodies]]
In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (58d) speaking about air, Plato mentions that "there is the most translucent kind which is called by the name of aether (αίθηρ)".&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]],  ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=1C8F72843B9D65CB4C634D700A6E694C?doc=Plat.+Tim.+58d 58d].&lt;/ref&gt; but otherwise he adopted the classical system of four elements. [[Aristotle]], who had been Plato's student at the [[Akademia]], agreed on this point with his former mentor, emphasizing additionally that fire sometimes has been mistaken for aether. However, in his Book ''[[On the Heavens]]'' he introduced a new "first" element to the system of the [[classical element]]s of [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian]] [[Greek philosophy|philosophy]]. He noted that the four terrestrial classical elements were subject to change and naturally moved linearly. The first element however, located in the celestial regions and heavenly bodies, moved circularly and had none of the qualities the terrestrial classical elements had. It was neither hot nor cold, neither wet nor dry. With this addition the system of elements was extended to five and later commentators started referring to the new first one as the fifth and also called it ''aether'', a word that Aristotle had not used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hahm |first1=David E. |title=The fifth element in Aristotle's ''De Philosophia'': A Critical Re-Examination |journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies |date=1982 |volume=102 |pages=60–74 |doi=10.2307/631126|jstor=631126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aether did not follow [[Aristotelian physics]] either. Aether was also incapable of motion of quality or motion of quantity. Aether was only capable of local motion. Aether naturally moved in circles, and had no contrary, or unnatural, motion.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. E. R. Lloyd]]), ''Aristotle: The Growth and Structure of his Thought'', Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1968, pp. 133-139, {{ISBN|0-521-09456-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle also noted that crystalline spheres made of aether held the celestial bodies. The idea of crystalline spheres and natural circular motion of aether led to Aristotle's explanation of the observed orbits of stars and planets in perfectly circular motion in crystalline aether.&lt;ref name="smoot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aether.lbl.gov/www/classes/p10/aristotle-physics.html |title=Aristotle's Physics |author=George Smoot III |website=lbl.gov |accessdate=20 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220230803/http://aether.lbl.gov/www/classes/p10/aristotle-physics.html |archivedate=20 December 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval scholastic philosophers granted ''aether'' changes of density, in which the bodies of the planets were considered to be more dense than the medium which filled the rest of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Edward|title=Planets, Stars, &amp; Orbs: The Medieval Cosmos, 1200-1687|date=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [England]|isbn=978-0-521-56509-7|pages=322–428|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Fludd]] stated that the aether was of the character that it was "subtler than light". Fludd cites the 3rd-century view of [[Plotinus]], concerning the aether as penetrative and non-material.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fludd, "Mosaical Philosophy". London, Humphrey Moseley, 1659. Pg 221.&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Arche]].

==Quintessence==
Quintessence is the [[Latinate]] name of the fifth element used by medieval alchemists for a medium similar or identical to that thought to make up the heavenly bodies. It was noted that there was very little presence of quintessence within the terrestrial sphere. Due to the low presence of quintessence, earth could be affected by what takes place within the heavenly bodies.&lt;ref name="TheAlchemists"&gt;''The Alchemists'', by F. Sherwood Taylor page 95&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was developed in the 14th century text ''The testament of Lullius'', attributed to [[Ramon Llull]]. The use of quintessence became popular within medieval alchemy. Quintessence stemmed from the medieval elemental system, which consisted of the four classical elements, and aether, or quintessence, in addition to two chemical elements representing metals: [[sulphur]], "the stone which burns", which characterized the principle of combustibility, and [[mercury (element)|mercury]], which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties.

This elemental system spread rapidly throughout all of Europe and became popular with alchemists, especially in medicinal alchemy. Medicinal alchemy then sought to isolate quintessence and incorporate it within medicine and elixirs.&lt;ref name="TheAlchemists" /&gt; Due to quintessence's pure and heavenly quality, it was thought that through consumption one may rid oneself of any impurities or illnesses. In ''The book of Quintessence'', a 15th-century English translation of a continental text, quintessence was used as a medicine for many of man's illnesses. A process given for the creation of quintessence is [[distillation]] of alcohol seven times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stavacademy.co.uk/mimir/quintessence.htm ''The book of Quintessence''], Early English Text society original series number 16, edited by F. J. Furnivall&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the term quintessence has become synonymous with [[elixirs]], medicinal [[alchemy]], and the [[philosopher's stone]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dictionary of Alchemy'', by Mark Haeffner&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
{{main|Aether theories}}
With the [[History of physics#18th-century developments|18th century physics developments]], physical models known as "aether theories" made use of a similar concept for the explanation of the propagation of electromagnetic and gravitational forces. As early as the 1670s, Newton used the idea of aether to help match observations to strict mechanical rules of his physics.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Osler, ''Reconfiguring the World.'' The Johns Hopkins University Press 2010. (155).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the early modern aether had little in common with the aether of classical elements from which the name was borrowed. These aether theories are considered to be scientifically obsolete, as the development of [[special relativity]] showed that Maxwell's equations do not require the aether for the transmission of these forces. However, Einstein himself noted that his own model which replaced these theories could itself be thought of as an aether, as it implied that the empty space between objects had its own physical properties.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert: "Ether and the Theory of Relativity" (1920), republished in Sidelights on Relativity (Methuen, London, 1922)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the early modern aether models being superseded by general relativity, occasionally some physicists have attempted to reintroduce the concept of aether in an attempt to address perceived deficiencies in current physical models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dirac | first1 = Paul | year = 1951 | title = Is there an Aether? | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 168 | issue = 4282| pages = 906–907 | doi=10.1038/168906a0|bibcode = 1951Natur.168..906D }}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed model of [[dark energy]] has been named "[[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]]" by its proponents, in honor of the classical element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zlatev | first1 = I. | last2 = Wang | first2 = L. | last3 = Steinhardt | first3 = P. | year = 1999 | title = Quintessence, Cosmic Coincidence, and the Cosmological Constant | url = http://cds.cern.ch/record/358722| journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 82 | issue = 5| pages = 896–899 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.82.896 | bibcode=1999PhRvL..82..896Z|arxiv = astro-ph/9807002 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea relates to the hypothecial form of dark energy postulated as an explanation of observations of an accelerating universe. It has also been called a [[Fifth force|fifth fundamental force]].

===Aether and light===
{{main|Luminiferous aether}}
The motion of light was a long-standing investigation in physics for hundreds of years before the 20th century. The use of aether to describe this motion was popular during the 17th and 18th centuries, including a theory proposed by [[Johann II Bernoulli]], who was recognized in 1736 with the prize of the French Academy. In his theory, all space is permeated by aether containing "excessively small whirlpools". These whirlpools allow for aether to have a certain elasticity, transmitting vibrations from the corpuscular packets of light as they travel through.&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, Edmund Taylor, ''A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity from the Age of Descartes to the Close of the 19th Century'' (1910), pp. 101-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory of [[luminiferous aether]] would influence the [[wave|wave theory]] of light proposed by [[Christiaan Huygens]], in which light traveled in the form of [[longitudinal waves]]  via an "omnipresent, perfectly elastic medium having zero density, called aether". At the time, it was thought that in order for light to travel through a vacuum, there must have been a medium filling the void through which it could propagate, as sound through air or ripples in a pool. Later, when it was proved that the nature of light wave is [[transverse wave|transverse]] instead of longitudinal, Huygens' theory was replaced by subsequent theories proposed by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] and [[Louis-Victor de Broglie|de Broglie]], which rejected the existence and necessity of aether to explain the various optical phenomena. These theories were supported by the results of the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] in which evidence for the motion of aether was conclusively absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Michelson |first=Albert A. |title=The Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether |journal = American Journal of Science |volume = 22 |issue=128 |year = 1881 |pages = 120–129 |doi=10.2475/ajs.s3-22.128.120|title-link=s:The Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether |bibcode=1881AmJS...22..120M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the experiment influenced many physicists of the time and contributed to the eventual development of Einstein's [[special relativity|theory of special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shankland | first1 = R. S. | year = 1964 | title = Michelson-Morley Experiment | url = | journal = American Journal of Physics | volume = 32 | issue = 1| page = 16 | doi = 10.1119/1.1970063 |bibcode = 1964AmJPh..32...16S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aether and gravitation===
[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumbnail|Sir Isaac Newton]]
Aether has been used in various gravitational theories as a medium to help explain gravitation and what causes it. It was used in one of Sir [[Isaac Newton]]'s first published theories of gravitation, ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (the ''Principia''). He based the whole description of planetary motions on a theoretical law of dynamic interactions. He renounced standing attempts at accounting for this particular form of interaction between distant bodies by introducing a mechanism of propagation through an intervening medium.&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld1969"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenfeld |first1=L. |title=Newton's views on aether and gravitation |journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences |date=1969 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=29–37 |doi=10.1007/BF00327261}}&lt;/ref&gt; He calls this intervening medium aether. In his aether model, Newton describes aether as a medium that "flows" continually downward toward the Earth's surface and is partially absorbed and partially diffused. This "circulation" of aether is what he associated the force of gravity with to help explain the action of gravity in a non-mechanical fashion.&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld1969"/&gt; This theory described different aether densities, creating an aether density gradient. His theory also explains that aether was dense within objects and rare without them. As particles of denser aether interacted with the rare aether they were attracted back to the dense aether much like cooling vapors of water are attracted back to each other to form water.&lt;ref name="newton1679"/&gt; In the ''Principia'' he attempts to explain the elasticity and movement of aether by relating aether to his static model of fluids. This elastic interaction is what caused the pull of gravity to take place, according to this early theory, and allowed an explanation for action at a distance instead of action through direct contact. Newton also explained this changing rarity and density of aether in his letter to [[Robert Boyle]] in 1679.&lt;ref name="newton1679"&gt;Newton, Isaac.[http://www.orgonelab.org/newtonletter.htm "Isaac Newton to Robert Boyle, 1679."] 28 February 1679.&lt;/ref&gt; He illustrated aether and its field around objects in this letter as well and used this as a way to inform Robert Boyle about his theory.&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orgonelab.org/newtonletter.htm |title=Isaac Newton's Letter to Robert Boyle, on the Cosmic Ether of Space - 1679 |author=James DeMeo |year=2009 |website=orgonelab.org |accessdate=20 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220231449/http://www.orgonelab.org/newtonletter.htm |archivedate=20 December 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Newton eventually changed his theory of gravitation to one involving force and the laws of motion, his starting point for the modern understanding and explanation of gravity came from his original aether model on gravitation.&lt;ref name="robishaw"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KkS9CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=newton+robert+boyle+aether#v=onepage&amp;q=newton%20robert%20boyle%20aether&amp;f=false |title=The Esoteric Codex: Esoteric Cosmology |author=Andrew Robishaw |page=6 |date=9 April 2015 |publisher=Lulu.com |accessdate=20 December 2016 |isbn=9781329053083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], '''being''' means the existence of a thing. Anything that exists has being. [[Ontology]] is the branch of philosophy that studies being. Being is a concept encompassing [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[Subjectivity|subjective]] features of [[reality]] and [[existence]]. Anything that partakes in being is also called a "being", though often this usage is limited to entities that have subjectivity (as in the expression "[[human being]]"). The notion of "being" has, inevitably, been elusive and controversial in the history of philosophy, beginning in Western philosophy with attempts among the [[pre-Socratics]] to deploy it intelligibly. The first effort to recognize and define the concept came from [[Parmenides]], who famously said of it that "what is-is". Common words such as "is", "are", and "am" refer directly or indirectly to being.

As an example of efforts in recent times, [[Martin Heidegger]] (who himself drew on ancient Greek sources) adopted after German terms like ''[[Dasein]]'' to articulate the topic.&lt;ref name="dasein1"&gt;Heidegger, the day  ''[[Being and Time|Sein und Zeit]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;27: "this entity which each of us is himself&amp;nbsp;... we shall denote by the term 'Dasein'."&lt;/ref&gt; Several modern approaches build on such continental European exemplars as Heidegger, and apply metaphysical results to the understanding of human psychology and the human condition generally (notably in the [[Existentialism|Existentialist]] tradition). By contrast, in mainstream [[Analytical philosophy]] the topic is more confined to abstract investigation, in the work of such influential theorists as [[W. V. O. Quine]], to name one of many. One of the most fundamental questions that continues to exercise philosophers is posed by [[William James]]: "How comes the world to be here at all instead of the nonentity which might be imagined in its place?&amp;nbsp;... from nothing to being there is no logical bridge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Some problems of philosophy: a beginning of an introduction to philosophy|first=William|last=James|authorlink=William James|pages=38, 40|year=1916|location=New York|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The substantial being==

===Being and the substance theorists===
The deficit of such a bridge was first encountered in history by the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic philosophers]] during the process of evolving a classification of all beings (noun). Aristotle, who wrote after the Pre-Socratics, applies the term [[Categories (Aristotle)|category]] (perhaps not originally) to ten highest-level classes. They comprise one category of substance ([[ousia]]e) existing independently (man, tree) and nine categories of accidents, which can only exist in something else (time, place). In Aristotle, substances are to be clarified by stating their [[definition]]: a note expressing a larger class (the genus) followed by further notes expressing [[Differentia|specific difference]]s (differentiae) within the class. The substance so defined was a species. For example, the species, man, may be defined as an animal (genus) that is rational (difference). As the difference is potential within the genus; that is, an animal may or may not be rational, the difference is not identical to, and may be distinct from, the genus.

Applied to being, the system fails to arrive at a definition for the simple reason that no difference can be found. The species, the genus, and the difference are all equally being: a being is a being that is being. The genus cannot be nothing because nothing is not a class of everything. The trivial solution that being is being added to nothing is only a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]: being is being. There is no simpler intermediary between being and non-being that explains and classifies being.

[[File:Being Parmenides.png|thumb|right|The Being according to [[Parmenides]] is like the mass of a sphere.]]
Pre-Socratic reaction to this deficit was varied. As [[Substance theory|substance theorists]] they accepted [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] the hypothesis that appearances are deceiving, that reality is to be reached through reasoning. [[Parmenides]] reasoned that if everything is identical to being and being is a category of the same thing then there can be neither differences between things nor any change. To be different, or to change, would amount to [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]] or being non-being; that is, not existing. Therefore, being is a homogeneous and non-differentiated sphere and the appearance of beings is illusory. [[Heraclitus]], on the other hand, foreshadowed modern thought by denying existence. Reality does not exist, it flows, and beings are an illusion upon the flow.

[[Aristotle]] knew of this tradition when he began his ''Metaphysics'', and had already drawn his own conclusion, which he presented under the guise of asking what being is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle|authorlink=Aristotle|title=[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]|chapter=Book VII Section 1 (paragraph 1028b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"And indeed the question which was raised of old is raised now and always, and is always the subject of doubt, viz., what being is, is just the question, what is substance? For it is this that some assert to be one, others more than one, and that some assert to be limited in number, others unlimited. And so we also must consider chiefly and primarily and almost exclusively what that is which is in this sense."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and reiterates in no uncertain terms:&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' Chapter VII, Section 4 (paragraph 1030a).&lt;/ref&gt; "Nothing, then, which is not a species of a genus will have an essence – only species will have it ....". Being, however, for Aristotle, is not a genus.

===Aristotle's theory of act and potency===
One might expect a solution to follow from such certain language but none does. Instead Aristotle launches into a rephrasing of the problem, the [[Potentiality and actuality|Theory of Act and Potency]]. In the definition of man as a two-legged animal Aristotle presumes that "two-legged" and "animal" are parts of other beings, but as far as man is concerned, are only potentially man. At the point where they are united into a single being, man, the being, becomes actual, or real. Unity is the basis of actuality:&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'', Book IX, Chapter 10 (paragraph 1051b).&lt;/ref&gt; "... 'being' is being combined and one, and 'not being' is being not combined but more than one." Actuality has taken the place of existence, but Aristotle is no longer seeking to know what the actual is; he accepts it without question as something generated from the potential. He has found a "half-being" or a "pre-being", the potency, which is fully being as part of some other substance. Substances, in Aristotle, unite what they actually are now with everything they might become.

==The transcendental being==
Some of Thomas Aquinas' propositions were reputedly condemned by Étienne Tempier, the local Bishop of Paris (not the Papal Magisterium itself) in 1270 and 1277,&lt;ref&gt;For text of condemnations 1277 (technically still 1276 at the date, since before 25 of March) see David Piché, La condemnation parisienne de 1277, [http://www.vrin.fr/html/main.htm?action=loadbook&amp;isbn=2711614166], parallel Latin text with his French translation, or online list Latin only with footnotes, by Hans-Georg Lundahl, [http://petitlien.com/tempier]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, William A. “Thomism and Its Opponents.” ''Dictionary of the Middle Ages''. Ed. Joseph R. Strayer. Vol. 12. New York: Scribner, 1982. 38–45. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; but his dedication to the use of philosophy to elucidate theology was so thorough that he was proclaimed a [[Doctor of the Church]] in 1568. Those who adopt it are called [[Thomism|Thomists]].

===Thomistic analogical predication of being===
In a single sentence, parallel to Aristotle's statement asserting that being is substance, St. Thomas pushes away from the Aristotelian doctrine:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The metaphysical thought of Thomas Aquinas: from finite being to uncreated being|first=John F. |last=Wippel|page=75|series=Monographs of the Society for Mediaeval and Renaissance Philosophy, No. 1|year=2000|publisher=The Catholic University of America Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Being is not a genus, since it is not predicated univocally but only analogically." His term for analogy is Latin ''analogia''. In the categorical classification of all beings, all substances are partly the same: man and chimpanzee are both animals and the animal part in man is "the same" as the animal part in chimpanzee. Most fundamentally all substances are matter, a theme taken up by science, which postulated one or more matters, such as earth, air, fire or water ([[Empedocles]]). In today's chemistry the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen in a chimpanzee are identical to the same elements in a man.

The original text reads, ''"Although equivocal predications must be reduced to univocal, still in actions, the non-univocal agent must precede the univocal agent. For the non-univocal agent is the universal cause of the whole species, as for instance the sun is the cause of the generation of all men; whereas the univocal agent is not the universal efficient cause of the whole species (otherwise it would be the cause of itself, since it is contained in the species), but is a particular cause of this individual which it places under the species by way of participation. Therefore the universal cause of the whole species is not an univocal agent; and the universal cause comes before the particular cause. But this universal agent, whilst it is not univocal, nevertheless is not altogether equivocal, otherwise it could not produce its own likeness, but rather it is to be called an analogical agent, as all univocal predications are reduced to one first non-univocal analogical predication, which is being."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1013.htm#article5|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The names of God (Prima Pars, Q. 13)|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If substance is the highest category and there is no substance, being, then the unity perceived in all beings by virtue of their existing must be viewed in another way. St. Thomas chose the analogy: all beings are like, or analogous to, each other in existing. This comparison is the basis of his Analogy of Being. The analogy is said of being in many different ways, but the key to it is the real distinction between existence and essence. Existence is the principle that gives reality to an essence not the same in any way as the existence: "If things having essences are real, and it is not of their essence to be, then the reality of these things must be found in some principle other than (really distinct from) their essence."&lt;ref name=Kreyche70&gt;{{harvnb|Kreyche|1959|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Substance can be real or not. What makes an individual substance – a man, a tree, a planet – real is a distinct act, a "to be", which actuates its unity. An analogy of proportion is therefore possible:&lt;ref name=Kreyche70/&gt; "essence is related to existence as potency is related to act."

Existences are not things; they do not themselves exist, they lend themselves to essences, which do not intrinsically have them. They have no nature; an existence receives its nature from the essence it actuates. Existence is not being; it gives being – here a customary phrase is used, existence is a principle (a source) of being, not a previous source, but one which is continually in effect. The stage is set for the concept of God as the cause of all existence, who, as the Almighty, holds everything actual without reason or explanation as an act purely of will.

===The transcendentals===
Aristotle's classificatory scheme had included the five [[predicables]], or characteristics that might be predicated of a substance. One of these was the [[Property (philosophy)|property]], an essential universal true of the species, but not in the definition (in modern terms, some examples would be grammatical language, a property of man, or a spectral pattern characteristic of an element, both of which are defined in other ways). Pointing out that predicables are predicated [[Univocity|univocally]] of substances; that is, they refer to "the same thing" found in each instance, St. Thomas argued that whatever can be said about being is not univocal, because all beings are unique, each actuated by a unique existence. It is the analogous possession of an existence that allows them to be identified as being; therefore, being is an analogous predication.

Whatever can be predicated of all things is universal-like but not universal, category-like but not a category. St. Thomas called them (perhaps not originally) the ''transcendentia'', "[[transcendentals]]", because they "climb above" the categories, just as being climbs above substance. Later academics also referred to them as "the properties of being."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A companion to metaphysics|editor-first=Jaegwon |editor-last=Kim|editor2-first=Ernest |editor2-last=Sosa|pages=21–22|series=Blackwell Companions to philosophy|year=1995|contribution=Aquinas, St. Thomas|first=Jan A.|last=Aersten}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number is generally three or four.

==Being in Islamic philosophy==
The nature of "being" has also been debated and explored in [[Islamic philosophy]], notably by [[Ibn Sina]] ([[Avicenna]]), [[Suhrawardi Maqtul|Suhrawardi]], and [[Mulla Sadra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/personalities/msadra/mulla_sadra.php|title=Iranian Personalities: Sadr Al-Din Mohammad Shirazi|author=|date=|website=www.iranchamber.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; [[Indo-European copula|A modern linguistic approach]] which notices that [[Persian language]] has exceptionally developed two kinds of "[[Indo-European copula|is]]"es, i.e. ''ast'' ("is", as a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]) and ''hast'' (as an existential "is") examines the linguistic properties of the two lexemes in the first place, then evaluates how the statements made by other languages with regard to ''being'' can stand the test of Persian frame of reference.

In this modern linguistic approach, it is noticed that the original language of the source, e.g. [[Greek language|Greek]] (like [[German language|German]] or [[French language|French]] or [[English language|English]]), has only one word for two concepts, ''ast'' and ''hast'', or, like [[Arabic language|Arabic]], has no word at all for either word. It therefore exploits the Persian ''hast'' (existential ''is'') versus ''ast'' (predicative ''is'' or [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]) to address both Western and Islamic ontological arguments on ''being'' and ''existence''.&lt;ref&gt;Toofan, M. ''Zabān ast yā hast?''(Language: is or exists?. Ketāb-e Tehran, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

This linguistic method shows the scope of confusion created by languages which cannot differentiate between existential be and copula. It manifests, for instance, that the main theme of [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s ''[[Being and Time]]'' is  ''astī'' (is-ness) rather than ''hastī'' (existence). When, in the beginning of his book, [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] claims that people always talk about existence in their everyday language, without knowing what it means, the example he resorts to is: "the sky ''is'' blue" which in Persian can be ONLY translated with the use of the copula ''ast'', and says nothing about ''being'' or ''existence''.

In the same manner, the linguistic method addresses the ontological works written in Arabic. Since [[Arabic language|Arabic]], like [[Latin]] in Europe, had become the official language of philosophical and scientific works in the so-called Islamic World, the early Persian or Arab philosophers had difficulty discussing ''being'' or ''existence'', since the [[Arabic language]], like other Semitic languages, had no verb for either predicative "be" ([[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]) or existential "be". So if you try to translate the aforementioned [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s example into Arabic it appears as السماء زرقاء (viz. "The Sky-- blue") with no linking "is" to be a sign of existential statement. To overcome the problem, when translating the [[ancient Greek philosophy]], certain words were coined like ایس ''aysa'' (from Arabic لیس ''laysa'' 'not') for '[[Indo-European copula|is]]'. Eventually the Arabic verb وجد ''wajada'' (to find) prevailed, since it was thought that whatever is existent, is to be "''found''" in the world. Hence ''existence'' or Being was called وجود ''wujud'' (Cf. [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''finns'' [found]&gt; there exist; also the [[Medieval Latin]] coinage of ''exsistere'' 'standing out (there in the world)' &gt; appear&gt; exist).&lt;br /&gt;  Now, with regard to the fact that Persian, as the mother tongue of both [[Avicenna]] and [[Mulla Sadra|Sadrā]], was in conflict with either Greek or Arabic in this regard, these philosophers should have been warned implicitly by their mother tongue not to confuse two kinds of linguistic beings (viz. [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] vs. existential). In fact when analyzed thoroughly, [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], or Persian ''ast'' ('is') indicates an ever-moving chain of relations with no fixed ''entity'' to hold onto (every ''entity'', say A, will be dissolved into "A is B" and so on, as soon as one tries to define it). Therefore, the whole reality or what we see as existence ("found" in our world) resembles an ever-changing world of ''astī'' (is-ness) flowing in time and space. On the other hand, while Persian ''ast''  can be considered as the 3rd person singular of the verb 'to be', there is no verb but an arbitrary one supporting ''hast'' ('is' as an existential be= exists) has neither future nor past tense and nor a negative form of its own: ''hast'' is just a single untouchable lexeme. It needs no other linguistic element to be complete (''Hast.'' is a complete sentence meaning "s/he it exists"). In fact, any manipulation of the arbitrary verb, e.g. its conjugation, turns ''hast'' back into a copula.

Eventually from such linguistic analyses, it appears that while ''astī'' (is-ness) would resemble the world of [[Heraclitus]], ''hastī'' (existence) would rather approaches a metaphysical concept resembling the [[Parmenides|Parmenidas]]'s interpretation of ''existence''.

In this regard, [[Avicenna]], who was a firm follower of [[Aristotle]], could not accept either Heraclitian ''is-ness'' (where only constant was ''change''), nor Parmenidean ''monist immoveable existence'' (the ''hastī'' itself being constant). To solve the contradiction, it so appeared to Philosophers of Islamic world that [[Aristotle]] considered the core of existence (i.e. its ''[[Substance theory|substance]]''/''[[essence]]'') as a fixed constant, while its facade ([[Accident (philosophy)|accident]]) was prone to change. To translate such a philosophical image into Persian it is like having ''hastī'' (existence) as a unique constant core covered by ''astī'' (is-ness) as a cloud of ever-changing relationships. It is clear that the Persian language, deconstructs such a composite as a sheer mirage, since it is not clear how to link the interior core (existence) with the exterior shell (is-ness). Furthermore, ''hast'' cannot be linked to anything but itself (as it is self-referent).

The argument has a theological echos as well: assuming that God is the ''Existence'', beyond time and space, a question is raised by philosophers of the Islamic world as how he, as a transcendental existence, may ever create or contact a world of ''is-ness'' in space-time.

However, [[Avicenna]] who was more philosopher than theologian, followed the same line of argumentation as that of his ancient master, [[Aristotle]], and tried to reconcile between ''ast'' and ''hast'', by considering the latter as higher order of existence than the former. It is like a hierarchical order of existence. It was a philosophical [[Tower of Babel]] that the restriction of his own mother tongue (Persian) would not allow to be built, but he could maneuver in Arabic by giving the two concepts the same name ''wujud'', although with different attributes. So, implicitly, ''astī'' (is-ness) appears as ممکن الوجود "momken-al-wujud" (contingent being), and ''hastī'' (existence) as واجب الوجود "wājeb-al-wujud" (necessary being).

On the other hand, centuries later, [[Mulla Sadra|Sadrā]], chose a more radical route, by inclining towards the reality of ''astī'' (is-ness),  as the true mode of existence, and tried to get rid of the concept of ''hastī'' (existence as fixed or immovable). Thus, in his philosophy, the universal movement penetrates deep into the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] ''[[Substance theory|substance]]''/''[[essence]]'',  in unison with changing [[Accident (philosophy)|accident]].  He called this deep existential change حرکت جوهری ''harekat-e jowhari'' (Substantial Movement). In such a changing existence, the whole world has to go through instantaneous annihilation and recreation incessantly, while as [[Avicenna]] had predicted in his remarks on Nature, such a universal change or substantial movement would eventually entail the shortening and lengthening of time as well which has never been observed. This logical objection, which was made on Aristotle's argumentation, could not be answered in the ancient times or medieval age, but now it does not sound contradictory to the real nature of Time (as addressed in relativity theory), so by a reverse argument, a philosopher may indeed deduce that everything is changing (moving) even in the deepest core of Being.

==Being in the Age of Reason==
Although innovated in the late [[medieval]] period, Thomism was dogmatized in the [[Renaissance]]. From roughly 1277 to 1567, it dominated the philosophic landscape. The [[rationalist]] philosophers, however, with a new emphasis on [[Reason]] as a tool of the intellect, brought the classical and medieval traditions under new scrutiny, exercising a new concept of [[doubt]], with varying outcomes. Foremost among the new doubters were the [[Empiricism|empiricists]], the advocates of [[scientific method]], with its emphasis on [[experiment]]ation and reliance on evidence gathered from sensory experience. In parallel with the [[revolution]]s against rising political [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]] based on [[established religion]] and the replacement of [[faith]] by reasonable faith, new systems of metaphysics were promulgated in the lecture halls by charismatic professors, such as [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Hegel]]. The late 19th and 20th centuries featured an emotional return to the concept of existence under the name of [[existentialism]]. These philosophers were concerned mainly with ethics and religion. The metaphysical side became the domain of the [[phenomenalism|phenomenalists]]. In parallel with these philosophies Thomism continued under the protection of the Catholic Church; in particular, the [[Jesuit order]].

===Empiricist doubts===
[[Rationalism]] and [[empiricism]] have had many definitions, most concerned with specific schools of philosophy or groups of philosophers in particular countries, such as Germany. In general rationalism is the predominant school of thought in the multi-national, cross-cultural [[Age of reason]], which began in the century straddling 1600 as a conventional date,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=age of reason|encyclopedia=dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/age+of+reason|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; empiricism is the reliance on sensory data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=empiricism|encyclopedia=dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/empiricism|accessdate=9 January 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090125191857/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/empiricism| archivedate= 25 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; gathered in experimentation by scientists of any country, who, in the Age of Reason were rationalists. An early professed empiricist, [[Thomas Hobbes]], known as an eccentric denizen of the court of [[Charles II of England]] (an "old bear"), published in 1651 ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', a political treatise written during the [[English civil war]], containing an early [[manifesto]] in English of rationalism.
Hobbes said:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|pp=18, 21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Latines called Accounts of mony Rationes ... and thence it seems to proceed that they extended the word Ratio, to the faculty of Reckoning in all other things....When a man reasoneth hee does nothing else but conceive a summe totall ... For Reason ... is nothing but Reckoning ... of the consequences of generall names agreed upon, for the marking and signifying of our thoughts ...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In Hobbes reasoning is the right process of drawing conclusions from definitions (the "names agreed upon"). He goes on to define error as self-contradiction of definition ("an absurdity, or senselesse Speech"&lt;ref name=hobbes23&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or conclusions that do not follow the definitions on which they are supposed to be based. Science, on the other hand, is the outcome of "right reasoning," which is based on "natural sense and imagination", a kind of sensitivity to nature, as "nature it selfe cannot erre."

Having chosen his ground carefully Hobbes launches an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] attack on [[metaphysics]]. The academic philosophers had arrived at the [[Hylomorphism (Aristotelian)|Theory of Matter and Form]] from consideration of certain natural [[paradox]]es subsumed under the general heading of the Unity Problem. For example, a body appears to be one thing and yet it is distributed into many parts. Which is it, one or many? Aristotle had arrived at the real distinction between [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]] and [[Substantial form|form]], metaphysical components whose interpenetration produces the paradox. The whole unity comes from the substantial form and the distribution into parts from the matter. Inhering in the parts giving them really distinct unities are the [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental forms]]. The unity of the whole being is actuated by another really distinct principle, the existence.

If nature cannot err, then there are no paradoxes in it; to Hobbes, the paradox is a form of the absurd, which is inconsistency:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Natural sense and imagination, are not subject to absurdity" and "For error is but a deception ... But when we make a generall assertion, unlesse it be a true one, the possibility of it is inconceivable. And words whereby we conceive nothing but the sound, are those we call Absurd ...." Among Hobbes examples are "round quadrangle", "immaterial substance", "free subject."&lt;ref name=hobbes23/&gt; Of the scholastics he says:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=501}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Yet they will have us beleeve, that by the Almighty power of God, one body may be at one and the same time in many places [the problem of the universals]; and many bodies at one and the same time in one place [the whole and the parts]; ... And these are but a small part of the Incongruencies they are forced to, from their disputing philosophically, instead of admiring, and adoring of the Divine and Incomprehensible Nature ...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The real distinction between essence and existence, and that between form and matter, which served for so long as the basis of metaphysics, Hobbes identifies as "the Error of Separated Essences."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=500}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The words "Is, or Bee, or Are, and the like" add no meaning to an argument nor do derived words such as "Entity, Essence, Essentially, Essentiality", which "are the names of nothing"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|pp=498–499}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but are mere "Signes" connecting "one name or attribute to another: as when we say, ''"a man is a living body"'', we mean not that the ''man'' is one thing, the ''living body'' another, and the ''is'', or ''being'' a third: but that the ''man'', and the ''living body'', is the same thing; ..."  Metaphysiques, Hobbes says, is "far from the possibility of being understood" and is "repugnant to natural reason."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|pp=496–497}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Being to Hobbes (and the other empiricists) is the physical universe:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=497}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The world, (I mean ... the Universe, that is, the whole masse of all things that are) is corporeall, that is to say, Body; and hath the dimension of magnitude, namely, Length, Bredth and Depth: also every part of Body, is likewise Body ... and consequently every part of the Universe is Body, and that which is not Body, is no part of the Universe: and because the Universe is all, that which is no part of it is nothing; and consequently no where."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hobbes' view is representative of his tradition. As Aristotle offered the categories and the act of existence, and Aquinas the analogy of being, the rationalists also had their own system, the [[great chain of being]], an interlocking hierarchy of beings from God to dust.

===Idealist systems===
In addition to the [[materialism]] of the empiricists, under the same [[aegis]] of Reason, rationalism produced systems that were diametrically opposed now called [[idealism]], which denied the reality of [[matter]] in favor of the reality of [[mind]]. By a 20th-century classification, the idealists ([[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Hegel]] and others), are considered the beginning of [[continental philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fritzman|first=J.

==Being in continental philosophy and existentialism==
Some philosophers deny that the concept of "being" has any meaning at all, since we only define an object's existence by its relation to other objects, and actions it undertakes. The term "I am" has no meaning by itself; it must have an action or relation appended to it. This in turn has led to the thought that "being" and [[nothing]]ness are closely related, developed in [[Existentialism|existential]] philosophy.

[[Existentialism|Existentialist]] philosophers such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]], as well as [[continental philosophy|continental philosophers]] such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] have also written extensively on the concept of being. Hegel distinguishes between the being of objects ([[being in itself]]) and the being of people (''[[Geist (philosophy)|Geist]])''.  Hegel, however, did not think there was much hope for delineating a "meaning" of being, because being stripped of all predicates is simply nothing.

Heidegger, in his quest to re-pose the original pre-Socratic question of Being, wondered at how to meaningfully ask the question of the meaning of being, since it is both the greatest, as it includes everything that is, and the least, since no particular thing can be said of it.  He distinguishes between different modes of beings: a privative mode is [[present-at-hand]], whereas beings in a fuller sense are described as [[ready-to-hand]].  The one who asks the question of Being is described as Da-sein ("there/here-being") or '''[[being-in-the-world]].''' Sartre, popularly understood as misreading Heidegger (an understanding supported by Heidegger's essay "Letter on Humanism" which responds to Sartre's famous address, "Existentialism is a Humanism"), employs modes of being in an attempt to ground his concept of freedom ontologically by distinguishing between being-in-itself and being-for-itself.

Being is also understood as one's "state of being," and hence its common meaning is in the context of human (personal) [[experience]], with aspects that involve expressions and manifestations coming from an innate "being", or personal character. [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] coined the term "''[[dasein]]''" for this property of being in his influential work ''[[Being and Time]]'' ("this entity which each of us is himself…we shall denote by the term 'dasein.'"&lt;ref name="dasein1"/&gt;), in which he argued that being or ''dasein'' links one's sense of one's body to one's perception of [[world]]. Heidegger, amongst others, referred to an innate language as the foundation of being, which gives [[Information|signal]] to all aspects of being.

Soc.|year=1951|volume=A64|pages=874|doi=10.1088/0370-1298/64/10/303|bibcode = 1951PPSA...64..874B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Birks|first=J.B.|title=The Theory and Practice of Scintillation Counting|year=1964|publisher=Pergamon|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; (named after British physicist John B. Birks)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsc-international.org/conf/pfiles/lsc1979_vol_1_011.pdf A Tribute to Professor John B Birks - LSC International Home]&lt;/ref&gt; is an empirical formula for the light yield per path length as a function of the energy loss per path length for a particle traversing a [[scintillator]], and gives a relation that is not linear at high loss rates.

==Overview==
The relation is:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dL}{dx}  = S \frac{\frac{dE}{dx}}{1+k_B\frac{dE}{dx}}.&lt;/math&gt;
where ''L'' is the light yield, ''S'' is the scintillation efficiency, ''dE/dx'' is the energy loss of the particle per path length, and ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' is Birks' constant, which depends on the material. ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' is 0.126&amp;nbsp;mm/MeV for [[polystyrene]]-based scintillators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Leverington|first=B.L.|title=A 1 mm Scintillating Fibre Tracker Readout by a Multi-anode Photomultiplier |year=1970 |eprint=1106.5649v2 |author2=Anelli| author3=Campana |author4=Rosellini| class=physics.ins-det}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1.26–2.07 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; g/(MeV cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for [[polyvinyltoluene]]-based scintillators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Torrisi|first1=L.|title=Plastic scintillator investigations for relative dosimetry in proton-therapy|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B|date=October 2000|volume=170|issue=3-4|pages=523–530|doi=10.1016/S0168-583X(00)00237-8|bibcode=2000NIMPB.170..523T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birks speculated that the loss of linearity is due to recombination and quenching effects between the excited molecules and the surrounding substrate.  Birks' law has mostly been tested for [[Scintillation (physics)#Scintillation of organic scintillators|organic scintillators]].  Its applicability to inorganic scintillators is debated.  A good discussion can be found in ''Particle Detectors at Accelerators: Organic scintillators''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Kurtis|title=Particle Detectors at Accelerators: Organic scintillators|url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2011/reviews/rpp2011-rev-particle-detectors-accel.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A compilation of Birks' constant for various materials can be found in ''Semi-empirical calculation of quenching factors for ions in scintillators''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Tretyak| first=V.I.| title=Semi-empirical calculation of quenching factors for ions in scintillators| journal=Astroparticle Physics| year=2010| volume=33| pages=40–53| doi=10.1016/j.astropartphys.2009.11.002|arxiv = 0911.3041 |bibcode = 2010APh....33...40T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Nyibule| first=S.| title=Birks' scaling of the particle light output functions for the EJ 299-33 plastic scintillator| journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A| year=2014|doi=10.1016/j.nima.2014.09.056|bibcode = 2014NIMPA.768..141N| volume=768| pages=141–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A more complete theory of scintillation saturation, that gives Birks' law when only unimolecular de-excitation is included, can be found in a paper by Blanc, Cambou, and De Laford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blanc|first=D. |author2=Cambou, F. |author3=De Lafond, Y.G.|journal=C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8579">'''Breath gas analysis''' is a method for gaining non-invasive information on the clinical state of an individual by monitoring [[volatile organic compound]]s present in the exhaled [[breath]]. Breath gas concentration can then be related to [[blood]] concentrations via [[mathematical modeling]] as for example in [[blood alcohol]] testing.

==History==

The area of modern breath testing commenced in 1971, when [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Linus Pauling]] demonstrated that human breath is a complex gas, containing more than 200 different volatile organic compounds. However, physicians have used breath analysis since the days of [[Hippocrates]].&lt;ref&gt;Anil S. Modak:  ''Single time point diagnostic breath tests: a review'', J. Breath Res. 4 (2010), 017002 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1752-7155/4/1/017002]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

[[Endogenous]] volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released within the human organism as a result of normal [[metabolism|metabolic]] activity or due to pathological disorders. They enter the blood stream and are eventually metabolized or excreted via [[exhalation]], [[skin]] emission, [[urine]], etc.

Breath sampling is non-invasive and breath samples can be extracted as often as desired.&lt;ref&gt;H. Koc, K. Unterkofler, S. Teschl, and J. King: "Mathematical modeling for breath gas analysis," 3. Forschungsforum der Österreichischen Fachhochschulen, Wien 2011. [http://www.esi.ac.at/~susanne/FFOeFH2011_KUTK.pdf]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identification and quantification of potential disease [[biomarker]]s can be seen as the driving force for the analysis of exhaled breath. Moreover, future applications for medical diagnosis and therapy control with dynamic assessments of normal physiological function or pharmacodynamics  are intended.

[[Exogenous]] VOCs penetrating the body as a result of  environmental exposure can be used to quantify body burden. Also breath tests are often based on the ingestion of  isotopically labeled precursors, producing isotopically labeled [[carbon dioxide]] and potentially many other metabolites.

However, breath sampling is far from being a standardized procedure due to the numerous confounding factors biasing the concentrations of volatiles in breath. These factors are related to both the breath sampling protocols as well as the complex physiological mechanisms underlying [[pulmonary gas exchange]]. Even under resting conditions exhaled breath concentrations of VOCs can strongly be influenced by specific physiological parameters such as cardiac output and breathing patterns, depending on the physico-chemical properties of the compound under study.

Understanding the influence of all this factors and their control is necessary for achieving an accurate standardization of breath sample collection and for the correct deduction of the corresponding blood concentration levels.

The simplest model relating breath gas concentration to blood concentrations was developed by Farhi&lt;ref&gt;Leon E. Farhi: ''Elimination of inert gas by the lung,'' Respiration Physiology 3 (1967) 1–11 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0034-5687(67)90018-7]&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
C_A = \frac{C_{\bar v}}{\lambda_\text{b:air} + \dot V_A/\dot Q_c},
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; C_A &lt;/math&gt; denotes the alveolar concentration which is assumed to be equal to the measured concentration.
It expresses the fact that the concentration of an inert gas in the alveolar air depends on the mixed venous concentration  &lt;math&gt;C_{\bar v} &lt;/math&gt;, the substance-specific blood:air [[partition coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\text{b:air} &lt;/math&gt;, and the [[ventilation-perfusion ratio]]  &lt;math&gt;\dot V_A/\dot Q_c &lt;/math&gt;.
But this model fails when two prototypical substances like [[acetone]] (partition coefficient  &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\text{b:air} = 340 &lt;/math&gt;) or [[isoprene]] (partition coefficient  &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\text{b:air} = 0.75  &lt;/math&gt; ) are measured.&lt;ref&gt;Julian King, Alexander Kupferthaler, [[Karl Unterkofler]], Helin Koc, Susanne Teschl, [[Gerald Teschl]], Wolfram Miekisch, Jochen Schubert, Hartmann Hinterhuber, and [[Anton Amann]]: ''Isoprene and acetone concentration profiles during exercise at an ergometer'', J. Breath Research 3, (2009) 027006 (16 pp) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1752-7163/3/2/027006]&lt;/ref&gt;

E.g., multiplying the proposed population mean of approximately &lt;math&gt; 1 \mu g/l &lt;/math&gt; acetone  in end-tidal breath by the partition coefficient &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\text{b:air} = 340 &lt;/math&gt; at body temperature  grossly underestimates observed (arterial) blood levels spreading around  &lt;math&gt; 1 mg/l &lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, breath profiles of acetone (and other highly soluble volatile compounds such as 2-pentanone or methyl acetate) associated with moderate workload ergometer challenges of normal healthy volunteers drastically depart from the trend suggested by the equation above.

Hence some more refined models are necessary. Such models have been developed recently.&lt;ref&gt;Julian King, Helin Koc,  Karl Unterkofler, Pawel Mochalski, Alexander Kupferthaler, Gerald Teschl, Susanne Teschl, Hartmann Hinterhuber, and Anton Amann: ''Physiological modeling of isoprene dynamics in exhaled breath,''  J. Theoret. Biol.  267  (2010), 626–637, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2145]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian King, Karl Unterkofler, Gerald Teschl, Susanne Teschl, Helin Koc, Hartmann Hinterhuber, and Anton Amann: ''A mathematical model for breath gas analysis of volatile organic compounds with special emphasis on acetone,'' J. Math. Biol. 63 (2011),  959-999, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00285-010-0398-9]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Breath gas analysis is used in a number of [[breath test]]s.

* [[Asthma]] detection by [[exhaled nitric oxide]]
* [[Blood alcohol]] testing&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. Hlastala: [http://www.mphlastala.com/abtreview.pdf ''The alcohol breath test—a review''], Journal of Applied Physiology (1998) vol. 84 no. 2, 401–408.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lung cancer]] detection&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/tech/mg19926715.200-nasas-electronic-nose-could-sniff-out-cancer.html NASA's electronic nose could sniff out cancer]", [[New Scientist]], 27 Aug. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breath collectors==

Breath can be collected using a variety of home-made and commercially available devices.  The three basic types of breath collector for VOC analysis are:

* Coated stainless steel canister
* End tidal air collector
* Tedlar bag

Each of these can be used as a vehicle for direct introduction of a gas sample into an appropriate analytical instrument, or serve as a reservoir of breath gas into which an absorption device such as an SPME fiber is placed to collect specific compounds.

==Analytical instruments==

Breath analysis can be done with various forms of mass spectrometry, but there are also simpler methods for specific purposes, such as the [[Halimeter]] and the [[breathalyzer]].

* Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry [[GC-MS]]
* Gas chromatography-UV spectrometry [[GC-UV]]
* Proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry [[PTR-MS]] and [[Time-of-flight mass spectrometry|PTR-TOF]]
* Selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry [[SIFT-MS]]
* Ion mobility spectrometry [[Ion mobility spectrometry|IMS]]
* Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy [[FTIR]]
* Laser spectrometry [[Spectroscopy]]
* [[Chemical sensors]] resp. [[Electronic nose]]

'''Carl Adam Petri''' (12 July 1926 – 2 July 2010) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]]. He was born in [[Leipzig]].&lt;ref name="smith15"&gt;{{cite book| first=Einar | last=Smith | title=Carl Adam Petri: Life and Science | publisher=Springer | isbn=978-3-662-48092-2 | date=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Petri created his major scientific contribution, the concept of the [[Petri net]], in 1939 at the age of 13, for the purpose of describing chemical processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Petri_net] Carl Adam Petri and Wolfgang Reisig (2008), Scholarpedia, 3(4):6477, retrieved 2016-02-24.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941 his father told him about [[Konrad Zuse]]'s work on computing machines and Carl Adam started building his own [[analog computer]].

After earning his [[Abitur]] at the [[Thomasschule zu Leipzig|Thomasschule]] he was in 1944 drafted into the [[Wehrmacht]] and eventually went into British captivity.

Petri started studying mathematics at the [[Technischen Hochschule Hannover]] (today, the [[University of Hanover]]) in 1950. He documented the Petri net in 1962 as part of his dissertation, ''Kommunikation mit Automaten'' (communication with automata). He worked from 1959 until 1962 at the [[University of Bonn]] and received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in 1962 from the [[Darmstadt University of Technology]]. From 1963 to 1968 he directed the computing centre of Bonn University. In 1968 he became head of ''Forschungsinstitut für Informationssysteme'' of the newly founded [[Gesellschaft für Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung]] (GMD). He retired in 1991.

In 1988 Petri became honorary professor of the [[University of Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/TGI/mitarbeiter/profs/petri_eng.html Petri's page at the University of Hamburg]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Academia Europaea]].

Petri's work significantly advanced the fields of [[parallel computing]] and [[distributed computing]], and it helped define the modern studies of [[complex system]]s and [[workflow management system]]s. His contributions have been in the broader area of [[network theory]] which includes coordination models and theories of interaction, and eventually led to the formal study of software connectors.

==Awards==
Petri was honored with the following awards:

*1993: [[Konrad Zuse Medal]] of the [[Gesellschaft für Informatik]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gi.de/?id=276 Konrad-Zuse-Medaille] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084001/http://www.gi.de/?id=276 |date=2014-08-19 }}, [[Gesellschaft für Informatik]] (in German), retrieved 2012-03-09.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*1996: [[Werner von Siemens Ring]], a prestigious German award in technical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[https://idw-online.de/de/news1391] idw - Informationsdienst Wissenschaft (in German), retrieved 2016-02-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://siemens-ring.de/portfolio_page/carl-adam-petri/] Stiftung Werner-von-Siemens-Ring (in German), retrieved 2016-02-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Copwatch''' (also '''Cop Watch''') is a network of [[activist]] organizations, typically autonomous and focused in local areas, in the United States and Canada (and to a lesser extent Europe) that observe and document police activity while looking for signs of [[police misconduct]] and [[police brutality]]. They believe that monitoring police activity on the streets is a way to prevent police brutality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Visual Culture Reader, 2nd edition |chapter= |editor= |author=Nicholas Mirzoeff |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=0-415-25222-9 |page=390 |pages= |url= |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stated goal of at least one Copwatch group is to engage in monitoring and videotaping police activity in the interest of holding the police accountable in the events involving assaults or police misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Surveillance and Security: Technological Politics and Power in Everyday Life|author=Torin Monahan|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-95393-1|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copwatch was first started in [[Berkeley, California]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="Chermak07"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Shelley L. |last1=Schlief |chapter=The Rodney King Beating Trial: A Landmark for Reform |pages=139–60 [[{{Google books|UNex7XqLuiIC|page=157|plainurl=yes}} 157]] |chapterurl={{Google books|UNex7XqLuiIC|page=139|plainurl=yes}} |year=2007 |editor1-first=Steven M. |editor1-last=Chermak |editor2-first=Frankie Y. |editor2-last=Bailey |title=Crimes and Trials of the Century: From the Black Sox scandal to the Attica prison riots |volume=2 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-313-34110-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copwatch methods==
The main function of most Copwatch groups is monitoring police activity. "Copwatchers" go out on foot or driving patrols in their communities and record interactions between the police and civilians. Copwatchers hope that monitoring police activity will provide a deterrent against police misconduct. Some groups also patrol at [[protest]]s and [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] to ensure that police do not violate the rights of protesters. One Copwatch organization states that it has a policy of non-interference with the police, although this may not be true for all groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phoenixcopwatch.org/about.html |title=About Phoenix Copwatch |publisher=Phoenix Copwatch |accessdate=2008-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907125425/http://www.phoenixcopwatch.org/about.html |archivedate=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Phoenix, Arizona]], copwatchers have increased efforts of "reverse surveillance" on the police in an effort to document [[racial profiling]].&lt;ref name="CNNPhoenix"/&gt; They believe that [[Arizona Senate Bill 1070]], a controversial law that allows police to question people they believe are illegal immigrants, will increase racial profiling by police.&lt;ref name="CNNPhoenix"&gt;{{cite news |author = Emanuella Grinberg|url= http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/05/11/phoenix.copwatch.arpaio/index.html?hpt=C1|title=Cop-watchers look for racial profiling on the streets of Phoenix | publisher= CNN|date= May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copwatch groups also hold "Know Your Rights" forums to educate the public about their legal and [[human rights]] when interacting with the police, and some groups organize events to highlight problems of [[police abuse]] in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Michelle Chen|url=http://newstandardnews.net/content/index.cfm/items/1507|title='Copwatch' Activists Patrol Communities to Thwart Police Misconduct|publisher=The New Standard|year=2005|accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response to the killing of Kendra James==
In 2003, [[Kendra James]] was fatally shot by [[Portland, Oregon]] Officer Scott McCollister as she attempted to drive away from a traffic stop with Officer McCollister attempting to pull her out of the vehicle. After the shooting Copwatch offered a reward for a photograph of McCollister. It then produced and distributed posters bearing McCollister's photo and the phrase "Getting away with murder".

The editorial staff of [[Willamette Week]] opined that the poster was "inflamed rhetoric" which would harm "the relationship between the Portland police and the community it serves", and claimed that protest posters put up by the Rose City chapter of Copwatch were aimed at "inciting generalized anti-cop hysteria at the expense of informed criticism".&lt;ref name="WW"&gt;{{cite web|last1=WW Editorial Staff|title=Portland's crazed leftists / Arissa / Rose City Copwatch|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-3106-portlands-crazed-leftists-arissa-rose-city-copwatch.html|website=Willamette Week|publisher=Willamette Week|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==William Cardenas video==
[[File:Cardenas-YouTube.jpg|right|200px|thumb| November 3, 2006: Video showing an LAPD officer striking William Cardenas 6 times in the face as he struggles to prevent the officers from handcuffing him.]] 
On November 3, 2006, CopWatch [[Los Angeles, California|LA]] posted a video showing the arrest of William Cardenas, whom police described as "a known gang member who had been wanted on a felony warrant for receiving stolen property". According to the arrest report, when officers tried to arrest Cardenas as he was drinking beer on the sidewalk with two others, he fled, but was caught and tripped by the officers, who then began to attempt to handcuff Cardenas as he fought with the officers to avoid being arrested.

The video, in which Cardenas struggles to prevent the police from handcuffing him, shows an officer repeatedly punching him in the face while trying to force his hands together. The officers indicated that they were unable to subdue Cardenas with pepper spray, which seemed to have "little effect", and that some of the punches were delivered in response to Cardenas putting his hand on one officer's gun holster during the struggle. According to the arrest report, several witnesses confirmed that Cardenas threw punches at the officers, who were only able to handcuff him after two of his friends arrived and told him to stop fighting.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite news|title=Alleged LAPD Brutality Video Sparks Probe|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/11/09/national/main2170342.shtml|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=2006-11-10 | date=2006-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Video, arrest report at odds|author=Richard Winton |author2=Patrick McGreevy |author3=Andrew Blankstein|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1160385141.html?dids=1160385141:1160385141&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+11%2C+2006&amp;author=Richard+Winton%2C+Patrick+McGreevy+and+Andrew+Blankstein&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.1&amp;desc=THE+STATE%3B+Video%2C+arrest+report+at+odds%3B+An+LAPD+officer+says+he+punched+William+Cardenas+twice.+A+tape+that+aired+on+YouTube+shows+at+least+six+blows. |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2006-11-11 | date=2006-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circulation of this video led to nationwide media coverage of Copwatch, and, although the LAPD had begun a use-of-force investigation the same day as the arrest, prompted an additional investigation into police conduct by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=YouTube.com Video Prompts Probe of LAPD|last=Veiga|first=Alex|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-11-13-youtube-arrest_x.htm|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2006-11-13 | date=2006-11-13|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Superior Court]] commissioner had previously concluded that the use of force was reasonable because Cardenas was resisting arrest.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt;

==Awards==
In 2013 Berkeley Copwatch was awarded the [[James Madison Freedom of Information Award]] by the [[Society of Professional Journalists]], Northern California chapter, for "effective use of public records to block a Homeland Security grant for putting an armored military vehicle on the streets of Albany and Berkeley."&lt;ref name="BDP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Berkeleyans Receive Awards from Society of Professional Journalists|url=http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2013-02-08/article/40755?headline=Berkeleyans-Receive-Awards-from-Society-of-Professional-Journalists--|website=www.berkeleydailyplanet.com|publisher=Michael O'Malley|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Joe Arpaio]], the [[Maricopa County Sheriff's Office controversies#Joe Arpaio|controversial]] Sheriff of [[Maricopa County]], [[Arizona]], has said that his opponents' videotaping of police during traffic stops "create safety concerns for his deputies."&lt;ref name="ABC15.com"&gt;{{cite news|author=ABC15.com|title=Nearly 70 arrested during Arpaio's West Valley crime sweeps | url=http://www.abc15.com/content/news/westvalley/surprise/story/Nearly-70-arrested-during-Arpaio-s-West-Valley/IVjY5KNxnEWn-CkwFVE15Q.cspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021083210/http://www.abc15.com/content/news/westvalley/surprise/story/Nearly-70-arrested-during-Arpaio-s-West-Valley/IVjY5KNxnEWn-CkwFVE15Q.cspx|archivedate=October 21, 2009|date=October 20, 2009|accessdate=October 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Dees, former police officer and editor-in-chief of Officer.com, alleges that Copwatch selectively distributes video and photographic media to "spin" incidents against law enforcement.&lt;ref name=officer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officer.com/interactive/2006/11/17/copwatch/ |title=Cop Watch|author=Tim Dees|publisher=officer.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614191025/http://www.officer.com/interactive/2006/11/17/copwatch/ |archivedate = 2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Culture''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʌ|l|tʃ|ər}}) is the [[social behavior]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[Society|societies]]. Culture is considered a central concept in [[anthropology]], encompassing the range of phenomena that are transmitted through social [[learning]] in human [[society|societies]]. [[Cultural universals]] are found in all human societies; these include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[Tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers the physical expressions of culture, such as technology, architecture and art, whereas the immaterial aspects of culture such as principles of [[social organization]] (including practices of [[political organization]] and social [[institutions]]), [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]] (both [[writing|written]] and [[oral literature|oral]]), and [[science]] comprise the [[intangible cultural heritage]] of a society.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber and 2010 53"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995|title=Sociology|last=Macionis|first=John J|last2=Gerber|first2=Linda Marie|date=2011|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|oclc=652430995|isbn=978-0137001613|location=Toronto|language=English|page=53|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995|archive-date=August 18, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[humanities]], one sense of culture as an attribute of the individual has been the degree to which they have cultivated a particular level of sophistication in [[the arts]], sciences, [[education]], or manners. The level of cultural sophistication has also sometimes been seen to distinguish [[civilization]]s from less complex societies. Such hierarchical perspectives on culture are also found in [[Social class|class-based]] distinctions between a [[high culture]] of the social [[elite]] and a [[low culture]], [[popular culture]], or [[folk culture]] of the lower classes, distinguished by the stratified access to [[cultural capital]]. In common parlance, culture is often used to refer specifically to the symbolic markers used by [[ethnicity|ethnic groups]] to distinguish themselves visibly from each other such as [[body modification]], [[clothing]] or [[jewelry]]. [[Media culture|Mass culture]] refers to the [[Mass production|mass-produced]] and [[mass media]]ted forms of [[consumer culture]] that emerged in the 20th century. Some schools of philosophy, such as [[Marxism]] and [[critical theory]], have argued that culture is often used politically as a tool of the elites to manipulate the lower classes and create a [[false consciousness]], and such perspectives are common in the discipline of [[cultural studies]]. In the wider [[social sciences]], the theoretical perspective of [[cultural materialism (cultural studies)|cultural materialism]] holds that human symbolic culture arises from the material conditions of human life, as humans create the conditions for physical survival, and that the basis of culture is found in [[human evolution|evolved biological]] dispositions.

When used as a [[count noun]], a "culture" is the set of customs, [[tradition]]s, and values of a society or community, such as an ethnic group or nation. Culture is the set of knowledge acquired over time. In this sense, [[multiculturalism]] values the peaceful coexistence and mutual respect between different cultures inhabiting the same planet. Sometimes "culture" is also used to describe specific practices within a subgroup of a society, a [[subculture]] (e.g. "[[bro culture]]"), or a [[counterculture]]. Within [[cultural anthropology]], the ideology and analytical stance of [[cultural relativism]] holds that cultures cannot easily be objectively ranked or evaluated because any evaluation is necessarily situated within the value system of a given culture.

== Etymology ==
The modern term "culture" is based on a term used by the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] orator [[Cicero]] in his ''[[Tusculanae Disputationes]]'', where he wrote of a cultivation of the soul or ''"cultura animi,"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ZcOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA273|title=Tusculanes|last=Cicéron|first=Marcus Tullius Cicero|last2=Bouhier|first2=Jean|date=1812|publisher=J. Gaude|location=Nismes|oclc=457735057|page=273|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; using an [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[metaphor]] for the development of a philosophical soul, understood [[teleology|teleologically]] as the highest possible ideal for human development. [[Samuel Pufendorf]] took over this metaphor in a modern context, meaning something similar, but no longer assuming that philosophy was man's natural perfection. His use, and that of many writers after him, "''refers to all the ways in which human beings overcome their original [[Barbarian|barbarism]], and through artifice, become fully human."''&lt;ref name=velkley&gt;{{Cite book|title=Being after Rousseau: philosophy and culture in question|last=Velkley|first=Richard L|date=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|oclc=47930775|isbn=978-0226852560|chapter=The Tension in the Beautiful: On Culture and Civilization in Rousseau and German Philosophy|pages=11–30|location=Chicago|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, philosopher [[Edward S. Casey]] wrote, "The very word ''culture'' meant 'place tilled' in Middle English, and the same word goes back to Latin ''colere'', 'to inhabit, care for, till, worship' and ''cultus'', 'A cult, especially a religious one.' To be cultural, to have a culture, is to inhabit a place sufficiently intensive to cultivate it—to be responsible for it, to respond to it, to attend to it caringly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sorrells|first1=Kathryn|title=Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice|date=2015|publisher=Sage|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1412927444}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;!-- Ref provided is based purely on ASIN from earlier, incomplete, citation. NEEDS Verification --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture described by [[Richard Velkley]]:&lt;ref name=velkley/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;... originally meant the cultivation of the soul or mind, acquires most of its later modern meaning in the writings of the 18th-century German thinkers, who were on various levels developing [[Rousseau]]'s criticism of "[[modernity|modern]] [[liberalism]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]". Thus a contrast between "culture" and "[[civilization]]" is usually implied in these authors, even when not expressed as such.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the words of anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.B. Tylor]], it is "that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."{{sfn|Tylor|1974|loc=1}} Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, "Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/9294719|title=Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability|last=James|first=Paul|last2=Magee|first2=Liam|last3=Scerri|first3=Andy|last4=Steger|first4=Manfred|date=2015|isbn=978-1138025721|oclc=942553107|page=53|publisher=Routledge|location=London|language=en|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626015736/http://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_|archive-date=June 26, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is used in a general sense as the evolved ability to categorize and represent experiences with [[symbol]]s and to act imaginatively and creatively. This ability arose with the evolution of [[behavioral modernity]] in humans around 50,000 years ago, and is often thought to be unique to humans, although some other species have demonstrated similar, though much less complex, abilities for social learning. It is also used to denote the complex networks of practices and accumulated knowledge and ideas that is transmitted through social [[interaction]] and exist in specific human groups, or cultures, using the plural form.

[[Raimon Panikkar]] identified 29 ways in which [[cultural change]] can be brought about, including growth, development, evolution, [[Involution (esoterism)|involution]], renovation, [[reconception]], reform, innovation, [[revivalism]], revolution, [[mutation]], progress, [[diffusion]], osmosis, borrowing, [[eclecticism]], [[syncretism]], modernization, [[indigenization]], and transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religious Pluralism: An Indian Christian Perspective|last=Panikkar|first=Raimon|editor-last=Pathil|editor-first=Kuncheria|date=1991|publisher=[[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge|ISPCK]]|isbn=978-8172140052|oclc=25410539|pages=252–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, modernization could be viewed as adoption of Enlightenment era beliefs and practices, such as science, rationalism, industry, commerce, democracy, and the notion of progress.

[[Cultural invention]] has come to mean any innovation that is new and found to be useful to a group of people and expressed in their behavior but which does not exist as a physical object. Humanity is in a global "accelerating culture change period," driven by the expansion of international commerce, the mass media, and above all, the [[World population|human population]] explosion, among other factors.

Cultures are internally affected by both forces encouraging change and forces resisting change. These forces are related to both [[social structure]]s and natural events, and are involved in the perpetuation of cultural ideas and practices within current structures, which themselves are subject to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/change/change_2.htm|title=Culture Change: Processes of Change|last=O'Neil|first=Dennis|date=2006|website=Culture Change|publisher=Palomar College|access-date=October 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027181934/http://anthro.palomar.edu/change/change_2.htm|archive-date=October 27, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[structuration]].)

Social conflict and the development of technologies can produce changes within a society by altering social dynamics and promoting new [[schema (psychology)|cultural models]], and spurring or enabling [[generative actor|generative action]]. These social shifts may accompany [[ideology|ideological]] shifts and other types of cultural change. For example, the U.S. [[feminist movement]] involved new practices that produced a shift in gender relations, altering both gender and economic structures. Environmental conditions may also enter as factors. For example, after tropical forests returned at the end of the last [[ice age]], plants suitable for domestication were available, leading to the invention of [[agriculture]], which in turn brought about many cultural innovations and shifts in social dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pringle|first=Heather|date=November 20, 1998|title=The Slow Birth of Agriculture|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/282/5393/1446|journal=Science|language=en|volume=282|issue=5393|page=1446|doi=10.1126/science.282.5393.1446|issn=0036-8075|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807163436/http://science.sciencemag.org/content/282/5393/1446|archive-date=August 7, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies, which may also produce—or inhibit—social shifts and changes in cultural practices. War or competition over resources may impact technological development or social dynamics. Additionally, cultural ideas may transfer from one society to another, through diffusion or acculturation. In [[diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion]], the form of something (though not necessarily its meaning) moves from one culture to another. For example, [[hamburger]]s, fast food in the United States, seemed exotic when introduced into China.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} "Stimulus diffusion" (the sharing of ideas) refers to an element of one culture leading to an invention or propagation in another. "Direct borrowing," on the other hand, tends to refer to technological or tangible diffusion from one culture to another. [[Diffusion of innovations]] theory presents a research-based model of why and when individuals and cultures adopt new ideas, practices, and products.

[[Acculturation]] has different meanings, but in this context it refers to replacement of the traits of one culture with those of another, such as what happened to certain [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes and to many indigenous peoples across the globe during the process of [[colonization]]. Related processes on an individual level include [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] (adoption of a different culture by an individual) and [[transculturation]]. The transnational flow of culture has played a major role in merging different culture and sharing thoughts, ideas, and beliefs.

==Early modern discourses==

===German Romanticism===
[[File:Johann gottfried herder.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johann Herder]] called attention to national cultures.]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) formulated an individualist definition of "enlightenment" similar to the concept of ''[[bildung]]'': "Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1784. "Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?" (German: "Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufklärung?") ''Berlinische Monatsschrift'', December (Berlin Monthly)&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that this immaturity comes not from a lack of understanding, but from a lack of courage to think independently. Against this intellectual cowardice, Kant urged: ''Sapere aude'', "Dare to be wise!" In reaction to Kant, German scholars such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744–1803) argued that human creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms, is as important as human rationality. Moreover, Herder proposed a collective form of ''bildung'': "For Herder, Bildung was the totality of experiences that provide a coherent identity, and sense of common destiny, to a people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/SAAP/USC/pbt1.html|title=The German Bildung Tradition|last=Eldridge|first=Michael|publisher=[[UNC Charlotte]]|access-date=2017-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123162257/http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/SAAP/USC/pbt1.html|archive-date=January 23, 2009|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adolf Bastian.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Adolf Bastian]] developed a universal model of culture.]]
In 1795, the Prussian linguist and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] (1767–1835) called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant's and Herder's interests. During the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]], scholars in [[Germany]], especially those concerned with [[nationalism|nationalist]] movements—such as the nationalist struggle to create a "Germany" out of diverse principalities, and the nationalist struggles by ethnic minorities against the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]—developed a more inclusive notion of culture as "[[world view|worldview]]" (''Weltanschauung'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Humboldt, Worldview, and Language|last=Underhill|first=James W.|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Edinburgh|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this school of thought, each ethnic group has a distinct worldview that is incommensurable with the worldviews of other groups. Although more inclusive than earlier views, this approach to culture still allowed for distinctions between "civilized" and "primitive" or "tribal" cultures.

In 1860, [[Adolf Bastian]] (1826–1905) argued for "the psychic unity of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adolf Bastian and the psychic unity of mankind|last=Köpping|first=Klaus-Peter|date=2005|publisher=Lit Verlag|isbn=978-3825839895|oclc=977343058}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that a scientific comparison of all human societies would reveal that distinct worldviews consisted of the same basic elements. According to Bastian, all human societies share a set of "elementary ideas" (''Elementargedanken''); different cultures, or different "folk ideas" (''Völkergedanken''), are local modifications of the elementary ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://todayinsci.com/B/Bastian_Adolf/BastianAdolf.htm|title=Biography of Adolf Bastian, ethnologist|last=Ellis|first=Ian|website=Today in Science History|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806215336/https://todayinsci.com/B/Bastian_Adolf/BastianAdolf.htm|archive-date=August 6, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture.

===English Romanticism===
[[File:Matthew Arnold - Project Gutenberg eText 16745.jpg|thumb|left|upright|British poet and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] viewed "culture" as the cultivation of the humanist ideal.]]

In the 19th century, [[Humanism|humanists]] such as [[English people|English]] poet and essayist [[Matthew Arnold]] (1822–1888) used the word "culture" to refer to an ideal of individual human refinement, of "the best that has been thought and said in the world."&lt;ref name=anarchy&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/nonfiction_u/arnoldm_ca/ca_all.html|title=Culture and Anarchy|last=Arnold|first=Matthew|date=1869|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106012655/http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/nonfiction_u/arnoldm_ca/ca_all.html|archive-date=January 6, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of culture is also comparable to the [[German people|German]] concept of ''bildung'': "...culture being a pursuit of our total [[perfection]] by means of getting to know, on all the matters which most concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world."&lt;ref name=anarchy /&gt;

In practice, ''culture'' referred to an [[elite]] ideal and was associated with such activities as [[art]], [[European classical music|classical music]], and [[haute cuisine]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1983), p. 90. Cited in {{Cite book|title=Understanding popular music|last=Roy|first=Shuker|date=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415107235|oclc=245910934|page=5}} argues that contemporary definitions of culture fall into three possibilities or mixture of the following three:
* "a general process of intellectual, spiritual, and aesthetic development"
* "a particular way of life, whether of a people, period, or a group"
* "the works and practices of intellectual and especially artistic activity".&lt;/ref&gt; As these forms were associated with urban life, "culture" was identified with "civilization" (from lat. ''civitas'', city). Another facet of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement was an interest in [[folklore]], which led to identifying a "culture" among non-elites. This distinction is often characterized as that between [[high culture]], namely that of the [[Ruling class|ruling]] [[social group]], and [[low culture]]. In other words, the idea of "culture" that developed in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries reflected inequalities within European societies.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 1981, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|upright|British anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Edward Tylor]] was one of the first English-speaking scholars to use the term culture in an inclusive and universal sense.]]

Matthew Arnold contrasted "culture" with [[anarchy]]; other Europeans, following [[philosophy|philosophers]] [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], contrasted "culture" with "the state of nature." According to Hobbes and Rousseau, the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] who were being conquered by Europeans from the 16th centuries on were living in a state of nature{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}; this opposition was expressed through the contrast between "civilized" and "uncivilized." According to this way of thinking, one could classify some countries and nations as more civilized than others and some people as more cultured than others. This contrast led to [[Herbert Spencer]]'s theory of [[Social Darwinism]] and [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]'s theory of [[cultural evolution]]. Just as some critics have argued that the distinction between high and low cultures is really an expression of the conflict between European elites and non-elites, other critics have argued that the distinction between civilized and uncivilized people is really an expression of the conflict between European colonial powers and their colonial subjects.

Other 19th-century critics, following Rousseau, have accepted this differentiation between higher and lower culture, but have seen the refinement and [[sophistication]] of high culture as corrupting and unnatural developments that obscure and distort people's essential nature.&lt;!-- i.e. American Transcendentalism?? --&gt; These critics considered [[folk music]] (as produced by "the folk," i.e., rural, illiterate, peasants) to honestly express a natural way of life, while classical music seemed superficial and decadent. Equally, this view often portrayed [[indigenous peoples]] as "[[noble savage]]s" living [[authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]] and unblemished lives, uncomplicated and uncorrupted by the highly stratified [[capitalism|capitalist]] systems of [[Western culture|the West]].

In 1870 the anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Edward Tylor]] (1832–1917) applied these ideas of higher versus lower culture to propose a theory of the [[evolution of religion]]. According to this theory, religion evolves from more polytheistic to more monotheistic forms.&lt;ref&gt;McClenon, pp. 528–29&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, he redefined culture as a diverse set of activities characteristic of all human societies. This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture.

==Sociology==
{{main|Sociology of culture}}
The [[sociology of culture]] concerns culture as manifested in [[society]]. For sociologist [[Georg Simmel]] (1858–1918), culture referred to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/oclc/951272809|title=Georg Simmel on individuality and social forms: selected writings|last=Simmel|first=Georg|editor-last=Levine|editor-first=Donald N|date=1971|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226757766|location=Chicago|page=xix|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912194431/https://www.worldcat.org/title/oclc/951272809|archive-date=September 12, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, culture in the [[sociology|sociological]] field can be defined as the ways of thinking, the ways of acting, and the material objects that together shape a people's way of life. Culture can be any of two types, [[non-material culture]] or [[material culture]].&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber and 2010 53" /&gt; Non-material culture refers to the non-physical ideas that individuals have about their culture, including values, belief systems, rules, norms, morals, language, organizations, and institutions, while material culture is the physical evidence of a culture in the objects and architecture they make or have made. The term tends to be relevant only in archeological and anthropological studies, but it specifically means all material evidence which can be attributed to culture, past or present.

Cultural sociology first emerged in [[Weimar Germany]] (1918–1933), where sociologists such as [[Alfred Weber]] used the term ''Kultursoziologie'' (cultural sociology). Cultural sociology was then "reinvented" in the English-speaking world as a product of the "[[cultural turn]]" of the 1960s, which ushered in [[structuralism (sociology)|structuralist]] and [[postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] approaches to social science. This type of cultural sociology may be loosely regarded as an approach incorporating [[cultural analysis]] and [[critical theory]]. Cultural sociologists tend to reject scientific methods, instead [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutically]] focusing on words, artifacts and symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html|title=A Physicist Experiments with Cultural Studies|last=Sokal|first=Alan D.|date=June 5, 1996|website=Lingua Franca|access-date=October 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326152500/http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html|archive-date=March 26, 2007|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}} Physicist [[Alan Sokal]] published a paper in a journal of cultural sociology stating that gravity was a social construct that should be examined hermeneutically. See [[Sokal affair]] for further details.&lt;/ref&gt; "Culture" has since become an important concept across many branches of sociology, including resolutely scientific fields like [[social stratification]] and [[social network|social network analysis]]. As a result, there has been a recent influx of quantitative sociologists to the field. Thus, there is now a growing group of sociologists of culture who are, confusingly, not cultural sociologists. These scholars reject the abstracted postmodern aspects of cultural sociology, and instead look for a theoretical backing in the more scientific vein of [[social psychology]] and [[cognitive science]]. {{Citation needed|reason=Is any research confirms this claim/trend?

===Early researchers and development of cultural sociology===
The sociology of culture grew from the intersection between sociology (as shaped by early theorists like [[Karl Marx|Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Karl Marx: His Life and Environment|last=Berlin|first=Isaiah|last2=Ryan|first2=Alan|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195103267|oclc=611127754|location=New York|language=English|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]) with the growing discipline of [[anthropology]], wherein researchers pioneered ethnographic strategies for describing and analyzing a variety of cultures around the world. Part of the legacy of the early development of the field lingers in the methods (much of cultural sociological research is qualitative), in the theories (a variety of critical approaches to sociology are central to current research communities), and in the substantive focus of the field. For instance, relationships between [[popular culture]], political control, and [[social class]] were early and lasting concerns in the field.

==Cultural studies==
In the [[United Kingdom]], sociologists and other scholars influenced by [[Marxism]] such as [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] (1932–2014) and [[Raymond Williams]] (1921–1988) developed [[cultural studies]]. Following nineteenth-century Romantics, they identified "culture" with consumption goods and leisure activities (such as art, music, film, [[food]], sports, and clothing). They saw patterns of consumption and leisure as determined by [[relations of production]], which led them to focus on class relations and the organization of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Raymond|date=1983|title=Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/keywords-a-vocabulary-of-culture-and-society/oclc/906396817|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=87–93, 236–38|language=English|journal=|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912193349/https://www.worldcat.org/title/keywords-a-vocabulary-of-culture-and-society/oclc/906396817|archive-date=September 12, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/ways-of-seeing/oclc/780459348|title=Ways of seeing|last=Berger|first=John|date=1972|publisher=Peter Smithn|isbn=978-0563122449|oclc=780459348|language=English|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912191748/https://www.worldcat.org/title/ways-of-seeing/oclc/780459348|archive-date=September 12, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, cultural studies focuses largely on the study of [[popular culture]]; that is, on the social meanings of mass-produced consumer and leisure goods. [[Richard Hoggart]] coined the term in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]] or CCCS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Studying Culture – Reflections and Assessment: An Interview with Richard Hoggart|journal=Media, Culture, and Society|volume=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since become strongly associated with [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/sep/23/communities.politicsphilosophyandsociety|title=Cultural hallmark|last=Adams|first=Tim|date=September 23, 2007|work=The Guardian|access-date=October 30, 2016|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031030223/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/sep/23/communities.politicsphilosophyandsociety|archive-date=October 31, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; who succeeded Hoggart as Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stuart Hall|last=James|first=Procter|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415262675|oclc=318376213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural studies in this sense, then, can be viewed as a limited concentration scoped on the intricacies of consumerism, which belongs to a wider culture sometimes referred to as "[[Western culture|Western civilization]]" or "[[globalism]]."

From the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall's pioneering work, along with that of his colleagues [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], [[Dick Hebdige]], Tony Jefferson, and [[Angela McRobbie]], created an international intellectual movement. As the field developed, it began to combine [[political economy]], [[communication]], [[sociology]], [[social theory]], [[literary theory]], [[Media influence|media theory]], [[film theory|film/video studies]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[philosophy]], [[museum studies]], and [[art history]] to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of [[ideology]], [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[social class]], and/or [[gender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Cultural Studies|last=Sardar|first=Ziauddin|last2=Van Loon|first2=Borin|last3=Appignanesi|first3=Richard|date=1994|publisher=Totem Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1840465877|oclc=937991291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural studies is concerned with the [[Value (personal and cultural)|meaning]] and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television, or eating out) in a given culture. It also studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television in order to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture, unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends in order to "fit in" certainly qualifies, since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice.

In the context of cultural studies, the idea of a ''text'' includes not only [[written language]], but also [[film]]s, [[photography|photographs]], [[fashion]] or [[hairstyle]]s: the texts of cultural studies comprise all the meaningful artifacts of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Myths of Oz: reading Australian popular culture|last=Fiske|first=John|last2=Turner|first2=Graeme|last3=Hodge|first3=Robert Ian Vere|date=1987|publisher=Allen and Unwin|isbn=978-0043303917|oclc=883364628|location=London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the discipline widens the concept of "culture." "Culture" for a cultural-studies researcher not only includes traditional [[high culture]] (the culture of [[Ruling class|ruling]] [[social group]]s)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://proxy2.hec.ca/login?url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/hecm/Doc?id=10439450|title=The dialogic imagination four essays|last=Bakhtin|first=Mikhail Mikhaĭlovich|last2=Holquist|first2=Michael|date=1981|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|language=English|oclc=872436352|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[popular culture]], but also everyday meanings and practices. The last two, in fact, have become the main focus of cultural studies. A further and recent approach is [[comparative cultural studies]], based on the disciplines of [[comparative literature]] and cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepress.purdue.edu/series/comparative-cultural-studies|title=Comparative Cultural Studies|date=2015|website=Purdue University Press|language=en|access-date=October 30, 2016|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805230001/http://www.thepress.purdue.edu/series/comparative-cultural-studies|archive-date=August 5, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] developed somewhat different versions of cultural studies after the late 1970s. The British version of cultural studies had originated in the 1950s and 1960s, mainly under the influence of Richard Hoggart, [[E.P. Thompson]], and [[Raymond Williams]], and later that of Stuart Hall and others at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the [[University of Birmingham]]. This included overtly political, [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] views, and criticisms of [[popular culture]] as "capitalist" [[mass culture]]; it absorbed some of the ideas of the [[Frankfurt School]] critique of the "[[culture industry]]" (i.e. mass culture). This emerges in the writings of early British cultural-studies scholars and their influences: see the work of (for example) Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, Paul Willis, and [[Paul Gilroy]].

In the United States, Lindlof and Taylor write, "Cultural studies [were] grounded in a pragmatic, liberal-pluralist tradition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Qualitative Communication Research Methods|last=Lindlof|first=Thomas R|last2=Taylor|first2=Bryan C|date=2002|publisher=Sage|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0761924937|oclc=780825710|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American version of cultural studies initially concerned itself more with understanding the subjective and appropriative side of audience reactions to, and uses of, [[mass culture]]; for example, American cultural-studies advocates wrote about the liberatory aspects of [[fandom]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The distinction between American and British strands, however, has faded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Some researchers, especially in early British cultural studies, apply a [[Marxist]] model to the field. This strain of thinking has some influence from the [[Frankfurt School]], but especially from the [[structuralism|structuralist]] Marxism of [[Louis Althusser]] and others. The main focus of an orthodox Marxist approach concentrates on the ''production'' of [[Value (personal and cultural)|meaning]]. This model assumes a mass production of culture and identifies [[power (social and political)|power]] as residing with those producing [[cultural artifact]]s. In a Marxist view, those who control the [[means of production]] (the economic ''base'') essentially control a culture.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Other approaches to cultural studies, such as [[feminist]] cultural studies and later American developments of the field, distance themselves from this view. They criticize the Marxist assumption of a single, dominant meaning, shared by all, for any cultural product. The non-Marxist approaches suggest that different ways of consuming cultural artifacts affect the meaning of the product. This view comes through in the book ''Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman'' (by Paul du Gay ''et al.''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gX-kksNNdFIC|title=Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman|editor1-last=du Gay|editor1-first=Paul|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-0761954026|oclc=949857570|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; which seeks to challenge the notion that those who produce commodities control the meanings that people attribute to them. Feminist cultural analyst, theorist, and art historian [[Griselda Pollock]] contributed to cultural studies from viewpoints of [[art history]] and [[psychoanalysis]]. The writer [[Julia Kristeva]] is among influential voices at the turn of the century, contributing to cultural studies from the field of art and psychoanalytical [[French feminism]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Petrakis and Kostis (2013) divide cultural background variables into two main groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrakis|first=Panagiotis|last2=Kostis|first2=Pantelis|date=2013-12-01|title=Economic growth and cultural change|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053535713000218|journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics|volume=47|pages=147–57|doi=10.1016/j.socec.2013.02.011|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117193727/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053535713000218|archive-date=January 17, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The first group covers the variables that represent the "efficiency orientation" of the societies: performance orientation, [[future orientation]], assertiveness, power distance and uncertainty avoidance.
# The second covers the variables that represent the "social orientation" of societies, i.e., the attitudes and lifestyles of their members. These variables include gender egalitarianism, institutional collectivism, in-group collectivism and human orientation.
In 2016, a new approach to culture was suggested by [[Rein Raud]],&lt;ref name="meaning-in-action"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meaning in Action: Outline of an Integral Theory of Culture|last=Rein|first=Raud|publisher=[[Polity (publisher)|Polity]]|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1509511242|oclc=944339574|date = 2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; who defines culture as the sum of resources available to human beings for making sense of their world and proposes a two-tiered approach, combining the study of texts (all reified meanings in circulation) and cultural practices (all repeatable actions that involve the production, dissemination or transmission of meanings), thus making it possible to re-link anthropological and sociological study of culture with the tradition of textual theory.

The '''Deutsch limit''' is an [[aphorism]] about the [[Information design|information density]] of [[visual programming language]]s originated by [[L Peter Deutsch|L. Peter Deutsch]] that states:

:The problem with visual programming is that you can’t have more than 50 visual primitives on the screen at the same time.&lt;ref name=complangvisualfaq/&gt;

The term was made up by [[Fred Lakin]], after Deutsch made the following comment at a talk on visual programming by [[Scott Kim]] and [[Warren Robinett]]: "Well, this is all fine and well, but the problem with visual programming languages is that you can’t have more than 50 visual primitives on the screen at the same time. How are you going to write an operating system?"&lt;ref name=complangvisualfaq&gt;{{cite web | url = ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/visual-lang/faq | title = Comp.Lang.Visual - Frequently-Asked Questions List | date = 10 March 1998 | website = rtfm.mit.edu | format = FTP | postscript = ; }} {{Cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/visual-lang/faq/|title=The comp.lang.visual FAQ|first = David | last = McIntyre | website = www.faqs.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=logoblocks&gt;{{cite paper | url = http://www.msr-waypoint.com/en-us/um/people/abegel/mit/begel-aup.pdf | title = LogoBlocks: A Graphical Programming Language for Interacting with the World | last = Begel | first = A.  | date = 1996 | location = Cambridge, MA | publisher = MIT Media Lab }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | url = http://ifets.info/journals/8_4/ets_8_4.pdf#page=16 | title = Animatronics, Children and Computation | first = Andrew | last = Sempere }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[language primitive|primitives]] in a visual language are the separate graphical elements used to build a program, and having more of them available at the same time allows the programmer to read more information. This ''limit'' is sometimes cited as an example of the advantage of textual over visual languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | archivedate=2012-04-21 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120421072924/http://hercules.infotech.monash.edu.au/EII-CAC/CAPapers/Weis_RapidPrototypingApp_IEEE_PervasiveComp_2007_pp76-84.pdf | title= Rapid Prototyping  for Pervasive Applications | first1 = Torben | last1 = Weis | first2 = Mirko | last2 = Knoll | first3 = Andreas | last3 = Ulbrich | first4 = Gero | last4 = Mühl | first5 = Alexander | last5 = Brändle | url = http://hercules.infotech.monash.edu.au/EII-CAC/CAPapers/Weis_RapidPrototypingApp_IEEE_PervasiveComp_2007_pp76-84.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out the greater [[information entropy|information density]] of text, and posing a difficulty in scaling the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | url = http://web.media.mit.edu/~anjchang/ti01/ullmer-mill01-tui-framework.pdf | title = Emerging Frameworks for Tangible User Interfaces | first1 = Brygg | last1 = Ullmer | first2 = Hiroshi | last2 = Ishii | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140714225145/http://web.media.mit.edu/~anjchang/ti01/ullmer-mill01-tui-framework.pdf | archivedate = 2014-07-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | title = Token+Constraint Systems for Tangible Interaction with Digital Information. | citeseerx = 10.1.1.90.4969 | first1 = Brygg | last1 = Ullmer | first2 = Hiroshi | last2 = Ishii | first3 = Robert J.

However, criticisms of the limit include that it is not clear whether a similar limit also exists in textual programming languages;&lt;ref name=complangvisualfaq/&gt; and that the limit could be overcome by applying [[Modularity (programming)|modularity]] to visual programming as is commonly done in textual programming.

'''Duck typing''' in computer programming is an application of the [[duck test]]&amp;mdash;"If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck"&amp;mdash;to determine if an [[object (computer science)|object]] can be used for a particular purpose. With normal typing, suitability is determined by an object's type. In duck typing, an object's suitability is determined by the presence of certain [[Method (computer programming)|methods]] and properties, rather than the type of the object itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-duck-typing|title=Glossary — Python 3.7.1 documentation|website=docs.python.org|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Example==
This is a simple example in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] 3 that demonstrates how any object may be used in any context, up until it is used in a way that it does not support.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=Python&gt;
class Duck:
    def fly(self):
        print("Duck flying")

class Airplane:
    def fly(self):
        print("Airplane flying")

class Whale:
    def swim(self):
        print("Whale swimming")

def lift_off(entity):
    entity.fly()

duck = Duck()
airplane = Airplane()
whale = Whale()

lift_off(duck) # prints `Duck flying`
lift_off(airplane) # prints `Airplane flying`
lift_off(whale) # Throws the error `'Whale' object has no attribute 'fly'`
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==In statically typed languages==
Certain usually [[Type system#Static typing|statically typed]] languages such as [[Boo (programming language)|Boo]] and the version 4 release of [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] have extra type annotations&lt;ref&gt;[http://boo.codehaus.org/Duck+Typing Boo: Duck Typing] {{webarchive |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20081006075246/http://boo.codehaus.org/Duck+Typing |date=October 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ericwhite/archive/2008/10/29/anders-hejlsberg-introduces-c-4-0-at-pdc-2008.aspx|title=Anders Hejlsberg Introduces C# 4.0 at PDC 2008|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that instruct the compiler to arrange for type checking of classes to occur at run-time rather than compile time, and include run-time type checking code in the compiled output.

Templates in C++ allow the language to use compile-time duck typing. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/templates-and-duck-typing/184401971|title=Templates and Duck Typing|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other type systems==

===Structural type systems===
Duck typing is similar to, but distinct from [[Structural type system|structural typing]]. Structural typing is a [[Type system#Static typing|static typing]] system that determines type compatibility and equivalence by a type's structure, whereas duck typing is [[Type system#Dynamic typing|dynamic]] and determines type compatibility by only that part of a type's structure that is accessed during [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]].

The [[OCaml]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[Elm (programming language)|Elm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guide.elm-lang.org/core_language.html|title=Core Language · An Introduction to Elm|first=Evan|last=Czaplicki|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Gosu (programming language)|Gosu]] and PureScript languages support structural typing to varying degrees.

===Protocols and Interfaces===
[[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|Protocols and interfaces]] can provide some of the benefits of duck typing, but duck typing is distinct in that no explicit interface is defined. For example, if a third party library implements a class that cannot be modified, a client cannot use an instance of it with an interface unknown to that library even if the class does in fact satisfy the interface requirements. (A common solution to this problem is the [[Adapter pattern]].) Duck typing would allow this. Again, all of an interface must be satisfied for compatibility.

===Templates or generic types===
[[Template metaprogramming|Template]], or [[Generic programming|generic]] functions or methods apply the duck test in a [[Type system#Static typing|static typing]] context; this brings all the advantages and disadvantages of [[Type system#Static and dynamic type checking in practice|static versus dynamic type checking]] in general. Duck typing can also be more flexible in that only the methods ''actually called at run time'' need to be implemented, while templates require implementation of all methods that ''cannot be proven [[Unreachable code|unreachable]] at compile time''.

Examples include the languages [[C++]] and [[D (programming language)|D]] with templates, which developed from [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] generics.

== Duck Typing in scikit-learn project ==
A possible advantage of duck typing over inheritance is used in the API design for scikit-learn. There the interface dictates how the estimator functions are defined and for adding new functions you do not have to inherit any classes. There duck typing helps in decoupling the code from the API design hence making it easier for others to contribute to and extend the existing library. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buitinck|first=Lars|last2=Louppe|first2=Gilles|last3=Blondel|first3=Mathieu|last4=Pedregosa|first4=Fabian|last5=Mueller|first5=Andreas|last6=Grisel|first6=Olivier|last7=Niculae|first7=Vlad|last8=Prettenhofer|first8=Peter|last9=Gramfort|first9=Alexandre|date=2013-09-23|title=API design for machine learning software: experiences from the scikit-learn project|url=https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00856511|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

=== Criticism of the term itself ===
Use of the term "duck typing" has been considered superfluous in light of the fact that other terms, such as [[Late binding|dynamic binding]], express the concept more clearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ericlippert.com/2014/01/02/what-is-duck-typing/comment-page-1/ |title=What is "duck typing"?
 |last=Lippert |first=Eric |date=2 Jan 2014 |website=Fabulous adventures in coding |access-date=25 May 2016 |quote=...&amp;nbsp;the whole idea of duck typing is fundamentally incoherent&amp;nbsp;...'}}&lt;/ref&gt; To proponents of [[static type checking]], duck typing suggests the ''absence'' of typing, making its incorporation of the term ''typing'' appear incoherent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3389">'''ERG theory''' is a theory in [[psychology]] proposed by [[Clayton Alderfer]].
[[File:Alderfer's ERG Theory.jpg|thumb]]

Alderfer further developed [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] by categorizing the hierarchy into his '''ERG theory''' ([[Existence]], [[Coefficient of relationship|Relatedness]] and Growth). The existence group is concerned with providing the basic material existence requirements of humans. They include the items that Maslow considered to be physiological and safety needs. The second group of needs is those of relatedness&amp;nbsp;– the desire people have for maintaining important [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal relationships]]. These social and status desires require interaction with others if they are to be satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification. Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs: an intrinsic desire for [[personal development]]. These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under [[self-actualization]].
Alderfer categorized the lower order needs (Physiological and Safety) into the Existence category. He fit Maslow's interpersonal love and esteem needs into the Relatedness category. The Growth category contained the self-actualization and self-esteem needs. Alderfer also proposed a regression theory to go along with the ERG theory. He said that when needs in a higher category are not met then individuals redouble the efforts invested in a lower category need. For example if self-actualization or [[self-esteem]] is not met then individuals will invest more effort in the relatedness category in the hopes of achieving the higher need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://courses.washington.edu/inde495/lece.htm Design in the Manufacturing Firm syllabus] University of Washington Industrial Engineering course syllabus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6256">In [[category theory]], the concept of an '''element''', or a '''point''', generalizes the more usual [[set theory|set theoretic]] concept of an [[element (mathematics)|element of a set]] to an object of any [[category (mathematics)|category]].  This idea often allows restating of definitions or properties of morphisms (such as [[monomorphism]] or [[product (category theory)|product]]) given by a [[universal property]] in more familiar terms, by stating their relation to elements.  Some very general theorems, such as [[Yoneda's lemma]] and the [[Mitchell embedding theorem]], are of great utility for this, by allowing one to work in a context where these translations are valid.  This approach to category theory, in particular the use of the Yoneda lemma in this way, is due to [[Grothendieck]], and is often called the method of the '''functor of points'''.

==Definition==
Suppose '''C''' is any [[category (mathematics)|category]] and ''A'', ''T'' are two objects of '''C'''.  A ''T''-valued point of ''A'' is simply an arrow &lt;math&gt;p \colon T \to A&lt;/math&gt;.  The set of all ''T''-valued points of ''A'' varies functorially with ''T'', giving rise to the "functor of points" of ''A''; according to the [[Yoneda lemma]], this completely determines ''A'' as an object of '''C'''.

==Properties of morphisms==
Many properties of morphisms can be restated in terms of points.  For example, a map &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a [[monomorphism]] if
: For all maps &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f \circ g = f \circ h&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;g = h&lt;/math&gt;.
Suppose &lt;math&gt;f \colon B \to C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g, h \colon A \to B&lt;/math&gt; in ''C''.  Then ''g'' and ''h'' are ''A''-valued points of ''B'', and therefore monomorphism is equivalent to the more familiar statement
: ''f'' is a monomorphism if it is an [[injective function]] on points of ''B''.
Some care is necessary.  ''f'' is an [[epimorphism]] if the [[dual (category theory)|dual]] condition holds:
: For all maps ''g'', ''h'' (of some suitable type), &lt;math&gt;g \circ f = h \circ f&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;g = h&lt;/math&gt;.
In set theory, the term "epimorphism" is synonymous with "surjection", i.e.
: Every point of ''C'' is the image, under ''f'', of some point of ''B''.
This is clearly not the translation of the first statement into the language of points, and in fact these statements are ''not'' equivalent in general.  However, in some contexts, such as [[abelian categories]], "monomorphism" and "epimorphism" are backed by sufficiently strong conditions that in fact they do allow such a reinterpretation on points.

Similarly, categorical constructions such as the [[product (category theory)|product]] have pointed analogues.  Recall that if ''A'', ''B'' are two objects of '''C''', their product ''A''&amp;times;''B'' is an object such that
: There exist maps &lt;math&gt;p \colon A \times B \to A,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;q \colon A \times B \to B&lt;/math&gt;, and for any ''T'' and maps &lt;math&gt;f \colon T \to A, g \colon T \to B&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a unique map &lt;math&gt;h \colon T \to A \times B&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f = p \circ h&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g = q \circ h&lt;/math&gt;.
In this definition, ''f'' and ''g'' are ''T''-valued points of ''A'' and ''B'', respectively, while ''h'' is a ''T''-valued point of ''A''&amp;times;''B''.  An alternative definition of the product is therefore:
: ''A''&amp;times;''B'' is an object of '''C''', together with projection maps &lt;math&gt;p \colon A \times B \to A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q \colon A \times B \to B&lt;/math&gt;, such that ''p'' and ''q'' furnish a bijection between points of ''A''&amp;times;''B'' and ''pairs of points'' of ''A'' and ''B''.
This is the more familiar definition of the product of two sets.

==Geometric origin==
{{see also|rational point}}
The terminology is geometric in origin; in [[algebraic geometry]], Grothendieck introduced the notion of a [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] in order to unify the subject with [[arithmetic geometry]], which dealt with the same idea of studying solutions to polynomial equations (i.e. [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]]) but where the solutions are not [[complex number]]s but [[rational number]]s, [[integer]]s, or even elements of some [[finite field]].  A scheme is then just that: a scheme for collecting together all the manifestations of a variety defined by the same equations but with solutions taken in different number sets.  One scheme gives a complex variety, whose points are its &lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt;-valued points, as well as the set of &lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Q})&lt;/math&gt;-valued points (rational solutions to the equations), and even &lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{F}_p)&lt;/math&gt;-valued points (solutions [[Equivalence relation|modulo]] ''p'').

One feature of the language of points is evident from this example: it is, in general, not enough to consider just points with values in a single object.  For example, the equation &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; (which defines a scheme) has no [[real numbers|real]] solutions, but it has [[complex numbers|complex]] solutions, namely &lt;math&gt;\pm i&lt;/math&gt;.  It also has one solution modulo 2 and two modulo 5, 13, 29, etc. (all primes that are 1 modulo 4).  Just taking the real solutions would give no information whatsoever.

==Relation with set theory==
The situation is analogous to the case where '''C''' is the category '''Set''', of sets of actual elements.  In this case, we have the "one-pointed" set {1}, and the elements of any set ''S'' are the same as the {1}-valued points of ''S''.  In addition, though, there are the {1,2}-valued points, which are pairs of elements of ''S'', or elements of ''S''&amp;times;''S''.  In the context of sets, these higher points are extraneous: ''S'' is determined completely by its {1}-points.  However, as shown above, this is special (in this case, it is because all sets are iterated [[coproduct]]s of {1}).

{{wikisource|Federal Trade Commission v. Dean Foods Company}}
'''''FTC v. Dean Foods Co.''''', 384 U.S. 597 (1966), is a 1966 decision of the [[United States Supreme Court]] holding that the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) may sue in federal court to obtain a [[preliminary injunction]] to maintain the status quo against the consummation of a merger that the agency persuasively contends violates the antitrust laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=FTC v. Dean Foods Co.|384|597|1966}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, the ''Dean Foods'' case stands for the proposition that a federal agency may, by invoking the "[[All Writs Act]]," seek equitable relief in federal court against a person's threatened action that will substantially interfere with the agency's performance of its statutory duty and thus adversely affect the relevant court's ability to review the agency's ultimate order with respect to the threatened action.

==Facts==
[[Dean Foods]] and Bowman Dairy, two substantial competitors in the sale of milk in the Chicago area, agreed to a merger. Dean was the second largest firm and Bowman the third or fourth, and together they accounted for 23% of milk sales in the area.&lt;ref&gt;See 384 U.S. at 602 ("[A]t the time of the merger, Dean was the third or fourth largest distributor of packaged milk in the Chicago area; Bowman was at least the second largest in that market, and together they enjoyed approximately 23% of the sales of packaged milk in the same area, while the four largest dairy companies had a 43% share thereof.").&lt;/ref&gt; The FTC filed an administrative complaint to prevent the merger and sought to maintain the status quo pending completion of administrative hearings by filing a petition with the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction under the [[All Writs Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|28|1651|a}}. The All Writs Act, part of the first Judiciary Act of 1789 and essentially unchanged since then, empowers the federal courts to "issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law." &lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruling of Seventh Circuit==

The FTC argued that preliminary injunctive relief was needed pending completion of the administrative process in the FTC. According to the agency, otherwise, Dean would eliminate Bowman as a competitive entity by selling off its milk routes, its plants, and its equipment. This would prevent restoration of Dean as an effective competitor if the agency later found the merger unlawful. The FTC maintained that such preemptive action by Dean would effectively deprive the court of appeals of its appellate jurisdiction to review the FTC’s final order, because any order would be meaningless as a practical matter. On that basis, the FTC maintained, the All Writs Act supplied the court of appeals for the area in which the companies operated with jurisdiction to issue preliminary injunctive relief so that a meaningful appeal could later occur.&lt;ref&gt;See 384 U.S. at 600.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seventh Circuit dismissed the petition on the ground that the FTC lacked authority to seek such relief (that is, it had no standing to sue), since Congress had not passed any statute giving the FTC specific authority to seek a preliminary injunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=FTC v. Dean Foods Co. |vol=356 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=481 |pinpoint= |court=[[7th Cir.]] |date=1966 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/356/481/303544/ |accessdate=2018-09-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that point Dean immediately began closing Bowman down and eliminating it as a business.&lt;ref&gt;See 384 U.S. at 599 n.1 ("Since consummation of the merger, all assets of Bowman, with the exception of cash and marketable securities which were exempted from the purchase agreement, have been transferred to Dean. Bowman has ceased dairy operations, and now acts as an investment fund, having received and invested the proceeds of the sale.").&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruling of Supreme Court==

[[File:Tom C. Clark.gif|thumb|150px|right|Justice Clark]]

The Supreme Court (5-4), in an opinion by Justice [[Tom C. Clark]]. recognized that the FTC had several times, without success, asked Congress to pass a law authorizing it to obtain preliminary injunctions in merger cases. The Court said that this did not matter: "Congress neither enacted nor rejected these proposals; it simply did not act on them." In any case, the Court added, nothing has limited the courts' historic powers under the All Writs Act. "We thus hold that the Commission has standing to seek preliminary relief from the Court of Appeals under the circumstances alleged."

[[File:SCOTUS Justice Abe Fortas.jpeg|thumb|150px|right|Justice Fortas]]

Justice [[Abe Fortas]] wrote a strong dissent, saying that such awesome power to interfere with mergers should not be entrusted to the FTC without a specific authorization from Congress. Fortas had been legal advisor to Federated Department Stores, Inc, at the time of its four-month fight with the chairman and co-founder of Bullock's, Inc., which had involved an intra-family proxy fight in which such an injunction had been threatened. Federated eventually acquired Bullock's, but it was forced to compromise with the FTC in a consent decree in which Federated agreed to make no more acquisitions until 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Kalman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=x-Fbl_xE1E0C&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=federated+stores+fortas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qIokZkdtOt&amp;sig=uWZQPKpiD8PKbz2HcygjA3o_CDk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirr6afo9LLAhWHGh4KHSwSAoMQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=federated%20stores%20fortas&amp;f=false {{smallcaps|Abe Fortas: a Biography}}] 157-58, 163-64 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1964/08/21/bullocks-merger-into-federated-is-taking-shape.html?_r=0 ''Bullock's Merger Into Federated Is Taking Shape''], N.Y. {{smallcaps|Times}} (Aug. 21, 1964); {{smallcaps|Devin T.

==Significance and aftermath==

The reasoning of the Court is not limited to the FTC and by its terms would apply with equal force to any other federal agency in similar circumstances. 

However, the principle may be limited to situations of great urgency. In ''FTC v. PepsiCo, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=FTC v. PepsiCo, Inc. |vol=477 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=24 |pinpoint= |court=[[2d Cir.]] |date=1973 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/477/24/1533/ |accessdate=2018-09-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the FTC sought a preliminary injunction against a merger and the Second Circuit denied it. The court said that, under ''Dean Foods'', an injunction can issue only if the Commission can show that "an effective remedial order, once the merger was implemented, would otherwise be virtually impossible, thus rendering the enforcement of any final decree of divestiture futile." The Second Circuit thought that the merger probably violated the antitrust laws but did not believe that effective relief would be “virtually impossible.”

In ''Sampson v. Murray'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Sampson v. Murray|volume=415|page=61|pin=77-78|year=1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held ''Dean Foods'' inapplicable to a stay of a GSA dismissal, stating: "In direct contrast to the claim of the FTC in ''Dean Foods'' that its jurisdiction would be effectively defeated by denial of relief, the Commission here has argued that judicial action interferes with the normal agency processes. And we see nothing in the record to suggest that any judicial review available under the doctrine of ''Service v. Dulles'' would be defeated in the same manner as review in ''Dean Foods''."

In the wake of similar decisions, in 1973 Congress passed specific legislation granting the FTC authority to bring suits in district courts to obtain preliminary injunctions to prevent consummation of mergers pending action before the FTC, under a legal standard requiring likelihoods of success on the merits rather than a defeat of the agency proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|15|53|b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Congress passed the [[Hart-Scott-Rodino Act]], which also created administrative clearance procedures having the effect of delaying consummation of mergers while agency evaluation of the competitive impact took place.

In 1984, the D.C. Circuit relied on ''Dean Foods'' as authority for issuance of an order to compel the FCC to act on a petition that it had allegedly delayed unreasonably in acting upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Telecommunications Research &amp; Action Center v. FCC |vol=750 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=70 |pinpoint= |court=[[D.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6336">{{short description|The science of measuring the pressure and temperature history of a metamorphic or intrusive igneous rocks}}
'''Geothermobarometry''' is the science of measuring the previous pressure and temperature history of a [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] or intrusive [[igneous]] rocks. Geothermobarometry is a combination of ''geobarometry'', where a pressure of mineral formation is resolved, and ''geothermometry'' where a temperature of formation is resolved.

==Methodology==
Geothermobarometry relies upon understanding the temperature and pressure of the formation of  minerals within metamorphic and igneous rocks, and is particularly useful in metamorphic rocks. There are several methods of measuring the temperature or pressure of mineral formation relying on chemical [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] between metamorphic minerals or by measuring the chemical composition of individual minerals.

Thermobarometry relies upon the fact that mineral pairs/assemblages vary their compositions as a function of temperature and pressure. There are numerous extra factors to consider such as oxygen [[fugacity]] and water activity (roughly, the same as concentration). The distribution of component elements between the mineral assemblages is then analysed using an [[electron microprobe]] or [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM).

Data on the geothermometers and geobarometers is derived from both laboratory studies on artificial mineral assemblages, where minerals are grown at known temperatures and pressures and the chemical equilibrium measured directly, and from calibration using natural systems.

For example, one of the best known and most widely applicable geothermometers is the garnet-biotite relationship where the relative proportions of Fe and Mg in garnet and biotite change with increasing temperature, so measurement of the compositions of these minerals to give the Fe-Mg distribution between them allows the temperature of crystallization to be calculated, given some assumptions.

===Assumptions===
In natural systems,  the chemical reactions occur in open systems with unknown geological and chemical histories, and application of geothermobarometers relies on several assumptions that must hold in order for the laboratory data and natural compositions to relate in a valid fashion:

* That the full mineralogical assemblage required for the thermobarometer is present. If not all of the minerals of the reaction are present, or did not equilibrate with each other simultaneously, then any pressures and temperatures calculated for the ideal reaction will deviate from those actually experienced by the rock.
* That chemical equilibrium was achieved to a satisfactory degree. This could be impossible to demonstrate definitively, if the minerals of the thermobarometer assemblage are not all observed in contact with each other.
* That any minerals in a two-mineral barometer or thermometer grew in equilibrium, which is assumed when the minerals are seen to be in contact.
* That the mineral assemblage has not been altered by retrograde metamorphism, which can be assessed using an optical microscope in most cases.
* That certain mineralogical assemblages are present. Without these, the accuracy of a reading may be altered from an ideal, and there may be more error inherent in the measurement.

==Techniques==
Some techniques include:

===Geothermometers===
* Ti saturation content of [[biotite]] mica.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geol.lsu.edu/henry/Research/biotite/TiInBiotiteGeothermometer.htm Ti-in biotite geothermometer, Henry et al. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fe-Mg exchange between [[garnet]]-biotite and garnet-[[amphibole]].
* Mg-Fe systematics in pigeonites and augites &lt;ref&gt;Lindsley &amp; Andersen 1983 - A Two-pyroxene Thermometer; Journal of Geophysical Research, vol. 88&lt;/ref&gt;
* Zr content of [[rutile]], effective for higher temperatures than the Ti-in-biotite thermometer. Requires quartz, rutile, and [[zircon]] to be equilibrated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rpi.edu/~watsoe/research/Watson_etal_CMP06.pdf Crystallization thermometers for zircon and rutile, Watson et al. 2006; Contributions to mineralogy and petrology v. 151&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Titanium in zircon geothermometer |Ti-in-zircon]] crystallization thermometer 
Note that the Fe-Mg exchange thermometers are empirical (laboratory tested and calibrated) as well as calculated based on a theoretical thermodynamic understanding of the components and phases involved. The Ti-in-biotite thermometer is solely empirical and not well understood thermodynamically.

===Geobarometers===
* GASP; an acronym for the assemblage garnet-(Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)-silica([[quartz]])-[[plagioclase]]
* GPMB; an acronym for the assemblage garnet-plagioclase-[[muscovite]]-biotite
* Garnet-Plagioclase-Hornblende-Quartz.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, M.J. and Spear, F.S. (1989): Am. Min. 74:77-84. (Pargasite component)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, M.J. and Spear, F.S. (1990): Am. Min. 75:89-96. (Tschermakite component)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hornblende &lt;ref&gt;Hammerstrom, J.M. and Zen, E.-an. (1986): Am. Min. 71:1297-1313.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, L.S., Grissom, G.C., Peters, E.K., Stowell, H.H. and Sisson, V.B.(1987): Am. Mineral. 72:231-239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, and Rutherford (1989): Geology 17: 837-841.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various mineral assemblages rely more upon pressure than temperature; for example reactions which involve a large volume change. At high pressure, specific minerals assume lower volumes (therefore density increases, as the mass does not change) - it is these minerals which are good indicators of paleo-pressure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5157">'''Greenhouse gas removal''' projects are a type of [[climate engineering]] that seek to remove [[greenhouse gases]] from the atmosphere, and thus they tackle the root cause of [[global warming]].  These techniques either directly remove greenhouse gases, or alternatively seek to influence natural processes to remove greenhouse gases indirectly.  The discipline overlaps with [[carbon capture and storage]] and [[carbon sequestration]], and some projects listed may not be considered to be climate engineering by all commentators, instead being described as [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wigley TM |title=A combined mitigation/geoengineering approach to climate stabilization |journal=Science |volume=314 |issue=5798 |pages=452–4 |date=October 2006 |pmid=16973840 |doi=10.1126/science.1131728 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16973840 |bibcode=2006Sci...314..452W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carbon sequestration==
{{main|Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage|Carbon neutral fuel|Carbon sequestration|Carbon dioxide removal}}
A wide range of techniques for [[carbon sequestration]] exist.  These range from ideas to remove [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] from the atmosphere ([[carbon dioxide air capture]]), flue gases ([[carbon capture and storage]]) and by preventing carbon in [[biomass]] from re-entering the atmosphere, such as with [[Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage]] (BECCS).

==Chlorofluorocarbon photochemistry==
Atmospheric [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC) removal is an idea which suggests using [[lasers]] to break up CFCs, an important family of greenhouse gases, in the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author=Stix, T.H.  |title=Removal of chlorofluorocarbons from the troposphere |booktitle=1993 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science |page=135 |publisher=[[IEEE]] |date=7–9 Jun 1993 |location=Vancouver, BC, Canada |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=593398&amp;isnumber=12731 |doi=10.1109/PLASMA.1993.593398 |isbn=0-7803-1360-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methane removal==
[[Methane]] potentially poses major challenges for remediation.  It is around 20 times as powerful a greenhouse gas as {{CO2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Methane as a Greenhouse Gas CCSP Research Highlight 1 |date=January 2006 |publisher=[[U.S. Climate Change Science Program]] |url=http://www.climatescience.gov/infosheets/highlight1/default.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Large quantities may be outgassed from [[permafrost]] and [[clathrates]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Buffett, B. |author2=Archer, D. |title=Time-dependent response of the marine clathrate reservoir to climatic and anthropogenic forcing |series=Spring |journal=[[American Geophysical Union]] |volume=Meeting 2005 |id=2005AGUSM.U33A..05B |bibcode=2005AGUSM.U33A..05B}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of global warming, notably in the [[Arctic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Methane Release from Arctic Clathrates Could Threaten Global Climate |date=4 June 2008 |publisher=[[International Polar Foundation]] |url=http://www.sciencepoles.org/index.php?/news/methane_release_from_arctic_clathrates_could_threaten_global_climate/&amp;uid=1231&amp;pg=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Production Possibilities Frontier Curve.svg|thumb|220px|right|The production possibilities frontier (PPF) for guns versus butter. Points like ''X'' that are outside the PPF are impossible to achieve. Points such as ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' illustrate the tradeoff between guns and butter: at these levels of production, producing more of one requires producing less of the other. Points located along the PPF curve represent sustainable combinations of each type of production in a world where scarcity is a binding constrain. ''A'', however, is inside of the PPF and represents a combination of output that is not utilizing all available resources.]]
In [[macroeconomics]], the '''guns versus butter model''' is an example of a simple [[production–possibility frontier]]. It demonstrates the relationship between a nation's investment in [[Military budget|defense]] and civilian goods. In this example, a nation has to choose between two options when spending its finite resources. It may buy either guns (invest in defense/military) or butter (invest in production of goods), or a combination of both. This may be seen as an analogy for choices between defense and civilian spending in more complex economies.

The "guns or butter" model is used generally as a simplification of national spending as a part of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. The nation will have to decide which balance of guns versus butter best fulfills its needs, with its choice being partly influenced by the military spending and military stance of potential opponents. Researchers in [[political economy]] have viewed the trade-off between military and [[consumer spending]] as a useful predictor of election success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hibbs |first=Douglas |title=The 2010 Midterm Election for the US House of Representatives |work=CEFOS Working Paper |volume=9 |year=2010 |url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/id/eprint/25918 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
One theory on the origin of the concept comes from [[William Jennings Bryan]]'s resignation as [[United States Secretary of State]] in the [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://political-economy.com/guns-or-butter/ |title=Guns or Butter |website=Political-economy.com |date=2011-11-24 |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the outbreak of [[World War I]], the leading global exporter of [[nitrate]]s for [[gunpowder]] was [[Chile]]. Chile had maintained neutrality during the war and provided nearly all of the US's nitrate requirements. It was also the principal ingredient of chemical fertilizer in farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/ted/nitrate.htm |title=Chile Nitrates Exports |website=American.edu |date=1994-03-09 |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The export product was [[sodium nitrate]], a salt mined in the northern part of Chile which is often called ''[[Chile saltpeter|Chilean saltpeter]].''{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

With substantial popular opinion running against US entry into the war, the Bryan resignation and peace campaign (joined prominently with [[Henry Ford]]'s efforts) became a banner for local versus national interests. However, Bryan was no more pro-German than the infamously nativistic Wilson; his motivation, instead, was to expose and publicize what he considered to be an unconscionable public policy.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The [[National Defense Act of 1916]] directed the president to select a site for the artificial production of nitrates within the United States. It was not until September 1917, several months after the United States entered World War I, that Wilson selected [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], after more than a year of competition among political rivals. A deadlock in the Congress was broken when South Carolina Senator [[Ellison D. Smith]] sponsored the National Defense Act of 1916 that directed "the Secretary of Agriculture to manufacture nitrates for fertilizers in peace and munitions in war at water power sites designated by the President." This was presented by the news media as "guns and butter."{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Quoted use of the term==

Perhaps the best known use of the phrase (in translation) was in [[Nazi Germany]]. In a speech on January 17, 1936, Minister of Propaganda [[Joseph Goebbels]] stated: "We can do without butter, but, despite all our love of peace, not without arms. One cannot shoot with butter, but with guns." Referencing the same concept, sometime in the summer of the same year another Nazi official, [[Hermann Göring]], announced in a speech: "Guns will make us powerful; butter will only make us fat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Columbia World of Quotations |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-231-10298-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

US President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] used the phrase to catch the attention of the national media while reporting on the state of national defense and the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidentprofiles.com/Kennedy-Bush/Lyndon-B-Johnson-Protest-at-home.html#b |title=Protest at home - Lyndon B. Johnson - war, domestic |website=Presidentprofiles.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another use of the phrase was British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s statement, in a 1976 speech she gave at a [[Kensington Town Hall, London|Kensington Town Hall]], in which she said, "The Soviets put guns over butter, but we put almost everything over guns."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=102939 Speech at Kensington Town Hall ("Britain Awake"), Margaret Thatcher Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "Guns Before Butter" by [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]] from their 1979 album ''[[Entertainment!]]'' is about this concept.

[[The Prodigy]]'s 1997 album ''[[The Fat of the Land]]'' has the following text on the fold-out booklet: "We have no butter, but I ask you /Would you rather have butter or guns? /Shall we import lard or steel? Let me tell you /Preparedness makes us powerful. /Butter merely makes us fat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Prodigy-The-Fat-Of-The-Land/release/684749 |title=Prodigy* - The Fat Of The Land (CD, Album) |website=Discogs.com |date=2004-05-31 |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phrase as the title for an episode ("[[Guns Not Butter]]") in season four of the television show ''[[The West Wing]]'' (1999–2006) that focused on the portion of the [[Federal budget (economics)|federal budget]] devoted to [[Aid|foreign aid]].

The concept was also discussed in the 2001 movie [[Baby Boy (film)|Baby Boy]].

The concept is referenced in the title of the song "Gunz n Butter" on ''[[A$AP Rocky]]'''s 2018 album ''[[TESTING]]''.

==The Great Society example==
[[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]] programs in the 1960s, when he was President of the United States, are examples of the guns versus butter model. While Johnson wanted to continue [[New Deal]] programs and expand welfare with his own Great Society programs, he was also involved in both the [[arms race]] of the [[Cold War]] and in the [[Vietnam War]]. These wars put strains on the economy and hampered his Great Society programs.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

This is in stark contrast to President [[Dwight D Eisenhower]]'s own objections to the expansion and endless warfare of the [[military industrial complex|military-industrial complex]]. In his [[Chance for Peace speech|"Chance For Peace" speech]] in 1953, he referred to this very [[trade-off]], giving specific examples:&lt;blockquote&gt;Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This is, I repeat, the best way of life to be found on the road the world has been taking. This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron. ... Is there no other way the world may live?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Günther Storck''' (2&amp;nbsp;October 1938 – 23&amp;nbsp;April 1993) was a [[Conservative Catholics|conservative]] [[Catholic bishop]] from [[Germany]]. He was ordained to the priesthood on 21&amp;nbsp;September 1973 by [[Sedevacantism|sedevacantist]] {{ill|Blasius Kurz|de}}, Roman Catholic [[apostolic prefect]] of [[Yungchow]], [[China]], and consecrated – without permission of [[Pope John Paul&amp;nbsp;II]] – a bishop on 30&amp;nbsp;April 1984, in [[Etiolles]], [[France]], by [[Sedeprivationism|sedeprivationist]] bishop [[Guerard des Lauriers]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Günther Storck was born on 2&amp;nbsp;October 1938 in [[Borken, North Rhine-Westphalia]], as the youngest child of the Storck family, who ran a craft business. The father died early, so that the mother not only had to take charge of the family, but also had to run the business. The young Günther Storck was regarded as mentally very sensitive and highly gifted.

===Academic career===
After his [[Abitur]] (1958) he studied [[classical philology]] and [[German studies]] at universities in [[Münster]], [[Berlin]] and [[Munich]]. For his [[vocation]] to the priesthood he returned to Münster, his bishop's resident city, where he started a degree in [[theology]] at the [[seminary]] {{ill|Collegium Borromaeum|de}} (1962). In the meanwhile he passed his [[state examination]] in [[philology]], [[philosophy]] and theology. He escaped from the beginning influence of [[Vatican&amp;nbsp;II]] on Münster{{r|lauth}} – [[Karl Rahner]], the former council adviser to Cardinal [[Julius Döpfner]],{{r|doepfner}} took over the chair in [[dogmatic theology]] and [[History of Dogmatic Theology|history of dogma]] at the [[University of Münster]] (1967-1971), that [[Joseph Ratzinger]] had recently vacated (1963-1966){{r|rahner}} – to Munich (1967), where he continued his studies at the theological and philosophical faculties of the [[University of Munich]]. Few years later he became [[Research Associate]] of [[Leo Scheffczyk]], which meant that Cardinal Döpfner's allowance to become ordained to the priesthood in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising]] became a remote likelihood, which is why he switched to [[Egg, Switzerland|Egg in Switzerland]] for ordination (21&amp;nbsp;September 1973). The day after he celebrated his [[First Mass]] in [[Damenstiftskirche St.&amp;#8239;Anna]]. He did his [[Doctor of Theology|doctorate in theology]] with a tripartite [[graduate thesis]] on [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]'s ''[[Foundations of the Science of Knowledge|Wissenschaftslehre of 1794/95]]''{{r|fichte}} (first part) and on his ''Wissenschaftslehre of 1804''{{r|fichte2}} (second part); its concluding third part achieves the theological application to the doctrine of the [[Trinity]].

===Death and afterward===
Although many were concerned about the poor health of Bishop Günther Storck - he had been lying in a Munich hospital after a collapse for about a month - so the news of his death on 23&amp;nbsp;April came as a surprise to outsiders. There was a prospect of improvement and arrangements had already been made for a subsequent spa stay. But it turned out differently. Bishop Storck had internal bleeding that could no longer be stopped. Informed about the possibility of premature death, his priests had gathered at his deathbed and a small circle of people who had been especially close to him lately. On Friday, April 30, the solemn [[requiem]] was held for the deceased in [[St.&amp;#8239;Mary's Church, Munich]] – exactly nine years after his consecration as bishop. On the following Monday, 3&amp;nbsp;May, the funeral took place at the [[Westfriedhof (Munich)|Munich West Cemetery]].

The first review of Storck's thesis appeared twenty years after its publication (see [[#Secondary literature|§&amp;nbsp;Secondary literature]]). Seven additional years later, his teacher in philosophy resumed Storck's application of [[transcendental philosophy]]{{r|radrizzani}} to the [[Trinity Doctrine]], claiming that "the absolute difference between the [[God-man (Christianity)|Godmanhood of Jesus]] and the [[Godhead in Christianity|pure essence of God]] should have been worked out": "Godmanhood is not simply the same as the Godhead." Which eventually is confirmed by a [[Revisionist school of Islamic studies|revisionist]] reading of the [[Islamic view of the Trinity|Islamic view]] in [[Quran]]&amp;#8239;[[s:Quran_(Progressive_Muslims_Organization)/5#116-120|5:116–117]]: "One notices the reference to [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]&amp;#8239;[[s:Translation:Matthew#24:36|24:36]]: »Yet no one knows the day or hour when this will be, not the angels in heaven, nor the Son. Only the Father knows.«"{{r|lauth2}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30574">'''Identity fusion''', a psychological construct rooted in [[social psychology]] and [[cognitive anthropology]], is a form of alignment with groups in which members experience a visceral sense of oneness with the group. The construct relies on a distinction between the [[personal self]] and the [[social self]]. The personal self refers to the characteristics that make someone a unique person (e.g., tall, old, intelligent), while the social self pertains to the characteristics that align the person with groups (e.g., American, fraternity brother, student council member, etc.). As the name suggests, identity fusion involves the union of the personal and social selves. When fusion occurs, both the personal and social selves remain salient and influential but the boundaries between them become highly permeable. In addition, the theory proposes that fused persons come to regard other group members as “family” and develop strong relational ties to them as well as ties to the collective. Therefore, fused persons are not just bound to the collective; they are tied to the individual members of the collective.

The potency of the personal self and relational ties distinguish identity fusion from other forms of alignment with groups, such as “[[group identification]]”. In group identification, allegiance to the collective eclipses the personal self and relational ties to other group members. Because of this, the personal self and relational ties are not as involved in theories of group identification. Identity fusion theorizes that fusion measures should be more predictive of extreme pro-group behavior than previously proposed measures of identification. In fact, there is growing evidence of this. Measures of identity fusion are particularly powerful predictors of personally costly pro-group behaviors, including endorsement of extreme behaviors, such as fighting and dying for the group.&lt;ref name="Swann 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swann|first=W.B.|last2=Gómez|first2=Á.|last3=Seyle|first3=D.

C.|chapter=An integrative theory of intergroup conflict.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[self-categorization theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=J.C.|last2=Oakes|first2=P.J.|last3=Haslam|first3=S.A. |last4=McGarty|first4=C.|date=1994|title=Self and Collective: Cognition and Social Context|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167294205002|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language=en|volume=20|issue=5|pages=454–463|doi=10.1177/0146167294205002}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Like social identity theory, identity fusion theory rests on the distinction between the personal and social identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=W.|title=The Principles of Psychology (2 vols)|date=1890|publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the social identity approach assumes that there is a hydraulic relationship between personal and social identities. That is, the increases in the salience and influence of one identity diminishes the salience and influence of the other. One important implication of this assumption is that as the group identity becomes salient and apt to guide behavior, the personal identity becomes less salient and less likely to guide behavior. In contrast, the theory of identity fusion theory proposes that both the personal and social identities of a person can be salient and influential simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Swann 2012" /&gt;

Social identity theory also suggests that group members are only linked to one another through their allegiance to the collective; theoretically, personal relationships between group members do not foster identification with the group&lt;ref name="Turner 87"&gt;{{cite book|first1=J.C. |last1=Turner |first2=M.A. |last2=Hogg |first3=P.J. |last3=Oakes |first4=S.D. |last4=Reicher |first5=M.S. |last5=Wetherell|title=Rediscovering the social group: self-categorization theory|year=1987|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=9780631148067}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with the exception of one study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hogg|first=M.A.|last2=Hardie|first2=E. A.|date=2016-07-02|title=Social Attraction, Personal Attraction, and Self-Categorization, A Field Study|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/014616729101700209|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=175–180|doi=10.1177/014616729101700209}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In contrast, fused individuals feel deeply connected to other group members as individuals, as well as to the larger group as a whole.  This is reflected in measures of identify fusion. For example, the verbal measure of identity fusion taps feelings of reciprocal strength between the individual and the group (e.g., "I am strong because of my group"; "I would do more for my group than any other group members would do") as well as feelings of oneness with the group (e.g., "I am one with my group"; "My group is me").&lt;ref name="Gomez 2011a" /&gt;

== The four principles ==

The characteristics of identity fusion theory have been summarized in the form of four principles:
# ''Agentic-personal self principle:'' When identity-fused individuals become strongly aligned with a group, they are assumed to maintain an active and agentic personal self, even when the social self is activated. Consistent with this idea, activating the personal self by increasing [[Arousal|physiological arousal]],&lt;ref name="Swann 2010b"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swann|first=W. B.|last2=Gómez|first2=Á.|last3=Huici|first3=C.|last4=Morales|first4=J.F.|last5=Hixon|first5=J.G.|title=Identity fusion and self-sacrifice: Arousal as a catalyst of pro-group fighting, dying, and helping behavior.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0020014|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=99|issue=5|pages=824–841|doi=10.1037/a0020014|pmid=20649370|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or encouraging people to think about how they would react if they were personally threatened,&lt;ref name="Swann 2009" /&gt; may increase the person's endorsement of extreme pro-group sacrifices. In contrast, the social identification perspective assumes that the personal and social selves are hydraulically related to one another. As such, activating the personal self should diminish endorsement of pro-group behavior. However, this was not the case for strongly fused individuals, who actually demonstrated the exact opposite effect.
# ''Identity synergy principle:'' The fact that the personal and social selves can be activated independently raises the possibility that they may combine [[Synergy|synergistically]] to motivate pro-group behavior. Consistent with this possibility, studies have shown that the activation of either the personal self or social self amplifies the willingness of strongly fused persons to behave in a pro-group fashion. For example, activating the personal self by [[Ostracism|ostracizing]] participants from the group based on their personal preferences, or activating the social self by ostracizing participants based on their group membership,&lt;ref name="Gomez 2011b"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gómez|first=Á.|last2=Morales|first2=J.F.|last3=Hart|first3=S.|last4=Vázquez|first4=A.|last5=Swann|first5=W.B.|date=2011-11-01|title=Rejected and Excluded Forevermore, but Even More Devoted|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167211424580|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language=en|volume=37|issue=12|pages=1574–1586|doi=10.1177/0146167211424580}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in the amplification of endorsement of pro-group action for strongly, but not weakly, fused individuals. Thus, unlike social identity theory which assumes that the personal self does not play a role in pro-group behavior, fusion theory holds that pro-group behaviors are motivated by both the personal and social selves and these two types of self-knowledge may sometimes work together.
# ''Relational ties principle:'' The fusion approach assumes that strongly fused persons care not only about their collective ties to the group (as an abstract entity), but also their relationships (real or imagined) with other members of the group.&lt;ref name="Swann 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aron 1992"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aron|first=A.|last2=Aron|first2=E.N.|last3=Smollan|first3=D.|title=Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale and the structure of interpersonal closeness.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.4.596|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=63|issue=4|pages=596–612|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.4.596|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brewer 1996"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brewer|first=M.B.|last2=Gardner|first2=W.|title=Who is this "We"?

Several studies have garnered empirical support for the relational ties principle. Using several interpersonal variations of the classic [[trolley dilemma]], individuals who were strongly fused with their country endorsed saving fellow countrymen by jumping to their deaths in front of a speeding trolley.&lt;ref name="Swann 2010a" /&gt; Moreover, fused participants endorsed pushing aside a fellow countryman who was poised to jump to his death to ultimately benefit the group, and instead jumping themselves.&lt;ref name="Swann 2010a" /&gt; This research suggests that highly fused persons are so strongly aligned with their fellow group members that they would prefer that they themselves die rather than a fellow group member. Additionally, when highly fused individuals learn that other group members might be killed in a hypothetical trolley dilemma, they demonstrate emotional reactions similar to how people react when a family member is in distress. These emotional reactions predicted subsequent endorsements of self-sacrifice for the group.&lt;ref name="Swann 2014b" /&gt; In comparison, the social identity approach assumes that, when the social identity is salient, individuals view their fellow group members as mere interchangeable exemplars of the group (i.e. they evaluate other group members based on their “collective ties” toward the group).
# ''Irrevocability principle:'' The fusion approach assumes that, once developed, fusion will remain largely stable over time. This stability persists even in varying situations. Identity fusion theory proposes that this is due to the strong emotions, beliefs, and intra-relationships experienced by the strongly fused individuals. That is, although the overall fusion of a group of persons may shift in response to powerful situational forces, the rank orderings of individuals within the group will remain stable. Researchers have tested the “once fused, always fused” hypothesis by comparing the temporal stability of fusion-with-country scores for highly fused individuals with those of moderately or weakly fused individuals. The stability coefficients for highly fused participants were significantly higher than the coefficients associated with weakly or moderately fused participants.&lt;ref name="Swann 2012" /&gt; Even when ostracized strongly fused individuals will go to serious lengths to reaffirm their steadfastness to the group.&lt;ref name="Gomez 2011b" /&gt;

== Consequences ==

=== Endorsement of extreme pro-group behaviors ===

Since the experimental study of actual extreme pro-group acts raises large ethical red flags, researchers have largely focused on endorsements of extreme pro-group acts. Several studies have shown that fusion is a robust predictor of willingness to fight and die on behalf of one’s group.&lt;ref name="Gomez 2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swann 2010b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swann 2014a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swann 2014b" /&gt; Other research has examined responses to variations of the [[Trolley problem|trolley dilemma]] adapted for groups. In scenarios that pitted the desire for self-preservation against self-sacrifice for others, strongly fused persons were especially willing to endorse sacrificing their lives for fellow in-group members (but not for out-group members).&lt;ref name="Swann 2010a" /&gt; Using a different approach, researchers examined group members’ reactions to significant group losses and found that highly identified individuals tend to detach themselves from the group following a group failure, whereas strongly fused persons predicted that they would “go down with the ship”. For example, in parallel studies of the 2008 presidential elections in Spain and the United States, people who were strongly fused with their political party internalized both victory and defeat, but highly identified persons internalized only victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buhrmester|first=Michael D.|last2=Gómez|first2=Ángel|last3=Brooks|first3=Matthew L.|last4=Morales|first4=J.

=== Engagement in personally costly, pro-group behaviors ===

In addition to predicting endorsement of extreme pro-group behaviors, research suggests that fusion is a predictor of a variety of personally costly pro-group behaviors in the real world.&lt;ref name="Buhrmester 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buhrmester|first1=M.D|last2=Fraser|first2=W.T.|last3=Lanman|first3=J.A.|last4=Whitehouse|first4=H.|last5=Swann|first5=W.B.|title=When Terror Hits Home: Identity Fused Americans Who Saw Boston Bombing Victims as "Family" Provided Aid|journal=Self and Identity|date=2015|volume=14|issue=3|pages=253–270|doi=10.1080/15298868.2014.992465|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15298868.2014.992465}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of transsexuals considering [[sex reassignment surgery]], individuals strongly fused with their desired sex underwent surgical procedures designed to permanently change their [[Sex organ|primary sex characteristics]]. Weakly fused participants were far less likely to undergo these procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swann|first1=W.B.|last2=Gomez|first2=A.|last3=Vazquez|first3=A.|last4=Guillamon|first4=G.|last5=Segovia|first5=S.|last6=Carillo|first6=B.|title=Fusion with the Cross-Gender Group Predicts Genital Sex Reassignment Surgery|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=2015|volume=44|issue=5|pages=1313–8|doi=10.1007/s10508-014-0470-4|pmid=25666854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional research has shown that fusion could also be a strong predictor of group-directed helping behaviors. In some studies, individuals donated money to the group.&lt;ref name="Swann 2010b" /&gt; In others, they provided social and emotional support to fellow group members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Semnani-Azad|first=Z.|last2=Sycara|first2=K.|last3=Lewis|first3=M.|date=2012|title=Dynamics of helping behavior and cooperation across culture|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6261100/|journal=2012 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS)|pages=525–530|doi=10.1109/CTS.2012.6261100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has also suggested that strongly fused individuals are especially willing to go out of their way to protect the group and maintain its integrity. For instance, strongly fused employees were more likely to report having “[[Whistleblower|blown the whistle]]” sometime during their employment. Presumably, such whistle-blowing activity was motivated by a conviction that their actions would ultimately benefit the group.&lt;ref name="Whistle 2008"&gt;{{cite book|title=Whistle-blowing in organizations|year=2008|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates/Psychology Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0805859898|edition=Revised|first1=M. P|last1=Miceli|first2=J.P.|last2=Near|first3=T. M.|last3=Dworkin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that students who were strongly fused with their university were willing to whistle-blow against a cheating fellow student despite the cost of time, energy, and the possibility of retaliation from the cheater.&lt;ref name="Buhrmester dissertation"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buhrmester|first1=M.D.|title=Understanding the cognitive and affective underpinnings of whistleblowing (Doctoral dissertation)|journal=Retrieved from University of Texas Libraries database|date=2013|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2152/21278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Local versus extended fusion ==

Since [[Charles Darwin]], the willingness of some humans to sacrifice themselves for genetically unrelated members of the same large, diffuse group (such as a religion or a nation) has raised a theoretical challenge. Social psychological perspectives have contended that such sacrifices are motivated by commitment to the larger collective&lt;ref name="Turner 1979" /&gt; whereas anthropological perspectives have contended that such sacrifices are triggered by commitment to other members of the group.&lt;ref name="Atran 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Atran|first=Scott|title=Talking to the enemy : violent extremism, sacred values, and what it means to be human|year=2010|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=1846144124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitehouse 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitehouse|first=Harvey|title=Modes of religiosity : a cognitive theory of religious transmission|year=2004|publisher=Alta Mira Press|location=Walnut Creek, CA. [etc.]|isbn=0759106150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between ''local'' and ''extended'' fusion provides an explanation for these apparently competing explanations. ''Local fusion'' is proposed to occur in relatively small, homogeneous groups whose members attach to each other through direct personal contact (e.g., families or work teams). In contrast, ''extended fusion'' occurs in relatively large groups whose members do not all have personal relationships (e.g., [[Political party|political parties]] or nation states). In extended fusion, even though fused individuals may not actually know all of their fellow group members, they still feel like they know them and even think of them as like family.&lt;ref name="Swann 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Newson 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newson|first1=M.|last2=Buhrmester|first2=M.D.|last3=Whitehouse|first3=H.|title=Explaining Lifelong Loyalty: The Role of Identity Fusion and Self-Shaping Group Events.|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2016|volume=11|issue=8|page=e0160427|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0160427|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160427}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Besta|first1=T.|last2=Gomez|first2=A.|last3=Vázquez|first3=A.|title=Readiness to deny group’s wrongdoing and willingness to fight for its members: the role of Poles’ identity fusion with the country and religious group|journal=Current Issues in Personality Psychology|date=2014|volume=2|issue=1|doi=10.5114/cipp.2014.43101|url=http://www.termedia.pl/Journal/-75/Streszczenie-22857|pages=49–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, identity fusion theory posits that fused people project feelings of relational ties they have with known group members onto unknown group members. The projection of relational ties explains why fused individuals are sometimes willing to make sacrifices for members of large heterogeneous groups that most people would make only for small, tight-knit groups. Through the process of projection, they psychologically transform genetically unrelated individuals into kin.&lt;ref name="Swann 2012" /&gt;

== Mechanisms ==

=== Shared essence ===

Although most fusion research to date has focused on the nature and consequences of fusion, recent research has revealed some starting points for understanding the causes of fusion.&lt;ref name="Swann 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swann 2014a" /&gt; Perceptions of shared essence, the belief that one shares essential core qualities with the group, appears to be a key building block of identity fusion. Perceptions of shared essence arise in different ways in local and extended fusion. In local fusion, individuals have direct experiences with other group members that foster the conclusion that they share essential qualities with those individuals. In extended fusion, the perception of psychological kinship is fostered by the presence of certain characteristics that are perceived as fundamental to who the person is. For example, people are more likely to fuse with large extended groups when they become convinced that members of the group share with them genes or core values, especially if they hold those values sacred.&lt;ref name="Atran 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atran|first=Scott|last2=Ginges|first2=Jeremy|date=2012-05-18|title=Religious and Sacred Imperatives in Human Conflict|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6083/855|journal=Science|language=en|volume=336|issue=6083|pages=855–857|doi=10.1126/science.1216902|issn=0036-8075|pmid=22605762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Invulnerability ===

The ''relational ties'' principle of fusion suggests that highly fused individuals will feel that they and other group members [[Synergy|synergistically]] strengthen each other. This perception of reciprocal strength should foster the perception that together, members of the group are uniquely invulnerable. These feelings of invulnerability may serve to insulate strongly fused individuals from fully recognizing the risks associated with extreme acts. Perceptions of invulnerability have been shown to mediate the effects of fusion on endorsement of pro-group behavior.&lt;ref name="Gomez 2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gomez 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paez|first1=D.|last2=Rime|first2=B.|editor1-last=von Scheve|editor1-first=C.|editor2-last=Salmela|editor2-first=M.|title=Collective emotions|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=204–216|chapter=Collective emotional gatherings. Their impact upon identity fusion, shared beliefs and social integration|isbn=9780199659180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agency ===

The identity synergy principle of fusion assumes that the borders between the personal and social selves are highly permeable for strongly fused individuals. These porous borders encourage people to channel their personal agency into group behavior, raising the possibility that strongly fused individuals will channel their feelings of personal agency into pro-group behavior. Perceptions of agency have been shown to mediate the effect of fusion on pro-group behavior.&lt;ref name="Swann 2010b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gomez 2011a" /&gt;

=== Shared experience ===
A study found that groups that share painful or strong negative experiences can cause visceral bonding, and pro-group behavior.&lt;ref name="WhitehouseJong2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Jong|first2=Jonathan|last3=Buhrmester|first3=Michael D.|last4=Gómez|first4=Ángel|last5=Bastian|first5=Brock|last6=Kavanagh|first6=Christopher M.|last7=Newson|first7=Martha|last8=Matthews|first8=Miriam|last9=Lanman|first9=Jonathan A.|year=2017|title=The evolution of extreme cooperation via shared dysphoric experiences|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=7|pages=44292|doi=10.1038/srep44292|issn=2045-2322|last1=Whitehouse|first1=Harvey|last10=McKay|first10=Ryan|last11=Gavrilets|first11=Sergey|lay-url=https://phys.org/news/2017-03-power-pain-triggers-extreme-self-sacrifice.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[closed monoidal category|symmetric monoidal closed category]], and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be a small category enriched in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt;.

The book derived from his doctoral thesis, ''Numen, Old Men: Contemporary Masculine Spiritualities and the Problem of Patriarchy'' (Equinox Publishers, 2009) proposed that masculine spirituality tends to perpetuate a patriarchal spirituality, and that gay spirituality and queer theory can be a useful way to think about masculinities for all men, gay or straight. He has published extensively on how masculinity functions in contemporary society and, more specifically,  in contemporary religion. He proposes that by questioning the social construction of masculinity in the everyday it is possible to create a more equitable and sustainable society.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Laguerre form''' is generally given as a third degree [[tensor]]-valued form, that can be written as,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L} = (w^{1})^{2} D a_{11} + 2 w^{1}w^{2} D a_{12} + (w^{2})^{2} D a_{22}&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[linguistics]], '''language death''' occurs when a [[language]] loses its [[terminal speaker|last]] [[First language|native speaker]]. By extension, '''language extinction''' is when the language is no longer known, including by [[Second language|second-language]] speakers. Other similar terms include '''linguicide''',&lt;ref name="Stop, revive and survive"&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]], [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/opinion/stop-revive-and-survive/story-e6frgcko-1226385194433 "Stop, revive and survive"], ''The Australian Higher Education'', June 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; the death of a language from natural or political causes, and rarely '''glottophagy''',&lt;ref&gt;Calvet, Jean-Louis. 1974. ''Langue et colonialisme: petit traité de glottophagie.'' Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; the absorption or replacement of a minor language by a major language.

Language death is a process in which the level of a [[Speech community|speech community's]] [[linguistic competence]] in their [[Variety (linguistics)|language variety]] decreases, eventually resulting in no native or fluent speakers of the variety. Language death can affect any language form, including [[dialect]]s. Language death should not be confused with [[language attrition]] (also called language loss), which describes the loss of proficiency in a [[first language]] of an individual.&lt;ref name="Crystal, David 2000"&gt;Crystal, David (2000) ''Language Death''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[modern period]] (c. 1500 CE–present; following the rise of [[colonialism]]), language death has typically resulted from the process of [[cultural assimilation]] leading to [[language shift]] and the gradual abandonment of a native language in favour of a foreign ''[[lingua franca]]'', largely those of [[European colonialism|European countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XxZbhSsqnUQC&amp;pg=PT739|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Language Teaching and Learning|last=Byram|first=Michael|last2=Hu|first2=Adelheid|date=2013-06-26|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1136235531|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HecNAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100|title=Living Through Languages: An African Tribute to René Dirven|last=Walt|first=Christa Van der|date=2007-05-01|publisher=AFRICAN SUN MeDIA|isbn=9781920109707|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sq5pdj2snokC&amp;pg=PA115|title=Mapping Applied Linguistics: A Guide for Students and Practitioners|last=Hall|first=Christopher J.|last2=Smith|first2=Patrick H.|last3=Wicaksono|first3=Rachel|date=2015-05-11|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1136836233|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the 2000s, a total of roughly 7,000 natively spoken languages existed worldwide. Most of these are minor languages in danger of extinction; one estimate published in 2004 expected that some 90% of the currently spoken languages will have become extinct by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4387421/|title=Study by language researcher, David Graddol|date=2004-02-26|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=2012-03-22}} {{cite web|url=http://www.chinasmack.com/stories/90-percent-worlds-languages-extinct-in-41-years/|title=Research by Southwest University for Nationalities College of Liberal Arts|author=Ian on Friday, January 16, 2009 61 comments|date=2009-01-16|publisher=Chinasmack.com|accessdate=2012-03-22}}.

==Types==

Language death is typically the final outcome of [[language shift]] and may manifest itself in one of the following ways:
* Gradual language death: slowly, over a period of time
* Bottom-to-top language death: cessation of the use of language except in special circumstances (e.g. liturgical language) 
* Top-to-bottom language death: when language shift begins in a high-level environment such as the government.
* Radical language death: The disappearance of a language when all speakers of the language cease to speak the language
* Linguicide (also known as sudden death, language genocide, physical language death, biological language death)
* Language attrition: the loss of proficiency in a language at the individual level

The most common process leading to language death is one in which a community of speakers of one [[language]] becomes [[Multilingualism|bilingual]] with another language, and gradually [[Language shift|shifts]] allegiance to the second language until they cease to use their original, [[heritage language]]. This is a process of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] which may be voluntary or may be forced upon a population. Speakers of some languages, particularly regional or minority languages, may decide to abandon them based on economic or utilitarian grounds, in favor of languages regarded as having greater utility or prestige.

Languages with a small, geographically isolated population of speakers can die when their speakers are wiped out by [[genocide]], [[disease]], or [[natural disaster]].

== Definition==
A language is often declared to be dead even before the last native speaker of the language has died. If there are only a few elderly speakers of a language remaining, and they no longer use that language for communication, then the language is effectively dead. A language that has reached such a reduced stage of use is generally considered moribund.&lt;ref name="Crystal, David 2000"/&gt; Half of the spoken languages of the world are not being taught to new generations of children.&lt;ref name="Crystal, David 2000" /&gt; Once a language is no longer a native language—that is, if no children are being socialized into it as their primary language—the process of transmission is ended and the language itself will not survive past the current generations.

Language death is rarely a sudden event, but a slow process of each generation learning less and less of the language, until its use is relegated to the domain of traditional use, such as in poetry and song. Typically the transmission of the language from adults to children becomes more and more restricted, to the final setting that adults speaking the language will raise children who never acquire fluency. One example of this process reaching its conclusion is that of the [[Dalmatian language]].

==Consequences on grammar==
During language loss—sometimes referred to as ''obsolescence'' in the linguistic literature—the language that is being lost generally undergoes changes as speakers make their language more similar to the language that they are shifting to. This process of change has been described by Appel (1983) in two categories, though they are not mutually exclusive. Often speakers replace elements of their own language with something from the language they are shifting toward. Also, if their heritage language has an element that the new language does not, speakers may drop it.

==Language revitalization==
{{Main|Language revitalization}}
Language revitalization is an attempt to slow or reverse language death. Revitalization programs are ongoing in many languages, and have had varying degrees of success.

The [[revival of the Hebrew language]] in [[Israel]] is the only example of a language's acquiring new [[first language]] speakers after it became extinct in everyday use for an extended period, being used only as a [[liturgical language]].&lt;ref&gt;Hinton, Leanne; &amp; Hale, Ken (eds.). 2001. ''The Green Book of Language Revitalization in Practice''. San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the case of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], there is a theory that argues that "the Hebrew revivalists who wished to speak pure Hebrew failed. The result is a fascinating and multifaceted Israeli language, which is not only multi-layered but also multi-sourced. The revival of a clinically dead language is unlikely without cross-fertilization from the revivalists' mother tongue(s)."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]], [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25980525-25192,00.html "Aboriginal languages deserve revival"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923233756/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25980525-25192,00.html |date=2009-09-23 }}, ''The Australian Higher Education'', August 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cases of language revitalization which have seen some degree of success are [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]]  and [[Navajo language|Navajo]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As a response to English linguistic dominance, [[Anglicization#Place names|de-anglicisation]] became a matter of national pride in some places and especially in regions that were once under [[colonialism|colonial]] rule, where vestiges of colonial domination are a sensitive subject.&lt;ref name=ALD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaeilge.org/deanglicising.html|title=The Necessity for De-Anglicizing Ireland|first=Douglas|last=Hyde|date=25 November 1892|accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= De-Anglicization - Free Online Dictionary|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/de-anglicization| publisher= |accessdate= | quote=the elimination of English influence, language, customs, etc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following centuries of [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|English rule in Ireland]] and English imposition of the English language, an argument for de-anglicization was delivered before the [[National Literary Society|Irish National Literary Society]] in Dublin, 25 November 1892; "When we speak of 'The Necessity for De-Anglicising the Irish Nation', we mean it, not as a protest against imitating what is best in the English people, for that would be absurd, but rather to show the folly of neglecting what is Irish, and hastening to adopt, pell-mell, and indiscriminately, everything that is English, simply because it is English."&lt;ref name=ALD/&gt; Language was one of the features of Anglicisation in Ireland: although it never died out and became an [[official language]] after independence, Irish had lost its status as the island's principal vernacular to become a minority language during the period of English rule; similarly, in North America [[indigenous language]]s have been replaced by those of the colonists.

According to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], "language reclamation will become increasingly relevant as people seek to recover their cultural autonomy, empower their spiritual and intellectual sovereignty, and improve wellbeing. There are various ethical, aesthetic and utilitarian benefits of language revival—for example, historical justice, diversity and employability, respectively."&lt;ref name="Stop, revive and survive"/&gt;

== Factors that prevent language death ==
Google launched the Endangered Languages Project aimed at helping preserve languages that are at risk of extinction. Its goal is to compile up-to-date information about endangered languages and share the latest research about them.

Anthropologist Akira Yamamoto has identified nine factors that he believes will help prevent language death:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jKHjBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA191&amp;lpg=PA191|title=Language Death|last=Crystal|first=David|date=2014-11-06|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781316124093|location=|pages=191|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# There must be a dominant culture that favors linguistic diversity
# The endangered community must possess an ethnic identity that is strong enough to encourage language preservation
# The creation and promotion of programs that educate students on the endangered language and culture
# The creation of school programs that are both bilingual and bicultural
# For native speakers to receive teacher training
# The endangered speech community must be completely involved 
# There must be language materials created that are easy to use
# The language must have written materials that encompass new and traditional content
# The language must be used in new environments and the areas the language is used (both old and new) must be strengthened

==Dead languages ==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2015}}
Linguists distinguish between language "death" and the process where a language becomes a "dead language" through normal [[language change]], a linguistic phenomenon analogous to [[pseudoextinction]]. This happens when a language in the course of its normal development gradually morphs into something that is then recognized as a separate, different language, leaving the old form with no native speakers. Thus, for example, [[Old English]] may be regarded as a "dead language" although it changed and developed into [[Middle English]], [[Early Modern English]] and [[Modern English]]. Dialects of a language can also die, contributing to the overall language death. For example, the Ainu language is slowly dying - "The UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger lists Hokkaido Ainu as critically endangered with 15 speakers ... and both Sakhalin and Kuril Ainu as extinct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Länsisalmi|first1=Riikka|title=NORTHERN VOICES: EXAMINING LANGUAGE ATTITUDES IN RECENT SURVEYS ON AINU AND SAAMI|journal=Studia Orientalia Electronica|date=October 2016|volume=117|pages=429-267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language change ==
The process of language change may also involve the splitting up of a language into a family of several [[daughter language]]s, leaving the common parent language "dead". This has happened to [[Latin]], which (through [[Vulgar Latin]]) eventually developed into the [[Romance languages]], and to [[Prakrit]], which developed into the [[Indo-Aryan languages#New Indo-Aryan|New Indo-Aryan languages]]. Such a process is normally not described as "language death", because it involves an unbroken chain of normal transmission of the language from one generation to the next, with only minute changes at every single point in the chain. Thus with regard to Latin, for example, there is no point at which Latin "died"; it evolved in different ways in different geographic areas, and its modern forms are now identified by a plethora of different names such as French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Romanian, Catalan, Galician, Venetian, etc.

==Measuring language vitality==
Except in case of linguicide, languages do not suddenly become extinct; they become moribund as the community of speakers gradually [[Language shift|shifts]] to using other languages. As speakers shift, there are discernible, if subtle, changes in language behavior. These changes in behavior lead to a change of linguistic vitality in the community.  There are a variety of systems that have been proposed for measuring the vitality of a language in a community. One of the earliest is GIDS (Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale) proposed by [[Joshua Fishman]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Fishman, Joshua. 1991. ''Reversing Language Shift''. Clevendon: Multilingual Matters.&lt;/ref&gt; A noteworthy publishing milestone in measuring language vitality is an entire issue of ''[[Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development]]'' devoted to the study of ethnolinguistic vitality, Vol. 32.2, 2011, with several authors presenting their own tools for measuring language vitality. A number of other published works on measuring language vitality have been published, prepared by authors with varying situations and applications in mind. These include works by [[Arienne Dwyer]],&lt;ref name=Dwyer2009&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dwyer |first=Arienne M. |title=Tools and techniques for endangered-language assessment and revitalization |url=http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/bitstream/1808/7109/1/Dwyer2011_AssessRevitalize.pdf |date=October 23–24, 2009 |location=New York |journal=Trace  Foundation Lecture Series Proceedings: Preprint |format=PDF |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Ehala,&lt;ref&gt;Ehala, Martin. 2009.

'''Laurence Michael Powell''' (born August 26, 1962 in [[Los Angeles, California]]) is a former [[Los Angeles Police Department]] officer. He was one of the five officers involved in the beating of [[Rodney King]] on March 3, 1991.

==Background==
Powell graduated from [[Crescenta Valley High School]]. He later enrolled in the police academy. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/la_riot/article/0,28804,1614117_1614084_1614517,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rodney King incident and trial==
On March 3, 1991, Powell and three other officers, Sgt. [[Stacey Koon]], Officer Theodore Briseno, and Officer Timothy Wind were videotaped repeatedly striking Rodney King with their police batons in [[Lake View Terrace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RODNEY KING BEATING VIDEO Full length footage SCREENER|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb1WywIpUtY|accessdate=28 June 2016|date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officer Powell was partnered with Officer Wind at the time.  

The Los Angeles District Attorney charged the four officers with assault with a deadly weapon and use of excessive force.  A year later, after a change of venue from Los Angeles to [[Ventura County, California|Ventura]] County, a jury of ten whites, one Asian and one Hispanic, acquitted the four officers of the assault charge, but [[Hung jury|deadlocked]] on the excessive force charge for Powell. The verdict led to the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]].

The four officers were later indicted on federal charges for violating Rodney King's civil rights. Powell and Koon were convicted in 1993 and were sentenced to 30 months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-14/news/mn-14959_1_sentencing-guidelines&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1992 song "Guerillas in the Mist" by [[Da Lench Mob]] uses a sample of the phrase "gorillas in the mist" uttered by Powell. The LAPD officer had used the phrase to describe a black family in a domestic dispute that he responded to just before stopping King, named after the 1988 film ''[[Gorillas in the Mist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Eithne. ''Nuthin' but a "G" Thang: The Culture and Commerce of Gangsta Rap''. New York: Columbia University Press, 2005. (See pp. 104-105.)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6341">'''Lumpenbourgeoisie''' is a term used primarily in the context of [[Colonialism|colonial]] and [[neocolonial]] [[elite]]s in [[Latin America]], which became heavily dependent on and supportive of the [[neocolonial]] powers. It is a [[Hybrid word|hybrid]] [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of the [[German language|German]] word ''Lumpen'' ("rags") and the [[French language|French]] word ''[[bourgeoisie]]''.{{clarify|reason=what does it actually mean? this should be in the lead.|date=November 2018}}

==in Latin America in the 1970s==
Lumpenbourgeoisie is a term often attributed to [[Andre Gunder Frank]] in 1972&lt;ref name="Haw"&gt;Kapcia Antoni, Antoni Kapcia, ''Havana: The Making of Cuban Culture'', Berg Publishers, 2005, {{ISBN|1-85973-837-0}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mhHyhaIlRx4C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=lumpenbourgeoisie+coined+frank&amp;source=web&amp;ots=NbTIIxZxOH&amp;sig=YeStIQWHOzLtikzq8hDWKUwdKak&amp;hl=en Google Print, p.15]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hos"&gt;Hosam Aboul-Ela, ''Other South: Faulkner, Coloniality, and the Mariategui Tradition'', Univ of Pittsburgh Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-8229-4314-X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UZXlyfcNOBYC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Lumpenbourgeoisie&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=lQEASM-BIIXaygSV5NzwDg&amp;sig=35pbVNGKn5HFRbu2qQZBz-0CeYg Google Print, p.73]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|a|a|none}} (although the term is already present in [[Paul A. Baran|Paul Baran]]'s ''The Political Economy of Growth'' from 1957) to describe a type of a [[middle class]]&lt;ref name="Haw"/&gt; and [[upper class]]&lt;ref name="sch"&gt;William Edwin Segall, ''School Reform in a Global Society', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7425-2461-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uZkRjQCQaa4C&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=Lumpenbourgeoisie&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=lQEASM-BIIXaygSV5NzwDg&amp;sig=Jb9AvvjstiT4Qr9MW0hrNcvSbVk Google Print p.146]&lt;/ref&gt; (merchants, lawyers, industrialists, etc.);&lt;ref name="Harr"/&gt; one who  has little collective self-awareness or economic base&lt;ref name="Haw"/&gt; and who supports the colonial masters.&lt;ref name="Haw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sch"/&gt; The term is most often used in the context of Latin America.&lt;ref name="Hos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harr"&gt;David Harrison, ''The Sociology of Modernization and Development'', Routledge, 1988, {{ISBN|0-415-07870-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=APGrQPfGFg0C&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=Lumpenbourgeoisie&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=lQEASM-BIIXaygSV5NzwDg&amp;sig=GXxbvqewn6vdQXLYBXs0AXzjAtM Google Print, p.83]&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank writing on the origins of the term&lt;ref name="Hos"/&gt; noted that he created this [[neologism]]&lt;ref name="Haw"/&gt; ''lumpenbourgeoisie'' from [[lumpenproletariat]] and bourgeoisie because, although the colonial and neocolonial elites in Latin America were similar to European bourgeoisie on many levels, they had one major difference. This difference was their mentality of the [[Marxist]] lumpenproletariat, the "refuse of all classes" (as described in Marx's ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'') easy to manipulate to support the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system, often turning to [[crime]].&lt;ref name="Hos"/&gt; Similarly, the colonial elites would—although not involved in crime activities—hurt the local economy by aiding the foreign exploiters.&lt;ref name="Hos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Preston"&gt;David Seth Preston, ''Contemporary Issues in Education'', Rodopi, 2005, {{ISBN|90-420-1684-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=h_o65nq6J6oC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=Lumpenbourgeoisie&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=lQEASM-BIIXaygSV5NzwDg&amp;sig=uGtsY6h8Ffcdcb2ErvcAkzazIrM Google Print, p.58]&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign colonial powers want to acquire resources and goods found in the colonies, and they find this facilitated with incorporation of the local elites into the system, as they become intermediaries between the rich colonial buyers and the poor local producers.&lt;ref name="Preston"/&gt; The local elites become increasingly reliant on the system in which they supervise gathering of the [[surplus production]] from the colonies, taking their cut and before the remaining goods are sold abroad.&lt;ref name="Preston"/&gt; Frank termed this economic system ''lumpendevelopment''&lt;ref name="Preston"/&gt; and the countries affected by it, ''lumpenstates''.&lt;ref name="Harr"/&gt;

==Prior usage==
The term Lumpenbourgeoisie was already used in Austria by about 1926. The author was an Austrian social democratic journalist and he used the term in at least one article in a Viennese periodical. Another example of the use of the term was given by Czech philosopher [[Karel Kosík]] in 1997. In his article, ''[http://www.sds.cz/docs/prectete/epubl/kko_lavd.htm Lumpenburžoazie a vyšší duchovní pravda]'' ("Lumpenbourgeoisie and the higher spiritual truth") he defines Lumpenbourgeoisie as "a militant, openly anti-democratic enclave within a functioning, however half-hearted and thus helpless democracy".

"Lumpen-bourgeoisie" also occurs in E. Franklin Frazier's ''The Black Bourgoisie'' (1957), which was translated from the original French text that was published in 1955. He uses it to describe African American businessmen who cling to what he terms the "myth of Negro business" to affect meaningful change in racial politics (173).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazier|first1=E. Franklin|title=Black Bourgeoisie|date=1957|publisher=The Free Press|location=New York|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was especially focused on the development of black-owned business that developed and expanded in both the U.S. South and North during the first decades of the 20th century.

==Notes==
{{Note label|a|a|none}} '''a''' Joseph L. Love wrote that the term is misattributed to Frank and was in fact coined by [[C. Wright Mills]] in ''White Collar'' (1956).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph L. Love, ''Third World' a response to professor Worsley'', Third World Quarterly, Volume 2, Issue 2 April 1980 , pages 315 – 317, [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a785826553~db=all]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the term was popularized by Frank's book ''Lumpenbourgeoisie and Lumpendevelopment: Dependency, Class and Politics in Latin America'' (1972) which used it in its title.

==Works==

===Philosophy===
I. ''Ideals and Aims of [[Interpretation (philosophy)|Interpretation]]''. Michael Krausz’s interests in the theory of interpretation address the following cluster of questions.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, “Interpretation and Its Objects: A Synoptic View,” chap. 2.  In Andreea Deciu Ritivoi, ed., ''Interpretation and Its Objects: Studies in the Philosophy of Michael Krausz''. Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; For such cultural phenomena as works of [[art]], [[music]], [[literature]], and the [[self]], can a single admissible interpretation exist? Or, for such phenomena, can a multiplicity of admissible interpretations exist?&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, ''Rightness and Reasons: Interpretation in Cultural Practices'', Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1993, chap. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; For such phenomena, can opposing interpretations be jointly defended?&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz. “Interpretation and Its Objects,” chap. 7. In Michael Krausz, ed. ''Is There A Single Right Interpretation?'' Philadelphia: Penn State University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Does interpretive activity affect the nature and number of that which is interpreted?&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, ''Rightness and Reasons'', chap. 3, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, ''Interpretation and Transformation: Explorations in Art and the Self''. Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2007, chap. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Does interpretation aim for the elucidation of its objects, the edification of its interpreters, or both?&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, ''Limits of Rightness'', Lanham, Md.: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, 2000, chap. 11&lt;/ref&gt; How does the question of singularity or multiplicity of admissible interpretations bear on the singularity or multiplicity of life paths and projects?&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, ''Interpretation and Transformation'', chap. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Singularism asserts that objects of interpretation always answer to one and only one ideal interpretation.  In contrast, multiplism asserts that objects of interpretation may answer to more than one opposed interpretation. Both singularism and multiplism require that competing interpretations address one and the same object of interpretation. Where different interpretations address different objects of interpretation, an innocuous pluralism occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, ''Rightness and Reasons'', chap. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Where objects of interpretation cannot be delineated as to number, neither singularism nor multiplism can apply.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, ''Interpretation and Transformation'', chap. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Krausz probes the relation between these ideals of interpretation and their ontologies.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, “Interpretation and Its Objects.”&lt;/ref&gt; Singularism and multiplism are each compatible with either [[Philosophical realism|realism]] or [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]]. Singularism does not uniquely [[logical consequence|entail]] realism (and vice versa) and multiplism does not uniquely entail constructivism (and vice versa). Orthodox combinations include singularist-realism and multiplist-constructivism.Heterodox combinations include singularist-constructivism and multiplist-realism.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, “Interpretation and Its Objects.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Krausz affirms that the contest between singularism and multiplism is logically detachable from the contest between realism and constructivism.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, ''Limits of Rightness'', chap. 4,5.&lt;/ref&gt; He further shows that the contest between singularism and multiplism is detachable from a range of other ontologies that fall under the reconciliatory heading of “constructive realism.”&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, ''Limits of Rightness'', chap. 5–9&lt;/ref&gt;  None of the ontologies in Krausz’s inventory of constructive realisms uniquely entails either singularism or multiplism (and vice versa).  Yet Krausz denies that his “detachability thesis” demonstrates that ontology as such is unnecessary for the theory of interpretation.  For the question of the countability of objects of interpretation as well as interpretations themselves is ontological.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz. “Interpretation and Its Objects.”&lt;/ref&gt; Krausz extends the notion of ideals of interpretation to ideals of life paths or projects, such as self-realization.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, ''Interpretation and Transformation'', chap. 9, 10&lt;/ref&gt; That is, directional singularism is the view that for a given person there is one admissible life path, and directional multiplism is the view that for a given person there may be more than one admissible life path. He develops the idea of directional multiplism from a non-essentialist or non-foundational view of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, ''Limits of Rightness'', chap. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

II. ''[[Relativism]]''. In addition, Krausz’s work on relativism canvasses the range and significance of relativistic doctrines and rehearses their virtues and vices.  He considers relativism as the claim that [[truth]], [[good and evil|goodness]], or [[beauty]] (among other values) is relative to some reference frame, and no absolute standards to adjudicate between reference frames exist. He defines and differentiates various strands of [[Universality (philosophy)|absolutism]]: [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[universalism]] and [[foundationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, “Mapping Relativisms,” chap. 1. In Michael Krausz, ed., ''Relativism: A Contemporary Anthology''. New York: Columbia University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Krausz argues that when these strands of absolutism are unwoven, and when relativism is understood as the negation of these strands, classical self-refutation arguments against relativism do not apply.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, “Mapping Relativisms.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, “The Debate,” chap. 1. In Michael Krausz and Rom Harré, eds. Varieties of Relativism. Oxford: Basil Blackwell Publishers, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Krausz considers whether the idea of “undifferentiated [[wikt:unity|unity]]” survives the relativist challenge. He suggests that the assertion of undifferentiated unity, instanced for example in some Asian soteriologies, is compatible with relativism as here he defines it.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, ''Dialogues on Relativism, Absolutism, and Beyond: Four Days in India'', Lanham, Md.: Rowman and Littlefield, 2011, Day Four.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Michael Krausz is the founding Artistic Director and Conductor of the Great Hall Chamber Orchestra at Bryn Mawr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Krausz studied violin with Cleveland Orchestra concertmaster Josef Gingold. He received his early conducting coaching from his father, Laszlo Krausz, noted violist with l'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande and the Cleveland Orchestra, and conductor of the Akron Symphony Orchestra. Frederik Prausnitz of the Peabody Conservatory, and Luis Biava, Resident Conductor Laureate of the Philadelphia Orchestra also coached Michael Krausz. Krausz has been guest conductor of professional orchestras in Bulgaria, including the Pleven, Vratsa and Plovdiv Philharmonic Orchestras.

===Art===
[[File:End of texts3.jpg|thumb|125px|right| &lt;center&gt;End of Texts 35"x26"&lt;/center&gt;]]Michael Krausz has had thirty-three solo and duo shows in galleries in the U.S., U.K., and India, and he has participated in many group exhibitions. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (F.R.S.A.) in 1973. Krausz studied at the Philadelphia College of Art and Haystack Mountain School of Crafts.  He was Resident Fellow at the Ossabaw Foundation. Krausz's artworks have been reproduced in numerous publications including the British journal, ''Leonardo''. He is a member of Artist's Exchange, DE, and Delaware by Hand, which, in 2009, awarded him the status of “Master.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Master Artisans| work =| publisher =Delaware By Hand| date =| url =http://www.delawarebyhand.org/master_artisans.htm| doi =| accessdate =September 27, 2010| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20101120053534/http://delawarebyhand.org/master_artisans.htm| archivedate =November 20, 2010| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krausz's paintings depict various spatial planes at once, embodying scripted messages of no literal significance. They are concerned with the emergence and dissolution of ciphers in infinite spaces. The works embody a kind of automatic writing arising from conductorial musical gestures in meditative spaces. The paintings are done with dry pigment on museum board and other mixed media.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3131">'''Model worker''' ({{zh|s=劳动模范|p=láodòng mófàn}}, abbreviated as 劳模 or '''''láomó''''') is a Communist Chinese political term referring to an exemplary worker who exhibits some or all of the traits appropriate to the ideal of the socialist worker. The idea is similar to the Soviet [[Stakhanovite]] icon.  Model workers are selected in China by central and provincial-level departments. Some cities and large companies also have processes for selecting and praising model workers.

The basic criteria for model workers are [[patriotism]], "worship of science," activities in [[environmental protection]], and the pursuit of excellence.

Model workers are often afforded privileges not available to other citizens or [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] members. "The possibility to become a model worker offered peasants and workers one of the few opportunities for upward mobility other than joining the army," writes scholar Yu Miin-lin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = China Learns from the Soviet Union, 1949-Present (The Harvard Cold War Studies Book Series)|last = Li &amp; Bernstein|first = Hua-Yu &amp; Thomas P.|publisher = Lexington Books|year = 2011|isbn = 0739142232|location = |pages = 254|chapter = “Labor Is Glorious”: Model Laborers in the People's Republic of China}}&lt;/ref&gt; Model workers have an easier time joining the Communist Party, and also to become a higher-level cadre, manager, or other leader.

==Notable model workers==
[[File:Hao Jianxiu in textile mill.jpg|thumb|[[Hao Jianxiu]], model worker in 1951]]
One of the earliest model workers was the teenage textile worker [[Hao Jianxiu]] (awarded 1951), who invented the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method". She was sent to study at [[East China Textile Engineering Institute]] and was elevated to the upper echelon of Chinese politics, serving as Minister of Textile Industry, secretary of the [[CPC Central Secretariat]], and vice chair of the [[National Development and Reform Commission|State Planning Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Lily Xiao Hong |last2=Stefanowska |first2=A.

Another prominent model worker was [[Ni Zhifu]] (awarded 1959), a [[Fitter (occupation)|fitter]] who invented the "Ni Zhifu drill". He was elevated to leadership positions in the municipal governments of [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Tianjin]], and became a member of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China]]. He also served as Chairman of the [[All-China Federation of Trade Unions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politics.people.com.cn/n/2013/0503/c1001-21348753.html |script-title=zh:倪志福同志生平 |trans-title=Biography of Ni Zhifu |work=People's Daily |date=3 May 2013 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A molecube is made of two rotatable halves, one with the microprocessor which represents the intelligence behind the unit, and the other with a motor for rotating the joint. A group of the cubes can be connected into a variety of shapes.

A robot constructed entirely of molecubes would be able to repair itself using extra cubes, and to [[self-replication|create a copy of itself]] using the same number of cubes.

'''Moshé Pinchas Feldenkrais''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: משה פנחס פלדנקרייז, May 6, 1904 – July 1, 1984) was an [[Israel]]i engineer and physicist and the founder of the [[Feldenkrais Method]],which is claimed to improve human functioning by increasing self-awareness through movement; it is not supported by medical evidence.&lt;ref name=aus17/&gt;

Feldenkrais' theory is that "thought, feeling, perception and movement are closely interrelated and influence each other."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsana.ch/en/individuals/all-about-health/relaxation/the-feldenkrais-method All About Health: The Feldenkrais Method] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126004300/http://www.helsana.ch/en/individuals/all-about-health/relaxation/the-feldenkrais-method |date=2016-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born in the [[Russian Empire]] city of [[Slavuta]] (now in [[Ukraine]]) and grew up in [[Baranovichi]], [[Belarus]]. In 1918, he [[aliyah|immigrated]] to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="Who Was Moshe Feldenkrais"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feldenkrais.com/method/frequently_asked_questions/#9|title=Who Was Moshe Feldenkrais?|publisher=Feldenkrais Guild of North America|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080831152550/https://feldenkrais.com/method/frequently_asked_questions/|archivedate=31 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a laborer and obtained his high school diploma from [[Gymnasia Herzliya]] in 1925.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/ben-gurion-s-personal-trainer-1.124885 Ben Gurion's Personal Trainer, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt;  After graduation, he worked as a [[cartography|cartographer]] for the British survey office and began to study self-defense, including [[Ju-Jitsu]]. A soccer injury in 1929 promoted the development of his method in later years.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feldenkraislearning.com/html/about_moshe.html|title=About Moshe|author=Reese, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s, he lived in [[France]], where he earned his engineering degree from the [[École Spéciale des Travaux Publics]] and, later, his [[Doctor of Science]] in [[Physics]] at the [[University of Paris]], where [[Marie Curie]] was one of his teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/.premium-1.663700 The Father of Feldenkrais Dies, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.normandoidge.com/?page_id=1042 The Brain's Way of Healing&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked as a research assistant to nuclear chemist and [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]] at the [[Curie Institute (Paris)|Radium Institute]]. In September 1933, he met [[Jigoro Kano]], the founder of [[judo]] in Paris. Kano encouraged him to study Judo under [[Mikinosuke Kawaishi]]. Feldenkrais became a close friend of Kano and corresponded with him regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buckard|first1=Christian|title=Moshé Feldenkrais: Der Mensch hinter der Methode|date=2015|publisher=Berlin Verlag|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-8270-1238-8|pages=107–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, he earned a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in judo, and later gained his 2nd degree black belt in 1938. He was a co-founding member of the [[List of judo organizations#France|Ju-Jitsu Club de France]], one of the oldest Judo clubs in Europe, which still exists today.  Frédéric and [[Irène Joliot-Curie]] and Bertrand Goldschmidt took Judo lessons from him during their time together at the institute.

On the eve of the Nazi invasion of France in 1940, Feldenkrais fled to Britain with a jar of [[heavy water]] and a sheaf of research material, with instructions to deliver them to the British Admiralty [[War Office]]. Until 1946, he was a science officer in the [[Admiralty]] working on [[anti-submarine weapon]]ry in [[Fairlie, Scotland#MOD base and other facilities|Fairlie, Scotland]].  His work on improving [[sonar]] led to several patents. He also taught self-defense techniques to his fellow servicemen.  On slippery submarine decks, he re-aggravated an old soccer knee injury. Refusing an operation, he was prompted to intently explore and develop self-rehabilitation and awareness techniques by self-observation that later evolved into the method.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt;  His discoveries led him to begin sharing with others (including colleague [[J. D. Bernal]]) through lectures, experimental classes, and one-on-one work with a few.

After leaving the Admiralty, he lived and worked in private industry in London. His self-rehabilitation enabled him to continue his judo practice. From his position on the International Judo Committee, he began to study judo scientifically, incorporating the knowledge that he had gained by self-rehabilitation. In 1949, he published the first book on his method, ''Body and Mature Behavior: A Study of Anxiety, Sex, Gravitation and Learning''. He studied the work of [[Gurdjieff]], [[F. Matthias Alexander]], [[Elsa Gindler]] and [[William Bates (physician)|William Bates]]. He also traveled to Switzerland to study with [[Heinrich Jacoby]].

In 1951, he returned to [[Israel]]. In 1954, after directing the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] Department of Electronics for several years, he settled in [[Tel Aviv]] and began to teach his method full-time.&lt;ref name="Berlin Verlag"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buckard|first1=Christian|title=Moshé Feldenkrais: Der Mensch hinter der Methode|date=2015|publisher=Berlin Verlag|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-8270-1238-8|pages=240–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="derstandard.at"&gt;Priesching, Doris.

''Der Standard.''&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1957, he met Mia Segal, who became his assistant and worked with him for thirty years.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt; He also became the personal trainer of  [[David Ben-Gurion]], the [[Prime Minister of Israel]], whom he taught to stand on his head in a yoga pose.&lt;ref name="Berlin Verlag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="derstandard.at"/&gt;

Throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and the 1980, he presented his method in [[Europe]] and in [[North America]] (including an Awareness Through Movement program for human potential trainers at [[Esalen Institute]] in 1972). He trained the first group of 13 teachers in the method from 1969 to 1971 in Tel Aviv. Over the course of four summers, from 1975 to 1978, he trained 65 teachers in [[San Francisco]] at [[Lone Mountain College]] under the auspices of the [[Saybrook Graduate School and Research Center|Humanistic Psychology Institute]]. In 1980, 235 students began his summer teacher-training course at [[Hampshire College]] in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]]. After becoming ill in the fall of 1981, after teaching two of the planned four summers, he stopped teaching publicly.

==Feldenkrais method==
{{main|Feldenkrais method}}

The Feldenkrais is intended to teach better posture and improve quality of life, by means of instruction and gentle manipulation of the body.&lt;ref name=aus17/&gt;

In 2015 the Australian Government's Department of Health published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by health insurance; the Feldenkrais Method was one of 17 therapies evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found. The report notes that there is "a paucity of evidence regarding the effectiveness of Feldenkrais for the improvement of health outcomes for any clinical condition".&lt;ref name=aus17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/0E9129B3574FCA53CA257BF0001ACD11/$File/Natural%20Therapies%20Overview%20Report%20Final%20with%20copyright%2011%20March.pdf |publisher=Australian Government &amp;ndash; Department of Health |format=PDF |author=Baggoley C |title=Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Natural Therapies for Private Health Insurance |year=2015 |laysummary=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/australian-review-finds-no-benefit-to-17-natural-therapies |lay-source=Gavura, S.

'''Natural resources''' are [[resource]]s that exist without actions of humankind. This includes all valued characteristics such as magnetic, gravitational, electrical properties and forces etc. On earth it includes: [[sunlight]], [[atmosphere]], [[water]], [[land]] (includes all minerals) along with all [[vegetation]], [[crops]] and animal life that naturally subsists upon or within the heretofore identified characteristics and substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/natural-resources |title=natural resources - definition of natural resources in English |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |date=2014-04-20 |accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordcentral.com/cgi-bin/student?natural+resource |title=Definition of natural resource -  Student Dictionary |website=Wordcentral.com |date=2012-09-20 |accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investorwords.com/3210/natural_resources.html |title=What is Natural Resources? definition and meaning |website=Investorwords.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/natural-resource |title=Natural resource dictionary definition &amp;#124; natural resource defined |website=Yourdictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particular areas such as [[Fatu Hiva|the rainforest in Fatu-Hiva]] are often characterized by the [[biodiversity]] and [[geodiversity]] existent in their ecosystems. Natural resources may be further classified in different ways. Natural resources are materials and components (something that can be used) that can be found within the environment. Every man-made product is composed of natural resources (at its fundamental level). A '''natural resource''' may exist as a separate entity such as fresh water,  [[air]], and as well as a living organism such as a fish, or it may exist in an alternate form that must be processed to obtain the resource such as [[ore|metal ore]]s, [[rare earth metals]], [[petroleum]], and most forms of energy.

There is much debate worldwide over natural resource allocations, this is particularly true during periods of increasing scarcity and shortages ([[depletion of resources|depletion and overconsumption of resources]]) but also because the exportation of natural resources is the basis .

==Classification==
{{See also|United Nations Framework Classification for Resources}}
There are various methods of categorizing natural resources, these include source of origin, stage of development, and by their renewability.

On the basis of origin, natural resources may be divided into two types:

* ''Biotic'' —  Biotic resources are obtained from the [[biosphere]] (living and organic material), such as [[forest]]s and [[animal]]s, and the materials that can be obtained from them. [[Fossil fuel]]s such as [[coal]] and [[petroleum]] are also included in this category because they are formed from decayed organic matter.
* ''Abiotic'' – Abiotic resources are those that come from non-living, non-organic material. Examples of abiotic resources include [[wikt:land|land]], fresh [[water]], [[air]], [[rare earth metals]] and heavy metals including [[ore]]s such as [[gold]], [[iron]], [[copper]], [[silver]], etc.

Considering their stage of development, natural resources may be referred to in the following ways:

* ''Potential resources'' — Potential resources are those that may be used in the future—for example, [[petroleum]] in sedimentary rocks that, until drilled out and put to use remains a ''potential'' resource
* ''Actual resources'' — Those resources that have been surveyed, quantified and qualified and, are currently used—development, such as [[wood processing]], depends on technology and cost
* ''Reserve resources'' — The part of an actual resource that can be developed profitably in the future
* ''Stock resources'' — Those that have been surveyed, but cannot be used due to lack of technology—for example, [[hydrogen]]

Many natural resources can be categorized as either renewable or non-renewable:

* ''[[Renewable resources]]'' — Renewable resources can be replenished naturally. Some of these resources, like sunlight, air, wind, water, etc., are continuously available and their quantity is not noticeably affected by human consumption. Though many renewable resources do not have such a rapid recovery rate, these resources are susceptible to depletion by over-use. Resources from a human use perspective are classified as renewable so long as the rate of replenishment/recovery exceeds that of the rate of consumption. They replenish easily compared to Non-renewable resources.
* ''[[Non-renewable resources]]'' – Non-renewable resources either form slowly or do not naturally form in the environment. Minerals are the most common resource included in this category. By the human perspective, resources are non-renewable when their rate of consumption exceeds the rate of replenishment/recovery; a good example of this are fossil fuels, which are in this category because their rate of formation is extremely slow (potentially millions of years), meaning they are considered non-renewable. Some resources actually naturally deplete in amount without human interference, the most notable of these being radio-active elements such as uranium, which naturally decay into heavy metals. Of these, the metallic minerals can be re-used by recycling them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/027ns_005.htm?id=mg19426051.200&amp;print=true |title=Earth's natural wealth: an audit |publisher=Science.org.au |date=May 23, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720095945/http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/027ns_005.htm?id=mg19426051.200&amp;print=true |archivedate=July 20, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but coal and petroleum cannot be [[Recycling|recycled]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reason.com/archives/2010/04/27/peak-everything |title=Peak Everything? |publisher=Reason.com |date= April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once they are completely used they take millions of years to replenish.

== Extraction ==

Resource extraction involves any activity that withdraws resources from nature. This can range in scale from the [[traditional economy|traditional use]] of preindustrial societies, to global industry. Extractive industries are, along with agriculture, the basis of the [[primary sector]] of the economy. Extraction produces [[raw material]], which is then processed to [[add value]]. Examples of extractive industries are [[hunting]], [[Animal trapping|trapping]], [[mining]], [[oil and gas drilling]], and [[forestry]]. Natural resources can add substantial amounts to a country's wealth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/16-002-x/2007003/10454-eng.htm |title=EnviroStats: Canada's natural resource wealth at a glance |publisher=Statcan.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; however a sudden inflow of money caused by a resource boom can create social problems including inflation harming other industries ("[[Dutch disease]]") and corruption, leading to inequality and underdevelopment, this is known as the "[[resource curse]]".

Extractive industries represent a large growing activity in many less-developed countries but the wealth generated does not always lead to sustainable and inclusive growth. People often accuse extractive industry businesses as acting only to maximize short-term value, implying that less-developed countries are vulnerable to powerful corporations. Alternatively, host governments are often assumed to be only maximizing immediate revenue. Researchers argue there are areas of common interest where development goals and business cross. These present opportunities for international governmental agencies to engage with the private sector and host governments through revenue management and expenditure accountability, infrastructure development, [[employment creation]], skills and [[enterprise development]] and impacts on children, especially girls and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Evelyn Dietsche|author2=Samantha Dodd|author3=Dan Haglund|author4=Mark Henstridge|author5=Maja Jakobsen|author6=Esméralda Sindou|author7=Caroline Slaven|title=Extractive industries, development and the role of donors - ECONOMIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR PROFESSIONAL EVIDENCE AND APPLIED KNOWLEDGE SERVICES|url=http://www.partnerplatform.org/?wwwszt4b|website=Partberplatform.org|accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong civil society can play an important role in ensuring effective management of natural resources. Norway can serve as a role model in this regard as it has good institutions and open and dynamic public debate with strong civil society actors that provide an effective checks and balances system for government's management of extractive industries.&lt;ref&gt;Indra Overland (2018) ‘Introduction: Civil Society, Public Debate and Natural Resource Management’, in Indra Overland (ed.) Public Brainpower: Civil Society and Natural Resource Management, Cham: Palgrave, pp. 1–22.

==Depletion of resources==
[[File:Windmills D1-D4 - Thornton Bank.jpg|thumb|left|Wind is a natural resource that can be used to generate electricity, as with these 5MW wind turbines in [[Thorntonbank Wind Farm]] {{convert|28|km|0|abbr=on}} off the coast of [[Belgium]]]]

In recent years, the [[depletion of natural resources]] has become a major focus of governments and organizations such as the [[United Nations]] (UN). This is evident in the UN's Agenda 21 Section Two, which outlines the necessary steps for countries to take to sustain their natural resources.&lt;ref name="UN 2002"&gt;{{cite web |title=UN 2002 Earth Summit Agenda 21 The United Nations programme for action from Rio: Section Two – Conservation and Management of Resources for Development, United Nations, Rio |url=https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/res_agenda21_09.shtml |publisher=Un.org |date=12 September 2011 |accessdate=2016-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The depletion of natural resources is considered a [[sustainable development]] issue.&lt;ref name="Schilling"&gt;Schilling M and Chiang L 2011 The effect of natural resources on sustainable development policy: The approach of non-sustainable externalities. Energy Policy 39: 990–998&lt;/ref&gt; The term sustainable development has many interpretations, most notably the Brundtland Commission's 'to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UN 1987 'Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development: Our Common Future' UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements |url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-02.htm |publisher=Un.org |date=12 September 2011 |accessdate= 2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; however in broad terms it is balancing the needs of the planet's people and species now and in the future.&lt;ref name="UN 2002"/&gt; In regards to natural resources, depletion is of concern for sustainable development as it has the ability to degrade current environments&lt;ref&gt;Salvati L and Marco Z 2008 Natural resource depletion and economic performance of local districts: suggestions from a within-country analysis ''Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology''. 15(6): 518–523&lt;/ref&gt; and potential to impact the needs of future generations.&lt;ref name="Schilling"/&gt;

Depletion of natural resources is associated with [[social inequity]]. Considering most biodiversity are located in developing countries,&lt;ref name="cultural"&gt;UNESCO and UNEP 2002 Cultural Diversity and Biodiversity for Sustainable Development, World Summit on Sustainable Development, Johannesburg.&lt;/ref&gt; depletion of this resource could result in losses of [[ecosystem services]] for these countries.&lt;ref name="living planet"&gt;Nellemann C and Corcoran E 2010 Dead Planet, Living Planet- Biodiversity and Ecosystem Restoration for Sustainable Development: A Rapid Response Assessment.

At present, with it being the year of the forest,&lt;ref name="forest"&gt;{{cite web |title=UNEP 2011 International Year of Forests |url=https://www.un.org/en/events/iyof2011/ |date=12 September 2011 |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is particular concern for rainforest regions that hold most of the Earth's biodiversity.&lt;ref name="forest"/&gt; According to Nelson&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nelson 2005 Chapter 3: Drivers of Ecosystem Change: Summary Chapter in Current State and Trends Assessment Millenium Ecosystem Assessment |url=http://www.maweb.org/documents/document.272.aspx.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014132137/http://www.maweb.org/documents/document.272.aspx.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 October 2009 |format=PDF |date=12 September 2011 |accessdate=2016-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; deforestation and degradation affect 8.5% of the world's forests with 30% of the Earth's surface already cropped. If we consider that 80% of people rely on medicines obtained from plants and ¾ of the world's prescription medicines have ingredients taken from plants,&lt;ref name="living planet"/&gt; loss of the world's rainforests could result in a loss of finding more potential life saving medicines.&lt;ref&gt;Clark H cited in
UNESCO and UNEP 2002 Cultural Diversity and Biodiversity for Sustainable Development, World Summit on Sustainable Development, Johannesburg&lt;/ref&gt;

The depletion of natural resources is caused by 'direct drivers of change'&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt; such as [[Mining]], [[petroleum extraction]], [[fishing]] and forestry as well as 'indirect drivers of change' such as demography, economy, society, politics and technology.&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt; The current practice of [[Agriculture]] is another factor causing depletion of natural resources. For example, the depletion of nutrients in the soil due to excessive use of nitrogen&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt; and desertification.&lt;ref name="UN 2002"/&gt;
The depletion of natural resources is a continuing concern for society. This is seen in the cited quote given by [[Theodore Roosevelt]], a well-known conservationist and former United States president, who was opposed to unregulated natural resource extraction.

==Protection==
{{see also|Environmental protection}}
In 1982, the UN developed the [[World Charter for Nature]], which recognized the need to protect nature from further depletion due to human activity. It states that measures must be taken at all societal levels, from international to individual, to protect nature. It outlines the need for sustainable use of natural resources and suggests that the protection of resources should be incorporated into national and international systems of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UN 1982 General Assembly World Charter for Nature: 48th Plenary meeting |url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/37/a37r007.htm  |publisher=United Nations |date=13 September 2011 |accessdate=2016-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To look at the importance of protecting natural resources further, the World Ethic of Sustainability, developed by the [[IUCN]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and the [[UNEP]] in 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fein, J.|date=2003|title=Learning to Care: Education and Compassion|journal=Australian Journal of Environmental Education|volume=19|pages=1–13|url=http://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/314613/fien03.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=May 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; set out eight values for sustainability, including the need to protect natural resources from depletion. Since the development of these documents, many measures have been taken to protect natural resources including establishment of the scientific field and practice of conservation biology and habitat conservation, respectively.

==Management==
{{Main|Natural resource management}}

Natural resource management is a discipline in the management of natural resources such as land, [[water]], [[soil]], [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s—with a particular focus on how management affects [[quality of life]] for present and future generations. Hence, sustainable development is followed according to judicial use of resources to supply both the present generation and future generations.

Management of natural resources involves identifying who has the right to use the resources and who does not for defining the boundaries of the resource.&lt;ref name="Kommers and Mackie"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ostrom E cited in Kommers N and Mackie P 2005 Journalist guide to world resources 2005 World Resources Institute 1-30 |url=http://pdf.wri.org/worldresources_2005_journalist_guide.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Pdf.wri.org | date= | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resources are managed by the users according to the rules governing of when and how the resource is used depending on local condition.&lt;ref name="Managing Ecosystem"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNDP,UNEP, The World Bank and World Resources Institute – The Wealth of the Poor: Managing Ecosystems to Fight Poverty Institute 2005 Chapter 3 The board's role in governance, World Resources 2005 |url=http://www.sc.com.my/eng/html/cg/cg2011/pdf/chapter3.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Sc.com.my |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725052556/http://www.sc.com.my/eng/html/cg/cg2011/pdf/chapter3.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Occupational Personality Questionnaires''', '''OPQ''' or '''OPQ32''', are widely used occupational [[Personality test|personality questionnaires]]. The authors were [[Peter Saville (psychologist)|Saville]] et al., including Roger Holdsworth, Gill Nyfield, Lisa Cramp and Bill Mabey, and they were launched by Saville and Holdsworth Ltd. in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;BPS Review, 1994 and 2007, Occupational Personality Questionnaires, Concept Model, authors P. Saville, R. Holdsworth, G. Nyfield, L. Cramp and W. Mabey&lt;/ref&gt; The series included the first commercially available [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] instrument.

OPQ32 provides an indication of an individual's preferred behavioural style at work; to help employers gauge how a candidate will fit into certain work environments, how they will work with other people and how they will cope with different job requirements. It is now available in more than 30 languages and uses [[item response theory]] to shorten the questionnaire down to under 30 minutes.

The OPQ32 is used in selection, development, [[team building]], [[succession planning]] and organisational change. Independent reviews are available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychtesting.org.uk/test-registration-and-test-reviews/test-reviews.cfm?page=summary&amp;Test_ID=185 Psychtesting.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashridge.org.uk/Website/Content.nsf/wELNPSY/Psychometric+Instruments+-+Occupational+Personality+Questionnaire+(OPQ)?opendocument Ashbridge.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5, 2013, '''Parrish Dennison''' was shot and killed by [[Albuquerque Police Department|Albuquerque police]] officers Perdue, Dedler and Aragon. Dennison was suspected of being one of three people attempting to sell a stolen banjo from the robbery of a local music store. Police fired on Dennison after they alleged that he pointed out a revolver on them. Dennison's mother, Charlotte Ingraham asserts that footage from a helicopter camera shows otherwise. Police video from after the shooting shows Dennison on the ground with a gun in his hand. Since the incident Dennison’s family has filed a lawsuit for a wrongful death. The shooting was ruled as justified by the [[Bernalillo County, New Mexico|Bernalillo County]] District Attorney's Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cruz|first1=Megan|title=Family files wrongful death over 2013 police involved shooting|url=http://www.koat.com/news/family-files-wrongful-death-lawsuit-over-2013-policeinvolved-shooting/31623136|accessdate=5 May 2015|agency=KOAT Albuquerque|publisher=KOAT Albuquerque|date=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A witness to the incident says that Dennison did not point a gun at officers before the shooting, and that Dennison tried to break through a window but bounced off before police fired upon him. The witness said, "He never once pointed the gun at them, nothing… He just hit that window and just bounced back and then boom, boom, boom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Velasquez|first1=Anna|title=Witness: Man didn't point gun at cops before shooting|url=http://www.koat.com/news/new-mexico/albuquerque/Witness-Man-didn-t-point-gun-at-cops-before-shooting/19219550|accessdate=5 May 2015|agency=KOAT Albuquerque|publisher=KOAT Albuquerque|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violence and conflict with colonists were also important causes of the decline of certain indigenous American populations since the 16th century.]]

The population figure of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] before the 1492 voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]] have proven difficult to establish. Scholars rely on archaeological data and written records from settlers from Europe. Most scholars writing at the end of the 19th century estimated that the [[pre-Columbian]] population was as low as 10 million; by the end of the 20th century most scholars gravitated to a middle estimate of around 50 million, with some historians arguing for an estimate of 100 million or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NPoAQRgkrOcC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=pre-Columbian+population+million&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=pre-Columbian%20population%20million&amp;f=false |title=American colonies; Volume 1 of The Penguin history of the United States, History of the United States Series |first=Alan|last=Taylor |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |year=2002 |ISBN=9780142002100 |page=40 |accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contact with the Europeans led to the [[European colonization of the Americas]], in which millions of immigrants from Europe eventually settled in the Americas.

The population of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] and [[Eurasia]]n peoples in the Americas grew steadily, while the indigenous population plummeted. Eurasian diseases such as [[influenza]], [[bubonic plague]] and [[pneumonic plague]]s, [[yellow fever]], [[smallpox]], and [[malaria]] devastated the Native Americans, who did not have immunity to them. Conflict and outright warfare with Western European newcomers and other American tribes further reduced populations and disrupted traditional societies. The extent and causes of the decline have long been a subject of academic debate, along with [[Genocide of indigenous peoples#The question of colonization and genocide in the Americas|its characterization as a genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=David E. Stannard | authorlink=David Stannard | title=American Holocaust: The Conquest of the New World| date=1993-11-18| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/American_Holocaust.html?id=RzFsODcGjfcC |isbn=978-0-19-508557-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population overview==
Given the fragmentary nature of the evidence, even semi-accurate pre-Columbian population figures are impossible to obtain. Scholars have varied widely on the estimated size of the indigenous populations prior to colonization and on the effects of [[European colonization of the Americas|European contact]].&lt;ref name="HainesSteckela"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael R. Haines|author2=Richard H. Steckel|title=A Population History of North America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BPdgiysIVcgC&amp;pg=PA12|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-49666-7|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates are made by extrapolations from small bits of data. In 1976, geographer [[William Denevan]] used the existing estimates to derive a "consensus count" of about 54&amp;nbsp;million people. Nonetheless, more recent estimates still range widely.&lt;ref&gt;20th century estimates in Thornton, p.&amp;nbsp;22; [https://web.archive.org/web/20080305224956/http://www.usna.edu/Users/history/kolp/HH345/PRE1492.HTM Denevan's consensus count]; [http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat0.htm#America recent lower estimates]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041028051334/http://www.usna.edu/Users/history/kolp/HH345/PRE1492.HTM |date=28 October 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using an estimate of approximately 37&amp;nbsp;million people in Mexico, Central and South America in 1492 (including 6&amp;nbsp;million in the [[Aztec Empire]], 5-10 million in the Mayan States, 11 million in what is now [[Brazil]], and 12 million in the [[Inca Empire]]), the lowest estimates give a death toll due from disease of 90% by the end of the 17th century (nine million people in 1650).&lt;ref name="Histoire"&gt;"La catastrophe démographique" (The Demographic Catastrophe"), ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°322, July–August 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin America would match its 15th-century population early in the 19th century; it numbered 17&amp;nbsp;million in 1800, 30&amp;nbsp;million in 1850, 61&amp;nbsp;million in 1900, 105&amp;nbsp;million in 1930, 218&amp;nbsp;million in 1960, 361&amp;nbsp;million in 1980, and 563&amp;nbsp;million in 2005.&lt;ref name=Histoire/&gt; In the last three decades of the 16th century, the population of present-day Mexico dropped to about one&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref name=Histoire/&gt; The [[Maya peoples|Maya]] population is today estimated at six million, which is about the same as at the end of the 15th century, according to some estimates.&lt;ref name=Histoire/&gt;  In what is now Brazil, the indigenous population declined from a pre-Columbian high of an estimated four million to some 300,000.

Historian [[David Henige]] has argued that many population figures are the result of arbitrary formulas selectively applied to numbers from unreliable historical sources. He believes this is a weakness unrecognized by several contributors to the field, and insists there is not sufficient evidence to produce population numbers that have any real meaning. He characterizes the modern trend of high estimates as "pseudo-scientific number-crunching."  Henige does not advocate a low population estimate, but argues that the scanty and unreliable nature of the evidence renders broad estimates inevitably suspect, saying "high counters" (as he calls them) have been particularly flagrant in their misuse of sources.&lt;ref&gt;Henige, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many population studies acknowledge the inherent difficulties in producing reliable statistics, given the scarcity of hard data.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The population debate has often had [[ideological]] underpinnings.&lt;ref name="Krech"&gt;{{cite book| last = Krech III| first = Shepard| title = The ecological Indian: myth and history| url = https://books.google.com/?id=4SVRAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA82| edition = 1| year = 1999| publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.| location = New York| isbn = 0-393-04755-5| pages = 81–84 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Low estimates were sometimes reflective of European notions of cultural and [[racial superiority]]. Historian [[Francis Jennings]] argued, "Scholarly wisdom long held that Indians were so inferior in mind and works that they could not possibly have created or sustained large populations."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jennings|1993|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indigenous population of the Americas in 1492 was not necessarily at a high point and may actually have been in decline in some areas. Indigenous populations in most areas of the Americas reached a low point by the early 20th century. In most cases, populations have since begun to climb.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, pp. xvii, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Noble David Cook, a community of scholars have recently, albeit slowly, "been quietly accumulating piece by piece data on early epidemics in the Americas and their relation to subjugation of native peoples." They now believe that widespread epidemic disease, to which the natives had no prior exposure or resistance, was the primary cause of the massive population decline of the Native Americans.&lt;ref name="NDCook"&gt;Cook, Noble David. ''Born To Die''; Cambridge University Press ;1998; pp. 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier explanations for the population decline of the American natives include the European immigrants' accounts of the brutal practices of the Spanish [[conquistador]]es, as recorded by the Spaniards themselves. This was applied through the [[encomienda]], which was a system ostensibly set up to protect people from warring tribes as well as to teach them the Spanish language and the [[Catholic religion]], but in practice was tantamount to [[serfdom]] and [[slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Junius P.

It took five years for the Taíno rebellion to be quelled by both the [[Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo|''Real Audiencia'']]—through diplomatic sabotage, and through the Indian auxiliaries fighting with the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Anghiera Pietro Martire D'| title = De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera| url = https://books.google.com/?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&amp;pg=PA122| accessdate = 10 July 2010| date = July 2009| publisher = BiblioLife| isbn = 978-1-113-14760-8| page = 199 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] personally eradicated the notion of the encomienda system as a use for slave labour, there were not enough Spanish to have caused such a large population decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = David M.

Many Native Americans viewed their troubles in terms of religious or supernatural causes within their own belief systems.&lt;ref name="Guilmet"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guilmet |first1=George M |last2=Boyd |first2=Robert T |last3=Whited |first3=David L |last4=Thompson |first4=Nile |year=1991 |title=The Legacy of Introduced Disease: The Southern Coast Salish |journal=American Indian Culture and Research Journal |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=1–32 |doi=10.17953/aicr.15.4.133g8x7135072136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after Europeans and enslaved Africans arrived in the New World, bringing with them the infectious diseases of Europe and Africa, observers noted immense numbers of indigenous Americans began to die from these diseases. One reason this death toll was overlooked is that once introduced, the diseases raced ahead of European immigration in many areas. Disease killed a sizable portion of the populations before European written records were made. After the epidemics had already killed massive numbers of natives, many newer European immigrants assumed that there had always been relatively few indigenous peoples. The scope of the epidemics over the years was tremendous, killing millions of people—possibly in excess of 90% of the population in the hardest hit areas—and creating one of "the greatest human catastrophe in history, far exceeding even the disaster of the [[Black Death]] of medieval Europe",&lt;ref name="NDCook"/&gt; which had killed up to one-third of the people in Europe and Asia between 1347 and 1351.

One of the most devastating diseases was [[smallpox]], but other deadly diseases included [[typhus]], [[measles]], [[influenza]], [[bubonic plague]], [[cholera]], [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis]], [[mumps]], [[yellow fever]] and [[pertussis]], which were chronic in Eurasia.&lt;ref name="Horseman"&gt;''The First Horseman: Disease in Human History''; John Aberth; Pearson-Prentice Hall (2007); pp. 47–75(51)&lt;/ref&gt;

This transfer of disease between the Old and New Worlds was later studied as part of what has been labeled the "[[Columbian Exchange]]".

The epidemics had very different effects in different regions of the Americas. The most vulnerable groups were those with a relatively small population and few built-up immunities. Many island-based groups were annihilated. The [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] and [[Arawaks|Arawak]]s of the Caribbean nearly ceased to exist, as did the [[Beothuk]]s of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. While disease raged swiftly through the densely populated empires of [[Mesoamerica]], the more scattered populations of North America saw a slower spread.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Virulence and mortality===
[[virus|Viral]] and [[bacteria]]l diseases that kill victims before the illnesses spread to others tend to flare up and then die out. A more resilient disease would establish an [[Homeostasis|equilibrium]]; if its victims lived beyond [[infection]], the disease would spread further. The [[evolutionary]] process selects against quick lethality, with the most immediately fatal diseases being the most short-lived.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}   A similar evolutionary pressure acts upon victim populations, as those lacking genetic resistance to common diseases die and do not leave descendants, whereas those who are resistant procreate and pass resistant genes to their offspring. For example, in the first fifty years of the sixteenth century, an unusually strong strain{{clarify|reason=what does this mean. There appears to only be one type of spirochete that causes this. Not documented is "two types" of syphilis|date=August 2015}} of [[syphilis]] killed a high proportion of infected Europeans within a few months; over time, however, the disease has become much less virulent.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Thus both infectious diseases and populations tend to evolve towards an equilibrium in which the common diseases are non-symptomatic, mild or manageably chronic.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}  When a population that has been relatively isolated is exposed to new diseases, it has no resistance to the new diseases (the population is "biologically naive"). These people die at a much higher rate, resulting in what is known as a [[virgin soil epidemic|"virgin soil" epidemic]]. Before the European arrival, the Americas had been isolated from the Eurasian-African landmass. The peoples of the Old World had had thousands of years for their populations to accommodate to their common diseases.

The fact that all members of an immunologically naive population are exposed to a new disease simultaneously increases the fatalities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} In populations where the disease is endemic, generations of individuals acquired immunity; most adults had exposure to the disease at a young age. Because they were resistant to reinfection, they are able to care for individuals who caught the disease for the first time, including the next generation of children. With proper care, many of these "[[childhood diseases]]" are often survivable. In a naive population, all age groups are affected at once, leaving few or no healthy caregivers to nurse the sick. With no resistant individuals healthy enough to tend to the ill, a disease may have higher fatalities.

The natives of the Americas were faced with several new diseases at once creating a situation where some who successfully resisted one disease might die from another. Multiple simultaneous infections (e.g., smallpox and typhus at the same time) or in close succession (e.g., smallpox in an individual who was still weak from a recent bout of typhus) are more deadly than just the sum of the individual diseases. In this scenario, death rates can also be elevated by combinations of new and familiar diseases: smallpox in combination with American strains of [[yaws]], for example.

Other contributing factors:

* Native American medical treatments such as [[Sweat lodge|sweat baths]] and cold water immersion (practiced in some areas) weakened some patients and probably increased mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, p. 208; Thornton, p.&amp;nbsp;47.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Europeans brought many diseases with them because they had many more domesticated animals than the Native Americans. [[Domestication]] usually means close and frequent contact between animals and people, which allows diseases of domestic animals to migrate into the human population when the necessary mutations occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Jared Diamond]]| title = Guns, germs, and steel: the fates of human societies| url = https://books.google.com/?id=kLKTa_OeoNIC&amp;pg=PA357| year = 1997| publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company| isbn = 978-0-393-03891-0| page = 357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Eurasian landmass extends many thousands of miles along an east–west axis. Climate zones also extend for thousands of miles, which facilitated the spread of agriculture, domestication of animals, and the diseases associated with domestication. The Americas extend mainly north and south, which, according to the environmental determinist theory popularized by [[Jared Diamond]] in ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'', meant that it was much harder for cultivated plant species, domesticated animals, and diseases to migrate.

===Biological warfare===

When Old World diseases were first carried to the Americas at the end of the fifteenth century, they spread throughout the southern and northern hemispheres, leaving the indigenous populations in near ruins.&lt;ref name="Horseman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook1"&gt;Cook; pp. 205–16&lt;/ref&gt;  No evidence has been discovered that the earliest Spanish colonists and missionaries deliberately attempted to infect the American natives, and some effort was actually made to limit the devastating effects of disease before it killed off what remained of their forced slave labor under their [[encomienda]] system.&lt;ref name="Horseman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook1"/&gt; The cattle introduced by the Spanish contaminated various water reserves which Native Americans dug in the fields to accumulate rain water. In response, the [[Franciscan]]s and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] created public fountains and aqueducts to guarantee access to [[drinking water]].&lt;ref name=Histoire/&gt;  But when the Franciscans lost their privileges in 1572, many of these fountains were not guarded any more and deliberate [[well poisoning]] may have happened.&lt;ref name=Histoire/&gt;  Although no proof of such poisoning has been found, some historians believe the decrease of the population correlates with the end of religious orders' control of the water.&lt;ref name=Histoire/&gt;

In the centuries that followed, accusations and discussions of biological warfare were common. Well-documented accounts of incidents involving both threats and acts of deliberate infection are very rare, but may have occurred more frequently than scholars have previously acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;''Empire of Fortune''; Francis Jennings; W. W. Norton &amp; Company; 1988; pp. 200, 447–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenn"&gt;Fenn, Elizabeth A. [http://www.politicsandthelifesciences.org/Biosecurity_course_folder/readings/fenn.html Biological Warfare in Eighteenth-Century North America: Beyond Jeffery Amherst] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403033815/http://www.politicsandthelifesciences.org/Biosecurity_course_folder/readings/fenn.html |date=3 April 2015 }};  The Journal of American History, Vol. 86, No. 4, March, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the instances likely went unreported, and it is possible that documents relating to such acts were deliberately destroyed,&lt;ref name="Fenn"/&gt; or sanitized.&lt;ref name="Mann"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Cherokee Medicine, Colonial Germs: An Indigenous Nation's Fight Against Smallpox, 1518–1824''; Paul Kelton; University of Oklahoma Press; 2015; pp. 102–05&lt;/ref&gt;  By the middle of the 18th century, colonists had the knowledge and technology to attempt biological warfare with the smallpox virus. They well understood the concept of quarantine, and that contact with the sick could infect the healthy with smallpox, and those who survived the illness would not be infected again. Whether the threats were carried out, or how effective individual attempts were, is uncertain.&lt;ref name="Horseman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;''The Tainted Gift''; Barbara Alice Mann; ABC-CLIO; 2009; pp. 1–18&lt;/ref&gt;

One such threat was delivered by fur trader [[James McDougall (explorer)|James McDougall]], who is quoted as saying to a gathering of local chiefs, "You know the smallpox. Listen: I am the smallpox chief. In this bottle I have it confined. All I have to do is to pull the cork, send it forth among you, and you are dead men. But this is for my enemies and not my friends."&lt;ref name="Stearn"&gt;''The Effect of Smallpox on the Destiny of the Amerindian''; Esther Wagner Stearn, Allen Edwin Stearn; University of Minnesota; 1945; pp. 13–20, 73–94, 97&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, another fur trader threatened [[Pawnee Indians]] that if they didn't agree to certain conditions, "he would let the smallpox out of a bottle and destroy them."  The Reverend [[Isaac McCoy]] was quoted in his ''History of Baptist Indian Missions'' as saying that the white men had deliberately spread smallpox among the Indians of the southwest, including the Pawnee tribe, and the havoc it made was reported to General Clark and the Secretary of War.&lt;ref name="Stearn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chardon"&gt;''Chardon's Journal at Fort Clark, 1834–1839''; Annie Heloise Abel; Books for Libraries Press; 1932; pp. 319, 394&lt;/ref&gt;  Artist and writer [[George Catlin]] observed that Native Americans were also suspicious of vaccination, "They see white men urging the operation so earnestly they decide that it must be some new mode or trick of the pale face by which they hope to gain some new advantage over them."&lt;ref name="Hopkins"&gt;''Princes and Peasants: Smallpox in History''; Donald R. Hopkins; University of Chicago Press; 1983; pp. 270–71&lt;/ref&gt;  So great was the distrust of the settlers that the Mandan chief [[Four Bears]] denounced the white man, whom he had previously treated as brothers, for deliberately bringing the disease to his people.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Blaisdell ed., ''Great Speeches by Native Americans'', p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rotting"&gt;''Rotting Face: Smallpox and the American Indian''; R. G. Robertson; Caxton Press; 2001 pp. 80–83; 298–312&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohn"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Plague and Pestilence: From Ancient Times to the Present''; George C. Kohn; pp. 252–53&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Seven Years' War]], British militia took blankets from their smallpox hospital and gave them as gifts to two neutral [[Lenape]] Indian dignitaries during a peace settlement negotiation, according to the entry in the Captain's ledger, "To convey the Smallpox to the Indians".&lt;ref name="Mann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peckham"&gt;''Pontiac and the Indian Uprising''; Peckham, Howard H.; University of Chicago Press; 1947; pp. 170, 226–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;''Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754–1766''; Anderson, Fred; New York: Knopf; 2000; pp. 541–42, 809 n11; {{ISBN|0-375-40642-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the following weeks, the high commander of the British forces in North America conspired with his Colonel to "Extirpate this Execreble Race" of Native Americans, writing, "Could it not be contrived to send the small pox among the disaffected tribes of Indians? We must on this occasion use every stratagem in our power to reduce them." His Colonel agreed to try.&lt;ref name="Fenn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peckham"/&gt; Most scholars have asserted that the [[1837 Great Plains smallpox epidemic]] was "started among the tribes of the upper Missouri River by failure to quarantine steam boats on the river",&lt;ref name="Stearn"/&gt; and Captain Pratt of the ''St. Peter'' "was guilty of contributing to the deaths of thousands of innocent people. The law calls his offense criminal negligence. Yet in light of all the deaths, the almost complete annihilation of the Mandans, and the terrible suffering the region endured, the label criminal negligence is benign, hardly befitting an action that had such horrendous consequences."&lt;ref name="Rotting"/&gt; However, some sources attribute the 1836–40 epidemic to the deliberate communication of smallpox to Native Americans, with historian Ann F. Ramenofsky writing, "''Variola Major'' can be transmitted through contaminated articles such as clothing or blankets. In the nineteenth century, the U. S. Army sent contaminated blankets to Native Americans, especially Plains groups, to control the Indian problem."&lt;ref&gt;''Vectors of Death: The Archaeology of European Contact''; University of New Mexico Press; 1987; pp.&amp;nbsp;147–48&lt;/ref&gt; Well into the 20th century, deliberate infection attacks continued as Brazilian settlers and miners transported infections intentionally to the native groups whose lands they coveted."&lt;ref name="Cook1"/&gt;

===Vaccination===

After [[Edward Jenner]]'s 1796 demonstration that the [[Smallpox vaccine|smallpox vaccination]] worked, the technique became better known and smallpox became less deadly in the United States and elsewhere. Many colonists and natives were vaccinated, although, in some cases, officials tried to vaccinate natives only to discover that the disease was too widespread to stop. At other times, trade demands led to broken quarantines. In other cases, natives refused vaccination because of suspicion of whites. The first international healthcare expedition in history was the [[Balmis Expedition|Balmis expedition]] which had the aim of vaccinating indigenous peoples against [[smallpox]] all along the [[Spanish Empire]] in 1803. In 1831, government officials vaccinated the [[Yankton Sioux]] at [[Lower Sioux Indian Reservation|Sioux Agency]]&lt;!---this link is not exactly one-for-one overlap--&gt;. The [[Santee Sioux Reservation|Santee Sioux]] refused vaccination and many died.&lt;ref name=Krech /&gt;

==Depopulation from European Conquest==

===War and violence===
{{Main article|Spanish colonization of the Americas|American Indian Wars|Arauco War|Chichimeca War|Conquest of the Desert}}
[[File:Leutze, Emanuel — Storming of the Teocalli by Cortez and His Troops — 1848.jpg|Storming of the Teocalli by Cortez and His Troops|right|thumb|Storming of the Teocalli by Cortez and His Troops by [[Emanuel Leutze]]]]
While epidemic disease was a leading factor of the population decline of the American indigenous peoples after 1492, there were other contributing factors, all of them related to European contact and colonization. One of these factors was warfare. According to demographer Russell Thornton, although many lives were lost in wars over the centuries, and war sometimes contributed to the near extinction of certain tribes, warfare and death by other violent means was a comparatively minor cause of overall native population decline.&lt;ref&gt;War not a major cause : Thornton, pp. 47–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the U.S. Bureau of the Census in 1894: "The Indian wars under the government of the United States have been more than 40 in number. They have cost the lives of about 19,000 white men, women and children, including those killed in individual combats, and the lives of about 30,000 Indians. The actual number of killed and wounded Indians must be very much higher than the given... Fifty percent additional would be a safe estimate..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report on Indians taxed and Indians not taxed in the United States (except Alaska)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWkUAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA637|origyear=1894|year=1994|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some disagreement among scholars about how widespread warfare was in pre-Columbian America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = W. D. Rubinstein| title = Genocide: A History| url = https://books.google.com/?id=nMMAk4VwLLwC&amp;pg=PA12| year = 2004| publisher = Pearson Education| isbn = 978-0-582-50601-5| page = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is general agreement that war became deadlier after the arrival of the Europeans and their firearms. The South or Central American infrastructure allowed for thousands of European [[conquistador]]s and tens of thousands of their [[Indian auxiliaries]] to attack the dominant indigenous civilization. Empires such as the [[Inca]]s depended on a highly centralized administration for the distribution of resources. Disruption caused by the war and the colonization hampered the traditional economy, and possibly led to shortages of food and materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ancient.eu/Inca_Government/|title= Inca Government |last= Cartwright |first= Mark |date= Oct 2015 |website= Ancient History Encyclopedia |publisher= Knights of Vatican |access-date= 19 July 2017 |quote= Eventually 40,000 Incas would govern some 10 million subjects speaking over 30 different languages.

{{Main article|Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas#European enslavement of indigenous people|l1=European enslavement of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}

Some Spaniards objected to the [[encomienda]] system, notably [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], who insisted that the Indians were humans with souls and rights. Due to many revolts and military encounters, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] helped relieve the strain on both the Indian laborers and the Spanish vanguards probing the Caribana for military and diplomatic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = David M. Traboulay| title = Columbus and Las Casas: the conquest and Christianization of America, 1492–1566| url = https://books.google.com/?id=7Jmi4Wb1DdsC&amp;pg=PA44| accessdate=11 July 2010 |year = 1994| publisher = University Press of America| isbn = 978-0-8191-9642-2| page = 44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on [[New Laws]] were promulgated in Spain in 1542 to protect isolated natives, but the abuses in the Americas were never entirely or permanently abolished. The Spanish also employed the pre-Columbian draft system called the ''[[Mita (Inca)|mita]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/bolivia/29.htm Bolivia – Ethnic Groups].&lt;/ref&gt; and treated their subjects as something between slaves and [[serfdom|serfs]]. Serfs stayed to work the land; slaves were exported to the mines, where large numbers of them died. In other areas the Spaniards replaced the ruling Aztecs and Incas and divided the conquered lands among themselves ruling as the new [[feudal]] lords with often, but unsuccessful lobbying to the [[viceroys]] of the [[crown of Castile|Spanish crown]] to pay Tlaxcalan war demnities. The infamous [[Bandeirantes]] from [[São Paulo]], adventurers mostly of mixed Portuguese and native ancestry, penetrated steadily westward in their search for Indian [[slavery|slaves]]. Serfdom existed as such in parts of Latin America well into the 19th century, past independence.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===Massacres===

{{see also|California Genocide|Round Valley Settler Massacres of 1856-1859}}

Friar [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] and Antonius Flávio Chesta (Tony Chesta) and other dissenting Spaniards from the colonial period described the manner in which the natives were treated by colonials. This has helped to create an image of the Spanish conquistadores as cruel in the extreme.{{citation needed|reason=sounds very original research|date=December 2014}}

Great revenues were drawn from [[Hispaniola]] so the advent of losing manpower{{clarify|reason="through war?" NATIVE manpower? Shouldn't it state that?|date=May 2013}} didn't benefit the Spanish crown. At best, the reinforcement of vanguards sent by the [[Council of the Indies]] to explore the Caribana country and gather information on alliances or hostilities was the main goal of the local viceroys and their [[adelantado]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Anghiera Pietro Martire D'| title = De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera| url = https://books.google.com/?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&amp;pg=PA122| accessdate=14 July 2010 |date = July 2009| publisher = BiblioLife| isbn = 978-1-113-14760-8| page = 395 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although mass killings and [[wikt:atrocity|atrocities]] were not a significant factor in native depopulation, no mainstream scholar dismisses the sometimes humiliating circumstances now believed to be precipitated by [[civil disorder]] as well as Spanish cruelty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Anghiera Pietro Martire D'| title = De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera| url = https://books.google.com/?id=e7hU_LePtIQC| accessdate=10 July 2010| date = July 2009| publisher = BiblioLife| isbn = 978-1-113-14760-8| page = 198 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Great Inca Rebellion | author=Jay O.

* While some [[California]] tribes were settled on reservations, others were hunted down and massacred by 19th century American settlers.

===Displacement and disruption===
{{main article|Indian removal|Trail of Tears}}

The populations of many Native American peoples were reduced by the common practice of intermarrying with Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/tribes/history/indianblood.htm Indian Mixed-Blood].&lt;/ref&gt; Although many Indian cultures that once thrived are extinct today, their descendants exist today in some of the bloodlines of the current inhabitants of the Americas.

The '''Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012''' (Republic Act No. 10354), informally known as the '''Reproductive Health Law''' or '''RH Law''', is a [[law]] in the [[Philippines]], which guarantees universal access to methods on [[contraception]], fertility control, [[sexual education]], and maternal care.

While there is general agreement about its provisions on maternal and child health, there is great debate on its mandate that the Philippine government and the private sector will fund and undertake widespread distribution of family planning devices such as [[condoms]], [[birth control pill]]s, and [[IUD]]s, as the government continues to disseminate information on their use through all health care centers.

Passage of the legislation was controversial and highly divisive, with tambays, academics, religious institutions, and major political figures declaring their support or opposition while it was pending in the legislature. Heated debates and rallies both supporting and opposing the RH Bill took place nationwide.

The Supreme Court delayed implementation of the law in March 2013 in response to challenges. On April 3,2014, the Court ruled that the law was "not unconstitutional" but struck down eight provisions partially or in full.&lt;ref name="Rappler1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/54946-supreme-court-rh-law-constitutional | title=SC declares RH law constitutional | work=[[Rappler]] | date=April 8, 2014 | accessdate=April 8, 2014 | author=Bernal, Buena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate Policy Brief titled "Promoting Reproductive Health", the history of reproductive health in the Philippines dates back to 1967 when leaders of 12 countries including the Philippines' [[Ferdinand Marcos]] signed the Declaration on Population.&lt;ref name="declaration" /&gt;&lt;ref name=delosreyes02 /&gt; The Philippines agreed that the population problem should be considered as the principal element for long-term economic development. Thus, the Population Commission was created to push for a lower family size norm and provide information and services to lower fertility rates.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

Starting 1967, the [[USAID]] began shouldering 80% of the total family planning commodities (contraceptives) of the country, which amounted to $3 million annually. In 1975, the United States adopted as its policy the [[National Security Study Memorandum 200]]: Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests (NSSM200). The policy gives "paramount importance" to population control measures and the promotion of contraception among 13 populous countries, including the Philippines to control rapid population growth which they deem to be inimical to the sociopolitical national interests of the United States, since the "U.S. economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad", and these countries can produce destabilizing opposition forces against the United States. It recommends the U.S. leadership to "influence national leaders" and that "improved world-wide support for population-related efforts should be sought through increased emphasis on mass media and other population education and motivation programs by the UN, USIA, and USAID.&lt;ref name=nssm200 /&gt;

Different presidents had different points of emphasis. President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] pushed for a systematic distribution of contraceptives all over the country, a policy that was called "coercive", by its leading administrator.&lt;ref name=delosreyes02 /&gt; The [[Cory Aquino|Corazon Aquino]] administration focused on giving couples the right to have the number of children they prefer, while [[Fidel V. Ramos]] shifted from population control to population management. [[Joseph Estrada]] used mixed methods of reducing fertility rates, while [[Rvee Jude A. Olandsca]] focused on mainstreaming [[natural family planning]], while stating that contraceptives are openly sold in the country.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

In 1989, the Philippine Legislators’ Committee on Population and Development (PLCPD) was established, "dedicated to the formulation of viable public policies requiring legislation on population management and socio-economic development".{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} In 2000, the Philippines signed the [[Millennium Declaration]] and committed to attain the MDGs by 2015, including promoting [[gender equality]] and health. In 2003 USAID started its phase out of a 33-year-old program by which free contraceptives were given to the country. Aid recipients such as the Philippines faced the challenge to fund its own contraception program. In 2004 the Department of Health introduced the Philippines Contraceptive Self-Reliance Strategy, arranging for the replacement of these donations with domestically provided contraceptives.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

In August 2010, the government announced a collaborative work with the USAID in implementing a comprehensive marketing and communications strategy in favor of family planning called ''May Plano Sila''.

==== Summary of major provisions ====
The bill mandates the government to "promote, without biases, all effective natural and modern methods of family planning that are medically safe and legal."&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://politics.inquirer.net/politics/view/20110131-317656/RH-bill-OKd-at-House-committee-level |title=RH bill OK’d at House committee level |last1=Dalangin-Fernandez |first1=Lira |date=1 February 2011 |work=politics.inquirer.net |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although abortion is recognized as illegal and punishable by law, the bill states that “the government shall ensure that all women needing care for post-abortion complications shall be treated and counseled in a humane, non-judgmental and compassionate manner”.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

The bill calls for a "multi-dimensional approach" integrates a component of family planning and responsible parenthood into all government anti-poverty programs.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt; Age-appropriate reproductive health and sexuality education is required from grade five to fourth year high school using "life-skills and other approaches."&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

The bill also mandates the [[Department of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|Department of Labor and Employment]] to guarantee the reproductive health rights of its female employees. Companies with fewer than 200 workers are required to enter into partnership with health care providers in their area for the delivery of reproductive health services.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

Employers with more than 200 employees shall provide reproductive health services to all employees in their own respective health facilities. Those with fewer than 200 workers shall enter into partnerships with health professionals for the delivery of reproductive health services. Employers shall inform employees of the availability of family planning. They are also obliged to monitor pregnant working employees among their workforce and ensure they are provided paid half-day prenatal medical leaves for each month of the pregnancy period that they are employed.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

The national government and local governments will ensure the availability of reproductive health care services like family planning and [[prenatal care]].&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

Any person or public official who prohibits or restricts the delivery of legal and medically safe reproductive health care services will be meted penalty by imprisonment or a fine.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

== Support ==

Free choice regarding reproductive health enables people, especially the poor, to have the number of children they want and can feasibly care and provide for. There are several studies cited by those who support the bill:
*Economic studies, especially the experience in Asia,&lt;ref name="SOE2008" /&gt; show that rapid population growth and high fertility rates, especially among the poor, exacerbate poverty and make it harder for the government to address it.&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=adb2004 /&gt;
*Poverty incidence is higher among big families.&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=orbeta2003 /&gt; Smaller families and wider birth intervals could allow families to invest more in each child’s education, health, nutrition and eventually reduce poverty and hunger at the household level&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;
*Studies show that 44% of the pregnancies in the poorest [[Quantile|quintile]] are unanticipated, and among the poorest women who would like to avoid pregnancy, at least 41% do not use any contraceptive method because of lack of information or access&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt; and "among the poorest families, 22% of married women of reproductive age express a desire to avoid pregnancies but are still not using any family planning method"&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;
*Use of contraception, which the [[World Health Organization]] has listed as [[essential medicine]]s,&lt;ref name=Angsioco2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=essentialmed2010 /&gt; will lower the rate of abortions as it has done in other parts of the world, according to the [[Guttmacher Institute]]&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt;
*An SWS survey of 2008 showed that 71% of the respondents are in favor of the bill&lt;ref name=sws2008 /&gt;

== Criticism ==

Opponents of the bill argue that:

*People's freedom to access contraceptives is not restricted by any opposing law, being available in family planning NGOs, stores, etc. The country is not a [[welfare state]]: taxpayer's money should not be used for personal practices that are harmful and immoral; it can be used to inform people of the harm of BCPs.
*The penal provisions constitute a violation of free choice and conscience, and establishes [[religious persecution]]&lt;ref name=ocampo&gt;{{Cite news

President Aquino stated he was not an author of the bill. He also stated that he gives full support to a firm population policy, educating parents to be responsible, providing contraceptives to those who ask for them, but he refuses to promote contraceptive use. He said that his position "is more aptly called responsible parenthood rather than reproductive health".&lt;ref name=pdivarious /&gt;&lt;ref name=tubeza /&gt;

== Economic and demographic premises ==

The Philippines is the 39th most densely populated country, with a density over 335 per square kilometer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/rankings/geography/population_density_persons_per_sq_km_2011_0.html |title=Population density - Persons per sq km 2011 country ranks, By Rank |publisher=Photius.com |date=2011-05-25 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the population growth rate is 1.9% (2010 Census),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://census.gov.ph/data/pressrelease/2012/pr1227tx.html |title=THE 2010 CENSUS OF POPULATION AND HOUSING REVEALS THE PHILIPPINE POPULATION AT 92.34 MILLION |publisher=Census.gov.ph |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1.957% (2010 est. by [[CIA World Factbook]]), or 1.85% (2005–2010 high variant estimate by the UN Population Division, ''World Population Prospects: The 2008 Revision'') coming from 3.1 in 1960.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The 2013 [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) is 3.20 births per woman, from a TFR of 7 in 1960.&lt;ref name=factbook&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rp.html | title= The World Factbook – Philippines | publisher=U.S. Central Intelligence Agency &lt;!-- | accessdate=2013 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the total fertility rate for the richest quintile of the population is 2.0, which is about one third the TFR of the poorest quintile (5.9 children per woman). The TFR for women with college education is 2.3, about half that of women with only an elementary education (4.5 children per woman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=643267&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=63 |title=EU hopes Congress will approve RH bill |last1=Lee Brago |first1=Pia |date=28 December 2010 |publisher=Philippine Star |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressman Lagman states that the bill "recognizes the verifiable link between a huge population and poverty. Unbridled population growth stunts socioeconomic development and aggravates poverty".&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt;

The [[University of the Philippines]] School of Economics presented two papers in support of the bill:  ''Population and Poverty: the Real Score'' (2004), and ''Population, Poverty, Politics and the Reproductive Health Bill'' (2008). According to these economists, which include [[Solita Monsod]], [[Gerardo Sicat]], Cayetano Paderanga, Ernesto M. Pernia, and Stella Alabastro-Quimbo, "rapid population growth and high fertility rates, especially among the poor, do exacerbate poverty and make it harder for the government to address it", while at the same time clarifying that it would be "extreme" to view "population growth as the principal cause of poverty that would justify the government resorting to draconian and coercive measures to deal with the problem (e.g., denial of basic services and subsidies to families with more than two children)". They illustrate the connection between rapid population growth and poverty by comparing the economic growth and population growth rates of Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines, wherein the first two grew more rapidly than the Philippines due to lower population growth rates.&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt; They stressed that "the experience from across Asia indicates that a population policy cum government-funded [family planning] program has been a critical complement to sound economic policy and poverty reduction".&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;

In ''Population and Poverty'', Aniceto Orbeta, Jr., showed that poverty incidence is higher among big families: 57.3% of Filipino families with seven children are in poverty while only 23.8% of families who have two children live below the poverty threshold.&lt;ref name=orbeta2003 /&gt;
[[File:Philippines poverty.png|thumb|right|150px|Percentage of population living below poverty line (2003). Darker areas mean more poverty.]]
Proponents argue that smaller families and wider birth intervals resulting from the use of contraceptives allow families to invest more in each child’s education, health, nutrition and eventually reduce poverty and hunger at the household level.&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt; At the national level, fertility reduction cuts the cost of social services with fewer people attending school or seeking medical care and as demand eases for housing, transportation, jobs, water, food, and other natural resources.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt; The [[Asian Development Bank]] in 2004 also listed a large population as one of the major causes of poverty in the country, together with weak macroeconomic management, employment issues, an underperforming agricultural sector and an unfinished land reform agenda, governance issues including corruption.&lt;ref name=adb2004 /&gt;

=== Criticism of premises ===

Opponents refer to a 2003 study of [[Rand Corporation]], which concluded that "there is little cross-country evidence that population growth impedes or promotes economic growth...population neutralism has in fact been the predominant school in thinking among academics about population growth for the last half-century". For example, the 1992 study of [[Ross Levine]] and David Renelt, which covered 119 countries over 30 years (versus a [[University of the Philippines]] study of 3 countries over a few years). The RAND study also said that a large population can promote growth given the right fundamentals.&lt;ref name=rand2003 /&gt; Thus, they refer to the [[HSBC]] 2012 projection for 2050 that the Philippines will be 16th largest economy due to its large growing population, and those whose populations are decreasing will suffer decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsbcnet.com/gbm/global-insights/insights/2012/wider-world-in-2050.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent development, two authors of the Reproductive Health Bill changed their stand on the provisions of the bill regarding population and development. Reps. Emerciana de Jesus and [[Luzviminda Ilagan]] wanted to delete three provisions which state that "gender equality and women empowerment are central elements of reproductive health and population and development", which integrate responsible parenthood and family planning programs into anti-poverty initiatives, and which name the Population Commission as a coordinating body. The two party-list representatives strongly state that poverty is not due to over-population but because of inequality and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calonzo|first=Andreo|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/222199/nation/2-rh-authors-want-population-control-provisions-scrapped|title=2 RH authors want population control provisions scrapped|publisher=GMA News Online|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' in July 2012 said that Aquino's "promotion of a 'reproductive health' bill is jarring" since it could lead to "a demographic trap of too few workers. The Philippines doesn't have too many people, it has too few pro-growth policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443570904577544542963426800 |title=Review &amp; Outlook: Keeping the Philippine Dream Alive - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2012-07-24 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposing the bill, Former Finance Secretary [[Roberto de Ocampo]] wrote that it is "truly disingenuous for anyone to proceed on the premise that the poor are to blame for the nation’s poverty:. He emphasized that the government should apply the principle of first things first and focus on the root causes of the poverty (e.g., poor governance, corruption) and apply many other alternatives to solve the problem (e.g., giving up [[pork barrel]], raising tax collection efficiency).&lt;ref name=ocampo /&gt;

== Maternal health and deaths ==
Maternal deaths in the Philippines, according to the [[World Health Organization]], is at 5.7 per day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/49029/studies-show-maternal-deaths-in-philippines-in-decline |title=Studies show maternal deaths in Philippines in decline &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-08-28 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; not 10–11 deaths a day, as per the proponents who repeated these numbers "to drive home the point".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CBCP for Life |url=http://cbcpforlife.com/?p=5375 |title=Year-ender report: The crusade for a culture of life, Part 2 |publisher=Cbcpforlife.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=784230&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=64 |title=Pass the RH bill now - FROM THE STANDS By Domini M. Torrevillas - The Philippine Star » News » Opinion |publisher=Philstar.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proponents state that the passage of the RH Bill would mean:
*Access to information on natural and modern family planning
*Improvement of maternal, infant, and child health and nutrition
*Promotion of breast feeding
*Prevention of abortion and management of post-abortion complications
*Improvement of adolescent and youth health
*Prevention and management of reproductive tract infections, HIV/AIDS and other STDs
*Elimination of violence against women
*Counseling on sexuality and sexual and reproductive health
*Treatment of breast and reproductive tract cancers
*Male involvement and participation in reproductive health issues
*Prevention and treatment of infertility
*Reproductive health education for the youth

The Department of Health states that family planning can reduce maternal mortality by about 32%.&lt;ref name=Angsioco2008 /&gt; The bill is "meant to prevent maternal deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth", said Clara Padilla of Engender Rights. She reported that every day, "there are 11 women dying while giving birth in the Philippines. These preventable deaths could have been avoided if more Filipino women have access to reproductive health information and healthcare".{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The key to solving maternal deaths, according to the ''Senate Policy Brief'' on reproductive health, is the establishment of [[birthing center]]s.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

The [[Philippine Medical Association]] (PMA) stated in their Position Paper that the goal of reducing the rise of maternal and child deaths "could be attained by improving maternal and child health care without the necessity of distributing contraceptives. The millions of funds intended for the contraceptive devices may just well be applied in improving the skills of our health workers in reducing maternal and child mortality in the Philippines".&lt;ref name="pmapp" /&gt;

=== Magna Carta for Women ===

Senator Majority Floor Leader [[Tito Sotto]] said that the RH Bill is redundant to a 2009 law referred to as the Magna Carta for Women, which contains reproductive health provisions, asking the Senate to drop the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/230182/news/nation/sotto-asks-senate-to-scrap-redundant-rh-bill |title=Sotto asks Senate to scrap ‘redundant’ RH bill &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; GMA News Online &amp;#124; The Go-To Site for Filipinos Everywhere |publisher=Gmanetwork.com |date=2011-08-22 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unmet need ===

Using data from the 2008 National Demographic and Health Survey, Lagman stated that "Twenty-two percent of married Filipino women have an unmet need for family planning services, an increase by more than one-third since the 2003 National Demographic and Housing Survey". "Our women are having more children than they desire, as seen in the gap between desired fertility (2.5 children) and actual fertility (3.5 children), implying a significant unmet need for reproductive health services", state some [[Ateneo de Manila University]] professors. The Bill provides that "the State shall assist couples, parents and individuals to achieve their desired family size within the context of responsible parenthood for sustainable development and encourage them to have two children as the ideal family size."&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

Writing against the bill, [[Bernardo Villegas]] wrote about the ''Myth of Unmet Family Planning Needs'', citing development economist [[Lant Pritchett]] who said that the term "unmet need" is an elitist construct, an imposition of a need on the poor, disrespectful of their real preferences. Pritchett said that it is "based on a discrepancy...identified by the analyst through the comparison of responses to items in separate blocks of the questionnaire" and is "an inference on the part of the researcher, not a condition reported by the respondents themselves". Pritchett argued this term is applied to women who are not sexually active, are infecund, whose husband is absent, etc., thus bloating the numbers to favor the pharmaceutical companies and those with a population control agenda. Villegas stressed: "Because [the poor] have been deprived of the infrastructures they need, such as farm-to-market roads, [[irrigation]] systems, post-harvest facilities and other support services that the State neglected to provide them, the only economic resources they have are their children". He also challenged that he is willing to bet that if the government will provide cash money to the poor to buy condoms, the poor will use the cash for food and basic needs, thus exploding the myth.&lt;ref name=villegasunmet /&gt;

=== Access ===

One of the main concerns of the proponents is the perceived lack of access to family planning devices such as contraceptives and sterilization. The bill intends to provide universal access through government funding, complementing thus private sector initiatives for family planning services, such as those offered by the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] (IPPF) which supports the Family Planning Organizations of the Philippines and the 97 organizations of the Philippine NGO Council.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[File:Pilule contraceptive.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Combined oral contraceptive pill|Birth control pill]]]]
The UP School of Economics argues, in contrast, that there is lack of access especially for poor people, because contraceptive use is extremely low among them and "among the poorest families, 22% of married women of reproductive age express a desire to avoid pregnancies but are still not using any family planning method".&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt; They say that lack of access leads to a number of serious problems which demand attention: (1) "too many and too {{sic|hide=y|closely|-}}spaced children raises the risk of illness and premature deaths (for mother and child alike)," (2) "the health risks associated with mistimed and unwanted pregnancies are higher for adolescent mothers, as they are more likely to have complications during labor," (3) women who have mistimed pregnancies are "constrained to rely more on public education and health services and other publicly provided goods and services", further complicating limited public resources, (4) families are not able to achieve their desired family size. Thus the UP economists "strongly and unequivocally support" the thrust of the bill to enable "couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information and means to carry out their decisions”.&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt; Proponents argue that government-funded access is the key to breaking the inter-generational poverty that many people are trapped in.&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

=== Natural family planning ===

Proponents of the bill contend that "natural family planning methods have not proven to be as reliable as artificial means of birth control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plcpd.com/rh-in-the-news/rh-bill-authors-agree-to-make-sex-education-optional/ |title=RH bill authors agree to make sex education optional &amp;#124; Philippine Legislators Committee on Population and Development Foundation, Inc |publisher=Plcpd.com |date=2011-03-23 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abortion ==

=== Abortifacient issue ===

According to the RH bill, one of its components is "prevention of abortion and management of post-abortion complications". It provides that "the government shall ensure that all women needing care for post-abortion complications shall be treated and counseled in a humane, non-judgmental and compassionate manner". It also states that "abortion remains a crime and is punishable", as the Constitution declares that “the State shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from [[Fertilisation|conception]]”.&lt;ref name=jlp-law /&gt;

The position of the [[Philippine Medical Association]] (PMA) "is founded strongly on the principle that 'life or conception begins at fertilization' at that moment where there is fusion or union of the sperm and the egg and thus a human person or human being already does exist at the moment of fertilization". The PMA condemns abortifacients that "destroys the fertilized egg or the embryo" and "abhors any procedure...or medication that will interrupt any stage of fertilization and prevents its normal, physiological, uninterrupted growth to adulthood".&lt;ref name="pmapp" /&gt;

Jo Imbong, founder of the Abay Pamilya Foundation, reported that "Lagman said in a House hearing that the bill would protect human life 'from implantation' ",&lt;ref name=Imbong2008 /&gt; and not from fertilization, noting at the same time that the Records of the Constitutional Commission state that “Human life begins at fertilization”.&lt;ref name=Imbong2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CC1986 /&gt;

[[File:Blastocyst, day 5.JPG|thumb|5-day old human embryo called a [[blastocyst]], which comprises 70–100 cells.]]

=== Contraception and abortion relationship ===

Proponents argue that research by the [[Guttmacher Institute]], involved in advancing international reproductive health, reveals that the use of contraceptives can reduce abortion rates by 85%. Proponents such as 14 [[Ateneo de Manila University]] professors, argued thus: "Studies show that the majority of women who go for an abortion are married or in a consensual union (91%), the mother of three or more children (57%), and poor (68%) (Juarez, Cabigon, and Singh 2005). For these women, terminating a pregnancy is an anguished choice they make in the face of severe constraints. When women who had attempted an abortion were asked their reasons for doing so, their top three responses were: they could not afford the economic cost of raising another child (72%); their pregnancy occurred too soon after the last one (57%); and they already have enough children (54%). One in ten women (13%) who had attempted an abortion revealed that this was because her pregnancy resulted from forced sex (ibid.). Thus, for these women, abortion has become a family planning method, in the absence of information on and access to any reliable means to prevent an unplanned and unwanted pregnancy".&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

The bill, said Clara Padilla of EnGender Rights Inc, will "help reduce the number of abortions by providing increased access to information and services on modern contraceptive methods, that in turn will reduce the number of unwanted—and often aborted—pregnancies".&lt;ref name=Padilla2010 /&gt;

Both sides of the debate accuse the other side of deception and misleading the public. The pro-RH people accuse the anti-RH group of misleading the public by calling the bill an abortion bill, when the bill states that abortion remains a crime and is punishable. The anti-RH advocates accuse the RH supporters of hiding from the public the international population control agenda which includes abortion and they refer to U.S. Secretary Hillary Clinton who said that RH includes abortion.&lt;ref name=clintonrep /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=730979&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=64 |title=Jose Sison, Opposing something wrong, Philippine Star |work=The Philippine Star |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fr.

== Contraceptives ==

=== Morality and social effects ===

{{POV section|date=January 2013}}

Fourteen professors from [[Ateneo de Manila University]], a prominent Catholic University, considering the empirical evidence of the dire socioeconomic conditions of the Filipino poor, urged that the bill be passed to help them. They argued: "As Catholics and Filipinos, we share the hope and mission of building a Church of the Poor. We are thus deeply disturbed and saddened by calls made by some members of the Catholic Church to reject a proposed legislation that promises to improve the wellbeing of Filipino families, especially the lives of women, children, adolescents, and the poor". They announced that "Catholic social teachings recognize the primacy of the well-formed conscience over wooden compliance to directives from political and religious authorities", urging Catholic authorities to withdraw their opposition the bill.&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt; Citing Catholic documents and scientific studies, they reasoned that "the RH Bill is pro-life, pro-women, pro-poor, pro-youth, and pro-informed choice". They emphasized that the bill "promotes quality of life, by enabling couples, especially the poor, to bring into the world only the number of children they believe they can care for and nurture to become healthy and productive members of our society".&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt; Thus, they called their paper "Catholics Can Support the RH Bill in Good Conscience".&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

In response, the Ateneo administration announced its unity with Catholic teaching and that it had "serious objections to the present bill".&lt;ref name=Ateneoadmin /&gt;

Proponents such as Lagman also stressed that official Catholic teaching itself, expressed in the Encyclical ''Humanae Vitae'' issued only forty years ago in 1964, is not infallible.&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt; He said that the Papal Commission on Birth Control, which included ranking prelates and theologians, recommended that the Church change its teaching on contraception as it concluded that “the regulation of conception appears necessary for many couples who wish to achieve a responsible, open and reasonable parenthood in today’s circumstances”. The editorial of the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'', moreover, stated that Catholic teaching is "only" a religious teaching and should not be imposed with intolerance on a secular state.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Opponents argue that misery is not the result of the church which they say is the largest charitable organization in the world, but of a breakdown in moral sense that gives order to society, nor does misery come from parents who bring up children in faithfulness, discipline, love and respect for life, but from those who strip human beings of moral dignity and responsibility, by treating them as mere machines, which they believe contraception does.&lt;ref name=ratzinger /&gt;

=== Health reasons ===

Stating that contraception is a lie and "against the beginning of new life", the [[Philippine Medical Association]] also stressed that the "health risks of contraception to women are considerable; the list of side effects is long, and includes high blood pressure, strokes, increased incidence of some forms of cancer".&lt;ref name="pmapp" /&gt;
	 	
[[File:Flag of WHO.svg|thumb|right|170px|While the [[World Health Organization]] acknowledges the possible negative side effects of the pill, it still defines it as an [[essential medicine]].]]

Proponents such as E. Ansioco of Democratic Socialist Women of the Philippines argued that "The World Health Organization (WHO) includes contraceptives in its Model Lists of Essential Drugs" and thus are safe medicines.&lt;ref name=Angsioco2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=essentialmed2010 /&gt; "Medical and scientific evidence," says the main proponent, "shows that all the possible medical risks connected with contraceptives are infinitely lower than the risks of an actual pregnancy and everyday activities...The risk of dying within a year of using pills is 1 in 200,000. The risk of dying from a vasectomy is 1 in 1 million and the risk of dying from using an IUD is 1 in 10 million...But the risk of dying from a pregnancy is 1 in 10,000."&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt;

=== HIV/AIDS ===

The RH bill provides for "prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS and other, STIs/STDs", especially since the number of HIV cases among the young nearly tripled from 41 in 2007 to 110 in 2008.&lt;ref name=Padilla2010 /&gt; Proponents emphasized that RH will help in stemming the AIDS epidemic that is worsening in the Philippines. Lagman explained that "Globally, the new number of reported cases of HIV infections and deaths has dropped by nearly 20 percent. It is therefore both ironic and tragic that the Philippines’ trajectory is towards the other direction. Our country’s HIV/AIDS statistics have increased by 30 percent!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edcellagman.com.ph/speeches/house/271-world-aids-celebration.html |title=World AIDS Celebration |publisher=Edcellagman.com.ph |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary among the means is distribution of condoms. The proponents applauded government efforts last February 2010 when it distributed condoms in some areas of Manila.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== Opinion polls and TV debates ==

Proponents refer to many surveys conducted by two prominent locally based organizations (SWS and Pulse Asia) which show majority support for the bill. A survey conducted in 2008 by the [[Social Weather Stations]], commissioned by the Forum for Family Planning and Development (FFPD), a non-government advocacy group, showed that 68 percent of Filipinos agree that there should be a law requiring government to distribute legal contraceptives.&lt;ref name=Sisante2008 /&gt; SWS President and RH Bill proponent, ''Mahar Mangahas'' reported that the "survey found 71 percent in favor [of the RH Bill], 21 percent undecided, and a mere 8 percent opposed. Among those who originally knew of the bill, the score is 84 percent in favor, and 6 percent opposed. Among those who learned of the bill for the first time because of the survey, the score is 59 percent in favor, versus 11 percent opposed.&lt;ref name=sws2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sisante2008 /&gt; Pulse Asia reported that in an October 2008 survey "most Filipinos are aware of the reproductive health bill pending at the House of Representatives (68%) and are in favor of the bill (63%)".&lt;ref name=pulseasia2008 /&gt; In December 2010, Pulse Asia announced based on the results of an October 2010 survey, 69% of the Filipinos are in favor of the bill.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

President of Prolife Philippines, [[Lito Atienza]], said that the surveys conducted by SWS and Pulse Asia were misleading, because the participants were not fully informed of the bill, were merely aware of it, and informed that it was about health and "modern methods". Instead he referred to the Filipino Family survey of December 2009 conducted by the HB&amp;A International (an affiliate of [[Louis Harris &amp; Associates]]) together with the personnel of Asia Research Organization (the Philippine affiliate of [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup International]]). The survey concluded that 92% of people in metropolitan Manila rejected the bill, "85 percent are not aware that once passed the RH bill would allow teenagers to secure 'abortifacient devices and substances' without their parents’ knowledge and consent....90 percent do not agree that Congress should appropriate P2 billion to the detriment of other essential medicines for free children’s vaccinations, treatment of dreaded diseases and other more important health and medical concerns."&lt;ref name=standard2010 /&gt; Mangahas acknowledged that the SWS surveys did not include the penalties.&lt;ref name=compromise /&gt;

A TV Debate was also hosted by [[ABS-CBN Network|ABS-CBN]] last May 2011. Leaders of both sides, including Rep. Lagman and Rep. Golez were present. According to the ABS-CBN news which reported on the results: "In the SMS poll, 69.58% of votes cast reject the RH bill while 30.42% support it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malig |first=Jojo |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/-depth/05/08/11/philippines-still-divided-reproductive-health-bill |title=Philippines still divided on reproductive health bill &amp;#124; ABS-CBN News &amp;#124; Latest Philippine Headlines, Breaking News, Video, Analysis, Features |publisher=ABS-CBN News |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the separate online poll held on the Harapan microsite that livestreamed the debate, majority voted against the bill at the very end of the debate.{{Dubious|date=August 2012}}

On TV5's Debate ''Hamon sa Pagbabago'' on August 21, 2011, the studio audience voted 100% against the bill, while 58.7% of the viewers voted against the RH Bill via text messaging, versus 41.3% in favor.&lt;ref&gt;TV5 Debate, Hamon sa Pagbabago, 21 August 2011, hosted by Ricardo "Dong" Puno and Luchi Cruz-Valdez.&lt;/ref&gt;

The online poll conducted by the ''[[Philippine Star]]'' published on May 18, 2011, showed that 56% were against the RH Bill, while 44% were in favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/article.aspx?publicationsubcategoryid=522&amp;articleid=687349 |title=Philstar poll on RH Bill » Nation » News &amp;#124; Philippine News |publisher=philstar.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rallies ==

Beginning in late 2010, there were rallies for and against the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/probinsiya/669859/2-dakma-sa-p1m-botya|title=2 dakma sa P.1M botya|first=Ni Boy|last=Cruz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- Uploaded by noli --&gt; by |url=http://www.remate.ph/2011/03/santo-papa-umapela-sa-mga-pinoy-na-ipagtanggol-ang-buhay/ |title=Santo Papa umapela sa mga Pinoy na ipagtanggol ang buhay &amp;#124; Remate |publisher=Remate.ph |date=26 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/bacolod/local-news/20000-join-rally-vs-rh-bill |title=20,000 join rally vs RH bill |publisher=Sun.Star |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=656684 |title=Thousands join anti-RH Bill rally – The Freeman » The Freeman Sections » Cebu News |work=The Philippine Star |date=12 February 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20110328-328023/7-Bataan-%20%20barangays-follow-Ayala-Alabang-pass-own-RH-laws |title=7 Bataan barangays follow Ayala Alabang, pass own RH laws – INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012005912/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20110328-328023/7-Bataan-%20%20barangays-follow-Ayala-Alabang-pass-own-RH-laws# |archive-date=2012-10-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inquirer1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20110313-325287/Thousands-in-Laguna-Quezon-Leyte-march-vs-RH-bill |title=Thousands in Laguna, Quezon, Leyte march vs RH bill – INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iloilonewstoday.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1002:we-need-to-debate-on-rh-bill-says-garin&amp;catid=98:local-news |title=We need to debate on RH Bill, says Garin &amp;#124; The News Today |publisher=Iloilonewstoday.com |date=31 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/02/16/11/rh-bill-activists-hold-rally-house-oks-rh-budget |title=RH bill activists hold rally; House OKs RH budget &amp;#124; ABS-CBN News &amp;#124; Latest Philippine Headlines, Breaking News, Video, Analysis, Features |publisher=ABS-CBN News |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/110157/1000-women-march-to-mendiola-for-reproductive-health-bill |title=1,000 women march to Mendiola for Reproductive Health bill &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-12-13 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsinfo.inquirer.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/103857/no-delay-but-rh-bill-won%E2%80%99t-be-passed-this-year%E2%80%94enrile |title=No delay but RH bill won’t be passed this year—Enrile &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-12-02 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Penalties ==

There is mandatory sexuality education starting grade 5, and "malicious disinformation" is penalized.&lt;ref name="bills" /&gt; All health care service providers which provide reproductive health services, including faith-based hospital administrators, may be imprisoned or fined if they refuse to provide family planning services such as [[tubal ligation]] and [[vasectomy]]. The same may happen to employers who do not provide free services to employees.&lt;ref name="bills" /&gt; Imprisonment ranges from one to six months or a fine ranging from ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) to fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00).&lt;ref name="bills" /&gt; Former Finance Secretary [[Roberto de Ocampo]] stated that these punitive provisions "are tantamount to an affront to civil liberties and smack of religious persecution".&lt;ref name=ocampo /&gt;

Defending the bill, [[Felipe Medalla]], former dean of the [[University of the Philippines School of Economics]], said that "although the poor’s access to family planning services can be improved even without the law, the absence of the law makes it easier to block the program".{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== Separation of church and state ==

The head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the [[Philippines]], [[Archbishop]] [[Luis Antonio Tagle]] opposes the Reproductive Health Bill, along with [[abortion]] and [[contraception]]. Because 81% of Filipinos are Catholics, the Catholic Church exerts a strong influence in public and moral life. Its staunch opposition to the bill has drawn the controversy among non-Catholics and Catholics alike who support the bill whereby many invoke the principle of [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name="CAS2" /&gt;

Fr. Joaquin Bernas, S.J, one of the drafters of the [[Philippine Constitution]] and a prominent lawyer and writer, explained that the concept of separation of church and state is directed towards the state, rather than the church, as it is a political concept. Technically it means "non-establishment of religion," as the Constitution states, "No law shall be passed respecting an establishment of religion." It means that the state should be guided by the principle that it should support no specific religion and so government funding should not be allocated for building churches or mosques and not favor any particular religion. It does not prevent the church, parents, supervisors, teachers and other moral educators from expressing their views and educating their wards on the morality of their personal and social actions. The Catholic Church also states that their stand is based on secular reasons and natural law that are both acceptable to non-Catholics as well. Proponents, on the other hand, state that the church should not meddle in matters of the state and should focus on religious matters, not political matters.&lt;ref name="CAS" /&gt;

== Culture war and its implications ==

[[File:UN-millenium-goals.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Millennium Development Goals at the UN]]
The national debate is seen as part of a wider [[culture war]].&lt;ref name=carrol2009 /&gt; Passing it or not passing it of the bill has negative implications depending on the views. Proponents state that the not passing the bill will make the Philippines no longer be a backward state and unable to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goal]]s, especially the points on poverty alleviation and maternal health. It will mean reneging on international commitments and will slow down modernization. Also, the poor will not have free access to family planning support that many have want, and thus will have more children than they can care for and will not have the money to invest in education to break the intergenerational poverty they are trapped in. Proponents also accuse the Catholic Church of holding the Philippines "hostage" and violating the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name="quiros" /&gt; They argue that a decreased population growth will lead to improved [[quality of life]] and economic development.

== Financials ==

Department of Health is proposing 13.7 billion pesos to be fund the RH Bill if it is passed in 2012, according to Senator [[Pia Cayetano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/70387/%E2%80%98doh-proposed-nearly-p14-billion-to-fund-rh-bill-in-2012%E2%80%99 |title=‘DOH proposed nearly P14 billion to fund RH bill in 2012’ &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-10-04 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filipinos for Life, an anti-abortion organization, claimed that the bill was funded by foreign population control groups, a claim that Rep. [[Edcel Lagman]] denied as "an old yarn which is destitute of factual basis", saying that the lobby opposing the bill was the one which was backed by the "wealthy Catholic hierarchy with the aid of dozens of lay organizations”.&lt;ref name="interaksyon.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dalangin |first=Lira |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/18863/no-foreign-funding-for-rh-lobby----lagman |title=No foreign funding for RH lobby - Lagman |publisher=InterAksyon.com |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young Nine Legislators (Y9L)—including Aliah Dimaporo, [[Lucy Torres-Gomez]], Karlo Alexei Nograles—said that “The proposed P3 billion appropriation for the RH bill, if put towards education, can help secure the future of young Filipinos. That amount can build 4,644 new classrooms…or it can subsidize the college education of 300,000 scholars—a chance for underprivileged student achievers to earn their diploma”.&lt;ref name="tdz" /&gt;

Lagman on the other hand said that both these priorities are important but with a burgeoning population the budget will become even tighter, thus population growth is a major issue.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== International reactions ==

=== European Union ===

[[European Union]] Ambassador to the Philippines Alistair MacDonald said "We have all seen the figures on illegal abortion a year in the Philippines and I very much hope that both Houses of Congress will take these issues into account in producing a reproductive health legislation which will really help people make their own choices and to provide for their families".&lt;ref name=EU /&gt;

MacDonald said that lack of effective access to reproductive health services in the Philippines was "antithetical" to the country’s struggle against poverty and "It seems to me extremely unlikely that the Philippines will be able to meet its commitment under the MDGs under the present policy".&lt;ref name=EU /&gt; MacDonald noted that the [[total fertility rate]] for the richest quintile of the population is 2.0, while the total fertility rate of the poorest quintile is 5.9. The total fertility rate for women with a college education is 2.3, about half that of women with only elementary education (4.5). He mentioned that the lack of access to RH services is anti-women, citing the slow decline in the maternal mortality ratio in the Philippines. He also said surveys suggest that the total wanted fertility rate for the Philippines is 2.4 children, or below the actual TFR of 3.3 children.&lt;ref name=EU /&gt;

== Status ==

=== Legislature ===
On January 31, 2011, six different bills were consolidated into a single RH Bill which was then unanimously approved for plenary debate by the House Committee on Population and Family Relations. On February 7, 2011, the bill was scheduled to go before the House Appropriations Committee. On February 16, 2011, the bill was endorsed by the House Appropriations Committee with amendment and referred back to the Population Committee for finalizing the language.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== President and Cabinet ===
&lt;!-- [[File:Noynoy Aquino.jpg|thumb|right|150px|President [[Noynoy Aquino]] before the elections: "I will not promote it". He is strongly pushing for the passage of the RH Bill.{{Weasel-inline|date=August 2012}}]] --&gt;
President [[Noynoy Aquino]] during the presidential campaign said that it confounds him why he is always associated with the RH Bill and reiterated that he is neither an author nor a co-author and did not sign the committee report regarding the bill. He said that "he will fully support the crafting of a firm policy that will address the serious problem on population"&lt;ref name=pdivarious /&gt; At the same time, Aquino said that "artificial contraception was a matter of choice and conscience and that health professionals who fool people into using artificial contraceptives should be penalized. As a Catholic, Aquino said he himself was not promoting artificial contraception but believes that the government should be able to provide it to Filipinos who ask for it". Aquino stressed, "I’m a Catholic, I'm not promoting it. My position is more aptly called responsible parenthood rather than reproductive health."&lt;ref name=tubeza /&gt;

According to [[Rina Jimenez David]] who is pro-RH, during the “Women Deliver Philippines” Conference held September 2010, [[Dinky Soliman]], Aquino's Secretary of Social Welfare and Development, said that "choice and access” constituted the keystone of the Aquino government’s policy, reiterating the administration’s support for the pending reproductive health bills.&lt;ref name=jimenezsept10 /&gt;

On December 2010, the Cabinet and the CBCP agreed to have a joint campaign providing full information on the advantages and risks of contraceptives, natural and artificial family planning and responsible parenthood. They have established a technical working group for this purpose. They also agreed that government will not be an "instrument to enforce or violate the conscience of the people about these issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- Uploaded by remate.tonight --&gt; by |url=http://www.remate.ph/2010/12/cbcp-palace-to-launch-info-drive-on-family-planning/ |title=CBCP, Palace to launch info drive on family planning&amp;#124; Remate |publisher=Remate.ph |date=2010-12-15 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by April 2011 Aquino has given his full support to the entire RH Bill in a speech at the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] and promised to push for its passage even at the "risk of excommunication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mogato |first=Manuel |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/04/17/11/aquino-risks-church-ire-reproductive-health-bill |title=Aquino risks Church ire on reproductive health bill |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compromise and alternatives ===
Senate President [[Juan Ponce Enrile]], Congressman [[Roilo Golez]] and Buhay party-list separately filed bills that seek to restrict abortion and birth control use. These bills have been seen either as a nullification of the RH Bill, its alternative, or as a way of achieving unity among the populace, since the RH Bill proponents have stated their concern in preventing abortion.

Presidential candidate [[Gilbert Teodoro]] or Gibo suggested a cash transfer from the government to individuals wanting access to family planning methods, whether natural or artificial. The individuals can then make use of the cash they receive to purchase birth control devices they may choose, thus guaranteeing freedom of choice.&lt;ref name="villegas0410" /&gt;

The Loyola School of Theology and the John J. Carroll Institute on State and Church Issues issued nine talking points on the RH Bill. Among other points, they proposed a study on the meaning of conception in the Constitution, and if it means fertilization, abortifacients "are to be banned even now and regardless of whether the RH Bill is passed". They also proposed "parallel programs for providing information and training, one for Natural Family Planning (NFP) and another for artificial methods of family planning".&lt;ref name="LST" /&gt; Columnist Jose Sison of the ''[[Philippine Star]]'' criticized that "a Catholic School of theology has actually proposed in public, the use of tax payers’ money to train Filipinos to employ methods that are objectively and intrinsically evil" and cites "empirical evidence and scientific proofs confirming the harmful and evil effects of contraceptives to individuals and to society."&lt;ref name=Sagalosison /&gt;

=== Other events 2010–2012 ===
In September 2010, Aquino, during this visit to the United States, reiterated his stand that he is in favor of responsible parenthood and respects the decision of each couple as to the number of children they want, and if they need the government support for contraception, the government will provide it. This statement has created a furor as Catholic church leaders say that Aquino has sold out the Filipino soul in exchange for some "measly" aid from the United States. The President of the Catholic Bishops Conference said that there could be an excommunication of the President if he continues his stance. Pro-RH Bill snators encouraged the President to be steadfast to do his duties towards the state. The President's spokesperson [[Edwin Lacierda]] explained that the President "has not changed his stand" and is reaching out to the prelates and said that he has not made any decision in support of the Reproductive Health Bill as he was still studying the document. Lacierda said that the Executive Branch "is not involved in the passage of the RH bill, saying the measure's fate rests solely on the legislative branch."

[[Filipino Freethinkers]], an association of agnostics, atheists, progressives, etc., very active in the fight in favor of the RH bill, stepped up the pressure, creating more controversy that fired up renewed interest in the bill on both sides. On September 30, 2010, one of the freethinkers, Carlos Celdran staged a protest action against the Catholic Church, holding a sign which read "DAMASO," a reference to the villainous, corrupt clergyman [[Father Dámaso]] of the novel ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'' by Filipino revolutionary writer [[Jose Rizal]], and shouting "stop getting involved in politics!" A fan page, Free Carlos Celdran was created in [[Facebook]], which generated 23,808 fans in 24 hours. Francisco Montalvan of the ''Inquirer'' said that in the end the Damasos are the scheming, corrupt and deceptive people, implying that the "pro-death advocates" are these, while the Cardinal Rosales who started a nationwide fund for the poor is very far from Damaso. Meanwhile, the [[Imam]] Council of the Philippines, the top leaders of the Moslem population which at 4.5 million constitutes 5% of the Philippine population, declared that they are against contraceptives since using them "underestimates God" and "makes one lose morality in the process."

During the first public hearing on 24 Nov, the chair of the Committee on Population handling the bill said that there is no instruction from the Speaker of the House to expedite the bill. Upon the call of anti-RH congressmen, the Committee Chair decided to refer the bill also to the Committee on Health since the bill is about Reproductive Health. Leader of the pro-RH group, Elizabeth Ansioco, said that the bill is doomed if it is referred to the Committee on Health. Anti-RH Deputy Speaker Congressman Pablo Garcia said the members of the Committee on Health knew of the WHO announcement on the carcinogenicity of combined estrogen-progestogen oral contraceptives.

House Speaker Belmonte said that Congress is not likely to rush the legislation of the bill and will tackle it in plenary early next year. Belmonte said it is better that highly contentious bills be given more attention.

On 3 December, the Senate cut the proposed budget of P 880M for contraceptives down to P 8M for condoms since other contraceptives violated the Constitution's ban on abortifacients, and Senator Tito Sotto III said that his constituents never asked for contraceptives.

On 27 July 2012, the Speaker of the House decided to put to a vote, by August 7, 2012, on whether the debates have to be terminated.  Meanwhile, six co-authors of the bill withdrew support, with the head of the minority group of the house declaring that eight of their group are withdrawing their previous support for the bill.&lt;ref name="philstar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/article.aspx?publicationsubcategoryid=200&amp;articleid=832879 |title=House minority group no longer supports RH bill » Nation » News &amp;#124; Philippine News |publisher=philstar.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Congressional approval and presidential assent ===
At 3 in the morning on December 13, 2012, the House of Representatives voted on second reading in favor of the bill with 113–109 while five representatives abstained. In the upper house, the Senate voted, on December 18, 2012, to pass the bill on second reading with 13–8, while Senators [[Sergio Osmeña, III|Sergio Osmeña III]] and [[Lito Lapid]] were absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/326013/congress-passes-rh-bill |title=Congress passes RH Bill |author1=Cathy C.

On the same day, both houses passed the bill on the third and final reading. Members of the House of Representatives voted 133–79, while seven representatives abstained. The Senate registered 13–8, the same result as the second reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2012/12/17/congress-passes-rh-bill-258805 |title=House, Senate approve reproductive health bill on final reading |date=December 17, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |work=Sun.Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 19, 2012, both versions of the bill were passed to the Bicameral Committee to produce a final version to be signed by the President Aquino. The committee quickly passed the bill in just one session. It was transmitted back to the House of Representatives and the Senate, which both ratified the bill, with the Senate voting 11–5 in favor of ratification, and the House of Representatives voting via [[voice vote]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/326881/rh-bill-passes-bicam |title=RH Bill passes bicam |author=Maila Ager |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=December 19, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/50815/senate-ratifies-bicam-report-on-rh-bill-by-a-vote-of-11-5 |title=Senate, House ratify bicameral panel version of RH Bill |author1=Karl John Reyes |author2=Lira Dalangin Fernandez |publisher=InterAKSYON |work=[[Associated Broadcasting Company|TV5]] |date=December 19, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222043804/http://www.interaksyon.com/article/50815/senate-ratifies-bicam-report-on-rh-bill-by-a-vote-of-11-5 |archivedate=December 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 2012, President Aquino signed the bill into law, codifying the bill as Republic Act No. 10354, otherwise known as the "Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012". News of the signing was announced by House Majority Leader [[Neptali Gonzales II]] on December 28, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/18728-aquino-signs-rh-bill-into-law |title=President Aquino signs RH bill into law |author=Angela Casauay |publisher=Rappler.com |work=Rappler |date=December 28, 2012 |accessdate=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supreme Court challenge and delay of implementation ===
In response to petitions challenging the law's constitutionality, the Supreme Court voted 10-5 on March 19, 2013 to issue a status quo ante order halting the implementation of the law for four months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Oral arguments were set for June 18 but postponed until July 9 after the Supreme Court received additional petitions and interventions.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |title=SC postpones RH law oral arguments

During oral arguments, several justices indicated that the court "does not seem to be the right forum–at least for now." Ir could not settle medical issues, such as whether any contraceptives to be made available were actually abortifacients. Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno said the court might have no choice but to exercise "judicial restraint" on the 15 petitions opposing the law.&lt;ref name=sc-july-9-2013&gt;

On July 16, the justices voted 8-7 to extend the status quo ante order, which would have expired the next day "until further orders effective immediately."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Supreme Court extends order stopping RH law|date = July 16, 2013|url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/317652/news/nation/supreme-court-extends-order-stopping-rh-law|accessdate = August 18, 2013|work = GMA News Online|author=Mark Merueñas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 8, 2014, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law. The justices, however, struck down eight provisions of the law partially or in full.&lt;ref name="Rappler1" /&gt;

In 2015, the Supreme Court's issued a temporary restraining order on certain provisions of the law, forbidding the distribution of contraceptive implants.&lt;ref name="ap-2017-01-11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/philippines-intensify-drive-offering-free-contraceptives-081710742.html|title=Philippines to offer free contraceptives to 6 million women|author=[[Associated Press]]|website=yahoo.com|date=11 January 2017|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding the restraining order on certain methods of contraception, in September 2018, President Duterte decided to ensure, within 2018, free contraception for 6 million women with unmet needs for modern family planning - in 2018, for 2 million women identified as poor, and later for further 4 million women.&lt;ref name="ap-2017-01-11"/&gt;

'''Rhetorical modes''' (also known as '''modes of discourse''') describe the variety, conventions, and purposes of the major kinds of [[language]]-based [[communication]], particularly [[writing]] and [[speaking]]. Four of the most common rhetorical modes and their purpose are [[Narrative mode|narration]], [[description]], [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]], and [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]].{{sfn|Rozakis|2003|p=271}}  The first codification of these rhetorical modes was by Samuel P. Newman in ''A Practical System of Rhetoric'' in 1827.{{sfn|Connors|1981|p=445}} 

==Narration==
{{further|Exposition (narrative)}}
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
The purpose of [[narrative mode|narration]] is to tell a story or narrate an event or series of events. This writing mode frequently uses the tools of descriptive writing. Narration is an especially useful tool for sequencing or putting details and information into some kind of logical order, usually chronological. Working with narration helps us see clear sequences separate from all other mental functions. Examples include:
*[[Anecdote]]s
*[[Autobiography]]
*[[Biography]]
*[[Novel]]s
*[[Oral history]]
*[[Short story]]

==Description==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
The  purpose of description is to re-create, invent, or visually present a person, place, event, or action so that the reader can picture that which is being described. Descriptive writing can be found in the other rhetorical modes.  Examples include:
*[[Personal journal|Journal writing]]
*[[Poetry]]

==Exposition==
Expository writing is a type of [[writing]] where the purpose is to explain, inform, or even describe.&lt;ref name=ball&gt;{{cite web|last=Ball|first=Arnetha F.|title=Expository Writing|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~arnetha/expowrite/info.html|publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be one of the four most common rhetorical modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nordquist|first=Richard|title=Expository Writing|url=http://grammar.about.com/od/e/g/Expository-Writing-term.htm|publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of expository writing is to explain and analyze information by presenting an idea, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion. In [[narrative]] contexts (such as [[history]] and [[fiction]]), [[exposition (narrative)|exposition]] provides background information to teach or entertain. In other [[nonfiction]] contexts (such as [[technical communication]]), the purpose is to teach and inform. Examples include:{{sfn|Rozakis|2003|p=271}}
* Business
**[[Business letter]]s
**[[Report]]s
**[[News release|Press releases]]
* Journalism
**[[How-to|How-to essays, such as recipes and other instructions]]
**[[Article (publishing)|News article]]
* Personal
**[[Personal letter]]s
**[[Will (law)|Wills]]
* Academic and [[technical communication]]
**[[Scientific writing]]
***[[Scientific report]]s
***[[Scientific journal]] articles
**[[Academic writing]]
***[[Term paper]]s
***[[Textbook]]s
***General [[reference work]]s
****[[Encyclopedia|Encyclopedia articles]]
**[[Technical writing]]
***[[User guide]]s
***[[Technical standard]]s

==Argumentation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
The purpose of argumentation (also called ''[[persuasive writing]]'') is to prove the validity of an idea, or point of view, by presenting sound reasoning, discussion, and argument to thoroughly convince the reader. Persuasive writing/Persuasion is a type of argumentation with the additional aim to urge the reader to take some form of action.  Examples include:
*[[Copywriting|Advertising copy]]
*[[review|Critical review]]
*[[Editorial]]s
*[[Job evaluation]]
*[[Job application]] letter
*[[Letter of recommendation]]
*[[Letter to the editor|Letters to the editor]]
*[[Résumé]]s

Another form of persuasive rhetoric is satirical rhetoric, or using humor in order to make a point about some aspect of life or society. Perhaps the most famous example is [[Jonathan Swift]]'s "[[A Modest Proposal]]".

==Fiction-writing modes==
Each [[fiction-writing mode]] has its own purposes and conventions. Agent and author Evan Marshall identifies five fiction-writing modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt| Marshall | 1998 | pp = 143–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and writing-instructor [[Jessica Page Morrell]] lists six delivery modes for fiction-writing: action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt | Morrell | 2006 | p = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Peter Selgin]] refers to ''methods'', including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, and description.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt | Selgin | 2007 | p = 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of '''self-confidence'''  self-assurance in one's personal judgment, ability, [[Power (sociology)|power]], etc. One increases self-confidence from experiences of having mastered particular activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6IyqCNBD6oIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Hewitt,+John+P.+(2009).+Oxford+Handbook+of+Positive+Psychology.+Oxford+University+Press.+pp.+217%E2%80%93224.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKg-Lcoc_QAhVkwVQKHU_LCtYQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology|last=Snyder|first=C. R.|last2=Lopez|first2=Shane J.|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195187243|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a positive&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; belief that in the future one can generally accomplish what one wishes to do. Self-confidence is not the same as [[self-esteem]], which is an evaluation of one’s own worth, whereas self-confidence is more specifically trust in one’s ability to achieve some goal, which one meta-analysis suggested is similar to generalization of [[self-efficacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Judge|first=Timothy A.|last2=Erez|first2=Amir|last3=Bono|first3=Joyce E.|last4=Thoresen|first4=Carl J.|date=2002-09-01|title=Are measures of self-esteem, neuroticism, locus of control, and generalized self-efficacy indicators of a common core construct?|url= |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=English|volume=83|issue=3|pages=693–710|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.3.693|issn=1939-1315}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Maslow]] and many others after him have emphasized the need to distinguish between self-confidence as a generalized personality characteristic, and self-confidence with respect to a specific task, ability or challenge (i.e. self-efficacy).  Self-confidence typically refers to general self-confidence. This is different from self-efficacy, which psychologist [[Albert Bandura]] has defined as a “belief in one’s ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish a task”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social cognitive theory. In M. Conner &amp; P. Norman (Eds.), Predicting health behaviour (2nd ed. rev., pp. 127-169).|last=Luszczynska, A. and Schwarzer, R.|first=|publisher=Buckingham, England: Open University Press.|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore is the term that more accurately refers to specific self-confidence. Psychologists have long noted that a person can possess self-confidence that he or she can complete a specific task (self-efficacy) (e.g. cook a good meal or write a good novel) even though they may lack general self-confidence, or conversely be self-confident though they lack the self-efficacy to achieve a particular task (e.g. write a novel). These two types of self-confidence are, however, correlated with each other, and for this reason can be easily conflated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauer|first=Raymond|date=1964-05-01|title=The obstinate audience: The influence process from the point of view of social communication |url= |journal=American Psychologist|language=English|volume=19|issue=5|pages=319–328|doi=10.1037/h0042851|issn=1935-990X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Ideas about the causes and effects of self-confidence have appeared in English language publications describing characteristics of a sacrilegious attitude toward God,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Some Thoughts Concerning the present Revival of Religion in New-England.|last=Edwards, J., &amp; Wesley, J.|first=|publisher=S. Kneeland and T. Green.|year=1742|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the character of the British empire,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=This Vicissitude of Motion and Rest, Which We Call Life,|last=Freiburg|first=R|publisher=The Spectator|year=1742|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the culture of colonial-era American society&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-sJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Democracy+in+America+Volume+2&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7nfH_1s_QAhVX22MKHbNYA1MQ6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Democracy%20in%20America%20Volume%202&amp;f=false|title=Democracy in America: Volume II|last=Tocqueville|first=Alexis de|date=1899-01-01|publisher=Washington Square Press|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (where it seemed to connote arrogance and be a negative attribute.) 

In 1890, the philosopher [[William James]] in his ''[[The Principles of Psychology|Principles of Psychology]]'' wrote, “Believe what is in the line of your needs, for only by such belief is the need fulled ... Have faith that you can successfully make it, and your feet are nerved to its accomplishment,” expressing how self-confidence could be a virtue. That same year, Dr. Frederick Needham in his presidential address to the opening of the [[The BMJ|British Medical Journal]]’s Section of Psychology praised a progressive new architecture of an asylum accommodation for insane patients as increasing their self-confidence by offering them greater “liberty of action, extended exercise, and occupation, thus generating self-confidence and becoming, not only excellent tests of the sanity of the patient, but operating powerfully in promoting recovery.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Needham|first=Frederick|date=1890-08-09|title=An Address Delivered at the Opening of the Section of Psychology|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=2|issue=1545|pages=325–330|issn=0007-1447|pmc=2207994|pmid=20753102|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.1545.325}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, he seemed to early on suggest that self-confidence may bear a scientific relation to mental health.

With the arrival of [[World War I]], psychologists praised self-confidence as greatly decreasing nervous tension, allaying fear, and ridding the battlefield of terror; they argued that soldiers who cultivated a strong and healthy body would also acquire greater self-confidence while fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bird|first=Charles|date=1917-01-01|title=From Home to the Charge: A Psychological Study of the Soldier|jstor=1413607|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|volume=28|issue=3|pages=315–348|doi=10.2307/1413607}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the [[Temperance movement|Temperance social reform movement]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; of the 1920s, psychologists associated self-confidence in men with remaining at home and taking care of the family when they were not working.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wheeler|first=Mary P.|date=1918-01-01|title=Alcohol and Social Case Work|jstor=1014456|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=77|pages=154–159|doi=10.1177/000271621807700116}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Great Depression]], Philip Eisenberg and Paul Lazerfeld noted how a sudden negative change in one’s circumstances, especially a loss of a job, could lead to decreased self-confidence, but more commonly if the jobless person believes the fault of his unemployment is his.

In 1943, [[Abraham Maslow]] in his paper “A Theory of Human Motivation” argued that an individual only was motivated to acquire self-confidence (one component of “esteem”) after he or she had achieved what they needed for physiological survival, safety, and love and belonging. He claimed that satisfaction of self-esteem led to feelings of self-confidence that, once attained, led to a desire for “[[self-actualization]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maslow|first=A.

Some studies suggest various factors within and beyond an individual's control that affect their self-confidence. Hippel and Trivers propose that people will deceive themselves about their own positive qualities and negative qualities of others so that they can display greater self-confidence than they might otherwise feel, thereby enabling them to advance socially and materially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hippel|first=William von|last2=Trivers|first2=Robert|date=2011-02-01|title=The evolution and psychology of self-deception|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/the-evolution-and-psychology-of-self-deception/B87968EC4A6B4DC93A21C217ABC13E13|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=34|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1017/S0140525X10001354|issn=1469-1825}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have found that new information about an individual’s performance interacts with an individual’s prior self-confidence about their ability to perform. If that particular information is negative feedback, this may interact with a negative affective state (low self-confidence) causing the individual to become demoralized, which in turn induces a self-defeating attitude that increases the likelihood of failure in the future more than if they did not lack self-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cervone|first=Daniel|last2=Kopp|first2=Deborah A.|last3=Schaumann|first3=Linda|last4=Scott|first4=Walter D.|date=1994-09-01|title=Mood, self-efficacy, and performance standards: Lower moods induce higher standards for performance |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=English|volume=67|issue=3|pages=499–512|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.3.499|issn=1939-1315}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright, J.

A meta-analysis of 12 articles found that generally when individuals attribute their success to a stable cause (a matter under their control) they are less likely to be confident about being successful in the future. If an individual attributes their failure to an unstable cause (a factor beyond their control, like a sudden and unexpected storm) they are less likely to be confident about succeeding in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiner, Bernard|first=|year=1985|title=An attributional theory of achievement motivation and emotion|url=|journal=Psychological Review|volume=92 |issue=4|pages=548–573|via=|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.92.4.548}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if an individual believes he/she and/or others failed to achieve a goal (e.g. give up smoking) because of a factor that was beyond their control, he or she is more likely to be more self-confident that he or she can achieve the goal in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eiser|first=J.

=== Variation between different categorical groups ===
Social scientists have found ways in which self-confidence seems to operate differently within various groups in society.

==== Children ====
In children, self-confidence emerges differently than adults. For example, Fenton suggested that only children as a group are more self-confident than other children.&lt;ref name="Fenton 546–556"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fenton|first=Norman|title=The Only Child |journal=The Pedagogical Seminary and Journal of Genetic Psychology|volume=35|issue=4|pages=546–556|doi=10.1080/08856559.1928.10532171|year=1928}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zimmerman claimed that if children are self-confident they can learn they are more likely to sacrifice immediate recreational time for possible rewards in the future. enhancing their self-regulative capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=Barry J.|date=1990-01-01|title=Self-Regulated Learning and Academic Achievement: An Overview |journal=Educational Psychologist|volume=25|issue=1|pages=3–17|doi=10.1207/s15326985ep2501_2|issn=0046-1520}}&lt;/ref&gt; By adolescence, youth that have little contact with friends tend to have low self-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waddell|first=Kathleen J.|date=1984-03-01|title=The self-concept and social adaptation of hyperactive children in adolescence |journal=Journal of Clinical Child Psychology|volume=13|issue=1|pages=50–55|doi=10.1080/15374418409533169|issn=0047-228X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful performance of children in music also increases feelings of self-confidence, increasing motivation for study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clift, S., Hancox, G., Staricoff, R., &amp; Whitmore, C.|first=|year=2008|title=Singing and health: A systematic mapping and review of non-clinical research.|url=|journal=Sidney de Haan Research Centre for Arts and Health: Canterbury Christ Church University.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hallam|first=Susan|date=2010-08-01|title=The power of music: Its impact on the intellectual, social and personal development of children and young people |journal=International Journal of Music Education|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=269–289|doi=10.1177/0255761410370658|issn=0255-7614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Students ====
Many studies focus on students in school. In general, students who perform well have increased confidence which likely in turn encourages students to take greater responsibility to successfully complete tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=Barry J.|last2=Kitsantas|first2=Anastasia|date=2005-10-01|title=Homework practices and academic achievement: The mediating role of self-efficacy and perceived responsibility beliefs |journal=Contemporary Educational Psychology|volume=30|issue=4|pages=397–417|doi=10.1016/j.cedpsych.2005.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students who perform better receive more positive evaluations report and greater self-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pajares|first=Frank|last2=Johnson|first2=Margaret J.|date=1996-04-01|title=Self-efficacy beliefs and the writing performance of entering high school students |journal=Psychology in the Schools|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|pages=163–175|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6807(199604)33:23.0.CO;2-C|issn=1520-6807}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low achieving students report less confidence and high performing students report higher self-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zusho|first=Akane|last2=Pintrich|first2=Paul R.|last3=Coppola|first3=Brian|date=2003-09-01|title=Skill and will: The role of motivation and cognition in the learning of college chemistry |journal=International Journal of Science Education|volume=25|issue=9|pages=1081–1094|doi=10.1080/0950069032000052207|issn=0950-0693}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers can greatly affect the self-confidence of their students depending on how they treat them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7A2LKwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Smith,+E.+R.;+Mackie,+D.+M.+(2007).+Social+Psychology+(Third+ed.).&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB6ZHa9s_QAhXP0RoKHRzOBAUQ6AEIJjAA|title=Social Psychology|last=Smith|first=Eliot R.|last2=Mackie|first2=Diane M.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781841694085|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, Steele and Aronson established that black students perform more poorly on exams (relative to white students) if they must reveal their racial identities before the exam, a phenomenon known as “stereotype threat.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steele, C.

In one study of UCLA students, males (compared to females) and adolescents with more siblings (compared to those with less) were more self-confident. Individuals who were self-confident specifically in the academic domain were more likely to be happy but higher general self-confidence was not correlated with happiness. With greater anxiety, shyness and depression, emotionally vulnerable students feel more lonely due to a lack of general self-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheng |first=Helen |last2=Furnham |first2=Adrian |date=2002-06-01|title=Personality, peer relations, and self-confidence as predictors of happiness and loneliness |journal=Journal of Adolescence|volume=25|issue=3|pages=327–339|doi=10.1006/jado.2002.0475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study of first year college students found men to be much more self-confident than women in athletic and academic activities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopez, F.

==== Men versus women ====
In the aftermath of the first wave of feminism and women’s role in the labor force during the World War, Maslow argued that some women who possessed a more “dominant” personality were more self-confident and therefore would aspire to and achieve more intellectually than those that had a less “dominant” personality—even if they had the same level of intelligence as the “less dominant” women. However, Phillip Eisenberg later found the same dynamic among men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maslow|first=A. H.|title=Dominance, Personality, and Social Behavior in Women |journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=10|issue=1|pages=3–39|doi=10.1080/00224545.1939.9713343|year=1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common finding is that males who have low generalized self-confidence are more easily persuaded than males of high generalized self-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOk8TFBYWHIC&amp;pg=PA222 |title=Documents of Gestalt Psychology|last=Henle|first=Mary|date=1961-01-01|publisher=University of California Press|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkowitz|first=Leonard|last2=Lundy|first2=Richard M.|date=1957-03-01|title=Personality Characteristics Related to Susceptibility to Influence by Peers or Authority Figures |journal=Journal of Personality|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=306–316|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1957.tb01529.x|issn=1467-6494}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janis|first=Irving L|date=1954-06-01|title=Personality Correlates of Susceptibility To Persuasion |journal=Journal of Personality|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=504–518|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1954.tb01870.x|issn=1467-6494}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have found that women who are either high or low in general self-confidence are more likely to be persuaded to change their opinion than women with medium self-confidence. However, when specific high confidence (self-efficacy) is high, generalized confidence plays less of a role in affecting their ability to carry out the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Donald F.|last2=Bauer|first2=Raymond A.|date=1964-01-01|title=Self-Confidence and Persuasibility in Women|jstor=2747017|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=28|issue=3|pages=453–466|doi=10.1086/267266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research finds that females report self-confidence levels in supervising subordinates proportionate to their experience level, while males report being able to supervise subordinates well regardless of experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Instone, D., Major, B., &amp; Bunker, B.

Evidence also has suggested that women who are more self-confident may received high performance evaluations but not be as well liked as men that engage in the same behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler, D., &amp; Geis, F. L.|first=|year=1990|title=Nonverbal affect responses to male and female leaders: Implications for leadership evaluations.|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=58|pages=48–59|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.1.48}}&lt;/ref&gt; However confident women were considered a better job candidates than both men and women who behaved modestly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rudman, L.

Furthermore, women who initially had low self-confidence are likely to experience a larger drop of self-confidence after separation from their children than women with relatively higher self-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seashore, M.

==== Self-confidence in different cultures ====
Some have suggested that self-confidence is more adaptive in cultures where people are not very concerned about maintaining harmonious relationships. But in cultures that value positive feelings and self-confidence  less, maintenance of smooth interpersonal relationships are more important, and therefore self-criticism and a concern to save face is more adaptive. For example, Suh et al. (1998) argue that East Asians are not as concerned as maintaining self-confidence as Americans&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Suh|first1=E.|last2=Diener|first2=E.|last3=Oishi|first3=S.|last4=Triandis|first4=H.

==== Athletes ====
Many sports psychologists have noted the importance of self-confidence in winning athletic competitions. Amongst athletes, gymnasts who tend to talk to themselves in an instructional format tended to be more self-confident than gymnasts that did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mahoney|first=Michael J.|last2=Avener|first2=Marshall|title=Psychology of the elite athlete: An exploratory study|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01173634|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=135–141|doi=10.1007/BF01173634|issn=0147-5916|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have found that self-confidence is also one of the most influential factors in how well an athlete performs in a competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Craft, L.

== Measures ==
One of the earliest measures of self-confidence used a 12-point scale centered on zero, ranging from a minimum score characterizing someone who is  “timid and self-distrustful, Shy, never makes decisions, self effacing” to an upper extreme score representing someone who is “able to make decisions, absolutely confident and sure of his own decisions and opinions.”&lt;ref name="Fenton 546–556"/&gt;

Some have measured self-confidence as a simple construct divided into affective and cognitive components: anxiety as an affective aspect and self-evaluations of proficiency as a cognitive component.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clément|first=Richard|last2=Kruidenier|first2=Bastian G.|date=1983-09-01|title=Orientations in Second Language Acquisition: I. the Effects of Ethnic Ty, Milieu, and Target Language on Their Emergence |journal=Language Learning|language=en|volume=33|issue=3|pages=273–291|doi=10.1111/j.1467-1770.1983.tb00542.x|issn=1467-9922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more context-based Personal Evaluation Inventory (PEI), developed by Shrauger (1995), measures specific self-esteem and self-confidence in different aspects (speaking in public spaces, academic performance, physical appearance, romantic relationships, social interactions, athletic ability, and general self-confidence score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shrauger|first=J.

Others, skeptical about the reliability of such self-report indices, have measured self-confidence by having examiners assess non-verbal cues of subjects, measuring on a scale of 1 to 5 whether the individual
# maintains frequent eye contact or almost completely avoids eye contact,
# engages in little or no fidgeting, or, a lot of fidgeting,
# seldom or frequently uses self-comforting gestures (e.g. stroking hair or chin, arms around self),
# sits up straight facing the experimenter, or, sits hunched over or rigidly without facing the experimenter,
# has a natural facial expression, or, grimaces,
# does not twiddle hands, or, frequently twiddles something in their hand, or,
# uses body and hand gestures to emphasize a point, or, never uses hand or body gestures to emphasize a point or makes inappropriate gestures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Various systemic-level theories and concepts related to self-confidence ==
Various systemic theories exist that are related to self-confidence.

== Wheel of Wellness ==
The Wheel of Wellness was the first theoretical model of Wellness based in [[counseling theory]]. It is a model based on [[Alfred Adler|Adler]]'s individual psychology and cross-disciplinary research on characteristics of healthy people who live longer and with a higher [[quality of life]]. The Wheel of Wellness includes five life tasks that relate to each other: [[spirituality]], self-direction, work and leisure, friendship, and love. There are 15 subtasks of self-direction areas: sense of worth, sense of control, realistic beliefs, emotional awareness and coping, [[problem solving]] and [[creativity]], sense of [[humor]], nutrition, exercise, self-care, [[stress management]], [[gender identity]], and [[cultural identity]]. There are also five second-order factors, the Creative Self, Coping Self, Social Self, Essential Self, and Physical Self, which allow exploration of the meaning of wellness within the total self. In order to achieve a high self-esteem, it is essential to focus on identifying strengths, positive assets, and resources related to each component of the Wellness model and using these strengths to cope with life challenges.&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=Jane|last2=Willise|first2=John|last3=Villalba|first3=Jose|date=1 January 2011|title=Promoting Self-Esteem in Adolescents: The Influence of Wellness Factors|journal=Journal of Counseling and Development|volume=89|pages=28–30|doi=10.1002/j.1556-6678.2011.tb00058.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implicit vs. explicit==
Implicitly measured self-esteem has been found to be weakly correlated with explicitly measured self-esteem.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}{{clarify|reason=how are these things actually measured?|date=September 2018}} This leads some critics{{who|date=September 2018}} to assume that explicit and implicit self-confidence are two completely different types of self-esteem. Therefore, this has drawn the conclusion that one will either have a distinct, unconscious self-esteem OR they will consciously misrepresent how they feel about themselves. Recent studies have shown that implicit self-esteem doesn't particularly tap into the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]], rather that people consciously overreport their levels of self-esteem. Another possibility is that implicit measurement may be assessing a different aspect of conscious self-esteem altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Timko|first=Alix |author2=England, Erica |author3=Herbert, James |author4=Foreman, Evan |title=The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure as a measure of Self-Esteem|journal=The Psychological Record|date=Fall 2010|volume=60|issue=4|pages=679}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inaccurate self-evaluation is commonly observed in healthy populations. In the extreme, large differences between oneʼs [[self-perception]] and oneʼs actual behavior is a hallmark of a number of disorders that have important implications for understanding treatment seeking and compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beer|first=J.|author2=Lombardo M |author3=Bhanji J. |title=Roles of Medial Prefrontal Cortex and Orbitofrontal Cortex in Self-evaluation|journal=[[Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience]]|date=September 2010|volume=22|issue=9|pages=2108–2119|doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9072">In [[psychophysics]], '''sensory threshold''' is the weakest [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] that an organism can detect. Unless otherwise indicated, it is usually defined as the weakest stimulus that can be detected half the time, for example, as indicated by a point on a probability curve.&lt;ref name="Smith2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Christopher U. M.|title=Biology of Sensory Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SRHYqVumK6gC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=11 October 2014|date=20 November 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-69438-1|pages=34–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods have been developed to measure thresholds in any of the senses.

The first systematic studies to determine sensory thresholds were conducted by [[Ernst Heinrich Weber]], a physiologist and pioneer of experimental psychology at the [[Leipzig University]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://users.ipfw.edu/abbott/120/thresholds.html|title=Sensation: Thresholds and Psychophysics|website=users.ipfw.edu|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; His experiments were intended to determine the absolute and difference, or differential, thresholds. Weber was able to define absolute and difference threshold statistically which lead to the establishment of Weber’s Law and the concept of [[Just-noticeable difference|just noticeable difference]] to describe threshold perception of stimuli.

Following Weber’s work, [[Gustav Fechner]], a pioneer of [[psychophysics]], studied the relationship between the physical intensity of a stimulus and the psychologically perceived intensity of the stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swets|first=John A.|date=1961-07-21|title=Is There a Sensory Threshold?|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/134/3473/168|journal=Science|language=en|volume=134|issue=3473|pages=168–177|doi=10.1126/science.134.3473.168|issn=0036-8075|pmid=13774294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing the measured intensity of sound waves with the perceived loudness, Fechner concluded that the intensity of a stimulus changes in proportion to the logarithm of the stimulus intensity. His findings would lead to the creation of the [[decibel]] scale.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Several different sensory thresholds have been defined;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ttktamop.elte.hu/online-tananyagok/physiology_practical/apas03.html|title=Determination of sensory thresholds|website=ttktamop.elte.hu|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Absolute threshold]]:''' the lowest level at which a stimulus can be detected.
*'''Recognition threshold:''' the level at which a stimulus can not only be detected but also recognised.
*'''[[Just noticeable difference|Differential threshold]]:''' the level at which an increase in a detected stimulus can be perceived.
*'''Terminal threshold:''' the level beyond which a stimulus is no longer detected.
'''Measuring and Testing Sensory Thresholds'''

Defining and measuring sensory thresholds requires setting the sensitivity limit such that the perception observations lead to the absolute threshold. The level of sensitivity is usually assumed to be constant in determining the threshold limit. There are three common methods used to determine sensory thresholds:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# '''Method of Limits:''' In the first step, the subject is stimulated by strong, easily detectable stimuli that are decreased stepwise (descending sequence) until he/she cannot detect the stimulus. Then another stimulation sequence is applied called ascending sequence. In this sequence, stimulus intensity increases from subthreshold to easily detectable. Both sequences are repeated several times. This yields several momentary threshold values. In the following step, mean values are calculated for ascending and descending sequences separately. The mean value will be lower for descending sequences. In case of audiometry, the difference of the means in case of ascending vs. descending sequences has a diagnostic importance. In the final step, average of the previously calculated means will result the absolute threshold.
# '''Method of constant stimuli:''' Stimuli of varying intensities are presented in random order to a subject. Intensities involve stimuli which are surely subthreshold and stimuli which are surely supra-threshold. For the creation of the series, the approximate threshold judged by a simpler method (i.e.: by the method of limits). The random sequences are presented to the subject several times. The strength of the stimulus, perceived in more than half of the presentations will be taken as the threshold.
# '''Adaptive method:''' Stimulation starts with a surely supra-threshold stimulus; then further stimuli are given with an intensity decreased in previously-defined steps. The series is stopped when the stimulus strength become subthreshold (this is called the turn phenomena). Then the step is halved and the stimulation is repeated, but now with increasing intensities, until the subject perceives the sound again. This process is repeated several times, until the step size reaches the preset minimal value. With this method, the threshold value can be delineated very accurately. The initial size of the step can be selected depending on the expected accuracy.
In measuring sensory threshold, noise must be accounted for.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohn|first=Theodore E|last2=Lasley|first2=D J|year=1986|title=Visual sensitivity|url=|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=37|pages=495–521|doi=10.1146/annurev.ps.37.020186.002431|issn=0066-4308|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Signal-to-noise ratio|Signal noise]] is defined as the presence of extra, unwanted energy in the observational system which obscures the information of interest. As the measurements come closer to the absolute threshold, the variability of the noise increases causing the threshold to be obscured.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Different types of internal and external noise include excess stimuli, nervous system over- or under-stimulation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classes.kumc.edu/sah/resources/sensory_processing/learning_opportunities/concepts/sp_concepts_main.htm#neuro|title=Sensory Processing - Introduction to Concepts|website=classes.kumc.edu|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conditions that falsely stimulate nerves in the absence of external stimuli.

A universal absolute threshold is difficult to define a standard because of the variability of the measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meddis|first=Ray|last2=Lecluyse|first2=Wendy|year=2011|title=The psychophysics of absolute threshold and signal duration: A probabilistic approach|url=|journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|volume=129|issue=5|pages=3153–3165|doi=10.1121/1.3569712|issn=0001-4966|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While sensation occurs at the physical nerves, there can be reasons why it is not consistent.

Similarly, psychological factors can affect perception of physical sensation.

'''Aviation use'''.  When related to motion in any of the possible six degrees of freedom (6-DoF), the fact that sensory
thresholds exist is why it is essential that aircraft have blind-flying instruments.  Sustained flight in cloud is not possible by `seat-of-the-pants' cues alone since errors build up due to aircraft movements below the pilot's sensory threshold,
ultimately leading to loss of control. 
* In flight simulators with motion platforms, the motion sensory thresholds are utilised in the technique known as `acceleration-onset cueing'.  This is where a motion platform, having made the initial acceleration that is sensed by the simulator crew, the platform is re-set to approximately its neutral position by being moved at a rate below the sensory threshold and is then ready to respond to the next acceleration demanded by the simulator computer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4522">In [[computer sciences]] the '''separation of [[Protection mechanism|protection]] and [[Computer security|security]]''' is a [[computer design|design]] choice. Wulf et al. identified protection as a [[Mechanism (technology)|mechanism]] and security as a [[policy]],&lt;ref name="Wulf74"&gt;Wulf 74 pp.337-345&lt;/ref&gt; therefore making the protection-security distinction a particular case of the [[separation of mechanism and policy]] principle.

== Overview ==
The adoption of this distinction in a [[computer architecture]], usually means that protection is provided as a [[fault tolerance]] mechanism by [[Electronic hardware|hardware]]/[[firmware]] and [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]], whereas the [[operating system]] and [[Process (computing)|applications]] implement their security policies. In this design, security policies rely therefore on the protection mechanisms and on additional [[cryptography]] techniques.

The major hardware approach&lt;ref name="Swift05"&gt;Swift 2005 p.26&lt;/ref&gt; for security or protection is the use of [[hierarchical protection domains]]. Prominent example of this approach is [[Ring (computer security)|ring]] architecture with "[[Ring (computer security)#Supervisor mode|supervisor mode]]" and "user mode").&lt;ref&gt;Intel Corporation 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Such approach adopts a policy already at the lower levels (hardware/firmware/kernel), restricting the rest of the system to rely on it. Therefore, the choice to distinguish between protection and security in the overall architecture design implies rejection of the hierarchical approach in favour of another one, the [[capability-based addressing]].&lt;ref name="Wulf74" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Houdek et al. 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of models with protection and security separation include: [[access matrix]], [[UCLA Data Secure Unix]], [[take-grant]] and [[filter (security)|filter]]. Such separation is not found in models like: [[High watermark (computer security)|high-water mark]], [[Bell–LaPadula model|Bell–LaPadula]] (original and revisited), [[Information flow (information theory)|information flow]], [[strong dependency]] and [[constraints security model|constraints]].&lt;ref&gt;Landwehr 81, pp. 254, 257; there's a table showing which models for computer security separates protection mechanism and security policy on p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21860">[[File:Shear Moment Diagram.svg|thumb|400px|Shear and Bending moment diagram for a simply supported beam with a concentrated load at mid-span.(right)]]

'''Shear and bending moment diagrams''' are analytical tools used in conjunction with [[structural analysis]] to help perform [[structural design]] by determining the value of [[shear force]] and [[bending moment]] at a given point of a [[structural element]] such as a [[beam bending|beam]].  These diagrams can be used to easily determine the type, size, and material of a member in a structure so that a given set of [[structural load|load]]s can be supported without [[structural failure]]. Another application of shear and moment diagrams is that the [[deflection (engineering)|deflection]] of a beam can be easily determined using either the [[Moment-area theorem|moment area method]] or the [[conjugate beam method]].

==Convention==
Although these conventions are relative and any convention can be used if stated explicitly, practicing engineers have adopted a standard convention used in design practices.

===Normal convention===
The normal convention used in most engineering applications is to label a positive shear force one that spins an element clockwise (up on the left, and down on the right). Likewise the normal convention for a positive bending moment is to warp the element in a "u" shape manner (Clockwise on the left, and counterclockwise on the right). Another way to remember this is if the moment is bending the beam into a "smile" then the moment is positive, with compression at the top of the beam and tension on the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|vauthors =Livermore C, Schmidt H, Williams J, Socrate S|title=2.001 Mechanics &amp; Materials I, Fall 2006.|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-001-mechanics-materials-i-fall-2006|publisher=MIT OpenCourseWare: Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=25 October 2013|location=Lecture 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Shear and Moment Convention.jpg|frame|Normal positive shear force convention (left) and normal bending moment convention (right).]] This convention was selected to simplify the analysis of beams. Since a horizontal member is usually analyzed from left to right and positive in the vertical direction is normally taken to be up, the positive shear convention was chosen to be up from the left, and to make all drawings consistent down from the right. The positive bending convention was chosen such that a positive shear force would tend to create a positive moment.

===Alternative drawing convention===
In [[structural engineer]]ing and in particular [[concrete]] design the positive moment is drawn on the [[Tension (physics)|tension]] side of the member. This convention puts the positive moment below the beam described above. A convention of placing moment diagram on the tension side allows for frames to be dealt with more easily and clearly. Additionally placing the moment on the tension side of the member shows the general shape of the deformation and indicates on which side of a concrete member [[rebar]] should be placed, as concrete is weak in tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moment Diagram Sign Convention Poll|url=http://eng-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=292028|publisher=[[Eng-Tips Forum]]|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calculating shear force and bending moment ==
{{multiple image

}}
With the loading diagram drawn the next step is to find the value of the shear force and moment at any given point along the element. For a horizontal beam one way to perform this is at any point to "chop off" the right end of the beam.

The example below includes a point load, a distributed load, and an applied moment. The supports include both hinged supports and a fixed end support. The first drawing shows the beam with the applied forces and displacement constraints. The second drawing is the loading diagram with the reaction values given without the calculations shown or what most people call a [[free body diagram]]. The third drawing is the [[shear force]] diagram and the fourth drawing is the [[bending moment]] diagram. For the bending moment diagram the normal sign convention was used. Below the moment diagram are the stepwise functions for the shear force and bending moment with the functions expanded to show the effects of each load on the shear and bending functions.

The example is illustrated using [[United States customary units]]. Point loads are expressed in [[Kip (unit)|kip]]s (1 kip = 1000&amp;nbsp;lbf = 4.45&amp;nbsp;kN), distributed loads are expressed in k/ft (1 k/ft = 1 kip/ft = 14.6&amp;nbsp;kN/m), moments are expressed in ft-k (1&amp;nbsp;ft-k = 1&amp;nbsp;ft-kip = 1.356 kNm), and lengths are in ft (1&amp;nbsp;ft = 0.3048 m).

=== Step 1: Compute the reaction forces and moments ===
{{multiple image

| caption1 = Free-body diagram of whole beam
}}

The first step obtaining the bending moment and shear force equations is to determine the reaction forces. This is done using a free body diagram of the entire beam.

The beam has three reaction forces, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; at the two supports and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; at the clamped end.  The clamped end also has a reaction couple ''M''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.  These four quantities have to be determined using two equations, the balance of forces in the beam and the balance of moments in the beam.  Four unknowns cannot be found given two independent equations in these unknown variables and hence the beam is [[statically indeterminate]].  One way of solving this problem is to use the principle of [[linear superposition]] and break the problem up into the superposition of a number of statically determinate problems.  The extra boundary conditions at the supports have to be incorporated into the superposed solution so that the deformation of the entire beam is [[compatibility (mechanics)|compatible]].

From the free-body diagram of the entire beam we have the two balance equations
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sum F = 0 ~,~~ \sum M_{A} = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Summing the forces, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  -10 - (1)(15) + R_a + R_b + R_c = 0  
 &lt;/math&gt;
and summing the moments around the free end (A) we have
:&lt;math&gt;
(R_a)(10) + (R_b)(25) + (R_c)(50) - (1)(15)(17.5) -50 + M_c= 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
We can solve these equations for ''R''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; :
:&lt;math&gt;
   R_b = 37.5 - 1.6 R_a + 0.04 M_c
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
  R_c = -12.5 + 0.6 R_a - 0.04 M_c\,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
If we sum moments about the first support from the left of the beam we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  (10)(10) - (1)(15)(7.5) + (R_b)(15) + (R_c)(40) - 50 + M_c = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
If we plug in the expressions for ''R''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; we get the trivial identity ''0 = 0'' which indicates that this equation is not independent of the previous two.  Similarly, if we take moments around the second support, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  (10)(25) - (R_a)(15) + (1)(15)(7.5) + (R_c)(25) - 50 + M_c = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Once again we find that this equation is not independent of the first two equations.  We could also try to compute moments around the clamped end of the beam to get
:&lt;math&gt;
  (10)(50) - (R_a)(40) - (R_b)(25) + (1)(15)(32.5) - 50 + M_c = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
This equation also turns out not to be linearly independent from the other two equations.  Therefore, the beam is statically indeterminate and we will have to find the bending moments in segments of the beam as functions of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Step 2: Break beam into segments ===
After the reaction forces are found, you then break the beam into pieces. The location and number of external forces on the member determine the number and location of these pieces. The first piece always starts from one end and ends anywhere before the first external force.

=== Step 3: Compute shear forces and moments - first piece ===
{{multiple image
| align     = right
| direction = vertical
| width = 300
| image1 = Section One.PNG
| caption1 = Free-body diagram of segment 1
}}
Let ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; be the shear force and bending moment respectively in a cross-section of the first beam segment. As the section of the beam moves towards the point of application of the external force the magnitudes of the shear force and moment may change. This makes the shear force and bending moment a function of the position of cross-section (in this example ''x'').

By summing the forces along this segment and summing the moments, the equations for the shear force and bending moment are obtained.  These equations are:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sum F = -10 - V_1 = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sum M_A = -V_1 x  + M_1 = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   V_1 = -10 \quad \text{and} \quad M_1 = -10x \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Step 4: Compute shear forces and moments - second piece ===
{{multiple image
| align     = right
| direction = vertical
| width = 300
| image1 = Section Two.PNG
| caption1 = Free-body diagram of segment 2
}}

Taking the second segment, ending anywhere before the second internal force, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sum F = -10 + R_a - (1)(x-10) - V_2 = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sum M_A = R_a (10) - (1)(x-10)\frac{(x + 10)}{2} - V_2 x + M_2 = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   V_2 = R_a -x \quad \text{and} \quad 
   M_2 = -50 + R_a (x-10) - \frac{x^2}{2} \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Notice that because the shear force is in terms of x, the moment equation is squared. This is due to the fact that the moment is the integral of the shear force. The tricky part of this moment is the distributed force. Since the force changes with the length of the segment, the force will be multiplied by the distance after 10&amp;nbsp;ft. i.e. (x-10) the moment location is defined in the middle of the distributed force, which is also changing. This is where (x+10)/2 is derived from.

Alternatively, we can take moments about the cross-section to get
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sum M_A = 10x - R_a (x-10) + (1)(x-10)\frac{(x- 10)}{2} + M_2 = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Again, in this case,
:&lt;math&gt;
   M_2 = -50 + R_a(x-10) - \frac{x^2}{2} \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Step 5: Compute shear forces and moments - third piece ===
{{multiple image
| align     = right
| direction = vertical
| width = 300
| image1 = Section Three.PNG
| caption1 = Free-body diagram of segment 3
}}

Taking the third segment, and summing forces, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   -10 + R_a + R_b - (1)(15) - V_3 = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
and summing moments about the cross-section, we get
:&lt;math&gt;
   (10)(x) - R_a(x-10) - R_b(x-25) + (1)(15)(x-17.5) + M_3  = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, 
:&lt;math&gt;
   V_3 = 25 - R_a - R_b = R_c
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
   M_3 = 262.5 + R_a (x-10) + R_b (x-25)  - 25 x 
       = -675 + R_a (30  - 0.6 x) - M_c (1 - 0.04 x) + 12.5 x\,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Notice that the distributed force can now be considered one force of 15 kips acting in the middle of where it is positioned.

=== Step 6: Compute shear forces and moments - fourth piece ===
{{multiple image
| align     = right
| direction = vertical
| width = 300
| image1 = Section Four.PNG
| caption1 = Free-body diagram of segment 4
}}
Taking the fourth and final segment, a balance of forces gives
:&lt;math&gt;
  -10 + R_a + R_b - (1)(15) - V_4 = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
and a balance of moments around the cross-section leads to
:&lt;math&gt;
 (10)(x) - R_a(x-10) - R_b(x-25) + (1)(15)(x-17.5) - 50 + M_4 = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Solving for ''V''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   V_4 = 25 - R_a - R_b = R_c
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
   M_4 = 312.5 + R_a (x-10) + R_b (x-25) - 25 x = -625 + R_a(30 - 0.6x) + M_c(0.04x -1) + 12.5x\,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
By plotting each of these equations on their intended intervals, you get the bending moment and shear force diagrams for this beam.  In particular, at the clamped end of the beam, ''x'' = 50 and we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   M_4 = M_c = -937.5 + 40 R_a + 25 R_b \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Step 7: Compute deflections of the four segments ===
We now use the [[Euler-Bernoulli beam theory]] to compute the deflections of the four segments.  The [[differential equation]] that relates the beam deflection (''w'') to the bending moment (''M'') is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \frac{d^2 w}{dx^2} = - \frac{M}{EI}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''E'' is the [[Young's modulus]] and ''I'' is the [[area moment of inertia]] of the beam cross-section.

Substituting the expressions for ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; into the beam equation and solving for the deflection gives us
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
     w_1 &amp; = \frac{5}{3EI}\,x^3 + C_1 + C_2\,x \\
     w_2 &amp; = \frac{1}{24EI}\,x^2\,\left[x^2 + 600 - 4 R_a(x-30)\right] + C_3 + C_4\,x \\
     w_3 &amp; = \frac{1}{100EI}\left[\frac{x^3}{3}(-625 + 30 R_a - 2 M_c) - 50 x^2(-675 + 30 R_a - M_c)\right] + C_5 + C_6\,x \\
     w_4 &amp; = \frac{1}{100EI}\left[\frac{x^3}{3}(-625 + 30 R_a - 2 M_c) - 50 x^2(-625 + 30 R_a - M_c)\right] + C_7 + C_8\,x 
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Step 8: Apply boundary conditions ===
Now we will apply displacement boundary conditions for the four segments to determine the integration constants.

For the fourth segment of the beam, we consider the boundary conditions at the clamped end where ''w''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = d''w''/d''x'' = 0 at ''x'' = 50.  Solving for ''C''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; gives
:&lt;math&gt;
   C_7 = -\frac{1250}{3EI}(-625 + M_c + 30 R_a)  \quad \text{and} \quad
   C_8 = \frac{125}{EI}(-125 + 6 R_a) \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, we can express ''w''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;
   w_4 = -\frac{1}{300EI}(x-50)^2\left[-5(6R_a - 125)(x-50) +2M_c(x+25)\right] \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Now, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at ''x'' = 37.5 (the point of application of the external couple).  Also, the slopes of the deflection curves at this point are the same, i.e., ''dw''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/''dx'' = ''dw''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/''dx''.  Using these boundary conditions and solving for ''C''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, we get
:&lt;math&gt;
   C_5 = -\frac{625}{12EI}(-5675 + 8 M_c + 240 R_a) \quad \text{and} \quad
   C_6 = \frac{250}{EI}\left(3R_a -70\right) \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Substitution of these constants into the expression for ''w''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gives us
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
   w_3 = \frac{1}{300EI}\Bigl[&amp;30 R_a (-50 + x)^3 - 2 M_c (-50 + x)^2 (25 + x) -  \\
       &amp; 625 (-141875 + x (8400 + (-162 + x) x))\Bigr] \,.
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, at the support between segments 2 and 3 where ''x'' = 25, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''dw''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/''dx'' = ''dw''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''dx''. Using these and solving for ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; gives
:&lt;math&gt;
   C_3 = -\frac{3125}{24EI}(-1645 + 4 M_c + 64 R_a) \quad \text{and} \quad C_4 = \frac{25}{12EI}\left(-40325 + 6 M_c + 120 R_a\right)\,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
  w_2 = \frac{1}{24EI}\Bigl[ &amp; -3125 (-1645 + 4 M_c + 64 R_a) + \\
   &amp; 50 (-4025 + 6 M_c + 120 R_a) x + 120 (5 + R_a) x^2 - 4 R_a x^3 + x^4\Bigr] \,.
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
At the support between segments 1 and 2, ''x'' = 10 and ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''dw''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''dx'' = ''dw''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''dx''.  These boundary conditions give us
:&lt;math&gt;
  C_1 = -\frac{125}{24EI}(-40145 + 100 M_c + 1632 R_a)  \quad \text{and} \quad
  C_2 = \frac{25}{4EI}(-1315 + 2 M_c + 48 R_a) \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   w_1 = \frac{5}{24EI}\left[1026125 - 39450 x + 8 x^3 + 20 M_c (-125 + 3 x) + 480 R_a (-85 + 3 x)\right] \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Step 9: Solve for ''M''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; ===
Because ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 at ''x'' = 25, we can solve for ''M''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; to get
:&lt;math&gt;
  M_c = 175 - 7.5 R_a \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Also, since ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 at ''x'' = 10, expressing the deflection in terms of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; (after eliminating ''M''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) and solving for ''R''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, gives
:&lt;math&gt;
   R_a = 25.278  \quad \implies \quad M_c = -14.585 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Step 10: Plot bending moment and shear force diagrams ===
{{multiple image
| align     = right
| direction = vertical
| width = 400
| image1 = Sample Loading Diagram.jpg
| caption1 = Free-body diagram
| image2 = Sample Shear Diagram.jpg
| caption2 = Shear force diagram
| image3 = Sample Moment Diagram.jpg
| caption3 = Bending moment diagram
}}
We can now calculate the reactions ''R''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, the bending moments ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and the shear forces ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  These expressions can then be plotted as a function of length for each segment.

=== Relationship between shear force and bending moment ===
It is important to note the relationship between the two diagrams. The moment diagram is a visual representation of the area under the shear force diagram. That is, the moment is the integral of the shear force. If the shear force is constant over an interval, the moment equation will be in terms of x (linear). If the shear force is linear over an interval, the moment equation will be quadratic (parabolic).

Another note on the shear force diagrams is that they show where external force and moments are applied. With no external forces, the piecewise functions should attach and show no discontinuity. The discontinuities on the graphs are the exact magnitude of either the external force or external moments that are applied. For example, at x = 10 on the shear force diagram, there is a gap between the two equations. This gap goes from -10 to 15.3. The length of this gap is 25.3, the exact magnitude of the external force at that point.  At section 3 on the moment diagram, there is a discontinuity of 50. This is from the applied moment of 50 on the structure. The maximum and minimum values on the graphs represent the max forces and moments that this beam will have under these circumstances.

==Relationships between load, shear, and moment diagrams==
Since this method can easily become unnecessarily complicated with relatively simple problems, it can be quite helpful to understand different relations between the loading, shear, and moment diagram. The first of these is the relationship between a distributed load  on the loading diagram and the shear diagram. Since a distributed load varies the shear load according to its magnitude it can be derived that the slope of the shear diagram is equal to the magnitude of the distributed load. The relationship between distributed load and shear force magnitude is:&lt;ref&gt;[http://emweb.unl.edu/negahban/em325/10a-shear-and-bending-moment/Shear%20stress%20in%20beams.htm Emweb.unl.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dQ}{dx} = -q&lt;/math&gt;

Some direct results of this is that a shear diagram will have a point change in magnitude if a point load is applied to a member, and a linearly varying shear magnitude as a result of a constant distributed load.
Similarly it can be shown that the slope of the moment diagram at a given point is equal to the magnitude of the shear diagram at that distance. The relationship between distributed shear force and bending moment is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beer |first=Ferdinand P. |author2=E. Russell Johnston |author3=John T. DeWolf  |title=Mechanics of Materials |pages=322–323 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-298090-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dM}{dx} = Q&lt;/math&gt;

A direct result of this is that at every point the shear diagram crosses zero the moment diagram will have a local maximum or minimum. Also if the shear diagram is zero over a length of the member, the moment diagram will have a constant value over that length. By calculus it can be shown that a point load will lead to a linearly varying moment diagram, and a constant distributed load will lead to a quadratic moment diagram.

==Practical considerations==
In practical applications the entire stepwise function is rarely written out. The only parts of the stepwise function that would be written out are the moment equations in a nonlinear portion of the moment diagram; this occurs whenever a distributed load is applied to the member. For constant portions the value of the shear and/or moment diagram is written right on the diagram, and for linearly varying portions of a member the beginning value, end value, and slope or the portion of the member are all that are required.&lt;ref name = "Hibbeler 146-148"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hibbeler |first=R.C |title=Structural Analysis |publisher=Macmillan |year=1985 |pages=146–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38070">A '''social dilemma''' is a situation in which an individual profits from selfishness unless everyone chooses the selfish alternative, in which case the whole group loses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allison | first1 = S. T. | last2 = Beggan | first2 = J. K. | last3 = Midgley | first3 = E. H. | year = 1996 | title = The quest for "similar instances" and "simultaneous possibilities": Metaphors in social dilemma research | doi =10.1037/0022-3514.71.3.479 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 71 | issue = 3| pages = 479–497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems arise when too many group members choose to pursue individual profit and immediate satisfaction rather than behave in the group’s best long-term interests. Social dilemmas can take many forms and are studied across disciplines such as psychology, economics, and political science. Examples of phenomena that can be explained using social dilemmas include [[resource depletion]], low [[voter turnout]], and [[overpopulation]].

==Types==

===Prisoner's dilemma===

The [[prisoner's dilemma]] is a simple game that serves as the basis for research on social dilemmas.&lt;ref&gt;Van Vugt, M., &amp; Van Lange, P. A. M. (2006). Psychological adaptations for prosocial behavior: The altruism puzzle. In M. Schaller, J. A. Simpson, &amp; D. T. Kenrick (Eds.), Evolution and Social Psychology (pp. 237–261). New York: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The premise of the game is that two partners in crime are imprisoned separately and each are offered leniency if they provide evidence against the other. As seen in the table below, the optimal individual outcome is to testify against the other without being testified against. However, the optimal group outcome is for the two prisoners to cooperate with each other.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! Prisoner B does not confess (''cooperates'') !! Prisoner B confesses (''defects'')

|-
! Prisoner A confesses (''defects'')
| Prisoner A: goes free&lt;br /&gt;Prisoner B: 3 years || Each serves 2 years
|}

===Public goods===

A [[public goods]] dilemma is a situation in which the whole group can benefit if some of the members give something for the common good but individuals benefit from “free riding” if enough others contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allison | first1 = S. T. | last2 = Kerr | first2 = N.L. | year = 1994 | title = Group correspondence biases and the provision of public goods | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 66 | issue = 4| pages = 688–698 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.4.688}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public goods are defined by two characteristics: non-excludability and non-rivalry—meaning that anyone can benefit from them and one person’s use of them does not hinder another person’s use of them. An example is public broadcasting that relies on contributions from viewers. Since no single viewer is essential for providing the service, viewers can reap the benefits of the service without paying anything for it. If not enough people contribute, the service cannot be provided. In economics, the literature around public goods dilemmas refers to the phenomenon as the free rider problem. The economic approach is broadly applicable and can refer to the free-riding that accompanies any sort of public good.&lt;ref&gt;Baumol, William (1952). Welfare Economics and the Theory of the State. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In social psychology, the literature refers to this phenomenon as social loafing. Whereas as free-riding is generally used to describe public goods, social loafing refers specifically to the tendency for people to exert less effort when in a group than when working alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karau | first1 = Steven J. | last2 = Williams | first2 = Kipling D. | year = 1993 | title = Social loafing: A meta-analytic review and theoretical integration | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 65 | issue = 4| pages = 681–706 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.65.4.681 }} The reduction in motivation and effort when individuals work collectively compared with when they work individually or coactively&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replenishing resource management===

A replenishing resource management dilemma is a situation in which group members share a renewable resource that will continue to produce benefits if group members do not over harvest it but in which any single individual profits from harvesting as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, D. A. (1995). An introduction to social dilemmas. In D.A. Schroeder (Ed.), ''Social dilemmas: Perspectives on individuals and groups'' (pp. 1–14).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tragedy of the commons====

The [[tragedy of the commons]] is a type of replenishing resource management dilemma. The dilemma arises when members of a group share a [[common good (economics)|common good]]. A common good is rivalrous and non-excludable, meaning that anyone can use the resource but there is a finite amount of the resource available and it is therefore prone to [[overexploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brechner | first1 = K. C. | year = 1977 | title = An experimental analysis of social traps | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 552–564 | doi=10.1016/0022-1031(77)90054-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Surexploitation morue surpêcheEn.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Atlantic cod]] stocks were severely overexploited in the 1970s and 1980s, leading to their abrupt collapse in 1992.&lt;ref name=Frank&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kenneth T. Frank |author2=Brian Petrie |author3=Jae S. Choi |author4=William C. Leggett |year=2005|title=Trophic Cascades in a Formerly Cod-Dominated Ecosystem|journal=Science|volume=308 |pages=1621–1623|doi=10.1126/science.1113075|pmid=15947186|issue=5728}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The paradigm of the tragedy of the commons first appeared in an 1833 pamphlet by English economist [[William Forster Lloyd]]. According to Lloyd, "If a person puts more cattle into his own field, the amount of the subsistence which they consume is all deducted from that which was at the command, of his original stock; and if, before, there was no more than a sufficiency of pasture, he reaps no benefit from the additional cattle, what is gained in one way being lost in another. But if he puts more cattle on a common, the food which they consume forms a deduction which is shared between all the cattle, as well that of others as his own, in proportion to their number, and only a small part of it is taken from his own cattle".&lt;ref&gt;W F Lloyd - ''Two Lectures on the Checks to Population'' (1833)&lt;/ref&gt;

The template of the tragedy of the commons can be used to understand myriad problems, including various forms of [[resource depletion]]. For example, overfishing in the 1960s and 1970s led to depletion of the previously abundant supply of [[Atlantic Cod]]. By 1992, the population of cod had completely collapsed because fishers had not left enough fish to repopulate the species.&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt;

===Social traps===

[[File:Smoke Above Sintagma.jpg|thumb|left|Pollution in the sky of [[Athens]], [[Greece]].]]

A [[social trap]] occurs when individuals or groups pursue immediate rewards that later prove to have negative or even lethal consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Platt | first1 = J | year = 1973 | title = Social traps | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 28 | issue = 8| pages = 641–651 | doi=10.1037/h0035723}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of dilemma arises when a behavior produces rewards initially but continuing the same behavior produces [[diminishing returns]]. Stimuli that cause social traps are called sliding reinforcers, since they reinforce the behavior in small doses and punish it in large doses.

An example of a social trap is the use of vehicles and the resulting [[air pollution]]. Viewed individually, vehicles are an adaptive technology that have revolutionized transportation and greatly improved quality of life. But their current widespread use causes negative [[externalities]]. In many places air pollution continues unabated because the convenience of driving a car is immediate and the environmental costs are distant and often do not become obvious until much later.

===Perceptual dilemma===

A perceptual dilemma arises during conflict and is a product of outgroup bias. In this dilemma, the parties to the conflict prefer cooperation while simultaneously believing that the other side would take advantage of conciliatory gestures.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, M.D. (1979). Arms races and escalations: some new evidence. In J.D. Singer (Ed.), ''Explaining war: Selected papers from the correlates of war project'' (pp. 24-252). Beverly Hills, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In conflict====
The prevalence of perceptual dilemmas in conflict has led to the development of two distinct schools of thought on the subject. According to [[deterrence theory]], the best strategy to take in conflict is to show signs of strength and willingness to use force if necessary. This approach is intended to dissuade attacks before they happen. Conversely, the conflict spiral view holds that deterrence strategies increase hostilities and defensiveness and that a clear demonstration of peaceful intentions is the most effective way to avoid escalation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tetlock | first1 = P. E. | year = 1983 | title = Policy-makers' images of international conflict | url = | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 67–86 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1983.tb00130.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the deterrence theory in practice is the [[Cold War]] strategy (employed by both the United States and the [[Soviet Union]]) of [[mutually assured destruction]] (MAD). Because both countries had [[second strike capability]], each side knew that the use of nuclear weapons would result in their own destruction. While controversial, MAD succeeded in its primary purpose of preventing nuclear war and kept the Cold War cold.

Conciliatory gestures have also been used to great effect, in keeping with conflict spiral theory. For example, [[Egyptian President]] [[Anwar El Sadat]]'s 1977 visit to [[Israel]] during a prolonged period of hostilities between the two countries was well-received and ultimately contributed in the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]].

==Theories==

===Game theory===
{{see also|Game theory}}

Social dilemmas have attracted a great deal of interest in the social and behavioral sciences. Economists, biologists, psychologists, sociologists, and political scientists alike study behavior in social dilemmas. The most influential theoretical approach is economic game theory (i.e., rational choice theory, expected utility theory). Game theory assumes that individuals are rational actors motivated to maximize their utilities. Utility is often narrowly defined in terms of people's economic self-interest. Game theory thus predicts a non-cooperative outcome in a social dilemma. Although this is a useful starting premise there are many circumstances in which people may deviate from individual rationality, demonstrating the limitations of economic game theory.

===Evolutionary theories===

Biological and evolutionary approaches provide useful complementary insights into decision-making in social dilemmas. According to [[Gene-centered view of evolution|selfish gene]] theory, individuals may pursue a seemingly irrational strategy to cooperate if it benefits the survival of their genes. The concept of [[inclusive fitness]] delineates that cooperating with family members might pay because of shared genetic interests. It might be profitable for a parent to help their off-spring because doing so facilitates the survival of their genes. Reciprocity theories provide a different account of the evolution of cooperation. In repeated social dilemma games between the same individuals, cooperation might emerge because participants can punish a partner for failing to cooperate. This encourages reciprocal cooperation. [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|Reciprocity]] serves as an explanation for why participants cooperate in [[Dyad (sociology)|dyads]], but fails to account for larger groups. Evolutionary theories of indirect reciprocity and costly signaling may be useful to explain large-scale cooperation. When people can selectively choose partners to play games with, it pays to develop a cooperative [[reputation]]. Cooperation communicates kindness and generosity, which combine to make someone an attractive group member.

===Psychological theories===

Psychological models offer additional insights into social dilemmas by questioning the game theory assumption that individuals are confined to their narrow self-interest. [[Interdependence Theory]] suggests that people transform a given pay-off matrix into an effective matrix that is more consistent with their social dilemma preferences. A prisoner’s dilemma with close kin, for example, changes the pay-off matrix into one in which it is rational to be cooperative. Attribution models offer further support for these transformations. Whether individuals approach a social dilemma selfishly or cooperatively might depend upon whether they believe people are naturally greedy or cooperative. Similarly, [[goal-expectation theory]] assumes that people might cooperate under two conditions: They must (1) have a cooperative goal, and (2) expect others to cooperate. Another psychological model, the appropriateness model, questions the game theory assumption that individuals rationally calculate their pay-offs. Instead many people base their decisions on what people around them do and use simple [[heuristics]], like an equality rule, to decide whether or not to cooperate. The logic of appropriateness suggests that people ask themselves the question: "what does a person like me (identity) do (rules/heuristics) in a situation like this (recognition) given this culture (group)?" (Weber ''et al.'', 2004) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weber | first1 = M. | last2 = Kopelman | first2 = S. | last3 = Messick | first3 = D. | year = 2004 | title = A conceptual Review of Decision Making in Social Dilemmas: Applying the Logic of Appropriateness | url = http://psr.sagepub.com/content/8/3/281.refs | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 281–307 | doi = 10.1207/s15327957pspr0803_4 | pmid = 15454350 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121014004950/http://psr.sagepub.com/content/8/3/281.refs | archivedate = 2012-10-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors promoting cooperation in social dilemmas==
Studying the conditions under which people cooperate can shed light on how to resolve social dilemmas. The literature distinguishes between three broad classes of solutions—motivational, strategic, and structural—which vary in whether they see actors as motivated purely by self-interest and in whether they change the rules of the social dilemma game.

===Motivational solutions===
Motivational solutions assume that people have other-regarding preferences. There is a considerable literature on [[social value orientations]] which shows that people have stable preferences for how much they value outcomes for self versus others. Research has concentrated on three social motives: (1) individualism—maximizing own outcomes regardless of others; (2) competition—maximizing own outcomes relative to others; and (3) cooperation—maximizing joint outcomes. The first two orientations are referred to as proself orientations and the third as a prosocial orientation. There is much support for the idea that prosocial and proself individuals behave differently when confronted with a social dilemma in the laboratory as well as the field.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} People with prosocial orientations weigh the moral implications of their decisions more and see cooperation as the most preferable choice in a social dilemma. When there are conditions of scarcity, like a water shortage, prosocials harvest less from a common resource. Similarly prosocials are more concerned about the environmental consequences of, for example, taking the car or public transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Van Vugt |first=M. |last2=Meertens |first2=R. |lastauthoramp=yes |last3=Van Lange |first3=P. |year=1995 |title=Car versus public transportation? The role of social value orientations in a real-life social dilemma |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=358–378 |url=http://www.professormarkvanvugt.com/files/CarVersusPublicTransportation-JournalofAppliedSocialPsychology-1995.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715120238/http://www.professormarkvanvugt.com/files/CarVersusPublicTransportation-JournalofAppliedSocialPsychology-1995.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-15 |doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1995.tb01594.x |citeseerx=10.1.1.612.8158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on the development of social value orientations suggest an influence of factors like family history (prosocials have more sibling sisters), age (older people are more prosocial), culture (more individualists in Western cultures), gender (more women are prosocial), even university course (economics students are less prosocial). However, until we know more about the psychological mechanisms underlying these social value orientations we lack a good basis for interventions.

Another factor that might affect the weight individuals assign to group outcomes is the possibility of [[communication]]. A robust finding in the social dilemma literature is that cooperation increases when people are given a chance to talk to each other. It has been quite a challenge to explain this effect. One motivational reason is that communication reinforces a sense of group identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Orbell |first=John M. |first2=Robyn M. |last2=Dawes |lastauthoramp=yes |first3=Alphons J. C. |last3=van de Kragt |title=Explaining discussion-induced cooperation |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=54 |issue=5 |pages=811–819 |year=1988 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.54.5.811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there may be strategic considerations as well. First, communication gives group members a chance to make promises and explicit commitments about what they will do. It is not clear if many people stick to their promises to cooperate. Similarly, through communication people are able to gather information about what others do. On the other hand, this information might produce ambiguous results; an awareness of other people's willingness to cooperate may cause a temptation to take advantage of them.

===Strategic solutions===
A second category of solutions are primarily strategic. In repeated interactions cooperation might emerge when people adopt a [[Tit for tat]] strategy (TFT). TFT is characterized by first making a cooperative move while the next move mimics the decision of the partner. Thus, if a partner does not cooperate, you copy this move until your partner starts to cooperate. Computer tournaments in which different strategies were pitted against each other showed TFT to be the most successful strategy in social dilemmas. TFT is a common strategy in real-world social dilemmas because it is nice but firm. Consider, for instance, about marriage contracts, rental agreements, and international trade policies that all use TFT-tactics.

However, TFT is quite an unforgiving strategy and in noisy real-world dilemmas a more forgiving strategy has its own advantages. Such a strategy is known as Generous-tit-for-tat (GTFT).&lt;ref name="Nowak &amp; Sigmund, 1992"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nowak |first=M. A. |first2=K. |last2=Sigmund |year=1992 |title=Tit for tat in heterogeneous populations |journal=Nature |volume=355 |issue=6357 |pages=250–253 |doi=10.1038/355250a0 |url=http://www.ped.fas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/publications_nowak/Nature92b.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616192929/http://www.ped.fas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/publications_nowak/Nature92b.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This strategy always reciprocates cooperation with cooperation, and usually replies to defection with defection. However, with some probability GTFT with forgive a defection by the other player and cooperate. In a world of errors in action and perception, such a strategy can be a [[Nash equilibrium]] and evolutionarily stable. The more beneficial cooperation is, the more forgiving GTFT can be while still resisting invasion by defectors.

Even when partners might not meet again it could be strategically wise to cooperate. When people can selectively choose who to interact with it might pay to be seen as a cooperator. Research shows that cooperators create better opportunities for themselves than non-cooperators: They are selectively preferred as collaborative partners, romantic partners, and group leaders. This only occurs however when people’s social dilemma choices are monitored by others. Public acts of altruism and cooperation like charity giving, philanthropy, and bystander intervention are probably manifestations of reputation-based cooperation.

===Structural solutions===
Structural solutions change the rules of the game either through modifying the social dilemma or removing the dilemma altogether. Field research on conservation behaviour has shown that selective incentives in the form of monetary rewards are effective in decreasing domestic water and electricity use.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Furthermore, numerous experimental and case studies show that [[cooperation]] is more likely based on a number of factors, including whether or not individuals have the ability to monitor the situation, to punish or "sanction" defectors, if they are legitimized by external political structures to cooperate and self-organize, can communicate with one another and share information, know one another, have effective arenas for conflict resolution, and are managing social and ecological systems that have well-defined boundaries or are easily monitorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ostrom|first=Elinor|title=Governing the Commons:The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poteete, Janssen, and Ostrom|title=Working Together: Collective Action, the Commons, and Multiple Methods in Practice|year=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet implementation of reward and punishment systems can be problematic for various reasons. First, there are significant costs associated with creating and administering sanction systems. Providing selective rewards and punishments requires support institutions to monitor the activities of both cooperators and non-cooperators, which can be quite expensive to maintain. Second, these systems are themselves [[public goods]] because one can enjoy the benefits of a sanctioning system without contribution to its existence. The police, army, and judicial system will fail to operate unless people are willing to pay taxes to support them. This raises the question if many people want to contribute to these institutions. Experimental research suggests that particularly low trust individuals are willing to invest money in punishment systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Yamagishi |first=T. |year=1986 |title=The Provision of a Sanctioning System as a Public Good |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=110–116 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.51.1.110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A considerable portion of people are quite willing to punish non-cooperators even if they personally do not profit. Some researchers even suggest that altruistic punishment is an evolved mechanism for human cooperation. A third limitation is that punishment and reward systems might undermine people’s voluntary cooperative intention. Some people get a "warm glow" from cooperation and the provision of selective incentives might crowd out their cooperative intention. Similarly the presence of a negative [[negative reinforcement|sanctioning]] system might undermine voluntary cooperation. Some research has found that punishment systems decrease the trust that people have in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mulder |first=L.B. |last2=Van Dijk |first2=E. |last3= De Cremer |first3= D. |last4= Wilke |first4= H.A.M. |year=2006 |title=Undermining trust and cooperation: The paradox of sanctioning systems in social dilemmas|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=147–162 |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2005.03.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has found that ''graduated'' sanctions, where initial punishments have low severity, make allowances for unusual hardships, and allow the violator to reenter the trust of the collective, have been found to support collective resource management and increase trust in the system.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ostrom|first=Elinor|title=Governing the Commons|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poteete|title=Working Together|year=2010|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boundary structural solutions modify the social dilemma structure and such strategies are often very effective. Experimental studies on commons dilemmas show that [[overharvesting]] groups are more willing to appoint a leader to look after the common resource. There is a preference for a democratically elected prototypical [[leader]] with limited power especially when people’s group ties are strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Van Vugt |first=M. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=De Cremer |first2=D. |year=1999 |title=Leadership in social dilemmas: The effects of group identification on collective actions to provide public goods |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=76 |issue=4 |pages=587–599 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.76.4.587|url=https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/654858/JPSP1999_MarkDave_.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;   When ties are weak, groups prefer a stronger leader with a coercive power base. The question remains whether authorities can be trusted in governing social dilemmas and field research shows that legitimacy and fair procedures are extremely important in citizen’s willingness to accept authorities. Other research emphasizes a greater motivation for groups to successfully self-organize, without the need for an external authority base, when they do place a high value on the resources in question but, again, before the resources are severely overharvested. An external "authority" is not presumed to be the solution in these cases, however effective self-organization and collective governance and care for the resource base is.&lt;ref name="Ostrom 2009 419–422"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ostrom|first=Elinor|title=A General Framework for Analyzing Sustainability of Social-Ecological Systems|journal=Science|date=24 July 2009|volume=325|issue=5939|pages=419–422|doi=10.1126/science.1172133|pmid=19628857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another structural solution is reducing group size. Cooperation generally declines when group size increases. In larger groups people often feel less responsible for the common good and believe, rightly or wrongly, that their contribution does not matter. Reducing the scale—for example through dividing a large scale dilemma into smaller more manageable parts—might be an effective tool in raising cooperation. Additional research on governance shows that group size has a curvilinear effect, since at low numbers, governance groups may also not have the person-power to effectively research, manage, and administer the resource system or the governance process.&lt;ref name="Ostrom 2009 419–422"/&gt;

Another proposed boundary solution is to remove the social from the dilemma, by means of [[privatization]]. This restructuring of incentives would remove the temptation to place individual needs above group needs. However, it is not easy to privatize moveable resources such as fish, water, and clean air. Privatization also raises concerns about social justice as not everyone may be able to get an equal share. Privatization might also erode people’s intrinsic motivation to cooperate, by externalizing the [[locus of control]].

In society, social units which face a social dilemma within are typically embedded in interaction with other groups, often competition for resources of different kinds. Once this is modeled the social dilemma is strongly attenuated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=see for example Gunnthorsdottir, A. and Rapoport, A.|title=Embedding social dilemmas in intergroup competition reduces free-riding|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|date=2006|volume=101|issue=2|pages=184–199; also contains a survey of the relevant literature|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2005.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many additional structural solutions which modify the social dilemma, both from the inside and from the outside. The likelihood of successfully co-managing a shared resource, successfully organizing to self-govern, or successfully cooperating in a social dilemma depends on many variables, from the nature of the resource system, to the nature of the social system the actors are a part of, to the political position of external authorities, to the ability to communicate effectively, to the rules-in-place regarding the management of the commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ostrom|first=Elinor|title=A diagnostic approach for going beyond panaceas|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=25 September 2007|volume=104|issue=39|pages=15181–15187|doi=10.1073/pnas.0702288104|pmid=17881578|pmc=2000497}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, ''sub-optimal'' or ''failed'' results in a social dilemma (and perhaps the need for privatization or an external authority) tend to occur "when resource users do ''not'' know who all is involved, do not have a foundation of trust and reciprocity, cannot communicate, have no established rules, and lack effective monitoring and sanctioning mechanisms." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poteete, Janssen, and Ostrom|title=Working Together: Collective Action, the Commons, and Multiple Methods in Practice|year=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusions==

Close examination reveals that social dilemmas underlie many of the most pressing global issues, from [[climate change]] to [[conflict escalation]]. Their widespread importance warrants widespread understanding of the main types of dilemmas and accompanying paradigms. Fortunately, the literature on the subject is expanding to accommodate the pressing need to understand social dilemmas as the basis for real-world problems.

Research in this area is applied to areas such as organizational welfare, public health, local and global environmental change. The emphasis is shifting from pure laboratory research towards research testing combinations of motivational, strategic, and structural solutions. It is encouraging that researchers from various behavioral sciences are developing unifying theoretical frameworks to study social dilemmas (like evolutionary theory; or the Social-Ecological Systems framework developed by [[Elinor Ostrom]] and her colleagues). For instance, there is a burgeoning [[neuroeconomics]] literature studying brain correlates of decision-making in social dilemmas with neuroscience methods. The interdisciplinary nature of the study of social dilemmas does not fit into the conventional distinctions between fields, and demands a multidisciplinary approach that transcends divisions between [[economics]], [[political science]], and [[psychology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9715">A '''surrogate model''' is an engineering method used when an outcome of interest cannot be easily directly measured, so a model of the outcome is used instead. Most engineering design problems require experiments and/or simulations to evaluate design objective and constraint functions as function of design variables.  For example, in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing, an engineer simulates the air flow around the wing for different shape variables (length, curvature, material, ..).  For many real world problems, however, a single simulation can take many minutes, hours, or even days to complete.  As a result, routine tasks such as design optimization, design space exploration, sensitivity analysis and ''what-if'' analysis become impossible since they require thousands or even millions of simulation evaluations.

One way of alleviating this burden is by constructing approximation models, known as '''surrogate models''', [[Response surface methodology|response surface models]], ''metamodels'' or ''emulators'', that mimic the behavior of the simulation model as closely as possible while being computationally cheap(er) to evaluate. Surrogate models are constructed using a data-driven, bottom-up approach. The exact, inner working of the simulation code is not assumed to be known (or even understood), solely the input-output behavior is important. A model is constructed based on modeling the response of the simulator to a limited number of intelligently chosen data points. This approach is also known as behavioral modeling or black-box modeling, though the terminology is not always consistent.  When only a single design variable is involved, the process is known as [[curve fitting]].

Though using surrogate models in lieu of experiments and simulations in engineering design is more common, surrogate modelling may be used in many other areas of science where there are expensive experiments and/or function evaluations.

==Goals==

The scientific challenge of surrogate modeling is the generation of a surrogate that is as accurate as possible, using as few simulation evaluations as possible. The process comprises three major steps which may be interleaved iteratively:

* Sample selection (also known as sequential design, optimal experimental design (OED) or active learning)
* Construction of the surrogate model and optimizing the model parameters (bias–variance trade-off)
* Appraisal of the accuracy of the surrogate.

The accuracy of the surrogate depends on the number and location of samples (expensive experiments or simulations) in the design space. Various [[design of experiments]] (DOE) techniques cater to different sources of errors, in particular, errors due to noise in the data or errors due to an improper surrogate model.

==Types of surrogate models==

The most popular surrogate models are polynomial [[response surface]]s, [[kriging]], [[Gradient-Enhanced Kriging (GEK)]], [[radial basis function]], [[support vector machine]]s, [[space mapping]],&lt;ref name="space mapping"&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1262727 J.W. Bandler, Q. Cheng, S.A. Dakroury, A.S. Mohamed, M.H. Bakr, K. Madsen and J. Søndergaard, "Space mapping: the state of the art," IEEE Trans. Microwave Theory Tech., vol. 52, no. 1, pp. 337-361, Jan. 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[artificial neural networks]]. For some problems, the nature of true function is not known a priori so it is not clear which surrogate model will be most accurate. In addition, there is no consensus on how to obtain the most reliable estimates of the accuracy of a given surrogate.
Many other problems have known physics properties. In these cases, physics-based surrogates such as [[space-mapping]] based models are the most efficient.&lt;ref name="space mapping" /&gt;

A recent survey of surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization techniques can be found in.&lt;ref&gt;Jin Y (2011). Surrogate-assisted evolutionary computation: Recent advances and future challenges. Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 1(2):61–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanning two decades of development and engineering applications, Rayas-Sanchez reviews aggressive [[space mapping]] exploiting surrogate models.&lt;ref&gt;J.E. Rayas-Sanchez,[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7423860&amp;action=search&amp;sortType=&amp;rowsPerPage=&amp;searchField=Search_All&amp;matchBoolean=true&amp;queryText=(%22Document%20Title%22:simplicity%20in%20asm) "Power in simplicity with ASM: tracing the aggressive space mapping algorithm over two decades of development and engineering applications"], IEEE Microwave Magazine, vol. 17, no. 4, pp. 64-76, April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Razavi et al. has published a state-of-the-art review of surrogate models used in water resources management field. &lt;ref&gt; Razavi, S., B. A.Tolson, and D. H.Burn (2012), Review of surrogate modeling in water resources, Water Resour. Res., 48, W07401, doi: 10.1029/2011WR011527. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Invariance properties==
Recently proposed comparison-based surrogate models (e.g. ranking [[support vector machine]]) for [[evolutionary algorithms]], such as [[CMA-ES]], allow to preserve some invariance properties of surrogate-assisted optimizers:

*1. Invariance with respect to monotonous transformations of the function (scaling)
*2. Invariance with respect to [[orthogonal transform]]ations of the search space (rotation).

==Applications==

An important distinction can be made between two different applications of surrogate models: design optimization and design space approximation (also known as emulation).

In surrogate model based optimization an initial surrogate is constructed using some of the available budget of expensive experiments and/or simulations. The remaining experiments/simulations are run for designs which the surrogate model predicts may have promising performance. The process usually takes the form of the following search/update procedure.

*1. Initial sample selection (the experiments and/or simulations to be run)
*2. Construct surrogate model
*3. Search surrogate model (the model can be searched extensively, e.g. using a [[genetic algorithm]], as it is cheap to evaluate)
*4. Run and update experiment/simulation at new location(s) found by search and add to sample
*5. Iterate steps 2 to 4 until out of time or design 'good enough'

Depending on the type of surrogate used and the complexity of the problem, the process may converge on a local or global optimum, or perhaps none at all.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, D.R (2001), "A taxonomy of global optimization methods based on
response surfaces," Journal of Global Optimization, 21:345–383.&lt;/ref&gt;

In design space approximation, one is not interested in finding the optimal parameter vector but rather in the global behavior of the system. Here the surrogate is tuned to mimic the underlying model as closely as needed over the complete design space. Such surrogates are a useful, cheap way to gain insight into the global behavior of the system. Optimization can still occur as a post processing step, although with no update procedure (see above) the optimum found cannot be validated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8862">In [[statistical mechanics]], the '''Temperley–Lieb algebra''' is an algebra from which are built certain [[transfer matrix|transfer matrices]], invented by [[Harold Neville Vazeille Temperley|Neville Temperley]] and [[Elliott H. Lieb|Elliott Lieb]]. It is also related to  [[integrable model]]s, [[knot theory]] and the [[braid group]], [[quantum groups]] and [[subfactor]]s of [[von Neumann algebra]]s.

==Definition==

Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be a [[commutative ring]] and fix &lt;math&gt;\delta \in R&lt;/math&gt;. The Temperley–Lieb algebra &lt;math&gt;TL_n(\delta)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[algebra (ring theory)|&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-algebra]] generated by the elements &lt;math&gt;U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;, subject to the Jones relations: 
*&lt;math&gt;U_i^2 = \delta U_i&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq n-1&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;U_i U_{i+1} U_i = U_i&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq n-2&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;U_i U_{i-1} U_i = U_i&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;2 \leq i \leq n-1&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;U_i U_j = U_j U_i&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i,j \leq n-1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|i-j| \neq 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;TL_n(\delta)&lt;/math&gt; may be represented diagrammatically as the vector space over noncrossing pairings on a rectangle with ''n'' points on two opposite sides.  The five basis elements of &lt;math&gt;TL_3(\delta)&lt;/math&gt; are the following:

[[File:Temperley-lieb (horizontal).svg|340px|Basis of the Temperley–Lieb algebra &lt;math&gt;TL_3(\delta)&lt;/math&gt;]].

Multiplication on basis elements can be performed by placing two rectangles side by side, and replacing any closed loops by a factor of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, for example:

[[File:Factor-a.svg|50px]]  ×  [[File:Factor-b.svg|50px]]  =  [[File:Factor-a.svg|50px]][[File:Factor-b.svg|50px]]  =  &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;  [[File:Concatenation-ab.svg|50px]].

The identity element is the diagram in which each point is connected to the one directly across the rectangle from it, and the generator &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; is the diagram in which the ''i''th point is connected to the ''i+1''th point, the ''2n − i + 1''th point is connected to the ''2n − i''th point, and all other points are connected to the point directly across the rectangle.  The generators of &lt;math&gt;TL_5(\delta)&lt;/math&gt; are:

[[File:Temperley-Lieb (generateurs).svg|340px|Generators of the Temperley–Lieb algebra &lt;math&gt;TL_5(\delta)&lt;/math&gt;]]

From left to right, the unit 1 and the generators U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, U&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

The Jones relations can be seen graphically:

[[File:E 2 Temperley.svg|50px]] [[File:E 2 Temperley.svg|50px]]  =  &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;  [[File:E 2 Temperley.svg|50px]]

[[File:E 2 Temperley.svg|50px]] [[File:E 3 Temperley.svg|50px]] [[File:E 2 Temperley.svg|50px]]  =  [[File:E 2 Temperley.svg|50px]]

[[File:E 1 Temperley.svg|50px]] [[File:E 4 Temperley.svg|50px]]  =  [[File:E 4 Temperley.svg|50px]] [[File:E 1 Temperley.svg|50px]]

==The Temperley-Lieb Hamiltonian==

Consider an interaction-round-a-face model e.g. a square [[Lattice model (physics)|lattice model]] and let &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be the number of sites on the lattice. Following Temperley and Lieb&lt;ref&gt;Temperley N. and Lieb E., (1971), ''Relations between the 'Percolation' and 'Colouring' Problem and other Graph-Theoretical Problems Associated with Regular Planar Lattices: Some Exact Results for the 'Percolation' Problem'', Proc. R. Soc. A 322 251.&lt;/ref&gt; we define the Temperley-Lieb [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|hamiltonian]] (the TL hamiltonian) as

&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{H} = \sum_{j=1}^{L-1} (1 - e_j) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e_j =  U(\lambda)/\sin\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, for some spectral parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in R&lt;/math&gt;.

===Applications===

We will firstly consider the case &lt;math&gt;L = 3&lt;/math&gt;. The TL hamiltonian is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H} = 2 - e_1 - e_2 &lt;/math&gt;, namely 

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;  =  2  [[File:Unit 3 Temperley.svg|50px]]  -  [[File:E 1 3 Temperley.svg|50px]]  -  [[File:E 2 3 Temperley.svg|50px]].

We have two possible states,

[[File:BS1-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]] and [[File:BS2-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]].

In acting by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; on these states, we find

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; [[File:BS1-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]]  =  2  [[File:Unit 3 Temperley.svg|50px]][[File:BS1-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]]  -  [[File:E 1 3 Temperley.svg|50px]][[File:BS1-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]]  -  [[File:E 2 3 Temperley.svg|50px]][[File:BS1-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]]  =  [[File:BS1-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]]  -  [[File:BS2-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]],

and

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; [[File:BS2-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]]  =  2  [[File:Unit 3 Temperley.svg|50px]][[File:BS2-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]]  -  [[File:E 1 3 Temperley.svg|50px]][[File:BS2-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]]  -  [[File:E 2 3 Temperley.svg|50px]][[File:BS2-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]]  =  -  [[File:BS1-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]]  +  [[File:BS2-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]].

Writing &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; as a matrix in the basis of possible states we have,

&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{H} = \left(\begin{array}{rr}
1 &amp; -1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The eigenvector of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; with the ''lowest'' [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue]] is known as the [[ground state]]. In this case, the lowest eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvector]] is &lt;math&gt;\psi_0 = (1, 1)&lt;/math&gt;. As we vary the number of sites &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; we find the following table&lt;ref name="bach"&gt;Batchelor M., de Gier J. and Nienhuis B., (2001), The quantum symmetric &lt;math&gt;XXZ&lt;/math&gt; chain at &lt;math&gt;\Delta = -1/2&lt;/math&gt;, alternating-sign matrices and plane partitions, J. Phys. A 34, L265-L270.&lt;/ref&gt;

where we have used the notation &lt;math&gt;m_n = (m, \ldots, m)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-times e.g. &lt;math&gt;5_2 = (5, 5)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Combinatorial Properties===
An interesting observation is that the largest components of the ground state of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; have a combinatorial enumeration as we vary the number of sites,&lt;ref&gt;de Gier J., (2005), Loops, matchings and alternating-sign matrices, Discrete Mathematics Volume 298, Issues 1-3, Pages 365-388.&lt;/ref&gt; as was first observed by [[Murray Batchelor]], Jan de Gier and Bernard Nienhuis.&lt;ref name="bach"&gt;Batchelor M., de Gier J. and Nienhuis B., (2001), The quantum symmetric &lt;math&gt;XXZ&lt;/math&gt; chain at &lt;math&gt;\Delta = -1/2&lt;/math&gt;, alternating-sign matrices and plane partitions, J. Phys. A 34, L265-L270.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the resources of the [[on-line encyclopedia of integer sequences]], Batchelor ''et al.'' found, for an even numbers of sites 

&lt;math&gt;
1, 2, 11, 170, \ldots = \prod_{j=0}^{n-1} \left( 3j + 1\right)\frac{ (2j)!(6j)!}{(4j)!(4j + 1)!}
&lt;/math&gt;

and for an odd numbers of sites 

&lt;math&gt;
1, 3, 26, 646, \ldots = \prod_{j=0}^{n-1} (3j+2)\frac{ (2j + 2)!(6j + 3)!}{(4j + 2)!(4j + 3)!}.

The '''triple bottom line''' (or otherwise noted as '''TBL''' or '''3BL''') is an [[accounting]] framework with three parts: social, environmental (or ecological) and financial. Some organizations have adopted the TBL framework to evaluate their performance in a broader perspective to create greater business value.&lt;ref name=IBR&gt;Slaper, Timothy F. and Hall, Tanya J. (2011). [http://www.ibrc.indiana.edu/ibr/2011/spring/article2.html "The Triple Bottom Line: What Is It and How Does It Work?"] ''Indiana Business Review''. Spring 2011, Volume 86, No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Business writer [[John Elkington (business author)|John Elkington]] claims to have coined the phrase in 1994.&lt;ref name=recall&gt;Elkington, J. (2018), "25 Years Ago I Coined the Phrase "Triple Bottom Line." Here's Why It's Time to Rethink It", ''Harvard Business Review'', 25 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Triple Bottom Line|url=http://www.economist.com/node/14301663|accessdate=14 August 2014|publisher=The Economist|date=November 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In traditional business accounting and common usage, the "[[bottom line]]" refers to either the "profit" or "loss", which is usually recorded at the very bottom line on a statement of revenue and expenses. Over the last 50 years, environmentalists and [[social justice]] advocates have struggled to bring a broader definition of bottom line into public consciousness by introducing [[full cost accounting]]. For example, if a corporation shows a monetary profit, but their asbestos mine causes thousands of deaths from [[asbestosis]], and their [[copper mine]] pollutes a river, and the government ends up spending taxpayer money on health care and river clean-up, how do we perform a full societal [[cost benefit analysis]]? The triple bottom line adds two more "bottom lines": social and environmental (ecological) concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/ges/umw/dos/nac/den/en3106180.htm Sustainability – From Principle To Practice] ''[[Goethe-Institut]]'', March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; With the ratification of the [[United Nations]] and [[ICLEI]] TBL standard for urban and community accounting in early 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/delc/Portals/119/industrryRoleOfIndclean.pdf|title=Enhancing the role of industry through for example, private-public partnerships], May 2011. [[United Nations Environment Programme]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; this became the dominant approach to [[public sector]] full cost accounting. Similar UN standards apply to [[natural capital]] and [[human capital]] measurement to assist in measurements required by TBL, e.g. the EcoBudget standard for reporting [[ecological footprint]]. Use of the TBL is fairly widespread in [[South African media]], as found in a 1990–2008 study of worldwide national newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262009650_What_the_Papers_Say_Trends_in_Sustainability_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_115_Leading_National_Newspapers_Worldwide|title=What the Papers Say: Trends in Sustainability.

An example of an organization seeking a triple bottom line would be a [[social enterprise]] run as a non-profit, but earning income by offering opportunities for handicapped people who have been labelled "unemployable", to earn a living by [[recycling]]. The organization earns a profit, which is controlled by a volunteer Board, and ploughed back into the community. The social benefit is the meaningful employment of disadvantaged citizens, and the reduction in the society's welfare or disability costs. The environmental benefit comes from the recycling accomplished. In the [[private sector]], a commitment to [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) implies a commitment to transparent reporting about the business' material impact for good on the environment and people. Triple bottom line is one framework for reporting this material impact. This is distinct from the more limited changes required to deal only with ecological issues. The triple bottom line has also been extended to encompass four pillars, known as the quadruple bottom line (QBL). The fourth pillar denotes a future-oriented approach (future generations, intergenerational equity, etc.). It is a long-term outlook that sets sustainable development and sustainability concerns apart from previous social, environmental, and economic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waite|first=Marilyn|date=2013-11-18|title=SURF Framework for a Sustainable Economy|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jms/article/view/27508|journal=Journal of Management and Sustainability|language=en|volume=3|issue=4|pages=25|doi=10.5539/jms.v3n4p25|issn=1925-4733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The challenges of putting the TBL into practice relate to the measurement of social and ecological categories. Despite this, the TBL framework enables organizations to take a longer-term perspective and thus evaluate the future consequences of decisions.&lt;ref name=IBR /&gt;

==Definition==
[[Sustainable development]] was defined by the [[Brundtland Commission]] of the United Nations in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldfinance.com/banking/egypts-sustainable-finance-trailblazer|title=Egypt’s sustainable finance trailblazer|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Triple bottom line (TBL) accounting expands the traditional reporting framework to take into account social and environmental performance in addition to financial performance.

In 1981, [[Social enterprise|Freer Spreckley]] first articulated the triple bottom line in a publication called 'Social Audit - A Management Tool for Co-operative Working'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Audit: A Management Tool for Co-operative Working|last=Spreckley|first=Freer|publisher=Beechwood College|year=1981|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, he argued that enterprises should measure and report on financial performance, social wealth creation, and environmental responsibility. The phrase "triple bottom line" was articulated more fully by [[John Elkington (business author)|John Elkington]] in his 1997 book ''Cannibals with Forks: the Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business'.'&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/963459936|title=Cannibals with forks : the triple bottom line of 21st century business|last=Elkington|first=John|date=|publisher=Capstone|year=1999|isbn=9780865713925|location=Oxford|pages=|oclc=963459936|author-link=John Elkington (business author)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In articulating the concept of triple bottom line, Elkington has also made reference to Jed Emerson's concept of [[blended value]], which refers to the idea that all value consists of social, environmental, and financial components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Elkington |first1=John |title=Sustainability should not be consigned to history by Shared Value |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-with-john-elkington/shared-value-john-elkington-sustainability |website=The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=November 13th, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Triple Bottom Line Investing'' group advocating and publicizing these principles was founded in 1998 by [[Robert J. Rubinstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/devinthorpe/2018/05/22/one-key-to-impact-investing-start-big/#eab84e15ddb9|title=One Key To Impact Investing: Start Big|last=Thorpe|first=Devin|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For reporting their efforts companies may demonstrate their commitment to [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) through the following:

*Top-level involvement (CEO, Board of Directors)
*Policy Investments
*Programs
*Signatories to voluntary standards
*Principles (UN Global Compact-Ceres Principles)
*Reporting (Global Reporting Initiative)

The concept of TBL demands that a company's responsibility lies with [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] rather than [[shareholders]]. In this case, "stakeholders" refers to anyone who is influenced, either directly or indirectly, by the actions of the firm. Examples of stakeholders include employees, customers, suppliers, local residents, government agencies, and creditors. According to the [[stakeholder theory]], the business entity should be used as a vehicle for coordinating stakeholder interests, instead of maximizing shareholder (owner) profit. A growing number of financial institutions incorporate a triple bottom line approach in their work. It is at the core of the business of banks in the [[Global Alliance for Banking on Values]], for example.

The [[Detroit]]-based [[Avalon International Breads]] interprets the triple bottom line as consisting of "Earth", "Community", and "Employees".&lt;ref name="Avalon"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avalonbreads.net/about-us/triple-bottom-line/|title=Triple Bottom Line: Earth, Community, Employees|last=|first=|date=|website=Avalon International Breads|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The three bottom lines===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}
The triple bottom line consists of social equity, economic, and environmental factors. The phrase, "people, planet, and profit" to describe the triple bottom line and the goal of [[sustainability]], was coined by John Elkington in 1994 while at Sustain Ability,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and was later used as the title of the Anglo-Dutch oil company Shell's first sustainability report in 1997. As a result, one country in which the 3P concept took deep root was The Netherlands.

==== People, the social equity bottom line ====
The people, social equity, or [[human capital]] bottom line pertains to fair and beneficial business practices toward labour and the community and region in which a corporation conducts its business. A TBL company conceives a reciprocal [[social structure]] in which the well-being of corporate, labour and other stakeholder interests are interdependent.

An enterprise dedicated to the triple bottom line seeks to provide benefit to many constituencies and not to exploit or endanger any group of them. The "upstreaming" of a portion of profit from the marketing of finished goods back to the original producer of raw materials, for example, a farmer in [[fair trade]] agricultural practice, is a common feature. In concrete terms, a TBL business would not use child labour and monitor all contracted companies for child labour exploitation, would pay fair salaries to its workers, would maintain a safe work environment and tolerable working hours, and would not otherwise exploit a community or its labour force. A TBL business also typically seeks to "give back" by contributing to the strength and growth of its community with such things as health care and education. Quantifying this bottom line is relatively new, problematic and often subjective. The [[Global Reporting Initiative]] (GRI) has developed guidelines to enable corporations and [[NGO]]s alike to comparably report on the social impact of a business.

==== Planet, the environmental bottom line ====
The planet, environmental bottom line, or [[natural capital]] bottom line refers to sustainable environmental practices. A TBL company endeavors to benefit the natural order as much as possible or at the least do no harm and minimize environmental impact. A TBL endeavour reduces its [[ecological footprint]] by, among other things, carefully managing its consumption of energy and non-renewables and reducing manufacturing waste as well as rendering waste less [[Toxicity|toxic]] before disposing of it in a safe and legal manner. "[[Cradle to grave]]" is uppermost in the thoughts of TBL manufacturing businesses, which typically conduct a [[life cycle assessment]] of products to determine what the true environmental cost is from the growth and harvesting of raw materials to manufacture to distribution to eventual disposal by the end user.

Currently, the cost of disposing of non-degradable or toxic products is borne financially by governments and environmentally by the residents near the disposal site and elsewhere. In TBL thinking, an enterprise which produces and markets a product which will create a waste problem should not be given a free ride by society. It would be more equitable for the business which manufactures and sells a problematic product to bear part of the cost of its ultimate disposal.

Ecologically destructive practices, such as overfishing or other endangering depletions of resources are avoided by TBL companies. Often environmental sustainability is the more profitable course for a business in the long run. Arguments that it costs more to be environmentally sound are often specious when the course of the business is analyzed over a period of time. Generally, sustainability reporting metrics are better quantified and standardized for environmental issues than for social ones. A number of respected reporting institutes and registries exist including the Global Reporting Initiative, CERES, Institute 4 Sustainability and others.

The ecological bottom line is akin to the concept of [[eco-capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Gaia Atlas of Green Economics|last=Ekins|first=Paul|publisher=Anchor Books|year=1992|isbn=0-385-41914-7|location=|page=191|pages=|author-link=Paul Ekins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Profit, the economic bottom line ====
The profit or economic bottom line deals with the economic value created by the organization after deducting the cost of all inputs, including the cost of the capital tied up. It therefore differs from traditional accounting definitions of profit. In the original concept, within a sustainability framework, the "profit" aspect needs to be seen as the real economic benefit enjoyed by the host society.  It is the real economic impact the organization has on its economic environment.  This is often confused to be limited to the internal profit made by a company or organization (which nevertheless remains an essential starting point for the computation).  Therefore, an original TBL approach cannot be interpreted as simply traditional corporate accounting profit ''plus'' social and environmental impacts unless the "profits" of other entities are included as a social benefit.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Subsequent development==

Following the initial publication of the triple bottom line concept, students and practitioners have sought greater detail in how the pillars can be evaluated.

The ''people'' concept for example can be viewed in three dimensions – organisational needs, individual needs, and community issues.

Equally, ''profit'' is a function of both a healthy sales stream, which needs a high focus on customer service, coupled with the adoption of a strategy to develop new customers to replace those that die away.

And ''planet'' can be divided into a multitude of subdivisions, although [[Waste hierarchy|reduce, reuse and recycle]] is a succinct way of steering through this division.

=== Integrated Bottom Line (IBL) ===
While Triple Bottom Line inspires companies to take into consideration people, profit and planet simultaneously, Integrated Bottom Line (IBL) takes the concept a step further and encourages companies to integrate their financial, economic and social performance reporting into one integrated balance sheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Integrated Management: How Sustainability Creates Value for Any Business|last=Sroufe|first=Robert|publisher=Emerald Publishing|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrating these performance measurements into one report will provide a more holistic look into a company's performance and assist decision makers in understanding opportunities for long term value creation that can be leveraged during long term organizational planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=One Report: Integrated Reporting for a Sustainable Strategy|last=Eccles|first=Robert|last2=Krzus|first2=Michael|publisher=Wiley|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is evidence in support an [[Integrated management|Integrated Management]] approach that prioritizes IBL reporting and asserts that enterprises with strong integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) data into reporting and subsequent decision making often out perform firms with weak ESG integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Integrated Management: How Sustainability Creates Value for Any Business|last=Sroufe|first=Robert|publisher=Emerald Publishing|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be largely attributed to the new opportunities for value creation that are discovered through the process of collecting, analyzing and understanding the ESG data collected and what it means for a company's long term success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sroufe|first=Robert|date=July 2017|title=Integration and Organizational Change Towards Sustainability|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318126290_Integration_and_Organizational_Change_Towards_Sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=162|pages=315-329|via=Research Gate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prioritizing an IBL approach begins with changing the way we think about traditional financial measurements as these do not take into consideration the full extent of the short and long term impacts of a decision or action. Instead, Return on Investment can be expanded to Return on Integration, Internal Rate of Return can evolve into Integrated Rate of Return and instead of focusing on Net Present Value, companies can plan for Integrated Future Value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Integrated Management: How Sustainability Creates Value for Any Business|last=Sroufe|first=Robert|publisher=Emerald Publishing|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Supporting arguments==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}
The following business-based arguments support the concept of TBL:

*Reaching untapped market potential: TBL companies can find financially profitable niches which were missed when money alone was the driving factor. Examples include:

# Adding [[ecotourism]] or [[geotourism]] to an already rich tourism market such as the [[Dominican Republic]]
# Developing profitable methods to assist existing NGOs with their missions such as fundraising, reaching clients, or creating networking opportunities with multiple NGOs
# Providing products or services which benefit underserved populations and/or the environment which are also financially profitable.

*Adapting to new business sectors: While the number of [[social enterprises]] is growing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/the-peoples-business|title=The People's Business 2013|last=|first=|date=|work=Social Enterprise UK|access-date=July 15, 2015|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the entry of the [[B Corporation|B Corp movement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogertrapp/2015/03/29/business-leaders-urged-to-find-a-purpose-in-life/|title=Business Leaders Urged To Find A Purpose In Life|date=2015|website=Forbes|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last1=Trapp|first1=Roger|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is more demand from consumers and investors for an accounting for social and environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/gx-wef-2015-millennial-survey-executivesummary.pdf|title=Mind  the gaps. The 2015 Deloitte Millennial survey|last=|first=|date=2015|website=Deloitt|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Fair trade|Fair Trade]] and Ethical Trade companies require ethical and sustainable practices from all of their suppliers and service providers.

[[Fiscal policy]] of governments usually claims to be concerned with identifying social and natural deficits on a less formal basis. However, such choices may be guided more by [[ideology]] than by [[economics]]. The primary benefit of embedding one approach to measurement of these deficits would be first to direct [[monetary policy]] to reduce them, and eventually achieve a global [[monetary reform]] by which they could be systematically and globally reduced in some uniform way.

The argument is that the [[Earth]]'s [[carrying capacity]] is at risk, and that in order to avoid catastrophic breakdown of [[climate]] or [[ecosystem]]s, there is need for comprehensive reform of [[Global financial system|global financial institutions]] similar in scale to what was undertaken at [[Bretton Woods conference|Bretton Woods]] in 1944.

With the emergence of an externally consistent [[green economics]] and agreement on definitions of potentially contentious terms such as [[full-cost accounting]], [[natural capital]] and [[social capital]], the prospect of formal metrics for ecological and social loss or risk has grown less remote since the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In the [[United Kingdom]] in particular, the London Health Observatory has undertaken a formal programme to address social deficits via a fuller understanding of what "social capital" is, how it functions in a real [[community]] (that being the [[City of London]]), and how losses of it tend to require both [[financial capital]] and significant political and social attention from [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s and professionals to help resolve.  The data they rely on is extensive, building on decades of statistics of the [[Greater London Council]] since [[World War II]].  Similar studies have been undertaken in [[North America]].

Studies of the [[value of Earth]] have tried to determine what might constitute an ecological or natural life deficit. The [[Kyoto Protocol]] relies on some measures of this sort, and actually relies on some [[value of life]] calculations that, among other things, are explicit about the ratio of the price of a human life between developed and developing nations (about 15 to 1). While the motive of this number was to simply assign responsibility for a cleanup, such stark honesty opens not just an economic but political door to some kind of negotiation &amp;mdash; presumably to reduce that ratio in time to something seen as more equitable. As it is, people in developed nations can be said to benefit 15 times more from [[ecological devastation]] than in developing nations, in pure financial terms. According to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]], they are thus obliged to pay 15 times more per life to avoid a loss of each such life to [[climate change]] &amp;mdash; the [[Kyoto Protocol]] seeks to implement exactly this formula, and is therefore sometimes cited as a first step towards getting nations to accept formal [[legal liability|liability]] for damage inflicted on ecosystems shared globally.

Advocacy for triple bottom line reforms is common in [[Green Parties]]. Some of the measures undertaken in the [[European Union]] towards the [[Euro]] currency integration standardize the reporting of ecological and social losses in such a way as to seem to endorse in principle the notion of unified accounts, or [[unit of account]], for these deficits.

To address financial bottom line profitability concerns, some argue that focusing on the TBL will indeed increase profit for the shareholders in the long run. In practice, [[John Mackey (businessman)|John Mackey]], CEO of [[Whole Foods]], uses Whole Foods's Community Giving Days as an example. On days when Whole Foods donates 5% of their sales to charity, this action benefits the community, creates goodwill with customers, and energizes employees—which may lead to increased, sustainable profitability in the long-run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/08/20/whole-foods-john-mackey/|title=John Mackey: The conscious capitalist|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
While many people agree with the importance of good social conditions and preservation of the environment, there are also many who disagree with the triple bottom line as the way to enhance these conditions. The following are the reasons why:

* ''Reductive method'': Concurrently the environment comes to be treated as an externality or background feature, an externality that tends not to have the human dimension build into its definition. Thus, in many writings, even in those critical of the triple-bottom-line approach, the social becomes a congeries of miscellaneous considerations left over from the other two prime categories.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;{{Cite journal | year=2010 | last1= Scerri | first1= Andy | last2= James | first2= Paul | authorlink2= Paul James (academic) | title= Accounting for sustainability: Combining qualitative and quantitative research in developing ‘indicators’ of sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/3230887/Accounting_for_Sustainability_Combining_Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Research_in_Developing_Indicators | journal= International Journal of Social Research Methodology | volume= 13 | issue= 1 | pages= 41–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative approaches, such as [[Circles of Sustainability]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul James and Andy Scerri, ‘Auditing Cities through Circles of Sustainability’, Mark Amen, Noah J. Toly, Patricia L. Carney and Klaus Segbers, eds, ''Cities and Global Governance'', Ashgate, Farnham, 2011, pp. 111–36.&lt;/ref&gt; that treat the economic as a social domain, alongside and in relation to the ecological, the political and the cultural are now being considered as more appropriate for understanding institutions, cities and regions.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Scerri | first1 = A. | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.02.027 | title = Ends in view: The capabilities approach in ecological/sustainability economics | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 77 | pages = 7–10 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liam Magee, &amp; Andy Scerri (2012) ‘From Issues to Indicators: A Response to Grosskurth and Rotmans’, Local Environment 17(8): 915-933.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Social inertia|Inertia]]'': The difficulty of achieving global agreement on [[simultaneous policy]] may render such measures at best advisory, and thus unenforceable. For example, people may be unwilling to undergo a [[Depression (economics)|depression]] or even sustained [[recession]] to replenish lost [[ecosystem]]s. {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}
* ''Application'': According to Fred Robins' ''The Challenge of TBL: A Responsibility to Whom?'' one of the major weaknesses of the TBL framework is its ability to be applied in the practical world.
* ''Equating ecology with environment'': TBL is seen to be disregarding ecological sustainability with environmental effects, where in reality both economic and social viability is dependent on environmental well being. While [[greenwashing]] is not new, its use has increased over recent years to meet consumer demand for environmentally friendly goods and services. The problem is compounded by lax enforcement by regulatory agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, the Competition Bureau in Canada, and the Committee of Advertising Practice and the Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice in the United Kingdom. Critics of the practice suggest that the rise of greenwashing, paired with ineffective regulation, contributes to consumer skepticism of all green claims, and diminishes the power of the consumer in driving companies toward greener solutions for manufacturing processes and business operation.
* ''Time dimension'': While the triple bottom line incorporates the social, economical and environmental (People, Planet, Profit) dimensions of sustainable development, it does not explicitly address the fourth dimension: time. The time dimension focuses on preserving current value in all three other dimensions for later. This means assessment of short term, longer term and long term consequences of any action.&lt;ref&gt;Lozano, R. (2012). "Towards better embedding sustainability into companies’ systems: an analysis of voluntary corporate initiatives," ''Journal of Cleaner Production'' 25 pp. 14-26&lt;/ref&gt;
*"One problem with the triple bottom line is that the three separate accounts cannot easily be added up. It is difficult to measure the planet and people accounts in the same terms as profits—that is, in terms of cash."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/14301663|title=Triple bottom line -  It consists of three Ps: profit, people and planet|last=|first=|date=|website=The Economist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to TBL being augmented with [[Cost–benefit analysis|cost-benefit analysis]] in [[Triple Bottom Line (TBL) Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA)|Triple Bottom Line Cost Benefit Analysis (TBL-CBA)]].
*Elkington himself has called for a rethink on TBL and a "product recall" on use of the concept. He argues that the original idea was to encourage businesses to manage the wider economic, social and environmental impacts of their operations, but its practical use as an accounting tool has now undermined its value.&lt;ref name=recall /&gt;
*This is summarised below as:
** attempting to divert the attention of regulators and deflating pressure for regulatory change;
** seeking to persuade critics, such as non-government organisations, that they are both well-intentioned and have changed their ways;
** seeking to expand market share at the expense of those rivals not involved in greenwashing; this is especially attractive if little or no additional expenditure is required to change ''performance''; alternatively, a company can engage in greenwashing in an attempt to narrow the perceived 'green' advantage of a rival;
** reducing staff turnover and making it easier to attract staff in the first place;
** making the company seem attractive for potential investors, especially those interested in ethical investment or socially responsive investment.
** inability to add up the three accounts unless tools such as [[Cost–benefit analysis|cost-benefit analysis]] are added to put social and environmental [[Externality|externalities]] in monetary terms.

==Legislation==
A focus on people, planet and profit has led to legislation changes around the world, often through [[social enterprise]] or [[Social investing|social investment]] or through the introduction of a new legal form, the [[Community Interest Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Interest Companies|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-regulator-of-community-interest-companies|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[BCorp]] movement has been part of a call for legislation change to allow and encourage a focus on social and environmental impact, with BCorp a legal form for a company focused on "stakeholders, not just shareholders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Becoming a Legal BCorp|url=https://www.bcorporation.net/become-a-b-corp/how-to-become-a-b-corp/legal-roadmap|publisher=BCorp|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western Australia]], the triple bottom line was adopted as a part of the State Sustainability Strategy,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070830000447/http://www.sustainability.dpc.wa.gov.au/docs/Final%20Strategy/SSSFinal.pdf Government of Western Australia. (2003, September). "Hope for the Future: The Western Australia State Sustainability Strategy"], accessed August 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and accepted by the [[Western Australian Government|Government of Western Australia]] but its status was increasingly marginalised by subsequent [[Premier of Western Australia|premier]]s [[Alan Carpenter]] and [[Colin Barnett]].

'''Volunteering''' is generally considered an [[altruistic]] activity where an individual or group provides services for no financial or social gain "to benefit another person, group or organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=John|title=Volunteering|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|date=2000|issue=26|page=215|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.215|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.215|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteering is also renowned for skill development and is often intended to promote goodness or to improve human [[quality of life]]. Volunteering may have positive benefits for the volunteer as well as for the person or community served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benefits of Volunteering|url=http://nationalservice.gov|accessdate=12 April 2017|website=[[Corporation for National and Community Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also intended to make contacts for possible employment. Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they work, such as [[medicine]], [[education]], or [[emergency rescue]]. Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a [[natural disaster]].

==Etymology and history==

The verb was first recorded in 1755. It was derived from the noun ''volunteer'', in [[Circa|C]].1600, "one who offers himself for military service," from the [[Middle French]] ''voluntaire''.&lt;ref name="Etymology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=volunteer|title=Etymology:VOLUNTEER|accessdate=2012-04-30|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the non-military sense, the word was first recorded during the 1630s. The word ''volunteering'' has more recent usage—still predominantly military—coinciding with the phrase ''community service''.&lt;ref name="Etymology" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jocote.org/2010/12/volunteer-whats-in-a-word/|publisher=Jocote.org|accessdate=2012-04-30|title=The origin of the word "Volunteering"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a military context, a [[volunteer military|volunteer army]] is a military body whose soldiers chose to enter service, as opposed to having been conscripted. Such volunteers do not work "for free" and are given regular pay.

===19th century===
During this time, America experienced the [[Great Awakening]]. People became aware of the disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery. Younger people started helping the needy in their communities {{citation needed|reason=no citation|date=September 2015}}. In 1851, the first [[YMCA]] in the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first [[YWCA]]. During the [[American Civil War]], women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the "Angel of the Battlefield" [[Clara Barton]] and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen.  Barton founded the [[American Red Cross]] in 1881 and began mobilizing volunteers for disaster relief operations, including relief for victims of the [[Johnstown Flood]] in 1889.

===20th and 21st centuries===
[[File:Kennedy greeting Peace Corps volunteers, 1961.jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy]] greets volunteers on 28 August 1961]]

The [[Salvation Army]] is one of the oldest and largest organizations working for disadvantaged people. Though it is a [[charity organization]], it has organized a number of volunteering programs since its inception.&lt;ref name="ISBN" /&gt;
Prior to the 19th century, few formal charitable organizations existed to assist people in need.

In the first few decades of the 20th century, several volunteer organizations were founded, including the [[Rotary International]], [[Kiwanis International]], [[Association of Junior Leagues International]], and [[Lions Clubs International]].

[[The Great Depression]] saw one of the first large-scale, nationwide efforts to coordinate volunteering for a specific need. During World War II, thousands of volunteer offices supervised the volunteers who helped with the many needs of the military and the [[home front]], including collecting supplies, entertaining soldiers on leave, and caring for the injured.&lt;ref name="ISBN" /&gt;

After [[World War II]], people shifted the focus of their altruistic passions to other areas, including helping the poor and volunteering overseas. A major development was the [[Peace Corps]] in the United States in 1960. When President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] declared a ''War on Poverty'' in 1964, volunteer opportunities started to expand and continued into the next few decades. The process for finding volunteer work became more formalized, with more volunteer centers forming and new ways to find work appearing on the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref name="ISBN"&gt;{{ISBN|1-86287-376-3}}, Volunteers and Volunteering, The Federation Press&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Corporation for National and Community Service (in 2012), about 64.5 million Americans, or 26.5 percent of the adult population, gave 7.9 billion hours of volunteer service worth $175 billion.  This calculates at about 125–150 hours per year or 3 hours per week at a rate of $22 per hour. Volunteer hours in the UK are similar; the data for other countries is unavailable.

In 1960, after the so called revolutionary war in Cuba ended, Ernesto Che Guevara created the concept of volunteering work. It was created with the intention that workers across the country volunteer a few hours of work on their work centers.

==Types==

=== Volunteering as utilized by service learning programs ===
Many schools on all education levels offer [[service-learning]] programs, which allow students to serve the community through volunteering while earning educational credit.&lt;ref name="MedEdH"&gt;{{Cite web
| title = Medical Education at Harvard
| accessdate = 2014-07-29

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alexander Astin in the foreword to ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'' by Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, Jr.,"...we promote more wide-spread adoption of service-learning in higher education because we see it as a powerful means of preparing students to become more caring and responsible parents and citizens and of helping colleges and universities to make good on their pledge to 'serve society.'"&lt;ref name="Eyler"&gt;{{Citation

    }}&lt;/ref&gt; When describing service learning, the Medical Education at Harvard says, "Service learning unites academic study and volunteer community service in mutually reinforcing ways. ...service learning is characterized by a relationship of partnership: the student learns from the service agency and from the community and, in return, gives energy, intelligence, commitment, time and skills to address human and community needs."&lt;ref name="MedEdH" /&gt; Volunteering in service learning seems to have the result of engaging both mind and heart, thus providing a more powerful learning experience; according to Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, it succeeds by the fact that it "...fosters student development by capturing student interest..."&lt;ref name=Eyler /&gt;{{rp|1–2,8}} While not recognized by everyone as a legitimate approach, research on the efficacy of service learning has grown.&lt;ref name=Eyler /&gt;{{rp|xv-xvii}} Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles conducted a national study of American college students to ascertain the significance of service learning programs,&lt;ref name=Eyler /&gt;{{rp|xvi}} According to Eyler and Giles,"These surveys, conducted before and after a semester of community service, examine the impact of service-learning on students."&lt;ref name=Eyler /&gt;{{rp|xvi}} They describe their experience with students involved in service-learning in this way: "Students like service-learning. When we sit down with a group of students to discuss service-learning experiences, their enthusiasm is unmistakable. ...it is clear that [the students]believe that what they gain from service-learning differs qualitatively from what they often derive from more traditional instruction."&lt;ref name=Eyler /&gt;{{rp|1–2}}

===Skills-based volunteering===
''Skills-based volunteering'' is leveraging the specialized skills and the talents of individuals to strengthen the infrastructure of nonprofits, helping them build and sustain their capacity to successfully achieve their missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalserviceresources.org/sbv|publisher=National Service Resources|title=Need of skills based volunteering for Non-Profit activities}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to traditional volunteering, where specific training is not required.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}  The average hour of traditional volunteering is valued by the Independent Sector at between $18–20 an hour.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.i-to-i.com/personal-development-through-volunteering&lt;/ref&gt; Skills-based volunteering is valued at $40–500 an hour, depending on the market value of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independentsector.org|title=Skills based volunteering|publisher=Independent Sector|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2014&lt;!-- the link is to a site's home page, please link to the specific page that backs up the claim --&gt;}}

===Volunteering in developing countries===
{{Further information|International volunteering}}
[[File:Laura Bush with Ghana Peace Corps volunteers.jpg|thumb|[[Laura Bush]] poses with [[Peace Corps]] volunteers]]
An increasingly popular form of volunteering among young people, particularly [[gap year]] students and graduates, is to travel to communities in the [[developing world]] to work on projects with local organisations. Activities include teaching English, working in orphanages, conservation, assisting non-governmental organizations and medical work. International volunteering often aims to give participants valuable skills and knowledge in addition to benefits to the host community and organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Volunteering abroad|url=http://bma.org.uk/developing-your-career/career-progression/volunteering-abroad|website=BMA|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual volunteering===
{{Further information|Virtual volunteering}}
Also called ''e-volunteering'' or ''online volunteering'', virtual volunteering is a volunteer who completes tasks, in whole or in part, offsite from the organization being assisted. They use the Internet and a home, school, [[telecenter]] or work computer, or other Internet-connected device, such as a [[PDA]] or [[smartphone]]. Virtual volunteering is also known as cyber service, telementoring, and teletutoring, as well as various other names. Virtual volunteering is similar to [[telecommuting]], except that instead of online employees who are paid, these are online volunteers who are not paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinevolunteering.org/en/index.html|publisher=UN Volunteers|accessdate=2012-04-30|title=Online Volunteering|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502044205/http://onlinevolunteering.org/en/index.html|archive-date=2 May 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serviceleader.org/virtual|title=Virtual Volunteering|accessdate=2012-04-30|publisher=Service Leader}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Micro-volunteering===
{{Further information|Micro-volunteering}}
Micro-volunteering is a task performed via an internet-connected device. An individual typically does this task in small, un-paid increments of time. Micro-volunteering is distinct from "virtual volunteering" in that it typically does not require the individual volunteer to go through an application process, screening process, or training period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nonprofit.about.com/od/volunteers/a/microvol.htm| title=Micro-Volunteering via Mobile Phones - Using Spare Time to Micro-Volunteer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-volunteer.org.uk/helpfromhome/micro-volunteering-changing-the-world-in-just-your-pyjamas/ |title=Micro Volunteering - Changing The World In Just Your Pyjamas! |publisher=I-volunteer.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental volunteering===
{{Further information|Environmental volunteering}}

Environmental volunteering refers to the volunteers who contribute towards environmental management or conservation. Volunteers conduct a range of activities including environmental monitoring, ecological restoration such as re-vegetation and weed removal, protecting endangered animals, and educating others about the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=learn.whatvol|title=Environmental Volunteer Work|publisher=PeaceCorps|accessdate=2012-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volunteering in an emergency===
[[File:FEMA - 15322 - Photograph by Andrea Booher taken on 09-05-2005 in Texas.jpg|thumb|Volunteers assist survivors at the Houston Astrodome following [[Hurricane Katrina]] in September 2005.]]
Volunteering often plays a pivotal role in the recovery effort following natural disasters, such as tsunamis, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and earthquakes. For example, the 1995 [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake]] in Japan was a watershed moment, bringing in many first-time [[wikipedia:Great_Hanshin_earthquake#Volunteerism|volunteers for earthquake response]]. The [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]] attracted a large number of volunteers worldwide, deployed by [[non-governmental organization]]s, government agencies, and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2004/usslav/#summary/|publisher=United States Geological Survey|title=USGS Tsunami 2004 Summary|access-date=11 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119233314/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2004/usslav/#summary/|archive-date=19 January 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0504/excerpt2.html|publisher=National Geographic|title=Emergency Volunteering Coverage in NatGeo.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2012 hurricane Sandy emergency, [[Occupy Sandy]] volunteers, formed a ''laterally organized rapid-response team'' that provided much needed help during and after the storm, from food to shelter to reconstruction.  It is an example of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] at work, pooling resources and assistance and leveraging social media.

===Volunteering in schools===

Resource poor schools around the world rely on government support or on efforts from volunteers and private donations, in order to run effectively. In some countries, whenever the economy is down, the need for volunteers and resources increases greatly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatschools.net/news/back-to-school-poll-results.page|title=The Economy's Impact on Back to School|publisher=Great Schools|date=2009-08-06|accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many opportunities available in school systems for volunteers. Yet, there are not many requirements in order to volunteer in a school system. Whether one is a high school or TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) graduate or college student, most schools require just voluntary and selfless effort.&lt;ref name="School Mental Health Project"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smhp.psych.ucla.edu/pdfdocs/volunteer/volunt.pdf|publisher=School Mental Health Project|title=Volunteer teaching effort can help students to learn better in schools|accessdate=2011-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much like the benefits of any type of volunteering there are great rewards for the volunteer, student, and school. In addition to intangible rewards, volunteers can add relevant experience to their resumes. Volunteers who travel to assist may learn foreign culture and language.

Volunteering in schools can be an additional teaching guide for the students and help to fill the gap of local teachers. Cultural and language exchange during teaching and other school activities can be the most essential learning experience for both students and volunteers.&lt;ref name="School Mental Health Project"/&gt;

===Corporate volunteering===
{{Further information|Volunteer grant}}
Benefacto, a volunteering brokerage, describe corporate volunteering as "Companies giving their employees an allowance of paid time off annually, which they use to volunteer at a charity of their choice."&lt;ref&gt;http://benefacto.org/what-is-corporate-volunteering/&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of the companies at the [[Fortune 500]] allow their employees to volunteer during work hours. These formalized Employee Volunteering Programs (EVPs), also called Employer Supported Volunteering (ESV), are regarded as a part of the companies' sustainability efforts and their social responsibility activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcccc.net/index.cfm?fuseaction=document.showDocumentByID&amp;DocumentID=1308|title=Mapping Success in Employee Volunteering - The Drivers of Effectiveness for Employee Volunteering and Giving Programs and Fortune 500 Performance (2009)|publisher=Boston College Center for Corporate Citizenship 2009|accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 40% of Fortune 500 companies provide monetary [[donations]], also known as [[volunteer grant]]s, to nonprofits as a way to recognize employees who dedicate significant amounts of time to volunteering in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qgiv.com/blog/dos-and-donts-for-volunteers/|title=Fortune 500's monetary donation programs for voluntary service|publisher=Qgiv.com|accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the information from [[VolunteerMatch]], a service that provides Employee Volunteering Program solutions, the key drivers for companies that produce and manage EVPs are building [[brand awareness]] and affinity, strengthening trust and loyalty among consumers, enhancing [[corporate image]] and reputation, improving [[employee retention]], increasing [[workforce productivity|employee productivity]] and loyalty, and providing an effective vehicle to reach strategic goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volunteermatch.org/corporations/resources/businesscase.jsp|publisher=VolunteerMatch.org|title= How companies benefit from EVP|accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, David Cameron pledged to give all UK workers employed by companies with more 250 staff mandatory three days’ paid volunteering leave, which if implemented will generate an extra 360 million volunteering hours a year&lt;ref&gt;https://benefacto.org/three-days-paid-volunteering-leave-an-update-from-rob-wilsons-office/&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Community volunteer work===
[[File:Volunteers installing windows at the Sumac Centre.jpg|thumb|Volunteers fit new windows at the [[Sumac Centre]] in [[Nottingham]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom|UK]].]]
Community volunteering refers globally to those who work to improve their local community. This activity commonly occurs through not for profit organizations, local governments and churches; but also encompasses ad-hoc or informal groups such as recreational sports teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winfield|first1=Mark|title=The Essential Volunteer Handbook|publisher=FriesenPress|isbn=978-1-4602-1583-8|url=http://www.markwinfield.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits of community volunteer work ===
There are many proven personal benefits of community volunteerism. Working together with a group of people who have different ethnicity, backgrounds, and views reduces stereotypes. Community volunteerism has also been proven to improve student's academic success.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

According to ''Where's the Learning in Service Learning?'' by Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, immersing oneself into service learning and serving others has many positive effects both academic and personal. Not only does surrounding oneself with new people and learning how to work together as a group help one improve teamwork and relational skills, it reduces stereotypes, increases appreciation of other cultures, and works to allow young people to find others that they relate to.

Eyler and Giles noted that at the beginning and end of a college semester that included three hours of community service a week, students reported a much higher regard for cultural differences. At the end of the semester those who had participated in service-learning were noted as saying that the most important things that they had learned were not to judge others, and to appreciate every type of person because everyone shares some similar key characteristics.

Community volunteer work has proven to be a powerful predictor in students' academic lives and college experience as a whole. Studies have shown that students who participate in community service as a part of their college course of study have a much higher correlation of completing their degree (Astin, 1992;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What Matters in College: Four Critical Years Revisited|last=Astin|first=A.W.|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1992|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pascarella and Terenzini, 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How College Affects Students: Findings and Insights from Twenty Years of Research|last=Pascarella and Terenzini|first=E.T. and P.T.|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1991|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In addition, college students who participate in community volunteer projects as a part of their college experience report finding a much greater relevance in their academic studies after completing community volunteer projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Where's the Learning in Service-Learning|last=Eyler and Giles, Jr.|first=Janet and Dwight|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1999|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to University Health Services, studies have found that volunteering can positively impact a student’s overall mental and emotional health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/wellness/student-volunteering-could-have-health-benefits/|title=Student volunteering could have health benefits|website=www.uhs.wisc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social volunteering or welfare volunteering===
In some European countries government organisations and non-government organisations provide auxiliary positions for a certain period in institutions like hospitals, schools, memorial sites and welfare institutions. The difference to other types of volunteering is that there are strict legal regulations, what organisation is allowed to engage volunteers and about the period a volunteer is allowed to work in a voluntary position. Due to that fact, the volunteer is getting a limited amount as a pocket money from the government. An organization having one of the biggest manpower in [[Europe]] is the German [[Federal volunteers service]] (Bundesfreiwilligendienst), that was founded in 2011, by having more than 35.000 federal volunteers in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bundesfreiwilligendienst.de/fileadmin/de.bundesfreiwilligendienst/content.de/Service/Downloads/BFD_Flyer_engl_web_RZ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A much older institution is the [[Voluntary social year]] (Freiwilliges Soziales Jahr) in [[Austria]] and [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsj.at/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pro-fsj.de/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Volunteering at Major Sporting Events ===
Sochi Olympics 25,000 volunteers worked at the [[2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Sochi Winter Olympics]]. They supported the organisers in more than 20 functional areas: meeting guests, assisting navigation, organising the opening and closing ceremonies, organising food outlets, etc. Volunteer applications were open to any nationals of Russia and other countries. The Sochi 2014 Organising Committee received about 200,000 applications, 8 applicants per place. Volunteers received training over the course of more than a year at 26 volunteer centres in 17 cities across Russia. The majority of participants were between 17 and 22 years old. At the same time, 3000 applications were submitted from people over 55 years old. Some of them worked as volunteers during the [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympics]] in Moscow. It was the first experience with such a large-scale volunteer program in the contemporary Russia.

==== 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia ====
For the first time in its history, Russia will host the FIFA World Cup from June 14 till July 15, 2018. Moreover, it will be the first time the World Cup games will be played both in Europe and Asia. The games will be hosted by 12 stadiums in 11 Russian cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ru.fifa.com/worldcup/organisation/volunteers/|title=Чемпионат мира по футболу FIFA 2018 в России™ - Волонтерская программа Чемпионата мира по футболу FIFA 2018 в России™ - FIFA.com|last=FIFA.com|work=www.fifa.com|access-date=2018-06-14|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The volunteer program of the 2018 FIFA World Cup has engaged thousands of people from Russia and other countries around the world.

The program included several stages: recruitment, selection and training of volunteers, organisation of their work during the championship. The recruitment of volunteers for the FIFA Confederations Cup and the FIFA World Cup via FIFA.com started on June 1, 2016 and closed on December 30, 2016. Some of the volunteers worked at the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]]: 1733 people assisted the organisers in Saint Petersburg, 1590 worked in Moscow, 1261 in Sochi, 1260 in Kazan, a total of 5844 participants.

The FIFA World Cup will be supported by 17,040 volunteers of the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee.

Candidates living in Russia were selected by 15 volunteer centres in the host cities based in some of Russia's leading higher educational institutions: Synergy University, Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, Russian State Social University, Moscow Automobile and Road Construction University, Saint Petersburg State University of Economics, Samara State University, Volga Region State Academy of Physical Culture, Sport and Tourism, Don State Technical University, Ogarev Mordovia State University, Volgograd State University, State University of Nizhny Novgorod, Samara State Aerospace University, Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, and Ural Federal University.

Candidates from other countries were selected remotely.

Candidates had to be at least 18 years old, have a good knowledge of English, have a higher or vocational secondary education, and possess teamwork skills.

Volunteers were trained remotely, in volunteer centres and at World Cup venues.

Volunteers will be providing assistance in a variety of areas:

# Distributing accreditations;
# Selling and checking tickets;
# Assisting radio communications professionals;
# Organising leisure and entertainment activities for guests of the event;
# Organising food outlets;
# Providing interpretation services;
# Working with sponsors;
# Providing medical services and organising doping control procedures;
# Supporting mass media operations;
# Organising arrivals and departures of players and guests;
# Working with VIP guests;
# Assisting players and referees;
# Assisting players and guests with accommodation;
# Providing navigation assistance to guests;
# Assisting TV and radio broadcasting;
# Organising transportation;
# Managing volunteers;
# Organising operations of the stadium;
# Monitoring compliance with FIFA social and environmental requirements;
# Organising the opening and closing ceremonies of the championship.

Their work started ahead of the events: on May 10, 2017 for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, and on May 10, 2018 for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

==== Legacy of 2018 FIFA World Cup Volunteer Program: Russian National Competition of Important Social Projects ====
On October 20, 2017, the Russian National Competition of Important Social Projects “Legacy of 2018 FIFA World Cup Volunteer Program” was launched. The competition has engaged about 1500 people: applicants to the 2018 FIFA World Cup volunteer program and future city volunteers.

The idea of the competition was that anyone could submit a project that would draw the attention of Russian cities residents to the FIFA World Cup in Russia and leave a legacy after the championship was over.

The project was expected to produce tangible (work of art, place of attraction for guests and residents in the city, open playground, graffiti, developed areas in city parks, films, etc.) or intangible (events, conferences, festivals, exhibitions) legacy.

26 projects qualified to the final and were supported by the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee and the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The jury included the General Director of the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee Alexey Sorokin, Ambassador of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia Alexey Smertin and Advisor to the Head of the Federal Tourism Agency Svetlana Sergeeva.

Some of the projects were combined or further developed by the Local Organising Committee.

Among the projects were: Football Championship for Moms, Ramp Production out of Recycled Plastic, Your Championship Sticker Packs, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ru.fifa.com/worldcup/news/%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%80%D1%81%D0%B0-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B8-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D1%8B-%D1%87%D0%BC-2018-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8B-2922854|title=Чемпионат мира по футболу FIFA 2018 в России™ - Новости - Победители конкурса «Наследие волонтерской программы ЧМ-2018» награждены в «Сколково» - FIFA.com|last=FIFA.com|work=www.fifa.com|access-date=2018-06-14|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political view==
{{Further information|Gift economy}}
Modern societies share a common value of people helping each other; not only do volunteer acts assist others, but they also benefit the volunteering individual on a personal level.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.picketnews.com/archiveDetail.asp?cID=3&amp;id=8327|publisher=Picket News&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having similar objectives, tension can arise between volunteers and state-provided services. In order to curtail this tension, most countries develop policies and enact legislation to clarify the roles and relationships among governmental stakeholders and their voluntary counterparts; this regulation identifies and allocates the necessary legal, social, administrative, and financial support of each party. This is particularly necessary when some voluntary activities are seen as a challenge to the authority of the state(e.g., on 29 January 2001, President Bush cautioned that volunteer groups should supplement—not replace—government agencies’ work).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policyalmanac.org/government/charity_and_volunteering.shtml Bush Announces Faith-Based Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt;

Volunteering that benefits the state but challenges paid counterparts angers labor unions that represent those who are paid for their volunteer work; this is particularly seen in combination departments, such as [[volunteer fire department]]s.

===Difficulties in cross-national aid===
{{see also|International volunteering}}
Difficulties in the cross-national aid model of volunteering can arise when it is applied across national borders. The presence of volunteers who are sent from one state to another can be viewed as a breach of [[sovereignty]] and showing a lack of respect towards the national government of the proposed recipients. Thus, motivations are important when states negotiate offers to send aid and when these proposals are accepted, particularly if donors may postpone assistance or stop it altogether. Three types of conditionality have evolved:
#'''Financial accountability''': Transparency in funding management to ensure that what is done by the volunteers is properly targeted
#'''Policy reform''': Governmental request that developing countries adopt certain social, economic, or environmental policies; often, the most controversial relate to the privatization of services traditionally offered by the state
#'''Development objectives''': Asking developing countries to adjust specific time-bound economic objectives

Some international volunteer organizations define their primary mission as being altruistic: to fight poverty and improve the living standards of people in the developing world, (e.g. [[Voluntary Services Overseas]] has almost 2,000 skilled professionals working as volunteers to pass on their expertise to local people so that the volunteers' skills remain long after they return home). When these organizations work in partnership with governments, the results can be impressive. However, when other organizations or individual First World governments support the work of volunteer groups, there can be questions as to whether the organizations' or governments' real motives are poverty alleviation. Instead, a focus on creating wealth for some of the poor or developing policies intended to benefit the donor states is sometimes reported.&lt;ref&gt;ISBN reference for Volunteering Visions, Publisher: The Federation Press, Edited by: [[Joy Noble]] and [[Fiona Johnston]], {{ISBN|1-86287-404-2}} {{ISBN|978-1862874046}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many low-income countries’ economies suffer from industrialization without prosperity and investment without growth. One reason for this is that development assistance guides many Third World governments to pursue development policies that have been wasteful, ill-conceived, or unproductive; some of these policies have been so destructive that the economies could not have been sustained without outside support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDS_IBank_Servlet?pcont=details&amp;eid=000009265_3980429111119|title=Aid, taxation, and development: analytical perspectives on aid effectiveness in Sub-Saharan Africa|publisher=World Bank|date=1998-02-28|accessdate=2007-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, some offers of aid have distorted the general spirit of volunteering, treating local voluntary action as contributions in kind, i.e., existing conditions requiring the modification of local people’s behavior in order for them to earn the right to donors’ charity. This can be seen as patronizing and offensive to the recipients because the aid expressly serves the policy aims of the donors rather than the needs of the recipients.

==Moral resources, political capital and civil society==
[[File:Some help files iin a volunteers station in Shenzhen,China .jpg|thumb|250px|right|Some files for helping people in a volunteers station in [[Shenzhen]], [[People's Republic of China]]]]
Based on a case study in China, Xu and Ngai (2011) revealed that the developing grassroots volunteerism can be an enclave among various organizations and may be able to work toward the development of civil society in the developing countries. The researchers developed a "Moral Resources and Political Capital" approach to examine the contributions of volunteerism in promoting the civil society. Moral resource means the available morals could be chosen by NGOs. Political capital means the capital that will improve or enhance the NGOs’ status, possession or access in the existing political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Xu |first1=Y |last2=Ngai |first2=N. P. |year=2011 |title= Moral Resources and Political Capital: Theorizing the Relationship Between Voluntary Service Organizations and the Development of Civil Society in China |work=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=247–269.|accessdate=17 April 2011 |url= http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/40/2/247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Xu and Ngai (2011) distinguished two types of Moral Resources: Moral Resource-I and Moral Resource-II (ibid).
#Moral Resource I: Inspired by [[Immanuel Kant]]’s (1998 [1787]) argument of "What ought I to do," Moral Resource-I will encourage the NGOs’ confidence and then have the courage to act and conquer difficulties by way of answering and confirming the question of "What ought I to do."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, I. (1998). Critique of pure reason ([[J. M. D. Meiklejohn]], Trans.). Raleigh, NC: Alex Catalogue.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Moral Resource II: given that Adorno (2000) recognizes that moral or immoral tropes are socially determined, Moral Resource-II refers to the morals that are well accepted by the given society.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, T. (2000). Problems of moral philosophy (T. Schroder, Ed. &amp; R. Livingstone, Trans.). Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to the intellectual heritage of Blau and Duncan (1967), two types of political capital were identified:
#Political Capital-I refers to the political capital mainly ascribed to the status that the NGO inherited throughout history (e.g., the CYL).
#Political Capital-II refers to the Political Capital that the NGOs earned through their hard efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Blau, P. M., &amp; Duncan, O. D. (1967). The American occupational structure. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;
Obviously, "Moral resource-I itself contains the self-determination that gives participants confidence in the ethical beliefs they have chosen",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Xu |first1=Y |last2=Ngai |first2=N. P. |year=2011 |title= Moral Resources and Political Capital: Theorizing the Relationship Between Voluntary Service Organizations and the Development of Civil Society in China |work=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly |volume=40 |issue=2 |page=260 |accessdate=17 April 2011 |url=http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/40/2/247.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; almost any organizations may have Moral Resource-I, while not all of them have the societal recognized Moral Resource-II. However, the voluntary service organizations predominantly occupy Moral Resource-II because a sense of moral superiority makes it possible that for parties with different values, goals and cultures to work together in promoting the promotion of volunteering. Thus the voluntary service organizations are likely to win the trust and support of the masses as well as the government more easily than will the organizations whose morals are not accepted by mainstream society. In other words, Moral Resource II helps the grassroots organizations with little Political Capital I to win Political Capital-II, which is a crucial factor for their survival and growth in developing countries such as China. Therefore, the voluntary service realm could be an enclave of the development of civil society in the developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Xu |first1=Y. |last2= Ngai |first2=N. P. |year=2011 |title= Moral Resources and Political Capital: Theorizing the Relationship Between Voluntary Service Organizations and the Development of Civil Society in China |work=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=247–269 |accessdate=17 April 2011 |url=http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/40/2/247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health benefits==
Volunteering has the ability to improve the quality of life and health including longevity of those who donate their time &lt;ref&gt;https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/Post-AltruismHappinessHealth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and research has found that older adults will benefit the most from volunteering. Physical and mental ailments plaguing older adults can be healed through the simple act of helping others; however, one must be performing the good deed from a selfless nature. There are barriers that can prevent older adults from participating in volunteer work, such as socio-economic status, opinions held by others, and even current health issues. However, these barriers can be overcome so that if one would like to be involved in volunteer work they can do so. Volunteering improves not only the communities in which one serves, but also the life of the individual who is providing help to the community.

==Mental health benefits==
Volunteering is known not only to be related to happiness &lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228189802_Prosocial_Spending_and_Well-Being_Cross-Cultural_Evidence_for_a_Psychological_Universal&lt;/ref&gt; but also to increase happiness &lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228189802_Prosocial_Spending_and_Well-Being_Cross-Cultural_Evidence_for_a_Psychological_Universal&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5494996_Spending_Money_on_Others_Promotes_Happiness
&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, giving help was a more important benefit of better reported mental health than receiving help &lt;ref&gt;http://img2.timg.co.il/forums/1_89494618.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Studies have also shown that volunteering can cause a decrease in  loneliness for those volunteering as well as those for whom people volunteer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.drbarbaraedwards.com/why-helping-others-makes-us-happy/|title=Why Helping Others Makes Us Happy {{!}} Dr. Barbara Edwards|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
In the United States, statistics on volunteering have historically been limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energizeinc.com/hot-topics/2006/june|title=Wouldn't It Be Nice to Really Know {{!}} Energize: Volunteer Management Resources for Directors of Volunteers|website=www.energizeinc.com|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the U.S. [[Current Population Survey (US)]] included a volunteering supplement which produced statistics on volunteering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.volunteeringinamerica.gov/about/research_faqs.cfm|title=National Veteran Corps|website=www.volunteeringinamerica.gov|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
In the 1960s, [[Ivan Illich]] offered an analysis of the role of American volunteers in Mexico in his speech entitled "To Hell With Good Intentions". His concerns, along with those of critics such as [[Paulo Freire]] and [[Edward Said]], revolve around the notion of [[altruism]] as an extension of Christian [[missionary]] [[ideology]]. In addition, he mentions the sense of [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]]/[[obligation]] as a factor, which drives the concept of [[noblesse oblige]]—first developed by the French [[aristocracy]] as a [[morality|moral]] [[duty]] derived from their wealth. Simply stated, these apprehensions propose the extension of power and authority over indigenous cultures around the world. Recent critiques of volunteering come from Westmier and Kahn (1996) and [[bell hooks]] (née Gloria Watkins) (2004). Also, [http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415809153/ Georgeou (2012)] has critiqued the impact of [[neoliberalism]] on international aid volunteering.

The field of the [[medical tourism]] (referring to volunteers who travel overseas to deliver medical care) has recently attracted negative criticism when compared to the alternative notion of sustainable capacities, i.e., work done in the context of long-term, locally-run, and foreign-supported infrastructures.  A preponderance of this criticism appears largely in scientific and peer-reviewed literature.&lt;ref&gt;Bezruchka, S. (2000). Medical Tourism as Medical Harm to the Third World: Why? For Whom? ''[[Wilderness and Environmental Medicine]]'', 11, 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, M. (2006). Duffle Bag Medicine. ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'', 295, 1491-1492.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinto, A.D., &amp; Upshur, R.E.G. (2009). Global Health Ethics for Students. ''[[Developing World Bioethics]]'', 9, 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, media outlets with more general readerships have published such criticisms as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/think-looking-after-turtles-in-costa-rica-for-three-weeks-is-good-for-your-cv-think-again-66148#comment_1125331|title=Think looking after turtles in Costa Rica for three weeks is good for your CV?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5087">The '''West African Youth League''' (WAYL) was a [[political organisation]] founded by [[I. T. A. Wallace-Johnson]] in June 1935.&lt;ref name="SD1973p432"&gt;{{Harvnb|Spitzer|Denzer|1973a|p=432}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The group was a major political force against the colonial government in [[West Africa]], especially in the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. The League was the first political movement in the region "to recruit women into the main membership and the decision-making bodies of the organisation".&lt;ref&gt;Murray Last, [[Paul Richards (anthropology)|Paul Richards]]; [[Christopher Fyfe]] (eds), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=N3joAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA443&amp;lpg=PA443&amp;dq=edna+elliott+horton&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=exG-fRhhlY&amp;sig=CZE6pfeyJt8XPlh0MAy4rYza9zU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wqufVbTGMIHiUZD1kdgL&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=edna%20elliott%20horton&amp;f=false ''Sierra Leone, 1787-1987: Two Centuries of Intellectual Life''] (special edition of ''[[Africa (journal)|Africa]]'', journal of the [[International African Institute]], Vol. 57, No. 4), [[Manchester University Press]], 1987, p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 the popularity of the League increased in Sierra Leone as Wallace-Johnson returned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iss.co.za/af/profiles/SieraLeone/Politics.html Sierra Leone - History and Politics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The league contested and won the [[Freetown]] City Council elections in the same year. At the time Wallace-Johnson claimed that the organisation had a membership of 40 000. Following the Freetown election victory, the British authorities arrested Wallace-Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanews.com/site/list_messages/16944 AfricaNews - Wallace Johnson's legacy still thrives - Chernoh&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The league went into disarray after Wallace-Johnson was sent to prison on [[Sherbro Island]] in 1939. After attempting to revive the organisation in 1944, Wallace-Johnson took it into the [[Pan-African Federation]] set up in [[Manchester]], [[United Kingdom]]. He decided to merge it into the [[National Council of Sierra Leone]] in 1950.

[[Mary Lokko]] served as Wallace-Johnson's assistant for a time beginning in 1936, becoming likely the first woman in [[West Africa]] to hold a position in a political organization.&lt;ref name="Sheldon2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathleen E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32340">'''Workplace aggression''' is a specific type of [[aggression]] which occurs in the workplace. Workplace aggression can include a wide range of behaviors, ranging from verbal acts (e.g., insulting someone or spreading rumors) to physical attacks (e.g., punching or slapping).

==Definition==
Aggression, in general, is any behavior an individual carries out with the intent to harm another person or group of people. The aggressor must believe that their behavior is harmful to their target, and that the target is motivated to avoid this behavior.&lt;ref name=andersonbushman02&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=CA |last2= Bushman |first2=BJ |title=Human aggression |journal=Annu Rev Psychol |volume=53 |issue= |pages=27–51 |year=2002 |pmid=11752478 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135231 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A defining feature of aggression is the intent or motivation to harm. For a behavior to be considered an aggressive act, the individual committing the behavior must intend harm. In other words, if they inflict harm on another without that specific intent, it is not considered aggression.&lt;ref name=andersonbushman02/&gt;

Aggression can occur in a variety of situations. One important domain to understand aggression is in the workplace. Workplace aggression is considered a specific type of [[counterproductive work behavior]] (CWB) and is defined as "any act of aggression, physical assault, threatening or coercive behavior that causes physical or emotional harm in a work setting."&lt;ref name=rai02&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rai | first1 = S. | year = 2002 | title = Preventing workplace aggression and violence—A role for occupational therapy | url = | journal = Journal of Prevention, Assessment, and Rehabilitation | volume = 18 | issue = 15–22| pages = 15–22 |pmid=12441587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers specify that workplace aggression only includes efforts to harm coworkers, former coworkers, current employers, or past employers.&lt;ref name=neumanbaron98/&gt; Others include in workplace aggression any behaviors intended to harm another person that are enacted in a workplace.&lt;ref name=peekasarunyanzwerling01&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0749-3797(00)00290-7 | last1 = Peek-Asa | first1 = C. | last2 = Runyan | first2 = C.W. | last3 = Zwerling | first3 = C. | year = 2001 | title = The role of surveillance and evaluation research in the reduction of violence against workers | url = | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 141–148 | pmid = 11165457 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
To delineate the range of behaviors that can be considered aggressive workplace behaviors, researchers have developed schemes of classification for workplace aggression. Neuman and Baron (1998) offer these three dimensions that encompass the range of workplace aggression:
# Expressions of hostility – behaviors that are primarily verbal or symbolic in nature
# [[Obstructionism]] – behaviors intended to hinder an employee from performing their job or the organization from accomplishing its objectives
# Overt aggression – violent acts

In an attempt to further break down the wide range of aggressive workplace behaviors, Baron and Neuman (1996) also classify workplace aggression based on these three dichotomies:
# Verbal–physical
# Direct–indirect
# Active–passive&lt;ref name=baronneuman96&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2337(1996)22:3&lt;161::AID-AB1&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q | last1 = Baron | first1 = R.A. | last2 = Neuman | first2 = J.H. | year = 1996 | title = Workplace violence and workplace aggression: Evidence of their relative frequency and potential causes | url = | journal = Aggressive Behavior | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 161–173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggressive acts can take any possible combination of these three dichotomies. For example, failing to deny false rumors about a coworker would be classified as verbal–passive–indirect. Purposely avoiding the presence of a coworker you know is searching for your assistance could be considered physical–passive–direct.

Other researchers offer a classification system based on the aggressor's relationship to the victim.&lt;ref name=peekasarunyanzwerling01/&gt;
# Criminal intent (Type I) – this type of aggression occurs when the aggressor has no relationship to the victim or organization.
# Customer/client (Type II) – the aggressor has a relationship with the organization and aggresses while they are being served as a customer.
# Worker on worker (Type III) – both the aggressor and the victim are employees in the same organization. Often, the aggressor is a supervisor, and the victim is a subordinate.
# Personal relationship (Type IV) – the aggressor has a relationship with an employee at an organization, but not the organization itself. This category includes victims who are assaulted by a domestic partner while at work.

==Covert nature==
In the workplace much of the aggressive behavior enacted on targets are considered covert in nature. According to Bjorkqvist, Osterman, and Hjelt-Back, covert behaviors are those behaviors that are designed to disguise the aggressive behavior or aggressive intentions from the target. Overt aggression, on the other hand, includes behaviors that do not hide the aggressive intent and are open in their intentions. Typically, covert aggression is verbal, indirect, and passive in nature, while overt aggression reflects the physical, direct, and active side of the dichotomies.&lt;ref name=bjorkqvist94&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/1098-2337(1994)20:3&lt;173::AID-AB2480200304&gt;3.0.CO;2-D | last1 = Bjorkqvist | first1 = K. | last2 = Osterman | first2 = K. | last3 = Hjelt-Back | first3 = M. | year = 1994 | title = Aggression among university employees | url = | journal = Aggressive Behavior | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 173–184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workplace aggression often takes the form of covert behaviors. This can be attributed to what Bjorkqvist, Osterman, and Lagerspetz call the effect/danger ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/1098-2337(1994)20:1&lt;27::AID-AB2480200105&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q | last1 = Bjorkqvist | first1 = K. | last2 = Osterman | first2 = K. | last3 = Lagerspetz | first3 = K. J. | year = 1994 | title = Sex different in covert aggression among adults | url = | journal = Aggressive Behavior | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 27–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This term refers to the aggressors' subjective evaluation of the relative effects and danger of committing an aggressive act. For an aggressor, it is ideal to have a larger effect/danger ratio. In other words, aggressors want an act to have a large effect with relatively low risk of danger to themselves.

Individuals in the workplace are subjected to prolonged exposure to each other. This prolonged exposure means the victims of the aggressors' actions likely have more time to retaliate, thus increasing the danger aspect of the ratio. Also, workplaces are often communal in nature. That is, people often work in groups and are surrounded by others. The presence of others acts as a built in audience that could "punish" the aggressor for harming a victim. It is for these reasons that individuals often choose covert forms of aggression.&lt;ref name=baronneuman96/&gt;

==Predictors (antecedents)==
Predictors of workplace aggression can occur at both the organizational level and the individual level. Organizational factors examined here include [[organizational justice]], supervision and surveillance, changes in the work environment, and specific job characteristics. At the individual level, gender, age, and alcohol consumption are examined here. While this is not a comprehensive listing of predictors, it does cover the majority of workplace aggression predictors addressed in the empirical literature.

===Organizational (in)justice===
{{Main|Organizational justice}}
Perceived interpersonal justice, the degree to which people feel they are treated with fairness and respect, is negatively related to both psychological and physical aggression against supervisors.&lt;ref name= duprebarling06&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/1076-8998.11.1.13 | last1 = Dupre | first1 = K.E. | last2 = Barling | first2 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Predicting and preventing supervisory workplace aggression | url = | journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 13–26 | pmid = 16551171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inness, Barling, and Turner found similar results;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.90.4.731 | last1 = Inness | first1 = M. | last2 = Barling | first2 = J. | last3 = Turner | first3 = N. | year = 2005 | title = Understanding Supervisor-targeted aggression: A within-person, between-jobs design | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 90 | issue = 4| pages = 731–739 | pmid = 16060789 }}&lt;/ref&gt; perceived interpersonal injustice was related to workplace aggression in participants' primary and secondary jobs.

Moreover, perceived procedural justice, the extent to which formal organizational procedures are assumed fair, is related to workplace aggression against supervisors. Greenberg and Barling found that the greater the perceptions of procedural justice, the less workplace aggression was reported.&lt;ref name=greenbergbarling99/&gt;

=== Termination and job security ===
The most extreme forms of workplace aggression may result from personnel decisions, such as individual termination and mass layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Perceptions and Punishments of Workplace Aggression: The Role of Aggression Content, Context, and Perceiver Variables1|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0021-9029.2006.00115.x/abstract|journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date = 2006-10-01|issn = 1559-1816|pages = 2509–2531|volume = 36|issue = 10|doi = 10.1111/j.0021-9029.2006.00115.x|first = Theresa J.|last = Brown|first2 = Kenneth E.|last2 = Sumner}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 a man killed one and wounded five others at his former place of employment two years after he was let go from the company due to poor performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Suspect in Orlando shooting spree charged with first-degree murder  - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/11/06/orlando.shootings/index.html?eref=onion|accessdate = 2015-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar event occurred in 2012 when a man shot and killed four employees and then himself after losing his job earlier that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Suspect in Minneapolis shooting spree was laid-off employee|url = http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/28/14133671-suspect-in-minneapolis-shooting-spree-was-laid-off-employee?lite|accessdate = 2015-07-19|first = U.S.|last = News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Layoff|Downsizing]] is a tactic used by organizations where there is a slow-down in business in order to remain profitable or minimize losses. This tactic is most commonly observed during widespread economic hardships, such as the [[2008 recession|Great Recession]] of 2008.

Perceived [[Job security|job insecurity]], or feelings of impending termination, has been found to be a predictor of workplace aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Incivility and Workplace Violence {{!}} Civility Toolbox {{!}} Show Me Respect: Promoting Civility at the University of Missouri|url = http://civility.missouri.edu/incivility-workplace-violence.php|website = civility.missouri.edu|accessdate = 2015-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supervision and surveillance===
Workplace surveillance ([[employee monitoring]]) is positively related to workplace aggression against supervisors, such that the greater the number of employee surveillance methods used, the greater the amount of workplace aggression.&lt;ref name=greenbergbarling99/&gt; Furthermore, supervisory control over work performance has also been shown positively related to workplace aggression against supervisors.&lt;ref name= duprebarling06/&gt; This type of behavior has been observed both adults and teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Workplace aggression in teenage part-time employees.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.987|journal = Journal of Applied Psychology|date = 2006-01-01|volume = 91|issue = 5|doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.987|first = Kathryne E.|last = Dupré|first2 = Michelle|last2 = Inness|first3 = Catherine E.|last3 = Connelly|first4 = Julian|last4 = Barling|first5 = Colette|last5 = Hoption|pages=987–997|pmid=16953763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workplace changes===
Baron and Neuman found that certain changes in the work environment can lead to increased aggression that they attribute to heightened anxiety and stress.&lt;ref name=baronneuman96/&gt; Specifically, pay cuts or freezes, changes in management, increased monitoring systems (e.g., increased computer monitoring), increased diversity, and the increased use of part-time employees all were related to higher levels of workplace aggression.

===Job-specific characteristics===
Other antecedents of workplace aggression found in the literature are specific job characteristics. LeBlanc and Kelloway found that certain job features, such as handling guns or collecting valuable items, were significantly more related to workplace aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.87.3.444 | last1 = LeBlanc | first1 = M.M. | last2 = Kelloway | first2 = E.K. | year = 2002 | title = Predictors and outcomes of workplace violence and aggression | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 87 | issue = 3| pages = 444–453 | pmid = 12090602 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time spent at work===
Harvey and Keashly found that length of time at work was able to predict workplace aggression such that the longer hours a person worked, the more likely they were to report aggression. The authors attributed this finding to two possible reasons. First, the more hours worked, the greater statistical probability of being victimized. Second, longer hours worked could contribute to fatigue and frustration. This in turn may increase the likelihood of aggressive actions towards coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2224/sbp.2003.31.8.807 | last1 = Harvey | first1 = S. | last2 = Keashly | first2 = L. | year = 2003 | title = Predicting the risk for aggression in the workplace: Risk factors, self-esteem, and time at work | url = | journal = Social Behavior and Personality | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 807–814 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===
In some studies, gender has been shown a significant predictor of workplace aggression. For example, being male is significantly related to reports of aggression against supervisors.&lt;ref name= duprebarling06/&gt; Furthermore, males are more likely to commit aggressive acts in the presence of other men.&lt;ref name=kaukiainenetal&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ab.1021 | last1 = Kaukiainen | first1 = A. | last2 = Salmivalli | first2 = C. | last3 = Bjorkqvist | first3 = K. | last4 = Osterman | first4 = K. | last5 = Lahtinen | first5 = A. | last6 = Kostomo | first6 = A. | last7 = Lagerspetz | first7 = K. | year = 2001 | title = Overt and covert aggression in work settings in relation to the subjective well-being of employees | url = | journal = Aggressive Behavior | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 360–371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be attributed to societal cultures that dictate "codes of honor." Females, on the other hand, are no more likely to act aggressively in either the presence of females or males.

===Age===
Age is significantly related to aggression. In their study of age and [[job performance]], Ng and Feldman found that older workers (age 40 or older) engaged in less workplace aggression than younger workers.&lt;ref name=ngfeldman08&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.93.2.392 | last1 = Ng | first1 = T.W.H. | last2 = Feldman | first2 = D.C. | year = 2008 | title = The relationship of age to ten dimensions of job performance | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 93 | issue = 2| pages = 392–423 | pmid = 18361640 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol consumption===
The frequency and amount of alcohol typically consumed by a person predicts aggressive behavior. Those who consume more alcohol more frequently are more likely to aggress against a coworker.&lt;ref name= greenbergbarling99&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1379(199911)20:6&lt;897::AID-JOB975&gt;3.0.CO;2-Z | last1 = Greenberg | first1 = L. | last2 = Barling | first2 = J. | year = 1999 | title = Predicting employee aggression against coworkers, subordinates and supervisors: The roles of person behaviors and perceived workplace factors | url = | journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 897–913 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hebei tractor rampage]] began as workplace aggression following alcohol consumption.&lt;ref name="154 per 100"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article548063.ece |title=China coal worker kills 11 in drunken rampage with tractor |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=August 2, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyber-aggression==
'''Cyber-aggression''' or [[Harassment by computer|cyber-harassment]]:

    {{Quote|text=Takes the form of obscene or hate e-mail/text messages that threaten or frighten, or e-mails/text messages that contain offensive content, such as sexist or racist material. What is unique about this type of workplace harassment, compared to more traditional forms of harassment, is that this material can be sent by people in addition to work colleagues, by other individuals outside the workplace (either known or not known to the person) or even in the form of spam. |author=Whitty &amp; Carr |source=&lt;ref name="Whitty_Carr04"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whitty | first1 = Monica T. | last2 = Carr | first2 = Adrian N. | year = 2004 | title = New rules in the workplace: Applying object-relations theory to explain problem Internet and email behaviour in the workplace | doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2004.06.005 | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 235–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

What many do not realize that the phenomenon of cyber-bullying often associated with teenage culture has spread to the workplace in a variety of ways. While this trend is seemingly silent and slow growing, its effects are considered equally hurtful as any form of harassment.

Often, cyber-aggression is the result of individuals in a workplace being offended/upset/or feeling threatened by organizational problems. They then resort to virtual communication as a form of retaliation. These actions are referred to as ''[[Flaming (Internet)|flaming]]'' by Whitty &amp; Carr, or essentially when an individual online writes with hostility towards a particular person or group of people.

===Instant messaging===
Instant messaging has become both a help and a hindrance in organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Greengard, Samuel. "IM speeds workplace communication, but it can also spell trouble." ''Workforce Management'' July 2003: 84-85&lt;/ref&gt; The ease of use with instant messaging, is partially to blame, "Employees can see who else is available, and if it’s someone they want to talk to, they’re able to connect in real time". While this has become an extremely useful tool in workplace communication, instant messengers such at AIM or MSN Messenger are not easily regulated from a managerial aspect, which leads to employees being able to have private conversations on a public platform. These conversations can foster aggressive talk and lead to potentially hurtful information being spread among an organization. Some argue that instant messages are beneficial to the work process because it can easily resolve problems without having to distract the person via phone and you don’t have to wait for an email response.

===Email===
This is one of the most prevalent tools used in cyber-aggression because of its prevalence in workplace communications.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, Hoda. ""E" is for etiquette when sending emails." ''Travel Trade Gazette'' 13 May 2005: 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Claire. "Want to tell a lie? Put it in email." ''The Times Higher Education Supplement'' 20 Jan. 2007: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Often upset workers send loaded messages and attach the email to a large group of co-workers that are not involved in the issue to bring attention to it. An article from the Travel Trade Gazette give some advice to avoid being aggressive in emails.
* Always give a clear subject
* State exactly what you need in a simple manner
* Avoid terms like ''[[wikt:ASAP|ASAP]]''
* Only use reply all when it refers to the whole group
* Using all upper case is electronic SHOUTING!
* Don’t use texting lexicon
* Never send an email when you are upset

===Social networking===
This is one of the fastest growing ways that workers can lash out against each other. The opportunity is high for individuals to be aggressive in a highly public and open forum. Many choose to speak out at their co-workers or superiors because it is a way for them to vent their feelings while not having to say these things face to face.

==Outcomes==
Like the array of behaviors considered workplace aggression, the consequences of workplace aggression are also extensive. For example, Ng and Feldman suggest that "acts of workplace aggression can cause bodily harm to employees, pose physical danger for customers, create public relations crises, and harm the business reputation of the firm as a whole."&lt;ref name=ngfeldman08/&gt; The outcomes of workplace aggression addressed here include the health and well-being of targeted employees and job performance. Gender differences in outcomes are also addressed.

Severity of the repercussions may be influenced by the position of the aggressor. Hershcovis and Barling found that "...supervisor aggression has the strongest adverse effects across attitudinal and behavioral outcomes", followed by co-worker aggression and outsider aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Towards a multi-foci approach to workplace aggression: A meta-analytic review of outcomes from different perpetrators|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/job.621/abstract|journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior|date = 2010-01-01|issn = 1099-1379|pages = 24–44|volume = 31|issue = 1|doi = 10.1002/job.621|first = M. Sandy|last = Hershcovis|first2 = Julian|last2 = Barling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health and well-being===
Workplace aggression can have devastating effects on an organization's employees.&lt;ref name=baronneuman96/&gt; For example, it has been found that targets of workplace aggression report lower levels of [[well-being]].&lt;ref name=baronneuman96/&gt; Other studies have shown that aggression in the workplace can cause the victims of such behaviors to suffer from health problems and displaced aggression - including perpetuating aggression towards random strangers in the street. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/1061-4087.47.4.205 | last1 = Driscoll | first1 = R. | last2 = Worthington | first2 = K. | last3 = Hurrell | first3 = J.J. | year = 1995 | title = Workplace assault: An emerging job stressor | url = | journal = Consult Psychological Practical Research | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 205–211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bjorkqvist, Osterman, and Hjelt-Back even found that targets exhibited symptoms similar to those of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), such as anxiety and depression.&lt;ref name=bjorkqvist94/&gt; . Sorensen et al. found possible associations between harassment at work and well-being measures of [[low back pain|lower back pain]] and [[sleep deprivation|sleep deficiency]] among a sample of hospital workers.&lt;ref name=sorensen&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sorensen | first1 = G. | last2 = Stoddard | first2 = A.M. | last3 = Stoffel | first3 = S. | last4 = Buxton | first4 = O. | last5 = Sembajwe | first5 = G. | last6 = Hashimoto | first6 = D.| last7 = Dennerlein | first7 = J.T. | last8 = Hopcia | first8 = K. | year = 2011 | title = The Role of the Work Context in Multiple Wellness Outcomes for Hospital Patient Care Workers | journal = Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine | volume = 53 | issue = 8 | pages = 899–910 | pmid=21775897 | doi=10.1097/JOM.0b013e318226a74a | pmc=3693572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Team performance===
Research has looked at the negative impacts of workplace aggression on team performance and particularly team effectiveness as was evidenced in a recent study by Aube and Rousseau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rousseau | first1 = V. | last2 = Aube | first2 = C. | year = 2011 | title = Interpersonal aggression and team effectiveness: The mediating role of team goal commitment | url = | journal = Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology | volume = 84 | issue = 3| pages = 565–580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Job satisfaction===
Victims of workplace aggression may suffer from reduced [[job satisfaction]]. Lapierre, Spector, and Leck found that those who perceived being targets of workplace aggression reported significantly lower overall job satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/1076-8998.10.2.155 | last1 = Lapierre | first1 = L.M. | last2 = Spector | first2 = P.E. | last3 = Leck | first3 = J.D. | year = 2005 | title = Sexual versus nonsexual workplace aggression and victims' overall job satisfaction: A meta-analysis | url = | journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 155–169 | pmid = 15826225 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, those who perceive abuse from their supervisors report lower levels of job satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1556375 | last1 = Tepper | first1 = B.J. | year = 2000 | title = Consequences of abusive supervision | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 178–190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender differences in outcomes===
Research has shown that males and females react to workplace aggression differently. While both males and females have reported lower well-being after experiencing aggression in the workplace, studies indicate that the relationship between experienced workplace aggression and decreased well-being was stronger for men. In one study, results showed that men who experienced work aggression were more likely to report physical, psychosocial, affective, and cognitive problems. This study also showed that the type of aggression, whether it is overt or covert, did not matter for these outcomes.&lt;ref name= kaukiainenetal/&gt; The study attributes these findings to the idea of modern-day masculinity, which stresses achievement and success in the workplace.

For females, nonsexual aggression has been found to have a stronger impact on job satisfaction than sexual aggression. Also, nonsexual aggression has a stronger relationship with job satisfaction in females than in males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sexual Versus Nonsexual Workplace Aggression and Victims' Overall Job Satisfaction: A Meta-Analysis.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/1076-8998.10.2.155|journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|date = 2005-01-01|volume = 10|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/1076-8998.10.2.155|first = Laurent M.|last = Lapierre|first2 = Paul E.|last2 = Spector|first3 = Joanne D.|last3 = Leck|pmid=15826225|pages=155–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Prevention programs focus on reducing instances of workplace aggression. Programs that incorporate personnel selection, organizational sanctions, and training are recommended.

===Personnel selection===
Based on a workplace prevention program developed by the United States Postal Service (USPS), Neuman and Baron encourage organizations to use personnel screening and testing to identify potential employees who are likely to behave aggressively before they are even hired. This proactive strategy prevents individuals who are predisposed to aggress from even entering the workplace.&lt;ref name=neumanbaron98/&gt;

===Organizational sanctions===
Explicit policies regarding workplace aggression may help organizations to reduce aggression. Employees who perceived that their organization would punish workplace aggressors reported less workplace aggression even when their perceptions of interpersonal justice were high.&lt;ref name="duprebarling06"/&gt; Neuman and Baron also suggest using organizational policies to curb workplace aggression and to shape strong anti-aggressive organizational norms.&lt;ref name=neumanbaron98/&gt;

===Training===
[[Training]] is also an important part of a prevention program. Neuman and Baron suggest that training for both supervisors and subordinates should focus on teaching employees methods for dealing with aggression.&lt;ref name=neumanbaron98&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neuman | first1 = J.H. | last2 = Baron | first2 = R.A. | year = 1998 | title = Workplace violence and workplace aggression: Evidence concerning specific forms, potential causes, and preferred targets | url = | journal = Journal of Management | volume = 24 | issue =3 | pages = 391–419 |doi=10.1177/014920639802400305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Rai advises that appropriate training should inform employees that management takes threats seriously, encourage employees to report incidents, and demonstrate management's commitment to deal with reported incidents.&lt;ref name=rai02/&gt;

=== Organizational support ===
Organizational support can influence the effects of workplace aggression. Schat and Kelloway isolated two forms of organizational support: instrumental and informational. Instrumental support refers to providing some type of assistance directly to an afflicted individuals, whereas information support refers to providing employees with self-help informational resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Reducing the adverse consequences of workplace aggression and violence: The buffering effects of organizational support.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/1076-8998.8.2.110|journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|date = 2003-01-01|volume = 8|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/1076-8998.8.2.110|first = Aaron C.

The '''''Zeitgeist''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|aɪ|t|ɡ|aɪ|s|t}},&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/zeitgeist oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[German language|German]] pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|s|aɪ|t|ɡ|aɪ|s|t}} {{Audio|De-zeitgeist.ogg|Zeitgeist}}) is a concept from 18th- to 19th-century [[German philosophy]], translated as "spirit of the age" or "spirit of the times". It refers to an invisible agent or force dominating the characteristics of a given epoch in [[world history]].&lt;ref&gt;Theo Jung: [https://freidok.uni-freiburg.de/data/9343 "Zeitgeist im langen 18. Jahrhundert. Dimensionen eines umstrittenen Begriffs"], in: Achim Landwehr (ed.): ''Frühe Neue Zeiten. Zeitwissen zwischen Reformation und Revolution'', Bielefeld 2012, 319-355; idem: [https://freidok.uni-freiburg.de/data/10824 "The Politics of Time: Zeitgeist in Early Nineteenth-Century Political Discourse"], in: Contributions to the History of Concepts 9, Nr. 1 (2014), 24-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is now mostly associated with [[Hegel]], contrasting with Hegel's use of ''[[Volksgeist]]'' "national spirit" and ''[[Weltgeist]]'' "world-spirit", 
but its coinage and popularization precedes Hegel, and is mostly due to [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;''Zeitgeist'' "spirit of the epoch" and ''Nationalgeist'' "spirit of a nation" in L. Meister, ''Eine kurze Geschichte der Menschenrechte'' (1789).
''der frivole Welt- und Zeitgeist'' ("the frivolous spirit of the world and the time") in [[Lavater]], ''Handbibliothek für Freunde'' 5 (1791), p. 57.
''Zeitgeist'' is popularized by [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Goethe]].
[http://woerterbuchnetz.de/cgi-bin/WBNetz/wbgui_py?sigle=DWB&amp;mode=Vernetzung&amp;hitlist=&amp;patternlist=&amp;lemid=GZ03558#XGZ03567 Zeitgeist] in Grimm, ''Deutsches Wörterbuch''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other philosophers who were associated with such ideas include [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]]{{year needed|date=March 2018}} and [[Voltaire]]{{year needed|date=March 2018}}.&lt;ref name="StF" /&gt;&lt;!--are we claiming Voltaire used the German word, or is this implicitly translating ''esprit du temps''? reference? year?--&gt; 

Contemporary use of the term may, more pragmatically, refer to a schema of [[fad|fashions or fads]] which prescribes what is considered to be acceptable or tasteful for an era, e.g. in the field of [[architecture]].&lt;ref name=StF&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yvqZt9ZnmYUC&amp;printsec=frontcover |author=Eero Saarinen |title=Shaping the Future |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-972-48812-9 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yvqZt9ZnmYUC&amp;pg=PA15 15]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hegel==
{{see|Phenomenology of the Spirit|Weltgeist|Volksgeist|Hegelianism}}
Hegel in ''[[Phenomenology of the Spirit]]'' (1807) uses both ''Weltgeist'' and ''Volksgeist'' but prefers the phrase ''Geist der Zeiten'' "spirit of the times" over the [[German compound|compound]] ''Zeitgeist''.&lt;ref&gt;
c.f. use of the phrase {{lang|de|der Geist seiner Zeit}} ("the spirit of his time") in  ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]'', for example, "no man can surpass his own time, for the spirit of his time is also his own spirit." {{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khvwPJMzNzMC&amp;printsec=frontcover |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=khvwPJMzNzMC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=Zeitgeist |title=The Hegel Dictionary |author=Glenn Alexander Magee |publisher=[[A &amp; C Black]] |location=London |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-847-06591-9 &lt;!--|ISBN=1-84706591-0 --&gt;|chapter=Zeitgeist (p. 262)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hegelian concept does not necessarily contrast with the [[Great Man theory]] as by [[Thomas Carlyle]], which sees history as the result of the actions of heroes and geniuses, as Hegel perceived such "great men", specifically [[Napoleon]], as the "embodiment of the world-spirit" (''Die Weltseele zu Pferde'' "the world-soul on horseback"&lt;ref&gt; Hegel, letter of  13 October 1806  to F. I. Niethammer,  no. 74 (p. 119) in ''Briefe von und an Hegel'' ed. Hoffmeister, vol. 1 (1970). 
See also H. Schnädelbach in Wolfgang Welsch, Klaus Vieweg (eds.), ''Das Interesse des Denkens: Hegel aus heutiger Sicht'', 
Wilhelm Fink Verlag (2003), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=NrkPdUO5VRsC&amp;pg=PA233  p. 223], 
T. Pinkard, '' Hegel: A Biography'', (2000), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Hegel believed that art reflected, by its very nature, the culture of the time in which it is created. Culture and art are inextricable because an individual artist is a product of his or her time and therefore brings that culture to any given work of art. Furthermore, he believed that in the modern world it was impossible to produce classical art, which he believed represented a "free and ethical culture", which depended more on the [[Aesthetics|philosophy of art]] and [[Art#Art theories|theory of art]], rather than a reflection of the social construct, or ''Zeitgeist'' in which a given artist lives.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrix, John Shannon. ''Aesthetics &amp; The Philosophy Of Spirit''. New York: Peter Lang. (2005). 4, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In self-help and business models==
{{undue|date=March 2018}}
===Theory of leadership===
A "zeitgeist theory of [[leadership]]" has been  contrasted with [[Thomas Carlyle|Thomas Carlyle’s]] [[great man theory]] by Forsyth (2009).&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2009"&gt;Forsyth, D. R. (2009). Group dynamics: New York: Wadsworth. [Chapter 9]&lt;/ref&gt; In his theory, Carlyle stresses that leaders do not become leaders by fate or accident. Instead, these individuals possess characteristics of great leaders and these characteristics allow them to obtain positions of power.

According to Forsyth,  [[Leo Tolstoy]] disagreed with Carlyle’s perspective, 
instead believing that leadership, like other things,  was a product of the "zeitgeist",{{year needed|date=March 2018}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;!--are we claiming Tolstoy used the term (when? where?) or are we just saying that Forsyth idly mentions Tolstoy and Zeitgeist alongside one another?--&gt;  the social circumstances at the time.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2009"/&gt; 

[[Great man theory]] and zeitgeist theory can be included in two main areas of thought in [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2009"/&gt; For instance, [[great man theory]] is very similar to the [[Trait theory|trait approach]]. Trait researchers are interested in identifying the various personality traits that underline human behaviors such as conformity, leadership or other social behaviors. Thus, they agree that leadership is primarily a quality of an individual and that some people are pre-dispositioned to be a leader whereas others are born to follow these leaders. In contrast, [[Situationism (psychology)|situationist]] researchers believe that social behavior is a product of society. That is, social influence is what determines human behaviors. Therefore, [[Situationism (psychology)|situationism]] is of the same opinion as zeitgeist theory—leaders are created from the social environment and are molded from the situation. The concept of zeitgeist also relates to the sociological tradition that stems from [[Émile Durkheim]] and recently developed into [[social capital]] theory as exemplified by the work of [[Patrick Hunout]].

These two perspectives have been combined to create what is known as the ''interactional'' approach to [[leadership]].&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2009"/&gt; This approach asserts that leadership is developed through the mixing of personality traits and the situation. Further, this approach was expressed by social psychologist, [[Kurt Lewin]], by the equation B = f(P, E) where behavior (B) is a function (f) of the person (P) and the environment (E).

===Examples of models in business===
Executives, venture capitalists, journalists and authors have argued that the idea of a zeitgeist is useful in understanding the emergence of industries, simultaneous invention and evaluating the relative value of innovations. [[Malcolm Gladwell]] argued in his book ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'' that entrepreneurs who succeeded often share similar characteristics—early personal or significant exposure to knowledge and skills in the early stages of a nascent industry. He proposed that the timing of involvement in an industry and often in sports as well affected the probability of success. In [[Silicon Valley]], a number of people ([[Peter Thiel]], Alistair Davidson, Mac Levchin, [[Nicholas G. Carr]], [[Vinod Khosla]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/428526/silicon-valleys-trouble-with-innovation/|title=Silicon Valley's Trouble with Innovation|work=MIT Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have argued that much innovation has been shaped by easy access to the Internet, [[open source software]], component technologies for both hardware and software (e.g., software libraries, [[software as a service]]), and the ability to reach narrow markets across a global market. Peter Thiel has commented: "There is so much [[incrementalism]] now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://topics.bloomberg.com/peter-thiel/|title=Peter Thiel|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a zeitgeist market, the number of new entrants is high, differentiation in high value products (the strongest predictor of new product success) is more difficult to achieve, and [[business model]]s emphasizing service and solution over product and process will enhance success. Examples include innovation in product experience, legal rights and bundling, privacy rights, and agency (where businesses act on behalf of customers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/qa/428186/max-levchin/|title=Max Levchin|work=MIT Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304141204577508820786062502|title=Why Modern Innovation Traffics in Trifles - WSJ|author=Nicholas Carr|date=6 July 2012|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/khosla-the-silicon-valley-vision/|title= Vinod Khosla: Maintain the Silicon Valley Vision|author= Vinod Khosla	|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eclicktick.com/innovationzeitgeist/|title=The Book - Innovation Zeitgeist|work=eclicktick.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual fashion==
{{synthesis|date=March 2018}}
{{See also|Multiple discovery}}
''Zeitgeist'' in the sense intellectual or aesthetic [[fashion]] or [[fad]]:

* Research from [[Experimental aesthetics|empirical aesthetics]] investigated the relation between zeitgeist as temporal context and the evaluation of [[Creativity|creative]] works. In a study of the musical originality of 15,618 classical [[Theme (music)|music themes]], the importance of objective characteristics and zeitgeist for popularity was examined. Both the musical originality of a theme relative to its contemporary works (the zeitgeist), as well as its "absolute" originality influenced in similar [[Effect size|magnitude]] the popularity of a theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simonton|first=Dean K.|date=1980|title=Thematic fame, melodic originality, and musical zeitgeist: A biographical and transhistorical content analysis.|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/38/6/972|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=38|issue=6|pages=972–983|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.38.6.972|issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, objective features and temporal context both influenced the evaluation of linguistic originality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|date=2018-01-30|title=Reaching Wuthering Heights with Brave New Words: The Influence of Originality of Words on the Success of Outstanding Best-Sellers|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/jocb.230|journal=The Journal of Creative Behavior|language=en|doi=10.1002/jocb.230|issn=0022-0175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Errors of illusion are not readily apparent because the shared beliefs and assumptions of a particular era that support them come from the zeitgeist. An example can be seen with [[Henry H. Goddard]] and [[Lewis Terman]]. The consensus in the 20th century was that existing psychology tests adequately measured basic intelligence in diverse groups of people. The more recent consensus is that "culture-fair" tests need to be developed - which may or may not be true. But because of the zeitgeist, in those times, the cross-cultural validity of existing tests was not questioned.&lt;ref name="Hothersall"&gt;Hothersall, D., "History of Psychology", 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
* Failure to question research findings that agree with prevailing political and philosophical ideology represents one of the effects of the zeitgeist.&lt;ref name="Hothersall"/&gt;
* The zeitgeist does not always have negative effects. It can stimulate new ideas and creative solutions to problems. An example is seen in the different models and metaphors chosen to describe behavior and consciousness.&lt;ref name="Hothersall"/&gt;
* [[Charles Darwin]]'s proposition that [[evolution]] occurs by [[natural selection]] has been cited as a case of the zeitgeist, since his contemporary, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], was outlining similar models to Darwin during the same period (ideas that were jointly presented to the public).&lt;ref name="Hothersall"/&gt; This view is disputed, however, by accounts that emphasize the relative simplicity of Wallace's model, and which highlight a supposed novelty within Darwin's likewise simplistic contribution.&lt;ref name="Bowler"&gt;Bowler, Peter J., ''The Non-Darwinian Revolution'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The zeitgeist of the 1920s revolved around [[logical positivism]]. Due to this, the great men and women of that time were able to impact psychology, such as Watson, Tolman, and Guthrie. This is important because their work on behavioral psychology was able to work against eugenics. Before this time behavioral psychology was not able to impact the field since it did not fit with the spirit of the times. For example, Twitmyer [[Edwin B. Twitmyer]] wrote a paper on the patellar reflex in 1902, but it came too early to have the impact it deserved.&lt;ref name="Hothersall"/&gt;
* [[B F Skinner]] being unseated during the cognitive revolution is another example of the zeitgeist in psychology. The zeitgeist was changing during this time, people wanted to show more interest in humans, and more people were becoming interested in personality psychology. However, in the 1950s his new experimental approach to psychology using inductive reasoning and descriptive behaviorism was seen as novel and practical. Especially in contrast with psychoanalysts, whose assertions and interpretations were largely immune to rigorous, empirical inquiry, thus making validation a rather problematic task.&lt;ref name="Hothersall"/&gt;
