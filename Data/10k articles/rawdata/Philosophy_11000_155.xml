'''''Agathos kai sophos''''' ({{lang-grc|ἀγαθὸς καὶ σοφὸς}})&lt;ref&gt;''[[Meno]]'' 93e, ''[[Hippias Minor]]'' 367e.&lt;/ref&gt; is a phrase coined by [[Plato]], which literally means "wise and good" in Greek.  The [[Athenians]] used this phrase to describe the qualities of an honest man.

Plato apparently derived this phrase from an earlier ''[[kalos kagathos]]''—literally, "beautiful and good".  The [[Greeks]] believed that external beauty (kalos) was associated with inner beauty, [[morality]] and virtue, suggesting that a beautiful face was the outward expression of a beautiful soul.  To avoid this association, which often led to confusion, Plato reinvented the expression as ''agathos kai sophos'', separating external beauty from the beauty of the soul.

'''Angela Hunter "Angie" Hobbs''' (born 12 June 1961) is a British [[philosopher]] and academic, who specialises in [[Ancient Greek philosophy]] and [[ethics]]. She is Professor of the Public Understanding of Philosophy at the [[University of Sheffield]].

==Early life and education==
Hobbs was born on 12 June 1961 in [[Rudgwick]], [[Sussex]], England.&lt;ref name="Who's Who 2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=HOBBS, Prof. Angela Hunter|url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U257704|website=Who's Who 2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=14 June 2016|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was educated at [[The College of Richard Collyer]], a state school in  [[Horsham]], West Sussex.&lt;ref name="Who's Who 2016" /&gt; 

In 1980, Hobbs [[matriculated]] into New Hall, Cambridge (now [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge]]).&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite web|title=CURRICULUM VITAE|url=http://static.squarespace.com/static/503e0ed3c4aae24275de4851/t/503f8314e4b01fd887a54a6d/1346339604102/|website=angiehobbs.com|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied [[classics]], and graduated from the [[University of Cambridge]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) degree in 1983.&lt;ref name="Who's Who 2016" /&gt; She won two prizes during her undergraduate studies: the Park Prize for Classics (awarded by New Hall), and the Henry Arthur Thomas Travel Exhibition (awarded by the [[Faculty of Classics, University of Cambridge|Faculty of Classics]]).&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt; As per tradition, her BA was promoted to a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] (MA Cantab) degree in 1986.&lt;ref name="Who's Who 2016" /&gt; She gained a PhD in Classical Philosophy (Cambridge).

==Academic career==
After a Research Fellowship at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], Hobbs became Senior Fellow in the Public Understanding of Philosophy and Lecturer in Philosophy at the [[University of Warwick]]. She is a specialist in [[Ancient Greek philosophy]] with a particular interest in [[ethics]], [[political theory]], and [[moral psychology]].

In April 2012, the [[University of Sheffield]] announced Hobbs' appointment as Professor of the Public Understanding of Philosophy, the first such chair in the UK. Hobbs is now preparing a translation of [[Symposium (Plato)|Plato's ''Symposium'']], with a commentary, for Oxford University Press.

She contributes to TV and radio programmes. These contributions include BBC Two's ''[[Timewatch]]'' special "Atlantis: The Evidence", the National Geographic Channel's "Finding Atlantis", the Radio 4 programme ''[[In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)|In Our Time]]'' hosted by [[Melvyn Bragg]], Radio 3 ''[[Night Waves]]'' and the BBC World Services ''The Forum''. 

On 1 February 2015, Hobbs was the castaway  on ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' on [[BBC Radio 4]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b050yh93 Desert Island Discs]' BBC Radio 4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Annette Claire Baier''' ([[née]] '''Stoop'''; 11 October 1929 – 2 November 2012) was a New Zealand [[philosopher]] and [[David Hume|Hume]] scholar, focused in particular on Hume's [[moral psychology]]. She was well known also for her contributions to [[feminist philosophy]] and to the philosophy of mind, where she was strongly influenced by her former colleague, [[Wilfrid Sellars]].

==Biography==
For most of her career she taught in the philosophy department at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], having moved there from [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. She retired to her native [[Dunedin]], [[New Zealand]], where she graduated from the [[University of Otago]].

She was former President of the Eastern Division of the [[American Philosophical Association]], an office reserved for the elite of her profession. Baier received an honorary Doctor of Literature from the University of Otago in 1999.

Her husband was the philosopher [[Kurt Baier]].

==Ethics==
Baier's approach to ethics is that women and men make their decisions about right and wrong based on different value systems: men take their moral decisions according to an idea of [[justice]], while women are motivated by a sense of [[Trust (emotion)|trust]] or [[ethics of care|caring]]. The history of philosophy having been overwhelmingly compiled by men, she suggests, leads to a body of thought which apparently ignores the role of nurture and trust in human philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open2.net/historyandthearts/philosophy_ethics/baier.html Annette Baier (1929 -)] from [http://www.open2.net Open2.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6848">'''Argument from analogy''' is a special type of [[Inductive reasoning|inductive argument]], whereby perceived similarities are used as a basis to infer some further similarity that has yet to be observed.  Analogical reasoning is one of the most common methods by which human beings attempt to understand the world and make decisions.&lt;ref name="Baronett"&gt;{{Cite book

| pages = 321–325}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When a person has a bad experience with a product and decides not to buy anything further from the producer, this is often a case of analogical reasoning.  It is also implicit in much of science; for instance, experiments on laboratory rats typically proceed on the basis that some physiological similarities between rats and humans entails some further similarity (e.g. possible reactions to a drug).&lt;ref name="salmon"&gt;{{citation|last=Salmon|first=Merrilee|title=Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vd8JAAAAQBAJ|date=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-133-71164-2|pages=132–142|chapter=Arguments from analogy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The process of analogical inference involves noting the shared properties of two or more things, and from this basis inferring that they also share some further property.&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gensler"&gt;{{Cite book
| last = Gensler
| first = Harry J.
| title = Introduction to Logic
| publisher = [[Routledge]]
| location = New York, NY
| year = 2003
| pages = 333–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The structure or form may be generalized like so:&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gensler"/&gt;

: P and Q are similar in respect to properties a, b, and c.
: P has been observed to have further property x.
: Therefore, Q probably has property x also.

The argument does not assert that the two things are ''large and very big'', only that they are ''similar''.  The argument may provide us with ''good evidence'' for the conclusion, but the conclusion does not follow as a matter of [[logical truth|logical necessity]].&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gensler"/&gt;  Determining the strength of the argument requires that we take into consideration more than just the ''form'': the ''content'' must also come under scrutiny.

== Analyzing arguments from analogy ==

===Strength of an analogy===

Several {{vanchor|factors}} affect the strength of the argument from analogy:
* The '''{{vanchor|relevance}}''' (positive or negative) of the ''known'' similarities to the similarity ''inferred in the conclusion''.&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gensler"/&gt;
* The '''{{vanchor|degree}}''' of relevant similarity (or dissimilarity) between the two objects.&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt;
* The '''{{vanchor|amount}}''' and '''{{vanchor|variety|diversity}}''' of instances that form the basis of the analogy.&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt;

===Counterarguments===

Arguments from analogy may be attacked by use of '''disanalogy''', '''counteranalogy''', and by pointing out '''unintended consequences''' of an analogy.&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;  In order to understand how one might go about analyzing an argument from analogy, consider the [[Watchmaker analogy|teleological argument]] and the criticisms of this argument put forward by the philosopher [[David Hume]].

According to the analogical reasoning in the teleological argument, it would be ridiculous to assume that a complex object such as a watch came about through some random process. Since we have no problem at all inferring that such objects must have had an intelligent designer who created it for some purpose, we ought to draw the same conclusion for another complex and apparently designed object: the universe.&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;

Hume argued that the universe and a watch have many relevant dissimilarities; for instance, the universe is often very disorderly and random. This is the strategy of "disanalogy": just as the amount and variety of relevant similarities between two objects strengthens an analogical conclusion, so do the amount and variety of relevant dissimilarities weaken it.&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;  Creating a "counteranalogy," Hume argued that some natural objects seem to have order and complexity — snowflakes for example — but are not the result of intelligent direction.&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;  But then just as the snowflake's order and complexity itself might not have direction, the causes of the order and complexity might.  So this would be an example of disproof by begging the question.  Finally, Hume provides many possible "unintended consequences" of the argument; for instance, given that objects such as watches are often the result of the labor of groups of individuals, the reasoning employed by the teleological argument would seem to lend support to polytheism.&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;

==False analogy==
A '''false analogy''' is a faulty instance of the argument from analogy.

An argument from analogy is weakened if it is inadequate in any of the [[#factors|above respects]]. The term "false analogy" comes from the philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]], who was one of the first individuals to engage in a detailed examination of analogical reasoning.&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt; One of Mill's examples involved an inference that some person is lazy from the observation that his or her sibling is lazy. According to Mill, sharing parents is not all that relevant to the property of laziness.&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt;

===Examples===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
A basic example:
"The model of the solar system is similar to that of an atom, with planets orbiting the sun like electrons orbiting the nucleus. Electrons can jump from orbit to orbit; so we should study ancient records for sightings of planets jumping from orbit to orbit."

Another example is:

Person A: ''"I think that people can have some affection for their cultural heritage."''

Person B: ''"You're just like [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]!"''

In the above example, Person B has evaded a reasoned discussion by tarring Person A with an irrelevant association to an idea that Hitler used.
No one person is identical to another to the extent that their proposals can be disparaged by a mere reference to that other person. It is a form of [[ad hominem]]: Attacking the messenger, rather than the message. The above example is also an example of [[Reductio ad Hitlerum]] and, in an online context, invokes [[Godwin's law]].

'''Armen Avanessian''' (*1973 in [[Vienna]]) is an Austrian philosopher, literary theorist, and political theorist. He has taught at the [[Free University of Berlin]], among other institutions, and held fellowships in the German departments of [[Columbia University]] and [[Yale University]]. His work on [[Speculative realism|Speculative Realism]] and [[Accelerationism]] in art and philosophy has found a wide audience beyond academia.

== Life ==
Of Armenian descent, born 1973 in Vienna, Armen Avanessian studied philosophy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geisteswissenschaften.fu-berlin.de/we03/institut/mitarbeiter/ehemalige/avanessian/index.html|title=Armen Avanessian|date=2008-07-30|website=www.geisteswissenschaften.fu-berlin.de|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and political science under [[Jacques Rancière]] in Paris. He completed his dissertation, 'Phenomenology of Ironic Spirit: Ethics, Poetics, and Politics in Modernity' , under the supervision of conservative theorist [[Karl Heinz Bohrer]] at the [[University of Bielefeld]]. For several years, he worked as a free-lance journalist, journal editor (Le Philosophoire, Paris), and in the publishing industry in London.

From 2007 to 2014, he taught in the Peter Szondi Institute for Comparative Literature at the Free University of Berlin. In 2011 he was a Visiting Fellow in the German Department at [[Columbia University]] and in 2012 in the German Department at [[Yale University]]. Since 2013, he has held visiting appointments at a number of art schools (in Nuremberg, Vienna, Basel, Copenhagen, California&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.calarts.edu/2015/10/06/aesthetics-politics-program-welcomes-armen-avanessian/|title=Aesthetics &amp; Politics Program Welcomes Armen Avanessian|website=24700|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In 2014, he became the chief editor at Merve Verlag, a Berlin publisher specializing in philosophy and political theory. In 2011, Armen Avanessian founded the bilingual research and publication platform Speculative Poetics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spekulative-poetik.de/|title=Programmatik des Projekts - Spekulative Poetik - Spekulative Poetik|website=www.spekulative-poetik.de|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; that brings together philosophers, writers, and artists from across the world around the idea of a new theoretical discipline in the making.

== Career ==
Following his dissertation, which had already explored phenomena at the intersection of art, politics, and philosophy, Avanessian focused on developing a new approach in literary theory and philosophy of language. Collaborating with colleagues such as Anke Hennig, he began working in 2011 on connecting new speculative-ontological approaches with twentieth-century philosophies of language, which resulted most notably in two co-written books, 'Present Tense: A Poetics' (2012, English translation 2015) and 'Metanoia: A Speculative Ontology of Language, Thinking, and the Brain' (2014, English translation forthcoming 2016). Moreover, he played a central role in bringing accelerationism into German-language political philosophy. In 2015, [[Wired (magazine)|Wired Magazine]] named him an intellectual innovator,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=WIRED Germany|title=Armen Avanessian // Die Innovatoren und Vordenker 2015|date=2015-01-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmg87gmsAA|accessdate=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting in particular his concern with post-capitalist ideas.

Avanessian’s work has come to be situated primarily outside the academy. It includes widely discussed statements on current affairs such as the [[European migrant crisis|refugee crisis]], numerous lectures in the international art and culture scene, as well as a large number of interviews and intellectual portraits. Beyond the classical academic mainstream, Avanessian has repeatedly managed to introduce new concepts and theoretical constellations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spikeartmagazine.com/de/artikel/armen-avanessian-theorien-fur-das-21-jahrhundert|title=Armen Avanessian: Theorien für das 21. Jahrhundert|date=2015-04-02|website=Spike Art Daily|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; into public discourse. These consist partly of neologisms, partly of concepts used in smaller circles, which Avanessian’s work as editor re-produces for the German-language context. Examples include “speculative realism,” “acceleration,” “Xenofeminism,” “hyperstition,” and, most recently, the concept of the “time complex: postcontemporary.” Hyperstition, moreover, is not just another concept, it also designates a method, namely the actualization in the present, from out of the future, of ideas or fictions.

Avanessian’s books have been translated into several languages, including English, Russian, Dutch, Spanish, and French.

== Literary Studies ==
Avanessian’s early publications are mostly scholarly books and essays on linguistics, semantics, and literary studies. His philosophical breakthrough came with the edited volumes on 'Speculative Realism' (Realism Now) and the German edition of the reader, '#Acceleration'. His move to Merve has emphasized his focus on editing current, not yet established philosophy, treating, in particular, questions in feminism, finance theory, and technology. He has also published books discussing the possibility of poeticizing philosophy.

His book 'Overwrite: Ethics of Knowledge, Poetics of Existence' (2015, English translation forthcoming) confronts the deplorable state of academia in an explicitly accelerationist way. Not limiting himself to mere criticism, Avanessian is constantly at work constructing alternative platforms such as the summer school he organized with [[Reza Negarestani]] and Pete Wolfendale at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Berlin, on “Emancipation as Navigation: From the Space of Reasons to the Space of Freedoms.”

== Art ==
Avanessian’s recently intensified activity in the field of art can also be understood as that of a postcontemporary artist trying to combine speculative questions in philosophy and art and make them accessible to a larger public. To that end, he uses not only classical publication formats in print, film projects, and academic lectures but also art festivals and exhibitions. The 2015 gallery festival “Tomorrow Today / curated by_vienna”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/141988278|title=viennacontemporary 2015 {{!}} Talk: curated by_vienna: Tomorrow Today|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, was based on Avanessian’s homonymous essay and combined the work of twenty well-known curators with the idea of an actual post-capitalism. Within the framework of the ninth Berlin Biennale, Avanessian conducted a ten-day Young Curators Workshop on alternatives to the economic and political models of contemporary art.

An analogous sense of discontent with the state of political theory and practice and with the lack of efficacy of political art led to the idea of a democratic and transparent intelligence agency named DISCREET,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/165568437|title=discreet|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; it will be founded by Alexander Martos and Avanessian, as artist, in the course of  multi-week project at the 2016 Berlin Biennale. Armen Avanessian is a regular contributor to art journals such as Spike, Texte zur Kunst, and DIS Magazine. He also writes frequently about art in philosophical contexts. For several years now, Avanessian has collaborated with the graphic artist, Andreas Töpfer, which has led to publications in print (with Merve and Sternberg Press) and on film.

== Radio ==
With columnist Georg Diez, media theorist Paul Feigelfeld, and author Julia Zange, Armen Avanessian hosts “60 Hertz” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berlincommunityradio.com/60hz|title=60HZ|date=2016-03-23|website=Berlin Community Radio|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a talk show airing every Monday on Berlin Community Radio. The show is conceived as an artistic rendering, in interviews and conversations, of everyday life in the 2010s. Episodes are usually broadcast in a mix of English and German language.

== Film ==
With Berlin director Christopher Roth, he has produced the film ''Hyperstition''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dismagazine.com/blog/77351/hyperstition-truth-is-science-is-fiction/|title=Hyperstition: Truth is Science is Fiction|last=Toro|first=Lauren Boyle, Solomon Chase, Marco Roso, Nick Scholl, David|website=DIS Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2016), which draws on ontology, science fiction, and sociology to question the concept of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/146435027|title=HYPERSTITION 15 minutes out of 102 about Time &amp; Narrative|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screened at several festivals in Europe and the United States, the film consists of conversations with established as well as younger philosophers such as [[Nick Srnicek]], Elie Ayache, [[Ray Brassier]] and others.

[[File:Bernardino Telesio.jpg|right|180px|thumb|Bernardino Telesio]]
'''Bernardino Telesio''' ({{IPA-it|bernarˈdiːno teˈlɛːzjo|lang}}; 7 November 1509&amp;nbsp;– 2 October 1588) was an Italian philosopher and [[natural science|natural scientist]].
While his natural theories were later disproven, his emphasis on observation made him the "first of the moderns" who eventually developed the
[[scientific method]].

==Biography==
Telesio was born of noble parentage in [[Cosenza]], a city in [[Calabria]], Southern Italy. He was educated in [[Milan]] by his uncle, Antonio, himself a scholar and a poet of eminence, and afterwards in Rome and [[Padua]]. His studies included all the wide range of subjects, [[classics]], science and philosophy, which constituted the curriculum of the [[Renaissance]] savants. Thus equipped, he began his attack upon the medieval Aristotelianism which then flourished in Padua and [[Bologna]]. In 1553 he married and settled in Cosenza, becoming the founder of the [[Cosentian Academy]]. For a time he lived in the household of Alfonso III [[House of Carafa|Carafa]], Duke of Nocera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/telesio/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] entry on Telesio.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1563, or perhaps two years later, appeared his great work ''De Rerum Natura Iuxta Propria Principia'' (''On the Nature of Things according to their Own Principles''), which was followed by a large number of scientific and philosophical works of subsidiary importance. The heterodox views which he maintained aroused the anger of the Church on behalf of its cherished [[Aristotle|Aristotelianism]], and a short time after his death his books were placed on the Index.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Telesio, Bernardino |volume=26 |page=572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of matter, heat and cold==
Instead of postulating matter and form, he bases existence on matter and force. This force has two opposing elements: heat, which expands, and cold, which contracts. These two processes account for all the diverse forms and types of existence, while the mass on which the force operates remains the same. The harmony of the whole consists in this, that each separate thing develops in and for itself in accordance with its own nature while at the same time its motion benefits the rest. The obvious defects of this theory, (1) that the senses alone cannot apprehend matter itself, (2) that it is not clear how the multiplicity of phenomena could result from these two forces, thought it is no less convincing than Aristotles hot/cold, dry/wet explanation, and (3) that he adduced no evidence to substantiate the existence of these two forces, were pointed out at the time by his pupil, [[Franciscus Patricius|Patrizzi]].

Moreover, his theory of the cold earth at rest and the hot sun in motion was doomed to disproof at the hands of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]]. At the same time, the theory was sufficiently coherent to make a great impression on Italian thought. It should be mentioned, though, that his obliteration of a distinction between superlunar and sublunar physics was certainly quite prescient though not acknowledged by his successors as particularly worthy of note. When Telesio went on to explain the relation of mind and matter, he was still more heterodox. Material forces are, by hypothesis, capable of feeling; matter also must have been from the first endowed with consciousness. For consciousness exists, and could not have been developed out of nothing. This leads him to a form of [[hylozoism]]. Again, the soul is influenced by material conditions; consequently the soul must have a material existence. He further held that all knowledge is sensation ("non-ratione sed sensu") and that intelligence is, therefore, an agglomeration of isolated data, given by the senses. He does not, however, succeed in explaining how the senses alone can perceive difference and identity.

At the end of his scheme, probably in deference to [[theology|theological]] prejudices, he added an element which was utterly alien, namely, a higher impulse, a soul superimposed by God, in virtue of which we strive beyond the world of sense. This divine soul is hardly a completely novel concept if viewed in the context of [[Averroes]]tic or [[Thomas Aquinas|Thomasian]] perceptual theory.

The whole system of Telesio shows gaps in his argument, and ignorance of essential facts, but at the same time it is a forerunner of all subsequent [[empiricism]], scientific and philosophical, and marks clearly the period of transition from authority and reason to experiment and individual responsibility.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Reliance on sensory data==
[[Image:Piazza XV marzo.jpg|thumb|Statue of Bernardino Telesio in the Piazza XV marzo, Cosenza]]
Telesio was the head of the great Southern Italian movement which protested against the accepted authority of [[abstract reason]], and sowed the seeds from which sprang the scientific methods of [[Tommaso Campanella]] and [[Giordano Bruno]], of [[Francis Bacon]] and [[René Descartes]], with their widely divergent results. He, therefore, abandoned the purely intellectual sphere and proposed an inquiry into the data provided by the senses, from which he held that all true knowledge really comes (his theory of sense perception was essentially a reworking of Aristotle's theory from ''[[On the Soul|De Anima]]'').

Telesio writes in the beginning of the [[preface|Proem]] of the first book of the third edition of ''De Rerum Natura Iuxta Propria Principia Libri Ix''... "That the construction of the world and the magnitude of the bodies contained within it, and the nature of the world, is to be searched for not by reason as was done by the ancients, but is to be understood by means of observation." (''Mundi constructionem, corporumque in eo contentorum magnitudinem, naturamque non-ratione, quod antiquioribus factum est, inquirendam, sed sensu percipiendam.'') This statement, found on the very first page, summarizes what many modern scholars have generally considered to be Telesian philosophy, and it often seems that many did not read any further for on the very next page he sets up his hot/cold theory of informed matter, a theory that is clearly not informed by our modern idea of observation. For Telesio, observation (''sensu percipiendam'') is a much larger mental process than simply recording data, observation also includes analogical thought.

Though Francis Bacon is generally credited nowadays with the codification of an [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] method that wholeheartedly endorses observation as the primary procedure for acquiring knowledge, he was certainly not the first to suggest that sensory perception should be the primary source for knowledge. Among natural philosophers from the Renaissance, this honor is generally bestowed upon Telesio. Bacon himself acknowledges Telesio as being "the first of the moderns" (''De Telesio autem bene sentimus, atque eum ut amantem veritatis, &amp; Scientiis utilem, &amp; nonnullorum Placitorum emendatorem &amp; novorum hominum primum agnoscimus.'', from Bacon's ''De principiis atque originibus'') for putting observation above all other methods for acquiring knowledge about the natural world. This frequently quoted phrase from Bacon, though, is misleading, for it oversimplifies and misrepresents Bacon's opinion of Telesio. Most of Bacon's essay is an attack on Telesio and this phrase, invariably taken out of context, has facilitated a general misconception of Telesian natural philosophy by giving to it a Baconian stamp of approval, which was far from Bacon's original intentions. Bacon sees in Telesio an ally in the fight against ancient authority, but he has little positive to say about Telesio's specific theories.

What is perhaps most striking about ''De rerum natura'' is Telesio's attempt to mechanize as much as possible. Telesio clearly strives to explain everything in terms of matter informed by hot and cold and to keep his arguments as simple as possible. When his discussions turn to human beings he introduces an instinct of self-preservation to account for their motivations. And when he discusses the human mind and its ability to reason in the abstract about immaterial and divine topics, he adds a soul. For without a soul, all thought, by his reasoning, would be limited to material things. This would make God unthinkable and clearly this was not the case, for observation proves that people think about God.

Mercer began her career working primarily in [[early modern philosophy]].

Mercer has begun to devote herself more and more to contextualizing the history of philosophy. She has designed a book series, [http://www.oxford-philosophical-concepts.com Oxford Philosophical Concepts], that enlists prominent international scholars to think creatively about the "lives" of concepts in the history of philosophy. As of 2018, there are more than 20 volumes in various stages of production, and 11 published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://philosophy.columbia.edu/directories/faculty/christia-mercer|title=Christia Mercer|website=philosophy.columbia.edu|language=custom|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include ''Animals, Dignity, Efficient Causation, Embodiment, Eternity, The Faculties, Memory, Moral Motivation, Pleasure, Self-Knowledge,'' and ''Sympathy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxford-philosophical-concepts.com|title=Oxford Philosophical Concepts|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oxford-philosophical-concepts.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the volumes traces the historical development of central philosophical concepts and includes interdisciplinary "reflections."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxford-philosophical-concepts.com|title=Oxford Philosophical Concepts|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oxford-philosophical-concepts.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also the editor of the [https://www.oxford-new-histories.com Oxford New Histories of Philosophy] series, which she launched with the late Eileen O’Neill&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxford-new-histories.com/eileen-oneill-memorial-fund/|title=Eileen O'Neill Memorial Fund|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oxford-new-histories.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now co-edits with Melvin Rogers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxford-new-histories.com/series-editors-foreward/|title=Oxford New Histories of Philosophy Series Editors' Foreward|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oxford-new-histories.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which "speaks to a growing concern to broaden and reexamine philosophy’s past".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxford-new-histories.com|title=Oxford New Histories of Philosophy|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oxford-new-histories.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first book in this series is titled ''Mexican Philosophy in the 20th Century'' (2017) was edited by Carlos Alberto Sanchez and Robert Eli Sanchez.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxford-new-histories.com/432-2/|title=Oxford New Histories of Philosophy Published Volumes|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oxford-new-histories.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercer has written about about the importance of inclusive history of philosophy in op-eds for the ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/opinion/descartes-is-not-our-father.html New York Times]'' and the ''[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/04/28/philosophys-gender-bias-for-too-long-scholars-say-women-have-been-ignored/?utm_term=.a88938a84116 Washington Post]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/cm50/biography|title=Biography – Christia Mercer|website=blogs.cuit.columbia.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivated by her friend, Eileen O’Neill, she has become increasingly devoted to discovering and articulating the ideas of early modern and late medieval women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailynous.com/2017/12/06/eileen-oneill-1953-2017-obituary-christia-mercer/|title=Eileen O’Neill, 1953-2017 (obituary by Christia Mercer) - Daily Nous|website=dailynous.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her paper, “Descartes’ Debt to Teresa of Ávila, Or Why We Should Work on Women in the History of Philosophy,” in ''Phil Studies'', August, 2016, exposes Descartes’ debt to Teresa of Ávila.

Her forthcoming book, ''Feeling the Way to Truth: Women, Reason and the Development of Modern Philosophy,'' argues that historians of philosophy need to rethink core assumptions about seventeenth-century philosophy and that the writings of women play a much more significant part in that history than has been recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/event/2018-christia-mercer-fellow-presentation|title=Feeling the Way to Truth: Women, Reason, and the Development of Early Modern Philosophy|date=2018-07-18|work=Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchens includes chapters entitled "The Metaphysical Claims of Religion are False" and "Arguments from Design," but his more journalistic treatment of the cases for and against God's existence amounts primarily to the claim that the God hypothesis is unnecessary since science can now explain what theism was formerly thought to be required to explain, including phenomena such as the appearance of design in the universe."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christopher Eric Hitchens''' (13 April 1949 – 15 December 2011) was an Anglo-American author, columnist, essayist, orator, religious,  literary and social critic, and journalist. Hitchens was the author, co-author, editor or co-editor of over 30 books, including five collections of essays on culture, politics and literature. A staple of public discourse, his confrontational style of debate made him both a lauded [[public intellectual|intellectual]] and a controversial public figure. He contributed to ''[[New Statesman]]'', ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', ''[[The Atlantic]]'', ''[[London Review of Books]]'', ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', ''[[Free Inquiry]]'' and ''[[Vanity Fair magazine|Vanity Fair]]''.

Having long described himself as a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]] and an [[anti-totalitarianism|anti-totalitarian]], he broke from the political [[Left-wing politics|left]] after what he called the "tepid reaction" of the Western left to the [[The Satanic Verses controversy|''Satanic Verses'' controversy]], followed by the left's embrace of [[Bill Clinton]] and the antiwar movement's opposition to [[NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in the 1990s. His support of the [[Iraq War]] separated him further. His writings include critiques of public figures [[Bill Clinton]], [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Mother Teresa]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. He was the elder brother of the conservative journalist and author [[Peter Hitchens]]. He also advocated for the [[separation of church and state]].

As an [[antitheist]], he regarded concepts of a [[god]] or supreme being as a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] belief that impedes individual freedom. He argued in favour of [[Freedom of speech|free expression]] and scientific discovery, and that it was superior to religion as an [[ethics|ethical]] code of conduct for human civilization. The dictum "What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence" has become known as [[Hitchens's razor]].&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2003/10/mommie_dearest.html|title=Mommie Dearest|first=Christopher|last=Hitchens|work=Slate|date=20 October 2003|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Cillian|last=McGrattan|title=The Politics of Trauma and Peace-Building: Lessons from Northern Ireland|location=Abingdon|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|page=2|isbn=978-1138775183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

===Early life and education===
Hitchens was born the elder of two boys in [[Portsmouth]], [[Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813061232/http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/birth-marriage-death-and-parish-records/births-and-baptisms/england-and-wales-births-1837-2006?firstname=christopher%20e&amp;lastname=hitchens|title=Results for England &amp; Wales Births 1837–2006|publisher=findmypast|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when they were children Christopher never got on well with his brother [[Peter Hitchens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bethinking.org/atheism/the-brothers-hitchens|title=The Brothers Hitchens|first=Simon |last=Smart |publisher=bethinking.org|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Christian and socially conservative journalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/16/christopher-hitchens-obituary|title=Christopher Hitchens obituary |first=Peter |last=Wilby | authorlink= Peter Wilby | work=the Guardian |accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, Eric Ernest Hitchens (1909–1987) and Yvonne Jean Hitchens (née Hickman; 1921–1973), met in Scotland when both were serving in the [[Royal Navy]] during World War II. Christopher often referred to Eric as simply the 'commander'. Eric was deployed on {{HMS|Jamaica|44|6}} which took part in the sinking of the {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2|up=yes}} in the [[Battle of the North Cape]] on 26 December 1943. Christopher would pay tribute to his father's contribution to the war: "Sending a Nazi convoy raider to the bottom is a better day's work than any I have ever done." He also stated that "the remark that most summed him [his father] up was the flat statement that the war of 1939 to 1945 had been 'the only time when I really felt I knew what I was doing'." Eric Hitchens would later work as a bookkeeper for boatbuilders, speedboat-manufacturers and at a prep school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hichens|first=Christopher|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/features/2010/hitch22/the_commander_my_father_eric_hitchens.html|title=The Commander: My Father, Eric Hitchens|publisher=Slate.com|date=2 June 2010|accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yglesias|first=Matthew|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2255781/entry/2255782|title=The Commander: My Father, Eric Hitchens|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=20 October 2003|accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life, Hitchens identified as a secular Jew—since Judaism is matrilineal and he discovered his mother was Jewish.&lt;ref name="The Boy Can't Help It"&gt;{{cite web |first=Meryl |last=Gordon |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/media/features/868/ |title=The Boy Can't Help It|work=NYMag.com |date=8 May 2007 |accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tabletmag.com"&gt;{{cite web |first=Marc |last=Tracy |url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/86541/the-tenth-man-2 |title=On Christopher Hitchens' Jewishness |work=Tablet Magazine |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=23 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardianjewish"&gt;{{cite news |first=Lynn |last=Barber |authorlink= Lynn Barber |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/worldview/story/0,11581,683899,00.html |title=Look who's talking |work=The Observer |date=14 April 2002 |accessdate=1 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was a 'Wren' (a member of the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]]).&lt;ref name="Hitch-22 Independent"&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Walsh |work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/hitch22-a-memoir-by-christopher-hitchens-1984845.html |title=Hitch-22: a memoir by Christopher Hitchens |date=27 May 2010 |accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father's naval career required the family to move a number of times from base to base throughout Britain and its dependencies, including to [[Malta]], where Christopher's brother Peter was born in [[Sliema]] in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/14656/hitchens-death-and-the-malta-connection#.Wmplj-bTWhA|title=Hitchens, death and the Malta connection|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchens attended Mount House School (now absorbed into [[Mount Kelly School|Mount Kelly]]) in [[Tavistock, Devon|Tavistock]], [[Devon]], from the age of eight, followed by the independent [[The Leys School|Leys School]] in Cambridge.&lt;ref name=Barber-2002/&gt; In 1967, Hitchens enrolled at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was tutored by [[Steven Lukes]] and [[Anthony Kenny]] and read [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]], graduating in 1970 with a [[third-class degree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-16214335|title=Obituary: Christopher Hitchens|publisher=BBC|date=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens was 'bowled over' in his adolescence by [[Richard Llewellyn]]'s ''[[How Green Was My Valley]]'', [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ''[[Darkness at Noon]],'' [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', [[R. H. Tawney]]'s critique on ''Religion and the Rise of Capitalism,'' and the works of [[George Orwell]].&lt;ref name="Hitch-22 Independent"/&gt; In 1968, he took part in the TV quiz show ''[[University Challenge]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Blake |last=Morrison |authorlink= Blake Morrison|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/29/hitch-22-christopher-hitchens-review |title=I contain multitudes |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=29 May 2010 |accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Hitchens joined the [[political left]], drawn by disagreement over the [[Vietnam War]], [[nuclear weapons]], [[racism]], and [[oligarchy]], including that of "the unaccountable corporation". He expressed affinity with the [[politically]] charged [[countercultural]] and [[protest]] movements [[Counterculture of the 1960s|of the 1960s and 1970s]]. He avoided the recreational drug use of the time, saying "in my cohort we were slightly anti-hedonistic...it made it very much easier for police provocation to occur, because the planting of drugs was something that happened to almost everyone one knew."&lt;ref name="hoover.org"&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Robinson |url=http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/3420306.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915092414/http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/3420306.html|archivedate=15 September 2007|publisher=Hoover Institution |title=You said you wanted a revolution: 1968 and the Counter-Counterculture (Peter Robinson interview with William Buckley Jr and Christopher Hitchens)|work=web.archive.org |date=15 September 2007|accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens was inspired to become a journalist after reading a piece by [[James Cameron (journalist)|James Cameron]].&lt;ref name=Barber-2002&gt;{{cite news|last=Barber|first=Lynn|authorlink= Lynn Barber |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/apr/14/politics|title=Look who's talking|work=The Observer|date=14 April 2002|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens was [[bisexuality|bisexual]] during his younger days.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web |first=Decca |last=Aitkenhead |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/22/christopher-hitchens-decca-aitkenhead|publisher=The Guardian| title=Christopher Hitchens: 'I was right and they were wrong'| work=Decca Aitkenhead| date=21 May 2010|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to have had sexual relations with two male students at Oxford who would later become [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tory]] ministers during the [[prime ministership of Margaret Thatcher]], although he would not reveal their names publicly.&lt;ref name="Mail gay"&gt;{{cite news |last=Levy |first=Geoffery |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1255852/So-WERE-Tory-ministers-gay-flings-Christopher-Hitchens-Oxford.html |title=So Who Were the Two Tory Ministers Who Had Gay Flings with Christopher Hitchens at Oxford? |work=Daily Mail |date=6 March 2010 |accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his career Hitchens began working as a correspondent for the magazine ''[[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |url=http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/1972/no051/hitchens2.htm |title=International Socialism: Christopher Hitchens "Workers' Self Management in Algeria" (1st series) |issue=51, April–June 1972 |page=33 |work=Encyclopedia of Trotskyism |date=1 April 1972 |accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by the International Socialists, the forerunners of today's British [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]]. This group was broadly Trotskyist, but differed from more orthodox Trotskyist groups in its refusal to defend communist states as "[[workers' states]]". Their slogan was "Neither Washington nor Moscow but International Socialism".

In 1971 Hitchens went to work at the ''[[Times Higher Education|Times Higher Education Supplement]]'' where he served as a [[social science]] correspondent. Hitchens admitted that he hated the position, and was fired after six months in the job. Next he was a researcher for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Weekend World]]''.&lt;ref name=NewStatesman2012&gt;{{cite web|last=Eaton |first=George|author-link=George Eaton (journalist) |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/magazines/2012/01/hitchens-write-editor-fenton |title=Christopher Hitchens: the New Statesman years |work=The New Statesman|date=2 January 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 he went to work for the ''[[New Statesman]]'', where his colleagues included the authors [[Martin Amis]], whom he had briefly met at Oxford, [[Julian Barnes]] and [[James Fenton]], with whom he had shared a house in Oxford.&lt;ref name=NewStatesman2012/&gt; Around that time, the Friday lunches began, which were attended by writers including [[Clive James]], [[Ian McEwan]], [[Kingsley Amis]], [[Terence Kilmartin]],  [[Robert Conquest]], [[Al Alvarez]], [[Peter Porter (poet)|Peter Porter]], [[Russell Davies]] and [[Mark Boxer]].  At the ''New Statesman'' Hitchens acquired a reputation as a left-winger, reporting internationally from areas of conflict such as Northern Ireland, Libya, and Iraq.&lt;ref name=NewStatesman2012 /&gt;

In November 1973, while in Greece, Hitchens reported on the constitutional crisis of the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74|military junta]]. It became his first leading article for the ''New Statesman''.&lt;ref name=Barber-2002/&gt; In December 1977, Hitchens interviewed Argentine dictator [[Jorge Rafael Videla]], a conversation he later described as "horrifying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/12/hitchens200412 |title=Kissinger Declassified |work=Vanity Fair |date=17 October 2006 |accessdate=23 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, unhappy at the ''New Statesman'', Hitchens defected to the ''[[Daily Express]]'' where he became a foreign correspondent. He returned to the ''New Statesman'' in 1979 where he became foreign editor.&lt;ref name=NewStatesman2012/&gt;

===American writings (1981–2011)===
Hitchens went to the United States in 1981 as part of an editor exchange programme between the ''[[New Statesman]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/165318/remembering-hitchens# |title=Remembering Hitchens |first=Victor |last=Navasky |authorlink=Victor Navasky |work=[[The Nation]] |date=21 December 2011 |accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After joining ''The Nation'', he penned vociferous critiques of [[Ronald Reagan]], [[George H.

Hitchens spent part of his early career in journalism as a foreign correspondent in [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Heather |last=Christie |url=http://www.shedoesthecity.com/at_the_rom_three_new_commandments |title=At the ROM: Three New Commandments |website=She Does The City|date=30 April 2009 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his work there he met his first wife Eleni Meleagrou, a [[Greek Cypriots|Greek Cypriot]], with whom he had two children, Alexander and Sophia.

Hitchens met Carol Blue in Los Angeles in 1989 and they married in 1991. Hitchens called it love at first sight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Carol |last=Blue |url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/latenightlive/an-afterword-to-the-life-of-christopher-hitchens-v2/4305582 |title=An afterword to the life of Christopher Hitchens – Late Night Live – ABC Radio National (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |work=Radio National |date=15 October 2012  |accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Hitchens and Blue, both harsh critics of President Clinton, submitted an affidavit to the trial managers of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the [[impeachment of Bill Clinton]]. Therein they swore that their then friend [[Sidney Blumenthal]] had described [[Monica Lewinsky]] as a stalker.

Before Hitchens's political shift, the American author and polemicist [[Gore Vidal]] was apt to speak of Hitchens as his "[[Dauphin of France|dauphin]]" or "heir".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2004/01/letters.htm|title=Hitchens on Books|accessdate=17 February 2009|first=Andrew |last=Werth |date=January–February 2004|work=[[The Atlantic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osdir.com/ml/politics.leftists.monkeyfist/2001-04/msg00016.html|title=Gore should be so lucky|accessdate=17 February 2009|first=John|last=Banville|date=3 March 2001|work=The Irish Times|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106195116/http://osdir.com/ml/politics.leftists.monkeyfist/2001-04/msg00016.html|archivedate=6 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Hitchens attacked Vidal in a ''Vanity Fair'' piece headlined "Vidal Loco", calling him a "crackpot" for his adoption of [[9/11 conspiracy theories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/02/hitchens-201002|title=Vidal Loco|accessdate=24 June 2010 |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |date=February 2010|work=Vanity Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/hitchens-attacks-gore-vidal-for-being-a-crackpot-1891753.html|title=Hitchens attacks Gore Vidal for being a 'crackpot'|accessdate=17 February 2009|date=7 February 2010|work=The Independent|location=London|first=Kate|last=Youde}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the back of Hitchens's memoir ''Hitch-22,'' among the praise from notable figures, Vidal's endorsement of Hitchens as his successor is crossed out in red and annotated "NO, C.H." Hitchens's strong advocacy of the war in Iraq gained him a wider readership, and in September 2005 he was named as fifth on the list of the "[[The 2005 Global Intellectuals Poll|Top 100 Public Intellectuals]]" by ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' and ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2005/10/15/prospectfp-top-100-public-intellectuals-results/ |publisher=The Foreign Policy Group |title=Top 100 Public Intellectuals Results |date=15 May 2008 |accessdate=1 January 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611230220/http://foreignpolicy.com/2005/10/15/prospectfp-top-100-public-intellectuals-results/ |archivedate=11 June 2015 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; An online poll ranked the 100 intellectuals, but the magazines noted that the rankings of Hitchens (5), [[Noam Chomsky]] (1), and [[Abdolkarim Soroush]] (15) were partly due to their respective supporters' publicising of the vote. Hitchens later responded to his ranking with a few articles about his status as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/what-is-a-public-intellectual |title=How to be a public intellectual |work=Prospect |date=24 May 2008 |accessdate=1 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/10/07/the-plight-of-the-public-intellectual/ |title=The Plight of the Public Intellectual |work=Foreign Policy |date=7 October 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchens did not leave his position writing for ''The Nation'' until after the [[September 11 attacks]], stating that he felt the magazine had arrived at a position "that [[John Ashcroft]] is a greater menace than [[Osama bin Laden]]".&lt;ref name=":78"&gt;{{cite news |first=Noam |last=Chomsky |authorlink= Noam Chomsky|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/reply-hitchenss-rejoinder |title=Reply to Hitchens's Rejoinder |work=The Nation |date=15 October 2001 |accessdate=1 June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 11 September attacks "exhilarated" him, bringing into focus "a battle between everything I love and everything I hate" and strengthening his embrace of an [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] foreign policy that challenged "[[Islamofascism|fascism with an Islamic face]]."&lt;ref name="left-to-right" /&gt; His numerous editorials in support of the [[Iraq War]] caused some to label him a [[Neoconservatism|neoconservative]], although Hitchens insisted he was not "a conservative of any kind", and his friend [[Ian McEwan]] described him as representing the anti-[[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] left.&lt;ref name="NewStatesman2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eaton|first=George|author-link=George Eaton (journalist)|work=The New Statesman|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2010/07/conservative-course-presidency|title=Interview: Christopher Hitchens|date=12 July 2010|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens recalls in his memoir having been "invited by [[Bernard-Henri Levy]] to write an essay on political reconsiderations for his magazine ''La Regle du Jeu''. I gave it the partly ironic title: 'Can One Be a Neoconservative?' Impatient with this, some copy editor put it on the cover as 'How I Became a Neoconservative.' Perhaps this was an instance of the Cartesian principle as opposed to the English empiricist one: It was decided that I evidently was what I apparently only thought." Indeed, in a 2010 BBC interview, he stated that he "still [thought] like a Marxist" and considered himself "a leftist."&lt;ref&gt;

===Literature reviews===
Hitchens wrote a monthly essay in ''[[The Atlantic]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/by/christopher_hitchens |title=Authors – Christopher Hitchens |work=[[The Atlantic]] |accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally contributed to other literary journals. One of his books, ''Unacknowledged Legislation: Writers in the Public Sphere'', collected these works. In ''Why Orwell Matters'', he defends Orwell's writings against modern critics as relevant today and progressive for his time. In the 2008 book ''Christopher Hitchens and His Critics: Terror, Iraq, and the Left'', many literary critiques are included of essays and other books of writers, such as [[David Horowitz]] and [[Edward Said]].

During a three-hour ''[[In Depth]]'' interview on ''Book TV'', he named authors who influenced his views, including [[Aldous Huxley]], [[George Orwell]], [[Evelyn Waugh]], [[Kingsley Amis]], [[P. G. Wodehouse]] and [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]].&lt;ref name="Christopher Hitchens In Depth"&gt;{{cite episode |title=In Depth with Christopher Hitchens |series=[[BookTV]] |network=[[C-SPAN]] |airdate=2 September 2007 |url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?198800-1/depth-christopher-hitchens |accessdate=23 April 2016}}; List of writers can be seen @ 1:13:10&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchens's political perspectives also appear in his wide-ranging writings, which include many dialogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2010/05/the-brothers-grim|date=June–July 2010|title=The Brothers Grim |last=Dalrymple |first=Theodore|authorlink= Theodore Dalrymple |work= First Things |accessdate=25 December 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825051556/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2010/05/the-brothers-grim |archivedate=25 August 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|objectivism]], "I have always found it quaint, and rather touching, that there is a movement in the US that thinks Americans are not yet selfish enough."&lt;ref name="masciotra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/03/01/libertarianism_is_for_petulant_children_ayn_rand_rand_paul_and_the_movements_sad_rebellion_partner/|title=Libertarianism is for petulant children: Ayn Rand, Rand Paul and the movement's sad "rebellion"|author=DAVID MASCIOTRA|website=salon.com|date=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Hitchens supported [[Israel's right to exist]], he was critical of the [[Israeli government]]'s handling of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. Having long described himself as a [[Democratic socialism|socialist]] and a [[Marxism|Marxist]], Hitchens began his break from the established political left after what he called the "tepid reaction" of the Western left to [[The Satanic Verses controversy|the controversy]] over ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', followed by the left's embrace of Bill Clinton, and the antiwar movement's opposition to [[NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in the 1990s. He later became a [[liberal hawk]] and supported the [[War on Terror]], but he had some reservation, such as his characterization of [[waterboarding]] as torture after voluntarily undergoing the procedure.&lt;ref name=believeme&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/08/hitchens200808 |title=Believe Me, It's Torture |work=Vanity Fair |date=1 August 2008 |accessdate=1 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vfwaterboardvideo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/video/2008/hitchens_video200808 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809003051/http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/video/2008/hitchens_video200808 |title=Video: On the Waterboard|archivedate=9 August 2011|work=Vanity Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, he joined with four other individuals and four organizations, including the [[ACLU]] and [[Greenpeace]], as plaintiffs in a lawsuit, ''[[ACLU v.

==Critiques of specific individuals==
Hitchens wrote book-length biographical essays on [[Thomas Jefferson]] (''[[Thomas Jefferson: Author of America]]''), [[Thomas Paine]] (''[[Thomas Paine's "Rights of Man": A Biography]]'') and [[George Orwell]] (''[[Why Orwell Matters]]''). He also became known for his excoriating critiques of public contemporary figures including Mother Teresa, Bill Clinton and Henry Kissinger, the subjects of three full-length texts:  ''[[The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice]]'', ''[[No One Left to Lie To: The Triangulations of William Jefferson Clinton]]'', and ''[[The Trial of Henry Kissinger]]'' respectively. In 2007, while promoting his book ''[[God Is Not Great|God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything]]'', Hitchens described the Christian evangelist [[Billy Graham]] as "a self-conscious fraud" and "a disgustingly evil man". Hitchens claimed that the evangelist, who had recently been hospitalized for intestinal bleeding, made a living by "going around spouting lies to young people. What a horrible career. I gather it's soon to be over. I certainly hope so."

In response to the comments, writers [[Nancy Gibbs]] and [[Michael Duffy (American journalist)|Michael Duffy]] published an article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' in which, among other things, they refuted Hitchens's suggestion that Graham went into ministry to make money. They argued that during his career Graham 'turn[ed] down million-dollar television and Hollywood offers'. They also pointed out that having established the [[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association]] in 1950, Graham drew a straight salary, comparable to that of a senior minister, irrespective of the money raised by his meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ni/2007/09/a_disgustingly_evil_man.html|title= Will &amp; Testament: "A disgustingly evil man ..."|last=Crawley|first=William|language=en|publisher=BBC|access-date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of religion==
{{See also|God Is Not Great}}

Hitchens was an [[antitheist]], and said that a person "could be an atheist and wish that belief in God were correct", but that "an antitheist, a term I'm trying to get into circulation, is someone who is relieved that there's no evidence for such an assertion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516100646/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/books/nothing_sacred.html |title=Nothing sacred – Journalist and provocateur Christopher Hitchens picks a fight with God |accessdate=2 May 2014 |first=Andre |last=Mayer |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=14 May 2007 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/books/nothing_sacred.html |archivedate=16 May 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He often spoke against the [[Abrahamic religions]]. In a 2010 interview at [[New York Public Library]], Hitchens stated that he was against infant [[religious male circumcision|circumcision]]. When asked by readers of ''[[The Independent]]'' (London) what he considered to be the "axis of evil", Hitchens replied "Christianity, Judaism, Islam—the three leading monotheisms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/christopher-hitchens-you-ask-the-questions-9242892.html |title=Christopher Hitchens: You ask the questions |work=The Independent |location=London |date=6 March 2002 |accessdate=1 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his bestseller ''God Is Not Great'', Hitchens expanded his criticism to include all religions, including those rarely criticised by Western secularists, such as [[Buddhism]] and [[neo-paganism]].
Hitchens said that organised religion is "the main source of hatred in the world", calling it "[v]iolent, irrational, intolerant, allied to racism, tribalism, and bigotry, invested in ignorance and hostile to free inquiry, contemptuous of women and coercive toward children: [it] ought to have a great deal on its conscience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |url=http://onegoodmove.org/1gm/1gmarchive/2007/03/free_speech_6.html |title=Free Speech |publisher=Onegoodmove |date=1 March 2007 |accessdate=1 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212073345/http://onegoodmove.org/1gm/1gmarchive/2007/03/free_speech_6.html |archivedate=12 February 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens therefore says in ''God Is Not Great'' that humanity is in need of a renewed [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything |publisher=Twelve Books |date=May 2007 |location=New York |page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book received mixed responses, ranging from praise in ''[[The New York Times]]'' for his "logical flourishes and conundrums"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Kinsley |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/books/review/Kinsley-t.html |title=In god, Distrust |work=[[The New York Times Book Review]] |date=13 May 2007 |accessdate=1 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to accusations of "intellectual and moral shabbiness" in the ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/6afa3a28-1ecd-11dc-bc22-000b5df10621.html |title=Here's the hitch |first=Michael |last=Skapinker|authorlink= Michael Skapinker |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=22 June 2007 |accessdate=30 June 2007 |subscription=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702204245/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/6afa3a28-1ecd-11dc-bc22-000b5df10621.html |archivedate=2 July 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''God Is Not Great'' was nominated for a [[National Book Award]] on 10 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Hillel |last=Italie |url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/article/20071014/ENTERTAIN/710140312 |title=The Associated Press: Hitchens Among Book Award Finalists |agency=Associated Press |date=14 October 2007 |accessdate=1 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''God Is Not Great'' affirmed Hitchens's position in the "[[New Atheism]]" movement. Hitchens was made an Honorary Associate of the [[Rationalist International]] and the [[National Secular Society]] shortly after its release, and he was later named to the Honorary Board of distinguished achievers of the [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Staff |url=http://www.secularism.org.uk/patrickharviemsp1.html |title=Honorary Associate: Christopher Hitchens | work=National Secular Society |accessdate=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ffrf.org/news/releases/honorary-ffrf-board-announced/|title=Honorary FFRF Board Announced|accessdate=20 August 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217052917/http://ffrf.org/news/releases/honorary-ffrf-board-announced/|archivedate=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also joined the advisory board of the [[Secular Coalition for America]], a group of atheists and humanists.&lt;ref name="SCfA" /&gt; Hitchens said he would accept an invitation from any religious leader who wished to debate with him. On 30 September 2007, [[Richard Dawkins]], Hitchens, [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], and [[Daniel Dennett]] met at Hitchens's residence for a private, unmoderated discussion that lasted two hours. The event was videotaped and titled "[[New Atheism#Prominent figures|The Four Horsemen]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://richarddawkins.net/2013/10/the-four-horsemen-dvd-19-95/ |title=The Four Horsemen DVD |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |date=1 October 2013 |website=Richard Dawkins Foundation |language=en-US |access-date=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Hitchens stated at one point that he considered the [[Maccabean Revolt]] the most unfortunate event in human history due to the reversion from [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic thought and philosophy]] to [[messianism]] and [[fundamentalism]] that its success constituted.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube | n7IHU28aR2E }}. Approximately 112 minutes in, Hitchens contends, 'The moment where everything went wrong is the moment when the Jewish hellenists were defeated by the Jewish messiahs, the celebration now benignly known as Hanukkah.'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hitchens, [http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2007/12/bah_hanukkah.html "Bah, Hanukkah"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 3 December 2007: "As a consequence of the successful Maccabean revolt against Hellenism, so it is said, a puddle of olive oil that should have lasted only for one day managed to burn for eight days. Wow! Certain proof, not just of an Almighty, but of an Almighty with a special fondness for fundamentalists."&lt;/ref&gt;

That year, Hitchens began a series of written debates on the question "Is Christianity Good for the World?" with Christian theologian and pastor [[Douglas Wilson (theologian)|Douglas Wilson]], published in ''[[Christianity Today]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2007/mayweb-only/119-12.0.html |title=Is Christianity Good for the World? Christopher Hitchens and Douglas Wilson debate |publisher=Christianity Today |date=8 May 2007 |accessdate=1 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This exchange eventually became a book with the same title published in 2008. During their promotional tour of the book, they were accompanied by the producer [[Darren Doane]]'s film crew. Thence Doane produced the film ''[[Collision (2009 film)|Collision]]: Is Christianity GOOD for the World?,'' which was released on 27 October 2009. On 4 April 2009, Hitchens debated [[William Lane Craig]] on the existence of God at [[Biola University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Stan |last=Guthrie |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2009/april/hitchens-vs-craig-round-two.html |title=Hitchens vs. Caig: Round Two |publisher=Christianity Today |date=6 April 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 October 2009, [[Intelligence Squared]] explored the question "Is the Catholic Church a force for good in the world?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB126046645081385887|first=Helen|last=Kirwan-Taylor|title=For the sake of argument|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=11 December 2009|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Onaiyekan]] and [[Ann Widdecombe]] argued that it was, while Hitchens joined [[Stephen Fry]] in arguing that it was not. The latter side won the debate according to an audience poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.newhumanist.org.uk/2009/10/fry-hitch-v-catholic-church.html|title=Fry &amp; Hitch v the Catholic Church|publisher=New Humanist|date=20 October 2009|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 November 2010, Hitchens appeared in Toronto, Ontario, at the [[Munk Debates]], where he debated religion with former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], a convert to [[Roman Catholicism]]. Blair argued religion is a force for good, while Hitchens argued against that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hitchens-apparent-winner-in-religion-debate-1.930421 |title=Hitchens apparent winner in religion debate |newspaper=[[CBC News]] |date=27 November 2010 |accessdate=26 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout these debates, Hitchens became known for his use of persuasive and enthusiastic [[rhetoric]] in [[public speaking]]. "Wit and eloquence", "verbal barbs and linguistic dexterity" and "self-reference, literary engagement and hyperbole" are all elements of his speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/10/16/he-knew-he-was-right-2|title=He knew he was right|first=Ian|last=Parker|publisher=The New Yorker|date=16 October 2006|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/hitchens-cleared-space-for-real-debate/article4247740/|title=Hitchens cleared space for real debate|first=Doug|last=Sanders|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=16 December 2011|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hitch-slap"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/189249-antitheism-and-the-art-of-the-hitch-slap-2495575192.html|title=Antitheism and the art of the "Hitch Slap"|first=Iain|last=Ellis|publisher=Pop Matters|date=21 January 2015|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Hitch-slap" has come about as an informal term among his supporters for a carefully crafted remark designed to humiliate his opponents.&lt;ref name="hitch-slap" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/z44zj3/free-speaking-and-listening-remembering-when-censorship-got-hitchslapped|title=A Remembered 'Hitchslap' For The Worst Censors of All, Ourselves|first=Janus|last=Kopfstein|publisher=Vice|date=18 December 2011|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens's line "one asks wistfully if there is no provision in the procedures of military justice for them to be taken out and shot", condemning the perpetrators of the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]], was cited by ''[[The Humanist]]'' as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thehumanist.com/magazine/july-august-2012/features/prick-the-bubbles-pass-the-mantle-hitchens-as-orwells-successor|first=Anthony|last=Lock|title=Prick the Bubbles, Pass the Mantle: Hitchens as Orwell's Successor |publisher=The Humanist|date=29 June 2012|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tribute in ''[[Politico]]'' stated that this was a trait Hitchens shared with fellow atheist and intellectual, [[Gore Vidal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2012/08/gore-vidal-gentleman-bitch-067223|first1=Jed|last1=Lipinski|first2=Tom|last2=McGeveran|title=Gore Vidal, gentleman bitch|publisher=Politico|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:HitchensTalk.JPG|thumb|Hitchens after a talk at [[The College of New Jersey]] in March 2009]]
Hitchens was raised nominally Christian and attended Christian boarding schools, but from an early age he declined to participate in communal prayers. Later in life, Hitchens discovered that he was of Jewish descent on his mother's side and that his Jewish-born ancestors were immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]] (including [[Poland]]).&lt;ref name=Barber-2002/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |year=2010 |title=Hitch-22: A Memoir |publisher=Twelve |isbn=978-0-446-54033-9 |page=352 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Karaite-Korner.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://karaite-korner.org/karaite_faq.shtml |title=Karaite FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions About Karaism |accessdate=1 May 2005 }} In the [[Tanakh]] itself, Jewishness is traced primarily patrilineally. Thus, Dorothy Levin would be considered a Patrilineal Jew and a ''Levit''—that is, a Levite woman. But her children would be considered only [[gentiles]] of Jewish descent.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hitchens was married twice, first to Eleni Meleagrou,&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/arts/christopher-hitchens-is-dead-at-62-obituary.html?pagewanted=all |title=Christopher Hitchens, Polemicist Who Slashed All, Freely, Dies at 62 |first=William |last=Grimes |publisher=New York Times |date=16 December 2011 |accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Greek Cypriots|Greek Cypriot]] in 1981; the couple had a son, Alexander, and a daughter, Sophia. In 1991, Hitchens married his second wife, Carol Blue, an American screenwriter,&lt;ref name="The Boy Can't Help It"/&gt; in a ceremony held at the apartment of Victor Navasky, editor of ''The Nation.'' They had a daughter together, Antonia.&lt;ref name="The Boy Can't Help It"/&gt;

In November 1973, Hitchens's mother committed suicide in [[Athens]] in a pact with her lover, a defrocked clergyman named Timothy Bryan.&lt;ref name="Hitch-22 Independent"/&gt; The pair overdosed on sleeping pills in adjoining hotel rooms, and Bryan slashed his wrists in the bathtub. Hitchens flew alone to Athens to recover his mother's body, initially under the impression that she had been murdered. Both her children were then independent adults.

===Reactions to death===
[[File:Hitchens Blair.jpg|alt=|thumb|Former British prime minister Tony Blair and Hitchens at the Munk debate on religion, Toronto, November 2010]]
Former British prime minister [[Tony Blair]] said, "Christopher Hitchens was a complete one-off, an amazing mixture of writer, journalist, polemicist, a unique character. He was fearless in the pursuit of truth and any cause in which he believed. And there was no belief he held that he did not advocate with passion, commitment, and brilliance. He was an extraordinary, compelling, and colourful human being whom it was a privilege to know."&lt;ref name="WTimes"&gt;{{cite news |last=Staff |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/dec/16/quotes-on-the-death-of-pundit-christopher-hitchens/ |title=Quotes on the death of pundit Christopher Hitchens |agency=Associated Press |date=16 December 2011 |accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Dawkins]], a friend of Hitchens, said, "I think he was one of the greatest orators of all time. He was a polymath, a wit, immensely knowledgeable, and a valiant fighter against all tyrants, including imaginary supernatural ones."&lt;ref name="WTimes"/&gt;

American [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] and [[cosmologist]] [[Lawrence Krauss]] said, "Christopher was a beacon of knowledge and light in a world that constantly threatens to extinguish both. He had the courage to accept the world for just what it is and not what he wanted it to be. That's the highest praise, I believe, one can give to any intellect. He understood that the universe doesn't care about our existence or welfare, and he epitomized the realization that our lives have meaning only to the extent that we give them meaning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Lawrence |last=Krauss |authorlink= Laurence Krauss|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/644326-remembering-christopher-hitchens |date=23 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424194902/http://richarddawkins.net/articles/644326-remembering-christopher-hitchens |title=Remembering Christopher Hitchens |archivedate=24 April 2012 |publisher=richarddawkins.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atheistfoundation.org.au/lawrence-krauss-tribute-to-christopher-hitchens/ |title=Transcript of Lawrence Krauss' tribute to Christopher Hitchens |year=2012 |publisher=atheistfoundation.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Maher]] paid tribute to Hitchens on his show ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', saying, "We lost a hero of mine, a friend, and one of the great talk show guests of all time."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'' Season 10, episode 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salman Rushdie]] and English comedian [[Stephen Fry]] paid tribute at the Christopher Hitchens Vanity Fair Memorial 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/dec/16/christopher-hitchens-tributes |title=Christopher Hitchens: tributes and reactions |first=Alison |last=Flood |work=The Guardian |date=16 December 2011 |accessdate=28 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2012/04/christopher-hitchens-memorial-vanity-fair |title=Christopher Hitchens's Memorial: Sean Penn, Martin Amis, Salman Rushdie, and Others Pay Tribute |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=20 April 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Staff |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16226580 |title=Tributes paid to journalist Christopher Hitchens |date=16 December 2011 |accessdate=28 April 2016 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/20/christopher-hitchens-memorial-new-york |title=Christopher Hitchens' wit and warmth remembered as New York pays tribute |first=Ed |last=Pilkington |work=The Guardian |date=20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks before Hitchens's death, [[George Eaton (journalist)|George Eaton]] of the ''New Statesman'' wrote, "He is determined to ensure that he is not remembered simply as a 'lefty who turned right' or as a contrarian and provocateur. Throughout his career, he has retained a commitment to the Enlightenment values of reason, secularism and pluralism. His targets—Mother Teresa, Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger, God—are chosen not at random, but rather because they have offended one or more of these principles.

The concept of '''cognitive justice''' is based on the recognition of the plurality of [[knowledge]] and expresses the right of the different forms of knowledge to co-exist.&lt;ref&gt;Shiv Visvanathan (2009). “[http://www.india-seminar.com/2009/597/597_shiv_visvanathan.htm The search for cognitive justice]”. Retrieved January 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Indian scholar [[Shiv Visvanathan]] coined the term cognitive justice in his 1997 book “A Carnival for Science: Essays on science, technology and development”.&lt;ref&gt;Visvanathan, Shiv (1997). “A Carnival for Science: Essays on science, technology and development”. London: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the destructive impact of [[hegemonic]] Western science on [[developing countries]] and non-Western cultures, Visvanathan calls for the recognition of alternative sciences or non-Western forms of knowledge. He argues that different knowledges are connected with different livelihoods and lifestyles and should therefore be treated equally.

Cognitive justice is a critique on the dominant paradigm of modern science&lt;ref&gt;Santos, Boaventura de Sousa (ed) (2007). “Cognitive Justice in a Global World: Prudent knowledges for a decent life”. Lanham: Lexington&lt;/ref&gt; and promotes the recognition of alternative paradigms or alternative sciences by facilitating and enabling dialogue between, often [[Commensurability (ethics)|incommensurable]], knowledges. These dialogues of knowledge are perceived as contributing to a more sustainable, equitable, and democratic world. 

The call for cognitive justice is found in a growing variety of fields, such as [[ethnobiology]],&lt;ref&gt;Augusto, Geri (2008). “[https://courses.washington.edu/info200e/readings/augusto_digitizing_iks.pdf  Digitizing IKS: Epistemic complexity, datadiversity &amp; cognitive justice]”. Retrieved January 7, 2011. In The International Information &amp; Library Review
vol. 40, no. 4, pp. 211-218. Retrieved on January 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; technology and [[database design]],&lt;ref&gt;van der Velden, Maja (2009), “[http://www.globalagenda.org/file/13 Design for a Common World: On Ethical agency and cognitive justice]”. Retrieved January 7, 2011. In Ethics and Information Technology, vol. 11, no. 1, pp. 37 - 47&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Information and communication technology for development (ICT4D)]].&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Katherine (2010). “[http://openict4d.wikidot.com/from-ict4d-to-cognitive-justice From ICT4D to Cognitive Justice: Designing Research for Open Development]”. Retrieved on January 7, 2011
&lt;/ref&gt;

South-African scholar and UNESCO education expert [[Odora Hoppers]] proposes cognitive justice in the field of education.&lt;ref&gt;Odora Hoppers, Catherine A. (2009). “Education, culture and society in a globalizing world: implications for comparative and international education”. In Compare: A Journal of Comparative and International Education, vol. 39, no. 5, pp. 601 - 614&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that Indigenous knowledges have to be included in the dialogues of knowledge without having to fit in the structures and standards of Western knowledge. When Indigenous knowledges are treated equally, they can play their role in making a more democratic and dialogical science, which remains connected to the livelihoods and survival of all cultures.

'''''Dalai Lama Renaissance''''' is a 2007 feature-length [[documentary film]], produced and directed by [[Khashyar Darvich]], and narrated by actor [[Harrison Ford]]. The film documents the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]]'s meeting with the self-titled "Synthesis" group, made up of 40 Western "renaissance" thinkers who hope to use the meeting to change the world and resolve many of the world's problems. The meeting took place at the Dalai Lama's home in [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]], [[India]] in September, 1999.

The film won 12 awards, was the official selection in over 40 international film festivals, and played in cinemas in over 100 cities in the U.S., as well as other countries in the world like Germany, Austria, Switzerland.

It was also released in theaters in Taiwan in June 2009. The film received positive front page Chinese language press in Taiwan. However, ''[[The People's Daily]]'' presented an article criticizing the film.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prweb.com/releases/Dalai/Lama/prweb2690094.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Western thinkers who meet the Dalai Lama are: quantum physicist [[Fred Alan Wolf]], social scientist [[Jean Houston]], and founder of [[Agape International Spiritual Center]] church in [[Los Angeles]], Dr. [[Michael Beckwith]].

Through the film the audience sees the clash of egos that soon developed among the members of the group and their assistants, as each member attempts to mold the meeting to fit their own personal expectations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Ultimately they discover they cannot hope to change the world until they undergo a personal transformation. Assisted by the often light-hearted musings of the Dalai Lama, each member comes away uniquely changed by their experience.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The film includes original music by [[Tibetan musician]]s.

In 2014 Wakan Films released the Poetic ReVision and Director's Cut of ''Dalai Lama Renaissance.'' Entitled ''[[Dalai Lama Awakening]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Darvich|first=Khashyar|title=Dalai Lama Awakening|date=2014-10-01|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3325392/?ref_=ttexrv_exrv_tt|accessdate=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the film contains over 30 minutes of additional footage and a completely new score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newthoughtcsl.org/community/events/dalai-lama-awakening-poetic-revision|title=DALAI LAMA AWAKENING (A Poetic ReVision) {{!}} New Thought Center For Spiritual Living|website=www.newthoughtcsl.org|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Bloor''' ({{IPAc-en|b|l|ʊər}}; born 1942) is a British sociologist. He is a professor in, and a former director of, the Science Studies Unit at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. He is a key figure in the [[sociology of scientific knowledge|Edinburgh School]] and played a major role in the development of the field of [[Science and Technology Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Bruno Latour |last=Latour |first=B. |year=1999 |title='For Bloor and Beyond' – a reply to David Bloor's 'Anti-Latour' |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=113–129 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for advocating the [[Strong Programme]] in the [[Sociology of Scientific Knowledge]], most notably in his book ''Knowledge and Social Imagery''.

==Biography==

He was born in [[Derby]]. He started his academic career in philosophy and [[psychology]]. In 1972 he was awarded a PhD by the University of Edinburgh for his thesis "Speech and the regulation of behaviour."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=C.|first=Bloor, David|year=1972|title=Speech and the regulation of behaviour|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1842/22721}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s he and [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]] were the major figures of the [[strong programme]], which put forward queries against ''philosophical [[a priorism]]'' in the understanding of scientific knowledge. This is an approach, popular in the philosophy of science, that simply precluded inquiries about science by treating successful scientific knowledge as simply true or rational without empirically investigating how such knowledge has come to be accepted as true or rational. Bloor's book ''Knowledge and Social Imagery'' (Routledge, 1976) is one of the key texts of the [[strong programme]].

Bloor wrote extensively on the [[T. S. Kuhn|Kuhn]]/[[Karl Popper|Popper]] debate, and is a representative figure of the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]]. In the 1980s when French scholars like [[Bruno Latour]] developed the [[actor-network theory]] (partially based on the strong programme), David Bloor strongly disagreed with the ANT camp when they argued that human and non-humans should be treated in an equivalent manner, going so far as to write an article entitled "Anti-Latour".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bloor|first=David|year=1999|title=Anti-Latour|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/BLOA-5|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A|volume=30|issue=1|pages=81–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded the [[John Desmond Bernal Prize]] by the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]] in 1996 in recognition of his distinguished contribution to the field.&lt;ref&gt;List of winners of the John Desmond Bernal Prize http://www.4sonline.org/prizes/bernal&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emily''' was a [[cow]] who escaped from a [[slaughterhouse]] in [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts|Hopkinton]], [[Massachusetts]], by jumping a gate and wandered for 40 days eluding capture. She found lasting refuge at "Peace Abbey" in [[Sherborn, Massachusetts|Sherborn]], Massachusetts, until her death in 2003. During her 8 years' stay in the abbey, the cow became a figurehead of [[animal rights]] and a [[vegetarianism|meat-free diet]].

The "Sacred Cow Animal Rights Memorial" was built on her grave with a life-sized statue of her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emily the Cow Ran Away From the Slaughterhouse And Became a Star|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/emily-the-cow-ran-away-from-the-slaughterhouse-and-became-a-star|website=Atlas Obscura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In record amounts of snow, Emily was spotted foraging through backyards for food. It was said that local townspeople helped the cow evade capture for 40 days. Oftentimes, she was seen running with a herd of deer, which report made headlines in local newspapers.

==Life at the Peace Abbey==
The cow was later purchased from the slaughterhouse by  the Randa family, who brought Emily to live in sanctuary at the Peace Abbey on Christmas Eve.&lt;ref name="SCM_SacredCowMemorial"&gt;{{cite journal

==Death and memorial==
As a side effect of [[rBGH]], Emily suffered from [[uterine cancer]]&lt;ref name="CounterPunch_ResistanceIsNeverFutile"/&gt; and died on March 30, 2003. A week before her death, Emily was visited and blessed by a local [[Hindu]] priest named Krishna Bhatta of the [[Lakshmi]] Temple in [[Ashland, Massachusetts]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.srilakshmi.org/ Sri Lakshmi Temple in Ashland, Massachusetts]&lt;/ref&gt;, who placed a golden thread around her leg and one through the hole in her ear that once held the number tag when she arrived at the slaughterhouse.&lt;ref name="SCM_SacredCowMemorial"/&gt;

Emily was buried at Peace Abbey on April 2, 2003, between statues of [[Mother Teresa]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Meg and Lewis Randa commissioned artist Lado Goudjabidze to sculpt a life-sized [[bronze]] statue of Emily, adorned with a blanket and flowers, Hindu signs of respect, to stand above her grave. The statue was unveiled on [[Earth Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After Emily's death, hair clippings from her markings on the forehead and from the tail tip, traces of her blood, and a piece of golden thread placed through her ear by the Hindu priest were released into river [[Ganges]] at [[Benares]], [[India]], in April 2003.&lt;ref name="PeaceAbbey_EmilyTheSacredCow"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6512">'''Epistemic conservatism''' is a view in [[epistemology]] about the structure of reasons or [[justification (epistemology)|justification]] for [[belief]]. While there are various forms, epistemic conservatism is generally the view that a person's believing some claim is a reason in support of the claim, at least on the face of it.&lt;ref&gt;Fumerton (2007), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Others formulate epistemic conservatism as the view that one is, to some degree, justified in believing something simply because one believes it.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen (1994), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Expanding the thesis, epistemic conservatism implies that it is unreasonable to revise or alter our personal beliefs and ideologies without good reasons to do so. This action of revising would cause an unnecessary use of resources/energy by the individual, and it would not offer the individual any epistemic value. Epistemic conservatism sees an epistemic value in just holding one’s beliefs stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vahid|first=Hamid|date=2004|title=Varieties of Epistemic Conservatism|jstor=20118469|journal=Synthese|volume=141|issue=1|pages=97–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been some critics of the thesis but several important methodologies assume that this thesis holds true.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCain|first=Kevin|date=2008-09-01|title=The virtues of epistemic conservatism|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-007-9222-5|journal=Synthese|language=en|volume=164|issue=2|pages=185–200|doi=10.1007/s11229-007-9222-5|issn=0039-7857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kevin McCain's Epistemic Conservatism ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;‘Properly Formulated Epistemic Conservatism’ (PEC): “If S believes that p and p is not incoherent, then S is justified in retaining the belief that p and S remains justified in believing that p so long as p is not defeated for S.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Defeat Condition 1 (DC1): If S has better reasons for believing that ∼ p than S’s reasons for believing that p, then S is no longer justified in believing that p.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Defeat Condition 2 (DC2): If S has reasons for believing that∼p which are as good as S’s reasons for believing that p and the belief that ∼p coheres equally as well or better than the belief that p does with S’s other beliefs, then S is no longer justified in believing that p.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This above thesis hits upon several common themes when discussing epistemic conservatism. PEC addresses the idea that when revising a belief system, individuals would seek to correct the errors piece by piece, rather than completely overhauling their ideologies. In other words, it is ideal to hold on to as many original beliefs as possible.Furthermore, PEC addresses spontaneous beliefs based on memories. It is hard to justify memory beliefs given that they are not drawn through distinct experiences, but regardless if they are/aren’t supported, individuals would still have the intuition that they are justified in holding these beliefs. According to PEC, as long as a specific memory belief is not defeated for the individual, the individual would be justified in holding this belief in virtue of previously holding the memory belief. As for forgotten evidence, PEC also makes sense of this phenomenon. An example would be where someone learned about relativity theory and came to hold the belief “E=mc^2”. After a long time, this person might have lost evidence supporting this specific belief, but we are intuitively drawn to claiming that they are still justified. PEC allows for this because the individual is justified in holding “E=mc^2” because they hold that belief.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Criticisms of Epistemic Conservatism ==

=== Richard Foley's Criticism ===
In his objections, Foley describes a situation where epistemic conservatism makes irrational beliefs rational, where a contradiction exists. In his example, an individual believes “x”, however they possess better reasons to believe “~x”. In terms of PEC, the individual is justified in believing “x” as long as “x” is not defeated for them. In Foley’s example, “x” is defeated for the individual so Defeat Condition 1 was met, thus PEC leads to the individual not being justified in believing “x”, thus no contradiction exists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foley|first=Richard|date=1983|title=Epistemic Conservatism|jstor=4319585|journal=Philosophical Studies|volume=43|issue=2|pages=165–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Richard Feldman's "Lefty-Righty" Case ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Detective Jones has definitively narrowed down the suspects in a crime to two individuals, Lefty and Righty. There are good reasons to think that Lefty did it, but there are equally good reasons to think that Righty did it. There is conclusive reason to think that no one other than Lefty or Righty did it.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50960890|title=Epistemology|last=1948-|first=Feldman, Richard,|date=2003|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0133416453|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|oclc=50960890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In this example, Feldman questions what Detective Jones would do in the situation, as the intuition points out that Jones can not believe that Righty did the crime and Lefty did not and vice versa. He supposes that Jones came upon the belief that Lefty did it first, possibly getting Lefty’s evidence first. Feldman draws the conclusion that epistemic conservatism forces our intuition away, forcing us to have Jones believe that Lefty did it. However, PEC allows for this because Jones’s belief that Lefty is the culprit is defeated since he now has equal evidence to believe that Righty committed the crime. By having the two equal beliefs of “Lefty is the culprit” and “Righty is the culprit”, Defeat Condition 2 was met. With PEC, Jones should withhold his belief from either of the two, thus PEC does not disagree with our natural intuitions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2781">'''Ermine Cowles Case''' (1871&amp;ndash;1953), invariably known as '''E.C. Case''', was a prominent American [[paleontologist]] in the second generation that succeeded [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] and [[Edward Drinker Cope]]. A graduate of the [[University of Kansas]], with a PhD from the [[University of Chicago]] (1896),&lt;ref&gt;''Alumni Directory'', the University of Chicago, 1919&lt;/ref&gt;  Case became a paleontologist of international stature while working at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2005AM/finalprogram/abstract_92060.htm Robert H. Dott, Jr, "Ermine Cowles Case: Turn of the century master of Permo-Carboniferous terrestrial life" (Geological Societyof America 2005 Annual Meeting (Salt Lake City , October 2005)].&lt;/ref&gt;
He was a Member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] (1931).

Case began by sorting out some of the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] synonymies and other puzzles created by the "[[Bone Wars]]" of the two giants of the heroic age of [[dinosaur]]-hunting in the American West, in a series of three monographs dealing with the vertebrates of the Permian or Permo-Carboniferous of North America.  Case then turned to his lifelong interest in filling in the [[fossil record]] of [[Permian]] and [[Carboniferous]] [[vertebrate]]s from the '[[Red Beds of Texas and Oklahoma|Red Beds]]' of Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.  He also made extensive [[Jurassic]] collections at [[Como Bluff]], Wyoming, in the [[Cretaceous]] deposits in Kansas, and Cenozoic formations of the [[Green River Basin]] and the [[Badlands National Park|Badlands of South Dakota]]. Among Case's prolific output several great monographs about Permo-Carboniferous vertebrates stand out: ''Revision of the Amphibia and Pisces of the Permian of North America'' (1911)), ''The Permo-Carboniferous Red Reds of North America and their Vertebrate Fauna'' (1915), ''The Environment of Vertebrate Life in the Late Paleozoic in North America, a paleographic study'' (1919) and ''Environment of Tetrapod Life in the Late Paleozoic of Regions Other than North America'' (1926). All were published by the Carnegie Institution, Washington DC.&lt;ref&gt;Dott 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Case was a gifted teacher. The Ermine Cowles Case Collegiate Professor of Paleontology is an endowed chair at the University of Michigan, which conserves Case's extensive collections. The Ermine Cowles Case Memorial Lecture is given there annually.

The '''Five Houses of Chán''' (also called the '''Five Houses of Zen''') were the five major schools of [[Chan Buddhism]] that originated during [[Tang dynasty|Tang China]].  Although at the time they were not considered formal [[School of thought|schools]] or [[sects]] of Buddhism, they are now regarded as important schools in the history of Chán Buddhism.  Most Chán [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineages]] throughout Asia and the rest of the world originally grew from or were heavily influenced by the original five houses of Chán.

==East Mountain Teaching==
[[File:Huineng-tearing-sutras.svg|thumb|right|100px|Huineng tearing sutras]]
{{Main|East Mountain Teaching}}

The period of [[Daoxin]] ({{lang|zh|道信}} 580–651) and [[Daman Hongren]] ({{lang|zh|弘忍}} 601–674) came to be called the [[East Mountain Teaching]], due to the location of the residence of Hongren at Huamgmei. The term was used by Shenxiu, the most important successor to Hongren.{{sfn|McRae|2003|pp=33–36}}

[[Yuquan Shenxiu|Shenxiu]] (神秀 606?–706) was the most important successor to Hongren. In 701 he was invited to the Imperial Court by Empress Wu, who paid him due imperial reverence. The first lineage documents were produced in this period.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=48}}

According to tradition, the sixth and last ancestral founder, [[Huineng]] (惠能; 638–713), was one of the giants of Chán history, and all surviving schools regard him as their ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wuys.com/news/Article_Show.asp?ArticleID=1276 禅宗研究一百年]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shenhui]], a successor to Huineng claimed Huineng to be the successor of Hongren's, instead of the then publicly recognized successor Shenxiu.{{sfn|McRae|2003}} The most prominent of the successors of Shenhui's lineage was [[Guifeng Zongmi]]{{sfn|Yampolski|2003-A|p=9}}

Shenhui's influence is traceable in the [[Platform Sutra]], which gives a popular account of the story of Huineng, but also reconciles the antagonism created by Shenhui. Shenhui himself does not figure in the Platform Sutra; he was effectively written out of Chán-history.{{sfn|MacRae|2003|p=63}}

From the East Mountain Teachings descend the Five Houses of Chán, via various lineages.

{{Zen Lineage Hongren Huineng}}

==The Five Houses==
The five houses were each defined by a unique method of teaching.  Each school's methods were significantly different from the others, though it was not unheard of for teachers from one school to use the methods of another.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt;

===Guiyang school===
{{main|Guiyang school}}
The Guiyang school (潙仰宗 Guíyáng, Jpn. Igyō) was the first established school of the Five Houses of Zen.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ferguson |first1=Andrew E. |title=Zen's Chinese Heritage: The Masters and Their Teachings |url= |year=2000 |publisher=Wisdom Publications |location=Somerville MA |isbn=0-86171-163-7 |pages=126–127}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 October 2011 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Guiyang is named after master Guishan Lingyou (771–854) (Kuei-shan Ling-yu, Jpn. Isan Reiyū) and his student, Yangshan Huiji (807-883,{{sfn|Koole|1997|p=207}} or 813–890) (Yang-shan Hui-chi, Jpn. Kyōzan Ejaku).

Guishan was a disciple of [[Baizhang Huaihai]], the Chinese Zen master whose disciples included [[Huangbo Xiyun]] (who in turn taught [[Línjì Yìxuán]], founder of the Linji School).&lt;ref&gt;Ven. Jian Hu. "Buddhism in the Modern World" Stanford University, May 25, 2006, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  After founding the Guiyang School, Yangshan moved his school to what is now modern [[Jiangxi]].

The Guiyang school is distinct from the other schools due to its use of esoteric metaphors and imagery in the school's [[kōan]]s and other teachings.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt;

Over the course of Song Dynasty (960–1279), the Guiyang school, along with the Fayan and Yunmen schools were absorbed into the Linji school. Chán master [[Hsu Yun]], however, attempted to revive absorbed lineages. The attempt was successful regarding the Guiyang school, [[Hsuan Hua]] being its most known modern representative.

===Linji school===
{{Main|Linji school}}

The Linji ({{zh|c=临济宗 |p=Lín jì zōng}}) was named after Chán master Línjì Yìxuán, who was notable for teaching students in ways that included shouting and striking in an attempt to help students [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|reach enlightenment]]. The Linji school is the predominant Chinese Chán school.&lt;ref name="hoofprint"&gt;{{cite book |author=Master Sheng-yen and Dan Stevenson|year=2001 |title=Hoofprint of the Ox: Principles of the Chan Buddhist Path as Taught by a Modern Chinese Master |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e_vCoiGhLGoC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=%22The+Five+Houses+of+Chan%22&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Five%20Houses%20of%20Chan%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caodong school===
{{main|Caodong school}}
The Caodong school was founded by [[Dongshan Liangjie]] and his Dharma-heirs in the 9th century. Some attribute the name "Cáodòng" as a union of "Dongshan" and "Caoshan" from one of his Dharma-heirs, [[Caoshan Benji]]; however, the "Cao" could also have come from ''Cáoxī'' (曹溪), the "mountain-name" of [[Huineng]], the Sixth Ancestor of Chan.  The sect emphasized [[sitting meditation (Zen)|sitting meditation]], and later "[[Shikantaza|silent illumination]]" techniques.

In 826 Korean Seon Master Doui, a student of Sixth Ancestor of Chan Huineng, brought Chan/Seon (Korean Zen)to Korea and founded the "Nine Mountain Seon Monasteries" which adopted the name Jogye order.

In 1227 [[Dōgen Zenji]], a former [[Tendai]] student, studied Caodong Buddhism and returned to [[Japan]] to establish the [[Sōtō]] school. The Caodong school is still a respectable Chinese Chán school and is second only to Linji in number of monks and temples.

===Fayan school===
{{main|Fayan school}}
The Fayan school (法眼宗) was named after Chinese Chán Master [[Fayan Wenyi]] (Fa-yen Wen-i), who lived from 885  to 958.

===Yunmen school===
{{Main|Yunmen Wenyan}}

The Yunmen school was named for [[Yunmen Wenyan]].

==The Five Houses during the Song Dynasty==
Over the course of [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279), the Guiyang, Fayan, and Yunmen houses were gradually absorbed into the Linji house.  Caodong was transmitted to Japan in the 13th century from Ven. [[Rujing]] of [[Tiantong Temple]] to Ven. [[Dōgen]] leading to the creation of the [[Sōtō]] Zen school.

==Chan during the Ming and Qing Dynasty==

==Chan in the modern era==
Both Linji and Caodong are still practiced in China today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_5d7fdaa50101rgfh.html |title=Zhōng guó chán zōng cáo dòng zōng dí fǎ mài chuán chéng |script-title=zh:中国禅宗曹洞宗的法脉传承 |trans-title=Transmission of the Caodong Lineage in China |language=Chinese |authors=Ven.

[[File:Gaetanus Matthew Perez - Dissertazione.jpg|thumb|''Dissertazione Filosofico-Morale sullo Stato Amichevole'' (1776) of Gaetanus Matthew Perez]]

'''Gaetanus Matthew Perez''' (18th century) was a minor Maltese philosopher. His area of specialisation in philosophy was chiefly [[ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. II, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; No portrait of Perez is known to exist so far.

==Life==
Absolutely nothing is yet known about Perez’ personal life.

==Work==
Just one work, and a very interesting one at that, survives from Perez’ hand. It is a publication in Italian which bears the title: '''''Dissertazione Filosofico-Morale sullo Stato Amichevole''''' (A Philosophical-Moral Study on Friendship).&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', Vol. I, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; The work, published in 1776 at the printing press of the [[Knights Hospitallers]] in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]], is made up of only twelve pages. Nevertheless, the content of the study is quite unusual for Perez’ time.

The booklet contains a long epistle addressed to Abbot Joseph Raiberti of Nissa, the Conventual Chaplain of the [[Knights Hospitallers]]. It deals with the value and need of friendship. The writing itself is one long piece of prose without any divisions whatsoever.

First Perez discusses friendship on the level of individuals. This relationship is then explored as a model and foundation of political and social life. Perez makes it quite clear that, to his mind, personal friendship is the essential condition from which peace, justice, and a nation’s progress begin, and on which they are based.

'''George Lokert''' of [[Ayr]] (c. 1485 &amp;ndash; 1547) was a Scottish philosopher and theologian who made significant contributions to the study of [[logic]]. A pupil of [[John Major (philosopher)|John Mair]], he also studied and taught at the University of Paris, and eventually served as prior of [[the Sorbonne]]. Returning to Scotland in 1521, he served as [[Rector of the University of St Andrews]] (1522-5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishphilosophy.org/georgelokert.html|title=George Lokert ?1485-1547|publisher=International Association for Scottish Philosophy|accessdate=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Paris, he was closely associated with [[Noël Béda]].

After his second period in Paris, Lokert served as the provost of Crichton, and dean of the [[University of Glasgow]].

'''Gestalt Practice''' is a contemporary form of personal exploration and integration developed by [[Dick Price]] at the [[Esalen Institute]].&lt;ref name="goldman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldman|first1=Marion|title=The American Soul Rush: Esalen and the Rise of Spiritual Privilege|date=2012|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8147-3287-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt;&lt;ref name=noreligion/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Foreword" ''Manual of Gestalt Practice in the tradition of Dick Price'' - The Gestalt Legacy Project (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the practice is to become more fully aware of the process of living within a unified field of body, mind, relationship, earth and spirit.&lt;ref name=noreligion&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fzSP6BRFBzIC&amp;q=price%20best%20steve%20harper#v=onepage&amp;q=knew%20price%20best%20steve%20harper&amp;f=false|title=Esalen: America and the Religion of No Religion|first=Jeffrey J.|last=Kripal|date=15 April 2007|publisher=University of Chicago Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Gestalt Practice" ''Manual of Gestalt Practice in the tradition of Dick Price'' - The Gestalt Legacy Project (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Gestalt Practice exercise" in: Goldman, Marion S.

''[[:wikt:gestalt|Gestalt]]'' is a German word that denotes form, shape or configuration, and connotes wholeness. Practice is an ongoing program or process of development. Gestalt Practice is an ongoing process of integrating human awareness across a broad spectrum of consciousness.

Initially, Gestalt was used as a psychological term in [[Gestalt psychology]]. Then [[Fritz Perls]], [[Laura Perls]] and [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]] applied it to psychotherapy when they developed [[Gestalt therapy]], upon which Gestalt Practice was partially based.&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt; [[Alan Watts]], who was a mentor of Dick Price, suggested combining practices from the cultures of East and West.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Alan. ''Psychotherapy East and West'', Ballantine Books, New York (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; The writings of [[Nyanaponika Thera]]&lt;ref&gt;Nyanaponika Thera. The Heart of Buddhist Meditation, Buddhist Publication Society, Sri Lanka (1954)&lt;/ref&gt; and the nearby presence of Zen Roshi [[Shunryu Suzuki]]&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Suzuki Roshi was abbot at the [[Tassajara Zen Mountain Center]], near Esalen Institute&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, S. ''Zen Mind, Beginners Mind'', Shambhala Publications (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; were sources of Buddhist meditation practice for Price. Gestalt Practice was the term he used to describe his combination of these Eastern and Western traditions. This term distinguished the practice Price taught from both Gestalt therapy and Buddhist practice.&lt;ref name=noreligion/&gt;{{rp|172}}&lt;ref&gt;"A History of Gestalt Practice" Manual of Gestalt Practice in the tradition of Dick Price - The Gestalt Legacy Project (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice, not therapy==

This form of awareness practice is different from Gestalt therapy,&lt;ref name=upstart&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Walter Truett|title=The Upstart Spring:  Esalen and the American Awakening|date=1983|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Massachusetts|isbn=0-201-11034-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perls, F., R. Hefferline, and P. Goodman. ''Gestalt Therapy: Excitement and Growth in the Human Personality'', Julian Press (1951); Perls, F. ''Gestalt Therapy Verbatim'', Real People Press (1969); Perls, F. ''The Gestalt Approach &amp; Eye Witness to Therapy'', Bantam Books (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; because it is not a “cure” for psychological symptoms, and it relies upon the interaction between two equal partners,&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt; namely an "initiator" of awareness work and a "reflector," rather than a patient and a therapist. Some aspects of Gestalt Practice are derived from the theory of Gestalt therapy. However, as Dick Price conceived of Gestalt Practice, if a "patient" wants to do Gestalt work with a "therapist" then they belong in Gestalt therapy.&lt;ref name="wayoutin"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Kripal|editor-first1=Jeffrey J.|editor-last2=Shuck|editor-first2=Glenn W.|work=On the Edge of the Future: Esalen and the Evolution of American Culture |title=The Only Way Out Is In: The Life of Richard Price|first1=Barclay James |last1=Erickson

''Gestalt Therapy Integrated: Contours of theory and practice''. New York, NY: Brunner-Mazel (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with this approach, eclectic techniques of [[meditation]], physical exercise, [[environmentalism]], [[contemplation]] and spiritual practice are incorporated into Gestalt Practice,&lt;ref name="The Gestalt Legacy Project 2009"&gt;"Meditation and Buddhism" Manual of Gestalt Practice in the tradition of Dick Price - The Gestalt Legacy Project (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; along with some typical Gestalt awareness experiments borrowed from the Gestalt therapy model.

==Inception==

Gestalt Practice is an amalgam of awareness practices.&lt;ref name=noreligion/&gt;{{rp|358–61}} [[Lao Tzu]] was one of the most significant Asian influences on Price.&lt;ref name=noreligion/&gt;{{rp|76}} Otherwise, the primary influences upon the development of Gestalt Practice were Fritz Perls, [[Wilhelm Reich]], Alan Watts, Nyanaponika Thera, Shunryu Suzuki, [[Frederic Spiegelberg]], [[Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)|Rajneesh]], [[Joseph Campbell]], [[Gregory Bateson]], and [[Stanislav Grof]], as well as many other scholars who were in residence at Esalen Institute during the two decades Price's lead the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esalen.org/page/dick-price-interview Interview with Dick Price] Interview conducted by Wade Hudson at Esalen, April, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Price worked with Perls for approximately four years at Esalen, between 1966 and 1970. Then Perls told Price that it was time for him to start teaching Gestalt on his own.&lt;ref name=noreligion/&gt;  Price was impressed with the similarities between Gestalt and [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] meditation, which he used with insights from [[Eastern religions]] and [[Altered state of consciousness|altered state research]] to develop Gestalt Practice.&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt;{{rp|168}}

==Modalities==

Gestalt practitioners teach mindfulness skills, using a wide variety of methods not limited by the psychotherapeutic model.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;For examples of the types of practices that might be used in Gestalt Practice, see Goldman, Marion S. The American Soul Rush: Esalen and the Rise of Spiritual Privilege. New York University Press (2012) Appendix I&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  group=notes&gt;Gestalt Practice techniques are described more fully in Sections 1, 4 &amp; 5, Manual of Gestalt Practice in the tradition of Dick Price - The Gestalt Legacy Project (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; All Gestalt Practice techniques emphasize experience over analysis.  Besides the standard Gestalt exercises that characterized Gestalt therapy, Dick Price widened the approach by incorporating novel techniques from such disciplines as [[meditation]], [[shamanism]], compassion practice and spiritual contemplation.&lt;ref  group=notes&gt;Compare contemporary meditation practices such as [[Mettā]] and [[Tonglen]], typically used in Gestalt Practice, with earlier forms of discourse found in: Perls, F. Gestalt Therapy Verbatim. Moab, UT: Real People Press (1969); Polster, E. &amp; Polster, M. Gestalt Therapy Integrated: Contours of theory and practice, New York, NY: Brunner-Mazel (1973); Stevens, J.O. Awareness: exploring, experimenting, experiencing. Moab, UT: Real People Press( 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Gestalt Practice became a personalized form of consciousness exploration beyond the limits of psychotherapy. A partial list of the modalities used in Gestalt Practice includes the following:

Gestalt Practice work may involve the reporting of present awareness,&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt;{{rp|176}} and the integration of awareness through [[intrapsychic]] dialogue between aspects of personality. This kind of work, borrowed from Gestalt therapy, is often practiced as a shared experiment between two partners working together as a "[[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]]." [[Phenomenology (psychology)|Phenomenological]] techniques like these are based upon the belief that subjective experience is worthy of direct attention, without the interference of preexisting ideas or interpretations.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

[[Somatic psychology|Somatic awareness]] may be the focus of Gestalt exercises.&lt;ref name=noreligion/&gt;{{rp|230}} Awareness of breathing is emphasized because it promotes immediate experience of the body.&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt;{{rp|175}} Dramatic interventions, typical of [[Body psychotherapy|body-oriented Reichian therapy]] or [[Bioenergetics]], generally are not used in Gestalt Practice. However, an initiator’s awareness naturally may be directed toward areas of tension or holding. A scan of body feelings and sensations, similar to forms of [[Buddhist meditation]] can enhance awareness practice. And movement exercises such as [[T'ai chi ch'uan]], [[Yoga]], dance, art, hiking, chanting, singing and [[massage]] may be used to integrate awareness of the body.&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt;{{rp|177}}

[[Interpersonal relationship]] practices may be used in Gestalt Practice to clarify communications, improve relationship skills, and enhance empathy.&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt;{{rp|35}} A neutral moderator may assist with interpersonal encounters, although this is not necessary, in keeping with the Gestalt Practice principle of equality among participants.&lt;ref&gt;"Encounter" Manual of Gestalt Practice in the tradition of Dick Price - The Gestalt Legacy Project (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dreamwork]] is a common Gestalt awareness practice, in which enactment and integration of dream elements are favored. An initiator of Gestalt dreamwork intentionally re-experiences their dream as if it were happening in the present. The initiator then assumes the role of various dream elements, and enters into a dialogue with whatever is encountered in the dream. This approach is borrowed from the Gestalt therapy model.&lt;ref&gt;Perls, F. Gestalt Therapy Verbatim, Real People Press (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in contrast to Gestalt therapy, alternative sources of dream interpretation, including intuitive experiences are welcomed in Gestalt Practice.&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt;{{rp|142}}

[[Meditation]] practices, derived from many different contemplative traditions, may be used by Gestalt practitioners.&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt;{{rp|168}}  [[Buddhism]] provides many useful models for mindfulness and compassion practice; and some of these have been adapted to complement the objectives of Gestalt Practice.&lt;ref name="The Gestalt Legacy Project 2009"/&gt;

[[Taoism]], as it was expressed by Lao Tzu in the [[Tao Te Ching]], provides a non-judgmental backdrop for non-intervention with an initiator’s process, allowing whatever happens in a Gestalt work session to unfold naturally in the present moment. In addition, Taoism reinforces the reverence for nature that is typical of Gestalt Practice.&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

These techniques, and many others beyond the ambit of [[therapy]], are regularly used in Gestalt Practice, with the same objectives of enhanced awareness, spiritual growth,&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt;{{rp|154}} and respect for the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;Roszak, Theodore, M. Gomes and A. Kanner (editors). Ecopsychology: Restoring the Earth, Healing the Mind, Sierra Club Books (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deployment==

Gestalt Practice is most often taught in [[social group|groups]],&lt;ref&gt;"The Dynamics of Small Groups" Manual of Gestalt Practice in the tradition of Dick Price - The Gestalt Legacy Project (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; with an experienced reflector serving as group leader. However, after participants have learned the basics of Gestalt, they frequently choose to do awareness practice work together on their own, outside of a group, without a leader. In this way, a Gestalt Practice group functions as the model for a Gestalt community. Indeed, Gestalt Practice, as  Price conceived it, quickly evolves into a congregational awareness practice that transcends the confines of any meeting room.&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt;{{rp|64}}

Price led Gestalt groups at Esalen for fifteen years until his death in 1985.&lt;ref name="wayoutin"/&gt;{{rp|158–59}} His wife and collaborator at Esalen, Christine Stewart Price, carried on the Gestalt Practice tradition by developing her own form of awareness practice, which she calls Gestalt Awareness Practice or GAP.&lt;ref name=noreligion/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribalground.com/christine-price/ Christine Price] Tribal Ground&lt;/ref&gt; Christine Price now teaches GAP in the United States, Europe and Japan. Christine and Tibetan Buddhist practitioner Gail Stewart&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribalground.com/gailstewartbio/ Gail Stewart]&lt;/ref&gt; also offer [http://www.tribalground.com/workshops/list/ workshops], in which they teach Gestalt Practice methods and theory to experienced practitioners. In 2013, Christine Stewart Price founded a new facility, called [http://www.tribalground.com/welcome/tribal-ground-circle/ Tribal Ground Circle], dedicated to continued teaching and development of the Gestalt Practice legacy.

Gestalt Practice influenced many people at Esalen.&lt;ref name="wayoutin"/&gt;{{rp|160}} Prominent among them was a student of Dick Price named Steven Harper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevenkharper.com/about.html|title=Steven Harper - About Me|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who incorporated aspects of Gestalt Practice, along with principles of [[ecopsychology]], into his own unique wilderness practice.&lt;ref name=noreligion/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stevenkharper.com/ecopsychology.html Ecopsychology and the Way of Wilderness] Steven Harper&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Way of Wilderness'' Steven Harper, in Roszak, Theodore, M. Gomes and A. Kanner (editors). Ecopsychology: Restoring the Earth, Healing the Mind, Sierra Club Books (1995) p.183 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary American forms of psychoanalysis, such as [[relational psychoanalysis]] and [[intersubjective psychoanalysis]], have had an impact upon Gestalt Practice, leading to the development of Relational Gestalt Practice by Dorothy Charles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dorothycharles.com/ Dorothy Charles, Relational Gestalt Practice]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fzSP6BRFBzIC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=dorothy%20charles%20gestalt&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zpw8mouH-a&amp;sig=oZlM6Tdfsya3eQqFb3A8JwFkObo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-yCLTqmjA86EtgeFlPG2Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=dorothy%20charles%20gestalt&amp;f=false|title=Esalen: America and the Religion of No Religion|first=Jeffrey J.|last=Kripal|date=15 April 2007|publisher=University of Chicago Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; She teaches this practice at Esalen, and in Japan, Spain and Greece.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5047">'''HeavyWeight Yoga''' is style of yoga practice designed for obese men and women. The practice uses modifications of yoga's 24 foundational [[Asanas|yoga poses]], accompanied by a customized use of supportive language.&lt;ref name="Pilarzyk"&gt;Pilarzyk, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; HeavyWeight students employ props to support obese and overweight bodies. These props can include blocks, chairs and other devices to accommodate for the extra body weight, weaker joints and diminished strength of the obese. HeavyWeight Yoga's practice uses classroom lessons, yoga teacher training, and instructional DVDs&lt;ref name="mysanantonio"&gt;San Antonio Express-News S.A. Life, September, 2009. ''[http://blog.mysanantonio.com/getfit/2009/09/heavyweight-yoga-revisited/ HeavyWeight Yoga revisited]''&lt;/ref&gt; for overweight and obese people which have been created by the founder of the style, Abby Lentz.

The practice of HeavyWeight Yoga relies upon slower pacing to encourage those who practice it.&lt;ref name="ChangeVision"&gt;http://venusvision.com/abby-lentz-is-out-to-change-the-image-of-yoga/&lt;/ref&gt;  It avoids classic full inversion poses, modifying them so larger people can practice yoga.&lt;ref name="SanAntonio"&gt;San Antonio Express News, Lifestyles, October 6, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; It is also appropriate for beginners of anyone who has a limited range of motion.&lt;ref name="mysanantonio"/&gt;

HeavyWeight Yoga does not include practices which enable students to lose weight. The language of the practice such as "belly well" or "energetic swipe" is designed to create yoga experience for obese people.&lt;ref name="naturalsolutionsmag"&gt;Natural Solutions Magazine, January 1, 2009, [http://www.naturalsolutionsmag.com/balance/mind-body-connection/embrace-your-curves%20 ''Embrace Your Curves'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==

Two unique techniques of HeavyWeight Yoga are movements to help a student regain flexibility.&lt;ref name="weblogs"&gt;The Skinny, Orlando Sun Sentinel, July 16, 2008, [http://weblogs.sun-sentinel.com/features/health/theskinny/blog/2008/07/abby_lentz_gives_tips_on_heavy.html ''Abby Lentz gives tips on HeavyWeight yoga'']&lt;/ref&gt; One of the modifications, the Belly Well, separates the legs to create a space for the body. The modification allows the student to lengthen their spine deeper or more stretch their hamstrings more fully. It can also be combined with an “Energetic Swipe,” which moves the flesh out of the way. This enables an obese yoga student to lower a forward bend or to deepen a twist.   

Modifications in HeavyWeight Yoga have been customized by certified teachers in order to accommodate students recovering from surgeries such as joint replacements.

=== Origins ===

Abby Lentz began practicing yoga in the 1970s. She is a trained Kripalu teacher. Lentz started her yoga teaching practice in 2004 and developed HeavyWeight Yoga the same year.

=== Later development ===

Research by the University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine showed that when a group of obese women over age 50 practiced yoga for eight weeks, each experienced a 39 to 47% reduction in pain and stiffness while treating osteoarthritis in their knees.&lt;ref name="AmericanFitness"&gt;American Fitness, Nov-Dec 2010. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

In the documentary ''[http://www.allofmemovie.com/ All of Me]'', a movie about Weight Loss Surgery patients that aired as part of the PBS Independent Lens series, HeavyWeight Yoga poses are taught in a class of WLS patients to aid in recovery and post-surgical lifestyle. Lentz spoke on a KLRU-TV Civic Summit panel&lt;ref name="CivicSummit"&gt;[http://www.klru.org/episode/civic-summit/obesity-weight-loss-and-body-acceptance] PBS KLRU-TV Civic Summit&lt;/ref&gt; after the movie was broadcast, to explain how yoga affects the obese and overweight student's recovery. The practices of Heavyweight Yoga are a focus of an Independent Lens Short, included with All of Me's documentary's PBS package.

HeavyWeight Yoga instruction is taught to professionals at the Children's Medical Center of Dallas, in support of the hospital's childhood obesity program.

'''INGENIAS''' (Engineering for Software Agents) is an open-source [[software framework]] for the analysis, design and implementation of [[multi-agent systems]] (MAS).&lt;ref name="pavon2003agentOriented"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Model-driven engineering]] (MDE) organizes developments around the specification of systems through models that are automatically transformed to generate other artefacts, e.g., code, tests, or documentation.&lt;ref name="france2007modelDrivenDevelopment"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
INGENIAS follows these principles specifying the MAS meta-models that define its [[modeling language]] and allow [[Automatic programming|generating automatically]] its development tools distributed as the INGENIAS Development Kit (IDK).&lt;ref name="pavon2005ingeniasmethodology"&gt;{{cite book

== Details ==

The INGENIAS approach based on MDE supports research in different areas characterized by the use of modeling languages and requiring flexibility to adapt these to new requirements. In particular, it has been very successful in the areas of [[Software agent|Software Agents]] and [[Agent-based model|Agent-based simulation]].&lt;ref name="fuentes2012metamodels"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Software agent|agent paradigm]] uses the concept of ''agent'' as the basis to develop complex software systems. The field is fairly fragmented with different approaches on how to apply agents and perspectives on the agent concept itself. In this context, INGENIAS emerged as an integrative approach able to support the simultaneous use of different works.&lt;ref name=gomez2002metodologia /&gt; This use is based in the facilities to develop new version of its modeling language. The addition, modification, or deletion of concepts just requires modifying its meta-models and then regenerating the development tools using INGENME.&lt;ref name=gomez2010ingenme /&gt; This allows researchers focusing on the theoretical tasks of deciding what are the relevant concepts, relationships and attributes of their work, as the infrastructure generates the support tools for their application.

This flexibility has facilitated that INGENIAS addressed new extensions over the years. Two of them are of particular relevance. INGENIAS development process has been one of the few processes of agent-oriented [[Software development methodologies|methodologies]] in having their development process formally specified with [[SPEM]], a language of the Object Management Group ([[Object Management Group|OMG]]). Currently, there is one development process based on the [[Unified Process]] and another based on [[Scrum (development)|Scrum]].&lt;ref name=garcia2009ingenias&gt;{{cite journal

It also incorporated research on [[requirements elicitation]] from an organizational perspective. This work adopts the [[Activity Theory]] framework from [[Social Sciences]] to develop a modeling language for requirements with a holistic perspective of organizations and their systems, as well as several semi-automated processes for the elicitation and validation of these requirements.&lt;ref name="fuentes2004teoria"&gt;{{cite thesis

The continuous revision of the INGENIAS modeling language and the tools for its application have made of it one of the most popular methodologies in the literature and actually applied by researchers and engineers. It has been repeatedly included in relevant surveys and comparisons in the field (according to [[Google Scholar]], Elsevier's [[Scopus]] and Thomson ISI's [[Web of Knowledge]]), e.g., Brian Henderson-Sellers and Paolo Giorgini (2005) or Beydoun et al.

'''Intellectual humility''' is often described as an [[intellectual virtue]], along with other perceived virtues such as [[open-mindedness]], intellectual courage and integrity, and in contrast to proposed intellectual vices, such as [[pride]] and arrogance. See "Doxastic Definition of Intellectual Humility."

== Importance of intellectual humility ==

There is widespread agreement among philosophers and psychologists that intellectual humility is important and valuable in some way, especially if one is going to engage with deep disagreements in a productive way. However, there is little consensus about the precise nature of intellectual humility. For example, some philosophers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitcomb|first=Dennis|last2=Battaly|first2=Heather|last3=Baehr|first3=Jason|last4=Howard-Snyder|first4=Daniel|date=2015-08-01|title=Intellectual Humility: Owning Our Limitations|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phpr.12228/abstract|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/phpr.12228|issn=1933-1592}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasise the importance of a disposition to own one’s particular limitations (e.g. the limitations of one’s knowledge and perspective), while others{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} focus on the connection between humility and a low concern for status. Meanwhile, psychologists such as [[Justin L. Barrett|Justin Barrett]] and Peter Hill are working on better understanding the science behind intellectual humility, and on developing accurate measures{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} that can tell us more about how to quantify humility.

 To this we must add that the participation of intellectual humility should not be prescribed, because when it is in a circle in which all the actors know the topic to be addressed, but for their private evidence are closed to the arguments to the contrary, intellectual arrogance (See "Intellectual Arrogance" defined in Section "A Virutous Mean" is unproductive and inappropriate because what is not being sought with this discussion is the exposure of all the evidence in a "game" to sudden death, according to the weight of the evidence that won the discussion; this allows the elimination of "Pilate's washing his hands", of not taking certain evidence as real and proven by mere caprice of evidence left in the deprivation. This leads to asperities within the discussion, but forces to set a clear and concise precedent, which is productive for the human advance within the religious discussions. That is, not to go to the intellectual humility to endure a discussion gives a stratum of understanding that can not continue to overlap business under the table of any kind.{{explain|date=December 2017}} Endowing class and honor also puts the chest for its evidence defended and known true from the beginning.{{explain|date=December 2017}}

== Doxastic definition of intellectual humility ==

Drs. Ian M. Church and Peter L. Samuelson proposed a [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-knowledge/ doxastic] &lt;ref&gt;1&lt;/ref&gt; account of intellectual humility. They considered intellectual humility as a virtue, one of valuing one’s own beliefs "as he or she ought.” &lt;ref&gt;2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A “Virtuous Mean” ===

With this “as he or she ought” as the guiding principle, Church and Samuelson proposed: “Prima facie, humility is the virtuous mean between arrogance, on the one hand, and self depreciation or diffidence on the other." &lt;ref&gt;2&lt;/ref&gt;

People are intellectually arrogant when they erroneously evaluate their intellectual capacity higher than warranted (“smarter than average).&lt;ref&gt;2&lt;/ref&gt;  This results in the intellectually arrogant person being more closed-minded and biased than the intellectually humble person.

People who are intellectually diffident are those who fail “to appropriately recognize or appreciate their intellectual achievements.” &lt;ref&gt;2&lt;/ref&gt; Such a person is less inclined to speak out when he or she encounters wrong information.

=== Advantages to Doxastic Intellectual Humility ===

Drs. Church and Samuelson cite several advantages of this treatment of intellectual humility as a virtue. By adopting such an approach, one is better equipped to counter a natural tendency to overestimate one's strengths, and underestimate one’s weakness, thus countering confirmation bias. 2 Church and Samuelson further propose that by being open to the viewpoint of others, one positions oneself for growth and learning.

The doxastic definition of intellectual humility does not necessarily [missing verb] that one abandon[s] one’s beliefs, only that one [is/be] open to new and alternative viewpoints.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5318">'''James Allen Graff''' (b. [[East Orange]], NJ, 1937 - d. [[Toronto]], ON, October 23, 2005) was a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Toronto]] and an activist focused on human rights in Palestine. 

==Academic background==
He earned a BA at Lafayette College in 1959 and his doctorate at [[Brown University]] in 1963 with a thesis titled: ''The Concept of a Moral Agent.'' As a professor at Toronto his teaching focused on ethics and political philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vicu.utoronto.ca/Assets/VICU+Digital+Assets/Victoria+University/VICU+Digital+Assets/Senate/November_30_2005_Senate+minutes.pdf.pdf 'Memorial resolution on the late Professor James Graff read by Professor Henry Pietersma to the Senate of Victoria University, Toronto,'] Nov. 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;John Irving, then head of the Department of Ethics at [[Victoria University, Toronto|Victoria College]], hired him as a lecturer in 1963.  When [[Francis Sparshott]] stepped down as chairman of that department in 1970, Graff was appointed to succeed him.  He held the post until the Department of Ethics was abolished and its members absorbed into the Department of Philosophy in 1975. He stayed at the department of philosophy, as a professor until 2002 and as professor emeritus until his death.&lt;ref&gt;'Minerva's Aviary: Philosophy at Toronto 1843-2003,' John A. Slater, University of Toronto Press, 2005, pg. 507&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Palestine activism==
According to his University of Toronto obituary, "His principal interest in later years was the plight of the [[Palestinian people]]" and he wrote and spoke "widely and passionately on that topic".&lt;ref name=utoronto&gt;{{cite web|title=Philosophy News|url=http://www.philosophy.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2006-PDF-of-Philosophy-News.pdf|publisher=University of Toronto|page=6|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graff founded Canada's Near East Cultural and Education Foundation (NECEF) in 1984, which describes its mission as promoting "a greater understanding in Canada of the history, culture and contemporary situation in the Middle East, focusing on the Arab World" and funding "humanitarian, educational, development and health related projects both in the region and here at home."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.necef.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=29 'NECEF about page,']&lt;/ref&gt;

His obituary in Canada's [[The Globe and Mail]] called him a "passionate and tireless advocate of Palestinian rights, he poured most of his energy into public awareness and alleviation of the plight of Palestinian children living under Israeli occupation and in the Arab world." The paper also said he "also criticized the Palestinian Authority's record on human rights -- at a cost to the movement that may never be known." From 1986 to 1996 Graff represented NECEF on and was vice chairman of the North American Coordinating Committee for Non-Governmental Organizations on the Question of Palestine. That group "met regularly at United Nations headquarters in New York." He stepped down from the committee in 1996 due to becoming legally blind.

"Jim hated [violence]," Anglican Reverend Robert Assaly told The Globe and Mail, recalling how Palestinian official human rights abuses - first by the PLO and later by the PA - started to capture Graff's attention during the negotiation of  the [[Oslo Peace Accords]]. "Not only did he speak out against the violence, he spoke out against the violent. He and I kind of got the whole Non-governmental Organization movement on the Question of Palestine tossed out of the United Nations for that."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/incoming/james-graff-teacher-and-activist-1937-2005/article18245963/ 'James Graff, teacher and activist, 1937-2005,'] Ron Csillag, The Globe and Mail, Nov. 28 2005&lt;/ref&gt;   

Janet Gunn in her memoir recalls the instrumental role Graff played in trying to save the life of Mohamed Abu Aker, a Palestinian 16-year-old who in 1988 had been shot by an Israeli soldier during a stone-throwing demonstration in his refugee camp near Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank. Aker needed a small bowel transplant if he was to survive his wounds - something that could not be done in the West Bank - and Graff used his contacts in the US to arrange the required visas and medical care. Mohamed eventually died from his injuries in October 1990.&lt;ref&gt;'Second Life: A West Bank Memoir,' Janet Varner Gunn, Regents of the University of Minnesota, 1995, pgs. 5-8&lt;/ref&gt;

An annual scholarship is awarded for study at [[Birzeit University]] in memory of Graff and Patrick Newton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.necef.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=22&amp;Itemid=54 NECEF projects page,']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jason Stanley''' (born  October 12, 1969) is an [[Americans|American]] [[philosopher]], currently Jacob Urowsky Professor of Philosophy at [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, CT]]. He is best known for his contributions to [[philosophy of language]] and [[epistemology]], which often draw upon and have influence in other fields including [[linguistics]] and [[cognitive science]]. He has also written for a popular audience at the ''[[New York Times]]'' philosophy blog "The Stone".  In his more recent work, he has brought tools from [[philosophy of language]] and [[epistemology]] to bear on questions of political philosophy, especially in his 2015 book ''How Propaganda Works'', which grew out of some blog essays at "The Stone."

== Education ==

Stanley graduated from [[Corcoran High School]] in his hometown of [[Syracuse, New York]]. He studied in [[Lünen]], [[Germany]], from 1985 to 1986 as part of the [[Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange]], after which he enrolled in the [[State University of New York]] in [[Binghamton, NY]], where he studied [[philosophy of language]] under [[Jack Kaminsky]]. In 1987 he transferred to [[Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen]], but returned to the [[State University of New York]] in 1988, this time at the [[Stony Brook University|Stony Brook]] campus. There, he studied philosophy and [[linguistics]] under [[Peter Ludlow]] and [[Richard Larson]]. Stanley received his BA in May 1990, and went on to receive his PhD from [[MIT]] in January 1995 with [[Robert Stalnaker]] as his thesis advisor.

== Academic career ==

After receiving his doctorate, Stanley accepted a position at [[University College, Oxford|University College]], [[Oxford]], as a stipendiary lecturer. He returned from [[England]] shortly thereafter to [[New York (state)|New York]] to teach at [[Cornell University]]. In 2000, he left Cornell and became an Associate Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]]. In 2004, he moved to the department of philosophy at [[Rutgers University]], where he taught from 2004 to 2013. In March 2013 he accepted a professorship at [[Yale University]]. His book ''Knowledge and Practical Interests'' won the 2007 [[American Philosophical Association]] book prize.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110713011136/http://www.apaonline.org/opportunities/prizes/book.aspx "Prizes and Awards: Book Prize"], The American Philosophical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; He has supervised many doctoral dissertations, and his former students now teach at [[Cornell University]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles]], among other places.

'''Meno's slave''' is a character in the [[Socratic dialogue]] ''[[Meno]]'', which was written by [[Plato]]. 

Socrates demonstrates his method of questioning and recollection by questioning a slave boy who works in [[Menon III of Pharsalus|Meno]]'s house. This [[house slave]] is ignorant of geometry. The subsequent discussion shows the slave capable of learning a complicated geometry problem. In this way, Socrates shows Meno that learning is possible. Indeed, the dialogue earlier demonstrated Meno's failure to benefit from Socratic teaching.

==The discussion of Socrates and the house slave==
[[image:Meno (Socrates) drawing 29.gif|thumb|Meno's young [[house slave]] receives a [[problem-based learning|lesson]] in geometry under [[Socrates]] in [[Plato]]'s [[dialogues of Plato|dialogue]] ''[[Meno]]''.]]
By drawing geometric figures in the ground Socrates demonstrates that the slave is initially unaware of how to find twice the area of a square. 
 
Socrates notes that before he questioned the slave, who had been picked haphazardly from Meno's entourage, the boy would have thought himself able to speak "well and fluently" on the subject of a square double the size of a given square.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 84c&lt;/ref&gt; Without Socratic questioning, the slave boy would have remained confident in his ignorance and not have "attempted to look for, or learn, what he thought he knew (though he did not [know])." Socrates comments that this "numbing" he caused in the slave did him no harm.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 84b&lt;/ref&gt; 

Socrates then draws a second square figure on the diagonal so that the slave can see that by adding vertical and horizontal lines touching the corners of the square, the double of its area is created. He gets the slave to agree that this is twice the size of the original square and says that he has "spontaneously recovered" knowledge he knew from a past life&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 85d&lt;/ref&gt; without having been taught. Socrates is satisfied that new beliefs were "newly aroused" in the slave.

'''Mohammad Akram Khan''' ({{circa|1868}} – August 18, 1969) was a Bengali journalist, politician and Islamic scholar. He was the founder of Dhaka's first Bengali newspaper, ''[[The Azad]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Razzaq|first1=Rana|title=Khan, Mohammad Akram|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Khan,_Mohammad_Akram|website=[[Banglapedia]]|publisher=Bangladesh Asiatic Society|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education==
Khan was born in Hakimpur, [[24 Parganas]] district of [[Bengal Presidency]], [[British India]] (in present-day [[West Bengal]]) in 1868. He did not have a British education but studied at Calcutta Madrasah (now [[Aliah University]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He entered the journalism profession at a very young age before becoming involved in politics.

== Career ==

=== Journalism ===
Early in his career, he worked at newspapers ''Ahl-i-Hadith'' and ''Mohammadi Akhbar''. Between 1908 and 1921, he worked as the editor of [[The Mohammadi|the ''Mohammadi'']] and the ''Al-Islam''. He published the ''Zamana'' and the ''Sebak'' between 1920 and 1922. Sebak was banned and Akram Khan was arrested on the basis that his anti-government editorials supported the [[Non-cooperation Movement]] and the [[Swadeshi movement]].

From October 1936, Akram Khan began publishing the newspaper ''[[The Azad]]'', which generated support for the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] in [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Yusuf |first1=Ananta |title=Story of the Bangla press |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/the-star/cover-story/story-the-bangla-press-3161 |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |date=20 February 2015 |accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political career ===
Before joining politics, while as a student of [[Aliah University|Calcutta Alia Madrasa]], Khan formed a movement in favour of teaching all subjects in Bangladesh. Akram Khan was also one of the founding members of the Muslim League in 1906. He was involved in the Khilafat and Non-cooperation Movement from 1918 to 1924. He was elected secretary of the [[All India Khilafat Committee]] at the conference held at [[Ahsan Manzil]] in [[Dhaka]] in 1920, which was attended by other eminent [[Khilafat Movement]] leaders like [[Abul Kalam Azad]], [[Maniruzzaman Islamabadi]] and Mujibur Rahman.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Akram was responsible for collecting funds for the [[Ottoman Caliphate|Ottoman caliphate]]. During 1920–1923, he organised public meetings in different parts of Bengal to propagate the cause of the Khilafat and the Non-cooperation Movement. As a believer in Hindu-Muslim amity, Akram Khan supported [[Chitta Ranjan Das]]'s Swaraj Party in Kolkata in 1922, and also the Bengal pact in 1923.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; But due to the communal riots of 1926–1927 and other contemporary political developments, Akram Khan lost his faith in Indian nationalist politics and left both the [[Swaraj Party]] and Congress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From 1929 to 1935, Khan was deeply involved in the [[Krishak Praja Party]]. However, he left peasant politics in 1936 and became an activist for the Muslim League. He was a member of the central working committee of the League until 1947. After the [[partition of India]] in 1947, he opted for [[East Bengal]] and settled in Dhaka. He was the President of Muslim League (East Pakistan) until he retired from politics in 1960.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Akram Khan was also involved in the [[Bengali Language Movement]] of 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Maulana Akram Khan: Pioneer of Bengali Muslim journalism |url=http://thedailynewnation.com/news/105189/maulana-akram-khan-pioneer-of-bengali-muslim-journalism.html |newspaper=The New Nation |date=26 August 2016 |accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a founding member of Pakistan's [[Council of Islamic Ideology]], a constitutional body formed in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Advisory body of Islamic ideology set up |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/738493/advisory-body-of-islamic-ideology-set-up |newspaper=[[Dawn]] |date=31 July 2012 |orig-year=Originally published 1962 |access-date=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Khan died on 18 August 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Death anniversary of Maulana Akram Khan Friday |url = http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2006/08/16/death-anniversary-of-maulana-akram-khan-friday |date = 16 August 2008 |newspaper = bdnew24.com |accessdate = 12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at the Ahl-i-Hadith Bangshal mosque at Lalbagh PS in Dhaka.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2923">'''Mushahada''' or Mushahida  (contemplation, witnessing), derived from '''shuhud''' to witness, is a concept in [[Sufism]]. It is the vision 'of' or 'by' God so that the seeker of God may acquire [[yaqeen]] which can neither be inherited nor can it be gained through the intellect. The life of a [[Sufi]] or a seeker of God is meaningless without Mushahada because his goal is to remain ever-present in the vision of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gardet|first=L.|title=Encyclopedia of Islam, Second Edition|work="Kashf"|accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inverse of Mushahada is Hijab i.e. when the [[Divine]] Face is veiled which is considered a punishment for a Sufi. "Divine Love leads to Mushahida (the observation of Divinity) and possesses the Essence of the true mystic knowledge but the intellect has superficial knowledge only".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohammad Najib ur Rehman|first=Hazrat Sakhi Sultan|title=Sultan Bahoo:the Life and Teachings,|journal=Sultan ul Faqr Publications Regd,First Edition, {{ISBN|9789699795183}}|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlyMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=mushahida+sultan+bahoo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mushahida%20sultan%20bahoo&amp;f=false|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mushahida is the 'unity of vision (of Allah)' which takes over the seekers of Allah through the spiritual beneficence of their [[Murshid]]. In such a state, all they see through their spiritual eye or 'sight' is nothing save Allah. All perception appears to be Allah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ansari|first=Ali|title=Sufism and Beyond: Sufi Thought in the Light of Late 20th Century Science,|journal=Mapin Publishing Pvt Ltd, {{ISBN|9788185822723}}|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EFWl4zWr_PsC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=mushahida+meaning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mushahida%20meaning&amp;f=false|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a tradition related to the famous mystic [[Bayazid Bastami]], he was asked about his age. He replied, “Four years.” He was asked for an explanation due to his answer to which he replied, “I have been veiled from God by this world for seventy years, but I have seen Him during the last four years; the period in which one is veiled does not belong to one’s life.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/mushahadah|title=Mushahadah, Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=britannica.com |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "When the views, the viewed and the process of viewing-all are one, I wonder who is observing who is this observation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chaturvedi|first=B.K.|title=Agni Purana,|journal=Ghalib's Poetry on Mushahida (witnessing)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xJSR4KA3Ac0C&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=mushahida&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mushahida&amp;f=false|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=Why is this quote here?|date=November 2015}}

[[File:Bhutanese painted thanka of Milarepa (1052-1135), Late 19th-early 20th Century, Dhodeydrag Gonpa, Thimphu, Bhutan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Milarepa, wearing the distinctive white shawl (''zen'') of a Ngagpa]]
In [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[Bon]],{{sfn|Sihlé|2009|p=150}} a '''Ngagpa''' ({{bo|t=སྔགས་པ་|w=sngags pa}}; [[Sanskrit]] ''mantrī'') is a non-monastic practitioner of [[Dzogchen]] who has received a ''skra dbang'', a hair empowerment, for example in the Dudjom Tersar lineage. This empowers one's hair as the home of the dakinis and therefore can never be cut. The term is specifically used to refer to lamas and practitioners (male or female{{efn|A few popular books and websites published in the west use the term "ngakma" or "ngakmo" for a female ngakpa. However, these terms occur nowhere in the 3 volume (3,000+ page) Great Tibetan Dictionary or it seems in traditional or academic sources.}}) who are “tantric specialists”{{efn|"Literally, ''ngakpa'' refers to a specialist of mantras, ''ngak'' [''sngags'']; however the term ''ngak'' also refers to tantric Buddhism as such, technically known as Sangngak Dorjé Tekpa [Gsang sngags rdo rje theg pa], the ‘Adamantine Secret Mantra Path’. Some ''sngags pa'' include in their specialisation the practice of concise but powerful ritual acts focused on the application of certain mantras, but ''ngakpa'' in general specialise primarily [....] in larger, more complex tantric rituals, hence the designation ‘tantrist’."{{sfn|Sihlé|2009|p=147 n.7}}}} and may technically be applied to both married householder tantric priests (''khyim pa sngags pa'') and to those ordained monastics whose principal focus and specialization is vajrayana practice. However, in common parlance (and many western books on Tibetan Buddhism), “ngakpa” is often used only in reference to non monastic Vajrayana priests, especially those in the [[Nyingma]] and Bonpo traditions.

In Bhutan, and some other parts of the Himalayas, the term ''gomchen'' is the term most often used to refer to this type of Vajrayana priest,{{sfn|Phuntsok Tashi|2005|p=77}} with ''ngakpa'' being reserved only for the most accomplished adepts amongst them who have become renowned for their mantras being particularly efficacious.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Traditionally, many Nyingma ngakpas wear uncut hair and white robes and these are sometimes called "the white-robed and uncut-hair group" (Wylie: gos dkar lcang lo'i sde).{{sfn|Terrone|2010|p=}}

==Description and definitions==
[[Matthieu Ricard]] defines ngakpa simply as "a practitioner of the Secret Mantrayana" .{{sfn|Ricard|1994|p=12 n.23}}  [[Gyurme Dorje]] defines ngakpa (mantrin) as "a practitioner of the mantras, who may live as a householder rather than a renunciate monk." {{sfn|Dorje|2004|p=840}}

Tibetan Buddhism contains two systems of ordination, the familiar monastic ordinations and the less well known Ngagpa or Tantric ordinations.{{sfn|Terrone|2010|p=}} Ngagpa ordination is non-monastic and non-celibate, but not "lay." It entails its own extensive system of vows, distinct from the monastic vows.

Ngakpas often marry and have children. Some work in the world, though they are required to devote significant time to retreat and practice and in enacting rituals when requested by, or on behalf of, members of the community.

There are family lineages of Ngakpas, with the practice of a particular [[Yidam]] being passed through family lineages. However, a ngakpa may also be deemed as anyone thoroughly immersed and engaged in the practice of the teachings and under the guidance of a lineage-holder and who has taken the appropriate vows or [[samaya]] and had the associated empowerments and transmissions. Significant lineage transmission is through oral lore.

As scholar [[Sam van Schaik]] describes, "the lay tantric practitioner (''sngags pa'', Skt. ''māntrin'') became a common figure in Tibet, and would remain so throughout the history of Tibetan Buddhism." {{efn|The term 'lay' however is misleading as ngakpas are all ordained member of the non-celibate wing of the ordained sangha. The term 'lay' means 'non-professional' or 'not of the clergy' and ngakpas (such as HH Dudjom Rinpoche who was the Supreme Head of the Nyingma Tradition) cannot be described as 'not of the clergy'.{{sfn|Van Schaik|2004|p=4}}}}

Kunga Gyaltsen, the father of the [[2nd Dalai Lama]], was a non-monastic ngakpa, a famous [[Nyingma]] tantric master.&lt;ref&gt;Thubten Samphel and Tendar, (2004) ''The Dalai Lamas of Tibet'', p. 79. Roli &amp; Janssen, New Delhi. {{ISBN|81-7436-085-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Machik Kunga Pemo; they were a farming family. Their lineage transmission was by birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dalailama.com/page.51.htm#Gedun_Gyatso Gedun Gyatso] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051213024822/http://www.dalailama.com/page.51.htm |date=2005-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3487">The '''Optional Prisoner's Dilemma''' (OPD) game models a situation of conflict involving two players in [[game theory]]. It can be seen as an extension of the standard [[prisoner's dilemma]] game, where players have the option to "reject the deal", that is, to abstain from playing the game.&lt;ref name="cardinot1"&gt;{{Cite book |first1 = Marcos |last1= Cardinot | first2 = Maud |last2= Gibbons |first3= Colm |last3= O'Riordan |first4= Josephine |last4= Griffith | chapter = Simulation of an Optional Strategy in the Prisoner’s Dilemma in Spatial and Non-spatial Environments | doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-43488-9_14 | title = From Animals to Animats 14 | series = [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] | volume = 9825 | pages = 145-156 | year = 2016 | isbn =  978-3-319-43487-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of game can be used as a model for a number of real world situations in which agents are afforded the third option of abstaining from a game interaction such as an election. &lt;ref name="batali"&gt;{{cite journal |first1 = John |last1= Batali |first2= Philip |last2= Kitcher |year= 1995 |title= Evolution of altriusm in optional and compulsory games |journal = [[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |pages = 161–171| volume= 175 |issue= 2 |doi=10.1006/jtbi.1995.0128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Payoff matrix==

The structure of the Optional Prisoner's Dilemma can be generalized from the standard prisoner's dilemma game setting. In this way, suppose that the two players are represented by the colors, red and blue, and that each player chooses to "Cooperate", "Defect" or "Abstain". &lt;ref name="cardinot2"&gt;{{cite book |first1 = Marcos |last1= Cardinot |first2= Colm |last2= O'Riordan |first3= Josephine |last3= Griffith |chapter= The Optional Prisoner's Dilemma in a Spatial Environment: Coevolving Game Strategy and Link Weights |doi=10.5220/0006053900860093 | title = ECTA | series = Proceedings of the 8th International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence |pages = 86-93 |volume=1  |year= 2016  | isbn=978-989-758-201-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[payoff matrix]] for the game is shown below:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Canonical OPD payoff matrix
|
!scope="col" style="color: #900"|Cooperate
!scope="col" style="color: #900"|Defect
!scope="col" style="color: #900"|Abstain

|{{color|#009|''L''}}, {{color|#900|''L''}}
|}

* If both players cooperate, they both receive the reward ''R'' for mutual cooperation.
* If both players defect, they both receive the punishment payoff ''P''.
* If Blue defects while Red cooperates, then Blue receives the temptation payoff ''T'', while Red receives the "sucker's" payoff, ''S''.
* Similarly, if Blue cooperates while Red defects, then Blue receives the sucker's payoff ''S'', while Red receives the temptation payoff ''T''.
* If one or both players abstain, both receive the loner's payoff ''L''.

The following condition must hold for the payoffs:

''T'' &gt; ''R'' &gt; ''L'' &gt; ''P'' &gt; ''S''

'''Outreach''' is an activity of providing services to any populations who might not otherwise have access to those services.&lt;ref name="HardyKingston2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Centre2009"/&gt; A key component of outreach is that the groups providing it are not stationary, but mobile; in other words they are meeting those in need of outreach services at the locations where those in need are.&lt;ref name="HardyKingston2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Centre2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dewson"/&gt; In addition to delivering services, outreach has an educational role, raising the awareness of existing services.&lt;ref name=dewson/&gt;

Outreach is often meant to fill in the gap in the services provided by mainstream (often, governmental) services, and is often carried out by [[non-profit]], [[nongovernmental organization]]s.&lt;ref name="HardyKingston2010"/&gt; This is a major element differentiating outreach from [[public relations]].&lt;ref name="EliassonRiemer1999"/&gt; Compared with staff providing traditional services, Dewson et al. (2006) notes that outreach staff may be less qualified, but are more highly motivated.&lt;ref name=dewson/&gt;

Rhodes (1996) distinguishes between three types of outreach: domiciliary (undertaken at individual homes), detached (undertaken in public environments and targeting individuals), and peripatetic (undertaken at public or private environments and targeting organizations rather than individuals).&lt;ref name="Rhodes1996"/&gt; Dewson et al. (2006) lists another type in addition to those three: the satellite type, where services are provided at a dedicated site.&lt;ref name=dewson/&gt;

Dewson et al. (2006) list the following tools of outreach: leaflets, newsletters, advertising; stalls and displays, and dedicated events, with the common location being local community institutions such as libraries, community centres, markets and so on.&lt;ref name=dewson/&gt; Compared with traditional service providers, outreach services are provided closer to individuals residence, are voluntary, and have fewer, if any, enforceable obligations.&lt;ref name=dewson/&gt;

Outreach can target various populations, from [[sex workers]]&lt;ref name="HardyKingston2010"/&gt; and [[drug]] users,&lt;ref name="Rhodes1996"/&gt; to museum goers.&lt;ref name="Sachatello-Sawyer2002"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3288">'''''Peace dividend''''' is a political slogan popularized by US President [[George H.W. Bush]] and UK Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the early 1990s, purporting to describe the [[economics|economic]] benefit of a decrease in defense spending.  It is used primarily in discussions relating to the [[guns versus butter theory]].  The term was frequently used at the end of the [[Cold War]], when many [[Western world|Western nations]] significantly cut [[military spending]] (such as Britain's [[Options for Change]] defence review).

==Real or not?==
While economies do undergo a [[recession]] after the end of a major conflict as the economy is forced to adjust and retool, a "peace dividend" refers to a potential long-term benefit as budgets for defense spending are assumed  to be at least partially redirected to social programs and/or a decrease in taxation rates.  The existence of a peace dividend in real economies is still debated, but some research points to its reality.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjeev Gupta, Benedict Clements, Rina Bhattacharya, and Shamit Chakravarti (2002), [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2002/12/gupta.htm "The Elusive Peace Dividend"] at ''[[Finance &amp; Development]]'', a quarterly magazine of the IMF.&lt;/ref&gt;

A political discussion about the peace dividend resulting from the end of the [[Cold War]] involves a debate about which countries have actually scaled back military spending and which have not. The scale back in defense spending was mainly noticeable in [[Western Europe]] and in the [[Russian Federation]]. The [[United States]], whose military spending was rapidly reducing between 1985 and 1993 and remained flat between 1993 and 1999,&lt;ref name="priorities"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalpriorities.org/u_s_military_spending|title=U.S. military spending|publisher=[[National Priorities Project]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; has dramatically increased it after [[September 11, 2001]] to fund conflicts like the [[War on Terror]], the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] and the [[War in Iraq]].

==Other uses==
"Peace dividend" can also refer to the improved economy in [[Northern Ireland]] after the signing of the [[Good Friday Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/05/06/us-irish-economy-idUSL0283780420080506 |title=Northern Ireland looks to make peace dividend pay |first=Jonathan |last=Saul |work=Reuters |publisher=Thomson Reuters |date=5 May 2008 |accessdate=22 October 2012 |quote=Northern Ireland's authorities hope that era, which claimed over 3,600 lives and was known as [[The Troubles]], is now closed, and they say they are already reaping a peace dividend. In the past 10 years, over 100,000 jobs have been created, and the unemployment rate now stands at around 4.2 percent, below the UK average of about 5.2 percent. Economic growth in Northern Ireland averaged around 2.9 to 3 percent from 1996 to 2007, which was above the United Kingdom's average of around 2.8 percent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Premier Executive Transport Services''' was an airline listed as Foreign Corporation in the [[Massachusetts|Commonwealth of Massachusetts]].

'''Ṣadr al-[[Dīn]] Muḥammad b. Isḥāq b. Muḥammad b. Yūnus Qūnawī''' [alternatively, Qūnavī, Qūnyawī], ({{lang-fa|صدر الدین قونوی}}), ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: Sadreddin Konevî), (1207-1274 CE/605-673 AH), was one of the most influential thinkers in mystical or [[Sufism|Sufi]] philosophy. He played a pivotal role in the study of knowledge—or epistemology, which in his context referred specifically to the theoretical elaboration of mystical/intellectual insight. He combined a highly original mystic-thinker, Muḥyī al-Dīn [[Ibn 'Arabī]]&lt;ref name=path&gt;{{cite book|first=William C.|last=Chittick|title=The Sufi Path of Knowledge: Ibn al-ʻArabi's Metaphysics of Imagination|location=New York|publisher=SUNY Press|publication-date=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1165-1240 CE/560-638 AH), whose arcane teachings Qūnavī codified and helped incorporate into the burgeoning pre-Ottoman intellectual tradition, on the one hand, with the logical/philosophical innovations of Ibn Sīnā (Lat., Avicenna), on the other.&lt;ref name=Shaker&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaker|first=Anthony F.|title=Thinking in the Language of Reality: Ṣadr al-[[Dīn]] Qūnavī (1207-74 CE) and the Mystical Philosophy of Reason|location=Lac-des-Iles|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|publication-date=2012|isbn=9781479718030}} Print on demand accessdate=19 Jan 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Though relatively unfamiliar to Westerners, the spiritual and systematic character of Qūnawī's approach to reasoning, in the broadest sense of the term, have found fertile soil in modern-day Turkey, North Africa and Iran not to mention India, China, the Balkans and elsewhere over the centuries.

==Biography==
Little is known about Qūnawī's personal life. As a young boy, Ṣadr al-Dīn was adopted by Ibn 'Arabī,&lt;ref name="EIS"&gt;W.C. Chittick, "Sadr al-Din Muhammad b. Ishak b. Muhammad b. Yunus al-Kunawi", Encyclopaedia of Islam. Edited by: P. Bearman , Th. Bianquis , C.E. Bosworth , E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2007. Brill Online.&lt;/ref&gt; whose pupil he was. Of Persian descent,&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Peters, "The Monotheists", Published by Princeton University Press, 2005. pg 330: "Al-Qunawi was a Persian Sufi.."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chittick"&gt; pg xvii: "Qunawi, a Persian had a profoundly different intellectual makeup"&lt;/ref&gt; he nevertheless lived and taught in the city of [[Konya]] (modern-day Turkey where he is known as Sadreddin Konevî). There he drew very close to [[Rumi|Mawlāna Jalāl-e Dīn Rūmī]] and participated in his spiritual circle.

[[File:Tomb of Sadereddin Konevi (Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi).jpg|thumb|Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi's tomb is in Konya where he settled and built his reputation]]A master of ḥadīth, people came to [[Konya]] from distant lands just to study under him. But while he was reputed for his profound understanding of the [[Quran]] and [[Ḥadīth]], he knew the ancient [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] [[philosophy]] intimately, no doubt thanks chiefly to Ibn Sīnā, who commented extensively on the works of Aristotle. However, Qūnawī himself may have studied an Arabic translation of Aristotle's "Metaphysics," being one of a handful of truly insightful, post-Avicennan critics of Aristotle, even if he was not a full-fledged commentator in the spirit of [[Ibn Rushd]].

Qūnawī's overall influence appears more strategic than wide. Moreover, some of his students found fame. He instructed [[Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi]], who went on to author a commentary, now well-known, on [[Shahab al-Din Yahya ibn Habash Suhrawardi|Suhrawardi]]'s ''Ḥikmat al-Ishrāq''. Another student of Qūnawī's, the Sufi poet [[Fakhr-al-Din Iraqi]], was instrumental in introducing Ibn 'Arabī into the Persian language.&lt;ref&gt;Sayyed Hossein Nasr, "Three Muslim Sages." Harvard University Press, 1964, 118-119.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mystical vs. philosophical knowledge==
After visiting the grave of Ibn 'Arabī a spell after his teacher and father-in-law had died, Qūnavī described a mystical experience he had about his teacher, Ibn 'Arabī, thus:

&lt;small&gt;I walked one summery day through an empty stretch in the Taurus. An easterly wind was stirring the blossoms. I gazed at them and reflected upon God's power, might and majesty (exalted be He). The love of the Merciful [God] filled me with such ardent passion that I labored to part with created things. Then, the spirit of Shaykh Ibn 'Arabī was personified to me in the most splendid form, as if he were a pure light. He called out [to me], “O ye who are perplexed, behold me! If God sublime and transcendent hath shown Himself to me in a flash of manifestation from the noble elevation of the essence, absent hast thou been from me therein by a mere glance of an eye.” I agreed at once and, as if he had been standing there [bodily] before my eyes, the Shaykh al-Akbar [i.e., Ibn Arabī] greeted me with the salutations of reunion after a parting and embraced me affectionately, saying: “Praise be to God who the veil hath lifted and who bringeth those dear unto each other into reunion. No goal, effort or salvation hath been disaffirmed".&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Yūsuf|last=b. Ismā'īl al-Nabhānī|title=Jāmi' karamāt al-awliyā’|volume=1|editor1-first=Ibrāhīm |editor1-last='Aṭwah'awḍ|location=Beirut|publisher=Dār al-Fikr|publication-date=1992|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His recollection of this dream seems to indicate not just continuing deference to his teacher, but also what he saw as the practical end of reason. Though a different intellectual breed than his deceased mentor, Qūnavī too was a practising mystic, not just a thinker and teacher. In other words, he was a mystic who excelled in formal sciences like ḥadīth studies, Qurānic exegesis (ijtihād), dialectical theology (kalām), jurisprudence (fiqh), and philosophical sciences; and he corresponded with contemporaries like Nāsīr al-Dīn Ṭūsī, whose mathematical and astronomical discoveries have become integral to the science we know today.

Qūnavī's significance arises from his firm place in Islam's "post-Avicennan" (or, more precisely, post-Falsafah) period, of which Latin European Scholastics (themselves struggling with the problematics posed by Avicenna) were likely oblivious. And yet, the intellectual current to which he belonged provided the context for, among other developments, the development of systematic reason and the elaborate philosophical tradition that emerged in Iran, including the prodigal [[Sadr al-Din Shirazi]], also called [[Mulla Sadra]].&lt;ref name=Shaker/&gt;

Although Qūnavī was single-mindedly devoted to the same general philosophical framework as Ibn 'Arabī's 'Abd al-Raḥmān Jāmī&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title='Abd al-Raḥmān Jāmī. Nafaḥāt al-uns min ḥaḍarāt al-quds|last1=Mahdī Tawḥīdī Pūr|location=Tehran|publisher=Kitābfurūshī Sa'dī|publication-date=1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; assured us that, despite the pupil's frustrated attempts to follow in his spiritual footsteps,[34] without a proper study of Qūnavī's works the true intention of Ibn 'Arabī regarding the so-called doctrine of Waḥdat al-Wujūd (a doctrine progeny has ascribed to Ibn 'Arabī) could not be discerned in any manner conforming to both reason and religious law (Jāmī 556). His relationship with the aging teacher notwithstanding, Qūnavī had to stake out his own personal connection to higher knowledge. At times, it seems, he distanced himself from Ibn 'Arabī altogether due to the emphasis on personal witness above the interpretation of others’ experience regardless of their social or spiritual station. [[Muhammad al-Munawi|Al-Munāwī]] (b. 1265) quoted him as saying that his teacher had striven to lead him to a level where God manifested Himself through flashes of manifestation to all seekers, but that he failed (NJK 222). Mystics describe a manifestation of this kind as a “flash,” because the “direct witnessing of the essence” resembles the light, speed, and evanescence of any ordinary flash or lightning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dr. Su'ād al-Ḥakīm|title=Al-Mu'jam al-ṣūfī|location=Beirut|publisher=Dandurah|publication-date=1981|pages=660-661}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Mahmud ibn Ali al-Qashani|Al-Qāshānī]] likened the “flash” to “the illumination appearing to a person that beckons and summons to the Presence of Proximity to the Lord for a journey within God.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kamāl al-Dīn'Abd al-Razzāq al-Qāshānī Isṭilāḥāt al-ṣūfīyah|edition=2|first=Dr. Muḥammad Kamāl|last=Ibrāhīm Ja'far|publisher=Intishārāt Bīdār|publication-date=1370|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn 'Arabī referred to the deep tranquility felt by the saintly “friends of God,” the awliyā’, who take their repose in it. Because tranquility did not always occur to them, they could only take furtive glances at the manifestation, as if in a flash (Hakim 660-61).

Paradoxically, then, his relationship with Ibn 'Arabī provided Qūnavī with a sound justification for seeking a separate path to spiritual enlightenment, on the one hand, and for developing the proper terms with which to express overarching truths, on the other, which truths paradoxically were accessible only through personal experience, not anyone else's.&lt;ref name=Shaker/&gt;

==Problem of knowledge==
Qūnavī considered it his life's task to complete what Ibn Sīnā had begun with his [[Illuminationism|Ishrāqī]] conception of knowledge. First, he shared with Ibn Sīnā and Ibn 'Arabī the goal of representing the intellectual/spiritual journey in communicable fashion. For any kind of knowledge or noetic discovery to be understood, it must be capable of being passed on to others (pupils, speculatively minded peers, etc.), rather than hoarded in the abstract ether of the mind, as it were. Whatever its technical complexities, it had to be didactically meaningful within a specific time and place, though without losing sight of the root object of knowledge.&lt;ref name=Shaker/&gt;

He worked out his principles in several treatises. Their most concise and substantial statement consists of a theoretical introduction to his magnum opus, "I'jāz al-bayān," the main body of which consists of a mystical exegesis of the "Sūrat al-Fātiḥah," the opening chapter of the Quran. In that introduction, Qūnavī plotted the transition from the demonstrative logic of Avicenna's “[[Theology|theological]] science”, '[[Ilm (Arabic)|ilm]] [[Allah|ilāhī]]), to a different kind of [[logic]] one might call an “exegetical grammar,” as more or less taught by Ibn 'Arabī.

To the followers of Ibn 'Arabī, “exegetical grammar” was vastly more suited to the paradoxical movements of the spirit, “dialogue” with God, and in a purely epistemological sense, the true “knowledge of the realities,” an expression that Qūnavī took to be chiefly of Avicennan inspiration. Anxious to preserve the transcendence of the Divine, but without expunging human activity or initiative, Qūnavī understood God's knowledge of Himself to be the root of all knowledge. On the surface, this formulation and the logical corollaries flowing from it appear to seal man's incapacity to discover the “realities of things” on his own (i.e., by his own inborn faculties).&lt;ref name=Shaker/&gt;

In a representative sense, human knowledge may be said to rest on the relation between two distinct, irreducible “realities”: subject and object. Given this subject-object distinction and the limitations of our own faculties, how could we ever know the “realities of things”? This theme permeates virtually all of Qūnavī's works. In his Introduction, he discussed several passages from Ibn Sīnā's posthumous "al-Ta'liqāt" (notebook). The only source he cared to mention for Ibn Sīnā's cogitations on the “realities,” the "Ta'liqāt" contained an unusually candid remark to the effect that man was incapable of knowing the realities of things. He took up this selfsame issue with Naṣīr al-[[Dīn]] Ṭūsī (d. 672/1274) in a fascinating philosophical correspondence, where "tashkīk" ("systematic ambiguity," a concept key to later philosophy) figures. In that debate, our thinker sought to demonstrate under what conditions man may know God, a goal he shared with both philosophers and mystics.

In a larger sense, Qūnavī was able to deepen the transformation of philosophical reason begun by his predecessors by virtue of a simple, incontrovertible fact: the mechanical logic of Peripatetic philosophy could not quite overcome the distinction between subject and object (the two most elementary “realities” in every act of knowing) except by correspondence, concomitance, etc.&lt;ref name=Shaker/&gt; Central to his project, on the other hand, was divine self-revelation. On this matter, Ibn 'Arabī had applied notoriously convoluted reasoning, often by association and in fragmentary outbursts. But like him, Qūnavī viewed divine self-revelation or -manifestation as the unfolding of a “book” penned in the form of constructed speech.

In short, self-revelation is the reality that underlies all realities. To elaborate the principles of its unfolding, he made thorough use of the demonstrative logic championed by both the falsāsifah (Islam's Hellenized philosophers, like Ibn Sīnā) and many Islamic theologians. But the new synthesis he was so keen to elucidate for "theological science," or 'ilm ilāhī, had to be properly anchored to a logos exhibiting the same characteristic concreteness as that familiar to him from divine speech, “God’s communications” to man (e.g., the "Qur’ān").&lt;ref name=Shaker/&gt; He thus derived from traditional logic a mystical type of exegetical grammar, with its own “scale” or standard for theorization, one that bears his special imprint.

==Intellectual environment==
In his official biographical account of Konya's intellectual elite, Aflākī portrayed a close-knit community of mystics and scholars of a surprisingly uninhibited spiritual mien in Konya. And yet, incessant migrations to Anatolia had given this frontier capital a distinctly cosmopolitan character, making it the envy of every seeker of knowledge—Muslim, Greek and Armenian—but also innumerable foes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Cl. Huart|last=Aflākī|title=Les saints des derviches tourneurs. Récits traduits du persan et annotés I.|location=Paris|publisher=Ernest Leroux|publication-date=1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

This was about the time when Qūnavī's father,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Claude Addas|title=Ibn 'Arabī ou La quête du Soufre Rouge|location=Paris|publisher=Editions Gallimard|publication-date=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Majd al-Dīn Isḥāq, began his career as a statesman and, reflecting mysticism's pervasiveness, acquired the status of a revered spiritual figure. On his return journey from a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, Isḥāq was accompanied by Muḥyiddīn Ibn 'Arabī, with whom he struck a deep friendship. When Isḥāq died, his companion reportedly became Ṣadr al-Dīn's stepfather by marrying the widowed mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Qārī al-Baghdādī|title=Al-Durr al-thamīn fī manāqib Muḥyī al-Dīn Ibn 'Arabī|location=Beirut|publication-date=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although we have no direct confirmation of this marriage from the writings of Ibn 'Arabî or Qūnawî we do know that Qūnawî became Ibn 'Arabî's close disciple and was given permission to teach all of his works&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chittick|first=William C.|title=The Central Point - Qūnawî's Role in the School of Ibn 'Arabî|journal=Journal of the Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi Society|volume=35|date=2004|access-date=20 Jan 2018 |url=http://www.ibnarabisociety.org/articles/centralpoint.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Anatolia's medley spiritual and cultural character at last began to take firmer shape.

To all, language was as primordial as it was central to all spiritual and mental activity. We have only to consider the linguistic innovations of mystic-poets like Rūmī, who contributed to the secular development of a highbrow literary form of Persian. Qūnavī's peculiar bent for Arabic linguistics, on the other hand, placed him comfortably in the lap of Arabic high culture, even if his mystical "exegetical grammar" must not be collapsed with conventional Arabic grammar.&lt;ref name=Shaker/&gt;

In part, Arabic provided Qūnavī with uninterrupted links with the traditional centers of learning (Damascus, Aleppo, Cairo, etc.), where the religious sciences were taught almost exclusively in the Arabic language. Numerous schools and colleges had earlier been built by the [[Ayyūbid]]s in Syria and Egypt, where Arabic was studied by people who congregated from all over the Islamic world.

In his landmark work, "al-Nafaāt al-ilāhīyah", Qūnavī noted how the matter of "al-kitābah al-ūlā al-ilāhīyah" (the primary divine writing, a key feature of his doctrine) came to him in an earlier version in the City of Damascus. Damascus, at the time, had fostered a broad intellectual fraternity that was felt across the traditional lines of [[fiqh|jurisprudence]], even if the religious sciences were more deep-rooted and variegated there than in Konya. Specialized fields like ḥadīth studies, where Qūnavī was an authority and a teacher, exhibited fewer rigid doctrinal standards of admission. One of the most prestigious centers, established earlier in the twelfth century, was the Dār al-Ḥadīth al-Ashrafīyah, whose the first shaykh was celebrated Shāfi'ī muḥaddith Ibn al-Ṣāliḥ al-Shahrazūrī (d. 643/1245). Unlike Ibn 'Arabī, who prayed as a [[Maliki|Mālikī]], Qūnavī was steeped in [[Shafi'i|Shāfi'ī]] jurisprudence, whose practitioners were abundantly represented in the schools. But while spheres of influence were more or less evenly distributed in the higher echelons of academic scholarship in centers like the Ashrafīyah, some scholars exerted an intellectual influence disproportionate to their numbers—one prominent example being [[List of Muslim historians#The historians of the classical period|Abū Shāma]], the official chronicler of Damascus who kept a close liaison with the Mālikī circles from the Maghreb and Ibn 'Arabī himself.&lt;ref name="Pouzet 179"&gt;{{cite book|last=Louis Pouzet|title=Damas au VIIe/XIIIe siècle. Vie et structures religieuses d’une métropole islamique|location=Beirut|publisher=Dar El-Machreq Sarl Editeurs|publication-date=1988|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mālikīs present a special case, because their small numbers in the schools belied their pervasive influence especially in the Quranic sciences. Their numerical preponderance in iqrā’ (Quran recital) and naḥw (grammar)&lt;ref name="Pouzet 179" /&gt; managed to sway the general interest even more toward Arabic philology. In view of his special relationship with Ibn 'Arabī, Qūnavī had easy access to their exegetical sources. Apart from themes characteristic of Ibn 'Arabī, however, there is little evidence of anything peculiarly Mālikī or Maghrebi in the works of Qūnavī, including in grammar.&lt;ref name=Shaker/&gt; His affiliations remained close to the traditional eastern centers of learning, where the Mālikīs were underrepresented. That said, Damascus was not the only place to which Qūnavī paid regular visits. He also traveled to Aleppo and Cairo, where he had a faithful following.

More intriguing is how Qūnavī's spiritual bond with Rūmī, a scholar in his own right but the self-professed opponent of bookish scholars, developed to the point of mutual admiration—according to Aflākī—as Qūnavī continued to produce works rarely equaled in the “Arabic sciences” (Huart 281-82).

==The mystical philosophy of language==
As the primary vehicle of human expression, language has the capacity to convey the most profound experiences available to human beings. For Qūnavī, its “devices of conveyance” (adawāt al-tawṣīl) disclosed “incorporeal and immaterial meanings,” which he explored at a certain remove from the original experience that presumably lay at the core. He may not have differed markedly from Rūmī in this respect, but he was not a “literary practitioner” (i.e., a poet) after the manner of Rūmī, nor was he even a grammarian by profession.&lt;ref name=Shaker/&gt;

The challenge was to take the demonstrative science of traditional philosophy toward an exegetical grammar that could act as a quintessential language of experience, where knowledge implied the obligation to instruct in the intricacies of spiritual peregrination, but without substituting this derived knowledge for direct personal experience. This model remained legitimate so long as the central fact and semantic unity of divine speech was maintained.&lt;ref name=Shaker/&gt;

What we find in the mystical reflections of Ibn 'Arabī and Qūnavī alike are encoded utterances embodying an asymmetrical division between two components of instructive knowledge. Philosophically, they consist of the mawḑū' (subject) and the maṭlūb (object of inquiry); in theological dialectics and religious sciences they are generally known as aṣl (root) and far' (branch). Thus, in Qūnavī's view the idea was not merely to posit the “root” but to know it and to determine the precise modalities of our knowledge of it. A simple, unreflective cognizance of pregiven religious fundamentals, in the manner advocated by the Salafi-minded [[Ibn Taymiyyah|Ibn Taymīyyah]], was still knowledge; yet nothing could disentangle it from the mundane influences that normally impinge upon the human faculty of comprehension.&lt;ref name=Shaker/&gt;

The central question posed in the “theological science” envisioned by Ibn Sīnā was that of “existence.” In the form of a syllogism, the theological knowledge it imparted consisted of indemonstrable premises and a conclusion. Indemonstrables were given elements in any syllogism (“givens” were posited through the senses, imagination, intellect, etc.). As a science, this grand concept of theology assembled all the pregivens derived in the lower sciences that came under its own jurisdiction, because theological science was the very ground of all sciences.&lt;ref name=Shaker/&gt;

Furthermore, Ibn Sīnā saw existence as something that required more than just a natural awareness of things. In his "Nafaḥāt ilāhiyyah," Qūnavī admitted that in that banal sense one could argue the awareness of existence was simply posited by way of intuition as the “first cognizance,” for which there was no demonstrable proof or true definition and which has merely an indistinct unity. However, this was not the biggest issue, he insisted. The difficulty arose with the “second cognizance,” namely, knowledge of the “reality distinguishable in itself from other realities”—in other words, the uniqueness of the reality.

This constituted the locus of the classical philosophical dilemma that preoccupied Qūnavī. The goal of knowledge was “knowledge of the realities of things.” One may either deny this knowledge to man, on the grounds that his natural faculties were imperfect, or affirm it at the risk of according him absolute knowledge. Contrasted to the second cognizance stood the first, which consisted of the “awareness of existence” and the perception of its “thingness.” His demarcation between this indistinct thingness and singular reality corresponded to the theological division of “subject” (mawḍūc) and “object of inquiry” (maṭlūb)—what is given and what is sought by way of knowledge. The realities, in the plural, consisted of the branches, the manifold qualities of the divine essence, by which God manifests Himself.&lt;ref name=Shaker/&gt;

Behind this structural view or formulation remained the vexing question: Should what is sought in the quest for knowledge be considered nothing but the original knowing subject revealed? Because the shay’ (thing) is given as the subject, like mawjūd (existent), the “cause of its knowledge is the predominance of that precept by which there is unity with the [thing] known, whatever it may be.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ālūsī|first=Maḥmūd Shukrī|last2=al-Hudá al-Ṣayyādī|first2=Abŭ|last3=ibn Ḥasan Wădĭ|first3=Muḥammad|title=Kitāb al-asrār al-ilāhīyah: sharḥ al-qaṣīdah al-Rafāʻīyah / taʾlīf Maḥmūd Shukrī al-Ālūsī al-Baghdādī al-Ḥusaynī al-Rafāʻī|edition=1|publisher=Jamālīyah Miṣr : al-Maṭbaʻah al-Khayrīyah|publication-date=1888}}&lt;/ref&gt; This “unity” between knower and known is what any claim to a knowledge of the reality ultimately had to rest upon; but it is a unity which indicated that we knew the reality in the manner in which it has revealed itself to the other reality, that of the knower, and is not a simple identity of two entities.

At any rate, it is the knower's radical otherness that renders any simple unity impossible. How then could we expect man, in his finitude and imperfection, to know not merely the “realities of things,” but God his Creator and the ultimate Reality? However, unity can be rendered viable, in a didactic sense, through the notion of the “consonance” between the two realities by way of their predominant attributes. This is possible only by virtue of “pre-existing knowledge.” Hence, in philosophy, the process of discovery moves procession-like from what is known to what is unknown. Every “theological science” from Aristotle's to Ibn Sīnā's to Qūnavī's—no matter how formal and however mellifluous or spiritually meager its utterances may be—accepted this rudimentary principle.&lt;ref name=Shaker/&gt;

To Qūnavī's credit, he took pains to describe the passage, or supersession, that occurred with the knowledge of the thing as a unique reality by way of a special “unity” through consonance. In other words, knowledge of it in the form of an object of inquiry or “branch.”

There is more to this than meets the eye. Movement here is not a mechanical passage from one point to the other. The possibility of transmutation, at some given level of commonality between two distinct realities (the knower and the known), is opened up through their consonance, or munāsabah.

'''Sherpa''' is one of the major [[ethnic group]]s native to the most mountainous regions of [[Nepal]], as well as certain areas of [[China]], [[Bhutan]], [[India]], and the [[Himalayas]]. The term ''sherpa'' or ''sherwa'' derives from the [[Sherpa language]] words ''Shar'' ("east") and ''Wa'' ("people"), which refer to their geographical origin in [[Tibet]].

Most Sherpa people live in the eastern regions of Nepal; however, some live farther west in the [[Rolwaling Himal|Rolwaling Valley]] and in the [[Helambu]] region north of [[Kathmandu]]. [[Tengboche]] is the oldest Sherpa village in Nepal. Sherpa people also live in [[China]], [[Bhutan]], and the Indian states of [[Sikkim]] and the northern portion of [[West Bengal]], specifically the district of [[Darjeeling]]. The [[Sherpa language]] belongs to the south branch of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages]], and it is a mixed Eastern Tibet (Khamba) and central Tibetan dialects. However, this language is separate from [[Standard Tibetan|Lhasa Tibetan]] and unintelligible to Lhasa speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/colloque/deserts/videos_gestion/nt.htm |title=Journée d'étude : Déserts.

The number of Sherpas migrating to Western countries has significantly increased in recent years, especially to the United States. [[New York City]] has the largest Sherpa community in the United States, with a population of approximately 3,000. The 2001 Nepal census recorded 154,622 Sherpas within its borders. Some members of the Sherpa population are known for their skills in [[mountaineering]].

==History==
[[File:Nepal ethnic groups.png|300px|right|thumb|Selected ethnic groups of Nepal: &lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Sherpa&lt;/span&gt;, [[Thakali people|&lt;span style="color:#660000;"&gt;Thakali&lt;/span&gt;]], [[Gurung|&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;Gurung&lt;/span&gt;]], &lt;span style="color:#ff6600;"&gt;[[Sunuwar]], Kirati&lt;/span&gt;, [[Rai (ethnic group)|&lt;span style="color:#ff6600;"&gt;Rai]]&lt;/span&gt;, [[Lohorung people|&lt;span style="color:#ff6600;"&gt;Lohorung]]&lt;/span&gt;, [[Parali|&lt;span style="color:#ff6600;"&gt;Parali]]&lt;/span&gt;, [[Bahing|&lt;span style="color:#ff6600;"&gt;Bahing]]&lt;/span&gt;, [[Limbu people|&lt;span style="color:#ff6600;"&gt;Limbu]]&lt;/span&gt;, [[Newar|&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Newar&lt;/span&gt;]], [[Pahari people|&lt;span style="color:#ffcc33;"&gt;Pahari&lt;/span&gt;]], [[Tamang|&lt;span style="color:#333366;"&gt;Tamang&lt;/span&gt;]]]]
The Sherpa were [[nomadic people]] who first settled in the [[Solukhumbu District|Solukhumbu District (Khumbu)]], [[Nepal]], then gradually moved westward along salt trade routes. According to Sherpa oral history, four groups migrated out of Solukhumbu at different times, giving rise to the four fundamental Sherpa clans: Minyagpa, Thimmi, Sertawa and Chawa. These four groups have since split into the more than 20 different clans that exist today. About 14th centuries,  Sherpa ancestors migrated from [[Kham]]. Mahayana Buddhism religious conflict may have contributed to the migration in the 13th and 14th centuries. Sherpa migrants traveled through [[Ü (region)|Ü]] and Tsang, before crossing the Himalaya.&lt;ref name="Bhandari 2015"/&gt;

By the 1400s, Khumbu Sherpa people attained autonomy within the newly formed Nepali state. In the 1960s, as tension with China increased, Nepali government influence on the Sherpa people grew. In 1976, Khumbu became a national park, and tourism became a major economic force.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Through A Sherpa Window: Illustrated Guide to Traditional Sherpa Culture|author=Sherpa, Lhakpa Norbu|publisher=Vajra Publications|year=2008|isbn=9789937506205|location=Jyatha, Thamel|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gautam (1994) concluded that the Sherpa migrated from Tibet approximately 600 years ago, through the [[Nangpa La]] pass. It is presumed that the group of people from the Kham region, east of Tibet, was called "Shyar Khamba" (People who came from eastern Kham), and the place where they settled was called "Shyar Khumbu". As the time passed, the "Shyar Khamba," inhabitants of Shyar Khumbu, were called Sherpa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tapting.org/?section=page_content&amp;action=browse&amp;page=8 |title=Tapting Samaj Sewa |publisher=Tapting.org |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent Nepal Ethnographic Museum (2001) study postulated that present-day Nepal became an integral part of the [[Nepal|kingdom of Nepal]]. Since ancient times, Sherpas, like other indigenous Kirat [[Nepal]]ese tribes, would move from one place to another place within the Himalayan region surviving as Alpine pastoralists and traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia-planet.net/nepal/museum.htm |title=Nepal Ethnographic Museum |publisher=Asia-planet.net |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
Genetic studies shows that much of the Sherpa population has [[allele frequencies]] which are often found in other Tibeto-Burman regions, in tested genes, the strongest affinity was for Tibetan population sample studies done in Xizang Tibetan Autonomous Region.&lt;ref name="Bhandari 2015"/&gt; Genetically, the Sherpa cluster closest with the sample Tibetan and Han populations.&lt;ref name="ColeCox2017"/&gt; Additionally, the Sherpa had exhibited affinity for several Nepalese populations, with the strongest for the [[Rai people]], followed by the [[Magars]] and the [[Tamang people|Tamang]].&lt;ref name="ColeCox2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cole|first1=Amy M.|last2=Cox|first2=Sean|last3=Jeong|first3=Choongwon|last4=Petousi|first4=Nayia|last5=Aryal|first5=Dhana R.|last6=Droma|first6=Yunden|last7=Hanaoka|first7=Masayuki|last8=Ota|first8=Masao|last9=Kobayashi|first9=Nobumitsu|year=2017|title=Genetic structure in the Sherpa and neighboring Nepalese populations|journal=BMC Genomics|volume=18|issue=1|pages=102|doi=10.1186/s12864-016-3469-5|pmid=28103797|pmc=5248489|issn=1471-2164|last10=Gasparini|first10=Paolo|last11=Montgomery|first11=Hugh|last12=Robbins|first12=Peter|last13=Di Rienzo|first13=Anna|last14=Cavalleri|first14=Gianpiero L.}} [[File:CC-BY_icon.svg|50x50px]] This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the [[creativecommons:by/4.0/|Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)]] license.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study of Sherpas in China suggested that a small portion of Sherpas and [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] [[allele frequencies]] originated from separate ancient populations, which was estimated to have remained somewhat distributed for 11,000 to 7,000 years.&lt;ref name="Lu 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=Dongsheng|display-authors=etal|title=Ancestral Origins and Genetic History of Tibetan Highlanders|journal=[[The American Journal of Human Genetics]]|date=September 1, 2016|volume=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Haplogroup distribution====
A 2014 study observed that considerable genetic components from the Indian Subcontinent were found in Sherpa people living in China. The western Y chromosomal haplogroups R1a1a-M17, J-M304, and F*-M89 comprise almost 17% of the paternal gene pool in tested individuals. In the maternal side, M5c2, M21d, and U from the west also count up to 8% of people in given Sherpa populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kang|first1=Longli|last2=Wang|first2=Chuan-Chao|last3=Chen|first3=Feng|last4=Yao|first4=Dali|last5=Jin|first5=Li|last6=Li|first6=Hui|date=2 January 2016|title=Northward genetic penetration across the Himalayas viewed from Sherpa people|journal=Mitochondrial DNA Part A|volume=27|issue=1|pages=342–349|doi=10.3109/19401736.2014.895986|issn=2470-1394|pmid=24617465}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a later study from 2015 did not support the results from the 2014 study; the 2015 study concluded that genetic sharing from the Indian subcontinent was highly limited;&lt;ref name="Bhandari 2015"/&gt; a 2017 study found the same.&lt;ref name="ColeCox2017"/&gt;

In a 2015 study of 582 Sherpa individuals (277 males) from China and Nepal, [[Haplogroup D-M174]] was found most frequently, followed by [[Haplogroup O-M175]], [[Haplogroup F-M89]] and [[Haplogroup K-M9]]. The [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-chromosome haplogroup]] distribution for Sherpas follow a pattern similar to that for Tibetans.&lt;ref name="Bhandari 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhandari|first1=Sushil|display-authors=etal|title=Genetic evidence of a recent Tibetan ancestry to Sherpas in the Himalayan region|journal=[[Scientific Reports]]|date=2015|volume=5|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep16249|doi=10.1038/srep16249|pages=16249|pmid=26538459|pmc=4633682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sherpa [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup|mtDNA]] distribution shows greater diversity, as [[Haplogroup A (mtDNA)|Haplogroup A]] was found most frequently, followed by [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|Haplogroup M9a]], [[Haplogroup C (mtDNA)|Haplogroup C4a]], Haplogroup M70, and [[Haplogroup D (mtDNA)|Haplogroup D]]. These haplogroups are also found in some Tibetan populations. However, two common mtDNA sub-haplogroups unique to Sherpas populations were identified: Haplogroup A15c and Haplogroup C4a3b1.&lt;ref name="Bhandari 2015"/&gt;

==Mountaineering==
[[File:Pem dorjee sherpa (2).JPG|thumb|Sherpa mountain guide [[Pem Dorjee Sherpa]] at [[Khumbu Ice Fall]]]]

Many Sherpa are highly regarded as elite mountaineers and experts in their local area. They were immeasurably valuable to early [[List of explorers|explorers]] of the [[Himalaya]]n region, serving as guides at the extreme altitudes of the peaks and passes in the region, particularly for expeditions to climb [[Mount Everest]]. Today, the term is often used by foreigners to refer to almost any guide or climbing supporter hired for [[mountaineering]] expeditions in the Himalayas, regardless of their ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;Educational Media and Technology Yearbook - Volume 36, Michael Orey, Stephanie A.

It has been speculated that part of the Sherpas' climbing ability is the result of a [[high-altitude adaptation in humans|genetic adaptation to living in high altitudes]]. Some of these adaptations include unique [[hemoglobin]]-binding capacity and doubled [[nitric oxide]] production.&lt;ref&gt;Kamler, K. (2004).

=== Deaths in 2014 Everest avalanche ===
{{main article|2014 Mount Everest avalanche}}
On 18 April 2014, a [[serac]] collapsed above the [[Khumbu Icefall]] on Mount Everest, causing an avalanche of massive chunks of ice and snow which killed 16 Nepalese guides, mostly Sherpas.&lt;ref name=NYr&gt;{{cite news|last=Krakauer|first=Jon|title=Death and Anger on Everest|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2014/04/everest-sherpas-death-and-anger.html|accessdate=24 April 2014|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=21 April 2014|quote=Of the twenty-five men hit by the falling ice, sixteen were killed, all of them Nepalis working for guided climbing teams.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 avalanche is the second deadliest disaster in Everest's history, only superseded by avalanches in the Khumbu Icefall area just a year later, on 25 April 2015, caused by a [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|magnitude 7.8 earthquake in Nepal]]. In response to that tragedy and others involving deaths and injuries sustained by Sherpas hired by climbers, and the lack of government support for Sherpas injured or killed while providing their services, some Sherpa climbing guides walked off the job, and some climbing companies are no longer providing guides and porters for Everest expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=NPR|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/04/24/306390312/sherpas-walk-off-the-job-after-avalanche-kills-16-guides|title=Sherpas Walk Off The Job After Deadly Avalanche |author=McCarthy, Julie |date=April 24, 2014 &lt;!-- 5:04 AM ET --&gt;  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sherpas Consider Boycott After Everest Disaster|author=The Associated Press|work=NPR|date=  April 21, 2014 &lt;!-- 2:03 AM ET --&gt;  |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=305178526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
[[File:Thame Gompa.JPG|thumb|[[Thame, Nepal|Thame]] Gompa is one of numerous Sherpa monasteries]]

According to oral Buddhist traditions, the initial Tibetan migration was a search for a [[beyul]] (Buddhist pure-lands). Sherpa belong to the [[Nyingmapa]], the "Ancient" school of Buddhism. Allegedly the oldest Buddhist sect in Tibet, founded by [[Padmasambhava]] (commonly known as Guru Rinpoche) during the 8th century, it emphasizes mysticism and the incorporation of local deities shared by the pre-Buddhist [[Bön|Bon religion]], which has [[shamanic]] elements. Sherpa particularly believe in hidden [[Terma (religion)|treasures]] and [[beyul|valleys]]. Traditionally, Nyingmapa practice was passed down orally through a loose network of lay practitioners. Monasteries with celibate monks and nuns, along with the belief in reincarnated spiritual leaders, are later adaptations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to Buddha and the great Buddhist divinities, the Sherpa also believe in numerous deities and demons who inhabit every mountain, cave, and forest. These have to be respected or appeased through ancient practices woven into the fabric of Buddhist ritual life. Many of the great Himalayan mountains are considered sacred. The Sherpa call Mount Everest Chomolungma and respect it as the "Mother of the World." Mount Makalu is respected as the deity Shankar (Shiva). Each clan reveres certain mountain peaks and their protective deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-04-25/when-you-call-someone-sherpa-what-does-mean|title=When you call someone a Sherpa, what does that mean?|work=Public Radio International|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Today, the day-to-day Sherpa religious affairs are presided over by lamas (Buddhist spiritual leaders) and other religious practitioners living in the villages. The village [[lama]] who presides over ceremonies and rituals can be a celibate monk or a married householder. In addition, shamans (''lhawa'') and soothsayers (''mindung'') deal with the supernatural and the spirit world. Lamas identify witches (''pem''), act as the mouthpiece of deities and spirits, and diagnose spiritual illnesses.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

An important aspect of Sherpa religion is the monastery or ''gompa''. There are some two dozen gompas scattered throughout the Solukhumbu region. They are communities of lamas or monks (sometimes of nuns) who take a vow of celibacy and lead a life of isolation searching for truth and religious enlightenment. They are respected by and supported by the community at large. Their contact with the outside world is focused on monastery practices and annual festivals to which the public is invited, as well as the reading of sacred texts at funerals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Minority religions for Sherpa is [[Hinduism]].

==Traditional clothing==
Men wear long-sleeved robes called ''kitycow'', which fall to slightly below the knee. ''Chhuba'' is tied at the waist with a cloth sash called ''kara'', creating a pouch-like space called ''tolung'' which can be used for storing and carrying small items. Traditionally, ''chhuba'' were made from thick home-spun wool, or a variant called ''lokpa'' made from sheepskin. ''Chhuba'' are worn over ''raatuk'', a blouse (traditionally made out of ''bure'', white raw silk), trousers called ''kanam'', and an outer jacket called ''tetung''.

Women traditionally wear long-sleeved floor-length dresses of thick wool called ''tongkok''. A sleeveless variation called ''angi'' is worn over a ''raatuk'' (blouse) in warmer weather. These are worn with colourful striped aprons; ''metil'' aprons are worn in front, and ''gewe'' in back, and are held together by an embossed silver buckle called ''kyetig''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|138–141}}

Sherpa clothing resembles Tibetan clothing. Increasingly, home-spun wool and silk is being replaced by factory-made material. Many Sherpa people also now wear ready-made western clothing.

==Traditional housing==
[[File:Sherpa House.JPG|thumb|Traditional Sherpa architecture, but with a steel roof.]]

When a son marries and has children, the community may help to construct a new house, as the extended family becomes too large for a single home. The neighbors often contribute food, drinks and labor to help the family. Houses are typically spaced to allow fields in between. A spiritual ceremony may be conducted at every building stage as the house must have space for deities, humans and animals. Once constructed, the house is often handed down within a family and not sold. The house style depends on the lay of the land: old river terraces, former lake beds or mountain slopes. There are stone single-story, {{frac|1|1|2}}-story (on a slope), and the two-story houses, with ample room for animals. Many well-to-do families will have an annex shrine room for sacred statues, scriptures and ritual objects. The roof is sloping and is made from local natural materials, or imported metal. There's space in the roof to allow for fire smoke to escape. There may be an internal or external [[Outhouse|outhouse]] for making compost.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|14–16}}

==Social gatherings==
"A Sherpa community will most commonly get together for a party, which is held by the host with the purpose of gaining favor with the community and neighbors". Guests are invited hours before the party will start by the host’s children to reduce the chance of rejection. The men are seated by order of status, with those of lesser status sitting closer to the door and men of higher status sitting by the fireplace, while the women sit in the center with no ordering. It is polite to sit in a space lower than one’s proper place so one may be invited by the host to their proper place. The first several hours of the party will have only beer served, followed by the serving of food, and then several more hours of singing and dancing before people start to drift out. The act of manipulating one’s neighbors into cooperation by hosting a party is known as Yangdzi, and works by expecting the hospitality done by the host with the serving of food and alcohol to be repaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Sherpas Through Their Rituals | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | author=Ortner, Sherry B. | year=1978 | location=Melbourne, Australia | pages=61–75 | isbn=978-0-521-29216-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous Sherpas==
[[File:Tenzing Norgay, 1953.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nepali people|Nepali]] Sherpa mountain climber Tenzing Norgay, 1953]]

One of the best-known Sherpas is [[Tenzing Norgay]]. In 1953, he and [[Sir Edmund Hillary]] became the first people known to have reached the summit of [[Mount Everest]].&lt;ref name="adventure"&gt;{{cite web|title=1953: First Footsteps - Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay|publisher=National Geographic|url=http://adventure.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/everest/sir-edmund-hillary-tenzing-norgay-1953/#page=2|accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christchurch"&gt;Christchurch City Libraries, [http://library.christchurch.org.nz/Kids/FamousNewZealanders/more/SirEdmundHillary.asp ''Famous New Zealanders''].

In 2001, [[Temba Tsheri]] became the youngest Everest climber in the world (holder of the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]]), then aged 16.

In 2003, Sherpas [[Pemba Dorje]] and [[Lhakpa Golu]] competed to see who could climb Everest from [[Everest Base Camp|base camp]] the fastest. On 23 May 2003, Dorje reached the summit in 12 hours and 46 minutes. Three days later, Golu beat his record by two hours, reaching the summit in 10 hours 46 minutes. On 21 May 2004, Dorje again improved the time by more than two hours with a total time of 8 hours and 10 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Everest Speed Record Upheld | publisher = EverestNews.com |url=http://www.everestnews2004.com/4002expcoverage/newseverestspeedrecord05202004-09162004.htm |accessdate=4 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous Nepalese female mountaineers was [[Pasang Lhamu Sherpa]], the first Nepali female climber to reach the summit of Everest, but who died during the descent. Her namesake, [[Pasang Lamu Sherpa Akita]], has also climbed Everest, and was one of three Nepali women who were the first to reach the summit of K2.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|magazine=[[Rock &amp; Ice]]|title=Snowball Fight on K2: Interview with Pasang Lamu Sherpa Akita|first=Alison|last=Osius|date=February 17, 2016|url=http://www.rockandice.com/climbing-news/snowball-fight-on-k2-interview-with-pasang-lhamu-sherpa-akita|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218125716/http://www.rockandice.com/climbing-news/snowball-fight-on-k2-interview-with-pasang-lhamu-sherpa-akita|archivedate=18 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-known female Sherpa was the two-time Everest summiter [[Pemba Doma Sherpa]], who died after falling from [[Lhotse]] on 22 May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6684649.stm "Famous female Nepal climber dead"], ''[[BBC News]]'', 23 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 2011, [[Mingma Sherpa (mountaineer)|Mingma Sherpa]] became the first Nepali and the first South Asian to scale all 14 of the world's highest mountains. In the process, Mingma set new world record – he became the first mountaineer to climb all 14 peaks on first attempt.

Lakpa Tsheri Sherpa is one half of a Nepali duo that was voted "People's Choice Adventurers of the Year 2012". In April 2011, Lakpa Tsheri and Sano Babu Sunuwar made the 'Ultimate Descent': a three-month journey in which they climbed Everest, then paraglided down the mountain and proceeded to kayak through Nepal and India until they reached the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Winners: Sano Babu Sunuwar and Lakpa Tsheri Sherpa|url=http://adventure.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/adventurers-of-the-year/2012/peoples-choice-lakpa-tsheri-sherpa-sano-babu-sunuwar/|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 2012, 16-year-old Nima Chhamzi Sherpa became the youngest woman to climb Everest; the previous record holder was [[Nimdoma Sherpa]], who summited in 2008, also at 16 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four Confirmed Dead in Two Day on Everest|url=http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/climbing/mountaineering/everest-2012/Five-Confirmed-Dead-in-Two-Days-on-Everest-and-Lhotse.html|accessdate=23 May 2012|date=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chhurim]] Sherpa (Nepal) summitted Everest twice in May 2012:  12 May and 19 May.  ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' recognized her for being the first female Sherpa to summit [[Everest]] twice in one climbing season.

In 2013, 30-year-old [[Chhang Dawa Sherpa]] became the youngest mountaineer to summit the 14 highest peaks, the [[Eight-thousander|8000'ers]].
 
[[Pratima Sherpa]] 19(2017), has lived her entire life in a maintenance shed on the fourth hole of Royal Nepal [[Golf]] Club in Kathmandu, and is the top-ranked female golfer in [[Nepal]].

On July 26, 2014, [[Pasang Lamu Sherpa Akita]], Dawa Yangzum Sherpa, and [[Maya Sherpa]] crested the 28,251-foot (8,611-meter) summit of [[K2]], the second highest mountain in the world. In doing so, the three Nepali women have become the first all-female team to climb what many mountaineers consider a much tougher challenge than Everest. The feat was announced in climbing circles as a breakthrough achievement for women in high-altitude mountaineering. Only 18 of the 376 people who have summited K2 have been women.

Another notable Sherpa is [[cross-country skier]] and [[ultramarathoner]] [[Dachhiri Sherpa]], who represented Nepal at the 2006, 2010, and 2014 [[Winter Olympics]].

Similarly Cultural and tourism Minister of Nepal [[Kripasur Sherpa]], Major of British Gurkha Army [[Prem Dorji Sherpa]], ambassador of Australia [[Lucky Sherpa]] are notable personnels from Sherpa communities.

[[Bir Radha Sherpa]] has won many titles in Indian reality dance championship awards.

Various leaders of Sufi orders, [[Tariqa]], chartered the first organized activities to introduce localities to Islam through Sufism. Saint figures and mythical stories provided solace and inspiration to Hindu caste communities often in rural villages of [[India]].&lt;ref name="Jafri 2006 4"/&gt; The Sufi teachings of divine spirituality, cosmic harmony, love, and humanity resonated with the common people and still does so today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zargar|first=Cyrus Ali|title=Introduction to Islamic Mysticism|accessdate=7 March 2013|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Islam |volume=2 |first=Peter Malcolm |last=Holt |author2=Ann K.

==Early history==

===Influence of Islam===
Muslims entered India in 711 under the Arab commander [[Muhammad bin Qasim]], by conquering the regions of Sindh and Multan. This historical achievement connected South Asia to the Muslim empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schimmel|first=Anniemarie|title=Mystical Dimensions of Islam|year=1975|publisher=University of North Carolina|location=Chapel Hill|page=344|chapter=Sufism in Indo-Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alvi|first=Sajida Sultana|title=Perspectives on Mughal India: Rulers, Historians, Ulama, and Sufis|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Karachi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, Arab Muslims were welcomed along the Hindustani (India) sea ports for trade and business ventures.  The Muslim culture of the caliphate began to permeate through India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Michael Hamilton|title=Lost History: The Enduring Legacy of Muslim Scientists, Thinkers, Artists|year=2007|publisher=National Geographic|location=Washington D.C.|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Sindh 700ad.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Muslims conquered Multan, the capital of Sindh, and thereby expanded the Islamic empire into India.]] This trade route linking India to the Mediterranean world and even Southeast Asia lasted peacefully until 900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walsh|first=Judith E.|title=A Brief History of India|year=2006|publisher=State University of New York|location=Old Westbury}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the Abbasid Caliphate (750 – 1258) was seated in Baghdad; this city is also the birthplace of Sufism with notable figures such as [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], [[Hasan al Basri]], and [[Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya|Rabiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Cyrus Ali Zargar&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walsh|first=Judith E.|title=A Brief History of India|year=2006|publisher=State University of New York|location=Old Wesbury|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mystic tradition of Islam gained significant ground spreading from Baghdad (Iraq) into Persia, commonly known today as Iran and Afghanistan. In 901, a Turkic military leader, [[Sabuktigin]], established an Afghan kingdom in the city of Ghaznah.  His son, [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Mahmud]], expanded their territories into the Indian Punjab region during 1027&lt;ref&gt;Walsh p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The resources and riches annexed from Punjab went into the Ghazni coffers to expand further into India's northwest areas.&lt;ref name="Alvi"&gt;Alvi&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 11th century, the [[Ghaznavids]] brought a wealth of scholars into India's borders, establishing the first Persian-inspired Muslim culture succeeding prior Arab influences.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1151, another Central Asian group, called the [[Ghurids]], overtook the lands of the Ghaznavids – who did very little to monitor their lands in India.&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;Walsh&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mu'izz-ad-din|Mu’izz al-Din Ghuri]], a governor of Turkic origin, initiated a major invasion of India, extending the previous Ghazni territories into Delhi and Ajmer. By 1186, northern India was indistinguishable; a combination of Baghdad's cosmopolitan culture mixed with Persian-Turkic traditions of the Ghaznah court accelerated Sufi intellectualism in India.&lt;ref&gt;Alvi 46&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars, poets, and mystics from Central Asia and Iran became integrated within India. By 1204, the Ghurids established rule in the following cities: Benaras (Varanasi), Kanaug, Rajasthan, and Bihar, which introduced Muslim rule into the Bengal region.&lt;ref name="Alvi"/&gt;

An emphasis on translation of Arabic and Persian texts (Qu'ran, Hadith corpus, Sufi literature) into vernacular languages helped the momentum of Islamization in India.&lt;ref&gt;Alvi 10&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in rural areas, Sufis helped Islam spread generously into prior polytheistic populations. Subsequently, the general consensus among scholars remains that there were never any forced mass conversions recorded during this early history time period.&lt;ref name="Alvi 9"&gt;Alvi 9&lt;/ref&gt; Between the late 12th century and 13th century, Sufi brotherhoods became firmly consolidated in northern India.&lt;ref name="Schimmel 345"&gt;Schimmel 345&lt;/ref&gt;
Sufism  came to Kashmir when Sufi Saint, Shai Karman, from the Iranian city of  Karman, took up residence in a small village called Sharakaware(baramulla). From Sharakawara, the religion spread to other villages like Pangipora and nawshere.they took initiative to spread the Islamic teaching among common people.

===Delhi Sultanate===

The period of 1206 – 1526 is labeled as the [[Delhi Sultanate of Raftaar]].&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 78&lt;/ref&gt; This time frame consists of five separate dynasties that ruled territorial parts of India: the [[Mamluk Dynasty (Delhi)|Mamluk]] or slave, [[Khalji dynasty|Khaljis]], [[Tughlaq dynasty|Tughlaq]], [[Sayyid Dynasty|Sayyid]], and [[Lodi Dynasty|Lodi dynasty]]. In history, the Delhi Sultanate is usually given marginal attention compared to the succeeding [[Mughal Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Aquil"&gt;Aquil&lt;/ref&gt;  At its peak, the Delhi Sultanate controlled all of North India, Afghan frontier, and Bengal. The security of their lands protected India from the [[Mongol Conquests]] terrorizing the rest of Asia between 1206 and 1294.&lt;ref name="Zargar"&gt;Zargar&lt;/ref&gt; The Mongols also succeeded in destroying Baghdad, the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate, proving that this reign of violence was no minor feat.{{According to whom|date=June 2013}}  When the Mongol invasion penetrated Central Asia, fleeing refugees chose India as a safe destination.&lt;ref&gt;morgan77&lt;/ref&gt;  
This historical move can be deemed{{By whom|date=June 2013}} a significant catalyst of Sufi thought in India. Scholars, students, artisans, and common people arrived into the protection of Mamluk rulers, the first dynasty in the Delhi Sultanate. Soon the court had an immense influx of diverse cultures, religiosity, and literature from Persia and Central Asia; [[Sufism]] was the main ingredient in all mediums. During this medieval period, Sufism spread through various regions, expanding to the Deccan plateau with the succession of the Tughlaq dynasty of 1290 – 1388.&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aquil 9&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the Muslim rulers of the Sultanate dynasties were not necessarily of orthodox [[Islam]]; yet, they were still deemed powerful. Advisors of the dynastic sultans included Muslim religious scholars (ulama) and notably, Muslim mystics (mashai’kh).&lt;ref&gt;Aquil 11&lt;/ref&gt; Although practicing Sufis rarely had political aspirations, the declining ethical reign of the Sayyid and Lodi dynasty (1414 – 1517) required renewed leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Aquil 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of Education==

===Traditional Culture===

During 901 - 1151, the Ghaznawids began to build numerous schools called [[madrasa]] that were attached and affiliated with masjids ([[mosque]]). This mass movement established stability in India's educational systems.&lt;ref name="Alvi 9"/&gt; Existing scholars promoted the study of the Qu'ran and [[hadith]], beginning in North West India.&lt;ref&gt;Alvi 11&lt;/ref&gt; During the Delhi Sultanate, the intellectual caliber of India's residents increased multiple - fold due to the Mongol invasions.  Various intellectuals hailing from regions such as Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asia began to enrich the cultural and literary life of the Delhi capital.&lt;ref&gt;Alvi 12&lt;/ref&gt; Among the religious elite existing during the Sultanate time period, two major classifications existed. The ''ulama'' were noted exclusive religious scholars who had mastered certain Islamic legal branches of study.  They were [[sharia]] oriented and tended to be more orthodox about Muslim practices. The other group of religious elites were the Sufi mystics, or [[fakir]]. This was a more inclusive group that was often more tolerant of non-Muslim traditions. Although the commitment to practice [[sharia]] remains a Sufi foundation, early Sufis in India focused on proselytizing through service work and helping the poor. During the Delhi Sultanate, the rise prevailing mystical approach to Islam was not a substitute for [[madrasa]] education nor traditional scholarship.&lt;ref name="Alvi 14"&gt;Alvi 14&lt;/ref&gt; The teachings of [[sufism]] only built upon the foundations of a madrasa education. The spiritual orientation of Sufism only sought to refine the "consciousness of the divine, intensify piety, and inculcate a humanistic attitude."&lt;ref name="Alvi 14"/&gt;

===Sufi Khanqah===

One reason why [[Islam]] became more favorable in India was due to the establishment of [[khanqah]]. A khanqah is commonly defined as a hospice, lodge, community center, or dormitory ran by Sufis.&lt;ref name="Alvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zargar"/&gt; Khanqahs were also known as [[Jama'at Khana]], large gathering halls.&lt;ref name="Aquil"/&gt; Structurally, a khanqah could be one large room or have additional dwelling space.&lt;ref name="Schimmel 345"/&gt;  Although some khanqah establishments were independent of royal funding or patronage, many received fiscal grants ([[waqf]]) and donations from benefactors for continuing services.&lt;ref name="Alvi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the function of traditional Sufi khanqahs evolved as Sufism solidified in India.

Initially, the Sufi khanqah life emphasized a close and fruitful relationship between the master-teacher ([[sheikh]]) and their students.&lt;ref name="Alvi 14"/&gt;  For example, students in khanqahs would pray, worship, study, and read works together.&lt;ref name="Schimmel 347"&gt;Schimmel 347&lt;/ref&gt;  Sufi literature  had more academic concerns besides just the jurisprudential and theological works seen in [[madrasa]].&lt;ref name="Alvi 14"/&gt;  There were three major categories of mystical works studied in South Asia: hagiographical writing, discourses of the teacher, and letters of the master.&lt;ref name="Alvi 14"/&gt; Sufis also studied various other manuals describing code of conduct, [[adab (Islam)]]. In fact, the text (trans.) "Path of God's Bondsmen from Origin to Return" written by a Persian Sufi saint, Najm al-Din Razi, spread throughout India during the authors' lifetime.&lt;ref name="Zargar"/&gt;  Sharing that Sufi thought was becoming increasingly favorable to study in India. Even today, preserved mystical literature has proved invaluable as a source of religious and social history of Sufi Muslims in India.&lt;ref name="Alvi 14"/&gt;

The other major function of a khanqah was of a community shelter. Many of these facilities were built in low caste, rural, Hindu vicinities.&lt;ref name="Aquil"/&gt; The Chishti Order Sufis in India, especially, crystallized khanqahs with the highest form of modest hospitality and generosity.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel 232&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping a "visitors welcome" policy, khanqahs in India offered spiritual guidance, psychological support, and counseling that was free and open to all people.&lt;ref name="Alvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schimmel 345"/&gt; The spiritually hungry and depressed caste members were both fed with a free kitchen service and provided basic education.&lt;ref name="Aquil"/&gt; By creating egalitarian  communities within stratified caste systems, Sufis successfully spread their teachings of love, spirituality, and harmony.  It was this example of Sufi brotherhood and equity that drew people to the religion of Islam.&lt;ref name="Aquil"/&gt; Soon these khanqahs became social, cultural, and theological epicenters for people of all ethnic and religious backgrounds and both genders.&lt;ref name="Alvi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel 231&lt;/ref&gt; Through a khanqah's humble services, Sufis presented the true form of Islam and forged a way for voluntary large scale conversions of lower class Hindustanis.&lt;ref&gt;Aquil 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sufi Tariqahs==

===Madariyya===
The [[Madariyya]] are members of a Sufi order (tariqa) popular in North India, especially in Uttar Pradesh, the Mewat region, Bihar and Bengal, as well as in Nepal and Bangladesh. Known for its syncretic aspects, lack of emphasis on external religious practice and focus on internal dhikr, it was initiated by the Sufi saint 'Sayed Badiuddin Zinda Shah Madar' (d. 1434 CE), called "Qutb-ul-Madar", and is centered on his shrine (dargah) at [[Makanpur]], Kanpur district, Uttar Pradesh.

===Shadhiliyya===
{{main|Shadhili}}
[[File:Maqbara.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[Madurai Maqbara]], the tomb of Shadhili Sufi saints in [[Madurai]], India.]]   
Shadhiliyya was founded by Imam Nooruddeen Abu Al Hasan Ali Ash Sadhili Razi. Fassiya branch of Shadhiliyya was flourished by Qutbul Ujood [[Imam Fassi]] at Masjid al Haram Makkah as its base and was brought to India by Sheikh Aboobakkar Miskeen sahib Radiyallah of [[Kayalpatnam]] and Sheikh Mir Ahmad Ibrahim Raziyallah of [[Madurai]]. Mir Ahmad Ibrahim is the first of the three Sufi [[wali|saints]] revered at the [[Madurai Maqbara]] in [[Tamil Nadu]]. There are more than 70 branches of Shadhiliyya and in [[India]]. Of these, the Fassiyatush Shadhiliyya is the most widely practised order.&lt;ref name="Shazuli.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shazuli.com |title=Fassiyathush Shazuliya &amp;#124; tariqathush Shazuliya &amp;#124; Tariqa Shazuliya &amp;#124; Sufi Path &amp;#124; Sufism &amp;#124; Zikrs &amp;#124; Avradhs &amp;#124; Daily Wirdh &amp;#124; Thareeqush shukr &amp;#124;Kaleefa's of the tariqa &amp;#124; Sheikh Fassy &amp;#124; Ya Fassy &amp;#124; Sijl &amp;#124; Humaisara &amp;#124; Muridheens &amp;#124; Prostitute Entering Paradise |publisher=Shazuli.com |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chishtiyyah===
{{main|Chishti Order}}
[[File:Nizamuddin Dargah and Jamaat Khana Masjid, Delhi.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Nizamuddin Auliya]]'s tomb (right) and [[Jama'at Khana]] Masjid (background), at [[Nizamuddin Dargah]] complex, in [[Nizamuddin West]], [[Delhi]]]]
The Chishtiyya order emerged from Central Asia and Persia. The first saint was [[Abu Ishaq Shami]] (d. 940–41) establishing the Chishti order in Chisht-i-Sharif within [[Afghanistan]]&lt;ref name="Durán 204"&gt;{{cite book |title=Children of Abraham: An Introduction to Islam for Jews |first=Khalid |last=Durán |authorlink=Khalid Duran |author2=Reuven Firestone |author3=Abdelwahab Hechiche  |publisher=Harriet and Robert Heilbrunn Institute for International Interreligious Understanding, American Jewish Committee |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Chishtiyya took root with the notable saint [[Moinuddin Chishti]] (d. 1236) who championed the order within India, making it one of the largest orders in India today.&lt;ref name="Alvi 13"&gt;Alvi 13&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars also mentioned that he had been a part-time disciple of Abu Najib Suhrawardi.&lt;ref name="Schimmel 346"&gt;Schimmel 346&lt;/ref&gt; Khwaja Moiuddin Chishti was originally from Sistan (eastern Iran, southwest Afghanistan) and grew up as a well traveled scholar to Central Asia, Middle East, and South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Aquil 6&lt;/ref&gt; He reached Delhi in 1193 during the end of Ghurid reign, then shortly settled in Ajmer-Rajasthan when the Delhi Sultanate formed.&lt;ref name="Schimmel 345"/&gt; Moinuddin Chishti's Sufi and social welfare activities dubbed Ajmer the "nucleus for the Islamization  of central and southern India."&lt;ref name="Schimmel 346"/&gt; The Chishti order formed [[khanqah]] to reach the local communities, thus helping Islam spread with charity work. Islam in India grew with the efforts of dervishes, not with violent bloodshed or forced conversion.&lt;ref name="Schimmel 345"/&gt;  Chishtis were famous for establishing khanqahs and for their simple teachings of humanity, peace, and generosity.  This group drew an unprecedented amount of Hindus of lower and higher castes within the vicinity.&lt;ref name="Schimmel 346"/&gt;  Until this day, both Muslims and non-Muslims visit the famous tomb of Moinuddin Chishti; it has become even a popular tourist and pilgrimage destination.  Jalaluddin Muhammad [[Akbar]] (d. 1605), the 3rd Mughal ruler frequented Ajmer as a pilgrim, setting a tradition for his constituents.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh 80&lt;/ref&gt;
Successors of Khwaja Moinudden Chishti include eight additional saints; together, these names are considered the big eight of the medieval Chishtiyya order.

===Suhrwardi===
{{main|Suhrawardiyya}}
The founder of this order was Abdul-Wahid Abu Najib as-Suhrawardi (d. 1168).&lt;ref name="Schimmel 245"&gt;Schimmel 245&lt;/ref&gt; He was actually a disciple of [[Ahmad Ghazali]], who is also the younger brother of Abu Hamid Ghazali.  The teachings of Ahmad Ghazali led to the formation of this order.  This order was prominent in medieval Iran prior to Persian migrations into India during the Mongol Invasion &lt;ref name="Zargar"/&gt;
Consequently, it was Abu Najib as-Suhrawardi's nephew that helped bring the Suhrawardiyyah to mainstream awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Zargar, Schimmel&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Hafs Umar as-Suhrawardi (d. 1243) wrote numerous treatises on Sufi theories.  Most notably, the text trans. "Gift of Deep Knowledge: Awa’rif al-Mar’if" was so widely read that it became a standard book of teaching in Indian madrasas.&lt;ref name="Schimmel 245"/&gt;  This helped spread the Sufi teachings of the Suhrawardiyya.  Abu Hafs was a global ambassador of his time. From teaching in Baghdad to diplomacy between the Ayyubid rulers in Egypt and Syria, Abu Hafs was a politically involved Sufi leader. By keeping cordial relations with the Islamic empire, Abu Hafs's followers in India continued to approve of his leadership and approve political participation of Sufi orders.&lt;ref name="Schimmel 245"/&gt;

===Kubrawiyyah===
This order was founded by Abu'l Jannab Ahmad, nicknamed [[Najmuddin Kubra]] (d. 1221) who was from the border between Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel 254&lt;/ref&gt; This Sufi saint was a widely acclaimed teacher with travels to Turkey, Iran, and Kashmir.  His education also fostering generations of students who became saints themselves.&lt;ref name="Zargar"/&gt; This order became important in Kashmir during the late 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel 255&lt;/ref&gt; Kubra and his students made significant contributions to Sufi literature with mystical treatises, mystical psychology, and instructional literature such as text "al-Usul al-Ashara" and "Mirsad ul Ibad."&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel 256, Zargar&lt;/ref&gt; These popular texts regarding are still mystic favorites in India and in frequent study. The [[Kubrawiya]] remains in Kashmir - India and within Huayy populations in China.&lt;ref name="Zargar"/&gt;

===Naqshbandiyyah===
{{main|Naqshbandi}}
The origin of this order can be traced back to [[Yusuf Hamadani|Khwaja Ya‘qub Yusuf al-Hamadani]] (d. 1390), who lived in [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name="Zargar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lal 4203"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopædia of Indian literature |volume=5 |first=Mohan |last=Lal |page=4203}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later organized by [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari|Baha’uddin Naqshband]] (b. 1318–1389) of Tajik and Turkic background.&lt;ref name="Zargar"/&gt; He is widely referred to as the  founder of the Naqshbandi order. Khwaja Muhammad al-Baqi Billah Berang (d. 1603) introduced the Naqshbandiyyah to India.&lt;ref name="Zargar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alvi 13"/&gt; This order was particularly popular Mughal elites due to ancestral links to the founder, Khawja al-Hamadani&lt;ref name="Oxford islamic studies"&gt;{{cite web|first=Kazuo|last=Ohtsuka| url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0759#IndianSubcontinent |accessdate=2010-02-11|title=Sufism|work=''OxfordIslamicStudies.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''&lt;ref&gt;Alvi 15&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Babur]], the founder of the Mughal dynasty in 1526, was already initiated in the Naqshbandi order prior to conquering [[India]]. This royal affiliation gave considerable impetus to the order.{{ref|Rizvi}}&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt;
This order has been considered as '''most orthodox among all sufi orders'''.

===Qadiriyyah===
{{main|Qadiriyyah}}
The Qadiriyyah order was founded by [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]] who was originally from Iran (d. 1166)&lt;ref name="Zargar"/&gt; It is popular among the Muslims of [[South India]].&lt;ref name=tombs48&gt;[[Dru Gladney|Gladney, Dru]].

===Mujahhidiyyah===
Less accurate information is known about the following other orders within India: Mujahhidiyyah.

=== Sarwari Qadri ===
{{main|Sarwari Qadiri}}
The Sarwari Qadri order was founded by [[Sultan Bahu]] which branched out of the Qadiriyyah order. Hence, it follows the same approach of the order but unlike most Sufi orders, it does not follow a specific dress code, seclusion, or other lengthy exercises. Its mainstream philosophy is related directly to the heart and contemplating on the name of Allah, i.e., the word الله (''allāh'') as written on own heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sult̤ān Bāhū, Jamal J. Elias|title=Death Before Dying: The Sufi Poems of Sultan Bahu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GlECx1j0B4IC|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-92046-0}}=&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sufi Culture==

===Syncretic Mysticism===
Islam was not the only religion in India contributing the mystical aspects of Sufism. The Bhakti movement also gained respect due mysticism popularity spreading through India. The Bhakti movement was a regional revival of Hinduism linking language, geography, and cultural identities through devotional deity worship.&lt;ref name="Walsh 64"&gt;Walsh 64&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of "[[Bhakti]]" appeared in the Bhagavad Gita and the first sects emerged from south India between the 7th and 10th century.&lt;ref name="Walsh 64"/&gt; The practices and theological standpoints were very similar to Sufism, often blurring the distinction between Hindus and Muslims. Bhakti devotees linked [[puja (Hinduism)]] to songs about saints and theories of life; they would meet often to sing and worship. The Brahman Bhaktis developed mystical philosophies similar to those advocated by Sufi saints. For example, the Bhaktis believed that there is a special reality beneath the illusion of life; this reality needs to be recognized to escape the cycle of reincarnation. Moreover, [[moksha]], liberation from Earth is the ultimate goal in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh 66&lt;/ref&gt;  These teachings run nearly parallel to Sufi concepts of [[dunya]], [[tariqa]], and [[akhirah]].

Sufism helped the assimilation of the Afghani Delhi Sultanate rulers within mainstream society.  By building a syncretic medieval culture tolerant and appreciative of non-Muslims, Sufi saints contributed to a growth of stability, vernacular literature, and devotional music in India.&lt;ref name="Aquil 34"&gt;Aquil 34&lt;/ref&gt; One Sufi mystic, Saiyid Muhammad Ghaus Gwaliori popularized yogic practices among Sufi circles.&lt;ref&gt;Aquil 35&lt;/ref&gt; Literature related to monotheism and the Bhakti movement also formed sycretic influences in history during the Sultanate period.&lt;ref&gt;Aquil 10&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the camaraderie between Sufi saints, yogis, and Bhakti Brahmans, medieval religious existed and continue to splinter peaceful living in parts of India today.&lt;ref name="Aquil 34"/&gt;

===Rituals===
One of the most popular rituals in Sufism is the visiting of grave-tombs of Sufi saints.  These have evolved into Sufi shrines and are seen among cultural and religious landscape of India. The ritual of visiting any place of significance is called [[ziyarat]]; the most common example is a visit to Prophet [[Muhammad]]'s Masjid Nabawi and grave in Medina, Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;Schlemiel 238&lt;/ref&gt;  A saint's tomb is a site of great veneration where blessings or [[barakah|baraka]] continue to reach the deceased holy person and are deemed (by some) to benefit visiting devotees and pilgrims. In order to show reverence to Sufi saints, kings and nobles provided large donations or [[waqf]] to preserve the tombs and renovate them architecturally.&lt;ref&gt;The Islamic Path: Sufism, Politics, and Society in India (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  Over time, these donation, rituals, annual commemorations formed into an elaborate system of accepted norms. These forms of Sufi practise created an aura of spiritual and religious traditions around prescribed dates.&lt;ref name="The Islamic Path 2006"&gt;The Islamic Path: Sufism, Politics, and Society in India. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Many orthodox or Islamic purists denounce these visiting grave rituals, especially the expectation of receiving blessings from the venerated saints. Nevertheless, these rituals have survived generations and seem adamant to remain.&lt;ref name="The Islamic Path 2006"/&gt;

===Musical Influence===
Music has always been present as a rich tradition among all Indian religions.&lt;ref name="The Islamic Path p.15"&gt;The Islamic Path: Sufism, Politics, and Society in India p.15 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; As an influential medium to disperse ideas, music has appealed to people for generations.  The audience in India was already familiar with hymns in local languages.  Thus Sufi devotional singing was instantly successful among the populations.  Music transmitted Sufi ideals seamlessly.  In Sufism, the term music is called "sa'ma" or literary audition.  This is where poetry would be sung to instrumental music; this ritual would often put Sufis into spiritual ecstasy.  The common depiction of whirling dervishes dressed in white cloaks come to picture when paired with "sa'ma."&lt;ref name="The Islamic Path p.15"/&gt; Many Sufi traditions encouraged  poetry and music as part of education. Sufism spread widely with their teachings packaged in popular songs accessing mass demographics. Women were especially affected; often used to sing Sufi songs during the day and in female gatherings.&lt;ref name="Schimmel 347"/&gt;  Sufi gatherings today are known as [[qawwali]]. One of the biggest contributors to the musical Sufi tradition was Amir Khusro (d. 1325).  Known as a disciple of Nizamuddin Chishti, Amir was known as the most talented musical poet in the early Muslim period of India.  He is considered the founder of Indo-Muslim devotional music traditions. Nicknamed "Parrot of India," Amir Khusro furthered the Chishti affiliation through this rising Sufi pop culture within India.&lt;ref name="The Islamic Path p.15"/&gt;

==Impact of Sufism==
The massive geographic presence of Islam in India can be explained by the tireless activity of Sufi preachers.&lt;ref name="Schimmel 240"&gt;Schimmel 240&lt;/ref&gt; Sufism had left a prevailing impact on religious, cultural, and social life in South Asia.The mystical form of Islam was introduced by Sufi saints.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge history of Southeast Asia: From early times to c. 1800 By [[Nicholas Tarling]]|Page 29|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rOw8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=Sufism+and+Its+Impact+on+Muslim+Society+in+South+Asia&amp;client=opera&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;  Sufi scholars traveling from all over continental Asia were instrumental and influential in the social, economic, and philosophic development of India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Regional/Islamabad/11-Jul-2008/Saints-played-vital-role-in-spreading-Islam Role of Sufis in Spreading Islam]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Islamic Path: Sufism, Politics, and Society in India (2006) p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; Besides preaching in major cities and centers of intellectual thought, Sufis reached out to poor and marginalized rural communities and preached in local dialects such as Urdu, Sindhi, Panjabi versus Persian, Turkish, and Arabic.&lt;ref name="Schimmel 240"/&gt; Sufism emerged as a "moral and comprehensive socio-religious force" that even influenced other religious traditions such as Hinduism.,&lt;ref name="Medieval Islamic Civilization"&gt;Medieval Islamic Civilization: L-Z, index By Josef W.

Their teachings of humanity, love for God and Prophet continue to be surrounded by mystical tales and folk songs today.&lt;ref name="Schimmel 240"/&gt; Sufis were firm in abstaining from religious and communal conflict and strived to be peaceful elements of civil society.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Furthermore, it is the attitude of accommodation, adaptation, piety, and charisma that continues to help Sufism remain as a pillar of mystical Islam in India.

'''Sādhana''' (Sanskrit साधन; {{bo|t=སྒྲུབ་ཐབས་|s=druptap}}; {{cjkv|c=修行}}), literally "a means of accomplishing something",&lt;ref&gt;V. S. Apte. ''A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary''. p. 979.&lt;/ref&gt; is a generic term coming from the [[yoga|yogic]] tradition and it refers to any [[spiritual practice|spiritual exercise]] that is aimed at progressing the [[sādhaka]] towards the very ultimate expression of his or her life in this reality.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin.  ''An Introduction to Hinduism''. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 1996. pp. 92, 156, 160, 167. {{ISBN|0-521-43878-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a variety of disciplines in [[Hinduism|Hindu]],&lt;ref&gt;NK Brahma, Philosophy of Hindu Sādhanā, {{ISBN|978-8120333062}}, pages ix-x&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism|Buddhist]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Sādhanā&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jainism|Jain]]&lt;ref&gt;C.C. Shah, Cultural and Religious Heritage of India: Jainism, Mittal, {{ISBN|81-7099-9553}}, page 301&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sikhism|Sikh]] traditions that are followed in order to achieve various [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[ritual]] objectives.

''Sādhana'' can also refer to a [[tantra|tantric]] liturgy or liturgical manual, that is, the instructions to carry out a certain practice.

A contemporary spiritual teacher and yogi [[Sadhguru]] defines sādhanā thusly:&lt;ref&gt;http://isha.sadhguru.org/blog/yoga-meditation/demystifying-yoga/the-what-why-of-sadhana/&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Everything can be sadhana. The way you eat, the way you sit, the way you stand, the way you breathe, the way you conduct your body, mind and your energies and emotions – this is sadhana. Sadhana does not mean any specific kind of activity, sadhana means you are using everything as a tool for your wellbeing.}}

The historian N. Bhattacharyya provides a working definition of the benefits of sādhanā as follows:
{{quote|[R]eligious ''sādhana'', which both prevents an excess of worldliness and molds the mind and disposition (''bhāva'') into a form which develops the knowledge of dispassion and [[detachment (philosophy)|non-attachment]]. ''Sādhanā'' is a means whereby bondage becomes liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharyya, N. N. ''History of the Tantric Religion''. Second Revised Edition. (Manohar: New Delhi, 1999) p. 174. {{ISBN|81-7304-025-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[B. K. S. Iyengar]] (1993: p.&amp;nbsp;22), in his English translation of and commentary to the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'', defines sādhana in relation to [[abhyāsa]] and [[kriyā]]:
{{quote|''Sādhana'' is a discipline undertaken in the pursuit of a goal. ''Abhyāsa'' is repeated practice performed with observation and reflection. ''Kriyā'', or action, also implies perfect execution with study and investigation. Therefore, ''sādhanā'', ''abhyāsa'', and ''kriyā'' all mean one and the same thing. A ''sādhaka'', or practitioner, is one who skillfully applies...mind and intelligence in practice towards a spiritual goal.&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, B.K.S. (1993, 2002). ''Light on the Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali''. Hammersmith, London, UK: Thorsons. {{ISBN|978-0-00-714516-4}} p.22&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Paths ==
The term sādhanā means spiritual exertion towards an intended goal. A person undertaking such a practice is known in Sanskrit as a [[sadhu|sādhu]] (female ''sādhvi''), [[sādhaka]] (female ''sādhakā'') or [[yogi]] (Tibetan ''[[pawo]]''; feminine [[yogini]] or [[dakini]], Tibetan ''khandroma''). The goal of sādhanā is to attain some level of spiritual realization, which can be either [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], pure love of God (prema), liberation ([[moksha]]) from the cycle of birth and death ([[saṃsāra]]), or a particular goal such as the blessings of a deity as in the [[Bhakti]] traditions.

Sādhana can involve [[meditation]], chanting of [[mantra]] sometimes with the help of [[prayer beads]], [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]] to a deity, [[yajña]], and in very rare cases [[mortification of the flesh]] or tantric practices such as performing one's particular ''sādhana'' within a cremation ground.

Traditionally in some Hindu and Buddhist traditions in order to embark on a specific path of sādhana, a [[guru]] may be required to give the necessary instructions. This approach is typified by some Tantric traditions, in which initiation by a guru is sometimes identified as a specific stage of sādhana.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharyya, op. cit., p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, individual renunciates may develop their own spiritual practice without participating in organized groups.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin.  ''An Introduction to Hinduism''. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 1996. p. 92. {{ISBN|0-521-43878-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tantric ''sādhana'' ==

The tantric rituals are called "''sādhana''". Some of the well known ''sādhana-s'' are:

# ''[[Shava sadhana|śāva sādhana]]'' (''sādhana'' done while visualizing sitting on a corpse).
# ''śmaśāna sādhanā'' (''sādhana'' done while visualizing being in a crematorium or cremation ground).
# ''pañca-muṇḍa sādhanā'' (''sādhana'' done while visualizing sitting on a seat of five skulls).

== Buddhism ==
In [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna Buddhism]] and the [[Nalanda]] tradition, there are fifteen major tantric ''sādhanās'':
# [[Shurangama Mantra|Śūraṅgama]]/[[Sitatapatra|Sitātapatrā]]
# [[Nīlakaṇṭha Dhāraṇī|Nīlakaṇṭha]]
# [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tārā]]
# [[Mahākāla]]
# [[Hayagriva|Hayagrīva]]
# [[Amitābha]]
# [[Bhaisajyaguru|Bhaiṣajyaguru]]/[[Akshobhya|Akṣobhya]]
# [[Guhyasamāja Tantra|Guhyasamāja]]
# [[Vajrayogini|Vajrayoginī]]/[[Vajravārāhī]]
# [[Heruka]]/[[Cakrasaṃvara Tantra|Cakrasaṃvara]]
# [[Yamantaka|Yamāntaka]]
# [[Kalachakra|Kālacakra]]
# [[Hevajra]]
# [[Chöd]]
# [[Vajrapani|Vajrapāṇi]]
#
Not within this list but a central [[sādhanā]] in [[Vajrayana]] is that of [[Vajrasattva]].

All of these are available in Tibetan form, many are available in Chinese and some are still extant in ancient Sanskrit manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uwest.edu/sanskritcanon/dp/index.php?q=node/15 Digital Sanskrit Buddhist Canon – University of the West Archives of Ancient Sanskrit Manuscripts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612171717/http://www.uwest.edu/sanskritcanon/dp/index.php?q=node%2F15 |date=2010-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Per Kværne|Kværne]] (1975: p.&amp;nbsp;164) in his extended discussion of [[sahaja|sahajā]], treats the relationship of sādhanā to [[mandala]] thus:
{{Quote|[E]xternal ritual and internal sādhanā form an indistinguishable whole, and this unity finds its most pregnant expression in the form of the mandala, the sacred enclosure consisting of concentric squares and circles drawn on the ground and representing that adamantine plane of being on which the aspirant to Buddhahood wishes to establish himself. The unfolding of the tantric ritual depends on the mandala; and where a material mandala is not employed, the adept proceeds to construct one mentally in the course of his meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Kvaerne, Per (1975).

The original version of this article read "which brings about the effect that is the finished" which is imprecise and hard to understand.

'''''The Question Concerning Technology''''' ({{lang-de|Die Frage nach der Technik}}) is a work by [[Martin Heidegger]], in which the author discusses the essence of technology. Heidegger originally published the text in 1954, in ''Vorträge und Aufsätze''.

Heidegger initially developed the themes in the text in the lecture "The Framework" (''"[[Gestell|Das Gestell]]"''), first presented on December 1, 1949, in [[Bremen]]. "The Framework" was presented as the second of four lectures, collectively called "Insight into what is." The other lectures were titled "The Thing" (''"Das Ding"''), "The Danger" (''"Die Gefahr"''), and "The Turning" (''"Die Kehre"'').&lt;ref&gt;Albert Borgmann, "Technology," ''A Companion to Heidegger'' Ed. Dreyfus and Wrathall (Blackwell Publishing, 2005), 428.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The question concerning technology,  is asked, as Heidegger notes, “so as to prepare a free relationship to it”.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As further noted, the relationship will be free “if it opens our human existence to the essence of technology”.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; This stems from the fact that “Only the true brings us into a free relationship with that which concerns us from out of its essence”.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, questioning uncovers the questioned in its (true) essence  as it is; enabling it to be “experienced within its own bounds”.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger's questioning builds a way by  seeking “the true by way of the correct”.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; This is akin to the Aristotelian way of advancing “from what is more obscure by nature, but clearer to us, towards what is more clear and more knowable by nature”&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle 1984, p. 184a21.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Heidegger begins the question by noting  that “We ask the question concerning technology when we ask what it is”.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This stems from following  an ancient doctrine to which “the essence of a thing is considered to be what the thing is”.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; He starts from the correct or clear definition  that “Everyone knows ; the two statements that answer our question”.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are “Technology is a means to an end [and] a human activity”.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason granted is that “to posit ends and procure and utilize the means to them is a human activity”.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; If technology is a  means to a human end, this conception can therefore be “called the instrumental and anthropological definition of technology”.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This further means that one has to ask “What is the instrumental itself?”.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This entails questioning the purview of instrumentality in which means and ends are subsumed. As noted “Within what do such things as means and end belong?”.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

A means can be seen as that through, and by which an end is effected. As pointed out, it is that “whereby something is effected and thus attained”.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, it can be seen as a cause, for “Whatever has an effect as its consequence is called a cause”.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; But an end is also a cause to the extent that it determines the kind of means to be used to actualize it. As noted, “The end in keeping with which the kind of means to be used is determined is also considered a cause”.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; This conceptualization of instrumentality as means and ends leads the question further into causality. As noted “Wherever ends are pursued and means are employed, wherever instrumentality reigns, there reigns causality”.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

To question causality, Heidegger starts from what “For centuries philosophy has taught”.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted, it  has  claimed that  “there are four causes”.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; These are traditionally enumerated as the  “ ''causa materialis,'' the material, the matter out of which" something is made.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''“causa formalis,'' the form, the shape into which the material enters”.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The “ ''causa finalis,'' the end,in relation to which [the thing]  required is determined as to its form and matter"&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; : and  the ''“causa efficiens,'' which brings about the effect that is the finished [thing]”.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; As concluded, “What technology is, when represented as a means, discloses itself when we trace instrumentality back to fourfold causality.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1977, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; To explain this, Heidegger uses the example of a silver chalice.&lt;ref name=hi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.hawaii.edu/criticalink/heidegger/guide1.html|title=Heidegger: The Question Concerning Technology|publisher=University of Hawaii|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each element works together to create the chalice in a different manner:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus four ways of owing hold sway in the sacrificial vessel that lies ready before us. They differ from one another, yet they belong together. ... The four ways of being responsible bring something into appearance. They let it come forth into presencing. They set it free to that place and so start it on its way, namely into its complete arrival.&lt;ref name=Heidegger&gt;Martin Heidegger, "The Question Concerning Technology," ''Basic Writings'' Ed. David Farrell Krell (Harper &amp; Row, 1977), 287.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When these four elements work together to create something into appearance, it is called ''bringing-forth''.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/540032/A_Field_Guide_to_Heidegger_Understanding_The_Question_concerning_Technology%20|title=A Field Guide to Heidegger Understanding ''The Question Concerning Technology''|author=David Waddington|journal=''Educational Philosophy and Theory''|date=2005|edition= Vol. 37, No. 4|page= 568|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidegger /&gt; This bringing-forth comes from the Greek ''[[poiesis]]'',&lt;ref name=hi /&gt; which "brings out of concealment into unconcealment".&lt;ref name=Heidegger /&gt; This revealing can be represented by the Greek word ''aletheia'', which in English is translated as truth.&lt;ref name=Heidegger /&gt; This truth has everything to do with the essence of technology because technology is a means of revealing the truth.&lt;ref name=hi /&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidegger /&gt;

Modern technology, however, differs from ''poiesis''.&lt;ref name=hi /&gt;&lt;ref name="academia.edu" /&gt; Heidegger suggests that this difference stems from the fact that modern technology "is based on modern physics as an exact science".&lt;ref name=Heidegger /&gt; The revealing of modern technology, therefore, is not bringing-forth, but rather ''challenging-forth''.&lt;ref name=hi /&gt;&lt;ref name="academia.edu" /&gt; To exemplify this, Heidegger draws on the Rhine River as an example of how our modern technology can change a cultural symbol.&lt;ref name=hi /&gt;

To further his discussion of modern technology, Heidegger introduces the notion of ''standing-reserve''. Modern technology places humans in standing-reserve.&lt;ref name=hi /&gt; To explain this, Heidegger uses the example of a forester and his relationship to the paper and print industries, as he waits in standing reserve for their wishes.&lt;ref name=hi /&gt;

Heidegger once again returns to discuss the essence of modern technology to name it ''Gestell'', which he defines primarily as a sort of enframing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Enframing means the gathering together of that setting-upon that sets upon man, i.e., challenges him forth, to reveal the real, in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve. Enframing means that way of revealing that holds sway in the essence of modern technology and that it is itself not technological.&lt;ref name=Heidegger /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Once he has discussed enframing, Heidegger highlights the threat of technology. As he states, this threat "does not come in the first instance from the potentially lethal machines and apparatus of technology".&lt;ref name=Heidegger /&gt; Rather, the threat is the essence because "the rule of enframing threatens man with the possibility that it could be denied to him to enter into a more original revealing and hence to experience the call of a more primal truth".&lt;ref name=Heidegger /&gt; This is because challenging-forth conceals the process of bringing-forth, which means that truth itself is concealed and no longer unrevealed.&lt;ref name=Heidegger /&gt; Unless humanity makes an effort to re-orient itself, it will not be able to find revealing and truth.

It is at this point that Heidegger has encountered a [[paradox]]: humanity must be able to navigate the dangerous orientation of enframing because it is in this dangerous orientation that we find the potential to be rescued.&lt;ref name=hi /&gt; To further elaborate on this, Heidegger returns to his discussion of essence. Ultimately, he concludes that "the essence of technology is in a lofty sense ambiguous" and that "such ambiguity points to the mystery of all revealing, i.e., of truth".&lt;ref name=Heidegger /&gt;

The question concerning technology, Heidegger concludes, is one "concerning the constellation in which revealing and concealing, in which the coming to presence of the truth comes to pass".&lt;ref name=Heidegger /&gt; In other words, it is finding truth. Heidegger presents art as a way to navigate this constellation, this paradox, because the artist, or the poet as Heidegger suggests, views the world as it is and as it reveals itself.&lt;ref name=hi /&gt;

'''Thomas Hopkinson''' (April 6, 1709 – November 5, 1751) was a lawyer, public official, and prominent figure in colonial [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

==Early life==
Thomas Hopkinson was born in [[London]], on April 6, 1709, the son of Mary Hopkinson, and Thomas Hopkinson, a London scrivener and a member of [[Middle Temple]]. He was educated there, attending [[Oxford University]] (but not graduating) and then studying law at London. He then immigrated about 1731 to [[Pennsylvania]], where he became a merchant, lawyer, judge, and natural philosopher, as well as a friend of [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref name="JW Jordan" /&gt;

==Career==
He worked with Franklin on several of his experiments on electricity and was a member of the [[Junto (club)|Junto]]. As a young [[barrister]], he was appointed deputy to [[Charles Read (Philadelphia)|Charles Read]], Clerk of the Orphans' Court of Philadelphia. Upon his death, he was commissioned as his successor on January 20, 1736-7, filling that position until November 5, 1751, when he died. On the same date, he was commissioned Master of Rolls for the city, serving until 1741.&lt;ref name="JW Jordan" /&gt;

Hopkinson held a number of legal and judicial positions, including Justice (1749), and Judge of the Vice Admiralty of the Province (1744-5). He was also a member of the Provincial (1747), and Common Councils (1741). As a merchant, Hopkinson acted as agent for several London firms, and in partnership with [[William Coleman (judge)|William Coleman]], imported and sold a wide variety of goods, including fabrics, spices, gunpowder and iron. Under [[James Hamilton (Pennsylvania)|James Hamilton]], he became Deputy Prothonotary, in 1748 becoming Prothonotary until his death.&lt;ref name="JW Jordan" /&gt;

Hopkinson was a founder of both the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]], as well as an original trustee of the College of Philadelphia (now the [[University of Pennsylvania]]), and served as first president of the [[American Philosophical Society]]. He was also an active [[Masonry|Mason]]. He married Mary Johnson in 1736, and together they had eight children. He enrolled his son [[Francis Hopkinson]], later a signatory of the [[American Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in the first classes at the Academy. One of his daughters married Reverend [[Jacob Duché]], and another [[John Morgan (physician)|Dr. John Morgan]]. Hopkinson was an early subscriber of the [[Dancing Assemblies of Philadelphia|Dancing Assembly]].&lt;ref name="JW Jordan" /&gt;

Franklin wrote about him: "The power of points to throw off electrical fire was first communicated to me by my ingenious friend, Thomas Hopkinson, since deceased, whose virtue and integrity in every station of life, public and private, will ever make his memory dear to those who knew him and knew how to value him".&lt;ref name="JW Jordan" /&gt;

==Family==
Thomas Hopkinson married at [[Christ Church, Philadelphia]] on September 9, 1735, to Mary Johnson (b. August 4, 1718, [[Appoquinimink Hundred]] - d. November 9, 1804, Philadelphia). Johnson's grandfather was [[Sergeant-at-arms]] to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], while her first cousin was [[James Johnson (bishop of Worcester)]].&lt;ref name="JW Jordan"&gt;John W.

{{Zen Buddhism}}
{{Western Buddhism}}
'''Zen master''' is a somewhat vague [[English language|English]] term that arose in the first half of the 20th century, sometimes used to refer to an individual who teaches [[Zen Buddhist]] [[meditation]] and practices, usually implying longtime study and subsequent authorization to teach and transmit the tradition themselves.

==China==
Until the Tang Dynasty, the term "Chánshī" (禅师; Dhyana Master) was regularly used for a monk who was a master of [[Ch'an Buddhism|chan]], or meditation, versus those who specialized in [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] (scriptural teachings) and [[Vinaya]] (discipline and moral precepts).&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/G002SECT9 The Chinese Buddhist Schools: Chan]&lt;/ref&gt; This included several important figures who were later not considered to be part of the "[[Chinese Chán|Chán]] school" per se, such as [[Tiantai]] Master [[Zhiyi]].

In contemporary China, the term "Chán" (禪), being simply one of many terms for forms of meditation, is not limited to the [[Chinese Chán|Chán]] school alone. Neither the majority of monastics nor lay people are formally tied to a given "school" of Buddhist practice, which is different from the situation in Japan. It is only those senior and experienced practitioners who receive such transmission into the [[Chinese Chán|Chán]] school. Most temples belong to the Chán school in name, but also embrace other teachings including those of [[Tiantai]], [[Pure Land]], [[Huayan school|Huayan]], and [[Yogācāra|Yogacara]] schools, often under the umbrella term "[[Chinese Buddhism]]" (中國佛教). This has been the norm for the past 1000 years, since the [[Song Dynasty]].

While there are no official organizations to regulate the use of honorary titles, "chánshī" is used as a title of respect for an adept, typically a monk, who specializes in Chán. "Chánzōng Dàshī" (禅宗大師; Great Master of the Chán School) is a similar and more specific honorary term, though rather rare. The same is true for the simple title "Dàshī" (大師; Great Master) which is rarely used to address a Dharma teacher (and any master of a specific craft or trade); the term is often bestowed posthumously by followers and students, although there are some exceptions (e.g. [[Hsing Yun]]).

The more common term when addressing a Buddhist master is "[[Sifu|Shīfu]]" (師父; Master), which is also used for any monk or nun as a matter of respect. Strictly speaking, this term, which includes the relational term for "father" (父), refers more to one's own teacher or preceptor.  The term "Făshī" (法師; Dharma teacher) is more generic, and is used both by lay Buddhists and also by Buddhists monastics themselves. The general term "Lǎoshī" (老師; Teacher) is also used to address a master as one's teacher, but this term is a general one, so much so that it is used for a teacher of any subject.

==Japan==

There is no standard official title for "Zen Master" across the various Zen traditions in Japan. Various titles may be used:
* "[[Zen ranks and hierarchy#Shike|Shike]]" is used for a select group of people, both in Rinzai and Soto, who are qualified to supervise the training of priests-to-be in the ''sodos'', the training halls.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|276}}{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=177}} 
* "[[Rōshi]]" ("old teacher") is traditionally an honorific title given to older monks and Zen teachers in Japan, though both "sensei" and "roshi" have come to denote official or semi-official ranks within some Zen schools in Japan, the United States and Europe.
* "[[Sensei]]" (simply "teacher") is often applied in addressing the Zen teacher or "master".
* "[[Oshō]]", "virtuous monk/priest" is used for trainees who have acquired a basic level of priesthood.&lt;ref name=Antaiji5 group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/adult50.shtml Muho Noelke, ''Part 5: Sessa-takuma - ango as life in a rock grinder'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sōtō===
In [[Sōtō]] Zen, the title "Dai-Osho" is the highest priestly rank in a clear [[Zen ranks and hierarchy|monastic hierarchy]]. It is only surpassed by "Zenji" which is only applied to [[Dōgen]] and [[Keizan]] (the founders of the school), and to the current or former abbots of the two head temples of the sect.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/201005.shtml Ten points to keep in mind about dharma transmission]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Seager|1999}} To supervise training monks, further qualifications are required:

{{quote|The relatively low status of dharma transmission means that in and of itself it does not qualify one to accept students or to train disciples. According to the regulations, Zen students should be supervised only by a teacher who has attained supervisory certification (i.e. ''sanzen dōjō shike'' status), that is, someone who in the popular literature might be called a Zen master. To attain supervisory certification requires not just high ecclesiastical grades and dharma seniority but also at least three years' experience as an assistant supervisor at a specially designated training hall (''tokubetsu sōdō''), during which time one undergoes an apprenticeship.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|276}}}}

===Rinzai===
In Rinzai too, further training is needed to be qualified as a supervisor. The common transmission does not include ''inka shōmei''. Ideally ''inka shōmei'' is "the formal recognition of Zen's deepest realisation",{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=54}} but practically it is being used for the transmission of the "true lineage" of the masters (''shike'') of the training halls.{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=13}} Training halls are temples which are authorised for further training after being qualified as a temple priest.

According to roshi Sokun Tsushimoto, the title of ''roshi'' is equivalent to ''Zen master'' and ''shike'':&lt;ref name="BD" /&gt;
{{quote|'Roshi' is the title compatible with the most formal title ‘Shike’ who got officially authorized as a Dharma successor by authentic master.&lt;ref name="BD"&gt;[http://boeddhistischdagblad.nl/rients-ritskes-op-beschuldiging-raksu-formeel-uitgereikt-als-bewijs-van-een-competent-zenleader/ Boeddhistisch Dagblad, 17 April 2013, ''Rients Ritskes op beschuldiging: ‘Raksu formeel uitgereikt als bewijs van competent zenleiderschap’'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more information on Sokun Tsushimoto, see [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20090802x1.html The Japan Times online: Caring for body and soul. Interview with Sokun Tsushimoto]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are only about fifty&lt;ref name=Antaiji10 group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/adult50.shtml Muho Noelke, ''Part 10: What does it take to become a full-fledged Sōtō-shu priest and is it really worth the whole deal?'']&lt;/ref&gt; to eighty&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://archive.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2002/winter/dictionary-roshi_winter02.htm Buddhadharma Dictionary: Roshi]&lt;/ref&gt; of such ''inka shōmei''-bearers in Japan:
{{quote|In Rinzai Zen, it is relatively easy to say who is a roshi and who is not. Anyone who is authorized by another roshi (i.e. his teacher) is a roshi. This authorization (officially the "inka-shômei" document) is documented on a piece of paper, that is why it is also called colloquially "ichi-mai", that is "one sheet (of paper)". The transmission is totally vertical from teacher to student, no peer control is involved. That means that the Rinzai sect has no means to control who is made a roshi and who is not. In spite of that, the number of Rinzai roshis is relatively low, maybe around 50 or so.&lt;ref name=Antaiji10 group=web /&gt;}}

According to roshi Sokun Tsushimoto,
{{quote|Authorization as a Roshi should be done in the most formal and explicit way. In Rinzai tradition a master gives a calligraphy of Inka-certificate to disciple as a proof of authorization. Needless to say authorization must be backed up by the fact that the disciple spent many years in zen training under the master earnestly and continuously.&lt;ref name="BD" /&gt;}}

The ''shike'' is not married. The shike...
{{quote|[H]as the prestige and generally owns the respect of being a true Zen master, a living symbol of the Zen monastic tradition, the quintessence of Zen virtues ideally incarnating wisdom, spirituality, strict discipline, individuality, and yet gentle social personality.{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=60}}}}

The shike is also the head of the sect (subschool of the Rinzai-school, with its own head temple). They appoint and dismiss the priests, and appoint the titles in the ranking system.{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=60-61}} Yet, "the position as abbot [at Myōshinji] is based on election, each elected period lasting four years".{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=61}}

===Women===
[[Mugai Nyodai]] (1223 – 1298 CE), of Japan, was the first female Zen master in the world.&lt;ref name="bellaonline1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art46823.asp |title=Mugai Nyodai, First Woman to Head a Zen Order – Buddhism |publisher=Bellaonline.com |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/22/nyregion/japanese-zen-master-honored-by-her-followers.html |title=Japanese Zen Master Honored by Her Followers – New York Times |work=The New York Times  |date=22 November 1998 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i0ni1NmbYe0C&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=%22mugai+nyodai+was+born%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7nOhz8EgR8&amp;sig=TiwB2MIJ1a2ac0o1MrQr6spaI0c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4PKRTdf7IcWO0QHg-uTMBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Handbook to life in medieval and ... – William E. Deal – Google Books |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korea==
Sunim is the [[Korean language|Korean]] title for a [[Buddhist monk]] or [[Buddhist nun]] of any tradition, and does not denote any specific rank or qualification. It is considered respectful to refer to senior monks or nuns in [[Korea]] as ''Kun sunim'', and this polite way of expressing the title can also denote some sort of realization on the part of the individual being addressed. In most Korean temples, a middle-aged monk assumes the role of a ''juji sunim'', who serves administrative functions. The eldest sunim is typically seen as a symbolic leader of the younger sunims.

In Korean Soen, Inka (In'ga) typically refers to the private acknowledgement of dharma transmission from a teacher to their student. "Transmission" is used to refer to the public ceremonial version of the same acknowledgement. Both are considered equal in authority and "realization". A monk with either In'ga or the public "transmission" is qualified to hold the post of Soen Sa, or "Zen Master" for a temple, and give transmission to their own students (either, In'ga or public "transmission"). The majority of Zen Masters in Korea have only received, and only give In'ga, with the formal transmission ceremony being far more rare.{{sfn|Buswell|1992}}

In the [[Kwan Um School of Zen]], founded by Korean Zen teacher [[Seung Sahn]] in America and Europe, a Zen master can be referred to as a ''Soen Sa Nim'' ("Soen" or "Son" being Korean for Chan, or Zen). Seung Sahn himself is usually referred to as "Dae Soen Sa Nim" (the honorific "Dae" means "great").&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.kwanumzen.org/teachers-and-teaching/glossary-of-terms/ Glossary of Terms]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Daehang Sunim|2007|p=96-97}}{{sfn|Kwan|2003|p=125}}

Kwan Um School of Zen is unique in the fact that it clearly distinguishes two "levels" of Zen teachers. "Lower" level is referred to as ''Ji Do Poep Sa Nim'', or [[Dharma]] master. Ji Do Poep Sa Nim is a person who has received only Inka (which in Kwan Um School of Zen is given during public ceremony as well). He/she is allowed to teach, but only within the school - if a Dharma master decides to leave the school, his/her title and teaching authority is considered void. A Ji Do Poep Sa Nim also cannot give Inka to other individuals.

When a Ji Do Poep Sa Nim has his or her realization "confirmed" by several (typically three) Zen masters from '''outside''' the school, he/she becomes eligible for "full" transmission and the title of Zen master (Soen Sa Nim), which is given during another public ceremony. A Soen Sa Nim can give both Inka and transmission to other individuals and keeps his/her title and teaching authority if he/she decides to leave the school.

==Western culture==
"Zen master" has been used to refer to individuals hailing from any number of countries and traditions. It is not an exact translation of any title from the countries from which Zen traditions emanate, where titles vary widely, even in different traditions from the same country. Its usage has diminished among contemporary American Zen teachers and practitioners.

The term has entered popular culture and has been used to refer to any number of public figures in sports and entertainment, denoting a person who demonstrates detachment and control in stressful situations. It was sometimes adopted by figures in the spiritual counterculture of the 1970s and 1980s who had little or no actual Zen training ("[[Frederick Lenz|Zen Master Rama]]," "[[Rajneesh|Osho]]",) presumably to generate positive associations or legitimacy.
