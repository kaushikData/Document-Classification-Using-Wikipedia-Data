      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="859">In the [[sociology of religion]], [[Luc de Heusch]] coined the term '''adorcism''' for practices to placate or accommodate [[spiritual entities]] in a [[Spirit_possession|possessed]] person or place. Unlike [[exorcism]], the relationship with the entities is potentially positive. This is sometimes used as [[initiation]] into a spirit cult.&lt;ref&gt;Luc de Heusch. Cultes de possession et religions initiatiques de salut en Afrique. Annales du Centre d'etudes des Religions, ii. 226-44. 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-Michel Oughourlian defines adorcism as "voluntary, desired, and curative possessions".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Oughourlian. The Puppet of Desire: The Psychology of Hysteria, Possession, and Hypnosis [Eugene Webb, trans. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1991], p. 97).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Airline timetables''' are printed pamphlets or folders that many [[airlines]] have traditionally used to inform passengers of several different things, such as schedules, fleet, security, in-flight entertainment, food menus, baggage weight restrictions, and contact information.

Airline timetables used to be printed, multi-page pamphlets available at airport counters, or upon request by phone or mail. On January 16, 1928, [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] published one of their first timetables. It read ''The air-way to [[Havana]], Pan American Airways, [[Pershing Square Building]], New York''. 
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:CI timetable win07.jpg|left|230px|thumb|Timetable of [[China Airlines]] with their official spokesperson, the supermodel, [[Lin Chi-ling]] and flight attendants in new uniform on the cover {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;

Many airline timetables had colorful covers. The timetables of very small airlines, such as [[Scenic Airways]], consisted of one sheet of paper, with their hub's flight time information on the front, and the return times on the back. 
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:CX onlinetimetable.jpg|right|230px|thumb|Online timetable of [[Cathay Pacific]] Airways.Data shown on the picture are flights from [[Hong Kong International Airport]] to its secondary hub, [[Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport]] of [[Taipei]]{{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;

In recent years, most airlines have stopped production of printed timetables, in order to cut costs and reduce the delay between a change of schedule and a new timetable being in the hands of the public. As a consequence, most airlines now post their timetables only [[Internet|online]] (the larger airlines often offering a stand-alone application, while others provide just a downloadable document such as a [[PDF]]), and the value of many printed airline timetable has risen among collectors.

{{Anthropology}}

'''Anthropology''' is the study of [[human]]s and [[human behavior]] and [[society|societies]] in the past and present.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite web | title=anthropology | url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/anthropology?q=anthropology |work=Oxford Dictionaries | publisher=Oxford University Press | accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/27505/anthropology | title=anthropology | work=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica | accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa&gt;{{cite web | title=What is Anthropology? | url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/whatisanthropology.cfm | publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]] | accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social anthropology]] and [[cultural anthropology]]&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt; study the norms and values of societies. [[Linguistic anthropology]] studies how language affects social life. [[Biological anthropology|Biological or physical anthropology]]&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt; studies the biological development of humans.

[[Archaeology]], which studies past human cultures through investigation of physical evidence, is thought of as a branch of anthropology in the United States and Canada, while in Europe, it is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines, such as history.

==Origin and development of the term==
[[File:Sahagun.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Bernardino de Sahag√∫n]] is considered to be the founder of modern anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;https://muse.jhu.edu/article/43462&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|History of anthropology}}
The abstract noun ''[[wikt:anthropology|anthropology]]'' is first attested in reference to [[history]].&lt;ref name=oed2/&gt;{{refn|group=n|[[Richard Harvey (astrologer)|Richard Harvey]]'s 1593 ''Philadelphus'', a defense of the legend of [[Brutus of Britain|Brutus]] in [[History of Britain|British history]], includes the passage "Genealogy or issue which they had, Artes which they studied, Actes which they did. This part of History is named Anthropology."}} Its present use first appeared in [[German Renaissance|Renaissance]] [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] in the works of [[Magnus Hundt]] and [[Otto Casmann]].&lt;ref name="Medicine"&gt;{{cite book|author=Israel Institute of the History of Medicine|title=Koroth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lev_H1Ie0zcC&amp;pg=PA19|publisher=BRILL|page=19|id=GGKEY:34XGYHLZ7XY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[New Latin]] ''{{lang|la|anthropologia}}'' derived from the [[combining form]]s of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''√°nthr≈çpos'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|·ºÑŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÇ}}}}, "[[human]]") and ''l√≥gos'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ}}}}, "[[science|study]]").&lt;ref name=oed2&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st&amp;nbsp;ed. "anthropology, ''n.''" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1885.&lt;/ref&gt; (Its adjectival form appeared in the works of [[Aristotle]].)&lt;ref name=oed2/&gt; It began to be used in English, possibly via [[French language|French]] ''{{lang|fr|Anthropologie}}'', by the early 18th century.&lt;ref name=oed2/&gt;{{refn|group=n|[[John Kersey]]'s 1706 edition of ''[[The New World of English Words]]'' includes the definition "''Anthropology'', a Discourse or Description of Man, or of a Man's Body."}}

===Through the 19th century===
In 1647, the Bartholins, founders of the [[University of Copenhagen]], defined ''{{lang|fr|l'anthropologie}}'' as follows:&lt;ref name=frenchy&gt;{{cite book | last1=Bartholin | first1=Caspar | last2=Bartholin | first2=Thomas | author-link1=Caspar Bartholin the Younger | author-link2=Thomas Bartholin | others=Translated from the Latin by Abr. Du Prat | year=1647 | title=Institutions anatomiques de Gaspar Bartholin, augment√©es et enrichies pour la seconde fois tant des opinions et observations nouvelles des modernes | location=Paris | publisher=M. H√©nault et J. H√©nault | chapter=Preface }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Anthropology, that is to say the science that treats of man, is divided ordinarily and with reason into Anatomy, which considers the body and the parts, and Psychology, which speaks of the soul.{{refn|group=n|In French: ''L'Anthropologie, c'est √† dire la science qui traite de l'homme, est divis√©e ordinairment &amp; avec raison en l'Anatomie, qui considere le corps &amp; les parties, et en la Psychologie, qui parle de l'Ame''.&lt;ref name=frenchy/&gt;}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently, such as the use by [[√âtienne Serres]] in 1839 to describe the natural history, or paleontology, of man, based on comparative anatomy, and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)]] by [[Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Br√©au]]. Various short-lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed. The [[Soci√©t√© Ethnologique de Paris]], the first to use [[Ethnology]], was formed in 1839. Its members were primarily anti-slavery activists. When slavery was abolished in France in 1848 the Soci√©t√© was abandoned.

Meanwhile, the Ethnological Society of New York, currently the [[American Ethnological Society]], was founded on its model in 1842, as well as the [[Ethnological Society of London]] in 1843, a break-away group of the [[Aborigines' Protection Society]].&lt;ref name=Schiller131&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|pp=130‚Äì132}}&lt;/ref&gt; These anthropologists of the times were liberal, anti-slavery, and pro-[[Human rights|human-rights activists.]] They maintained international connections.

Anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century. Theorists in such diverse fields as [[comparative anatomy|anatomy]], [[Comparative method (linguistics)|linguistics]], and [[Ethnology]], making feature-by-feature comparisons of their subject matters, were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals, languages, and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; For them, the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect. Darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in [[agronomy]] and in the wild.

Darwin and Wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s. There was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences. [[Paul Broca]] in Paris was in the process of breaking away from the [[Soci√©t√© de biologie]] to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies, the [[Society of Anthropology of Paris|Soci√©t√© d'Anthropologie de Paris]], meeting for the first time in Paris in 1859.&lt;ref name=Fletcher&gt;{{cite book | first=Robert | last=Fletcher | chapter=Paul Broca and the French School of Anthropology | title=The Saturday Lectures, Delivered in the Lecture-room of the U. S. National Museum under the Auspices of the Anthropological and Biological Societies of Washington in March and April 1882 | year=1882 | location=Boston; Washington, D.C. | publisher=D. Lothrop &amp; Co.; Judd &amp; Detweiler | url={{Google books|9dEJAQAAIAAJ|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|As [[Robert Fletcher (anthropologist)|Fletcher]] points out, the French society was by no means the first to include anthropology or parts of it as its topic. Previous organizations used other names. The German Anthropological Association of St. Petersburg, however, in fact met first in 1861, but due to the death of its founder never met again.&lt;ref name=Fletcher/&gt;}} When he read Darwin, he became an immediate convert to ''Transformisme'', as the French called [[evolutionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; His definition now became "the study of the human group, considered as a whole, in its details, and in relation to the rest of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broca, being what today would be called a [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]], had taken an interest in the pathology of speech. He wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals, which appeared to reside in speech. He discovered the speech center of the human brain, today called [[Broca's area]] after him. His interest was mainly in [[Biological anthropology]], but a German philosopher specializing in psychology, [[Theodor Waitz]], took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six-volume work, entitled ''Die Anthropologie der Naturv√∂lker'', 1859‚Äì1864. The title was soon translated as "The Anthropology of Primitive Peoples". The last two volumes were published posthumously.

Waitz defined anthropology as "the science of the nature of man". By nature he meant matter animated by "the Divine breath";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., he was an [[Animism|animist]]. Following Broca's lead, Waitz points out that anthropology is a new field, which would gather material from other fields, but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy, physiology, and psychology to differentiate man from "the animals nearest to him". He stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical, gathered by experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of civilization, as well as ethnology, are to be brought into the comparison. It is to be presumed fundamentally that the species, man, is a unity, and that "the same laws of thought are applicable to all men".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|pp=11‚Äì12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waitz was influential among the British ethnologists. In 1863 the explorer [[Richard Francis Burton]] and the speech therapist [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]] broke away from the [[Ethnological Society of London]] to form the [[Anthropological Society of London]], which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology. It was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence. Representatives from the French ''Soci√©t√©'' were present, though not Broca. In his keynote address, printed in the first volume of its new publication, ''The Anthropological Review'', Hunt stressed the work of Waitz, adopting his definitions as a standard.&lt;ref name=hunt&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|1863|loc=Introductory Address}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Hunt's choice of theorists does not exclude the numerous other theorists that were beginning to publish a large volume of anthropological studies.&lt;ref name=hunt/&gt;}} Among the first associates were the young [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], inventor of [[cultural anthropology]], and his brother [[Alfred Tylor]], a geologist. Previously Edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist; subsequently, an anthropologist.

Similar organizations in other countries followed: The Anthropological Society of Madrid (1865), the [[American Anthropological Association]] in 1902, the Anthropological Society of Vienna (1870), the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently. The majority of these were evolutionist. One notable exception was the [[Berliner Gesellschaft f√ºr Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte|Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology, and Prehistory]] (1869) founded by [[Rudolph Virchow]], known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists. Not religious himself, he insisted that Darwin's conclusions lacked empirical foundation.

During the last three decades of the 19th century, a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred, most independent, most publishing their own journals, and all international in membership and association. The major theorists belonged to these organizations. They supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning. By 1898 the American Association for the Advancement of Science was able to report that 48 educational institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology. None of the 75 faculty members were under a department named anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |  title=Extent of Instruction in Anthropology in Europe and the United States | first=George Grant | last=Maccurdy | journal=Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science | year=1899 | pages=382‚Äì390 | url={{Google books|PA385&amp;dq|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th and 21st centuries===
This meager statistic expanded in the 20th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the world's higher educational institutions, many thousands in number. Anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more. Practical Anthropology, the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems, has arrived; for example, the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene. The organization has reached global level. For example, the World Council of Anthropological Associations (WCAA), "a network of national, regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology", currently contains members from about three dozen nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Home | publisher=World Council of Anthropological Associations | accessdate=29 March 2015 | url= http://www.wcaanet.org/index.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the work of [[Franz Boas]] and [[Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, ''social'' anthropology in Great Britain and [[cultural anthropology|''cultural'' anthropology]] in the US have been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on [[cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparisons]], long-term in-depth examination of context, and the importance it places on [[Participant observation|participant-observation]] or experiential immersion in the area of research. Cultural anthropology, in particular, has emphasized [[cultural relativism]], [[holism]], and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques.&lt;ref name="Hylland Eriksen 2004 p. 79"&gt;Hylland Eriksen, Thomas. (2004) "What is Anthropology" Pluto. London. p. 79. {{ISBN|0745323200}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from [[Boasian anthropology|Boas' arguments]] against 19th-century racial [[ideology]], through [[Margaret Mead]]'s advocacy for [[gender equality]] and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of [[post-colonialism|post-colonial]] oppression and promotion of [[multiculturalism]]. [[Ethnography]] is one of its primary [[research design]]s as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994p331"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiro1987"&gt;On varieties of cultural relativism in anthropology, see Spiro, Melford E.

In Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries, the British tradition of [[social anthropology]] tends to dominate. In the United States, anthropology has traditionally been divided into the [[four field approach]] developed by [[Franz Boas]] in the early 20th century: [[Biological anthropology|''biological'' or ''physical'' anthropology]]; [[social anthropology|''social'']], [[cultural anthropology|''cultural'']], or [[sociocultural anthropology|''sociocultural'' anthropology]]; and [[archaeology]]; plus [[linguistic anthropology|anthropological linguistics]]. These fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques.

European countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more [[ethnology]] (a term coined and defined by [[Adam Franti≈°ek Koll√°r|Adam F. Koll√°r]] in 1783). It is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the European tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Robert (1998) ''An Introduction to Theory in Anthropology''.

{{further|American anthropology}}

Anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. Anthropology builds upon knowledge from [[natural science]]s, including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'', human physical traits, [[human behavior]], the variations among different groups of humans, how the evolutionary past of ''Homo sapiens'' has influenced its social organization and culture, and from [[social science]]s, including the organization of human social and cultural relations, institutions, social conflicts, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/about/WhatisAnthropology.cfm What is Anthropology ‚Äì American Anthropological Association].

According to [[Clifford Geertz]],
{{quotation|"anthropology is perhaps the last of the great nineteenth-century conglomerate disciplines still for the most part organizationally intact. Long after natural history, moral philosophy, philology, and political economy have dissolved into their specialized successors, it has remained a diffuse assemblage of ethnology, human biology, comparative linguistics, and prehistory, held together mainly by the vested interests, sunk costs, and administrative habits of academia, and by a romantic image of comprehensive scholarship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham and London|pages=Back Cover|editor1=Daniel A. Segal |editor2=Sylvia J. Yanagisako |isbn=0822386844}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Sociocultural anthropology]] has been heavily influenced by [[structuralism|structuralist]] and postmodern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies. During the 1970s and 1990s, there was an [[epistemological]] shift away from the [[positivist]] traditions that had largely informed the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Behar, Clifford &amp; James&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2012}} During this shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology. In contrast, archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist. Due to this difference in epistemology, the four sub-fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades.

===Sociocultural===
{{main|Cultural anthropology|Social anthropology|Sociocultural anthropology}}
Sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of [[cultural anthropology]] and [[social anthropology]]. Cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people ''make sense'' of the world around them, while social anthropology is the study of the ''relationships'' among individuals and groups.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994pxv"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=GENERAL INTRODUCTION | encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology | author=Ingold, Tim |authorlink=Tim Ingold| year=1994 | pages=xv |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0415021375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural anthropology is more related to [[philosophy]], literature and [[the arts]] (how one's culture affects the experience for self and group, contributing to a more complete understanding of the people's knowledge, customs, and institutions), while social anthropology is more related to [[sociology]] and history.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994pxv"/&gt; In that, it helps develop an understanding of social structures, typically of others and other populations (such as minorities, subgroups, dissidents, etc.). There is no hard-and-fast distinction between them, and these categories overlap to a considerable degree.

Inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by [[cultural relativism]], the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994p331"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Introduction to culture | encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology | author=Ingold, Tim |authorlink=Tim Ingold | year=1994 | page=331 |isbn=0415021375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross-cultural comparison.&lt;ref name="Ingold1996p18"&gt;{{cite book | title=Key Debates In Anthropology | author=[[Tim Ingold]] | year=1996|  page=18|quote=the traditional anthropological project of cross-cultural or cross-societal comparison}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project is often accommodated in the field of [[ethnography]]. Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research, i.e. an ethnographic [[monograph]]. As a methodology, ethnography is based upon long-term fieldwork within a community or other research site. [[Participant observation]] is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernard |first=H. Russell |year=2002 |url=http://www.antropocaos.com.ar/Russel-Research-Method-in-Anthropology.pdf |title=Research Methods in Anthropology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104002847/http://www.antropocaos.com.ar/Russel-Research-Method-in-Anthropology.pdf |archive-date=4 November 2016 |publisher=[[Altamira Press]] |page=322 |isbn=0759108684 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethnology]] involves the systematic comparison of different cultures. The process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an [[emic]] (conceptual, vs. [[etic]], or technical) point of view.

The study of [[kinship]] and [[social organization]] is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology, as kinship is a [[human universal]]. Sociocultural anthropology also covers [[Economic anthropology|economic]] and [[Political anthropology|political organization]], law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and exchange, material culture, technology, infrastructure, gender relations, ethnicity, childrearing and socialization, religion, myth, symbols, values, etiquette, worldview, sports, music, nutrition, recreation, games, food, festivals, and language (which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology).

===Biological===
{{main|Biological anthropology}}
[[File:Human remains.jpg|thumb|left|Forensic anthropologists can help identify skeletonized human remains, such as these found lying in scrub in Western Australia, c. 1900‚Äì1910.]]

Biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non-human primates in their biological, evolutionary, and demographic dimensions. It examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates, and that generate, maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[University of Toronto]] |title=Research Subfields: Physical or Biological |access-date=14 March 2012 |url=http://anthropology.utoronto.ca/about/research/physical-or-biological |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422203737/http://www.anthropology.utoronto.ca/about/research/physical-or-biological |archive-date=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Archaeological===
{{main|Archaeology}}

[[Archaeology]] is the study of the human past through its material remains. Artifacts, faunal remains, and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies. Archaeologists examine this material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices. Ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remain of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups, who are presumed to have lived in similar ways.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, R. H. &amp; Larkin, S. N. (2007). Cultural Anthropology: A problem based approach. Toronto, ON: Nelson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rosetta Stone.svg|thumb|The Rosetta Stone was an example of ancient communication.]]

===Linguistic===
{{main|Linguistic anthropology}}
[[Linguistic anthropology]] (not to be confused with [[anthropological linguistics]]) seeks to understand the processes of human communications, verbal and non-verbal, variation in [[language]] across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americananthro.org/AdvanceYourCareer/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2150|title=What is Anthropology? - Advance Your Career|website=www.americananthro.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes. Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including [[sociolinguistics]], [[pragmatics]], [[cognitive linguistics]], [[semiotics]], [[discourse analysis]], and [[narrative]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Salzmann, Zdenƒõk. (1993) ''Language, culture, and society: an introduction to linguistic anthropology''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key topics by field: sociocultural ==

===Art, media, music, dance and film===
{{Anthropology of art}}

==== Art ====
{{main|Anthropology of art}}

One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of 'art' as a cultural phenomenon. Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting', 'sculpture', or 'literature', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Robert. (1981) ''The Anthropology of Art''.&lt;/ref&gt; To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities. Boas' ''Primitive Art'', Claude L√©vi-Strauss' ''The Way of the Masks'' (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally specific 'aesthetics'.

==== Media ====
{{main|Media anthropology}}
[[File:Punu mask Gabon.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A Punu tribe mask, Gabon, Central Africa]]
Media anthropology (also known as the anthropology of media or mass media) emphasizes [[ethnography|ethnographic studies]] as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of mass media. The types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, journalists in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media. Other types include [[cyber anthropology]], a relatively new area of [[internet research]], as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, [[social movement]]s, or health education. This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as radio, [[newspaper|the press]], [[new media]], and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Spitulnik, Deborah |title=Anthropology and Mass Media|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=22|page=293|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.22.100193.001453|url=http://www.philbu.net/media-anthropology/Spitulnik_MediaAnthro.pdf|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Abu-Lughod, Lila |year=1997|title=The Interpretation of Cultures after Television|journal=Representations|volume= 59|pages= 109‚Äì133|url=https://direitosehumanos.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/a-interpretac3a7c3a3o-das-culturas-depois-da-televisc3a3o.pdf|jstor=2928817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Music ====
{{main|Ethnomusicology}}
Ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music (broadly defined), that emphasize its cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.

==== Visual ====
{{main|Visual anthropology}}
Visual anthropology is concerned, in part, with the study and production of [[ethnography|ethnographic]] photography, film and, since the mid-1990s, [[new media]]. While the term is sometimes used interchangeably with [[ethnographic film]], visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation, including areas such as performance, museums, art, and the production and [[reception theory|reception]] of [[anthropology of media|mass media]]. Visual representations from all cultures, such as sandpaintings, tattoos, sculptures and reliefs, cave paintings, scrimshaw, jewelry, hieroglyphics, paintings, and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology.

=== Economic, political economic, applied and development ===
{{Economic anthropology}}

==== Economic ====
{{main|Economic anthropology}}
Economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope. It has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical. Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the Polish-British founder of anthropology, [[Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski]], and his French compatriot, [[Marcel Mauss]], on the nature of gift-giving exchange (or [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]]) as an alternative to market exchange. Economic Anthropology remains, for the most part, focused upon exchange. The school of thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy focuses on production, in contrast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hann|first=Chris|title=Economic Anthropology|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=55‚Äì71|author2=Hart, Keith |isbn=9780745644820}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists, and have now turned to examine corporations, banks, and the [[global financial system]] from an anthropological perspective.

====Political economy====
{{main|Political economy in anthropology}}
Political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of [[Historical Materialism]] to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. Political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the "pre-capitalist" societies that were subject to evolutionary "tribal" stereotypes. Sahlin's work on hunter-gatherers as the "original affluent society" did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist [[world-system]].&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161‚Äì85"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|pages=161‚Äì85|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.17.100188.001113}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.

==== Applied ====
{{main|Applied anthropology}}
Applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems. It is a "complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kedia, Satish|first=and Willigen J. Van|title=Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application|isbn=0275978419|year=2005|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn|pages=16, 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community. It is closely related to [[development anthropology]] (distinct from the more critical [[anthropology of development]]).

====Development====
{{main|anthropology of development}}
Anthropology of development tends to view development from a ''critical'' perspective. The kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? In short, why does so much planned development fail?

===Kinship, feminism, gender and sexuality===
{{Anthropology of kinship}}

==== Kinship ====
{{main|Kinship}}
''Kinship'' can refer both to ''the study of'' the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures, or it can refer to ''the patterns of social relationships'' themselves. Over its history, anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms, such as "[[kinship|descent]]", "[[descent group]]s", "[[lineage (anthropology)|lineages]]", "[[affinity (law)|affines]]", "[[cognatic kinship|cognates]]", and even "[[fictive kinship]]". Broadly, kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent (one's social relations during development), and also relatives by marriage.

==== Feminist ====
{{main|Feminist anthropology}}
Feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology ([[archaeology|archeological]], [[biological anthropology|biological]], [[cultural anthropology|cultural]], [[linguistic anthropology|linguistic]]) that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge. Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists. Historically, such 'peripheral' perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the [[western world]]. Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream [[feminist theory]]. Feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction of gender across societies. Feminist anthropology is inclusive of birth anthropology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/2940.html]&lt;/ref&gt; as a specialization. 

The first [[African-American]] female [[anthropologist]] and [[Caribbeanist]] is said to be [[Vera Mae Green]] who studied ethnic and family relations in the [[Caribbean]] as well as the United States, and thereby tried to improve the way black life, experiences, and culture were studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1525/aa.1982.84.3.02a00080|title = Vera Mae Green, 1928-1982| journal=American Anthropologist| volume=84| issue=3| pages=633‚Äì635|date = September 1982|last1 = Cole|first1 = Johnnetta B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical, nutritional, psychological, cognitive and transpersonal===
{{Medical anthropology}}

==== Medical ====
{{main|Medical anthropology}}

Medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies "human health and disease, health care systems, and biocultural adaptation".&lt;ref name=McElroy1996&gt;{{Cite book |year=1996 |author=McElroy, A |chapter=Medical Anthropology |editor1=D.

* the development of systems of medical knowledge and medical care
* the patient-physician relationship
* the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments
* the interaction of social, environmental and biological factors which influence health and illness both in the individual and the community as a whole
* the critical analysis of interaction between psychiatric services and migrant populations ("critical ethnopsychiatry": Beneduce 2004, 2007)
* the impact of biomedicine and biomedical technologies in non-Western settings
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering (Farmer, 1999, 2003; Beneduce, 2010) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness. On the other hand, there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production, such as ''cultural psychiatry'' and ''transcultural psychiatry'' or ''ethnopsychiatry''.

==== Nutritional ====
{{main|Nutritional anthropology}}

Nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between [[economic systems]], [[nutrition|nutritional status]] and [[food security]], and how changes in the former affect the latter. If economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food, food security, and dietary health, then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization. Nutritional status affects overall health status, work performance potential, and the overall potential for economic development (either in terms of human development or traditional western models) for any given group of people.

==== Psychological ====
{{main|Psychological anthropology}}
Psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of [[cultural anthropology|cultural]] and [[psychology|mental processes]]. This subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans' development and [[enculturation]] within a particular cultural group‚Äîwith its own history, language, practices, and conceptual categories‚Äîshape processes of human [[cognition]], [[emotion]], [[perception]], [[motivation]], and [[mental health]]. It also examines how the understanding of cognition, emotion, motivation, and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes.&lt;ref name="D'Andrade"&gt;{{cite book | last=D'Andrade | first=R. | chapter=The Sad Story of Anthropology: 1950‚Äì1999 | editor-first=E.

M. White |display-editors=etal | date = 1992 | title = New Directions in Psychological Anthropology | location = Cambridge, UK | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cognitive ====
{{main|Cognitive anthropology}}
Cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge, cultural [[innovation]], and transmission over time and space using the methods and [[theories]] of the [[cognitive sciences]] (especially [[experimental psychology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]) often through close collaboration with historians, ethnographers, archaeologists, linguists, musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of cultural forms. Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them.&lt;ref name="D'Andrade"/&gt;

==== Transpersonal ====
{{main|Transpersonal anthropology}}
Transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between [[altered states of consciousness]] and culture. As with [[transpersonal psychology]], the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (ASC) and [[transpersonal experience]]. However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues‚Äîfor instance, the roles of [[Mythology|myth]], [[ritual]], [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and [[Literature|texts]] in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Young | first1=David E. | first2=J.G. | last2=Goulet | date=1994 | title=Being Changed by Cross-cultural Encounters: The Anthropology of Extraordinary Experiences | publisher=Peterborough: Broadview Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and legal===
{{Political anthropology}}

==== Political ====
{{main|Political anthropology}}
Political anthropology concerns the structure of [[Form of government|political systems]], looked at from the basis of the structure of societies. Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more "complex" social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena. The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels. Firstly, anthropologists continued to study [[political organization]] and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization). Secondly, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions). An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today. Geertz' comparative work on "Negara", the Balinese state, is an early, famous example.

====Legal====
{{main|Legal anthropology}}
Legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in "the cross-cultural study of social ordering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Greenhouse, Carol J. | title = Praying for Justice: Faith, Order, and Community in an American Town |isbn=0801419719| location = Ithaca | publisher = Cornell UP | year = 1986 | page = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation. More recent applications include issues such as [[human rights]], [[legal pluralism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Political theologies: public religions in a post-secular world|year=2006|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York|editor1=Hent de Vries |editor2=Lawrence E. Sullivan }}&lt;/ref&gt; and political uprisings.

====Public====
{{main|Public anthropology}}
Public anthropology was created by Robert Borofsky, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University, to "demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline ‚Äì illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad, public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicanthropology.org Borofsky 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nature, science and technology ===
{{Cyber anthropology}}

====Cyborg====
{{main|Cyborg anthropology}}
Cyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the [[American Anthropological Association]]'s annual meeting in 1993. The sub-group was very closely related to [[science and technology studies|STS]] and the [[Society for the Social Studies of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;Dumit, Joseph. Davis-Floyd, Robbie (2001). "Cyborg Anthropology". in ''Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0415920922}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donna Haraway]]'s 1985 ''[[Cyborg Manifesto]]'' could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term. Cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built, specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings.

==== Digital ====
{{main|Digital anthropology}}
Digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital-era technology, and extends to various areas where anthropology and [[technology]] intersect. It is sometimes grouped with [[cultural anthropology|sociocultural anthropology]], and sometimes considered part of [[material culture]].  The field is new, and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases. These include techno-anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.studyguide.aau.dk/programmes/postgraduate/53203/ | title=Techno-Anthropology course guide | publisher=Aalborg University | accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; digital ethnography, cyberanthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://xirdalium.net/category/anthropology/cyberanthropology/ | title=Cyberanthropology | publisher=Peter Hammer Verlag Gmbh | date=August 2011 | accessdate=14 March 2013 | author=Knorr, Alexander | isbn=978-3-7795-0359-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and virtual anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Virtual Anthropology: A guide to a new interdisciplinary field | publisher=Springer |author1=Weber, Gerhard |author2=Bookstein, Fred | year=2011 | isbn=978-3-211-48647-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ecological ====
{{main|Ecological anthropology}}
Ecological anthropology is defined as the "study of [[cultural adaptation]]s to environments".&lt;ref name="Kottak"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kottak|first=Conrad Phillip|title=Anthropology : appreciating human diversity|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811699-5|pages=579‚Äì584|edition=14th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-field is also defined as, "the study of relationships between a population of humans and their [[biophysical environment]]".&lt;ref name="Townsend"&gt;{{cite book|last=Townsend|first=Patricia K.|title=Environmental anthropology : from pigs to policies|year=2009|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Ill.|isbn=978-1-57766-581-6|page=104|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of its research concerns "how cultural [[beliefs]] and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments, and how their environment across space and time.&lt;ref name="Kottak CP 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kottak|first1=Conrad P.|jstor=683339|title=The New Ecological Anthropology|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=101|page=23|year=1999|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.23|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227632647}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is [[political ecology]]. Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, century anthropology and more.&lt;ref name="Pyke G 1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pyke|first1=G H|title=Optimal Foraging Theory: A Critical Review|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=15|page=523|year=1984|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.002515|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243636746}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land. Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies). Such is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people of Hyde Park.&lt;ref name="Checker M 2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Melissa Checker|title=Polluted promises: environmental racism and the search for justice in a southern town|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GCcgMi40WkC|date=August 2005|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-1657-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
{{main|Ethnohistory}} {{see also|Historical anthropology}}
Ethnohistory is the study of [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] cultures and [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] customs by examining [[History|historical records]]. It is also the study of the history of various [[ethnic group]]s that may or may not exist today. Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation. Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts. Practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, folklore, oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and place names.&lt;ref name="Axtell1979"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Axtell | first1 = J. | year = 1979 | title = Ethnohistory: An Historian's Viewpoint |  journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 3‚Äì4 | doi = 10.2307/481465 | jstor = 481465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{Anthropology of religion}}
{{main|Anthropology of religion}}
The anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions, and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures. Modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between [[magical thinking]] and religion,&lt;ref name="Cassirer1944"&gt;[[Ernst Cassirer|Cassirer, Ernst]] (1944) [https://books.google.com/books?id=pe9fWSv-iLsC&amp;pg=PA102 ''An Essay On Man''], pt.II, ch.7 ''Myth and Religion'', pp.&amp;nbsp;122‚Äì3.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|"It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion. [note 35: See, for instance, RR Marett, Faith, Hope, and Charity in Primitive Religion, the Gifford Lectures (Macmillan, 1932), Lecture II, pp. 21 ff.]&amp;nbsp;... We have no empirical evidence at all that there ever was an age of magic that has been followed and superseded by an age of religion."&lt;ref name="Cassirer1944"/&gt;}} and that every religion is a cultural product, created by the human [[community]] that worships it.&lt;ref name="Guthrie2000p225"&gt;Guthrie (2000) ''Guide to the Study of Religion''.

=== Urban ===
{{main|Urban anthropology}}
Urban anthropology is concerned with issues of [[urbanization]], poverty, and [[neoliberalism]]. [[Ulf Hannerz]] quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were "a notoriously [[agoraphobic]] lot, anti-urban by definition". Various social processes in the [[Western World]] as well as in the "[[Third World]]" (the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists) brought the attention of "[[Anthropology#Focus on the "other cultures"|specialists in 'other cultures']]" closer to their homes.&lt;ref name=Hannerz/&gt; There are two main approaches to urban anthropology: examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities. These two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other. By defining different types of cities, one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities. By directly looking at the different social issues, one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1466138110370412 |jstor=24047982|title=Chinese consumers: The Romantic reappraisal|journal=Ethnography|volume=11|issue=3|page=331|year=2010|last1=Griffiths|first1=M.

== Key topics by field: archaeological and biological ==
{{main|Archaeological|Biological anthropology}}

=== Anthrozoology ===
{{main|Anthrozoology}}
[[Anthrozoology]] (also known as "human‚Äìanimal studies") is the study of interaction between living things. It is an [[interdisciplinary]] field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including anthropology, [[ethology]], medicine, [[psychology]], [[veterinary medicine]] and [[zoology]].  A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Daniel S (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=vrueZDfPUzoC&amp;pg=PA28 "Anthrozoology"], ''The Encyclopedia of Applied Animal Behaviour and Welfare''. CABI, pp. 28‚Äì30. {{ISBN|0851997244}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes scholars from a diverse range of fields, including anthropology, sociology, biology, and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;DeMello, Margo (2010).

=== Biocultural ===
{{main|Biocultural anthropology}}
Biocultural anthropology is the [[scientific]] exploration of the relationships between [[human biology]] and culture. [[Biological anthropology|Physical anthropologists]] throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] perspective; that is, from the assumption that [[Typology (anthropology)|typological]] human biological differences lead to cultural differences.&lt;ref name=Biocult_syn&gt;{{cite book |last= Goodman |first=Alan H. |author2= Thomas L. Leatherman (eds.) |title=Building A New Biocultural Synthesis |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year= 1998 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=T8ZhpG_B_6MC |isbn= 978-0-472-06606-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology.

=== Evolutionary ===
{{main|Evolutionary anthropology}}
Evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the [[human evolution|evolution]] of [[human physiology]] and [[human behaviour]] and the relation between [[hominins]] and non-hominin [[primate]]s. Evolutionary anthropology is based in [[natural science]] and [[social science]], combining the [[Human development (biology)|human development]] with socioeconomic factors. Evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present. It is based on a [[scientific]] approach, and brings together fields such as [[archaeology]], [[behavioral ecology]], [[psychology]], [[primatology]], and [[genetics]]. It is a dynamic and [[interdisciplinary]] field, drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present.

=== Forensic ===
{{main|Forensic anthropology}}
Forensic anthropology is the application of the science of [[physical anthropology]] and human [[osteology]] in a legal setting, most often in criminal cases where the victim's remains are in the advanced stages of [[decomposition]]. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed, burned, mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable. The adjective "forensic" refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law.

=== Palaeoanthropology ===
{{main|Palaeoanthropology}}
Paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of [[paleontology]] and [[physical anthropology]]. It is the study of ancient humans, as found in [[fossil]] [[Hominidae|hominid]] evidence such as [[Petrifaction|petrifacted]] bones and footprints.

== Organizations ==
Contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges. The single largest organization of anthropologists is the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA), which was founded in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/about/ AAAnet.org]. AAAnet.org. Retrieved on 2016-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Its members are anthropologists from around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100613021448/http://aaanet.org/membership/upload/MAY-08-AAA.pdf AAAnet.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, a group of European and American scholars in the field of anthropology established the [[European Association of Social Anthropologists]] (EASA) which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in Europe. The EASA seeks to advance the status of anthropology in Europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology.

Hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub-fields of anthropology, sometimes divided up by nation or region, and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines, such as [[geology]], [[physics]], [[zoology]], [[paleontology]], [[anatomy]], [[music theory]], [[art history]], [[sociology]] and so on, belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, Donald and Wong, Kate (2007).

==Ethics==
As the field has matured it has debated and arrived at ethical principles aimed at protecting both the subjects of anthropological research as well as the researchers themselves, and professional societies have generated codes of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report of the Commission to Review the AAA Statements on Ethics - Participate &amp; Advocate|url=http://www.americananthro.org/ParticipateAndAdvocate/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=1911&amp;RDtoken=3371&amp;userID=6944|publisher=American Anthropological Association|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists, like other researchers (especially historians and scientists engaged in field research), have over time assisted state policies and projects, especially colonialism.&lt;ref name = "pbuteh"&gt;Asad, Talal, ed. (1973) ''Anthropology &amp; the Colonial Encounter.'' Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Breman, Jan, and Akitoshi Shimizu (1999) ''Anthropology and Colonialism in Asia and Oceania''. Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have contended:
* That the discipline grew out of colonialism, perhaps was in league with it, and derives some of its key notions from it, consciously or not. (See, for example, Gough, Pels and Salemink, but cf. Lewis 2004).&lt;ref name=Gellner&gt;Gellner, Ernest (1992) [http://okhovvat.com/files/en/content/2011/6/4/351_379.pdf ''Postmodernism, Reason, and Religion'']. London/New York: Routledge. pp. 26‚Äì29. {{ISBN|041508024X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* That ethnographic work is often [[Ahistoricism|ahistorical]], writing about people as if they were "out of time" in an "ethnographic present" (Johannes Fabian, ''Time and Its Other'').

=== Cultural relativism ===
As part of their quest for [[scientific objectivity]], present-day anthropologists typically urge [[cultural relativism]], which has an influence on all the sub-fields of anthropology.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994p331"/&gt; This is the notion that cultures should not be judged by another's values or viewpoints, but be examined dispassionately on their own terms. There should be no notions, in good anthropology, of one culture being better or worse than another culture.&lt;ref&gt;Levi-Strauss, Claude (1962). ''The Savage Mind''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Womack, Mari (2001). ''Being Human.''.{{Page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting [[genocide]], [[infanticide]], [[racism]], [[mutilation]] (including [[circumcision]] and [[subincision]]), and [[torture]]. Topics like racism, slavery, and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Marvin. ''Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches''.&lt;/ref&gt; to genes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=209831&amp;sectioncode=26 Is there a gene for racism? | Times Higher Education (THE)]. Times Higher Education (2016-10-27). Retrieved on 2016-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[acculturation]] have been proposed, not to mention theories of [[colonialism]] and many others as root causes of [[Man's inhumanity to man]]. To illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach, one can take just one of these topics, such as "racism" and find thousands of anthropological references, stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on "Race"|url=http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm|publisher=American Anthropological Association|date=May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.282.5389.654 |pmid=9841421 |title=CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY:DNA Studies Challenge the Meaning of Race |journal=Science |volume=282 |issue=5389 |pages=654‚Äì5 |year=1998 |last1=Marshall |first1=E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Allan (1995).

Ortiz|url=https://www.academia.edu/199944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military involvement===
Anthropologists' involvement with the U.S. government, in particular, has caused bitter controversy within the discipline. Franz Boas publicly objected to US participation in World War I, and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several American archaeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

But by the 1940s, many of Boas' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the [[Axis Powers]] (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan). Many served in the armed forces, while others worked in intelligence (for example, [[Office of Strategic Services]] and the [[Office of War Information]]). At the same time, [[David Price (anthropologist)|David H. Price]]'s work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence activities during the Vietnam War years have turned up surprisingly little. Many anthropologists (students and teachers) were active in the antiwar movement.  Numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the [[State (polity)|state]]. Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings. The [[Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth]] (ASA) has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous. The AAA's current 'Statement of Professional Responsibility' clearly states that "in relation with their own government and with host governments&amp;nbsp;... no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given."{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Anthropologists, along with other social scientists, are working with the US military as part of the US Army's strategy in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0907/p01s08-wosc.htm US Army's strategy in Afghanistan: better anthropology].

==Post‚ÄìWorld War II developments==
Before WWII British 'social anthropology' and American 'cultural anthropology' were still distinct traditions. After the war, enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as 'sociocultural' anthropology.

===Basic trends===
There are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work. One of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more [[Holism|holistic]] account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical.&lt;ref name="Hylland Eriksen 2004 p. 79"/&gt; The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place, problem or phenomenon in detail, using a variety of methods, over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia.

In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato (1993).  ''Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis''. Beacon Press. Inda&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xavier, John and Rosaldo, Renato (2007).  ''The Anthropology of Globalization''. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation&lt;ref&gt;Jurmain, Robert; Kilgore, Lynn; Trevathan, Wenda and Ciochon, Russell L. (2007).  ''Introduction to Physical Anthropology''. 11th Edition. Wadsworth. chapters I, III and IV. {{ISBN|0495187798}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wompack, Mari (2001). ''Being Human''. Prentice Hall. pp.&amp;nbsp;11‚Äì20. {{ISBN|0136440711}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the possibility of human universals (behaviors, ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Donald (1991).  ''Human Universals''. McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roughley, Neil (2000).  ''Being Humans: Anthropological Universality and Particularity in Transciplinary Perspectives''. Walter de Gruyter Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;  They use many different methods of study, but modern population [[genetics]], [[participant observation]] and other techniques often take anthropologists "into the field," which means traveling to a community in its own setting, to do something called "fieldwork."  On the biological or physical side, human measurements, genetic samples, nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs.

Along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis, anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions. Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material, such as the [[Paleolithic]] and the [[Neolithic]], of particular use in archaeology.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as [[Olduwan]] or [[Mousterian]] or [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to [[culture regions]] as well, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences. By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of [[comparative method]], a central part of their science.

===Commonalities between fields===
Because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises (see [[History of anthropology]]), including but not limited to [[Fossil collecting|fossil-hunting]], [[Exploration|exploring]], documentary film-making, [[paleontology]], [[primatology]], antiquity dealings and curatorship, [[philology]], [[etymology]], [[genetics]], regional analysis, [[ethnology]], history, [[philosophy]], and [[religious studies]],&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Paul A. and Liam D. Murphy (2003). ''A History of Anthropological Theory''. Broadview Press. pp.&amp;nbsp;11‚Äì12. {{ISBN|1442601108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George (1992) "Paradigmatic Traditions in the History of Anthropology", pp. 342‚Äì361 in George Stocking, ''The Ethnographer's Magic and Other Essays in the History of Anthropology''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. {{ISBN|0299134148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article, although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Leaf, Murray (1979). ''Man, Mind and Science: A History of Anthropology.'' Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of "other cultures", both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-Western societies).&lt;ref&gt;See the many essays relating to this in Prem Poddar and David Johnson, Historical Companion to Postcolonial Thought in English, Edinburgh University Press, 2004. See also Prem Poddar et al., Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures‚ÄîContinental Europe and its Empires, Edinburgh University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the classic of [[urban anthropology]], [[Ulf Hannerz]] in the introduction to his seminal ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'' mentions that the "[[Third World]]" had habitually received most of attention; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in "other cultures" looked for them far away and started to look "across the tracks" only in late 1960s.&lt;ref name=Hannerz&gt;[[Ulf Hannerz|Hannerz, Ulf]] (1980) ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'', {{ISBN|0-231-08376-9}}, p. 1. ISBN Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author's "home".&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Lewis, Herbert S. (1998) ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/682051 The Misrepresentation of Anthropology and its Consequences]'' ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' "100:" 716‚Äì731&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that other fields of study, like History and [[Sociology]], on the contrary focus disproportionately on the West.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody|Goody, Jack]] (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC The Theft of History]''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-87069-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the study of Western societies has been traditionally left to [[sociologist]]s, but this is increasingly changing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ab√©l√®s | first1 = Marc | year = | title = How the Anthropology of France Has Changed Anthropology in France: Assessing New Directions in the Field |journal = [[Cultural Anthropology (journal)|Cultural Anthropology]] | volume = 1999 | issue = | page = 407 | jstor = 08867356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; starting in the 1970s from scholars like Isac Chiva and journals like ''[[Terrain (journal)|Terrain]]'' ("fieldwork"), and developing with the center founded by [[Marc Aug√©]] (''[[√âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales|Le Centre d'anthropologie des mondes contemporains]]'', the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies).

Since the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the North Atlantic region, frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale. There has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people; increasingly, research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories, social movements, governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Michael M. J. (2003) ''Emergent Forms of Life and the Anthropological Voice''. Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aquae Calidae'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aquae-calidae.com/en&lt;/ref&gt; (Latin for warm waters), also known as Therma and Thermopolis in the Middle Ages, was an ancient town in [[Thrace]] located in the territory of today's Bulgarian port city of Burgas. It was built around thermal baths using the hot springs and became one of the most important spa centres of ancient times.

The site and baths of Aquae Calidae have been visited in the course of history by several important rulers from  [[Philip II of Macedon]] to the Eastern Roman emperors [[Justinian I]] and [[Constantine IV]], the Bulgarian ruler Terwel and the Ottoman Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].

Aquae Calidae is shown on the Tabula Peutingeriana (edition of Konrad Miller, 1887).

==History==

Archaeology has shown that the hot springs were already used in the Neolithic between the 6th and 5th millennium BC. The [[Thracians]] built a sanctuary of the Three Nymphs in the 1st millennium BC around the spring. In the 4th century BC Philip II of Macedon conquered the region and according to legend, he was a frequent guest here.&lt;ref&gt;Tsonya Drajeva, Dimcho Momchilov: Akve Khalide - Therma, the city of the hot mineral baths Burgas, Bulgaria. Burgas Regional Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

The over 4,000 coins found show the cosmopolitan nature of visitors from many regions of Europe as they originated from ancient Greece and Italy as well as from [[Kabyle (ancient city)|Kabyle]], Mesambria (now [[Nessebar]]), [[Varna|Odessos]], [[Histria (ancient city)|Histria]], [[Constan»õa|Tomis]], [[Byzantium]], [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]], [[Maroneia]] and the islands of the Aegean, the oldest from [[Apollonia Pontica]] from the 5th century BC.

[[File:Burgas-Archeology-museum-three-nymphs.jpg|thumb|Three nymphs from Aquae Calidae (2nd c.), Burgas Archaeology museum]]

The first baths at the Sanctuary of the Three Nymphs originated when the Roman Empire under [[Lucullus]] conquered the region, during the [[Third Mithridatic War]] in 72 BC. Under [[Trajan]] (98-117) nearby [[Pomorie|Anchialos]] became the administrative centre of the region and the baths were expanded and extended with two more swimming pools. During this time the [[Via Pontica]] was built connecting Constantinople via [[Deultum]], Anchialos, Aquae Calidae with [[Dorostorum]] and [[Sexaginta Prista]] on the Danube. Near the baths a road station (statio milliaria) was created with the name Aquae Calidae.

The Sanctuary of the Three Nymphs continued to exist next to the station and the Baths, and became known as the Nymphaeum of Anchialos. Under [[Septimius Severus]] in 209-211 three years of games and celebrations under the name  of Severia Nymphaea took place in the baths. Games also took place in Aquae Calidae under the emperors [[Geta (emperor)|Geta]] and [[Caracalla]].&lt;ref&gt;Ralph F. Hoddinott: Bulgaria in Antiquity. An archeological introduction , Ernest Benn Ltd., London, 1975, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jordanes]], who lived in the 6th century, described in his work Getica the incursions of Gothic tribes on the southern Black Sea coast of Thrace in 270. He reported that the Goths, after the conquest of Anchialos, moved to hot springs ("aquarum calidarum") twelve miles from Anchialos and stayed there for several days to recover.&lt;ref&gt;Jordanes, Getica 20, 109 (p.86 ed Theodor Mommsen (ed.): Auctores antiquissimi 5.1: Iordanis Romana et Getica, Berlin 1882 ( Monumenta Germaniae Historica , digitized )): "Ibi ergo multis feruntur mansisse diebus aquarum calidarum delectati lavacris, quae ad duodecimo miliario anchialitanae civitatis sunt siti, ab imo suae fontis ignei scaturrientes, et reliqua totius mundi thermarum innumerabilum loca omnino precipua et ad sanitatem infirmorum efficacisima "; Herwig Wolfram : The Goths. 4th edition, CH Beck, Munich 2001, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The baths were restored and expanded at the end of the 4th or early the 5th century. According to [[Procopius]] of Caesarea fortress walls were also built around the city under Emperor [[Justinian I]] as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Procopius of Caesarea: De Aedificiis 3, 7, 18-23&lt;/ref&gt;

    "... Thracians live in a port city of Euxeinos Pontos named Anchialos, [...] not far from the city springs water from natural, warm springs, which serve as baths of the local population. This settlement, which was not fortified since ancient times, was not perceived by the ancient emperors, even though barbarians settled nearby and the sick visited them at the risk of their lives. But now Emperor Justinian has surrounded them with walls and made the healing harmless. " 

The Eastern Roman Emperor [[Tiberius II Constantine]] chose the city for the cure of a disease of his wife Anastasia. When this healing was successful in around 580, she gave the local church her imperial robes. In 584 the Avars under [[Bayan (khan)|Khan Baian]] conquered Aquae Calidae, but Baian spared the baths at the request of his harem.&lt;ref&gt;The interpretation of this episode (handed down in the Syrian World Chronicle of Michael Syrus 2, 362 from the 12th century) is controversial, cf. to Walter Pohl : The Avars. CH Beck, Munich 2002, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the churches of the city the Avars found the imperial robes of Anastasia and Baian took them and allegedly claimed control of the empire.

==Archaeology==

The first archaeological excavations were by Bogdan Filov in 1910. In the pools he found over 4,000 coins of various eras, jewelry and other everyday items dated from the 5th to the 13th century.

Since 2008 large-scale excavation and reconstruction has taken place. By 2010, an area of more than 3,800 sq. m  was uncovered, including the ancient thermal spas, the north gate and parts of the 5m thick city walls. 

The city covered 10 sq. km and the walled part some 2 sq. km.

In July 2011, an area of 36,000 m¬≤ was declared an archaeological reserve.

'''William Basil Jones''' (1822‚Äì1897) was a Welsh bishop and scholar who became the [[Bishop of St David's]] in 1874, holding the post until his death in 1897.

==Personal history==
Jones was born on 1 January 1822 in [[Cheltenham]] to William Tilsey Jones of [[Gwynfryn, Ceredigion|Gwynfryn]] and his wife Jane.&lt;ref name="NLoW"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-JONE-BAS-1822.html | title=Jones, William Basil (Tickell) (1822‚Äì1897) | work=The Dictionary of Welsh Biography, Down to 1940 | accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Shrewsbury School]], under the tutelage of Samuel Hall and [[Benjamin Hall Kennedy]] from 1834 to 1841, becoming head boy in his final year.&lt;ref name="DoNB"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.llangynfelyn.org/dogfennau/william_basil_DNB.html | title=William Basil Jones, Bishop of St Davids | work=Dictionary of National Biography | accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1842 he matriculated to [[Trinity College, Oxford]]. He was placed in the second class in his final school of ''literae humaniores'' and in 1845 he graduated BA, receiving his MA in 1847.&lt;ref name="DoNB"/&gt; In 1848 Jones was elected to a Michel fellowship at [[Queen's College, Oxford|Queen's College]], but in 1851 he exchanged it for a fellowship at [[University College, Oxford]], which he held until 1857. During his time as a fellow at University College he became assistant tutor and [[bursar]], and from 1858 through to 1865 was a lecturer in modern history and the classics. He left Oxford in 1865.&lt;ref name="DoNB"/&gt;

During his time as a lecturer Jones married his first wife, Frances Charlotte Holworthy, second daughter of Samuel Holworthy, vicar of [[Croxall]]. They were married on 10 September 1856 and remained together until Frances' death on 21 September 1881; the couple remaining childless. Jones remarried on 2 December 1896, to Anne Loxdale. Anne bore him a son and two daughters and survived her husband.&lt;ref name="DoNB"/&gt;

While at Oxford, Jones showed himself to have a keen interest in archaeological and architectural affairs. He is credited for the design of his parish church at Llangynfelyn. From 1848 through to 1851 he was one of the general secretaries of the [[Cambrian Archaeological Association]], and then joint editor of its journal, ''[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]'', in 1854. Jones was also secretary of the Oxford Architectural Society, and was part of a literary and philosophical society at Trinity known as ''Hermes''. The society included other notable Trinity students, [[George Bowen]], [[William Gifford Palgrave]] and [[Edward Augustus Freeman]], all of whom were friends of Jones.&lt;ref name="DoNB"/&gt; Of his friendships made at Oxford, the one that endured was that with [[William Thomson (bishop)|William Thomson]] who was also a past student at Shrewsbury School at the same time as Jones. Jones had been ordained [[deacon]] in 1848, and a priest in 1853, but after Thomson was made [[Bishop of Gloucester]] in 1861 he made Jones his examining chaplain.&lt;ref name="NLoW"/&gt; When Thomson was elevated to the office of [[Archbishop of York]] the next year he ensured that Jones was always close as an advisor, ensuring he held important posts in the York diocese, and in 1865 was presented with the vicarage of [[Bishopthorpe]], where the episcopal palace is situated.&lt;ref name="DoNB"/&gt; Jones was soon recognised as Thomson's 'right-hand man', and a series of favourable appointments followed, with Jones becoming the Archdeacon of York in 1867, the rural dean of Bishopthorpe in 1869 and the chancellor of York in 1871.&lt;ref name="DoNB"/&gt;

==Bishop of St David's==
In 1874 [[Connop Thirlwall]], the Bishop of St David's, resigned the see and Jones was appointed as his successor by Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]].&lt;ref name="DoNB"/&gt; His selection is believed to have been influenced by his scholarly work, his proven history as a clerical administrator, his past association with the [[Diocese of St David's]] and his ability, although limited, to speak [[Welsh language|Welsh]].&lt;ref name="DoNB"/&gt; Jones in his earlier life had shown an interest in [[St David's Cathedral]], raising a fund while at Oxford University for the restoration of the [[rood screen]]. He had also, along with his friend Edward Augustus Freeman, undertaken in writing an in-depth history of the cathedral.&lt;ref name="DoNB"/&gt;

Jones was consecrated bishop by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Archibald Tait]], at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 14 August 1874, and was enthroned at St David's on 15 September of the same year.&lt;ref name="DoNB"/&gt; Jones, in his role as Bishop of St David's, continued the restoration work on existing churches but paid far more focus on the establishment of new mission churches; the number of churches consecrated by him annually was treble the figure of his predecessor.&lt;ref name="DoNB"/&gt; He also brought a far stricter regimen to the selection of candidates for ordination, requiring good testimonials, and preferring well educated men to those who were good orators.&lt;ref name="DoNB"/&gt; He also oversaw changes which saw the removal of non-resident posts, resulting in improvements in pastoral work. These improvements led to a progressive raising of the educational and spiritual standard of the ministry.&lt;ref name="DoNB"/&gt; After Jones' death, his successor, [[John Owen (bishop of St David's)|John Owen]], wrote: 'The progress of the diocese during Bishop Jones' episcopate was far greater than the progress during any period of equal length since the Reformation', though it is recognised that much of his work built on reforms initiated by Thirlwall and before him [[Thomas Burgess (bishop)|Thomas Burgess]].&lt;ref name="DoNB"/&gt;

During his time as the Bishop of St David's, a proposed division of the diocese, then the largest in Wales, was initiated. Jones was unhappy with the suggestion, but he accepted a reduced income to the diocese on condition that the endowment left would be larger than that of the other Welsh diocese.&lt;ref name="DoNB"/&gt;

In his role of Bishop of St David's, Jones had wide ranging powers in the constitutional development of [[St David's College, Lampeter]]. Jones took this opportunity to enact the college with a complete code of statutes (1879) instead of the few provisional rules which it previously held.&lt;ref name="DoNB"/&gt; He also took an active part in the government of [[Christ's College, Brecon]], becoming chairman of its board of governors in 1880.&lt;ref name="DoNB"/&gt;

He died at Abergwili Palace on 14 January 1897, and was buried six days later in the family vault at Llangynfelyn.&lt;ref name="DoNB"/&gt;

There are several varieties of bezoar, some of which have [[inorganic]] constituents and others [[organic compound|organic]]. The term has both a modern (medical, scientific) and a traditional usage.

==Types ==
===By content===
* '''Food [[bolus (digestion)|bolus]]es''' (or boli; singular bolus) carry the archaic and positive meaning of bezoar, and are composed of loose aggregates of food items such as seeds, fruit pith, or pits, as well as other types of items such as [[shellac]], [[bubble gum]], soil, and concretions of some medications.
* '''Lactobezoar''' is a specific type of food bezoar comprising [[inspissated]] milk. It is most commonly seen in premature infants receiving formula foods.
* '''Pharmacobezoars''' (or medication bezoars) are mostly tablets or semiliquid masses of drugs, normally found following [[overdose]] of [[sustained-release]] medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buckley NA, Dawson AH, Reith DA |title=Controlled release drugs in overdose.

Humans who frequently consume hair sometimes require these to be removed.  The [[Rapunzel syndrome]], a very rare and extreme case, may require surgery.

===By location===
*A bezoar in the [[esophagus]] is common in young children and in [[horse]]s.  In horses, it is known as [[Choke (horse)|choke]].
*A bezoar in the [[large intestine]] is known as a [[fecaloma|fecalith]].
*A bezoar in the [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]] is called a tracheobezoar.

==Cause==
* Esophageal bezoars in the nasogastrically fed patients on mechanical ventilation and sedation have been reported to be due to precipitation of certain food types rich in casein, which get precipitated with gastric acid reflux to form esophageal bezoars.
* Ox bezoars (cow bezoars) are used in [[Chinese herbology]], where they are called ''[[niu-huang]]'' (ÁâõÈªÉ) or ''[[calculus bovis]]''. These are gallstones, or substitutes, from ox or cattle gall bladder bile. There are artificial calculus bovis used as substitutes. These are manufactured from cholic acid derived from bovine bile.&lt;ref&gt;Ingredients, '''AN KUNG NIU HUANG WAN''' (''Bezoar Chest Functioning Pills''), Peking Tung Jen Tang, Peking, China. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  In some products, they claim to remove "toxins" from the body.

==History==
Bezoars had value because they were believed to have the power of a universal [[antidote]] against any [[poison]].  Tradition held that a drinking glass which contained a bezoar would neutralize any poison poured into it.  The word "bezoar" comes from the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''pƒÅd-zahr'' ({{lang|fa|ŸæÿßÿØÿ≤Ÿáÿ±}}), which literally means "antidote."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.etymonline.com/word/bezoar&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] physician [[Ibn Zuhr]] (d. 1161), known in the West as Avenzoar, is thought{{by whom|date=September 2016}} to have made the earliest description of bezoar stones as medicinal items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Byrne|first= Joseph P.|title= Encyclopedia of the Black Death|publisher= ABC-CLIO|isbn= 1598842536|page= 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive reference to bezoars also appears in the ''[[Picatrix]]'', which may have originated earlier.

In 1575, French surgeon [[Ambroise Par√©]] described an experiment to test the properties of the bezoar stone. At the time, the bezoar stone was deemed able to cure the effects of any poison, but Par√© believed this was impossible. It happened that a cook at King's court was caught stealing fine silver cutlery and was sentenced to death by hanging. The cook agreed to be poisoned instead. Ambroise Par√© then used the bezoar stone to no great avail, as the cook died in agony seven hours after taking poison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Ambroise Par√© and His Times, 1510‚Äì1590 |author= Stephen Paget |authorlink= Stephen Paget|year= 1897 |publisher= G.P. Putnam's Sons |url= https://books.google.com/?id=s2PsYxqqiSIC |pages= 186‚Äì187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Par√© had proved that the bezoar stone could not cure all poisons, contrary to popular belief at the time.

Modern examinations of the properties of bezoars by Gustaf Arrhenius and Andrew A. Benson of the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] have shown that they could, when immersed in an arsenic-laced solution, remove the poison. The toxic compounds in arsenic are [[arsenate]] and [[Arsenic trioxide|arsenite]]. Each is acted upon differently, but effectively, by bezoar stones. Arsenate is removed by being exchanged for phosphate in the mineral brushite, a crystalline structure found in the stones. Arsenite is found to bond to sulfur compounds in the protein of degraded hair, which is a key component in bezoars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melfisher.org/bezoar.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116102735/http://www.melfisher.org/bezoar.htm |archivedate=2013-01-16 |df= }} [dead link]&lt;/ref&gt;

A famous case in the [[common law]] of [[England]] (''[[Chandelor v Lopus]]'', 79 Eng Rep. 3, Cro. Jac. 4, [[Exchequer|Eng. Ct. Exch.]] 1603) announced the rule of ''[[caveat emptor]]'' ("let the buyer beware") if the goods they purchased are not in fact genuine and effective. The case concerned a purchaser who sued for the return of the purchase price of an allegedly [[fraud]]ulent bezoar.  (The law report does not discuss how the [[plaintiff]] discovered that the bezoar did not work.)

Bezoars were important objects in cabinets of curiosity and natural history collections, especially for their use in early modern pharmacy and the study of animal health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heintzman|first1=Kit|title=A cabinet of the ordinary: domesticating veterinary education, 1766‚Äì1799|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|date=2018|doi=10.1017/S0007087418000274|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/6021EB7317F4B67F6EBC150842D267E4/S0007087418000274a.pdf/div-class-title-a-cabinet-of-the-ordinary-domesticating-veterinary-education-1766-1799-div.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peter Borschberg|last2=Michael North (ed.)|title=The Euro-Asian trade in bezoar stones (approx. 1500 to 1700)|date=2010|publisher=Ashgate|location=Burlington|url=https://www.routledge.com/Artistic-and-Cultural-Exchanges-between-Europe-and-Asia-1400-1900-Rethinking/North/p/book/9780754669371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy]]'' notes that consumption of unripened [[persimmon]]s has been identified as causing epidemics of intestinal bezoars, and that up to 90% of bezoars that occur from eating too much of the fruit require surgery for removal.&lt;ref&gt;Merck Manual, Rahway, New Jersey, Sixteenth Edition, Gastrointestinal Disorders, Section 52, p. 780&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study recorded that a patient with a standard gastric bezoar was treated successfully with 2 weeks of administered [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]], after which the stone was dissolved with no adverse side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gao|first=Feng|last2=Gao|first2=Ru|last3=Hao|first3=Jian Yu|last4=Jia|first4=Ji Dong|date=January 2012|title=Gastric bezoar: a case of a patient treated with traditional Chinese medicine|journal=Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine |volume=18|issue=1|pages=93‚Äì95|doi=10.1089/acm.2010.0794|issn=1557-7708|pmid=22268973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 review of three databases identified 24 publications presenting 46 patients treated with [[Coca-Cola]] for phytobezoars. The cola was administered in doses of 500 mL to up to 3000 mL over 24 hours, orally or by gastric lavage.

'''Carl Johan Calleman''', (born 15 May 1950, [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]), is a [[toxicology|toxicologist]] as well as an author and speaker on the [[millenarianism|millenarian]] [[New Age]] interpretation of the [[Mayan calendar]] known as [[Mayanism]]. He differs from professional [[Mayanist]]s in seeing 28 October 2011 and not 21 December 2012 as a significant date. Calleman does not interpret the date as an [[apocalypse]], [[Armageddon]], or other [[wikt:cataclysmic|cataclysmic]] event but a slow transformation of consciousness in which people experience a higher "unity consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delo.si/clanek/162578 Mexico attracts tourists due to predictions of the end of the world] EN Trip, Delo.si , 13.07.2011 (Slovenian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/8850657/The-end-of-the-world-is-nigh-or-is-it.html|title=The end of the world is nigh&amp;nbsp;‚Äì or is it?|author=[[Bryony Gordon]]|date=26 Oct 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=28 October 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Calleman studied [[toxicology]] at the [[University of Stockholm]] in Sweden.
&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.calleman.com/content/biographical.htm Carl Johan Calleman] Personal Biography, July 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  He has had no professional training in archaeology or the study of the ancient Maya.

He first encountered the Mayan calendar on a visit to Mexico and Guatemala in 1979. He became fascinated with the concept of a calendar that had an "end date" and was influenced by the works of [[Michael D. Coe]].&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

In 1986 he took a post at the Department of Environmental Health at the [[University of Washington in Seattle]] as a [[cancer]] researcher. As a result of work done in that post and in China he was appointed as an expert for the [[World Health Organization]] on cancer.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

In 1993 he returned to Sweden and devoted himself full-time to researching and writing about the calendar. He published a short book in Swedish on the subject in 1994, ''Mayahypotesen''. In 1998 he was invited to be one of the main speakers at a conference about the Mayan calendar in [[M√©rida, Yucat√°n|M√©rida]], Yucat√°n. This inspired him to write a more widely accessible book, ''The Mayan Calendar'' published in 2001. A second popular book ''The Mayan Calendar and the Transformation of Consciousness'' followed in 2004, and a third ''Purposeful Universe: How Quantum Theory and Mayan Cosmology Explain the Origin and Evolution of Life '' in 2009.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

He lives in [[Orsa, Sweden]] and lectures worldwide.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

==Beliefs==
Calleman's beliefs differ from other interpreters of the Mayan calendar and the [[2012 phenomenon]] in that he sees the crucial date for change as 28 October 2011‚Äînot 21 December 2012‚Äîwhich he postulates will see the culmination of a series of nine waves of increasing frequency which have influenced, and continue to influence, the development and evolution of both the physical universe and human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthywealthynwise.com/article.aspx?author=Ric%20Thompson&amp;title=Carl%20Johan%20Calleman%20-%20Energy%20Cycles%20and%202012&amp;Article=5714 Carl Johan Calleman - Energy Cycles and 2012] Ric Thompson, Healthy, Wealthy and Wise.com, Interview, June 2009. Accessed August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|B7Xt1IUs_Hg|9th wave of the Mayan Calendar ending on 28th October 2011 - Dr Calleman}} Lilou Mace interview, Jun 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|l6esQh8tDWo|On the Mayan Calendar in 2011 (Carl Calleman)}} , swernig on May 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exopolitik.org/wissen/zukunftswissenschaften/bewusstsein/641-mayakalender-ausblick-auf-den-fuenften-tag-der-neunten-unterwelt Maya Calendar] Exopolitik Detchland. 23 July 2011 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://barikad.hu/maj%C3%A1k_%C3%A9s_kapitalizmus_%C3%B6sszeoml%C3%A1sa-20110806 The Mayans and the collapse of capitalism] barikad.hu Aug. 6 2011. (Hungarian)&lt;/ref&gt;  His ideas represent a revival of theories of [[unilineal evolution]].

Calleman disagrees that 2012 represents the point of an alignment between the Earth's solstice and the galactic centre which he says would be a purely local phenomenon unique to the Earth and which in any case already occurred in 1998. Instead he sees the Mayan calendar as describing the creation process of the whole Universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calleman.com/content/articles/end_of_creationcycles.htm Why the Creation Cycles do not end  December 21 2012, but October 28, 2011] Carl Joahan Calleman, May 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the logic of the [[Maya calendar|Mayan Long Count]], he says, an auspicious end would have to be on a day which is  13 Ahau in the [[Tzolk'in|tzolkin]] count.  Since 21 December 2012 falls on 4 Ahau this is an unlikely end date. The 28 October 2011 is a 13 Ahau date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calleman.com/content/articles/risk_of_2012.htm The risks of believing that the Mayan calendar ends December 21, 2012!] Carl Joahan Calleman, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the [[Big Bang]] he believes creation has continued through a series of waves, each one a factor of 20 times shorter in duration than the one preceding it. Each wave has driven the structure of the universe to a higher level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calleman.com/content/articles/astrology.htm Is the Mayan Calendar the astrology of our time?] Carl Johan Calleman&lt;/ref&gt;
The first wave drove the creation of physical matter, the second living cells, the third multicellular life, the fourth organisms living in family groups, the fifth, saw humans in tribal groups, and the sixth in national groups. The seventh wave encompasses human awareness of the whole planet, and the eighth awareness of our place in the galactic structure.&lt;ref name="EvolveCJC"&gt;[http://www.calleman.com/content/articles/enlightenment.htm http://www.calleman.com/content/articles/enlightenment.htm Evolving Towards Enlightenment] Carl Johan Calleman&lt;/ref&gt; The final wave, the ninth and shortest of all, began on 8 March 2011 and will complete along with all the others on 28 October 2011 sees awareness of the whole of the cosmos achieved. Rather than the series ending with an Apocalypse he describes it as the completion of the creation process of the Universe. The way will then be open to the full realisation of consciousness at its highest level which he terms "Unity consciousness".&lt;ref name="EvolveCJC"/&gt;

'''Color symbolism''' in [[art]] and [[anthropology]] refers to the use of color as a [[symbol]] in various [[Culture|cultures]]. There is great diversity in the use of colors and their associations between cultures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith|first=N.S. |last2=Whitfield|first2=T.W.A. |last3=Wiltshire|first3=T.J. |date=April 1990 |title=The accuracy of the NCS, DIN, and OSA-UCS colour atlases |journal=Color Research &amp; Application |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=111‚Äì116 |doi=10.1002/col.5080150209 |issn=0361-2317}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even within the same culture in different time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Color psychology and color therapy: a factual study of the influence of color on human life |last=Birren |first=Faber |date=2006 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn=978-1425424107 |location=Whitefish, MT |oclc=74452551}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same color may have very different associations within the same culture at any time. Diversity in color symbolism occurs because color meanings and symbolism occur on an individual, cultural and universal basis. Color symbolism is also context-dependent and influenced by changes over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Color symbolism |doi=10.5040/9781501303364.ch-014 |title=Color Studies |editor1=Edith Anderson Feisner |editor2=Ronald Reed |edition=3rd |year=2016 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=New York |isbn=978-1-50130-336-4 |oclc=1053938255 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic representations of religious concepts or articles may include a specific color with which the concept or object is associated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |language=de |title=Encyclopaedia Britannica|doi=10.1163/9789004337862_lgbo_com_050367 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence to suggest that colors have been used for this purpose as early as 90,000 BC.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==Color symbolism in marketing==
Color plays an important role in setting expectations for a product and communicating its key characteristics.&lt;ref name=Asiam&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Aslam |first=Mubeen M. |date=2006 |title=Are You Selling the Right Colour? A Cross‚ÄêCultural Review of Colour as a Marketing Cue |journal=Journal of Marketing Communications |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=15‚Äì30 |doi=10.1080/13527260500247827}}&lt;/ref&gt; Color is the second most important element that allows consumers to identify brand packaging.&lt;ref name=Popa&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Popa|first=C.N. |last2=Popescu|first2=S. |last3=Berehoiu|first3=R.M.T. |last4=Berehoiu|first4=S.M.T. |date=2013 |title=Considerations regarding use and role of colour in marketing |url=http://managementjournal.usamv.ro/pdf/vol.XIII/Art44.pdf |journal= Scientific Papers Series - Management, Economic Engineering in Agriculture and Rural Development |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=269‚Äì274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketers for products with an international market navigate the color symbolism variances between cultures with targeted advertising. The car manufacturer, Volkswagen ran a commercial in Italy with a black sheep in the middle of a larger flock symbolizing those who owned a VW Golf as someone unique and self-assured among a crowd of others who were not. In several cultures around the world, a black sheep represents an outcast and is seen as something undesirable. In Italy, a black sheep represents confidence and independence.[[File:Friaul Val Aupa Drentus Sheep credit Kaspar Nickles 2017.jpg|thumb|Friaul Val Aupa Drentus Sheep credit Kaspar Nickles 2017]] There are many additional variances in color symbolism between cultures. Cold is symbolized by blue in East Asia, the USA, and Sweden while warmth is symbolized by yellow in the USA and by blue in The Netherlands. Sometimes the meanings of colors are in stark opposition across geographic boundaries, requiring products marketed to specific demographics to account for those changes across different markets. For instance, feminity is symbolized by blue in The Netherlands and pink in the USA., whereas masculinity is symbolized by blue in Sweden and the USA, and red in the UK and France.&lt;ref name=Asiam/&gt; In some instances color symbolism in marketing is constructed. For companies whose products are defined by the name of their color their sales are susceptible to the symbolism and association of that name. In one example, a company selling a paint color named ‚Äúoff white‚Äù more than doubled its sales by renaming the same color as ‚Äúancient silk.‚Äù&lt;ref name=Popa/&gt;

==Conceptualizations of colors cross-culturally==
Color symbolism has morphed over time. Between the 5th and 17th centuries color was largely related to in a religious context. Blue was symbolic of heaven and white of purity. Today, purity is still symbolized by white in Australia and the USA but by blue in other countries like India. Similarly, the church influenced the perception of colors like crimson and purple. Largely because the dyes for these colors could only be sourced from precious pigments, religious figures like Madonna, Cardinals, and the Virgin were seen in scarlet and purple. [[File:Vatican II - Dubois - Li√©nart.JPG|thumb|Vatican II - Dubois - Li√©nart]]Today, purple symbolizes evil and infidelity in Japan, but the same is symbolized by blue in East Asia and by yellow in France. Additionally, the sacred color of Hindu and Buddhist monks is orange. [[File:Preah Pithu T Monks - Siem Reap.jpg|thumb|Preah Pithu T Monks - Siem Reap]] The Renaissance was also a time in which black and purple were colors of mourning. Today, Mourning or death is symbolized by white in East Asia, black in the USA, and blue in Iran, while happiness is symbolized by white in Australia and NZ, and yellow in China.&lt;ref name=Asiam/&gt;

There is a general disagreement over whether reactions to color and their symbolism are a result of cultural conditioning or of instinct. Several studies concluded that color is part of the social learning process because of the significant symbolism within the culture. High quality, trustworthiness and dependability are symbolized by blue in the USA, Japan, Korea and green and yellow in China - as well as purple in China, South Korea and Japan. Because of these variances, critical cues vary across cultures. Warning signs are coded differently as danger is symbolized by green in Malaysia, and red in the USA and Mexico. The same color of green symbolizes envy in Belgium and the USA, but envy is symbolized by yellow in Germany and Russia, and purple in Mexico. Even the colors that denote powerful emotions vary. Love is symbolized by green in Japan, red and purple in China, Korea, Japan and the USA. Unluckiness is symbolized by red in Chad, Nigeria and Germany. Luckiness is symbolized by red in China, Denmark and Argentina. The traditional bridal color is red in China and white in the USA. Ambition and desire are symbolized by red in India.&lt;ref name=Asiam/&gt;

== Color symbolism in Arabic culture ==
Color has different meanings in different countries.¬† We can specifically look at the Arabic culture and take it into consideration. We can start with the color white. In the Arabic culture, white is thought of as the color that is symbolic for nature.¬† Since it related with nature, it has a meaning that is one of positivity. It also relates with that of being clean and pure.¬† White is a color that is commonly worn during prayers and with that, it symbolizes purity. White‚Äôs positive connotation carries out into other aspects.¬† It is also used as a symbol for positivity in the future. White is also used to symbolize the end of war. You will also see women adorn white at their weddings as a sign of positivity.¬† Since doves are white, they share the symbolic meaning that comes with the color.¬† This in turn causes them to be associated with positivity of good news. 

When you look at the color Black in Arabic culture you can find that it is related to funerals and death. Women will often wear black to funerals in order to show that they are sad for those who have passed. ¬†Also relating to death, black is associated with hell. Black is also used to symbolize dark.¬† Hell is thought to be a dark black place associating black as negative. ¬†Black in general is looked at as having negative connotations around it. For example, the symbolism of a black heart refers to someone who is unkind.¬† 
[[File:Red rose with black background.jpg|thumb]]
Green is a color that is commonly found in Islam.¬† It is a color found in nature and with this, it is associated with and represents goodness. Green is a color that has an overall positive meaning. ¬† The color green also has to do with truthfulness, again going with positivity.¬† If you look at phrases, the symbolic meanings are generally positive.¬† If you look at the phrase green hand, it relates to being generous which is a positive thing. 

Red has an overall positive association with it. Often you will find that red is a color associated with roses and blood.¬† The color red has to do with love and passion.¬† In sayings you can find it to have either a negative or positive meaning such as the term red eye relates with anger.¬† The Arabic culture also associates this color with death.

Blue is related with positivity when discussing it with nature, otherwise it can be related with negative connotations. When used in the phrase blue eyes, it refers to jealousy. A blue body relates with death and therefore is associated with negativity.

Yellow is another color that is also associated with nature and the sun.¬† Again, since it is a color related with nature, it takes on the symbolic meaning of positivity.¬† Gold is also categorized under here and is also takes on a positive meaning. ¬†Generally, when used in phrases, the color yellow has to do with negativity.¬† For example, a yellow smile means to be mean.

==Colors and emotions==
[[File:Emotions - 3.png|thumb]]
Color symbolism is displayed in many ways. One of the most common ways we see color symbolism displayed in through our emotions. In this article Color-emotions associations: Past experience and personal preference it takes a look at how we connect colors with our emotions and how it depends on a person‚Äôs preference and or their past experiences. 
	This article first starts out by talking about the different colors and what they are associated with. The first color it talks about is the color blue and how people see blue as comfort and security and how they see orange as being upsetting. The next one they talk about is yellow which is more of a happy color compared to purple which they say is dignified but I have never heard of purple being seen that way. The next one this article talks about which I find very interesting is the color red. People view the color red in two different ways, one being as a strong and passionate color. However, it is also seen in a very different way, people see it as an aggressive color because it is the color of blood. The last color this article talks about is the color green and how just like red it has two different views. Green can be viewed positively as in quietness but can also be viewed negatively as in guilt. 
	This study took a look at how we associate colors with emotions. This study was done and showed that we associated lighter colors such as blue or yellow with more positive emotions. It then showed how we associated darker colors such as grey or black with more native emotions. However, something very interesting that this study did find is that most young prefer the color black over many other colors. 
	The study was done with college aged students to see how they associate their emotions with colors. Many tests were done such as matching tasks and matching color tests to see what colors they associate with their emotions. The study had 44 men and 54 women in it and they again were all college students. They identified a color sample with one emotion only and it showed what emotional response is connected to a color. 
	The results from this study did find that people mostly associate the color green with being the most positive. Over 95% off people said that green s the most positive because it makes them feel relaxed and then comfortable and at peace. It also showed that people saw yellow as the more excited and energetic emotion, with over 90% agreeing with this. 79% of students found that blue was a calming color because it reminded them of the ocean which is known as a calming place. People did have different answers when it came to red because like explained earlier, red is seen in two very different ways, It has been seen as love by many but also as evil because it remind people of blood. Many people did not seem to like the color purple very much as it was not favored by many for their preferences. The color black was seen to be more negative emotions like fear and depression. Overall, this article shows how color can be important because it is how people associate their emotions and things based on color symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Kaya &amp; H., Naz &amp; Helen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7672">{{canon law}}
The '''canon law of contract''' follows that of the civil jurisdiction in which [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] operates. (Latin ''contractus''; Old French ''contract''; Modern French ''contrat''; Italian ''contratto'').

=="Canonization" of civil contract jurisprudence==
{{see also|1983 Code of Canon Law|Contract|Law of obligations}}
Sometimes canon law makes the civil law (the law of civil society) its own, giving it the same effect in canon law as if it had actually been promulgated by canonical leglislators, subject to the ''proviso'' that such civil law does not contravene divine law.&lt;ref name=Coriden38&gt;Coriden, ''A Text and Commentary'', pg. 38 (commentary on Canon 22).&lt;/ref&gt; This should be considered more than "a mere recognition" of secular law; such secular law "is made into canon law."&lt;ref name=Coriden38/&gt;

Contract law is an area of civil jurisprudence which the [[1983 Code of Canon Law|1983 Code]] "canonizes".&lt;ref name=Coriden38/&gt; If a contract is valid in civil law, it is valid in canon law also.&lt;ref name=Coriden38/&gt; If a contract is rendered invalid by civil law, it is thereby rendered invalid in canon law as well.&lt;ref name=Coriden38/&gt;
{{quote|Canon 1290: Without prejudice to Can. 1547, whatever the local civil law decrees about contracts, both generally and specifically, and about the voiding of contracts, is to be observed regarding goods which are subject to the power of governance of the Church, and with the same effect, provided that the civil law is not contrary to divine law, and that canon law does not provide otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P4Q.HTM Canon 1290], 1983 Code of Canon Law (Intratext), accessed 4/16/2016, released under https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Prior to the [[1917 Code of Canon Law|1917 Code]], canon law required that the [[Roman law]] of obligations be observed when ecclesiastical moral persons (termed "[[person (canon law)|juridic persons]]" in the [[1983 Code of Canon Law|1983 Code]], except for the [[Holy See]] and the [[Catholic Church]] as such&lt;ref&gt;Coriden, ''A Text and Commentary'', pg. 80 (commentary on Canon 113 ¬ß1).&lt;/ref&gt;) entered into contracts.&lt;ref name=Coriden878/&gt; Canon 1529 of the 1917 Code made a shift regarding contract law, recognizing the civil law binding in the particular territory in which a contract was made as binding in canon law as well (with certain exceptions).&lt;ref name=Coriden878&gt;Coriden, ''A Text and Commentary'', pg. 878 (commentary on Canon 1290).&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal capacity of [[person (canon law)|physical and juridic persons]] to contract comes from canon law itself, however, and not from civil law,&lt;ref name=Coriden878/&gt; even though the provisions of the civil contract law are observed in canon law with the same effects.&lt;ref name=Coriden878/&gt;

Canon law, therefore, cannot be said to have a universal contractual law.&lt;ref name=Coriden878/&gt;

==Roman origins and moralist doctrine==
{{main|Roman law}}
The canonical and moralist doctrine on this subject is a development of that contained in the Roman civil law. In [[Roman law]] a mere agreement between two parties to give, do, or refrain from doing something was a nude pact (''pactum nudum'') which gave rise to no civil obligation, and no action lay to enforce it. It needed to be clothed in some investitive fact which the law recognized in order to give rise to a civil obligation which should be enforced at law. Not that the nude pact was considered to be destitute of all binding force; it gave rise to a natural obligation, and it might afford ground for a legal exception. A man of honour would keep his engagements even if he knew that the law could not be invoked to compel him to do so. Moral theology, being the science of Christian conduct, could not be satisfied with the mere legal view of the effect of an agreement. If the agreement had all other requisites for a valid contract, moral theology must necessarily consider it to be binding, even though it was a nude pact and could not be enforced in the courts of law. Canon law made this moral attitude its own. In the ''[[Decretals of Gregory IX]]'' it is expressly laid down that pacts, however nude, must be kept, and that a strenuous endeavour must be made to put in execution what one has promised. It thus came to pass that nude pacts could be enforced in the Christian courts, and the Church's legislation served eventually to break down the rigid formalism of Roman law, and to prepare the way for the more equitable law of contract which all Christian nations now possess.

In the canonical and moral doctrine there is hardly room for the distinction between a nude pact, or mere agreement, and a contract. The Roman jurist's definition of the former is frequently used by canonists to define contract. They say that a contract is the consent of two or more persons to the same proposal; or, bringing out a little more definitely the effect and object of a contract, they define it to be an agreement by which two or more persons mutually bind themselves to give, do, or abstain from something. 

From the moralist's point of view, then, every agreement seriously entered into by those who are capable of contracting with reference to some lawful object is a contract, whether such agreement can be enforced in the civil courts or not. The intention of the parties is looked at, and if they seriously intended to bind themselves, there is a contractual relation between them.

==Morally-binding force of legally null contracts==
{{see also|Internal forum|Communitas Perfecta}}
This doctrine, however, gives rise to a question of some importance. The Church fully admits and defends the right of the State to make laws for the temporal well-being of its citizens. All States require certain formalities for the validity of certain actions. Last wills and testaments are a familiar example, and although they are not strictly contracts, yet the principle is the same and they will serve for an example of what is meant. A deed, the only formal contract of English law, is another example. 

A will destitute of the requisite formalities is null and void at law; but what is the effect of such a voiding law in the forum of conscience? This question has been much debated among moralists. 

Some have maintained that such a law is binding in the [[internal forum|internal]] as well as in the [[external forum]], so that a formal contract, destitute of the formalities required by law, is null and void in conscience as it is in law. 

Others adopted the contrary opinion, and held that the want of formality only affected the external forum of civil law, and left intact the natural obligation arising from a contract. 

The common opinion takes a middle course. It holds that the want of formality, though it makes the contract void in the eyes of the law, renders it only voidable in the forum of conscience; so that, until one of the parties moves to set the contract aside, it remains valid, and anyone deriving benefit under it may enjoy his benefit in peace. If, however, the party interested moves to set it aside, and does so effectively by having recourse to the court of law if necessary, both must then abide by the law which makes the contract void and of no effect.

==Plot==
After being murdered, Makina Hoshimura turns into a living "Shikabane Hime" ("Corpse Princess"). Armed with dual MAC-11 submachine guns, she must kill 108 other Shikabane in order to gain entry into heaven. She is assisted in this task by Keisei Tagami, a Buddhist monk with links to an anti-corpse group known as the K≈çgon Sect. Her ultimate goal is to avenge the death of her family, by destroying the Shikabane known as the Seven Stars.

:{{anime voices|Nana Akiyama|[[Luci Christian]]}}
:Makina is the [[main protagonist]] and titular "living corpse". She is tasked with killing 108 corpses to gain entrance to heaven. She has formidable physical skills and her weapon of choice are two [[MAC-11|Ingram MAC-11]] submachine guns. Her Contracted Monk was Keisei Tagami. Later in the story, it is revealed that her family discovered the process of making a Shikabane Hime and was killed by the Seven Stars whom made Makina into a Shikabane. Later on, after Keisei's death, Ouri became her new Contracted Monk, although she refused to accept him at first.

:A normal high school boy who was raised at Keisei Tagami's temple. He treats Keisei as his brother even though they are not blood related. Ouri is able to appear where the Shikabane are because of a mysterious black cat who began to talk to him. After the second time talking to the cat, Ouri knew that when he saw the cat he had to follow it, leading him to the corpses. He has also been nicknamed by the children at the temple "Hanagami". Later on after Keisei's death, he became Makina's new Contracted Monk. In the anime, it is strongly implied that he is in love with Makina.

:Keisei Tagami was a Buddhist priest under the anti-corpse organization known as the K≈çugon Sect. He found Ouri Kagami as a three-year-old child and raised him at his temple orphanage. Keisei was an orphan himself, raised by Makina Hoshimura's father. When the Hoshimura family was brutally murdered, he agreed to become Makina's Contracted Monk. He was something of a pervert, often offering (or forcing upon) Ouri sexual posters or skin mags. He died near the end of the first season.

==Terminology==
;Shikabane
:Sometimes referred to as corpses.  When a person dies with a powerful regret or obsession, they may become a Shikabane.  As a Shikabane, they are undead but retain some degree of memory and intelligence.  Their appearance may also differ greatly from that of a human.  Shikabane are given superhuman strength and a unique ability or attribute called a curse. Shikabane have no feeling towards the living and tend to kill them as driven by their regret or obsession.  A Shikabane can be killed by destroying or otherwise severing their brains.

;Shikabane Hime
:Shikabane Hime are Shikabane that follow the K≈çgon Sect.  So far only girls of a certain age group can become a Shikabane Hime.  Each of them is partnered with a monk, who provides them with life energy called Rune.  In exchange, the Shikabane Hime act as shields for their monk.  They are used to hunt and kill rogue Shikabane. In fact, once they kill 108 Shikabane, they receive the reward of going to Heaven (this number may be from the number of sins in Buddhism).  Shikabane Hime keep their human form but do still have their own curses that occasionally manifest, and unlike rogue Shikabane, Shikabane Hime are not driven by their regrets or obsessions to the same degree of madness.  If their partner monk dies and a replacement is not forthcoming, however, the Shikabane Hime usually die or become Shikabane.  Despite their contribution to the fight against the rogue Shikabane, they are shunned by most of the K≈çgon Sect followers due to their nature as Shikabane.

;Contracted Monk
:Contracted Monks are the partner monks of the Shikabane Hime.  They usually provide their Shikabane Hime with support and are linked by a bond.

;Curse
:A curse is a unique power that a Shikabane possess.  Generally, it has something to do with their obsession or regret.

;Investigator
:A monk who acts as support for Contracted Monks.  They usually do not have a contract of their own.

'''''Double Dare''''' is an American television [[game show]] on which two teams compete to win cash and prizes by answering trivia questions and completing messy stunts known as physical challenges. It originally ran from 1986 to 1993. A revival ran in 2000, and a new revival began on June 25, 2018.

Hosted by [[Marc Summers]], the program originally premiered on [[Nickelodeon]] on October 6, 1986, as its first game show. The series saw many adjustments in scheduling and titling throughout its run. Almost immediately after its debut, ''Double Dare'' had more than tripled viewership for Nickelodeon‚Äôs afternoon lineup, becoming the most-watched original daily program on [[cable television]]. The program was a major success for Nickelodeon, helping to establish the network as a major player in cable television, and to revitalize the genre of game shows for children. ''Double Dare'' remains Nickelodeon's longest-running game show. In January 2001, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked the show number 29 on its list of 50 Greatest Game Shows.

A continuation for [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] premiered on February 22, 1988, later revamped as ''Super Sloppy Double Dare'' on January 22, 1989. The program also had a short run on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] as ''Family Double Dare'', airing from April 3 to July 23, 1988. Nickelodeon continued ''Family Double Dare'', premiering a new version on October 6, 1990. The original series ended on February 6, 1993. The series was revived, hosted by [[Jason Harris Katz|Jason Harris]], and titled ''Double Dare 2000''; this aired from January 22 to November 10, 2000. A second revival of the series, hosted by [[Liza Koshy]] and featuring Marc Summers, premiered on June 25, 2018.

==Gameplay==

===Main game===
Each team on the original ''Double Dare'' and ''Super Sloppy Double Dare'' consisted of two children, while teams on ''Family Double Dare'' and ''Double Dare 2000'' included two adults and two children.&lt;ref name="DD2k"/&gt; Originally, both teams wore red uniforms, but after ''Double Dare'' entered syndication in 1988, one team wore blue uniforms while the other wore red.&lt;ref name="86 episode"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FDD"/&gt;

Each round begins with a toss-up physical challenge in which both teams compete, with the winning team receiving both initial control of the round, and money for their score. After the toss-up, the host begins asking trivia questions of the team in control. Each correct answer earns a monetary award, and allows the team to maintain control, while an incorrect answer, or failure to respond within approximately ten seconds turns control over to the opponents. However, the team can dare their opponents to answer the question, doubling its value; in response, the opponents can double dare for quadruple the original value. When the team in control is challenged to a double dare, they have to either answer or compete in a physical challenge. An incorrect answer, or not responding within approximately five seconds on a dare or double dare, awards both control and the appropriate amount of money to the team that issues it. The second round plays the same as the first, with question values doubled.&lt;ref name="86 episode"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Prosecutors vs. Mad Avengers|series=Double Dare|network=Nickelodeon|date=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EOTGS"/&gt;&lt;ref name=collins/&gt; On the original ''Double Dare'' and ''Super Sloppy Double Dare'', a question was initially worth $10. On ''Family Double Dare'' and ''Double Dare 2000'', a question was initially worth $25. On the 2018 ''Double Dare'', a question is initially worth $50.&lt;ref name="86 episode"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FDD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DD2k premiere"&gt;{{cite episode|series=Double Dare 2000|title=100 Deeds for Eddie McDowd vs. The Amanda Show|network=Nickelodeon|date=January 22, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="18 premiere"&gt;{{cite episode|series=Double Dare|title=The Mad Dogs vs. Line Drive 25|network=Nickelodeon|date=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the toss-up at the start of the first round, the host explains the rules as follows:

{{cquote|I'm going to ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, or think the other team hasn't got a clue, you can dare them to answer it for double the dollars. But, be careful, because they can always double dare you back for four times the amount, and then you either have to answer that question or take the physical challenge.&lt;ref name="FDD"&gt;{{cite episode|title=McGoldrick vs. O'Donnell|series=Family Double Dare|network=Fox|date=April 3, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="18 premiere"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Wildcats vs. Mighty Midgets|series=Double Dare|network=Nickelodeon|date=February 13, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1992 show"&gt;{{cite episode|series=NBA All-Star Double Dare|network=Nickelodeon|date=February 8, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Physical challenges===
[[File:Family Double Dare spaghetti challenge.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A 1990 ''Family Double Dare'' toss-up physical challenge showing two contestants trying to catch a "meatball" in a bowl of "spaghetti."]]
Physical challenges are often messy stunts&lt;ref name="DD2k"/&gt; that a team has to perform in a specified time, usually 20 or 30 seconds, although occasionally 10 or 15 seconds. All physical challenges on ''Double Dare 2000'' were 30 seconds in length, unless a time reduction was in play due to the Triple Dare Challenge. The team wins money and retained control for completing the stunt. Otherwise, the money and control pass to their opponents.&lt;ref name="EOTGS"/&gt;

Many challenges have involved filling a container past a line with one of a variety of substances including water, uncooked rice, green slime, whipped cream, and milk. Others involve catching a specific number of items before time runs out. For example, during "Pies in the Pants," a contestant has to catch a set number of pies in a pair of oversized clown pants within the specified time limit, while their teammate launches the pies from a foot-operated catapult at the opposite end of the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=King |first=Susan |title=Marc Summers: Kidding Around, Seriously |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-25/news/tv-1666_1_marc-summers |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=April 10, 2017 |date=August 25, 1991 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170411140547/http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-25/news/tv-1666_1_marc-summers |archivedate=April 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the original ''Double Dare'' and ''Super Sloppy Double Dare'', both contestants on a team competed in all physical challenges. For the 1988 version of ''Family Double Dare'', all four members of a team competed in the challenges. On the 1990‚Äì93 version of ''Family Double Dare'' and on ''Double Dare 2000'', two members of a team competed in round one, and all four members competed in round two. All members of a team competed in physical challenges on the 2018 ''Double Dare''.&lt;ref name="86 episode"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FDD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DD2k premiere"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1992 show"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Triplets"&gt;{{cite episode|series=Double Dare|title=Team Triple Threat vs. Wonder Triplet Power|network=Nickelodeon|date=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Double Dare 2000'' introduced the Triple Dare Challenge. Available only in round two, this allowed a team to make their physical challenge more difficult, increasing its value by $100, and putting a bonus prize at stake. Difficulties included reducing the time limit, adding an extra item to the stunt, or increasing the overall difficulty of the stunt. The actual modifier was not revealed unless the team decided to accept the challenge. If the team did not complete the challenge successfully, the money, prize, and control went to their opponents.&lt;ref name="DD2k"/&gt;

===Obstacle course===
[[File:Double Dare - Obstacle Course - Slide (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Sundae Slide being prepared on a 1987 ''Double Dare'' obstacle course.]]
The team with the highest score at the end of round two goes on to the bonus round, the [[obstacle course]] (renamed the Slopstacle Course for ''Double Dare 2000''). From the original ''Double Dare'' through ''Double Dare 2000'' both teams keep all money earned, regardless of the outcome.&lt;ref name="1992 show"/&gt; Only the winning team on the 2018 version gets to keep their money.&lt;ref name="18 premiere"/&gt; 

The course consists of eight obstacles which have to be completed within 60 seconds. Each obstacle has an orange flag either at its end or hidden within it. One team member runs the first obstacle, then passes its flag to a partner, who then moves on to the next obstacle. The team continues to alternate in this manner until they have completed the course or until time expires.&lt;ref name="EOTGS"/&gt; For safety reasons, team members are given helmets, elbow pads, and knee pads to wear while running the course.&lt;ref name=Boys/&gt;

Many obstacles have appeared in the course rotation, often based on body parts, food, and enlarged items found in daily life.&lt;ref name=Floss&gt;{{cite web|title=The 10 Slimiest Stunts of Double Dare |publisher=[[Mental Floss]] |last=Rossen |first=Jake |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/67581/no-small-splatter-10-slimiest-stunts-double-dare |date=August 20, 2015 |accessdate=March 8, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309061028/http://mentalfloss.com/article/67581/no-small-splatter-10-slimiest-stunts-double-dare |archivedate=March 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular elements of the obstacle course have included The One-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, an oversized [[hamster wheel]]; Pick It, a giant [[human nose]] with a flag hidden inside; The Sundae Slide, a chocolate-covered ramp leading to a [[playground slide]] with [[ice cream]] at the bottom; and Gum Drop, which required contestants to leap into a giant [[gumball machine]] filled with plastic balls and slide out through the dispensing hatch at the bottom.&lt;ref name=Floss/&gt;&lt;ref name="AV Club"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eakin|first=Marah|title="It smelled like death": An oral history of the Double Dare obstacle course|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/it-smelled-death-oral-history-double-dare-obstacle-245939|work=[[The A.V.

The team wins a prize for each obstacle completed, escalating in value up to a grand prize for completing the entire course.&lt;ref name="EOTGS"/&gt; Two-person teams split the cash earnings, and both contestants receive the same prize for each obstacle. Prizes have included televisions, concert tickets, encyclopedias, electronics, gift certificates, non-motorized modes of transportation and, on the Fox ''Family Double Dare'', cash.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt; On the original and ''Super Sloppy'' versions, the grand prize was usually a vacation or an experience at [[United States Space Camp|Space Camp]]. All eight prizes were usually worth a total of between $3,000 and $4,000, with some episodes featuring a prize package nearing $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Screaming Meatballs vs. Shamalama Ding Dongs|series=Double Dare|network=Syndication|date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the Fox ''Family Double Dare'', as well as the first season of the Nickelodeon run, the grand prize was a vehicle, making all eight prizes worth between $15,000 and $25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hinman |first=Catherine |title=Family Ties?

[[Image:Marc Summers 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Marc Summers hosted ''Double Dare'' from 1986 to 1993.]]
In the mid-1980s, [[Nickelodeon]] was approached by production and consulting groups with the idea of doing a game show for children, a first for the network.&lt;ref name=Thrillist&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Barry|title=An Oral History of Nickelodeon's Double Dare|url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/an-oral-history-of-nickelodeons-double-dare|work=[[Thrillist Media Group|Thrillist]]|accessdate=March 7, 2017|date=October 7, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120230713/https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/an-oral-history-of-nickelodeons-double-dare |archivedate=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nickelodeon conducted focus groups and concluded that children enjoyed watching game shows with adults, but they did not have a game show targeted at their demographic.&lt;ref name=Boys/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherwood/&gt;&lt;ref name=Indie&gt;{{cite web|last=Schenider |first=Michael |title=Double Dare Reunion: The Secrets Behind the Nickelodeon Series‚Äô Unlikely Origins ‚Äì and Potential Rebirth |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/11/double-dare-nickelodeon-marc-summers-reunion-1201749512/ |work=[[IndieWire]] |accessdate=March 6, 2017 |date=November 23, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307210357/http://www.indiewire.com/2016/11/double-dare-nickelodeon-marc-summers-reunion-1201749512/ |archivedate=March 7, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dee LaDuke, Robert Mittenthal, Michael Klinghoffer, and Geoffrey Darby worked to develop a new format, basing it on a combination of trivia, [[Truth or dare?|truth or dare]], and the board game [[Mouse Trap (game)|Mouse Trap]].&lt;ref name=Thrillist/&gt; The [[Television pilot|pilot]] presentation was recorded in May 1986, hosted by Darby.&lt;ref name="AV Club"/&gt; ''Double Dare'' was [[green-light]]ed and announced in June 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Burgeoning world of cable programming|journal=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable|Broadcasting]]|date=June 16, 1986|publisher=[[NewBay Media]]|page=10|via=American Radio History|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1986/BC-1986-06-16.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial candidates to host the program included [[Soupy Sales]], host of children's [[variety show]]s in the 1950s and 1960s, and comedian [[Dana Carvey]]. After Nickelodeon determined Sales to be too old for the role, and Carvey was offered a chance to audition for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', the search for a host continued. Producers viewed over 1,000 applicants from [[New York City|New York]] or [[Los Angeles]].

James Fenhagen and Byron Taylor created the original stage design for ''Double Dare.'' The design for the original series' set was inspired by a 1980s Italian postmodern design and architecture group known as the [[Memphis Group]]. Glass brick walls and yellow and pink, often in a [[checkerboard]] pattern, were prominent aspects of the set design. Highlighted by blue and yellow tile-style floors, Geoffrey Darby gave the direction for the set to look like a ''[[natatorium]]'' (swimming pool), while Robert Mittenthal feels its inspiration is derived from a [[bathroom]].&lt;ref name="AV Club"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Slimed"&gt;{{cite book|last=Klickstein|first=Matthew|date=September 24, 2013|title=Slimed!: An Oral History of Nickelodeon‚Äôs Golden Age|publisher=[[Plume (publisher)|Plume]]|author-link=Mathew Klickstein|isbn=0142196851}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the original ''Double Dare'' music was composed by [[Edd Kalehoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About |work=[[Edd Kalehoff]] Music |url=http://www.eddkalehoff.com/about |accessdate=March 11, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312071548/http://www.eddkalehoff.com/about |archivedate=March 12, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production originated at the studios of [[PBS]] affiliate [[WHYY-TV]] in Philadelphia, [[Pennsylvania]]. WHYY offered Nickelodeon their newly opened production wing to use, and Nickelodeon felt Philadelphia was a better location to initially produce ''Double Dare'' because of its lower production costs, instead of cities like New York or Los Angeles where national television production is more common.&lt;ref name=Thrillist/&gt;&lt;ref name=Indie/&gt; The 65-episode first season was recorded in a 23-day period beginning September 18, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shister|first=Gale|date=September 19, 1986|title=Kids game show being taped here|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|via =[[Ancestry.com#Newspapers.com|Newspapers.com]]|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10683213/kids_game_show_being_taped_here/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Double Dare'' premiered on Nickelodeon on October 6, 1986.

In July 1987, pilots hosted by [[Caitlyn Jenner|Bruce Jenner]] were produced by [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] for two possible versions of ''Double Dare'' with adult players: one pairing celebrities with contestants, and another with married couples.

A 13-episode Saturday night edition titled ''Family Double Dare'' aired on Fox from April 3 to July 23, 1988.

''Double Dare'' revitalized interest in the concept of a game show for children.&lt;ref name="DD2k"/&gt; Less than a year after the program launched, [[NBC]] had premiered ''[[I'm Telling!]]'',&lt;ref name=collins/&gt; [[Lorimar Television]] had announced plans for ''[[Fun House (U.S. game show)|Fun House]]'', and Nickelodeon's ''[[Finders Keepers (U.S. game show)|Finders Keepers]]'' began airing&amp;mdash;all shows based on competition between teams of children.&lt;ref name=Sherwood&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherwood |first1=Rick |title=A Kids' Show That Dared to Be Different |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-24/entertainment/ca-30884_1_game-show |accessdate=March 6, 2017 |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 24, 1987 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308044612/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-24/entertainment/ca-30884_1_game-show |archivedate=March 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During ''Double Dare''{{'}}s first year on television, junior versions of established game shows including ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' and ''[[The Cross-Wits]]'' were developed for syndication, but ultimately were not produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|date=November 23, 1987|title=Slide in children's animation viewing spurring live syndicated productions|magazine=[[Television/Radio Age (magazine)|Television/Radio Age]]|last=Sobel|first=Robert|page=58|via=American Radio History|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-TV-Radio-Age/Issues/80s/1987/1987-11-23-RTVA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game show executive and producer Bob Boden noted that ''Double Dare'' "allowed kids to get dirty and have a good time in ways that really were not acceptable before that show".&lt;ref name="Fantasy"/&gt; ''Double Dare'' remains the longest-running game show produced by Nickelodeon.&lt;ref name=Splat/&gt;

As ''Double Dare'' grew messier, a green slime substance became more commonly used in physical challenges and obstacles. Slime was originally introduced on another Nickelodeon program, ''[[You Can't Do That on Television]]''. ''Double Dare'''s high viewership led to greater visibility for Nickelodeon's association with slime, and saw it featured in promotions for the network in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=Thrillist/&gt; The substance proliferated further, including annual slimings on the [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards|Kids' Choice Awards]], a slime [[geyser]] at Nickelodeon Studios, and slime-based segments on other game shows including ''Wild &amp; Crazy Kids'' and ''[[Figure It Out]]''. The relationship of Nickelodeon and slime still lasts on the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|date=May 31, 2016|title=A Brief History of Nickelodeon Slime|medium=Video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpgWpXWJZmQ|access-date=July 6, 2017|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[NickSplat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===

Reviews of the show were often favorable, noting it was fun entertainment for the family. After ''Double Dare'' premiered, Kenneth R. Clark, media writer for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', observed that when contestants "squeal and make faces, it is somehow natural, wholesome and infectious," and said, "''Double Dare'' is so refreshing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|page=4|title=Goo, glop, ick: It's all a game on Nickelodeon|work=[[Chicago Tribune]] TV Week|first=Kenneth R.|last=Clark|date=October 26, 1986|via=[[Ancestry.com#Newspapers.com|Newspapers.com]]|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10684493/goo_glop_ick_its_all_a_game_on/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noel Holston of the ''[[Star Tribune|Minneapolis Star and Tribune]]'' wrote that "kids and game shows, when you think about it, go together like hot fudge and ice cream".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holston|first=Noel|page=1-C|title=Nickelodeon's 'Double Dare' is a game show strictly for kids|work=[[Star Tribune|Minneapolis Star and Tribune]]|date=October 21, 1986|via=[[Ancestry.com#Newspapers.com|Newspapers.com]]|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10684612/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Orange County Register]]''{{'}}s Ellen T.

Some criticism came from the feeling that the program was not educational.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PBS To Unveil Geography Game Show Based on Popular Computer Character|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1991/09/25/04pbs.h11.html|work=[[Education Week]]|accessdate=March 6, 2017|date=September 25, 1991|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308044335/http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1991/09/25/04pbs.h11.html|archivedate=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others were concerned about [[food waste]] like beans and eggs in physical challenges and obstacles.&lt;ref name=Thrillist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|page=C-4|title=Reader dares a boycott of 'Double Dare'|work=[[Pittsburgh Press]]|date=May 2, 1988|via=[[Ancestry.com#Newspapers.com|Newspapers.com]]|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10684873/}}{{free access}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In a "Cheers and Jeers" section in 1988, ''[[TV Guide]]'' gave "jeers" to ''Double Dare'' for "daring to push beyond the limits of good taste," saying it was "gross and insulting to watch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Cheers 'N' Jeers|magazine=[[TV Guide]]|date=June 25, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, television and film critic [[Jeffrey Lyons]] wrote that he "wouldn't dream of proclaiming that ''Super Sloppy Double Dare'' is good for your child.

In an interview with [[AfterBuzz TV]], he said that he felt the length of the Triple Dare Challenge took away from the game and that "if we would have done it the way we originally did it, we would have been fine, but unfortunately, it didn't happen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Fyffe, Emma |date=July 21, 2016 |title=Marc Summers (Double Dare) at San Diego Comic-Con 2016 |medium=Video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOm8EjbgtjQ |access-date=April 5, 2017 |time=5:15 |publisher=[[AfterBuzz TV]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410193616/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOm8EjbgtjQ |archivedate=April 10, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 revival of ''Double Dare'' premiered to positive reviews, particularly for host Liza Koshy. Reality Blurred's [[Andy Dehnart]] said that the reboot "did an excellent job of balancing the old and new," and praised the combination of Koshy and Marc Summers, saying she "can absolutely hold her own as host," and "her rapport with [Summers] felt natural and playful."&lt;ref name="Dehnart"/&gt; Joel Keller of the ''[[New York Post]]'''s Decider observed that "the show belongs to Koshy, who ad libs well and makes the kids feel at ease," and gave ''Double Dare'' a favorable "[[Streaming media|stream]] it" rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stream It Or Skip It: ‚ÄòDouble Dare,‚Äô Your Favorite Sloppy Game Show From The ‚Äò80s, Is Back On Nickelodeon  |last=Keller |first=Joel |url=https://decider.com/2018/06/26/double-dare-on-nickelodeon-stream-it-or-skip-it/ |work=Decider |date=June 26, 2018 |accessdate=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Double Dare'' has been featured in a number of notable visual media since its premiere, often with one or more characters participating as contestants in homages to the series. On "Double Dare", a 2016 episode of the 1980s-set sitcom ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'', Adam Goldberg ([[Sean Giambrone]]) tries to find the perfect partner to audition to be a contestant on ''Double Dare''. After rejecting his friend Emmy Mirsky (Stephanie Katherine Grant), he eventually runs through a mock obstacle course at a tryout with his grandfather Albert "Pops" Solomon ([[George Segal]]).

''Double Dare'' has also been subject to parodies and spoofs in various forms. The October 1988 issue of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]''  has a spoof of ''Double Dare'' called "Double Damp". Marc Summers and Harvey are lampooned as "Muck Slummers" and "Hardly". The piece mocked the program's use of food products, the dangerous nature of some stunts, and the similarity to game show ''[[Beat the Clock]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=DeBartolo|first1=Dick|last2=Torres|first2=Angelo|date=October 1988|title=Double Damp|magazine=Mad|publisher=[[EC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Summers and Harvey consider being parodied in ''Mad'' a high point in their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Marc |url=http://www.marcsummerstv.com/about-marc/ |publisher=Marc Summers Productions |accessdate=April 7, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408082209/http://www.marcsummerstv.com/about-marc/ |archivedate=April 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spivack|first1=Emily|title=Worn Stories|date=August 26, 2014|publisher=[[Princeton Architectural Press]]|isbn=1616892765|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 episode of the [[truTV]] sketch comedy series ''[[Friends of the People]]'' titled "Double Dare" guest stars Marc Summers as himself, hosting "banned" moments from ''Double Dare''.

'''El Mirador''' (which translates as "the lookout", "the viewpoint", or "the belvedere") is a large [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] settlement, located in the north of the modern [[Departments of Guatemala|department]] of [[El Pet√©n]], [[Guatemala]].

==Discovery==
El Mirador was first discovered in 1926, and was photographed from the air in 1930, but the remote site deep in the jungle had little attention paid to it until Ian Graham spent some time there making the first map of the area in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/El-Mirador-the-Lost-City-of-the-Maya.html?c=y&amp;page=3|title=El Mirador, the Lost City of the Maya|website=Smithsonianmag.com|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A detailed investigation was begun in 1978 with an archaeological project under the direction of [[Bruce Dahlin]] ([[The Catholic University of America]]) and [[Ray Matheny]] ([[Brigham Young University]]). Dahlin's work focused primarily on the bajo swamps and mapping, while Matheny's team focused primarily on excavations in the site center and architecture. This project ended in 1983. To the surprise of the [[archaeologist]]s, it was found that a large amount of construction was not contemporary with the large Maya classic cities in the area, like [[Tikal]] and [[Uaxactun]], but rather from centuries earlier in the pre-classic era (''see:'' [[Mesoamerican chronology]]).&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sources of Obsidian from El Mirador, Guatemala: New Evidence on [[Preclassic Maya]] Interaction |pages=158‚Äì168 |author1=William R.

In 2003, [[Richard D. Hansen]], a Senior Scientist from [[Idaho State University]], initiated major investigation, stabilization, and conservation programs at El Mirador with a multi-disciplinary approach, including staff and technical personnel from 52 universities and research institutions from throughout the world. By August 2008, the team had published 168 scientific papers,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.miradorbasin.com/about/rhansen.php Mirador Basin Project, The Cradle of Maya Civilization, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and produced many technical reports and scientific presentations as well as documentary films in the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]], [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]], the [[Learning Channel]], [[BBC]],  [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]] and [[Good Morning America]],  [[60 Minutes]] (Australia), and the [[Discovery Channel]].

==History==

El Mirador flourished from about the 6th century BCE  to the 1st century CE, reaching its height from the 3rd century BCE. Then it experienced a hiatus of construction and perhaps abandonment for generations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mesoweb.com/publications/MMS/14_Suyuc-Hansen.pdf|title=El complejo piramidal La Danta: ejemplo del auge en El Mirador|last=Suyuc Ley|first=Edgar|last2=Hansen|first2=Richard D.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by re-occupation and further construction in the Late Classic era, and a final abandonment about the end of the 9th century. The civic center of the site covers some {{convert|10|sqmi|km2}} with several thousand structures, including monumental architecture from 10 to 72 meters high.

One of the key elements for this tremendous rise in human population was the many bajos, seasonal swamps, in the region. Tropical-forest soil contains hardly any nutrients and most of the nutrients present get washed away by rain. Yet the Maya developed a system that was highly productive. In the Mirador basin, the swamps provided the solution. By importing mud from the swamps by the thousands of tonnes, the Maya created mud-covered terraces ready for agriculture. By adding lime to the soil, they elevated the pH, making it suitable for a variety of crops: corn, squash, beans, cacao, cotton and palm. When the ground was depleted of nutrients, adding another layer of mud reinvigorates the fields.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite video | people = Richard Hansen  | title = The Origins &amp; Collapse of the Preclassic Maya in the Mirador Basin, Guatemala  | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE8BNer2H3k  | medium = Flash | date = April 2, 2014  | accessdate = February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a number of [[Triadic pyramid|"triadic" structures]] (around 35 structures),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asociaciontikal.com/pdf/13_-_Morales_et_al.07.pdf|format=PDF|title=''NUEVAS PERSPECTIVAS EN LOS MODELOS DE ASENTAMIENTO MAYA DURANTE EL PRECL√ÅSICO EN LAS TIERRAS BAJAS: LOS SITIOS DE NAKBE Y EL MIRADOR, XXI Simposio de Investigaciones Arequeologicas en Guatemala''|website=Asociaciontikal.com|accessdate=2016-10-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515181633/http://asociaciontikal.com/pdf/13_-_Morales_et_al.07.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of large artificial platforms topped with a set of 3 summit pyramids. The most notable of such structures are three huge complexes; one is nicknamed "[[El Tigre (pyramid)|El Tigre]]", with height {{convert|55|m|ft|0}}; the other is called "[[La Danta]]" (or Danta) temple. The La Danta temple measures approximately {{convert|72|m|ft}} tall from the forest floor,&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.253.&lt;/ref&gt; and considering its total volume (2,800,000 cubic meters) is one of the largest [[pyramids]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Geographic Channel]] ‚Äì ''Dawn of the Maya''&lt;/ref&gt; When the large man-made platform that the temple is built upon (some 18,000 square meters) is included in calculations, La Danta is considered by some archeologists to be one of the most massive ancient structures in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video  | people = Brooke Baldwin  | title = The forgotten city of Mirador   | url = http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2009/10/23/baldwin.mirador.forgotten.maya.cnn  | medium = Flash  |website=CNN.com| location =  Mirador, Guatemala | date = October 24, 2009  | accessdate = June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the "[[Los Monos]]" complex is very large (48 meters high) although not as well known. Most of the structures were originally faced with cut stone which was then decorated with large [[stucco]] masks depicting the deities of [[Maya mythology]]. According to [[Carlos Morales-Aguilar]], a Guatemalan archaeologist from [[Pantheon-Sorbonne University]], the city appears to have been planned from its foundation, as extraordinary alignments have been found between the architectural groups and main temples, which were possibly related to solar alignments.&lt;ref&gt;≈†prajc et al. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The study reflects an importance of urban planning and sacred spaces since the first settlers. [[File:El_Mirador_5.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Stucco friezes at El Mirador that adorned the banks of a water-collecting system.]]

An additional feature of El Mirador is the quantity and size of causeways, internally linking important architectural compounds, and externally linking the numerous major ancient cities within the Mirador Basin during the latter part of the Middle and Late [[Preclassic Maya|Preclassic]] periods. The causeways are commonly referred to as ''[[sacbe]]ob'' (the plural form of ''sacbe'', meaning "white road" in [[Yucatec Maya language|Mayan]], from ''sac'' "white" and ''be'' "road"). These are raised stone causeways raising 2 to 6 meters above the level of the surrounding [[landscape]] and measuring from 20 to 50 meters wide. One ''sacbe'' links El Mirador to the neighbouring site of [[Nakbe]], approximately 12&amp;nbsp;km away, while another joined El Mirador to [[El Tintal]], 20&amp;nbsp;km away.

While the city and the sister centers of the Mirador Basin thrived between 300 BCE and the Common Era (CE), apparently, the site was abandoned, as were nearly all other major sites in the area, by about 150 CE. A large wall, which must have been as high as 3 to 8 meters,  had been constructed on the entire northern, eastern, and southern portions of the West Group of the city prior to its abandonment in the terminal Preclassic period, suggesting a possible threat that had been perceived by this time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netlibrary.ws/articles/eng/El_Mirador World Library, El Mirador]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect that may have led to the downfall of the system, was soil erosion due to deforestation. The Maya were fond of plastering buildings, houses, floors and even ceramics with layers of lime plaster called stucco. This plaster created a nice smooth surface which facilitated painting. With this stucco, the Maya created many astonishingly beautiful artifacts, as well as smooth-walled pyramids and 'paved' roads. But a darker side to this production became evident when consumption started to evolve into conspicuous consumption. The production of lime needs a large amount of wood. Archeologists have calculated that for the production of 1 ton of lime cement, 5 tonnes of limestone and 5 tonnes of wood were needed. Also, dry wood was not suitable due to the large fluctuations in temperature, as a stable temperature was needed to properly burn the limestone. To accomplish this, green wood was needed. So the Maya cut down every available green tree in the area.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Excavations in and around the bajos (swamps) revealed the effects of deforestation. When trees vanish, the soil becomes loose and is easily transported by water (e.g. rain). Also, water flows downhill, and the only places in the Basin where it could flow to, were these bajos. The nutrient-rich muck that was so vigorously imported from the bajos was now buried under a 2 to 3 metre thick layer of sterile clay. This cut-off the driving force behind the sustainable agricultural fields. When you cannot replenish your crop fields, more and more harvests start to fail. In the end the failing crop fields led to starvation and collapse of society.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In the Late Classic period, ca 700 CE, portions of the site were reoccupied on a more modest scale, with small structures nestled among the ruins of the great preclassic center. The largest structure from this time period is scarcely more than 8 meters high, and many of the preclassic building were plundered for stone materials for construction and lime making.  The Late Classic occupants however, were noted scribes and artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblioteca.usac.edu.gt/tesis/14/14_0434.pdf |format=PDF|title=''THE CENTRAL AREA OF EL MIRADOR DURING THE LATE CLASSIC PERIOD|language=es|website=Biblioteca.usac.edu.gt|accessdate=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area of the Mirador Basin is the only known source of the "codex-style [[Pottery|ceramics]]", a particularly fine polychrome ceramic consisting of black line drawings on a cream colored background. The Late Classic occupation was brief, and by about 900 CE, the area was again nearly completely abandoned, and remains so until the present time.

==Today==
[[Richard D. Hansen]], an archaeologist from [[Idaho State University]], is the current director of the [[Mirador Basin]] Project, and according to his discoveries here, he thinks that the more than 45 mapped sites in the [[Mirador Basin]] may have formed the earliest well-defined political state in Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/el-mirador-the-lost-city-of-the-maya-1741461/ Smithsonian Magazine, El Mirador, the Lost City of the Maya, May 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:El Mirador 1.jpg|thumb|left|Exposed stonework at El Mirador in 2000]]
Although containing striking examples of Preclassic Maya civilization, the remote location of El Mirador has prevented it from becoming a popular tourist site. Major plans by the current government of Guatemala include El Mirador as an important center of the [[Cuatro Balam]] Conservation and Development project.&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed:  [[Image:nakbe2.jpeg|thumb|400px|right|Structure 34 in El Mirador, painting by T.

==Threats to Mirador==
This large concentration of Preclassic Maya cities in Mesoamerica is threatened by massive deforestation, looting, and destruction caused by equipment used in logging road construction, which itself facilitates intrusive settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Archaeology Magazine ‚Äì Under Threat, January/February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Mirador Basin in the far northern Pet√©n region of Guatemala is known for its abundance of sites, many of which are among the largest and earliest in the Maya world. Of 26 known sites, only 14 have been studied; an estimated 30 more await discovery. By the time scholars get there, looters may already have plundered them:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Trafficking in Maya artifacts is big business. [[George S. Stuart]] of the National Geographic Society has suggested that 1,000 pieces of fine pottery leave the Maya region each month, not an unreasonable estimate in light of the site damage observed. The most sought-after finds are codex-style ceramics, Late Classic (600‚Äì900 CE) black-line-on-cream pottery depicting mythological and historical events. Looters are often paid between $200 and $500 per vessel.  Collectors may pay more than $100,000 for the same pieces in a gallery or at auction. At even minimal prices this amounts to a $10-million-a-month business in stolen cultural property. Collecting Precolumbian art is often viewed as a justifiable means of preserving the past. It is, in fact, a destructive and sometimes violent business, as attested to by the recent assassination in Carmelita of Carlos Catal√°n, a local chiclero who had become a staunch opponent of looting in Pet√©n."&lt;ref&gt;Archaeology Magazine. Plundering the Pet√©n, September/October 1997
by Richard D. Hansen&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since 2003, California-based non-profit organization [[Global Heritage Fund]] (GHF) has been working to preserve and protect Mirador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalheritagefund.org/what_we_do/overview/current_projects/mirador_guatemala |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209071511/http://globalheritagefund.org/what_we_do/overview/current_projects/mirador_guatemala |archivedate=2010-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an October 2010 report titled ''[[Saving Our Vanishing Heritage]]'', GHF listed Mirador as one of 12 worldwide heritage sites most "On the Verge" of irreparable loss and destruction, citing deforestation, fires, major logging, poaching, looting, and narcotics trafficking as major threats to the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalheritagefund.org/what_we_do/introduction |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705231526/http://globalheritagefund.org/what_we_do/introduction |archivedate=2012-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Femininity is sometimes linked with [[sexual objectification]] and [[sexual appeal]].&lt;ref name="Kloppenborg"&gt;Ria Kloppenborg, Wouter J. Hanegraaff, ''Female stereotypes in religious traditions'', BRILL, 1995, {{ISBN|90-04-10290-6}}, {{ISBN|978-90-04-10290-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ussher"&gt;Ussher, Jane M. ''Fantasies of femininity: reframing the boundaries of sex ''&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual passiveness, or sexual receptivity, is sometimes considered feminine while sexual assertiveness and sexual desire is sometimes considered masculine.&lt;ref name="Ussher" /&gt;

People who exhibit a combination of both [[Masculinity|masculine]] and feminine characteristics are considered [[Androgyny|androgynous]], and feminist philosophers have argued that gender ambiguity may blur gender classification.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith (1999 [1990]), Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity (New York and London: Routledge).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurie, Timothy (2014), 'The Ethics of Nobody I Know: Gender and the Politics of Description', Qualitative Research Journal, 14 (1), pp. 64-78.URL: https://www.academia.edu/6262250/The_Ethics_of_Nobody_I_Know_Gender_and_the_Politics_of_Description&lt;/ref&gt; Modern conceptualizations of femininity also rely not just upon social constructions, but upon the individualized choices made by women.&lt;ref&gt;Budgeon, Shelley(2015), 'Individualized femininity and feminist politics of choice..', European Journal of Women's Studies, 22 (3), pp. 303-318.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ann Oakley]]'s sex/[[gender]] dichotomy has had a considerable influence on sociologists defining masculine and feminine behavior as regulated, policed, and reproduced in our society, as well as the power structures relating to the concepts.

An ongoing debate with regards to [[sex and psychology]] concerns the extent to which gender identity and gender-specific behavior is due to socialization versus inborn factors.&lt;ref name="Wijngaard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch and Cody"&gt;{{cite book|authors =Pamela J.

In 1959, researchers such as [[John Money]] and Anke Erhardt proposed the prenatal hormone theory. Their research argues that sexual organs bathe the embryo with hormones in the womb, resulting in the birth of an individual with a distinctively male or female brain; this was suggested by some to "predict future behavioral development in a masculine or feminine direction".&lt;ref name="Wijngaard"/&gt; This theory, however, has been criticized on theoretical and empirical grounds and remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehrhardt|first=Anke A.|author2=H.

Mary Vetterling-Braggin argues that all characteristics associated with femininity arose from early human sexual encounters which were mainly male-forced and female-unwilling, because of male and female anatomical differences.&lt;ref name="Vetterling-Braggin" /&gt; Others, such as [[Carole Pateman]], Ria Kloppenborg, and Wouter J. Hanegraaff, argue that the definition of femininity is the result of how females must behave in order to maintain a [[patriarchy|patriarchal social system]].&lt;ref name="Kloppenborg" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pateman, Carole (1988).

In his 1998 book ''Masculinity and Femininity: the Taboo Dimension of National Cultures'', Dutch psychologist and researcher [[Geert Hofstede]] wrote that only behaviors directly connected with procreation can, strictly speaking, be described as feminine or masculine, and yet every society worldwide recognizes many additional behaviors as more suitable to females than males, and vice versa. He describes these as relatively arbitrary choices mediated by cultural norms and traditions, identifying "masculinity versus femininity" as one of five basic dimensions in [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|his theory of cultural dimensions]]. Hofstede describes as feminine behaviors such as "service", "permissiveness", and "benevolence", and describes as feminine those countries stressing equality, solidarity, quality of [[work-life]], and the resolution of conflicts by compromise and negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Masculinity and Femininity: The Taboo Dimension of National Cultures|last = Hofstede|first = Geert|publisher = SAGE Publications, Inc.|year = 1998|isbn = 0761910298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Culture: Dimensions|url=http://geert-hofstede.com/dimensions.html|work=|publisher=The Hofstede Centre|accessdate=14 August 2013|quote=The masculinity side of this dimension represents a preference in society for achievement, heroism, assertiveness and material reward for success.

In [[Carl Jung]]'s school of [[analytical psychology]], the [[anima and animus]] are the two primary [[Jungian archetypes|anthropomorphic archetypes]] of the unconscious mind. The anima and animus are described by Jung as elements of his theory of the [[collective unconscious]], a domain of the unconscious that transcends the personal psyche. In the unconscious of the male, it finds expression as a feminine inner personality: anima; equivalently, in the unconscious of the female, it is expressed as a masculine inner personality: animus.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Carl.

==Clothing and appearance==
{{Main|Clothing#Gender differentiation}}
{{see also|List of historical sources for pink and blue as gender signifiers}}
In Western cultures, the ideal of feminine appearance has traditionally included long, flowing hair, clear skin, a narrow waist, and little or no [[body hair]] or facial hair.&lt;ref name="Ferrante" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lesnik-Oberstein|first=Kar√≠n|title=The Last Taboo: Women and Body Hair|year=2010|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=0-7190-8323-0|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Kathy|title=Dubious Equalities and Embodied Differences: Cultural Studies on Cosmetic Surgery|year=2003|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham|page=93|isbn=0-7425-1421-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cultures, however, expectations are different. For example, in many parts of the world, underarm hair is not considered unfeminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLoughlin|first=Linda|title=The Language of Magazines|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-21424-6|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the color pink is strongly associated with femininity, whereas in the early 1900s pink was associated with boys and blue with girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bolich|first1=G.

===In history===
[[Image:eye makeup.jpg|thumb|200px|In some cultures, cosmetics are associated with femininity]]
Cultural standards vary a great deal on what is considered feminine. For example, in 16th century France, [[High-heeled footwear|high heels]] were considered a distinctly masculine type of shoe, though they are currently considered feminine.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, William, ''Art of shoe making'', Global Media, 2007, 8189940295, 9788189940294&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kremer|first=William|title=Why did men stop wearing high heels?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21151350|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 January 2013|date=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Egypt]], sheath and beaded net dresses were considered female clothing, while wraparound dresses, [[perfumes]], cosmetics, and elaborate jewelry were worn by both men and women. In [[Ancient Persia]], clothing was generally [[unisex]], though women wore [[veil]]s and [[headscarves]]. Women in [[Ancient Greece]] wore [[himation]]s; and in [[Ancient Rome]] women wore the [[palla (garment)|palla]], a rectangular mantle, and the maphorion.&lt;ref name="Condra"&gt;Condra, Jill, ''The Greenwood encyclopedia of clothing through world history: Prehistory to 1500 CE'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, {{ISBN|0-313-33663-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-313-33663-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical feminine outfit of aristocratic women of the [[Renaissance]] was an undershirt with a [[gown]] and a high-waisted overgown, and a plucked forehead and beehive or turban-style hairdo.&lt;ref name="Condra" /&gt;

===Body alteration===

==Ideal feminine==
{{further|Cult of Domesticity|Ideal womanhood|Good Wife, Wise Mother|}}
What is considered as the ''ideal feminine'' is defined by each individual culture based on what that culture considers [[Value (personal and cultural)|valuable]], and is often the subject of heated debate.

===Scholarly views===
[[File:Et nous aussi nous serons meres Lequeu.jpg|thumb|''And we too, shall be mothers, because.......!'' by Jean-Jacques Lequeu, 1794]]
To understand the term "ideal feminine", we need to understand what femininity is. ‚ÄúIt embodies a constellation of meanings, it generally refers to the attributes, behaviors, interests, mannerisms, appearances, roles, and expectations that we have come to associate with being female during the socialization processes. Gender role socialization relies on modeling and reinforcement ‚Äì girls and women learn and internalize socially expected and acceptable feminine traits and behaviors and are rewarded for gender-appropriate behavior.‚Äù &lt;ref name="Shea, Munyi 2014"&gt;Shea, Munyi, et al. "Toward A Constructionist Perspective Of Examining Femininity Experience: The Development And Psychometric Properties Of The Subjective Femininity Stress Scale." Psychology Of Women Quarterly 38.2 (2014): 275-291. Academic Search Complete. Web. 23 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Psychology of Women Quarterly also mentions that there are numerous psychological problems that are related to femininity among women and adolescent girls. The [[social construct]] of femininity has adverse effects on women. What is lacking in current research of femininity is "a tool that allows for understanding women's subjective femininity experiences and assessing their relationships to women's psychological health."&lt;ref name="Shea, Munyi 2014" /&gt; What was later developed was the ''Subjective Femininity Stress Scale'' (SFSS), a scale that measures women's experiences of being female and to rate the levels of stress they may feel associated with their feminine experiences. We also know that "feminine norms from the dominant culture are insidiously powerful and pervasive and are likely to influence every woman living in American society [...] empirical evidence suggests that current studies on femininity (i.e. traits, role norms, gender role stress) may not fully capture the experiences of women from diverse backgrounds."&lt;ref name="Shea, Munyi 2014" /&gt;

The ideal feminine has been debated for centuries. [[Virginia Woolf]] writes, "Women have served all these centuries as looking-glasses possessing the magic and delicious power of reflecting the figure of man at twice its natural size."&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Virginia. A Room of One's Own. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1989. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Woolf describes her as the Angel of the House. "She was intensely sympathetic. She was immensely charming. She was utterly unselfish. She excelled in the difficult arts of family life. She sacrificed herself daily. If there was chicken, she took the leg; if there was a draught she sat in it‚Äîin short she was so constituted that she never had a mind or a wish of her own, but preferred to sympathize always with the minds and wishes of others. Above all‚ÄîI need not say it‚Äîshe was pure. Her purity was supposed to be her chief beauty--her blushes, her great grace. In those days‚Äîthe last of Queen Victoria‚Äîevery house had its Angel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woolf|first1=Virginia|title=Professions for Women|url=http://s.spachman.tripod.com/Woolf/professions.htm|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This relates to [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s point that women are the "other." Beauvoir points out that, "Man can think of himself without woman. She cannot think of herself without man. And she is simply what man decrees; thus called 'the sex', by which is meant that [...] she is sex ‚Äì absolute sex, no less. She is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her; she is the incidental, the inessential as opposed to the essential. He is the Subject, he is the Absolute ‚Äì she is the Other."&lt;ref name="Beauvoir 1953"&gt;de Beauvoir, Simone. The Second Sex. New York: Knopf, 1953. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Beauvoir says that women are the "Second Sex" because they are secondary to men. Her coining of the "[[eternal feminine]]" solidifies this idea of ideal femininity. She was stating that a woman's femininity determines her worth and that a woman's value is based on the man's default. This "eternal feminine" was constructed because, as she points out, "They are women in virtue of their anatomy and physiology. Throughout history they have always been subordinated to men, and hence their dependency is not the result of a historical event or a social change ‚Äì it was not something that occurred."&lt;ref name="Beauvoir 1953" /&gt; In order to understand the ideal feminine, one must understand the social constructs that made the ideal feminine.

[[Betty Friedan]], who wrote ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', also weighs in on the subject of the ideal feminine. She notes that, "The feminine mystique permits, even encourages, women to ignore the question of their identity. The mystique says they can answer the question 'Who am I?' by saying 'Tom's wife... Mary's mother.' ‚Äì an American woman no longer has a private image to tell her who she is, or can be, or wants to be,"&lt;ref name="Friedan, Betty 1963"&gt;Friedan, Betty. The Feminine Mystique. New York: W.W. Norton, 1963. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and that women are not considered female if they do not abide by these societal norms and mores. Friedan thinks that "the core of the problem for women today is not sexual but a problem of identity ‚Äì a stunting or evasion of growth that is perpetuated by the feminine mystique."&lt;ref name="Friedan, Betty 1963" /&gt; At the time this book was written, women were constantly shown their roles were that of the homemaker and the nurturer ‚Äì if they wanted to be considered feminine, they would prescribe to these roles.

If ideal femininity is a woman who accepts and encourages femininity in all its forms, the opposite of the ideal feminine would be a lesbian. They may shed the feminine identity in order to build their own identity and fight the "feminine mystique". [[Monique Wittig]] writes, "lesbian society destroys the artificial (social) fact constituting women as a 'natural group.' A lesbian society pragmatically reveals that the division from men of which women have been the object is a political one and shows that we have been ideologically rebuilt into a 'natural group.' In the case of women, ideology goes far since our bodies as well as our minds are the product of this manipulation." She goes on to say, "as individuals as well we question 'woman,' which for us, as for Simone de Beauvoir, is only a myth." Wittig believes that women must, as the lesbians are doing, reject the definition of "'woman', which is imposed on them."&lt;ref name="oocities.org"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wittig|first1=Monique|title=One Is Not Born A Woman|url=http://www.oocities.org/saidyoungman/wittig01.htm|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leadership is associated with masculinity in Western culture and women are perceived less favorably as potential leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Chin, Jean Lau, ''Women and leadership: transforming visions and diverse voices'' Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, {{ISBN|1-4051-5582-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-5582-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some people have argued that the "feminine"-style leadership, which is associated with leadership that focuses on help and cooperation, is advantageous over "masculine" leadership, which is associated with focusing on tasks and control.&lt;ref name="Klenke"&gt;Klenke, Karin, ''Women and Leadership: A Contextual Perspective '', Springer Publishing Company, 2004 {{ISBN|0-8261-9221-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8261-9221-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female leaders are more often described by Western media using characteristics associated with femininity, such as emotion.&lt;ref name="Klenke" /&gt;

=== Explanations for occupational imbalance ===
It has been argued that primary sex characteristics of men and women, such as the ability to bear children, caused a historical sexual division of labor and gender stereotypes evolved culturally to perpetuate this division.&lt;ref name="Worell" /&gt;

The practice of bearing children tends to interrupt the continuity of employment. According to [[human capital]] theory, this retracts from the female investment in higher education and employment training. Richard Anker of the [[International Labour Office]] argues human capital theory does not explain the sexual division of labor because many occupations tied to feminine roles, such as administrative assistance, require more knowledge, experience, and continuity of employment than unskilled masculinized occupations, such as [[truck driving]]. Anker argues the feminization of certain occupations limits employment options for women.&lt;ref name="Anker" /&gt;

====Role congruity theory====
[[Role congruity theory]] proposes that people tend to view deviations from expected gender roles negatively. It supports the empirical evidence that gender discrimination exists in areas traditionally associated with one gender or the other. It is sometimes used to explain why people have a tendency to evaluate behavior that fulfills the prescriptions of a leader role less favorably when it is enacted by a woman.&lt;ref name="EAH &amp; KSJ"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eagly | first1 = Alice H. | last2 = Karau | first2 = Steven J. | year = 2002 | title = Role congruity theory of prejudice toward female leaders | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 109 | issue = 3| pages = 573‚Äì598 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.109.3.573 | pmid=12088246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heilman 1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heilman | first1 = Madeline E. | last2 = Wallen | first2 = Aaron S. | last3 = Fuchs | first3 = Daniella | last4 = Tamkins | first4 = Melinda M. | year = 2004 | title = Penalties for Success: Reactions to Women Who Succeed at Male Gender-Typed Tasks | url = http://www.genderinscience.org/downloads/BMS_references/Heilman%20adn%20Wallen%202004.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 89 | issue = 3| pages = 416‚Äì427 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.89.3.416 | pmid=15161402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rudman &amp; glick"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rudman | first1 = Laurie A. | last2 = Glick | first2 = Peter | year = 2001 | title = Prescriptive Gender Stereotypes and Backlash Towards Agentic Women | url = https://books.google.com/?id=2-FvSJ8sdaIC&amp;pg=PA743 | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 57 | issue = 4| pages = 743‚Äì762 | doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00239| isbn = 9781405100847 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heilman 2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heilman | first1 = Madeline E | year = 2001 | title = Description and Prescription: How Gender Stereotypes Prevent Women's Ascent Up the Organizational Ladder | url = https://books.google.com/?id=2-FvSJ8sdaIC&amp;pg=PA657 | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 57 | issue = 4| pages = 657‚Äì674 | doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00234| isbn = 9781405100847 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schein"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schein | first1 = Virginia E | year = 2001 | title = A Global Look at Psychological Barriers to Women's Progress in Management | url = https://books.google.com/?id=2-FvSJ8sdaIC&amp;pg=PA675 | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 57 | issue = 4| pages = 675‚Äì688 | doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00235| isbn = 9781405100847 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hindu]] traditions, [[Devi]] is the female aspect of the divine. [[Shakti]] is the divine feminine creative power, the sacred force that moves through the entire universe&lt;ref&gt;Sacred Sanskrit words, p.111&lt;/ref&gt; and the agent of change. She is the female counterpart without whom the male aspect, which represents [[consciousness]] or discrimination, remains impotent and void. As the female manifestation of the supreme lord, she is also called [[Prakriti]], the basic nature of intelligence by which the [[Universe]] exists and functions. In [[Hinduism]], the universal creative force [[Yoni]] is [[feminine]], with inspiration being the life force of creation.
[[File:Esoteric Taijitu.svg|thumb|50px|[[Yin and yang]]]]

In [[Taoism]], the concept of ''yin'' represents the primary force of the female half of [[yin and yang]]. The yin is also present, to a smaller proportion, in the male half. The yin can be characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Osgood | first1 = Charles E | year = 1973 | title = From Yang and Yin to and or but | url = | journal = Language | volume = 49 | issue = 2| pages = 380‚Äì412 | doi=10.2307/412460| jstor = 412460 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Buddhism]], [[Women in Buddhism|women]] have been recognized and characterized vary in terms of their ability to achieve the truth of the Buddhahood (enlightenment) based on the [[Schools of Buddhism|Buddhist schools]]. For example, [[sutras]] in [[Early Buddhism]] depicted "A woman of a top master of Wisdom" as a woman who achieved enlightenment. But later [[Hinayana]] preached such great persons,including the ten great disciples of Buddha, are limited to men, with women as an inferior being, and as the whole, denied the possibility of women's enlightenment in this lifetime (i.e. woman should reborn as men in future lifetime). Then [[Mahayana|Mahayara]] again stated woman's enlightenment as a result of the present time practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender Equality in Buddhism|last=Masatoshi|first=Ueki|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2001|isbn=0820451339|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judeo-Christian theology===
[[File:SaintSophia0.jpg|thumb|170px|Holy Wisdom: Hagia Sophia]]
Although the [[Judeo-Christian God]] is typically described in masculine terms‚Äîsuch as father, king, warrior‚Äîmany theologians argue that this is not meant to indicate the [[gender of God]].&lt;ref name="McGrath2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=McGrath|first=Alister E.|title=Christian Theology: An Introduction|year=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=1-4443-3514-6|pages=197‚Äì199|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], God "is neither man nor woman: he is God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P17.HTM |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303003725/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P17.HTM |archivedate=March 3, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several recent writers, such as Sally McFague, have explored the idea of "God as mother", examining the feminine qualities attributed to God. For example, in the [[Book of Isaiah]], God is compared to a mother comforting her child, while in the [[Book of Deuteronomy]], God is said to have given birth to Israel.&lt;ref name="McGrath2010" /&gt;

The [[Book of Genesis]] describes divine creation of the world out of nothing or [[ex nihilo]]. In [[Wisdom literature]] and in the [[wisdom tradition]], ''[[wisdom]]'' is described as feminine. In many books of the Old Testament, including Wisdom and Sirach, wisdom is personified and called "she." According to David Winston, because ''wisdom'' is God's "creative agent," she must be intimately identified with God.&lt;ref&gt;David Winston, The Wisdom of Solomon: a new translation with introduction and commentary, (New York, Doubleday, 1979), p. 194 {{ISBN|0-385-01644-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Wisdom of God]]'' is feminine in [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]]: ''[[Chokhmah]]'', in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''[[Hikmah]]'', in [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''[[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]]'', and in [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''[[Sapientia]]''. In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], both [[Shekhinah]] (the [[Holy Spirit]] and [[divine presence]] of God) and [[Ruach HaKodesh]] (divine inspiration) are feminine.

In the Jewish [[Kabbalah]], [[Chokhmah (Kabbalah)|Chokhmah]] (wisdom and intuition) is the force in the creative process that God used to create the heavens and the earth. [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]] (understanding and perception) is the great mother, the feminine receiver of energy and giver of form. Binah receives the intuitive insight from Chokhmah and dwells on it in the same way that a mother receives the seed from the father, and keeps it within her until it's time to give birth. The intuition, once received and contemplated with perception, leads to the [[Creation myth|Creation of the Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christ-centeredkabbalah.org/Studies/glossary.htm |title=The Kabbalah Of Isaac Luria Glossary |publisher=Christ-centeredkabbalah.org |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128235329/http://www.christ-centeredkabbalah.org/Studies/glossary.htm |archivedate=January 28, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the initial state portrayals of idealized femininity as strong and hard-working began to also include more traditional notions such as gentleness, caring and nurturing behaviour, softness, modesty and moral virtue,&lt;ref name="Brown 2009 70" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fawn 2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fawn|first=ed. by Rick|title=Russia after Communism|year=2002|publisher=Cass|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=0714652938|edition=1. publ.|author2=White, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|53}} requiring good Communist women to become "superheroes who excelled in all spheres", including working at jobs not traditionally regarded as feminine in nature.&lt;ref name="Fawn 2002" /&gt; {{rp|55‚Äì60}}

Communist ideology explicitly rejected some aspects of traditional femininity that it viewed as bourgeois and consumerist, such as helplessness, idleness and self-adornment. In Communist countries, some women resented not having access to cosmetics and fashionable clothes. In her 1993 book of essays ''[[How We Survived Communism &amp; Even Laughed]]'', [[Croatia]]n journalist and novelist [[Slavenka Drakulic]] wrote about "a complaint I heard repeatedly from women in Warsaw, Budapest, Prague, Sofia, East Berlin: 'Look at us ‚Äì we don't even look like women. There are no deodorants, perfumes, sometimes even no soap or toothpaste. There is no fine underwear, no pantyhose, no nice lingerie"&lt;ref name="Drakuliƒá 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Drakuliƒá|first=Slavenka|title=How we Survived Communism and even Laughed|year=2003|publisher=HarperPerennial|location=New York|isbn=0060975407|edition=1.

The images that cross the borders in magazines, movies or videos are therefore more dangerous than any secret weapon, because they make one desire that 'otherness' badly enough to risk one's life trying to escape."&lt;ref name="Drakuliƒá 2003" /&gt; {{rp|28‚Äì9}}

As Communist countries such as [[Romania]] and the [[Soviet Union]] began to liberalize, their official media began representing women in more conventionally feminine ways compared with the "rotund farm workers and plain-Jane factory hand" depictions they had previously been publishing. As perfumes, cosmetics, fashionable clothing, and footwear became available to ordinary women in the Soviet Union, [[East Germany]], Poland, [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Hungary]], they began to be presented not as bourgeois frivolities but as signs of socialist modernity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bren|first=edited by Paulina|title=Communism Unwrapped: Consumption in Cold War Eastern Europe|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0199827672|page=230|author2=Neuburger, Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, with the economic liberation started by [[Deng Xiaoping]] in the 1980s, the state stopped discouraging women from expressing conventional femininity, and gender stereotypes and commercialized sexualization of women which had been suppressed under Communist ideology began to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Halpern|first=Diane F. and Fanny M.

Cross-dressing and drag are two public performances of femininity within men that have been most popularly known and understood throughout many western cultures. Men who wear clothing associated with femininity are often called [[Cross-dressing|cross-dressers]].&lt;ref&gt;cross-dress." The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[drag queen]] is a man who wears flamboyant women's clothing and behaves in an exaggeratedly feminine manner for entertainment purposes.

==Feminist views==
{{Feminism sidebar}}
{{See also|Feminism}}
Feminist philosophers such as [[Judith Butler]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]]&lt;ref name="Wijngaard" /&gt; contend that femininity and masculinity are created through repeated performances of gender; these performances reproduce and define the traditional categories of sex and/or gender.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, J. (1990). ''Gender trouble: Feminism and the subversion of identity.'' New York; Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[second-wave feminism|second-wave feminists]] reject what they regard as constricting standards of female beauty, created for the subordination and objectifying of women and self-perpetuated by reproductive competition and women's own aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/1781 |title=Sally Feldman ‚Äì Heights of madness |publisher=New Humanist |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as [[Lipstick feminism|lipstick feminists]] and some other [[third-wave feminism|third-wave feminists]], argue that feminism shouldn't devalue feminine culture and identity, and that symbols of feminine identity such as make-up, suggestive clothing and having a sexual allure can be valid and empowering personal choices for both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon, Jennifer, Bad girls go everywhere: the life of Helen Gurley Brown, Oxford University Press US, 2009, {{ISBN|0-19-534205-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-534205-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Hollows; Rachel Moseley (February 17, 2006).

[[#Julia Serano.27s transfeminist critique|Julia Serano]] notes that masculine girls and women face much less social disapproval than feminine boys and men, which she attributes to sexism. Serano argues that women wanting to be like men is consistent with the idea that maleness is more valued in contemporary culture than femaleness, whereas men being willing to give up [[masculinity]] in favour of femininity directly threatens the notion of male superiority as well as the idea that men and women should be opposites. To support her thesis, Serano cites the far greater public scrutiny and disdain experienced by [[Trans woman|male-to-female]] [[cross-dressers]] compared with that faced by women who dress in masculine clothes, as well as research showing that parents are likelier to respond negatively to sons who like Barbie dolls and ballet or wear nail polish than they are to daughters exhibiting comparably masculine behaviours.&lt;ref name="Serano 2007" /&gt;{{rp|284‚Äì292}}

=== Julia Serano's transfeminist critique ===
In her 2007 book ''[[Whipping Girl|Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity]]'', American [[transsexual]] writer and [[biologist]] [[Julia Serano]] offers a [[transfeminism|transfeminist]] critique of femininity, notable especially for its call to [[empowerment|empower]] femininity:&lt;ref name="Serano 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Serano|first=Julia|title=Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity|year=2007|publisher=Seal Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=1580051545|url=http://www.juliaserano.com/whippinggirl.html|quote=Until feminists work to empower femininity and pry it away from the insipid, inferior meanings that plague it ‚Äì weakness, helplessness, fragility, passivity, frivolity, and artificiality ‚Äì those meanings will continue to haunt every person who is female and/or feminine.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rasmussen |first=Debbie |title=Risk: Feminine Protection (interview with Julia Serano) |url=http://bitchmagazine.org/article/feminine-protection |accessdate=15 August 2013 |newspaper=[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]] |year=2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ist7lBkf?url=http://bitchmagazine.org/article/feminine-protection |archivedate=August 15, 2013 |quote=The rising visibility of trans, intersex, and genderqueer movements has led feminists‚Äîand, to a lesser extent, the rest of the world‚Äîto an increasing awareness that m and f are only the beginning of the story of gender identity. With the release of Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity, Julia Serano offers a perspective sorely needed, but up until now rarely heard: a transfeminine critique of both feminist and mainstream understandings of gender. |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quotation|In this book, I break with past attempts in feminism and queer theory to dismiss femininity by characterizing it as ‚Äúartificial‚Äù or ‚Äúperformance.‚Äù Instead, I argue that certain aspects of femininity (as well as masculinity) are natural and can both precede socialization and supersede biological sex. For these reasons, I believe that it is negligent for feminists to only focus on those who are female-bodied, or for transgender activists to only talk about binary gender norms, as no form of gender equity can ever truly be achieved until we first work to empower all forms of femininity.}}

Serano notes that some behaviors, such as frequent smiling or avoiding eye contact with strangers, are considered feminine because they are practiced disproportionately by women, and likely have resulted from women's attempts to negotiate through a world which is sometimes hostile to them.&lt;ref name="Serano 2007" /&gt;{{rp|322}}

Serano argues that because contemporary culture is sexist, it assigns negative connotations to, or trivializes, behaviours understood to be feminine such as gossiping, behaving emotionally or decorating. It also recasts and reimagines femininity through a male [[heterosexual]] lens, for example interpreting women's empathy and altruism as husband-and-child-focused rather than globally focused, and interpreting women's interest in aesthetics as intended solely to entice or attract men.&lt;ref name="Serano 2007" /&gt;{{rp|327‚Äì8}} She writes that femininity is frequently understood as perplexing and mysterious, and notes that words like spell-binding and enchanting are often used to describe feminine women, illustrating that men don't need to understand and appreciate women's experiences in the same way in which women must understand and appreciate theirs, and indeed that men are discouraged from doing so.&lt;ref name="Serano 2007" /&gt;{{rp|292‚Äì3}}

== Queer femininity ==
By definition, femininity is based on gendered norms of [[gender identity|identity]]. Femininity within queer cultures is still limited and regulated when applied to an intersectional framework of identity.

=== Hetero-normative context ===

==== Representations within queer cultures and identities ====
Within the queer community, there is a mainstream visibility of masculine, queer women (particularly lesbians).&lt;ref name="Blackman, Lisa 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blackman | first1 = Lisa | year = 2009 | title = The Re-Making of Sexual Kinds: Queer Subjects and the Limits of Representation | url = | journal = Journal of Lesbian Studies | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 122‚Äì35 | doi=10.1080/10894160802695312| pmid = 19363759 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This privileged queer masculinity creates an ideal for queer women, which is in direct contrast to femininity. Much of this idealist stigma eliminates the validity of femininity within queer women. Distinctively, femininity within queer men (particularly gay men) and transgender women occupies the dominant, accepted narrative of gender and/or sexuality embodiment. As is understood, femininity is not a totalizing product or manifestation of one's queer, gender identity. However, with this imbalance of representation and affirmation of these embodiments within the [[queer community]], there is a perpetuation of queer standards of gendered femininity (and [[masculinity]]).&lt;ref name="Blackman, Lisa 2009"/&gt; When identifying queer femininity, following practices of adequate, inter sectional representations can be challenging because there is no one totalizing embodiment of femininity that is applied to and resulting from a queer label (or rejection of a label).

Femininity, by definition, is based on a gendered, hetero-normative standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Negotiating Identities in a Heteronormative Context. 60 Journal of Homosexuality 639-54. N.d.&lt;/ref&gt; This gendered, hetero-normative context, is often believed to be a biological, natural state of identity; understanding gender, sex, and sexuality as fixed characteristics that manifest in an "activation" of these characteristics, within queer persons who do not identify with a gender (i.e. [[gender fluid]], [[gender non-conforming]], etc.) is still understood on a gendered basis.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Milton. "Biased-Interaction Theory of Psychosexual Development: "How Does One Know If One Is Male or Female?"." ''Sex Roles'' 55.9/10 (2006): 589-600&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a marginalization of such queer individuals, and consequently limits the freedom of expression within the queer community. The fluidity and multiplicity of feminine (and masculine) embodiment is not understood as an adequately complex, non-traditional or permanent means of expression of identity through one's lived experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = Erin Calhoun | year = 2009 | title = Situating "fluidity" | url = | journal = GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian &amp; Gay Studies | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 97‚Äì130 | doi=10.1215/10642684-2008-020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elia | first1 = John P. | last2 = Eliason | first2 = Mickey | year = 2010 | title = Discourses of Exclusion: Sexuality Education's Silencing of Sexual Others | url = | journal = Journal of LGBT Youth | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 29‚Äì48 | doi=10.1080/19361650903507791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stigma ===
There is a hierarchy of queer validity and legitimacy in relation to representations of queer identities.&lt;ref name="Taywaditep, Kittiwut Jod 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taywaditep | first1 = Kittiwut Jod | year = 2001 | title = Marginalization Among the Marginalized: Gay Men's Anti-Effeminacy Attitudes | url = | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 42 | issue = 1| pages = 1‚Äì28 | doi=10.1300/j082v42n01_01| pmid = 11991561 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burdge | first1 = Barb J | year = 2007 | title = Bending Gender, Ending Gender: Theoretical Foundations for Social Work Practice with the Transgender Community | url = | journal = Social Work | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 243‚Äì50 | doi=10.1093/sw/52.3.243| pmid = 17850032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chaitman | first1 = Steven | year = 2013 | title = Asexuals Make Presence Known, Seek LGBTQ Allies | url = | journal = Windy City Times | volume = 28 | issue = 13| page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feldman | first1 = Susan | year = 2009 | title = Reclaiming Sexual Difference: What Queer Theory Can't Tell Us about Sexuality | url = | journal = Journal of Bisexuality | volume = 9 | issue = 3‚Äì4| pages = 259‚Äì78 | doi=10.1080/15299710903316562}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Flanders | first1 = Corey E. | last2 = Hatfield | first2 = Elaine | year = 2013 | title = Perceptions of Gender and Bisexuality: An Exploration of the Relationship Between Perceived Masculinity, Femininity, and Sexual Ambiguity | url = | journal = Journal of Bisexuality | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 374‚Äì89 | doi=10.1080/15299716.2013.813418}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, within queer cultures, marginalization and lack of full validation of bisexuality perpetuates an intra-queer discourse of queer embodiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Klesse | first1 = Christian | year = 2011 | title = Shady Characters, Untrustworthy Partners, and Promiscuous Sluts: Creating Bisexual Intimacies in the Face of Heteronormativity and Biphobia | url = | journal = Journal of Bisexuality | volume = 11 | issue = 2‚Äì3| pages = 227‚Äì44 | doi=10.1080/15299716.2011.571987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Obradors-Campos | first1 = Miguel | year = 2011 | title = Deconstructing Biphobia | url = | journal = Journal of Bisexuality | volume = 11 | issue = 2‚Äì3| pages = 207‚Äì26 | doi=10.1080/15299716.2011.571986}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a separation of bisexual legitimacy because of one's possible position to be in a heterosexual relationship. Bisexuality can be understood as a privilege in order to be accepted within normative structures of sexuality and human relations. This privileged position, within a hetero-normative framework of gender and sexuality, allows for the misrepresentation and inclusion of these experiences. A woman who is feminine and bisexual can "pass" as straight if presently engaged in hetero-normative/straight sexual acts. In this case, femininity acts as a privilege within the queer context.

The '''Gabo Reform''', also known as the '''Kabo Reform''', describes a series of sweeping reforms suggested to the government of [[Korea]] beginning in 1894 and ending in 1896 during the reign of [[Gojong of Korea]] in response to the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]]. Historians debate the degree of Japanese influence in this program,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} as well as its effect in encouraging modernization. The name Gabo (Í∞ëÏò§, Áî≤Âçà) comes from the name of the year 1894 in the traditional [[sexagenary cycle]].&lt;ref name="gabo nate"&gt;{{ko icon}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&amp;i=110660&amp;v=44 Gabo Reforms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610003901/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&amp;i=110660&amp;v=44 |date=2011-06-10 }} at Nate Britannica Korea&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The disarray and blatant corruption in the Korean government, particularly in the three main areas of revenues ‚Äì land tax, military service and the state granary system ‚Äì weighed heavily on the Korean peasantry which represented 90% of the population and was uniformly illiterate. Of special note is the corruption of the local functionaries (Hyangi) who could purchase an appointment as administrators and so cloak their predations on the farmers with an aura of officialdom. [[Yangban]] families, formerly well-respected for their status as a noble class, were increasingly seen as little more than commoners who were unwilling to meet their responsibilities to their communities. Faced with increasing corruption in the government, [[brigandage]] of the disenfranchised -(such as the mounted fire brigands, or ''Hwajok'', and the boat-borne water brigands or ''Sujok'')- as well as abuse by the military, many poor village folk sought to pool their resources such as land, tools and production in order to survive. Despite the government abolishing slavery and burning the records in 1801, increasing numbers of peasants and farmers become involved in KYE or "mutual assistance associations". Institutions such as the Catholic and Protestant missions, with the egalitarian nature of their teachings garnered followings among the Yangban, though commonly in the more urban areas.

Arguably of greater influence were the religious teachings of Choi Che-u, (ÏµúÏ†úÏö∞, Â¥îÊøüÊÑö, 1824‚Äì1864) called [[Donghak]] or "Eastern Learning" which became especially popular in rural areas. Themes of Exclusionism (of foreign influences), Nationalism, Salvation and Social Consciousness were set to music allowing illiterate farmers to understand and accept them more readily. Choe, as well as many Koreans, was also alarmed by the intrusion of Christianity and the Anglo-French occupation of Beijing during the 2nd Opium War. He believed that the best way to counter foreign influence in Korea was to introduce democratic and human rights reforms internally. Nationalism and social reform struck a chord among the peasant guerrillas, and [[Donghak]] spread all across Korea. Progressive revolutionaries organized the peasants into a cohesive structure. Arrested in 1863 following the Chinju Uprising led by YU Kye-cheun, Choe was charged with "misleading the people and sowing discord in society". Choe was executed in 1864, sending many of his followers into hiding in the mountains and leaving the Korean populace to continue to suffer.

[[Gojong of Korea|King Kojong]] (r. 1864-1910), enthroned at the age of twelve, succeeded [[Cheoljong of Joseon|King Cheolchong]] (r. 1849 - 1863). King Kojong's father, [[Heungseon Daewongun]](Yi Ha-Ung; 1820-1898), ruled as the de facto regent and inaugurated far-ranging reform to strengthen the central administration.  Among his targeted reforms was addressing the inherited rule by a few elite ruling families by the adoption of a merit system for official appointments. In addition, [Seowon] (private academies), which threatened to develop a parallel system to the corrupt government and enjoyed special privileges and large land-holdings, were repressed through taxes despite bitter opposition from Confucian scholars. The decision to rebuild palace buildings and finance it through additional levies on the population caused [[Heungseon Daewongun]]'s attempted reforms to antagonize the three largest constituencies supporting the government: the ruling elite, the Confucian scholars and the general population. [[Heungseon Daewongun]] was impeached in 1873 and forced into retirement by the supporters of [[Empress Myeongseong]].

On 27 February 1876, the [[Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1876]], also known in Japan as the Japanese-Korea Treaty of Amity (Japanese language: Êó•Êúù‰øÆÂ•ΩÊù°Ë¶è Nitch≈ç-sh≈´k≈çj≈çki, Korean language: Í∞ïÌôîÎèÑÏ°∞ÏïΩ Ê±üËèØÂ≥∂Ê¢ùÁ¥Ñ Ganghwado joyak) was signed. It was designed to open up Korea to Japanese trade, and the rights granted to Japan under the treaty were similar to those granted Western powers in Japan following the visit of Commodore Perry in 1854.[9]. However, the treaty ended Korea's status as a protectorate of China, forced open three Korean ports to Japanese trade, granted extraterritorial rights to Japanese citizens and was an unequal treaty signed under duress of the [[Unyo Incident|Unyo Incident of 1875]] (gunboat diplomacy).[9] Daewongun remained opposed to any concessions to Japan or the West, helped organize the Mutiny of 1882 [[Imo Incident]], an anti-Japanese outbreak against the Empress and her allies.&lt;ref name="Marius B.

Daewongun was restored to power briefly, only to be forcibly taken to China by Chinese troops dispatched to [[Seoul]] to prevent further disorder.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt; In August 1882, the Treaty of Chemulpo ([[Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1882]]) idemnified the families of the Japanese victims, paid reparation to the Japanese government in the amount of 500,000 yen and allowed a company of Japanese guards to be stationed at the Japanese legation in Seoul.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt;

The struggle between Heungseon Daewongun's followers and those of Empress Myeongseong was further complicated by competition from a Korean independence faction known as the Progressive Party (Kaehwadang) as well as Conservative faction. While the former sought Japan's support, the latter sought China's support.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt; On 4 December 1884, the Korean independence group, assisted by the Japanese, attempted a coup (Kapsin Chongbyon; Coup d'√âtat of 1884) and established a pro-Japanese government under the reigning king, dedicated to the independence of Korea from Chinese suzerainty.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt; However, this proved short-lived, as conservative Korean officials requested the help of Chinese forces stationed in Korea.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt; The coup was put down by Chinese troops, and a Korean mob killed both Japanese officers and Japanese residents in retaliation.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt; Some leaders of the independence faction, including [[Kim Okgyun]], fled to Japan, while others were executed.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt;

== Donghak revolution, and first Sino-Japanese war, 1894 ==
{{Main|Donghak Peasant Revolution|First Sino-Japanese War}}

The outbreak of the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]] in 1894 provided a seminal pretext for direct military intervention by Japan in the affairs of Korea. Seeking redress of long-standing hardship and corruption disparate factions among the Korean peasant population coalesced into a militant force and revolted against the Korean administration. In April, 1894 the Korean government asked for Chinese assistance in ending the Donghak Peasant Revolt. In response Japanese leaders, citing a violation of Convention of Tientsin as a pretext, decided upon military intervention to challenge China. China requested Japan withdraw her troops, Japan refused and proposed that the Qing and Japan co-ordinate to reform the Korean government. The Qing refused. On May 3, 1894, 1,500 Qing Dynasty forces appeared in Incheon. The same day, 6,000 Japanese forces also landed in Incheon leading to the Sino-Japanese War.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Japan deposed the Korean government and installed a new government which demanded the Qing leave, and began a programme of reform. Japan won the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], and China signed the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] in 1895. Among its many stipulations, the treaty recognized "the full and complete independence and autonomy of Korea," thus ending Korea's [[Tributary state|tributary]] relationship with the Chinese Qing Dynasty, leading to the proclamation of full independence of Joseon Korea in 1895. At the same time, Japan suppressed the Donghak Revolution with Korean government forces. Though the revolt had been ended, the issues and complaints of the Korean peasant population remained unaddressed.

==Reforms==
The reforms were done largely in three stages, according to the changing members of the reform council and the involvement of Japan. There were three stages of development.

===First reforms===
The first reforms took place from July to October 1894, based on the original reform bill presented by Japanese ambassador [[≈åtori Keisuke|Otori Keisuke (Â§ßÈ≥•Âú≠‰ªã)]], that had been previously refused by the [[Joseon]] court and [[Qing dynasty]].&lt;ref name="gabo doosan"/&gt; As Japan was focused more on the Sino-Japanese War, many of the first reforms reflected the desired reforms of the progressive council members and some of the reforms demanded by the peasants of the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]] did not go undenied.&lt;ref name="gabo nate"/&gt; The deliberate Council passed 210 reform bills by Kim Hongjip. At the first stage of reform, there was little interference from Japan.

Two-hundred and ten articles were established, most notably the restructuring of central government by greatly reducing the king's responsibilities and placing more power in the ''[[State Council of Joseon|Uijeongbu]]''. The ''gwageo'' system was abolished and replaced by a Japanese bureaucratic system. The administration of financial affairs were centralized, the taxation system redressed, a new monetary system allowed the use of Japanese currency, and the measurement system was changed to that of Japan.&lt;ref name="gabo doosan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gabo ktta"/&gt; 
Other social reforms were addressed as well; discrimination based on the class system, slavery, underage marriage were all banned and widows were granted the right to remarry. These reforms would legally change the traditional feudal system that had been followed for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name="gabo nate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gabo doosan"/&gt;

===Second reforms===
The second state of reform took place from December 1894 to July 1895. Japan closed down the ''Gunguk Gimucheo'' in December 1894 as the outcome of the Sino-Japanese War was leaning to their favor and set up a new coalition cabinet consisting of Kim Hongjip and Park Younghyo. The cabinet presented a new law, ''Hongbeom 14jo'' (ÌôçÎ≤î 14Ï°∞, "Exemplary Rules" 14 articles), which proclaimed the severance of the subordinate relationship with China, abolishment of nepotism in government, restructure of government offices and their duties. With this law as foundation, 213 new articles were created.&lt;ref name="gabo nate"/&gt;
The names of ''[[State Council of Joseon|Uijeongbu]]'' and its subsidiaries were changed to the modern ''naegak'' (ÎÇ¥Í∞Å, cabinet) and ''bu'' (Î∂Ä, department). Administrative districts were reorganized to 23 ''bu''(Î∂Ä, region) and 337 ''gun''(Íµ∞, district). New financial bureaus were installed throughout the nation to overlook tax affairs, military and police systems were rehauled and modernized, judicial systems were changed with new courthouse and judiciary laws.&lt;ref name="gabo daum"&gt;{{ko icon}} [http://enc.daum.net/dic100/contents.do?query1=b01g1339a Gabo Reforms] at Daum Britannica Korea&lt;/ref&gt;

The second reform measures were halted when Park Young Hyo, who had been at the center of the reform efforts, fled to Japan after being accused of conspiracy to treason by those who were against the reformations that were taking place.&lt;ref name="gabo nate"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ko icon}} Kang Junman (Í∞ïÏ§ÄÎßå), ''Walk through Korea's Modern History 2'' (ÌïúÍµ≠Í∑ºÎåÄÏÇ¨ÏÇ∞Ï±Ö 2) p291, [http://inmul.co.kr/ Inmul Publishing Co.(Ïù∏Î¨ºÍ≥º ÏÇ¨ÏÉÅÏÇ¨)], Seoul, 2007. {{ISBN|978-89-5906-072-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assassination of Queen Min, 1895 ===
{{Main|Empress Myeongseong}}

The documents included the testimony of King Gojong, several witnesses of the assassination, and [[Karl Ivanovich Weber]]'s report to [[Aleksey Lobanov-Rostovsky]], the Foreign Minister of Russia. Weber was the [[charg√© d'affaires]] at the Russian legation in Seoul at that time.&lt;ref name="Dong-a 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.donga.com/docs/magazine/shin/2004/11/09/200411090500053/200411090500053_1.html |script-title=ko:ÏùºÎ≥∏Ïù∏ Ìè≠ÎèÑÍ∞Ä Í∞ÄÏä¥ÏùÑ ÏÑ∏ Î≤à ÏßìÎ∞üÍ≥† ÏùºÎ≥∏ÎèÑÎ°ú ÎÇúÏûêÌñàÎã§ |publisher=[[Dong-a Ilbo]] |author=Park Jong-hyo (Î∞ïÏ¢ÖÌö®), former professor at [[Lomonosov Moscow State University]] |date= 2002-01-01 |issue= 508 |pages=472 ~ 485|language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Russian eyewitness, Seredin-Sabatin (–°–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∏–Ω-C–∞–±–∞—Ç–∏–Ω), an employee of the Korean king, a group of Japanese agents entered [[Gyeongbokgung]],&lt;ref&gt;See Russian eyewitness account of surrounding circumstances at {{cite web|url=http://koreaweb.ws/ks/ksr/queenmin.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012005946/http://koreaweb.ws/ks/ksr/queenmin.txt |archivedate=2012-10-12 |df= }} by [[Gari Ledyard]], Sejong Professor of Korean History Emeritus at [[Columbia University]]&lt;/ref&gt; killed Queen Min and desecrated her body in the north wing of the palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tatiana |last=Simbirtseva |coauthors= |title=Queen Min of Korea: Coming to Power |date=1996-05-08 |publisher= |url=http://www.gkn-la.net/history_resources/queen_min_tmsimbirtseva_1996.htm |work= |pages= |accessdate=2007-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217083556/http://www.gkn-la.net/history_resources/queen_min.htm |archivedate=2006-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he heard the news, [[Heungseon Daewongun]] returned to the royal palace the same day.&lt;ref name="Dong-a 2002"/&gt; On 11 February 1896, King Gojong and the crown prince moved from Gyeongbokgung to the [[Russia]]n legation in [[Jeong-dong]], Seoul, from where they governed for about one year, an event known as the [[Korea royal refuge at the Russian legation]]. After returning to the royal palace, the royal family was still guarded by Russian guards.

In the midst of disarray in Joseon politics at this time, a series of [[Seonbi]] scholars mobilized volunteers to fight against the external foreign influence on the government. This also led to the uprising of the Eulmi temporary armies aimed at avenging the assassination of Queen Min.

===Third reforms===
Spurred greatly by the assassination of the queen and subsequent unrest, the government, then led by a new progressive cabinet headed by [[Kim Hong-jip]] and [[Yu Kil-chun]], carried out reforms from October 1895 to February 1896.{{sfn|Kang|2006|p=483}}&lt;ref name="gabo doosan"&gt;{{ko icon}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=4790 Gabo Reforms] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gabo ktta"&gt;''Korea through the Ages Vol. 2'' p40-p43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books id=XB4UYXNQK1wC&amp;pg=PA483&amp;lpg=PA483&amp;dq=Gabo+reforms+Kim+Hong+jip&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8Y64Oh8n2h&amp;sig=WaF0OZsvJAANg-ispTdZ6V_Be3c&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; A special reform body, ''Gunguk Gimucheo'' (Íµ∞Íµ≠Í∏∞Î¨¥Ï≤ò, Deliberative Council), was created to establish rules.&lt;ref name="gabo ktta"/&gt; Their policies resulted in the official discarding of the [[lunar calendar]] in favor of the modern Gregorian [[solar calendar]], the official designation of [[regnal years]] independent of the Chinese tradition, the creation of a [[mail|postal service]], the introduction of primary schools and a new educational system&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2010/04/181_24875.html Gabo Reforms], [[Korea Times]], 2008-05-28. Retrieved 2010-06-23&lt;/ref&gt; and the renewal of the military system.&lt;ref name="gabo doosan"/&gt;

The most controversial reform at this time was the proclamation of the "Short Hair Act" ({{korean|hangul=Îã®Î∞úÎ†π|hanja=Êñ∑È´Æ‰ª§}}), i.e. cutting off the traditional Korean male sangtu and reformation of traditional attire. It triggered many protests among the people, most notably the conservative scholars, who were already disillusioned by the pro-Japanese cabinet. They had created the [[Righteous Army]] and had actively protested nationwide; protests which escalated after the assassination of Empress Myeongseong in 1895. After King Gojong and the [[Sunjong of Korea|Crown Prince]] fled for refuge to the [[Korea royal refuge at the Russian legation|Russian legation]] in 1896, this opposition resulted in the murders of Kim Hongjip and other cabinet members, and the reformations came to an end.{{sfn|Kang|2006|p=483}}&lt;ref name="gabo nate"/&gt;

===Main provisions of the Gabo Reform===
The Gabo Reform was similar to the [[Meiji Restoration]] in [[Japan]] and produced the following sweeping changes and declarations:&lt;ref name="gabo ktta"/&gt;
# Korea is a sovereign country (i.e., completely independent from [[China]]'s external interference).
# Hierarchical society ([[social class|class]] system) is abolished. Social privileges of the yangban class are eliminated.
# Those with talent are to be allowed to study and appointed to government posts based on merit alone, regardless of social class.
# The army is to be established on the basis of conscription, regardless of background. A modern police force and military are established.
# All official documents are to be written in [[Hangul]], and not [[hanja]] (Chinese characters).
# [[Tanning (leather)|Leather working]], [[acting]], and so on are to no longer be regarded as degrading work, and the people who do them are no longer outcastes. 
# A sound system of fiscal management and to use the government's fiscal resources to create wealth for the country is developed.
# Torture of suspects and witnesses was banned, guilt by association ended (punishment of family members of criminals)
# End of merchant monopolies
# Ban of sale of slaves from 1886 confirmed, and all forms of [[slavery in Korea|legal slavery]] ended
# Marriage age raised to twenty for men, sixteen for women (outlawing child marriage)

=== Protests for democracy and the proclamation of Korean Empire, 1896-1898 ===
{{Main|Independence Club|Korean Empire}}
After the Royal Refuge, some Korean activists established the [[Independence Club]] (ÎèÖÎ¶ΩÌòëÌöå, Áç®Á´ãÂçîÊúÉ) in 1896. They claimed that Korea should negotiate with Western powers, particularly Russia, to counterbalance the growing influence of Japan and Russia. This club had contributed to the construction of [[Independence Gate]], and they held regular meetings at the [[Jongno]] streets, demanding [[democracy|democratic]] reforms as Korea became a constitutional monarchy, and an end to Japanese and Russian influence in Korean affairs. In October 1897, King Gojong decided to return to his other palace, [[Deoksugung]], and proclaimed the founding of the [[Korean Empire]]. During this period, the Korean government conducted a westernization policy. It was not an enduring reform, however, and the Independence Club was dissolved on 25 December 1898 as [[Emperor Gojong]] officially announced a prohibition on unofficial congresses.

{{About|the epic poem}}
{{Trojan War}}
{{Italic title}}
The '''''Iliad''''' ({{IPAc-en|Àà|…™|l|i|…ô|d}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Iliad "Iliad"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc|·º∏ŒªŒπŒ¨œÇ}} ''{{transl|grc|Ili√°s}}'', {{IPA-el|iÀê.li.√°s|pron}} in [[Attic Greek|Classical Attic]]; sometimes referred to as the '''''Song of Ilion''''' or '''''Song of Ilium''''') is an [[ancient Greek]]  [[epic poem]] in [[dactylic hexameter]], traditionally attributed to [[Homer]]. Set during the [[Trojan War]], the ten-year [[siege]] of the city of [[Troy]] (Ilium) by a coalition of Greek states, it tells of the battles and events during the weeks of a quarrel between King [[Agamemnon]] and the warrior [[Achilles]].

Although the story covers only a few weeks in the final year of the war, the ''Iliad'' mentions or alludes to many of the Greek legends about the siege; the earlier events, such as the gathering of [[warriors]] for the siege, the cause of the [[war]], and related concerns tend to appear near the beginning. Then the epic narrative takes up events prophesied for the future, such as Achilles' imminent death and the fall of Troy, although the narrative ends before these events take place. However, as these events are prefigured and alluded to more and more vividly, when it reaches an end the poem has told a more or less complete tale of the Trojan War.

The ''Iliad'' is paired with something of a [[sequel]], the ''[[Odyssey]]'', also attributed to Homer. Along with the ''Odyssey'', the ''Iliad'' is among the oldest extant works of [[Western literature]], and its written version is usually dated to around the 8th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Vidal-Naquet|Vidal-Naquet, Pierre]]. ''Le monde d'Hom√®re'' (The World of Homer), Perrin (2000), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern vulgate (the standard accepted version), the ''Iliad'' contains 15,693 lines; it is written in [[Homeric Greek]], a literary amalgam of [[Ionic Greek]] and other [[Ancient Greek dialects|dialects]]. According to [[Michael N. Nagler]], the ''Iliad'' is a more complicated epic poem than the ''Odyssey''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14932229|title=Approaches to teaching Homer's Iliad and Odyssey|date=1987|publisher=Modern Language Association of America|others=Myrsiades, Kostas., Modern Language Association of America.|isbn=0873524993|location=New York|oclc=14932229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[File:Beginning Iliad.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The first verses of the ''Iliad'']]
:''Note: Book numbers are in parentheses and come before the synopsis of the book.''

({{Iliad|en|1}}) After an [[invocation]] to the [[Muse]]s, the story launches ''[[in medias res]]'' towards the end of the Trojan War between the Trojans and the besieging [[Greeks]]. [[Chryses]], a Trojan priest of [[Apollo]], offers the Greeks wealth for the return of his daughter [[Chryseis]], held captive of [[Agamemnon]], the Greek leader. Although most of the Greek army is in favour of the offer, Agamemnon refuses. Chryses &lt;!--THIS IS NOT A TYPO--&gt; prays for Apollo's help, and Apollo causes a plague to afflict the Greek army.

After nine days of plague, [[Achilles]], the leader of the [[Myrmidons|Myrmidon]] contingent, calls an assembly to deal with the problem. Under pressure, Agamemnon agrees to return Chryseis to her father, but decides to take Achilles' captive, [[Briseis | Brisƒì√≠s]], as compensation. Angered, Achilles declares that he and his men will no longer fight for Agamemnon and will go home. [[Odysseus]] takes a ship and returns Chryseis to her father, whereupon Apollo ends the plague.

In the meantime, Agamemnon's messengers take Briseis away. Achilles becomes very upset, sits by the seashore, and prays to his mother, [[Thetis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Homer|title=The Iliad|page=115|publisher= Norton Books|location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achilles asks his mother to ask [[Zeus]] to bring the Greeks to the breaking point by the Trojans, so Agamemnon will realize how much the Greeks need Achilles. Thetis does so, and Zeus agrees.

({{Iliad|en|2}}) Zeus sends a dream to Agamemnon, urging him to attack Troy. Agamemnon heeds the dream but decides to first test the Greek army's morale, by telling them to go home. The plan backfires, and only the intervention of Odysseus, inspired by [[Athena]], stops a rout.

Odysseus confronts and beats [[Thersites]], a common soldier who voices discontent about fighting Agamemnon's war. After a meal, the Greeks deploy in companies upon the Trojan plain. The poet takes the opportunity to describe the provenance of each Greek contingent.

When news of the Greek deployment reaches King [[Priam]], the Trojans too sortie upon the plain. In a list similar to that for the Greeks, the poet describes the Trojans and their allies.

({{Iliad|en|3}}) The armies approach each other, but before they meet, [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] offers to end the war by fighting a duel with [[Menelaus]], urged by his brother and head of the Trojan army, [[Hector]]. While [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] tells Priam about the Greek commanders from the walls of Troy, both sides swear a truce and promise to abide by the outcome of the duel. Paris is beaten, but [[Aphrodite]] rescues him and leads him to bed with Helen before Menelaus can kill him.

({{Iliad|en|4}}) Pressured by [[Hera]]'s hatred of Troy, Zeus arranges for the Trojan [[Pandarus|Pandaros]] to break the truce by wounding Menelaus with an arrow. Agamemnon rouses the Greeks, and battle is joined.

({{Iliad|en|5}}) In the fighting, [[Diomedes]] kills many Trojans, including Pandaros, and defeats [[Aeneas]], whom Aphrodite rescues, but Diomedes attacks and wounds the goddess. Apollo faces Diomedes and warns him against warring with gods. Many heroes and commanders join in, including [[Hector]], and the gods supporting each side try to influence the battle. Emboldened by Athena, Diomedes wounds [[Ares]] and puts him out of action.

({{Iliad|en|6}}) Hector rallies the Trojans and prevents a rout; the Greek Diomedes and the Trojan [[Glaucus (soldier)|Glaukos]] find common ground and exchange unequal gifts. Hector enters the city, urges prayers and sacrifices, incites Paris to battle, bids his wife [[Andromache]] and son [[Astyanax]] farewell on the city walls, and rejoins the battle.

({{Iliad|en|7}}) Hector duels with [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]], but nightfall interrupts the fight, and both sides retire. The Greeks agree to burn their dead, and build a wall to protect their ships and camp, while the Trojans quarrel about returning Helen. Paris offers to return the treasure he took and give further wealth as compensation, but not Helen, and the offer is refused.
A day's truce is agreed for burning the dead, during which the Greeks also build their wall and a trench.

({{Iliad|en|8}}) The next morning, Zeus prohibits the gods from interfering, and fighting begins anew. The Trojans prevail and force the Greeks back to their wall, while Hera and Athena are forbidden to help. Night falls before the Trojans can assail the Greek wall. They camp in the field to attack at first light, and their watchfires light the plain like stars.

[[File:Iliad VIII 245-253 in cod F205, Milan, Biblioteca Ambrosiana, late 5c or early 6c.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''Iliad'', Book VIII, lines 245‚Äì53, Greek manuscript, late 5th, early 6th centuries AD.]]
({{Iliad|en|9}}) Meanwhile, the Greeks are desperate. Agamemnon admits his error, and sends an embassy composed of Odysseus, Ajax, [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]], and two heralds to offer Briseis and extensive gifts to Achilles, who has been camped next to his ships throughout, if only he will return to the fighting. Achilles and his companion [[Patroclus]] receive the embassy well, but Achilles angrily refuses Agamemnon's offer and declares that he would only return to battle if the Trojans reached his ships and threatened them with fire. The embassy returns empty-handed.

({{Iliad|en|10}}) Later that night, Odysseus and Diomedes venture out to the Trojan lines, kill the Trojan [[Dolon (mythology)|Dolon]], and wreak havoc in the camps of some [[Thracian]] allies of Troy's.

({{Iliad|en|11}}) In the morning, the fighting is fierce, and Agamemnon, Diomedes, and Odysseus are all wounded. Achilles sends Patroclus from his camp to inquire about the Greek casualties, and while there Patroclus is moved to pity by a speech of [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]]'s.

({{Iliad|en|12}}) The Trojans attack the Greek wall on foot. Hector, ignoring an omen, leads the terrible fighting. The Greeks are overwhelmed and routed, the wall's gate is broken, and Hector charges in.

({{Iliad|en|13}}) Many fall on both sides. The Trojan seer [[Polydamas (Iliad)|Polydamas]] urges Hector to fall back and warns him about Achilles, but is ignored.

({{Iliad|en|14}}) Hera [[seduce]]s Zeus and lures him to sleep, allowing [[Poseidon]] to help the Greeks, and the Trojans are driven back onto the plain.

({{Iliad|en|15}}) Zeus awakes and is enraged by Poseidon's intervention. Against the mounting discontent of the Greek-supporting gods, Zeus sends Apollo to aid the Trojans, who once again breach the wall, and the battle reaches the ships.

({{Iliad|en|16}}) Patroclus cannot stand to watch any longer and begs Achilles to be allowed to defend the ships. Achilles relents and lends Patroclus his armor, but sends him off with a stern admonition not to pursue the Trojans, lest he take Achilles' glory. Patroclus leads the [[Myrmidons]] into battle and arrives as the Trojans set fire to the first ships. The Trojans are routed by the sudden onslaught, and Patroclus begins his assault by killing Zeus's son [[Sarpedon]], a leading ally of the Trojans. Patroclus, ignoring Achilles' command, pursues and reaches the gates of Troy, where Apollo himself stops him. Patroclus is set upon by Apollo and [[Euphorbos]], and is finally killed by Hector.

({{Iliad|en|17}}) Hector takes Achilles' armor from the fallen Patroclus, but fighting develops around Patroclus' body.

({{Iliad|en|18}}) Achilles is mad with grief when he hears of Patroclus' death and vows to take vengeance on Hector; his mother Thetis grieves, too, knowing that Achilles is fated to die young if he kills Hector. Achilles is urged to help retrieve Patroclus' body but has no armour. Bathed in a brilliant radiance by Athena, Achilles stands next to the Greek wall and roars in rage. The Trojans are dismayed by his appearance, and the Greeks manage to bear Patroclus' body away. Polydamas urges Hector again to withdraw into the city; again Hector refuses, and the Trojans camp on the plain at nightfall. Patroclus is mourned. Meanwhile, at Thetis' request, [[Hephaestus]] fashions a new set of armor for Achilles, including a [[Shield of Achilles|magnificently wrought shield]].

({{Iliad|en|19}}) In the morning, Agamemnon gives Achilles all the promised gifts, including Briseis, but Achilles is indifferent to them. Achilles fasts while the Greeks take their meal, straps on his new armor, and heaves{{clarify|date=September 2016}} his great spear. His horse [[Balius and Xanthus|Xanthos]] prophesies to Achilles his death. Achilles drives his chariot into battle.

({{Iliad|en|20}}) [[Zeus]] lifts the ban on the gods' interference, and the gods freely help both sides. Achilles, burning with rage and grief, slays many.

({{Iliad|en|21}}) Driving the Trojans before him, Achilles cuts off half their number in the river [[Scamander|Skamandros]] and proceeds to slaughter them, filling the river with the dead. The river, angry at the killing, confronts Achilles but is beaten back by Hephaestus' firestorm. The gods fight among themselves. The great gates of the city are opened to receive the fleeing Trojans, and Apollo leads Achilles away from the city by pretending to be a Trojan.

({{Iliad|en|22}}) When Apollo reveals himself to Achilles, the Trojans have retreated into the city, all except for Hector, who, having twice ignored the counsels of Polydamas, feels the shame of the rout and resolves to face Achilles, despite the pleas of his parents, Priam and [[Hecuba]]. When Achilles approaches, Hector's will fails him, and he is chased around the city by Achilles. Finally, Athena tricks him into stopping, and he turns to face his opponent.  After a brief duel, Achilles stabs Hector through the neck.  Before dying, Hector reminds Achilles that he, too, is fated to die in the war. Achilles takes Hector's body and dishonours it by dragging it behind his chariot.

({{Iliad|en|23}}) The ghost of Patroclus comes to Achilles in a dream, urging him to carry out his burial rites and to arrange for their bones to be entombed together. The Greeks hold a day of funeral games, and Achilles gives out the prizes.

({{Iliad|en|24}}) Dismayed by Achilles' continued abuse of Hector's body, Zeus decides that it must be returned to Priam. Led by [[Hermes]], Priam takes a wagon out of Troy, across the plains, and into the Greek camp unnoticed. He clasps Achilles by the knees and begs for his son's body. Achilles is moved to tears, and the two lament their losses in the war. After a meal, Priam carries Hector's body back into Troy. Hector is buried, and the city mourns.

Much debate has surrounded the nature of the relationship of Achilles and Patroclus, as to whether it can be described as a homoerotic one or not. Classical and Hellenistic Athenian scholars perceived it as [[pederasty|pederastic]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschylus]] does portray it so in Fragment 134a.&lt;/ref&gt; while others perceived it as a platonic warrior-bond.&lt;ref&gt;Hornblower, S. and Spawforth, A.

===Gods===
In the literary [[Trojan War]] of the ''Iliad'', the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods, goddesses, and minor deities]] fight among themselves and participate in human warfare, often by interfering with humans to counter other gods. Unlike their portrayals in Greek religion, Homer's portrayal of gods suited his narrative purpose. The gods in traditional thought of fourth-century Athenians were not spoken of in terms familiar to us from Homer.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Honor Thy Gods: Popular Religion in Greek Tragedy|last=Mikalson|first=Jon|publisher=Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Classical-era historian [[Herodotus]] says that Homer and [[Hesiod]], his contemporary, were the first writers to name and describe the gods' appearance and character.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ablemedia.com/ctcweb/netshots/homer.htm Homer's Iliad], Classical Technology Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Greek Gods Human Lives: What We Can Learn From Myths'', [[Mary Lefkowitz]] discusses the relevance of divine action in the ''Iliad'', attempting to answer the question of whether or not divine intervention is a discrete occurrence (for its own sake), or if such godly behaviors are mere human character metaphors. The intellectual interest of Classic-era authors, such as [[Thucydides]] and [[Plato]], was limited to their utility as "a way of talking about human life rather than a description or a truth", because, if the gods remain religious figures, rather than human metaphors, their "existence"‚Äîwithout the foundation of either dogma or ''a'' bible of faiths‚Äîthen allowed Greek culture the intellectual breadth and freedom to conjure gods fitting any religious function they required as a people.&lt;ref&gt;Lefkowitz, Mary. ''Greek Gods, Human Lives: What We Can Learn From Myths'' (2003) New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taplin, Oliver. "Bring Back the Gods", ''The New York Times'' 14 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The religion had no founder and was not the creation of an inspired teacher which were popular origins of existing religions in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion:A Study in Survivals|last=Lawson|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|page=2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individuals were free to believe what they wanted, as the Greek religion was created out of a consensus of the people. These beliefs coincide to the thoughts about the gods in polytheistic Greek religion. In the article "Greek Religion" A.W.H. Adkins, agrees with this by saying, ‚ÄúThe early Greeks personalized every aspect of their world, natural and cultural, and their experiences in it. The earth, the sea, the mountains, the rivers, custom-law (themis), and one‚Äôs share in society and its goods were all seen in personal as well as naturalistic terms.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Greek-religion|title=Greek religion {{!}} ancient religion|newspaper=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this thinking, each god or goddess in Polytheistic Greek religion is attributed to an aspect of the human world. For example, [[Poseidon]] is the god of the sea, [[Aphrodite]] is the goddess of beauty, [[Ares]] is the god of war, and so on and so forth for many other gods. This is how Greek culture was defined as many Athenians felt the presence of their gods through divine intervention in significant events in their lives. Oftentimes they found these events to be mysterious and inexplicable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In ''The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind'', psychologist [[Julian Jaynes]] uses the ''Iliad'' as a major piece of evidence for his theory of [[Bicameralism (psychology)|Bicameralism]], which posits that until about the time described in the ''Iliad'', humans had a much different mentality than present day humans. He says that humans during that time were lacking what we today call consciousness. He suggests that humans heard and obeyed commands from what they identified as gods, until the change in human mentality that incorporated the motivating force into the conscious self. He points out that almost every action in the ''Iliad'' is directed, caused, or influenced by a god, and that earlier translations show an astonishing lack of words suggesting thought, planning, or introspection. Those that do appear, he argues, are misinterpretations made by translators imposing a modern mentality on the characters.&lt;ref&gt;Jaynes, Julian. (1976) ''The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind''. p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Divine intervention ====
Some scholars believe that the gods may have intervened in the mortal world because of quarrels they may have had among each other. [[Homer]] interprets the world at this time by using the passion and emotion of the gods to be determining factors of what happens on the human level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kullmann|first=Wolfgang|date=1985-01-01|title=Gods and Men in the Iliad and the Odyssey|journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology|volume=89|pages=1‚Äì23|doi=10.2307/311265|jstor=311265}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of one of these relationships in the ''Iliad'' occurs between [[Athena]], [[Hera]], and Aphrodite. In the final book of the poem Homer writes, ‚ÄúHe offended Athena and Hera&amp;mdash;both goddesses.‚Äù&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Iliad|last=Homer|first=|last2=Fagles|first2=Robert|last3=Knox|first3=Bernard|publisher=New York, N.Y: Penguin Books|year=1998|isbn=|location=|page=589|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athena and Hera are envious of Aphrodite because of a beauty pageant on Mount Olympus in which [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] chose Aphrodite to be the most beautiful goddess over both Hera and Athena. Wolfgang Kullmann further goes on to say, ‚ÄúHera‚Äôs and Athena‚Äôs disappointment over the victory of Aphrodite in the Judgement of Paris determines the whole conduct of both goddesses in ''The Iliad'' and is the cause of their hatred for Paris, the Judge, and his town Troy.‚Äù&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hera and Athena then continue to support the Achaean forces throughout the poem because Paris is part of the Trojans, while Aphrodite aids Paris and the Trojans. The emotions between the goddesses often translate to actions they take in the mortal world. For example, in Book 3 of The Iliad, Paris challenges any of the Achaeans to a single combat and [[Menelaus]] steps forward. Menelaus was dominating the battle and was on the verge of killing Paris. ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôd have hauled him off and won undying glory but Aphrodite, Zeus‚Äôs daughter was quick to the mark, snapped the rawhide strap.‚Äù&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Aphrodite intervened out of her own self-interest to save Paris from the wrath of Menelaus because Paris had helped her to win the beauty pageant. The partisanship of Aphrodite towards Paris induces constant intervention by all of the gods, especially to give motivational speeches to their respective proteges, while often appearing in the shape of a human being they are familiar with.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This connection of emotions to actions is just one example out of many that occur throughout the poem.

===Fate===
[[Destiny|Fate]] ({{lang|grc|Œ∫ŒÆœÅ}}, ''kƒìr'', "fated death") propels most of the events of the ''Iliad''. Once set, gods and men abide it, neither truly able nor willing to contest it. How fate is set is unknown, but it is told by the [[Moerae|Fates]] and by [[Zeus]] through sending omens to seers such as [[Calchas]]. Men and their gods continually speak of heroic acceptance and cowardly avoidance of one's slated fate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1375344 Fate as presented in Homer's "The Iliad"], Everything2&lt;/ref&gt; Fate does not determine every action, incident, and occurrence, but it does determine the outcome of life‚Äîbefore killing him, Hector calls Patroclus a fool {{citation needed span|for cowardly avoidance of his fate, by attempting his defeat;|date=November 2016}} Patroclus retorts:
&lt;ref&gt;[http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/studyguide/homer.htm Iliad Study Guide], Brooklyn College {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205014548/http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/studyguide/homer.htm |date=December 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
No, deadly destiny, with the son of Leto, has killed me,&lt;br /&gt;
and of men it was Euphorbos; you are only my third slayer.&lt;br /&gt;
And put away in your heart this other thing that I tell you.&lt;br /&gt;
You yourself are not one who shall live long, but now already&lt;br /&gt;
death and powerful destiny are standing beside you,&lt;br /&gt;
to go down under the hands of Aiakos' great son, Achilleus.&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad''. Richmond Lattimore, translator. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1951). 16.849‚Äì54.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here, Patroclus alludes to fated death by Hector's hand, and Hector's fated death by Achilles's hand. Each accepts the outcome of his life, yet, no-one knows if the gods can alter fate. The first instance of this doubt occurs in Book XVI. Seeing Patroclus about to kill [[Sarpedon]], his mortal son, Zeus says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ah me, that it is destined that the dearest of men, Sarpedon,&lt;br /&gt;
must go down under the hands of Menoitios' son Patroclus.&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad''. Richmond Lattimore, translator. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1951). 16.433‚Äì34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

About his dilemma, Hera asks Zeus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Majesty, son of Kronos, what sort of thing have you spoken?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you wish to bring back a man who is mortal, one long since&lt;br /&gt;
doomed by his destiny, from ill-sounding death and release him?&lt;br /&gt;
Do it, then; but not all the rest of us gods shall approve you.&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad''. Richmond Lattimore, translator. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1951). 16.440‚Äì43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In deciding between losing a son or abiding fate, Zeus, King of the Gods, allows it. This motif recurs when he considers sparing Hector, whom he loves and respects. This time, it is Athene who challenges him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Father of the shining bolt, dark misted, what is this you said?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you wish to bring back a man who is mortal, one long since&lt;br /&gt;
doomed by his destiny, from ill-sounding death and release him?&lt;br /&gt;
Do it, then; but not all the rest of us gods shall approve you.&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad''. Richmond Lattimore, translator. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1951). 22.178‚Äì81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Again, Zeus appears capable of altering fate, but does not, deciding instead to abide set outcomes; yet, contrariwise, fate spares Aeneas, after Apollo convinces the over-matched Trojan to fight Achilles. Poseidon cautiously speaks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
But come, let us ourselves get him away from death, for fear&lt;br /&gt;
the son of Kronos may be angered if now Achilleus&lt;br /&gt;
kills this man. It is destined that he shall be the survivor,&lt;br /&gt;
that the generation of Dardanos shall not die&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad''. Richmond Lattimore, translator. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1951). 20.300‚Äì04.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Divinely aided, Aeneas escapes the wrath of Achilles and survives the Trojan War. Whether or not the gods can alter fate, they do abide it, despite its countering their human allegiances; thus, the mysterious origin of fate is a power beyond the gods. Fate implies the primeval, tripartite division of the world that Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades effected in deposing their father, [[Cronus]], for its dominion. Zeus took the Air and the Sky, Poseidon the Waters, and Hades the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]], the land of the dead‚Äîyet they share dominion of the Earth. Despite the earthly powers of the Olympic gods, only the Three Fates set the destiny of Man.

In forgoing his ''nostos'', he will earn the greater reward of ''kleos aphthiton'' ({{lang|grc|Œ∫ŒªŒ≠ŒøœÇ ·ºÑœÜŒ∏ŒπœÑŒøŒΩ}}, "fame imperishable").&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In the poem, ''aphthiton'' ({{lang|grc|·ºÑœÜŒ∏ŒπœÑŒøŒΩ}}, "imperishable") occurs five other times,&lt;ref&gt;II.46, V.724, XIII.22, XIV.238, XVIII.370&lt;/ref&gt; each occurrence denotes an object: Agamemnon's sceptre, the wheel of [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]]'s chariot, the house of Poseidon, the throne of Zeus, the house of [[Hephaestus]]. Translator [[Richmond Lattimore|Lattimore]] renders ''kleos aphthiton'' as ''forever immortal'' and as ''forever imperishable''‚Äîconnoting Achilles's mortality by underscoring his greater reward in returning to battle Troy.

Kleos is often given visible representation by the prizes won in battle. When Agamemnon takes Briseis from Achilles, he takes away a portion of the kleos he had earned.

Achilles' shield, crafted by Hephaestus and given to him by his mother Thetis, bears an image of stars in the centre. The stars conjure profound images of the place of a single man, no matter how heroic, in the perspective of the entire cosmos.

===Nostos===
''[[Nostos]]'' ({{lang|grc|ŒΩœåœÉœÑŒøœÇ}}, "homecoming") occurs seven times in the poem,&lt;ref&gt;{{Iliad|en|2|155}}, {{Iliad|en|2|251}}, {{Iliad|en|9|413}}, {{Iliad|en|9|434}}, {{Iliad|en|9|622}}, {{Iliad|en|10|509}}, {{Iliad|en|16|82}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it a minor theme in the Iliad itself.  Yet the concept of homecoming is much explored in other Ancient Greek literature, especially in the post-war homeward fortunes experienced by the Atreidae (Agamemnon and Menelaus), and Odysseus (see the ''[[Odyssey]]'').

===Pride===

''[[Pride]]'' drives the plot of the Iliad. The Greeks gather on the plain of Troy to wrest Helen from the Trojans. Though the majority of the Trojans would gladly return Helen to the Greeks, they defer to the pride of their prince, Alexandros, also known as Paris. Within this frame, Homer‚Äôs work begins. At the start of the Iliad, Agamemnon‚Äôs pride sets forth a chain of events that leads him to take from Achilles, Briseis, the girl that he had originally given Achilles in return for his martial prowess. Due to this slight, Achilles refuses to fight and asks his mother, Thetis, to make sure that Zeus causes the Greeks to suffer on the battlefield until Agamemnon comes to realize the harm he has done to Achilles. Achilles‚Äô pride allows him to beg Thetis for the deaths of his Greek friends and countrymen. When in Book 9 his friends urge him to return, offering him loot and his girl, Briseis, he refuses, stuck in his vengeful pride. Achilles remains stuck until the very end, when his anger at himself for Patroclus‚Äô death overcomes his pride at Agamemnon‚Äôs slight and he returns to kill Hector. He overcomes his pride again when he keeps his anger in check and returns Hector to Priam at epic‚Äôs close. From epic start to epic finish, pride drives the plot.&lt;ref&gt;In ‚ÄúAn Origin of a Theory: A Comparison of Ethos in the Homeric Iliad with That Found in Aristotle‚Äôs Rhetoric.‚Äù Rhetoric Review, vol. 22, no. 1, 2003, pp. 16-30, T.S. Frobish writes that the war starts with his pride and immaturity, yet is finished with his skill and bravery on the battlefield‚Äù (24).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tim√™===
Akin to ''kleos'' is ''tim√™'' ({{lang|grc|œÑŒπŒºŒÆ}}, "respect, honor"), the concept denoting the respectability an honorable man accrues with accomplishment (cultural, political, martial), per his station in life. In Book I, the Greek troubles begin with King Agamemnon's dishonorable, unkingly behavior‚Äîfirst, by threatening the priest Chryses (1.11), then, by aggravating them in disrespecting Achilles, by confiscating Briseis from him (1.171). The warrior's consequent rancor against the dishonorable king ruins the Greek military cause.

===Hybris===

''Hybris'' (''·ΩùŒ≤œÅŒπœÇ'') plays a part similar to ''tim√™.'' The epic takes as its thesis the anger of Achilles and the destruction it brings. Anger disturbs the distance between human beings and the gods. Uncontrolled anger destroys orderly social relationships and upsets the balance of correct actions necessary to keep the gods away from human beings. (footnote Thompson). Despite the epic‚Äôs focus on Achilles‚Äô rage, hybris plays a prominent role also, serving as both kindling and fuel for many destructive events. Agamemnon refuses to ransom Chriseis up out of hybris and harms Achilles‚Äô pride when he demands Briseis. Hybris forces Paris to fight against Menelaus. Agamemnon spurs the Greeks to fight, by calling into question Odysseus, Diomedes, and Nestor‚Äôs pride, asking why they were cowering and waiting for help when they should be the ones leading the charge. While the events of the Iliad focus on the Achilles‚Äô rage and the destruction it brings on, hybris fuels and stokes them both.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Diane P. ‚ÄúAchilles‚Äô Wrath and the Plan of Zeus.‚Äù&lt;/ref&gt;

===Menis===
[[File:Wrath of Achilles2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|''The Wrath of Achilles'' (1819), by Michel Drolling.]]

The poem's initial word, {{lang|grc|Œº·øÜŒΩŒπŒΩ}} (''mƒìnin'', [[accusative]] of {{lang|grc|Œº·øÜŒΩŒπœÇ}}, ''mƒìnis'', "wrath, rage, fury"), establishes the ''Iliad's'' principal theme: The "Wrath of Achilles".&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, W.H.D. ''The Iliad'' (1938) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; His personal rage and wounded soldier's vanity propel the story: the Greeks' faltering in battle, the slayings of Patroclus and Hector, and the fall of Troy. In Book I, the Wrath of Achilles first emerges in the Achilles-convoked meeting, between the Greek kings and the seer [[Calchas]]. King Agamemnon dishonours Chryses, the Trojan priest of Apollo, by refusing with a threat the restitution of his daughter, Chryseis‚Äîdespite the proffered ransom of "gifts beyond count".&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad'', Richmond Lattimore, translator. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1951). 1.13.&lt;/ref&gt; The insulted priest prays his god's help, and a nine-day rain of divine plague arrows falls upon the Greeks. Moreover, in that meeting, Achilles accuses Agamemnon of being "greediest for gain of all men".&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad'', Richmond Lattimore, translator. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1951). 1.122.&lt;/ref&gt; To that, Agamemnon replies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
But here is my threat to you.&lt;br /&gt;
Even as Phoibos Apollo is taking away my Chryseis.&lt;br /&gt;
I shall convey her back in my own ship, with my own&lt;br /&gt;
followers; but I shall take the fair-cheeked Briseis,&lt;br /&gt;
your prize, I myself going to your shelter, that you may learn well&lt;br /&gt;
how much greater I am than you, and another man may shrink back&lt;br /&gt;
from likening himself to me and contending against me.&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad''. Richmond Lattimore, translator. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1951). 1.181‚Äì87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After that, only Athena stays Achilles's wrath. He vows to never again obey orders from Agamemnon. Furious, Achilles cries to his mother, Thetis, who persuades Zeus's divine intervention‚Äîfavouring the Trojans‚Äîuntil Achilles's rights are restored. Meanwhile, Hector leads the Trojans to almost pushing the Greeks back to the sea (Book XII). Later, Agamemnon contemplates defeat and retreat to Greece (Book XIV). Again, the Wrath of Achilles turns the war's tide in seeking vengeance when Hector kills Patroclus. Aggrieved, Achilles tears his hair and dirties his face. Thetis comforts her mourning son, who tells her:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
So it was here that the lord of men Agamemnon angered me.&lt;br /&gt;
Still, we will let all this be a thing of the past, and for all our&lt;br /&gt;
sorrow beat down by force the anger deeply within us.&lt;br /&gt;
Now I shall go, to overtake that killer of a dear life,&lt;br /&gt;
Hektor; then I will accept my own death, at whatever&lt;br /&gt;
time Zeus wishes to bring it about, and the other immortals.&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad''. Richmond Lattimore, translator. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1951). 18.111‚Äì16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Accepting the prospect of death as fair price for avenging Patroclus, he returns to battle, dooming Hector and Troy, thrice chasing him 'round the Trojan walls, before slaying him, then dragging the corpse behind his chariot, back to camp.

The poem dates to the [[Archaic Greece|archaic]] period of [[Classical Antiquity]]. Scholarly consensus mostly places it in the 8th century BC, although some favour a 7th-century date. [[Herodotus]], having consulted the [[Oracle]] at [[Dodona]], placed Homer and [[Hesiod]] at approximately 400 years before his own time, which would place them at c.850 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus (de S√©lincourt 1954), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical backdrop of the poem is the time of the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]], in the early 12th century BC. Homer is thus separated from his subject matter by about 400 years, the period known as the [[Greek Dark Ages]]. Intense scholarly debate has surrounded the question of which portions of the poem preserve genuine traditions from the [[Mycenaean period]]. The ''[[Catalogue of Ships]]'' in particular has the striking feature that its geography does not portray Greece in the [[Iron Age]], the time of Homer, but as it was before the [[Dorian invasion]].

The title {{lang|grc|·º∏ŒªŒπŒ¨œÇ}} "Ilias" (genitive {{lang|grc|·º∏ŒªŒπŒ¨Œ¥ŒøœÇ}} "Iliados") is elliptic for {{lang|grc|·º° œÄŒøŒØŒ∑œÉŒπœÇ ·º∏ŒªŒπŒ¨œÇ}} "he po√≠esis Ili√°s", meaning "the Trojan poem". {{lang|grc|·º∏ŒªŒπŒ¨œÇ}}, "of Troy", is the specifically feminine adjective form from {{lang|grc|·ººŒªŒπŒøŒΩ}}, "Troy"; the masculine adjective form would be {{lang|grc|·º∏ŒªŒπŒ±Œ∫œåœÇ}} or {{lang|grc|·ººŒªŒπŒøœÇ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|*)ilia/s|·º∏ŒªŒπŒ¨œÇ}}, {{LSJ|*)iliako/s|·º∏ŒªŒπŒ±Œ∫œåœÇ}}, {{LSJ|*)/ilios|·ººŒªŒπŒøœÇ|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by [[Herodotus]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Hist.]]'' 2.116&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Iliad'' as oral tradition===
In antiquity, the Greeks applied the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' as the bases of [[pedagogy]]. Literature was central to the educational-cultural function of the itinerant [[rhapsode]], who composed ''consistent'' epic poems from memory and improvisation, and disseminated them, via song and chant, in his travels and at the [[Panathenaic Festival]] of athletics, music, poetics, and sacrifice, celebrating [[Athena]]'s birthday.&lt;ref&gt;''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Fifth Edition (1994) p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, Classical scholars treated the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' as written poetry, and Homer as a writer. Yet, by the 1920s, [[Milman Parry]] (1902‚Äì1935) had launched a movement claiming otherwise. His investigation of the oral Homeric style‚Äî"stock epithets" and "reiteration" (words, phrases, stanzas)‚Äîestablished that these ''formulae'' were artifacts of [[oral tradition]] easily applied to an [[hexameter|hexametric]] line. A two-word stock epithet (e.g. "resourceful Odysseus") reiteration may complement a character name by filling a half-line, thus, freeing the poet to compose a half-line of "original" formulaic text to complete his meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, John. ''The Iliad as Oral Formulaic Poetry'' (8 May 2006)  University of Saskatchewan. Retrieved 26 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In Yugoslavia, Parry and his assistant, [[Albert Lord]] (1912‚Äì1991), studied the oral-formulaic composition of [[Serbian language|Serbian]] oral poetry, yielding the [[Parry/Lord thesis]] that established [[oral tradition]] studies, later developed by [[Eric Havelock]], [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Walter Ong]], and [[Gregory Nagy]].

In ''[[The Singer of Tales]]'' (1960), Lord presents likenesses between the tragedies of the Greek Patroclus, in the ''Iliad'', and of the [[Sumer]]ian [[Enkidu]], in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', and claims to refute, with "careful analysis of the repetition of thematic patterns", that the Patroclus storyline upsets Homer's established compositional formulae of "wrath, bride-stealing, and rescue"; thus, stock-phrase ''reiteration'' does not restrict his originality in fitting story to rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Albert. ''The Singer of Tales'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press (1960) p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Albert. ''The Singer of Tales'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press (1960) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, in ''The Arming Motif'', Prof. James Armstrong reports that the poem's ''formulae'' yield richer meaning because the "arming motif" ''diction''‚Äîdescribing Achilles, Agamemnon, Paris, and Patroclus‚Äîserves to "heighten the importance of&amp;nbsp;... an impressive moment", thus, "[reiteration] creates an atmosphere of smoothness", wherein, Homer distinguishes Patroclus from Achilles, and foreshadows the former's death with positive and negative turns of phrase.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'', Book XVI, 130‚Äì54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, James I.  ''The Arming Motif in the Iliad''. The American Journal of Philology, Vol. 79, No. 4. (1958), pp. 337‚Äì54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Iliad'', occasional syntactic inconsistency may be an oral tradition effect‚Äîfor example, Aphrodite is "laughter-loving", despite being painfully wounded by Diomedes (Book V, 375); and the divine representations may mix Mycenaean and [[Greek Dark Age]] (c. 1150‚Äì800 BC) mythologies, parallelling the hereditary ''basileis'' nobles (lower social rank rulers) with minor deities, such as [[Scamander]], et al.&lt;ref&gt;Toohey, Peter. ''Reading Epic: An Introduction to the Ancient Narrative''. New Fetter Lane, London: Routledge, (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warfare in the ''Iliad''==
===Depiction of infantry combat===
Despite Mycenae and Troy being maritime powers, the ''Iliad'' features no sea battles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Iliad|en|3|45|shortref}}‚Äì50&lt;/ref&gt; So, the Trojan shipwright (of the ship that transported Helen to Troy), [[Phereclus]], fights afoot, as an infantryman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Iliad|5|59|shortref}}‚Äì65&lt;/ref&gt; The battle dress and armour of hero and soldier are well-described. They enter battle in [[chariot]]s, launching javelins into the enemy formations, then dismount‚Äîfor hand-to-hand combat with yet more javelin throwing, rock throwing, and if necessary hand to hand sword and a shoulder-borne ''hoplon'' (shield) fighting.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Keegan|Keegan, John]]. ''[[A History of Warfare]]'' (1993) p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; Ajax the Greater, son of Telamon, sports a large, rectangular shield ({{lang|grc|œÉŒ¨Œ∫ŒøœÇ}}, ''sakos'') with which he protects himself and Teucer, his brother:

:Ninth came Teucer, stretching his curved bow.
:He stood beneath the shield of Ajax, son of Telamon.
:As Ajax cautiously pulled his shield aside,
:Teucer would peer out quickly, shoot off an arrow,
:hit someone in the crowd, dropping that soldier
:right where he stood, ending his life‚Äîthen he'd duck back,
:crouching down by Ajax, like a child beside its mother.
:Ajax would then conceal him with his shining shield.
: (''Iliad'' 8.267‚Äì72, Ian Johnston, translator)

Ajax's cumbersome shield is more suitable for defence than for offence, while his cousin, Achilles, sports a large, rounded, octagonal shield that he successfully deploys along with his spear against the Trojans:

:Just as a man constructs a wall for some high house,
:using well-fitted stones to keep out forceful winds,
:that's how close their helmets and bossed shields lined up,
:shield pressing against shield, helmet against helmet
:man against man. On the bright ridges of the helmets,
:horsehair plumes touched when warriors moved their heads.
:That's how close they were to one another.
: (''Iliad'' 16.213‚Äì17, Ian Johnston, translator)

In describing infantry combat, Homer names the [[phalanx formation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Iliad|en|6|6|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most scholars do not believe the historical Trojan War was so fought.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, Tomas. ''Sailing the Wine Dark Sea: Why the Greeks Matter'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bronze Age]], the chariot was the main battle transport-weapon (e.g. the [[Battle of Kadesh]]). The available evidence, from the Dendra armour and the Pylos Palace paintings, indicate the Mycenaeans used two-man chariots, with a long-spear-armed principal rider, unlike the three-man Hittite chariots with short-spear-armed riders, and unlike the arrow-armed Egyptian and Assyrian two-man chariots. Nestor spearheads his troops with chariots; he advises them:

:In your eagerness to engage the Trojans,
:don't any of you charge ahead of others,
:trusting in your strength and horsemanship.
:And don't lag behind. That will hurt our charge.
:Any man whose chariot confronts an enemy's
:should thrust with his spear at him from there.
:That's the most effective tactic, the way
:men wiped out city strongholds long ago ‚Äî
:their chests full of that style and spirit.
: (''Iliad'' 4.301‚Äì09, Ian Johnston, translator)

Although Homer's depictions are graphic, it can be seen in the very end that victory in war is a far more somber occasion, where all that is lost becomes apparent. On the other hand, the funeral games are lively, for the dead man's life is celebrated. This overall depiction of war runs contrary to many other{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} ancient Greek depictions, where war is an aspiration for greater glory.

===Influence on classical Greek warfare===
While the Homeric poems (the ''Iliad'' in particular) were not necessarily revered scripture of the ancient Greeks, they were most certainly seen as guides that were important to the intellectual understanding of any educated Greek citizen.  This is evidenced by the fact that in the late fifth century BC, "it was the sign of a man of standing to be able to recite the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' by heart."&lt;ref&gt;Lendon, J.E."Soldiers and Ghosts" (2005) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it can be argued that the warfare shown in the ''Iliad'', and the way in which it was depicted, had a profound and very traceable effect on Greek warfare in general. In particular, the effect of epic literature can be broken down into three categories: [[Military tactics|tactics]], [[ideology]], and the [[mindset]] of commanders.  In order to discern these effects, it is necessary to take a look at a few examples from each of these categories.

Much of the detailed fighting in the ''Iliad'' is done by the heroes in an orderly, one-on-one fashion.  Much like the ''Odyssey'', there is even a set ritual which must be observed in each of these conflicts.  For example, a major hero may encounter a lesser hero from the opposing side, in which case the minor hero is introduced, threats may be exchanged, and then the minor hero is slain.  The victor often strips the body of its armor and military accoutrements.&lt;ref&gt;Lendon, J.E. "Soldiers and Ghosts" (2005) pp.&amp;nbsp;22‚Äì23&lt;/ref&gt; Here is an example of this ritual and this type of one-on-one combat in the ''Iliad'':&lt;blockquote&gt;
There Telamonian Ajax struck down the son of Anthemion,
Simoeisios in his stripling's beauty, whom once his mother
descending from Ida bore beside the banks of Simoeis
when she had followed her father and mother to tend the
sheepflocks.
Therefore they called him Simoeisios; but he could not
render again the care of his dear parents; he was short-lived,
beaten down beneath the spear of high-hearted Ajax,
who struck him as he first came forward beside the nipple
of the right breast, and the bronze spearhead drove clean
through the shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad''. 4.473‚Äì83, Lattimore, translator&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The biggest issue in reconciling the connection between the epic fighting of the ''Iliad'' and later Greek warfare is the phalanx, or hoplite, warfare seen in Greek history well after Homer's ''Iliad''.  While there are discussions of soldiers arrayed in semblances of the phalanx throughout the ''Iliad'', the focus of the poem on the heroic fighting, as mentioned above, would seem to contradict the tactics of the phalanx.  However, the phalanx did have its heroic aspects. The masculine one-on-one fighting of epic is manifested in phalanx fighting on the emphasis of holding one's position in formation.  This replaces the singular heroic competition found in the ''Iliad''.&lt;ref&gt;Lendon, J.E. "Soldiers and Ghosts" (2005) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of this is the Spartan tale of 300 picked men fighting against 300 picked Argives.  In this battle of champions, only two men are left standing for the Argives and one for the Spartans.  Othryades, the remaining Spartan, goes back to stand in his formation with mortal wounds while the remaining two Argives go back to Argos to report their victory.  Thus, the Spartans claimed this as a victory, as their last man displayed the ultimate feat of bravery by maintaining his position in the phalanx.&lt;ref&gt;{{Anabasis|6|5|17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the ideology of commanders in later Greek history, the ''Iliad'' has an interesting effect.  The ''Iliad'' expresses a definite disdain for tactical trickery, when Hector says, before he challenges the great Ajax: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I know how to storm my way into the struggle of flying horses; I know how to tread the measures on the grim floor of the war god. Yet great as you are I would not strike you by stealth, watching for my chance, but openly, so, if perhaps I might hit you.&lt;ref&gt;(''Iliad''. 7.237‚Äì43, Lattimore, translator)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, despite examples of disdain for this tactical trickery, there is reason to believe that the ''Iliad'', as well as later Greek warfare, endorsed tactical genius on the part of their commanders.  For example, there are multiple passages in the ''Iliad'' with commanders such as Agamemnon or Nestor discussing the arraying of troops so as to gain an advantage.  Indeed, the Trojan War is won by a notorious example of Greek guile in the [[Trojan Horse]].  This is even later referred to by Homer in the ''Odyssey''.  The connection, in this case, between guileful tactics of the Greeks in the ''Iliad'' and those of the later Greeks is not a difficult one to find. Spartan commanders, often seen as the pinnacle of Greek military prowess, were known for their tactical trickery, and, for them, this was a feat to be desired in a commander. Indeed, this type of leadership was the standard advice of Greek tactical writers.&lt;ref&gt;Lendon, J.E. "Soldiers and Ghosts" (2005) p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, while Homeric (or epic) fighting is certainly not completely replicated in later Greek warfare, many of its ideals, tactics, and instruction are.&lt;ref&gt;A large amount of the citations and argumentation in this section of the article must be ultimately attributed to:Lendon, J.E. ''Soldiers and Ghosts: A History of Battle in Classical Antiquity''. New Haven, CT: Yale UP, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hans van Wees argues that the period that the descriptions of warfare relate can be pinned down fairly specifically‚Äîto the first half of the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Greek Warfare: Myth and Realities [Paperback]

==Influence on the arts and literature==
{{Main article|Trojan War in popular culture}}
The ''Iliad'' was a standard work of great importance already in [[Classical Greece]] and remained so throughout the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] periods. Subjects from the Trojan War were a favourite among ancient Greek dramatists. [[Aeschylus]]' trilogy, the ''[[Oresteia]]'', comprising ''Agamemnon'', ''The Libation Bearers'' and ''The Eumenides'', follows the story of Agamemnon after his return from the war. Homer also came to be of great influence in European culture with the resurgence of interest in Greek antiquity during the [[Renaissance]], and it remains the first and most influential work of the [[Western canon]]. In its full form the text made its return to Italy and Western Europe beginning in the 15th century, primarily through translations into Latin and the vernacular languages. 

Prior to this reintroduction, however, a shortened Latin version of the poem, known as the ''[[Ilias Latina]]'', was very widely studied and read as a basic school text. The West tended to view Homer as unreliable as they believed they possessed much more down to earth and realistic eyewitness accounts of the Trojan War written by [[Dares]] and [[Dictys Cretensis]], who were supposedly present at the events. These [[late antique]] forged accounts formed the basis of several eminently popular [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[chivalric romance]]s, most notably those of [[Beno√Æt de Sainte-Maure]] and [[Guido delle Colonne]]. These in turn spawned many others in various European languages, such as the first printed English book, the 1473 ''[[Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye]]''. Other accounts read in the Middle Ages were antique Latin retellings such as the ''[[Excidium Troiae]]'' and works in the vernaculars such as the [[Tr√≥jumanna saga|Icelandic Troy Saga]]. Even without Homer, the Trojan War story had remained central to Western European [[medieval literature|medieval literary]] culture and its sense of identity. Most nations and several royal houses traced their origins to heroes at the [[Trojan War]]. Britain was supposedly settled by the Trojan [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]], for instance.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

[[William Shakespeare]] used the plot of the ''Iliad'' as source material for his play ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', but focused on a medieval legend, the love story of [[Troilus]], son of King Priam of Troy, and [[Cressida]], daughter of the Trojan soothsayer Calchas. The play, often considered to be a comedy, reverses traditional views on events of the Trojan War and depicts Achilles as a coward, Ajax as a dull, unthinking mercenary, etc.

[[William Theed the elder]] made an impressive bronze statue of Thetis as she brought Achilles his new armor forged by Hephaesthus. It has been on display in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City since 2013.

[[Robert Browning]]'s poem ''Development'' discusses his childhood introduction to the matter of the ''Iliad'' and his delight in the epic, as well as contemporary debates about its authorship.

===20th century===
* [[Simone Weil]] wrote the essay "[[The Iliad or the Poem of Force]]" in 1939, shortly after the commencement of [[World War II]]. The essay describes how the ''Iliad'' demonstrates the way force, exercised to the extreme in war, reduces both victim and aggressor to the level of the slave and the unthinking automaton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bruce B.

* The 1954 [[Broadway musical]] ''[[The Golden Apple (musical)|The Golden Apple]]'', by librettist [[John Treville Latouche]] and composer [[Jerome Moross]], was freely adapted from the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'', re-setting the action to [[United States|America]]'s [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state in the years after the [[Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War]], with events inspired by the ''Iliad'' in Act One and events inspired by the ''Odyssey'' in Act Two.
*[[Christopher Logue]]'s poem ''[[War Music (poem)|War Music]]'', an "account", not a translation, of the ''Iliad'', was begun in 1959 as a commission for radio. He continued working on it until his death in 2011. Described by [[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]] as "one of the most remarkable works of post-war literature", it has been an influence on [[Kate Tempest]] and [[Alice Oswald]], who says that it "unleashes a forgotten kind of theatrical energy into the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=War Music, an account of Homer's Iliad|last=Logue|first=Christopher|publisher=Faber and Faber|year=2015|isbn=978-0-571-31449-2|location=|pages=Introduction by Christopher Reid}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Christa Wolf]]'s novel ''[[Cassandra (novel)|Cassandra]]'' (1983) is a critical engagement with the ''Iliad''. Wolf's narrator is Cassandra, whose thoughts we hear at the moment just before her murder by Clytemnestra in Sparta. Wolf's narrator presents a feminist's view of the war, and of war in general. Cassandra's story is accompanied by four essays which Wolf delivered as&lt;!--at?--&gt; the Frankfurter Poetik-Vorlesungen. The essays present Wolf's concerns as a writer and rewriter of this canonical story and show the genesis of the novel through Wolf's own readings and in a trip she took to Greece.
* [[David Melnick]]'s ''[[Men in Aida]]'' (''cf.'' Œº·øÜŒΩŒπŒΩ ·ºÑŒµŒπŒ¥Œµ) (1983) is a [[Postmodern literature|postmodern]] [[homophonic translation]] of Book One into a farcical bathhouse scenario, preserving the sounds but not the meaning of the original.
* [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s 1987 novel ''[[The Firebrand]]'' retells the story from the point of view of [[Cassandra|Kassandra]], a princess of Troy and a prophetess who is cursed by [[Apollo]].

==English translations==
[[File:Iliad1660Frontis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Wenceslas Hollar]]'s engraved title page of a 1660 edition of the ''Iliad'', translated by [[John Ogilby]].]]
{{further information|English translations of Homer}}
[[File:Iliad editions.jpg|thumb|Sampling of translations and editions of ''Iliad'' in English]]
[[George Chapman]] published his translation of the ''Iliad'', in installments, beginning in 1598, published in "fourteeners", a long-line ballad metre that "has room for all of Homer's figures of speech and plenty of new ones, as well as explanations in parentheses. At its best, as in Achilles' rejection of the embassy in ''Iliad'' Nine; it has great rhetorical power".&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Guide to English Literature in Translation, p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; It quickly established itself as a classic in English poetry. In the preface to his own translation, Pope praises "the daring fiery spirit" of Chapman's rendering, which is "something like what one might imagine Homer, himself, would have writ before he arrived at years of discretion".

[[John Keats]] praised Chapman in the sonnet ''[[On First Looking into Chapman's Homer]]'' (1816). [[John Ogilby]]'s mid-seventeenth-century translation is among the early [[annotated]] editions; [[Alexander Pope]]'s 1715 translation, in heroic couplet, is "The classic translation that was built on all the preceding versions",&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Guide to English Literature in Translation, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; and, like Chapman's, it is a major poetic work in its own right. [[William Cowper]]'s [[Miltonic]], blank verse 1791 edition is highly regarded for its greater fidelity to the Greek than either the Chapman or the Pope versions: "I have omitted nothing; I have invented nothing", Cowper says in prefacing his translation.

In the lectures ''[[On Translating Homer]]'' (1861), [[Matthew Arnold]] addresses the matters of translation and interpretation in rendering the ''Iliad'' to English; commenting upon the versions contemporarily available in 1861, he identifies the four ''essential'' poetic qualities of Homer to which the translator must do justice:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[i] that he is eminently rapid; [ii] that he is eminently plain and direct, both in the evolution of his thought and in the expression of it, that is, both in his syntax and in his words; [iii] that he is eminently plain and direct in the substance of his thought, that is, in his matter and ideas; and, finally, [iv] that he is eminently noble.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After a discussion of the metres employed by previous translators, Arnold argues for a poetical dialect hexameter translation of the ''Iliad'', like the original. "Laborious as this meter was, there were at least half a dozen attempts to translate the entire ''Iliad'' or ''Odyssey'' in hexameters; the last in 1945. Perhaps the most fluent of them was by [[J. Henry Dart]] [1862] in response to Arnold".&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Guide to English Literature in Translation, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, the American poet [[William Cullen Bryant]] published a blank verse version, that [[Van Wyck Brooks]] describes as "simple, faithful".

An 1898 translation by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] was published by Longmans. Butler had read [[Classics]] at Cambridge University, graduating during 1859.&lt;ref&gt;[[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] ‚Äì [http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/iliad-1898 The Iliad (1898)] [[Cambridge University]] [Retrieved 2016-06-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1950, there have been several English translations. [[Richmond Lattimore]]'s version (1951) is "a free six-beat" line-for-line rendering that explicitly eschews "poetical dialect" for "the plain English of today". It is literal, unlike older verse renderings. [[Robert Fitzgerald]]'s version ([[Oxford World's Classics]], 1974) strives to situate the ''Iliad'' in the musical forms of English poetry. His forceful version is freer, with shorter lines that increase the sense of swiftness and energy. [[Robert Fagles]] ([[Penguin Classics]], 1990) and [[Stanley Lombardo]] (1997) are bolder than Lattimore in adding dramatic significance to Homer's conventional and formulaic language. [[Rodney Merrill]]'s translation ([[University of Michigan Press]], 2007) not only renders the work in English verse like the [[dactylic hexameter]] of the original, but also conveys the oral-formulaic nature of the epic song, to which that musical meter gives full value. [[Barry B. Powell]]'s translation ([[Oxford University Press]], 2014) renders the Homeric Greek with a simplicity and dignity reminiscent of the original. Caroline Alexander published the first full-length English translation by a woman in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;

The Immortality Drive contains fully digitized [[DNA]] sequences of a select group of [[humans]], such as physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], comedian and talk show host [[Stephen Colbert]], ''[[Playboy]]'' [[Model (person)|model]] [[Jo Garcia]], game designer [[Richard Garriott]], fantasy authors [[Tracy Hickman]] and [[Laura Hickman]], [[professional wrestling|pro wrestler]] [[Matt Morgan (wrestler)|Matt Morgan]], and athlete [[Lance Armstrong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gandt.blogs.brynmawr.edu/2009/04/19/immortality-drive/ Immortality Drive] from Gender and Technology 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/english-news/article2411553/Stephen-Colbert-to-have-his-DNA-sent-to-space.html Immortality Drive: Stephen Colbert to have his DNA sent to space] from ''Welt Online''&lt;/ref&gt; The microchip also contains a copy of ''[[George's Secret Key to the Universe]]'', a children's book authored by Stephen Hawking and his daughter, [[Lucy Hawking|Lucy]].

The intent of the Immortality Drive is to preserve human DNA in a [[time capsule]], in case some global cataclysm should occur on Earth.

The Immortality Drive was featured in [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]'s ''[[Life After People]]'', first-season episode "The Bodies Left Behind".

==Early life and education==

John B. Stephenson was born in [[Staunton, Virginia]], on September 26, 1937.

He earned a B.A. degree in sociology from the [[College of William and Mary]] in Virginia in 1959, and M.A. (1961) and Ph.D. (1966) degrees in sociology from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].  His dissertation, a community study of Celo, North Carolina, became his first book, ''Shiloh: A Mountain Community'' (1968).

==Teaching career==

He began his teaching career at [[Lees-McRae College]] in [[Banner Elk, North Carolina]], from 1961 to 1964, where he met and married a colleague, Jane Ellen Baucom, in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Ford and Osborne, ''John B. Stephenson'', pp. 20-22.&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to Chapel Hill to complete his doctoral studies, he joined department of sociology at the [[University of Kentucky]] in Lexington in the fall of 1966.  Connecting with the emerging field of [[Appalachian studies]], he co-edited ''Appalachia in the Sixties'' (1972) with sociology graduate student [[David Walls (academic)|David Walls]].  He served as dean of undergraduate studies from 1978 to 1981, as special assistant to the chancellor in 1983-84, and was the first director of the Appalachian Center, which he was instrumental in helping organize, from 1979 to 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Williams, "An Idealistic Boss at Berea," ''The Courier-Journal Magazine'', December 1, 1985, pp. 14-19.&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time he became an incorporator and first chair of the Appalachian Studies Conference (now known as the [[Appalachian Studies Association]]).

==President of Berea College==

In 1984 he was appointed the seventh president of [[Berea College]] in [[Berea, Kentucky]], the first president of the liberal arts college to come from a public university.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wilson, "Berea names UK official as president of college," ''The Courier-Journal'', January 29, 1984, p. B4.&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure as president, Berea College reemphasized its historic commitment to African American and Appalachian students.  The college also took initiatives to support women, including Jane Stephenson's New Opportunity School for Women.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Saylor Farr, "New Opportunities for Appalachian Women," ''Appalachian Journal'', Summer 2003, pp. 350-354.&lt;/ref&gt;  Faculty and staff salaries were increased significantly.

John Stephenson established ties with a diverse group of notable people whom he brought to speak at Berea College, from ''Roots'' author [[Alex Haley]], and Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] of South Africa, to the [[Dalai Lama]].  Stephenson established the Tibetan scholarship program, which supports students at Berea College from the Tibetan exile community in India.  He was also a successful fundraiser; during his tenure as president, the Berea College endowment increased from $120 to $360 million.  Stephenson retired in July 1994, several years after he was diagnosed with leukemia.  He died suddenly after a viral infection in December 1994.

He was selected as an [[American Council on Education]] Fellow in 1973-74, and as a [[Fulbright program|Fulbright]] Senior Research Scholar in 1981, which he used for research in Scotland which was presented in his book, ''Ford: A Village in the West Highlands of Scotland'' (1984).  He served on boards of the Kentucky Literacy Foundation, the national [[Elderhostel]] program, the [[Frontier Nursing Service]], and the Appalachian Regional Hospitals.  &lt;ref&gt;Larry D.

The '''Jones-Liddell feud''' (1847-1870) also known as the '''Liddell-Jones feud''' or the '''Black River War''' was an ongoing warring dispute between two prominent families from [[Catahoula Parish, Louisiana]]. It resulted in the death of at least six people with other estimates suggesting as many as fourteen.

== Background ==
Personal allegiances to one faction or another, as well as sensationalized press accounts during and after the series of events provide for a variance of details concerning the Jones-Liddell feud. It was born however from disagreements between two individuals; Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell]] and Lt. Col. Charles Jones. Each of these men were members of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] in the 1850s, and held significant wealth leading up to the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ROBERTSON|first=HENRY O|date=2012|title=Who Were the Whigs of Catahoula Parish, 1840?|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23266744|journal=Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association|volume=53| issue =  3|pages=292‚Äì317|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liddell was the second largest slave owner in Catahoula parish, with 115 slaves, while Jones owned 101 slaves. Each served as the patriarch of his respective family, with children who also would become participants in the feud. Both of these rivaling plantation owners arrived in Catahoula Parish at approximately the same time (1837-1840), and each would later serve in the Confederate Army. Following the war however, Liddell remained a loyal Democrat and defender of the southern cause. Jones however, became a Republican convert, at a time when the federal government installed Republican loyalists in government across the state.{{sfnp|Liddell's Record|1997|p=203}}
[[File:Riverside Park in Jonesville, LA IMG 1181.JPG|thumb|180x180px|"Jonesville" is found at the place where the Ouachita, Tensas, and Little Rivers intersect. These three rivers become the Black River.]]
General Liddell was the son of a wealthy plantation owner from [[Wilkinson County, Mississippi]]. After reaching the age of adulthood, he moved to Catahoula Parish on the [[Ouachita River#Black River|Black River]], and constructed a plantation which he named "Llanada" near [[Harrisonburg, Louisiana]]. Liddell had attended [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], and was a personal friend of future Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]].

Col. Jones was born in Kentucky, married in Ohio, and eventually settled in Catahoula Parish and established a plantation named "Troy," also on the Black River, approximately five miles south of Liddell's plantation. Jones was second in command of the 17th Volunteer Louisiana Infantry, but was injured early in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33SQ-GBSD-BK8?cc=1473181&amp;wc=7QGH-YN6%3A1589427264%2C1589427843%2C1589428038|title=United States Census, 1860|last=|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch.com|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.|page=Louisiana &gt; Catahoula &gt; Harrisonburg &gt; image 2 of 2|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Feud Begins ==
[[File:St. John Richardson Liddle.jpg|thumb|245x245px|[[St. John Richardson Liddell|General St. John Richardson Liddell]]]]
The most widely accepted account of how the feud began involves a neighboring family to both Liddell and Jones. Phillip and Eliza Nichols, who were personal friends of the Liddell family, owned a prominent piece of land that Col. Jones greatly coveted. Most accounts suggest that Jones had publicly maligned the character and virtue of Mrs. Nichols. Mrs. Eliza Nichols made a personal request for General Liddell to accompany her in confronting Col. Jones about his efforts to disparage her character. Gen. Liddell agreed and together they confronted Col. Jones at his home. As Mrs. Nichols approached Col. Jones however, she pulled out a pistol and shot him in the face; an action that General Liddell claimed he did not expect from her, nor have prior knowledge of.{{sfnp|Liddell's Record|1997|p=23}}

Col. Jones was injured, but the gunshot did not kill him. Rather than holding Mrs. Nichols as the responsible party for his injury, he solely placed the blame on General Liddell. As Col. Jones rested at home in recovery, rumors began to escalate that Jones was plotting a revenge attack on Liddell and his family. The tensions would continue to escalate, and each family found themselves consumed with fortifying their respective plantations, and stocking up on guns and ammunition. Residents in the community feverishly fueled these tensions, and unofficial factions began to form throughout the area.{{sfnp|Liddell's Record|1997|p=24}}

== Col. Jones' Temporary Absence ==
Tensions between the two feuding families found a temporary reprieve, when Col. Jones and his wife left for Ohio for a period of four years. Many accounts suggest that Col. Jones continued to send threats to Liddell during this time, stating his intention to return and kill him. In 1852, Jones made his return to his plantation on the Black River, accompanied by hired assassins, including one notoriously known as such by the name of Richard Pryor.{{sfnp|Liddell's Record|1997|p=24}}

== The Feud Reignites ==
With Jones' return to Catahoula Parish, aided by what appeared to be hired guns, and encouraged by friends who sided with the Jones family, the feud once again stoked tensions in the region.

A nephew of Col. Jones by the name of Sam Smith added his name to the list of those publicly professing he would kill General Liddell.{{sfnp|Liddell's Record|1997|p=24}}

One account suggests that on Election Day, Pryor and Smith waited for Liddell behind trees on what they believed was a path Liddell would be traveling en route to cast his vote. Another friend of Col. Jones by the name of Henry Huntington went to Liddell's "Llanada" and discharged his pistol. He then publicly called General Liddell a coward, and challenged him to a duel to be held on the Texas state line. Liddell however believed the challenge was merely another attempt towards assassination, should Liddell travel to the Texas line, and therefore declined.

Yet another Jones sympathizer by the name of Samuel Glenn made public threats against Liddell and his family. Liddell was tipped off that Glenn and Pryor were in town, and had plans at yet another attempt on his life. On June 26, 1852, Samuel Glen and a neighbor of Liddell's by the name of Moses Wiggins were ambushed by the road near "Trinity." Liddell professes to having killed them both, but admitted he mistook Moses Wiggins for Pryor. Though Wiggins too had been a Jones sympathizer, Liddell actually killed him by mistake. Liddell was arrested for murder.{{sfnp|Liddell's Record|1997|p=25}}

== Liddell's Arrest for Murder ==
Liddell's friends and allies defended his actions due to the well established public threats that had been levied toward his life. Liddell hired well established attorneys from both Natchez, as well as Louisiana. Despite two grand juries, Liddell was finally acquitted in 1854.{{sfnp|Liddell's Record|1997|p=25}}

== Civil War ==
The feud quieted down as a result of the [[American Civil War]]. Both Liddell and Jones each enlisted in support of the Confederate cause. 
[[File:Murder of Louisiana sacrificed on the altar of radicalism LCCN2008661710.tif|thumb|19th Century cartoon illustrating southern sentiments concerning Grant's reconstruction. ''"Murder of Louisiana sacrificed on the altar of radicalism." [https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2008661710/]'']]

== After the War ==
[[File:William Pitt Kellogg 001.jpg|thumb|291x291px|[[William Pitt Kellogg]] (December 8, 1830 ‚Äì August 10, 1918) was an American lawyer and Republican Party politician who served as a United States Senator from 1868 to 1872 and from 1877 to 1883 and as the Governor of Louisiana from 1873 to 1877 during the Reconstruction Era.]]
Following the crippling defeat of the Confederate States, both Liddell and Jones each returned home to try and salvage the once prosperous plantations. The economic fate of each man would be determined over the next five years largely by the political choices each made.{{sfnp|Liddell's Record|1997|p=203}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;During these early years of reconstruction, a political divide was created that ultimately resulted in terror and lawlessness throughout the south. With post-war government being installed by federal forces, southern sympathizers and loyal Democrats found themselves on the outside looking in. Only days before President Lincoln's assassination, he installed [[William Pitt Kellogg]] as the federal collector of customs in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. This began a twenty-year reign by the northerner in what became known as the Kellogg Government. Natives of the state resisted violently and violence occurred throughout the state.{{sfnp|Liddell's Record|1997|p=202}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

General Liddell was a staunch and loyal Democrat, who remained opposed to the Kellogg government. Col. Jones on the other hand, sensing a need to protect his estate and future fortunes, became a new convert for the Republicans. The reach of the Kellogg government reached all the way down to the local level, where in Catahoula Parish, the Sheriff and the Judge were placed in their positions of power as known Kellogg loyalists.

As a result, many local citizens expressed their opposition to Republican rule by siding with General Liddell. Col. Jones on the other hand, found certain advantages of his own by being politically connected to those in power with the Kellogg government.

== Economic Ruin for Liddell ==
When Liddell returned to "Llanada" after the war, it was on the verge of financial ruins. No longer able to utilize slave labor, and with banks setup by northerners lending money at high interest rates, Liddell faced complete ruin, and would ultimately see his beloved Llanada forced into a sale at public auction, in order to cover Liddell's debts.

Col. Jones on the other hand did not face the same economic fate. When Liddell's Llanada was placed up for auction, Jones began to negotiate with a third party to purchase the place. Upon discovering Jones' interest in acquiring his property, Liddell sent a warning to Jones, intimating bluntly that he could not stand for Jones to seize the property which held the graves of his dead family. Once again, tensions became heated between the two factions.

== Assassination of General Liddell ==
[[File:Unidentified Steamer Boats.jpg|thumb|180x180px|A Steamer used for transport, such as those seen here, was the scene of General Liddell's murder.]]
Both Liddell and Jones were frequent visitors to New Orleans, which could be reached by riverboat with moderate ease. In 1870, Liddell had boarded the steamer on the Black River heading to New Orleans. The captain knew that Col. Jones had coincidentally also planned a trip to New Orleans and would be boarding the steamer. Sensing potential trouble ahead, he alerted General Liddell of this news. Liddell at once had him send word to Jones that he should not board the steamer. Upon receiving this news, Jones at once gathered his sons and took off by horseback to a loading dock south of his own landing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=13327677|title=19 Feb 1870, Page 2 - The Ouachita Telegraph at Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the steamer pulled in at that place, Gen. Liddell was seated having lunch, unaware of the pending danger. Jones and his sons boarded the steamer and drew their weapons on Liddell. Upon seeing their entry, the captain alerted Liddell at once that the men were coming to murder him. Liddell rose to draw his weapon in defense, but Jones and his sons fired away, killing General Liddell instantly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{sfnp|Liddell's Record|1997|p=205}}

== Jones' Arrest and Liddell's Allies Seek Revenge ==
Upon hearing the news of General Liddell's death, shock and horror enveloped the entire region. Col. Jones and his sons were placed under arrest, but Sheriff Oliver Ballard, a Republican ally of Jones, allowed them to remain in custody at his personal home.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=23054145|title=12 Jul 1885, 1 - The San Francisco Examiner at Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Days after the murder of General Liddell, his son [[Moses J. Liddell|Moses "Judge" Liddell]] was traveling on a steamer near the Sheriff's home where Jones and his sons had been placed under house arrest. While passing this place, Moses Liddell saw Col. Jones walking down near the river, and at once raised his gun and took aim. He fired upon Jones, making no excuse for himself other than retribution for the murder of his father. Moses Liddell's shot however did not kill Col. Jones.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Ultimately, the residents of the area by this point demanded retribution, but sensed none was in order due to Jones' Republican political ties. A mob soon formed, and they stormed the place where Jones and his sons were being held. The mob ultimately killed Col. Jones, as well as his son William. Others found at the place were spared. One son of Jones, Cuthbert Bullitt, slipped out of a second story window, and held on to the ledge, so as not to be found. His life was spared as a result.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== The Feud Ends ==
[[File:Hon. Moses J. Liddell.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Judge Moses J. Liddell - Appointed Judge of the Supreme Court of the Montana Territory]]
The deaths from the feud came to an end as a result of the mob's actions. General Liddell was buried at Llanada plantation. Col. Jones and his son were both interred on the family cemetery at his Everly Plantation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=23063656|title=25 Feb 1973, Page 43 - The Town Talk at Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The community of [[Jonesville, Louisiana]] was established near Everly plantation, after Jones' widow helped establish it. The area had been known as Trinity, but Jonesville became her name of choice for the new town.{{sfnp|Liddell's Record|1997|p=21}}

Moses "Judge" Liddell moved his family from the area, taking residence in [[Richland Parish, Louisiana|Richland Parish]] on the banks of [[Boeuf River]]. There he was elected to the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]]. He later moved to [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], and was appointed by Democratic President [[Grover Cleveland]] as a justice on the Supreme Court of territorial Montana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=13261388|title=24 Dec 1887, Page 3 - The Ouachita Telegraph at Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuthburt Jones, having narrowly survived the lynch mob, made a trip to Washington, where he met with [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Grant]] and relayed the tragic events of the feud. Being loyal and sympathetic to Jones as a fellow Republican, Grant appointed him as a consul to Tripoli in 1876. Louisiana Democrats later called upon President Cleveland to rescind Cuthbert's consul appointment in 1885, alleging he was a "known murderer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=23063132|title=1 Jun 1885, Page 1 - The New York Times at Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He would go on however to have a distinguished career as a foreign diplomat, including time as the consul to Peru. Cuthbert Bullit Jones died in South America in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=23056543|title=15 Aug 1876, 1 - New Orleans Republican at Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=23054979|title=Cuthbert Jones Dies in Peru|last=|first=|date=September 10, 1905|work=The Washington Times|access-date=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francois Jones, the youngest son of Col. Jones, also left Louisiana as a result of the feud. He became a prominent citizen in Washington, D.C, but was drowned while attempting to cross a turbulent river near there in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=23055525|title=1 Mar 1910, Page 6 - The Washington Post at Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, descendants of the family and residents of the surrounding areas gathered for a re-enactment of the events that took place in the Jones-Liddell feud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.natchezdemocrat.com/2009/10/31/longtime-catahoula-parish-feud-to-reignite-next-weekend/|title=Longtime Catahoula parish feud to reignite next weekend|last=Hogan|first=`Vershal|date=October 31, 2009|work=The Natchez Democrat|access-date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the art of [[conjuring]], '''lapping''' refers to a set of techniques whereby a performer seated at a table can secretly dispose of an item into their lap.  A common lapping technique is to sweep an item into the lap while pretending to pick it off the tabletop.&lt;ref name=MagicTricksInc&gt;{{cite web|title=Sleeving Secrets Revealed|url=http://www.magictricks.com/dvd-sleeving-and-lapping.html|publisher=Magic Tricks Incorporated|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflicts==
There are two issues with lapping: one must prepare the lap beforehand so that objects do not slip between the legs and retrieval of the lapped object(s).

==Features==
Subtle uses of lapping, such as secret switches or disposing of secret devices, enable effects that would not otherwise be possible.  Stand-up magicians, such as "table-hoppers" at restaurants, may need to use a [[Topit]] or other device to obtain a similar effect, due to their inability to lap. The magicians who utilize the trick of lapping are able to manipulate items on a surface to the edge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7605">'''Lasswell's model of communication''' (also known as '''Lasswell's communication model''') describes an act of communication by defining who said it, what was said, in what channel it was said, to whom it was said, and with what effect it was said. It  is regarded by many [[Communication studies|communication]] and [[public relations]] scholars as "one of the earliest and most influential [[communication model]]s."&lt;ref name="shoemaker2"/&gt;{{rp|109}} The model was developed by American [[Political science|political scientist]] and communication theorist [[Harold Lasswell]] in 1948 while he was a [[professor]] at [[Yale Law School]].&lt;ref name="muth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Muth, R.|title=Harold D. Lasswell: An Annotated Bibliography.|year=1990|publisher=New Haven Press|location=New Haven|author2=Finley, M. |author3=Muth, M. |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1948 article "The Structure and Function of Communication in Society", Lasswell wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[A] convenient way to describe an act of communication is to answer the following questions:
*Who
*Says What
*In Which Channel
*To Whom
*With What Effect?&lt;ref name="lasswell"/&gt;{{rp|37}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Concept and usage==

This verbal communication model has been referred to as "a linear and Uni-directional process",&lt;ref name="shoemaker2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shoemaker|first=Pamela|title=How to Build Social Science Theories|year=2004|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks|author2=Tankard Jr., J. |author3=Lasorsa, D.|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; "a one-way process",&lt;ref name="shoemaker2"/&gt; an "action model",&lt;ref name="shoemaker2"/&gt;{{rp|134}} a media theory "classic",&lt;ref name="real"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Real|first=Michael R.|title=Media Theory: Contributions to an Understanding of American Mass Communications|journal=American Quarterly|year=1980|volume=32|issue=3|page=240|doi=10.2307/2712449}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lubkin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lubkin|first=D.|title=Remembering the Straw Man: the Travels and Adventures of Hypodermic. The History of Media and Communication Research: Contested Memories|year=2008|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|location=New York|editor=Park, D. |editor2=Pooley, J.|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; "widely used segmentation of the communication process",&lt;ref name="real"/&gt; and "a simple, linear, and potentially hypodermic [[conceptualization]] of communication."&lt;ref name="lubkin" /&gt;

The model organizes the "scientific study of the process of communication".&lt;ref name="lasswell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lasswell|first=Harold|title=The Structure and Function of Communication in Society. The Communication of Ideas|year=1948|publisher=Institute for Religious and Social Studies|location=New York|editor=Bryson, L.|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus of the model is broken down by each element of communication: {{"'}}who' refers to the communicator who formulates the [[message]]; 'what' is the content of message; 'channel' indicates the medium of transmission; 'whom' describes either an individual recipient or the [[audience]] of [[mass communication]]; 'effect' is the outcome of the message..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinburg|first=Sheila|title=An Introduction to Communication Studies|year=2007|publisher=Juta &amp; Co|location=Cape Town|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of the message travels from the communicator to the audience. Although this model represents a one-way flow of communication, the "effect" also refers to feedback in public relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reddi|first=C.|title=Effective Public Relations and Media Strategy|year=2009|publisher=PHI Learning Private Limited|location=New Delhi|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model can be used in pedagogical settings to teach students major elements of a communication process and as a starting point for developing hypotheses.

Lasswell stated that the "Who" referred to "control analysis", the "Says What" referred to "[[content analysis]]", the "In Which Channel" referred to "media analysis", the "To Whom" referred to "[[audience analysis]]", and the "With What Effect" referred to "effect analysis".&lt;ref name="lasswell" /&gt;

==Developments and criticisms==

"The Structure and Function of Communication in Society" was reprinted in 1949, 1960, 1966, and 1971.&lt;ref name="muth"/&gt; However, the questions and the model did not change.

[[George Gerbner]], the founder of the [[cultivation theory]], expanded Lasswell's model in 1956 to focus "attention on perception and reaction by the perceiver and the consequences of the communication".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=A.|title=Essentials of Mass Communication Theory|year=1995|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, Richard Braddock suggested that the model be expanded to consider two additional elements that Braddock argued it ignored: "for what purpose" and "under what circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Braddock|first=Richard|title=An Extension of the "Lasswell Formula"|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1958|volume=8|pages=88‚Äì93|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1958.tb01138.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Braddock's model is more applicable to cultivation theory.&lt;ref name="shoemaker2"/&gt;{{rp|137}} According to media scholar Michael Real: "subsequent attempts to add an 'entertainment' function and an 'advertising' function fail to capture Lasswell's intent but provide the largest 'use and gratification' cited by, for example, television viewers."&lt;ref name="real"/&gt;{{rp|244,5}}

In 1993, communication scholars [[Denis McQuail]] and [[Sven Windahl]] referred to Lasswell's model as "perhaps the most famous single phrase in communication research."&lt;ref name=McQ&gt;{{cite book|last=McQuail|first=Denis|title=Communication models for the study of mass communications|year=1993|publisher=Longman|location=New York|edition=2nd|author2=Windahl, Sven |pages=13‚Äì15}}&lt;/ref&gt; McQuail and Windahl also considered the model as a formula that would be transformed into a model once boxes were drawn around each element and arrows connected the elements.&lt;ref name=McQ/&gt; In 1995, Stanley Baran and Dennis Davis recognized it a verbal model of the communication process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baran|first=S.|title=Mass Communication Theory: Foundations, Ferment, and Future|year=1995|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Belmont|author2=Davis, D. |pages=251‚Äì253}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, Greenberg and Salwen acknowledged that Lasswell's model of communication has been widely adopted, but expressed: "Although Lasswell's model draws attention to several key elements in the mass communication process, it does no more than describe general areas of study. It does not link elements together with any specificity, and there is no notion of an active process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenberg|first=B. S.|title=Mass communication theory and research: Concepts and models. In An integrated approach to communication theory and research|year=2008|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Mahwah|pages=61‚Äì74 [69]|author2=Salwen, M. B. |editor=Salwen, M. B. |editor2=Stacks, D.

== ''Horrible Histories Gruesome Guides'' ==

Previously ''Horrible Histories Cities''
Some ''Horrible Histories'' have been based around a particular city, rather than a nation or a specific time period. They also have a map when the front cover is folded out, and explain some structures in the city when the back cover is folded out. Therefore, many people consider them to be a sub-series as well. (Even though Loathsome London doesn't have these qualities, it was included into this sub-series during the republishing of the series from 2008 to 2011.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1407104233 Amazon.com: London (Horrible Histories Gruesome Gd) (9781407104232): Terry Deary: Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BO34LAAACAAJ&amp;dq=horrible+histories&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lPerTffbLo-2vQO-oomWCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwADgK ''Gruesome Guides'']&lt;/ref&gt;

{{American and British English differences}}

This page lists '''works with different titles in the United Kingdom and United States'''. Categories of such works include [[edition (book)#Co-edition|co-editions of books]] and foreign releases of films. Unless otherwise noted, [[United Kingdom|UK]] titles are also used in most other countries, with the exception that [[Canada]] generally uses [[United States|US]] titles. [[Australia]] will sometimes utilize a third alternative title, but more often follows UK or US usage, these differences are included where known. Not listed are minor changes due to [[American and British English spelling differences]]; for example, the American film ''[[Rumor Has It...]]'' is titled ''Rumour Has It...'' in the UK, and, atypically, in Canada as well.

Legend:
*An [[asterisk]] (*) indicates which of the two countries the work originated in. If a work originated in a third country, this is covered in the Notes column. 
*[c] indicates cases where Canada follows UK usage.

| ''Anne of Windy Willows''

| Canadian author [[Lucy Maud Montgomery]]
| The UK title is also used in Australia and Japan. The two editions are not exactly the same, as when the book was first published, the working title was ''Anne of Windy Willows'', but Montgomery's publisher wanted to change it because of its purported similarity to [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s novel ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]''. The same publisher also requested some scenes to be cut out for perceived gory or terrifying content, to which Montgomery complied. Montgomery's UK publisher, however, did not see the need for any of these changes, and published the unedited book under the title ''Anne of Windy Willows''.

'''Los Kat√≠os National Natural Park''' ({{lang-es|Parque Nacional Natural (PNN) Los Kat√≠os}}) is a protected area located in northwest [[Colombia]] which covers about {{convert|720|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The elevation ranges between {{convert|50|and|600|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It is a part of the [[Dari√©n Gap]], a densely forested area shared by [[Panama]] and Colombia, and is contiguous with the [[Dari√©n National Park]] in Panama. The [[Pan-American Highway]], when completed as proposed, would pass near or through Los Kat√≠os. The park was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1994 due to the extraordinary diversity of plant and animal species represented. The park contains over 25% of the bird species reported for Colombia in an area less than 1% of the total Colombian territory.

The topography of the Los Katios National Park is diverse, with low hills, forests and wet plains comprising its total area.&lt;ref name="Los Kat√≠os National Park"&gt;{{cite web|title=Los Kat√≠os National Park|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/711|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two largest parts of the park are the [[Serran√≠a del Dari√©n]] mountains, which lie to the west, and the [[Atrato River]] floodplains in the east.  The floodplains hold exceptionally fertile soil and consist of alluvial plains of two types. One consists of low-lying terraces that flood often and the other has high terraces that seldom flood. There are also low hills of up to {{convert|250|m|ft}} in elevation and others that are {{convert|600|m|ft}} high. Swampy marshes spread for nearly half of the park's total area. The wetlands of the Atrato floodplain are unique. Cativo, one of the indigenous species, can grow to a height of {{convert|50|m|ft}}. It lends its name to a formation called 'catival', something that is found nowhere in the world except Colombia, south Central America and [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref name="Los Kat√≠os National Park"/&gt;

'''Mayapan''' ('''M√†ayap√°an''' in [[Yucatec Maya language|Modern Maya]]), (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''' Mayap√°n'''), (pronounced mƒ´-√§-Ààp√§n) is a [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site a couple of kilometers south of the town of [[Telchaquillo]] in [[Municipality of Tecoh]], approximately 40&amp;nbsp;km south-east of [[M√©rida, Yucat√°n|M√©rida]] and 100&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Chichen Itza]]; in the state of [[Yucat√°n (state)|Yucat√°n]], [[Mexico]]. Mayapan was the political and cultural capital of the Maya in the Yucat√°n Peninsula during the Late Post-Classic period from the 1220s until the 1440s. Estimates of the total city population are 15,000‚Äì17,000 persons, and the site has more than 4,000 structures within the city walls, and additional dwellings outside.

The site has been professionally surveyed and excavated by archeological teams, beginning in 1939; five years of work was done by a team in the 1950s, and additional studies were done in the 1990s. Since 2000, a collaborative Mexican-United States team has been conducting excavations and recovery at the site, which continue.

==Layout==
Mayapan is 4.2 square kilometers (about 1.6 square miles) and has over 4000 structures, most of them residences, packed into this compound within the city walls. Built-up areas extend a half kilometer beyond the city walls in all directions. The stone perimeter wall has twelve gates, including seven major gates with vaulted entrances. The wall is 9.1&amp;nbsp;km (about 5.65 miles) long and is roughly ovate with a pointed northeast corner.

The ceremonial center of the site is located in Square Q of the city's grid in the center of the wider western half of the walled enclosure. The ceremonial center has a tightly packed cluster of temples, colonnaded halls, oratories, shrines, sanctuaries, altars, and platforms (for oration, dancing, or stela display). A.L. Smith, an archeologist with the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institute]], estimated 10‚Äì12,000 people lived within the walled city.

According to Dr. Bradley Russell's survey outside the city walls, there were numerous additional dwellings and he revised the total population estimate to between 15,000‚Äì17,000 people. His survey results are posted online at [http://www.mayapanperiphery.net www.mayapanperiphery.net]. People living outside of the city wall engaged in agriculture, animal-raising, and specialized activities such as lime production. Russell also found a colonnaded hall outside the city wall, revealing much is still to be discovered regarding the complexity of this urban landscape.

The Temple of [[Kukulcan]], a large pyramid also known as the Castillo, is the main temple in Mayapan. It is located immediately to the east of the Cenote Ch'en Mul, which has caves radiating from it. In form, the Temple of Kukulcan (Structure Q-162 on the site map) is a radial four-staircase temple with nine terraces; it is generally similar to the Temple of Kukulcan at the earlier site of [[Chichen Itza]]. However, the Mayapan temple appears to be an inferior imitation of the one at Chichen Itza, and the city's buildings in general are not constructed as well as those in other Mayan cities. For example, most or all of the vaulted roofs in Mayapan have collapsed, while many of the better-built buildings at Chichen Itza remain intact. Other major temples in the ceremonial center include three round ones, which are unusual for the Maya area and are also linked to the deity Kukulkan/Quetzalcoatl in his wind god (Ehecatl) aspect. Unlike Chichen Itza, Mayapan has no [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]].

The extensive residential zones of the site are composed of dwellings and ancillary domestic structures, with those around the ceremonial district larger and of higher quality and those toward the fringes being generally poorer. The houses are often arranged in small patio groups surrounding small courtyards. Houses were built haphazardly without organized streets. Lanes wind among the residences and walls.  The residential areas of the site contain many cenotes, perhaps as many as 40. Settlement was the most dense in the southwestern part of the city where cenotes are more numerous.

==Historical overview==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
[[File:Mayapan Panorama.JPG|alt=A panorama of the Mayapan excavations from the top of the Castle of King Kukulcan.|center|thumb|800x800px|A panorama of the Mayapan excavations from the top of the Castle of King Kukulcan.]]
The ethnohistorical sources&amp;nbsp;‚Äì such as Diego de Landa's ''Relacion de las Cosas de Yucatan'', compiled from native sources in the 16th century&amp;nbsp;‚Äì recount that the site was founded by Kukulcan (the Mayan name of [[Quetzalcoatl]], the [[Toltec]] king, culture hero, and demigod) after the fall of Chichen Itza. He convened the lords of the region, who agreed to found a new capital at Mayapan. The lords divided the towns of Yucat√°n among them, and chose the chief of the [[Cocom]] family as their leader.

The ethnohistorical sources recount multiple different histories of the rise and fall of Mayapan (Roys 1962). These histories are often confusing, chronologically implausible, and difficult to reconcile. For example, some sources say that the Maya revolted in 1221 against the Maya-Toltec lords of Chichen Itza. After a short civil war, the lords of various powerful cities and families met to restore a central government to Yucat√°n. They decided to build a new capital city near the town of Telchaquillo, hometown of [[Hunac Ceel]], the general who defeated the rulers of Chichen Itza. The new city was built within a [[defensive wall]] and named ''Mayapan'', meaning "Standard of the Maya people".

The chief of the Cocom family, a rich and ancient lineage that had taken part in the revolt against Chichen, was chosen to be king, and all the other noble families and regional lords were to send members of their families to Mayapan to play parts in the government (and perhaps act as hostages for the good behavior of the subsidiary cities). Mexican mercenaries from Tabasco were also employed to keep order and maintain power.  Another family, the Xiu, may have been living in the Mayapan area prior to the arrival of the Cocom; the Xiu claim to be a part of the lineage from [[Uxmal]]. This arrangement lasted for over 200 years. (An alternative account is given in a Maya chronicle from the Colonial era, claiming that Mayapan was contemporary with Chichen Itza and [[Uxmal]] and allied with those cities, but archeological evidence shows this version to be less likely.)

Mayapan became the primary city in a group of allies that included much of the northern Yucat√°n, and trade partners that extended directly to [[Honduras]], [[Belize]], and the Caribbean island of [[Cozumel]], and indirectly to Mexico.  Though Mayapan was ruled by a council, the ''Jalach winik'' and the ''aj k‚Äôin'' (the highest ruler, and the high priest) dominated the political sphere. Below the two primary officials were many other officials with varying responsibilities. The range of classes went from the nobility, down to slaves, with intermediary classes in between. The social climate of Mayapan was made complicated by the antagonistic relationship between the factions of nobles, which were often arranged by kinship (Pugh 2009; Milbrath 2003). In 1441, [[Ah Xupan]] of the powerful noble family of Xiu became resentful of the political machinations of the Cocom rulers and organized a revolt. As a result, all of the Cocom family, except one who was away in Honduras conducting trade, were killed, Mayapan was sacked, burned, and abandoned, all the larger cities went into decline, and Yucat√°n devolved into warring city-states.

Archaeological evidence indicates that at least the ceremonial center was burned at the end of the occupation. Excavation has revealed burnt roof beams in several of the major buildings in the site center.

==Excavations and investigations==
[[File:Mayapan chac.JPG|thumb|The Temple Redondo with a Mayan carving in the foreground.]]
In 1841 John L. Stephens was the first to document parts of the Mayapan site with two important illustrations. The first was of the Q-152 round temple, and the second was of the Pyramid of Kukulkan. He was the first in a long string of explorers who drew the ruins of Mayapan. The first large-scale archeological site surveys were not conducted until 1938 by R.T. Patton. These surveys mapped the main plaza group and the city wall, and were the basis of later maps (Russell 2008).

In the 1950s, archaeologists of the [[Carnegie Institution]], including [[A. L. Smith]], Robert Smith, [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]], [[Edwin Shook]], [[Karl Ruppert]] and [[J. Eric Thompson]] conducted five years of intensive archeological investigations at Mayapan. Their work was published in a mimeographed series of ''Current Reports''. The ''Current Reports'' have recently been republished in their entirety by the University of Colorado Press (John Weeks 2009). The final report was published by the Carnegie Institution as ''Mayapan, Yucatan, Mexico'', by [[H. E. D. Pollock]], [[Ralph L. Roys]], A. L. Smith, and Tatiana Proskouriakoff (1962, Publication 619). Robert Smith published a two-volume monograph on ''The Pottery of Mayapan'' in 1971 (Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology 66, Harvard University).

In the early 1990s, [[Clifford T. Brown]] of [[Tulane University]] carried out excavations in the residential zones of Mayapan as part of his doctoral dissertation research. Several years later, the [[National Institute of Anthropology and History]] (INAH) of Mexico began extensive architectural excavations and consolidation under the direction of archaeologist [[Carlos Peraza Lope]]. This work continues to the present. It has resulted in the discovery of many important artifacts, murals, stuccoes, and architectural elements.

From 2001 to 2009, further investigations were begun at the site by a team under the direction of Dr. [[Marilyn Masson]] from the [[State University New York at Albany]], Carlos Peraza Lope of INAH, and Timothy S. Hare of [[Morehead State University]]. This "Economic Foundations of Mayapan" (PEMY) Project performed mapping, surface survey and collection, test-pitting, and horizontal excavation across the city. Major findings of this project include the identification of diverse occupational specialization among the city's commoners, who worked as craftsmen, conscripted military personnel, farmers, and domestic servants. Great variation is now recognized in the types of work performed by commoners of different households and their degrees of affluence. This project has also identified a probable major market plaza in Square K (between the site center and major north gate D); Richard Terry, Bruce Dahlin, and Daniel Bair have analyzed soil samples from this location to test the function of this locality. In 2008 and 2009, the PEMY project focused excavations on an outlying ceremonial group by the far eastern city gate (Gate H), known as ''Itzmal Ch'en,'' as part of its study of the economic and social links between governing elites and distant neighborhoods within the city.

==Chronology==
[[File:Mural mayapan.JPG|thumb|This mural partially survives in the Sala de los Frescos in Mayap√°n. In it appears a solar disk with the figure of a deity, possibly representing one of the transit of Venus that happened in years 1152 or 1275.]]

===Before Mayapan===
* Some evidence suggests overlapping occupation of the area by different cultures. Shook in 1954 said that there may have been a [[Puuc]] "city" somewhere near Mayapan prior to its post-classical settlement. The mixture of Puuc pot sherds in the lower parts of Mayapan lots may support this, but it is a very small percentage of the material (2% in most cases and no more than 4% in others).

===Site chronology based on ceramics===
* According to Robert Smith, the ceramicist for the Carnegie Institution, there were two ceramic phases in Mayapan: ''hocaba,'' which he said started around A.D. 1200 and may have included types named Mama Red and Navula Unslipped, more commonly associated with southern lowland settlements. (Milbrath and Pereza argue that the Hocaba phase starts in A.D. 1100, which fits better with the chronology of the southern lowland sites.) The second phase is ''Tases'', which has some overlapping typology with the ''Hocaba'' phase.

===Site chronology based on radiocarbon dates===

====Middle Preclassical Date====
:In an alley fill between the Templo Redondo and an adjoining hall, some charcoal was found that yielded a calibrated date of 540‚Äì820 B.C. But, most of the pottery in this fill was post-classical. Researchers think that this sample represented old charcoal that predated the context in which it was found.

====Terminal Classical Dates====
:A burial found on bedrock in the houselot soils of a post-classical ''solare'' dated between A.D. 600 and A.D. 780. The burial appeared to be a secondary interment, and could not be completely excavated because it intruded into a wall. There was no pottery with the burial; midden samples in this area suggest occupation prior to the construction of the post-classical houselots.

:Charcoal was found on the upper floor of one of the temples that was dated to A.D. 770-1020. Researchers think that this sample is not associated with the context in which it was found. The construction fill as well as the upper floors were of post-classical age.

===Early Mayapan occupation===
* Three separate samples form the frame for early Mayapan occupation. These dates are A.D. 990‚Äì1170. However, two of these dates come from inexact sources. One was burned copal found in an unknown structure (apparently the label had eroded off of the structure); the researchers inferred that it was Q-95. The early date would suggest that this temple was built and in use in Mayapan's early history.
* Carbon dating of the pits below what was assumed to be Q-97 (again the label had eroded) dated from A.D. 990‚Äì1180.
* Charcoal found in the early construction phase of the site's main pyramid was dated A.D. 1020‚Äì1170. This sample was found in reliable context and is presumably the most accurate. It is important for suggesting that the post-classical phase in Mayapan started earlier than A.D. 1200.

===Late Mayapan occupation===
* Mayapan's settlement pattern radiated outwards to its fringes over time; many of the later dates are from materials outside of the main group of ruins. The fall of the city is tentatively dated around A.D. 1461, based on the lack of construction of altars and burial cists after this date. (Lope et al. 2006). According to [[Diego de Landa Calderon]] (1524 - 1579), the city was abandoned following the country's enslavement by a certain chieftain of the Yucatecan nation (in collusion with a garrison of [[Mexica]] Indians), and which abuse eventually led to internecine war, culminating in the city's demise in ''circa'' 1441.&lt;ref&gt;Diego de Landa Calderon, ''Yucat√°n before and after the Conquest'', 1937 (reprinted in 2008) See: [http://www.kidbots.com/MATH/YUCATAN_BEFORE_AND_AFTER.pdf Abridged History of Yucatan], pp. 38-41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/maya/ybac/ybac12.htm ''Yucat√°n Before and After the Conquest''], by Diego de Landa.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mayapan Yucatan Mexico'', H.E.D. Pollock, Ralph L. Roys, T. Proskouriakoff &amp; A. Ledyard Smith, Publication 619: Carnegie Institution of Washington, Washington, D.C. 1962, (Introduction) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kukulcan's Realm: Urban Life at Ancient Mayap√°n'', Marilyn Masson &amp; Carlos Peraza Lope, University Press of Colorado 2014, chapter 8: ''Militarism, Misery and Collapse'' {{ISBN|978-1-60732-319-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agriculture and animals==
[[Milpa]], or mixed, fields may have been cultivated when Mayapan was inhabited. There is evidence that the area around Mayapan was regularly used for slash-and-burn agriculture. Cenotes and underground limestone canals serve as the only source of freshwater in this area, making them essential to support agriculture. Researchers have suggested that Mayapan was an import/export center, and that they often traded luxury goods, such as cotton, salt, and honey, for products of obsidian and metal, which they would have forged. (Paris 2008) (Melbrath &amp; Peraza 2003:29). Today farmers use mixed fields, called milpa fields, to cultivate maize, beans, squash, watermelons, mangoes, papayas and other crops. Also, citrus fruit such as oranges and limes are often grown within the domestic house groups of the local residents (Russell 2008:16).

Faunal remains indicate that the local population used varying methods of animal acquisition. A study done by M.A. Masson and C. Peraza Lope in 2008 looked at faunal remains from two different middens, one located in the monumental center by some houses, and the other is located in the domestic area outside the monumental compound. The largest samples of recognized remains within the monumental center were from: white-tailed deer (23%), dog (4.4%), turkey (12.9%), and iguana (10.2%). The combined contributions of fish make up around 1.2% of the samples. These percentages as well as the ones that will follow for the settlement zone are based on recognized remains. Primary animals may have made up larger portions of the diet but their remains are too difficult to recognize.

In the settlement zone, researchers  found: white-tailed deer (8.4%), dog (1.4%), turkey (5.3%), iguana (14.5%), and fish (3.6%). Both turtle and rabbit remains were found in both sites, but they were consumed in small amounts (less than 1.5%). While excavating, the researchers noted many fish skeletons, but few fish heads. They concluded that the fish were being traded into Mayapan, and not collected near the site. If the fish had been prepared at the site, the heads would have been common refuse. Within the ceremonial center, numerous deer heads and teeth were found among the remains.(M.A. Masson, C. Peraza Lope 2008).

==Trade==
[[File:Mayapan2.jpg|thumb|Columned hall, seen from the Kukulkan pyramid.]]
Mayapan was a major capital in the Yucat√°n, and there is extensive evidence that it had far-reaching trade routes, as seen in architecture and artifacts of other settlements in the region.  A wide variety of goods were traded, including maize, honey, salt, fish, game, cloth, and birds.

===Peten===
Zacpeten on Lake Salpeten&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Incense burners found at this site are nearly identical to those found at Mayapan. The temple assemblages at Zacpeten are very similar to those at Mayapan. Topoxte in Lake Yaxha, Peten also shares similarities of architecture and artifacts of effigy censers. Topoxte architectural remains show a similar stone carving style to Mayapan. Also, tiny ‚Äúdwarf‚Äù shrines found at this site were very similar to shrines found at Mayapan. The two sites appear to have been abandoned around the same time; which may suggest a connection between their governments.

===Highland Guatemala===
Architectural and artifact connections are seen between Mayapan and the [[Utatlan]] in highland Guatemala. Examples are similar temple assemblages, the presence of skull imagery and squatting figures, extensive and lavish use of stucco combined with crude masonry, and effigy figure censers.

===Yucatan East Coast===
This region also shows apparent influence of Mayapan, in similar temple assemblages, similarities in architecture, effigy censers at some sites, and parallels between architectural decoration at Mayapan and some east coast sites. The east coast sites exported products such as cotton, salt, and honey from the Yucat√°n. Sites in Guatemala traded back cacao. [[El Chayal]] in Guatemala was the only source of the obsidian found at Mayapan.

===Aztecs, Central Mexico, and the Campeche Coast===
The presence of Matillas Fine Orange ceramics in Mayapan suggests trade with Tabasco. This area may have mediated trade between Mayapan and the rest of Central Mexico. Sculptures and murals at Mayapan suggest that there was contact between Mayapan and the rising Aztec empire. Some Mayapan figures showed details of Aztec dress, and what appears to be an Aztec deity is carved on an altar in Mayapan.

This evidence suggests a: ‚Äúcircum-Yucatecan trade route that linked Mayapan to Peten, northern Belize, and east-coast sites in the Late Postclassic period.‚Äù (Melbrath &amp; Peraza Lope 2003:24‚Äì31)

==Symbolism==
* The symbolism present in Mayapan is particularly significant, partially because the center of the site is mainly used for ritual purposes. There are many similarities between the murals in Mayapan and the art and iconography of the Aztec and Mixteca-Puebla regions. Symbols that they have in common include:
:* the sun disc (there are varying interpretations of what this represents
::* Could represent the sun god
::* However, the diving posture of the figure within the disc is a common motif used to represent a dead warrior, and because the figure is represented bound and with his heart removed it has been interpreted as a representation of a warrior sacrificed to the sun god.
:* representations of Quetzalcoatl
:* murals in structure Q.80 show reptile iconography which has been interpreted as participation in Mixteca-Puebla traditions. The dentition of the reptile indicate that they are serpents. There are similar representations found at Coba and on some pottery in Cholula dated to circa 1350‚Äì1550 AD.

(Milbrath, Susan., Carlos Peraza Lope, Miguel Delgado K√∫. 2010)

* Serpent iconography is very common at Mayapan, serpent balustrade carvings are common throughout the ritual center in the complexes that are associated with the Cocom lineage like the Castillo (Milbrath, Susan., Carlos Peraza Lope, Miguel Delgado K√∫ 2010). In contrast depictions of the rain god Chaac are common to the temples related to the Xiu lineage. (Milbrath 2009:583) There are also depictions of the Monkey-man god
* Most of the iconography in Mayapan is found either in murals on the temple walls, stone carving, or carved stone covered in plaster.

==Evidence of inequality==
Directionality may have played a role in the representation of inequality among the powerful factions of Mayapan. East and west were of primary importance because it represented the track of the sun through the sky. The east was associated with: life, males, and heat; whereas the west was associated with: death, females, and cold. This has led many sources to believe that the Itza and the Xiw may have been associated with east and west. There was very little evidence for obvious separation of residence between classes. This is mostly due to the residential center of Mayapan being located around the concentration of the water filled cenotes. Most residences are tandem structures made of several building within a separating wall. Many of these tandem structures include multiple residential buildings; the size of these residential buildings, relative to each other, suggests that some of them were for slaves. The integration of classes extends to the outer edges of the residential areas probably due to the convenience of being close to the agricultural fields. Some sources indicate that the analysis of oratarios or god-houses (large house-like shrines) show boundaries that were known to the people of Mayapan. This is shown in relation to the analysis of household oratarios and those oriented around the ceremonial center of Mayapan. Unfortunately there is very little skeletal evidence found in this region because of the composition of the soil. The goods found in different house structures do suggest different levels of social status, mainly in regard to the specialization of housing structures. There are at least two examples of obsidian workshops in Mayapan. The strongest evidence for inequality in Mayapan is found in the presence of deep shafts full of sacrificial victims, this suggests that the noble class had enough power to condemn some people to death.

==Abandonment==
The site of Mayapan was abandoned sometime in the 15th century. There has been some dispute over when the actual abandonment took place. However, written records state that the site was abandoned in A.D. 1441. There appear to be several contributing factors to the abandonment of Mayapan. Around A.D. 1420 a riot was started by the Xius against the Cocom which culminated in the death of nearly all (if not in fact all) of the Cocom lineage.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Pestilence may have been involved in the subsequent abandonment of the site by the remaining Xiu inhabitants. There were several sources of evidence to support this interpretation. Evidence of burned wood was found inside of structure Y-45a as well as burned roofing material on many of the other structures that was dated to around the time of the collapse in K‚Äôatun 8 Ahua (roughly A.D. 1441‚Äì1461). A mass grave in the main plaza, and bodies in a burial shaft covered in ash were dated to around the collapse and showed signs of violence, some of the bodies still had large flint knives in their chests or pelvises, suggesting ritualized sacrifice. Smashed vessels litter the floors of the Y-45a complex that date to around A.D. 1270‚Äì1400, prior to the documented collapse of Mayapan. A vessel bearing the glyph K‚Äôatun 8 Ahua was found on the floor of this complex. From this they have posited that the complex was abandoned finally when the city fell (Lope 2006; Milbrath 2003). After A.D. 1461 there is little evidence of altars and burial cists being constructed after 1461, suggesting that the site had been abandoned by this point (Lope 2006). Very little evidence has been found to support later usage of Mayapan. Copal from an altar was found in the Templo Redondo compound that may suggest later pilgrimages to the Castillo de Kukulkan. However, these samples date to the industrial era and may not be valid, so any assumptions based on this evidence would also not be valid (Lope 2006:168).

'''Medell√≠n''' ({{IPA-es|me√∞eÀà ùin}} &lt;small&gt;or&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-es|me√∞eÀà éin|}}; {{IPA-esdia|meÃû.√∞eÃûÀà…üÕ° ùin|local}}), officially the '''Municipality of Medell√≠n''' ({{lang-es|Municipio de Medell√≠n}}), is the [[List of cities in Colombia|second-largest city]] in [[Colombia]] and the capital of the department of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]]. It is located in the [[Aburr√° Valley]], a central region of the [[Andes Mountains]] in South America. According to the [[National Administrative Department of Statistics (Colombia)|National Administrative Department of Statistics]], the city has an estimated population of 2.5 million {{As of|2017|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="NADS"/&gt; With its surrounding area that includes nine other cities, the [[Metropolitan Area of Medell√≠n|metropolitan area of Medell√≠n]] is the second-largest urban agglomeration in Colombia in terms of population and economy, with more than 3.7 million people.

In 1616 the Spaniard Francisco Herrera Campuzano erected a small indigenous village ("''poblado''") known as "[[Lawrence of Rome|Saint Lawrence]] of Aburr√°" (''San Lorenzo de Aburr√°''), located in the present-day [[El Poblado (Medell√≠n)|El Poblado]] commune. On 2 November 1675, the [[queen consort]] [[Mariana of Austria]] founded the "Town of [[Virgin of Candelaria|Our Lady of Candelaria]] of Medell√≠n" (''Villa de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Candelaria de Medell√≠n'') in the An√° region, which today corresponds to the center of the city (east-central zone) and first describes the region as "Medell√≠n". In 1826, the city was named the capital of the [[Department of Antioquia]] by the National Congress of the nascent [[Republic of Gran Colombia]], comprised by present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama. After Colombia won its independence from Spain, Medell√≠n became the capital of the Federal State of Antioquia until 1888, with the proclamation of the [[Colombian Constitution of 1886]]. During the 19th century, Medell√≠n was a dynamic commercial center, first exporting gold, then producing and exporting coffee.

At the beginning of the 21st century the city regained industrial dynamism, with the construction of the [[Medell√≠n Metro]] commuter rail, liberalized development policies, improved security and improved education. Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have lauded the city as a pioneer of a post-[[Washington consensus]] "[[Developmental state#Local Developmental State|local development state]]" model of economic development.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Milford Bateman, Juan Pablo Duran Ort√≠z and Kate Maclean 2010.

==Toponymy==
The valley and its Spanish settlement have gone by several names over the years, including ''Aburr√° de los Yames√≠es'', "Valley of Saint Bartholomew", "Saint Lawrence of Aburr√°", "Saint Lawrence of An√°", ''Villa de la Candelaria de Medell√≠n'', and finally "Medell√≠n".&lt;ref name="Woods2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Woods|title=Bradt Colombia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-xoZwlNgYGAC&amp;pg=PA315|date=20 January 2012|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-364-1|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Medell√≠n" comes from [[Medell√≠n (Spain)|Medell√≠n, Spain]], a small village in the [[Badajoz]] province of [[Extremadura]]. The village is known for being the birthplace of [[Hern√°n Cort√©s]]. The Spanish Medell√≠n, in turn, was originally called "Metellinum" and was named after the Roman General [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius]] in 75 BC who founded the village as a military base.&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.medellin.es/psituacion.htm |title = Ayuntamiento de Medell√≠n (Espa√±a). Topon√≠micos de Medell√≠n |language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the [[Conquistadors]], such as [[Gaspar de Rodas]], the first governor of Antioquia, came from the region of [[Badajoz (province)|Badajoz]]. Count Pedro Portocarrero y Luna, President of the Council for the West Indies (''Consejo de Indias''), asked the [[Monarchy|Spanish monarchy]] to give the name of his town, Medell√≠n in Extremadura, to the new settlement in America. His request was accepted on November 22, 1674, when the [[Regent]] Mariana of Austria proclaimed the city's name to be ''Villa de Nuestra Se√±ora de Medell√≠n''. Miguel Aguinaga y Mendiogoitia, Governor, made the name official on November 2, 1675. The Crown granted a coat of arms to the city on June 24, 1676.&lt;ref name="origin"/&gt;

==History==

===Spanish discovery of the valley===
[[File:Retrato de Jorge Robledo.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Marshal Jorge Robledo]]

In August 1541, [[Jorge Robledo (conquistador)|Marshal Jorge Robledo]] was in the place known today as [[Heliconia, Antioquia|Heliconia]] when he saw in the distance what he thought was a valley. He sent Jer√≥nimo Luis Tejelo to explore the territory, and during the night of August 23 Tejelo reached the plain of what is now Aburr√° Valley. The Spaniards gave it the name of "Valley of [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Saint Bartholomew]]", but this was soon changed for the native name ''Aburr√°'', meaning "Painters", due to the textile decorations of the natives.&lt;ref name="restrepo"&gt;Restrepo Uribe, Jorge (1981), Medell√≠n, su Origen, Progreso y Desarrollo, Servigr√°ficas, Medell√≠n. {{ISBN|84-300-3286-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1574, Gaspar de Rodas asked the [[Department of Antioquia|Antioquia's]] [[Cabildo (council)|Cabildo]] for {{convert|4|mi2|km2|order=flip|0|sp=us}} of land to establish herds and a ranch in the valley. The Cabildo granted him {{convert|3|mi2|km2|order=flip|0|sp=us}} of land.&lt;ref name="restrepo"/&gt;

In 1616, the colonial visitor Francisco de Herrera y Campuzano founded a settlement with 80 Amerindians, naming it ''Poblado de San Lorenzo'', today "[[El Poblado, Medell√≠n|El Poblado]]". In 1646 a colonial law ordered the separation of Amerindians from [[mestizo]]s and [[mulatto]]s, so the colonial administration began the construction of a new town in An√°, today [[Berr√≠o Park]], where the church of ''Nuestra Se√±ora de la Candelaria de An√°'' ("Our Lady of Candelaria of An√°") was built. Three years later, the Spaniards started the construction of the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Candelaria]], which was rebuilt at the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="restrepo"/&gt;

===Growth of the town===
[[File:Catedral de Medell√≠n-Fachada P.jpg|240px|left|thumbnail|[[Metropolitan Cathedral of Medell√≠n]].]]

After 1574, with Gaspar de Rodas settled in the valley, population started to grow. According to the church records of the San Lorenzo Church, six couples married between 1646 and 1650, and 41 between 1671 and 1675.&lt;ref name="restrepo"/&gt; Gold mines were developed northeast of Antioquia, thus they needed food supply from nearby agriculture. The Aburr√° Valley was in a strategic position between the gold mines and the first provincial capital of Antioquia, [[Santa Fe de Antioquia]].&lt;ref name="restrepo"/&gt;

The provincial capital, Santa Fe, started to lose importance and gradually became poor, as trade and prominent personalities of the region came to the Aburr√° Valley, where rich families started to buy land. Soon, the first settlers asked for the creation of a [[Cabildo (council)]] in the valley, thus getting a separate government from Santa Fe.&lt;ref name="restrepo"/&gt; The Santa Fe government fought this, but Mariana of Austria signed the edict creating the Cabildo on November 22, 1674. The governor Miguel de Aguinaga proclaimed the royal edict on 2 November 1675. The new city was given the title of ''Villa de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Candelaria'' It is the second largest city in Colombia .&lt;ref name="restrepo"/&gt;

===During the Spanish colonial period===
[[File:Plano de Medellin 1791.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Map of Medell√≠n in 1791.]]

Before the creation of the town, the inhabitants were scattered throughout the valley, with only a few families concentrated at the confluence of the An√° (today called the [[Santa Elena River|Santa Elena]]) and the [[Medell√≠n River|Medell√≠n]] rivers; others lived in El Poblado San Lorenzo. After the royal edict, the settlers chose the An√° site as the heart of the future city, with the Candelaria Church at its center. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
[[File:2018 Medell√≠n iglesia de San Ignacio.jpg|thumbnail|170px|San Ignacio Church, an example of colonial architecture in Colombia.]]

Their first buildings were simple, with [[Thatching|thatched]] roofs. The houses of the most important people were two stories tall, and the church and the Cabildo were unimpressive. It was only during the 18th century that the church was improved. Only one story, the Cabildo was located at the western part of the plaza. It had a thatched roof until 1742, when tiles were put on. In 1682, traders and foreigners started the construction of the [[Iglesia de la Veracruz (Medell√≠n)|Veracruz Hermitage]], which was consecrated as a church by the Bishop of [[Popay√°n]] in 1712.&lt;ref name="restrepo"/&gt;

In 1675, the first census during colonial times was taken: there were 3,000 people and 280 families. Another census was not taken until the colonial Visitador (royal inspector) [[Antonio Mon y Velarde]] ordered one between 1786 and 1787: there were then 14,507 people and 241 families. In 1808, two years before Colombia won independence, the city had 15,347 people and 360 families.&lt;ref name="restrepo"/&gt;

In 1803, the Royal College of the Franciscans was founded in the Central Plaza, which is [[Berr√≠o Park]] today, with the initial departments of Grammar, Philosophy and Theology.&lt;ref&gt;'"Suramericana de Seguros", in ''History of Antioquia,'' Ed. Presencia Ltda, Medell√≠n, 1988, without ISBN, in Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the college moved to a new building in the small San Ignacio square. In 1821 it was renamed Colegio de Antioquia, and it became the [[University of Antioquia]] in 1901. The University also had the first vocational training school, the first cultural radio station in Latin America, and the first regional [[botanical garden]].

===Industrial revolution===
In the first half of the twentieth century, the population of Medell√≠n increased sixfold, from 59,815 inhabitants in 1905 to 358,189 in 1951. The [[Thousand Days War]] (1899‚Äì1902) stopped the industrial development of the city, although the civil war did not affect the region directly. Under reforms by President [[Rafael Reyes]] after the conflict, the city continued its industrial development&lt;ref name="restrepo"/&gt; and founded a [[Chamber of commerce]].  The Chamber developed a regional transport project that connected Medell√≠n to other Colombian regions and other nations.

Despite the importance of gold production in the early development of Medell√≠n, the export of coffee contributed the most impetus in the 20th century for the city's growth. Trade grew to international dimensions as the main export of Colombia became [[Coffee production in Colombia|coffee]]. The industrial and commercial dynamism of Medell√≠n also created a caste of traders and entrepreneurs, who founded the first nationwide industries in Colombia.&lt;ref name="restrepo"/&gt;

===Trade in Medell√≠n===
[[File:Parque Berr√≠o Medell√≠n.jpg|upright|thumb|right|190px|[[Coltejer Building]], the tallest building in Medell√≠n.]]
[[Coltejer]] is one of the most important textile companies in Colombia. It was founded in Medell√≠n by Alejandro Echavarr√≠a on October 22, 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Compa√±√≠a Colombiana de Tejidos (''Colombian Textile Company'') Coltejer: [http://www.coltejer.com.co/empresa.htm History of the Company] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612045409/http://www.coltejer.com.co/empresa.htm |date=2007-06-12 }}, [[Itag√º√≠]], Colombia, Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Its headquarters, the [[Coltejer Building]], is the tallest skyscraper in Medell√≠n and the fourth tallest building in Colombia.

The discovery of coal in [[Amag√°]], a few kilometers south of the Aburr√° Valley, and the building of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric plants]] provided the new industries with energy, and this allowed the creation of many smaller companies. The Antioquia Railway (built in 1875) conquered the difficult geography of one of the most mountainous regions of South America, notably with the [[La Quiebra Tunnel]], which connected the industrial center to the [[Magdalena River]], the most major navigable river in Colombia. In 1932 Medell√≠n also built its first airport, the [[Enrique Olaya Herrera Airport]].&lt;ref name="restrepo" /&gt;

The study by Charles H. Savage on industrial production in Antioquia between 1960 and 1972 showed how important Medell√≠n industries became to Colombia and South America. He studied social change produced by the introduction of new technology. Savage looked at three factories in Antioquia: two potteries in [[Santuario]] and [[La Blanca (Colombia)|La Blanca]], and a tailoring factory in Medell√≠n. Savage studied the production of the Antioquian factories, and the relationship between the workers and their employers, an industrial efficiency which he called the "Culture of Work".&lt;ref&gt;Savage presented his thesis ''Factories in the Andes: Social Organization in a Developing Economy'' for his PhD in Business Administration at [[Harvard University]] in 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; His conclusions were published by his colleague [[George F. Lombardi]] as ''Sons of the Machine'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Savage|first1=Charles H., Jr.|last2=Lombard|first2=George F.

===Art in the early 20th century===
Arts and literature have been an important social element in Medell√≠n. The [[University of Antioquia]], the [[National University of Colombia]] with its Medell√≠n branch, and the [[Pontifical Bolivarian University]] have historically been the academic centers of the city and are responsible for the formation of an intellectual class in the region.

During the first part of the 20th century the city was part of the literary transition from [[romanticism]] to the modern art and literary movements of the new century. {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} The writer [[Tom√°s Carrasquilla]] (1858‚Äì1940)  focused on the people of his native Antioquia, portraying their daily lives and customs. The writer and philosopher [[Fernando Gonz√°lez (writer)|Fernando Gonz√°lez]] from [[Envigado]] (in the metropolitan area of Medell√≠n), the cartoonist [[Ricardo Rend√≥n]] and the poet [[Le√≥n de Greiff]] were some of the founders of ''Los Panidas'', a Medell√≠n literary movement. Other featured poets and writers were [[Porfirio Barba-Jacob]] and [[Efe G√≥mez]]. In painting, the most famous were [[Eladio V√©lez]] and [[Pedro Nel G√≥mez]]. [[Carlos Vieco Ortiz]] was a popular composer and musician. Medell√≠n became the headquarters of record labels like Sonolux, Ondina and Silver.&lt;ref name="restrepo"/&gt;

Medell√≠n clubs, many of them dating to the end of the 19th century became a center for intellectual and industrialist movements, like Club Union (founded in 1894) and Club Campestre (founded in 1924). In 1909 the Circo Espa√±a was created, and Bol√≠var Theater, in 1919. The Jun√≠n Theater was demolished to build the [[Coltejer Tower]]. Cine Colombia, the first movie distributor of the country, was founded in Medell√≠n in 1927.&lt;ref name="restrepo"/&gt;

===Growth in second half of 20th century===

Colombia entered a new era of political instability with the murder of presidential candidate [[Jorge Eliecer Gait√°n]] in [[El Bogotazo|Bogot√°]] in 1948. Political violence spread in the rural areas of Colombia, and farmers fled to the cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-weimar.de/architektur/raum/doktoranden/sanchez_Migracion_forzada_urbanizacion_en_Colombia.pdf|title=Migracion forzada y urbanizacion en Colombia|author=Lina Mar√≠a S√°nchez Steiner|publisher=Seminario Internacional "Procesos Urbanos Informales"|date=October 31 ‚Äì November 2, 2007|accessdate=December 6, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000520/http://www.uni-weimar.de/architektur/raum/doktoranden/sanchez_Migracion_forzada_urbanizacion_en_Colombia.pdf|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Valley slopes became overpopulated with slums.

As the population of Medell√≠n grew quickly during the 1950s, industrialists, traders and local government created the "Medell√≠n Master Plan" (MMP) (''Plan Piloto''), a plan for the expansion of the city into the Aburr√° Valley that would lead to the creation of the first metropolitan area in Colombia. [[Paul Lester Wiener]] and [[Jos√© Luis Sert]] were the architects who led the project. Among the main features of the MMP were the canalization of the [[Medell√≠n River]], the control of new settlements on valley slopes, the creation of an industrial zone in the Guayabal District, the planning of the city to be in harmony with the river, the construction of a city stadium, and an administrative center in [[La Alpujarra Administrative Center|La Alpujarra]].&lt;ref name="restrepo"/&gt;

In 1951 the city had 358,189 inhabitants, but 22 years later, in 1973, the population had tripled to 1,071,252.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalurban.org/GUDMag07Vol3Iss1/Betancur.htm|title=Approaches to the Regularization of Informal Settlements: the case of primed in Medell√≠n, Colombia|publisher=Global Urban Development Magazine (Volume 3, Issue 1)|author=John J. Betancur|date=November 2007|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population explosion had several consequences for the MMP. The urban limits of the city grew to areas that were not contemplated in the MMP, so that Medell√≠n now reached the urban areas of other cities of the Aburr√° Valley, like [[Envigado]], [[Bello, Antioquia|Bello]] and [[Itag√º√≠]]; the new Medell√≠n settlers were poor families without enough credit to buy their own homes, so several neighborhoods were built beyond the MMP; several old downtown buildings were demolished to construct tall towers, offices, and avenues. The beautiful and traditional Junin Theatre along the Santa Elena was demolished to build the Coltejer Tower. The huge migration into Medell√≠n provided workers for the expansion of textile factories, being modernized in this period,&lt;ref name="restrepo"/&gt; but it also created new problems for the city: higher unemployment, lack of services for poor areas, urban violence in several districts, and collapse of any hope of a transport system. {{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Today===
 [[File:View of Medell√≠n at night.JPG|thumb|right|View of Medell√≠n at night|283x283px]]
The position of Medell√≠n as the second industrial city in Colombia has been a main factor in overcoming its crisis of the 1980s and 1990s. The [[Medell√≠n Metro]], a massive urban transport service, became the pride of the city, and so far the only sign of the Medell√≠n Master Plan of the 1950s. The construction of the [[Plaza Mayor, Medell√≠n|Plaza Mayor of Medell√≠n]], an international center for congresses and expositions, was designed to showcase the [[Globalization|globalized]] economy of Colombia to the world. 

Social exclusion has eased due to the development of a transport infrastructure; the Metro, a new system of public buses, is being planned with the so-called "Metroplus", already inaugurated, and gondolas called ‚ÄúMetroCable‚Äù in the poorest barrio communities.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Additionally, an electric escalator 1,260 feet long was inaugurated on December 26, 2011 in Comuna 13, one of Medell√≠n's poorest neighborhoods, making it one of the first of its kind in the world. Today's Medell√≠n includes spaces for art, poetry, drama, the construction of public libraries, the foundation of new ecological parks, and the inclusion of people of the city in its development.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Alcantara: [http://www.decolombia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=35 Colombia‚Äôs Medell√≠n: City transformed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430044447/http://decolombia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=35 |date=2008-04-30 }}, February 23, 2008.

In 2012, Medell√≠n was among 200 cities around the world, including New York and Tel Aviv, nominated for Most Innovative City of the Year due to a great advancement in public transportation, with more than 500,000 residents and visitors using its Metro train system each day; a public bike-share program; new facilities and landmarks, including the Espa√±a Library and a cultural center in Moravia; a large outdoor escalator the size of a 28-story building, enabling residents of the city‚Äôs elevated Comuna 13 neighborhood to safely ride down the steep hillside; and a Metro system which reduces Medell√≠n‚Äôs CO2 emissions by 175,000 tons each year.&lt;ref name="Online.wsj.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/ad/cityoftheyear# |title=City of the Year ‚Äî Sponsored by Citi |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2009-10-28 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medell√≠n has the biggest research-dedicated building in Colombia called University Research Building ({{lang-es|Sede de Investigaci√≥n Universitaria, SIU}})&lt;ref&gt;http://siu.udea.edu.co {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820063710/http://siu.udea.edu.co/ |date=2008-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a facility that concentrates the top research groups of the [[University of Antioquia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.udea.edu.co |title=Universidad de Antioquia |publisher=Udea.edu.co |accessdate=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Medell√≠n has 16 ''[[comuna]]s'' (districts), 5 ''[[corregimiento]]s'' (townships), and 271 ''[[barrio]]s'' (neighborhoods).
The metropolitan area of Medell√≠n lies within the Aburr√° valley at an elevation of {{convert|1,500|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]] and is bisected by the [[Medell√≠n River]] (also called Porce), which flows northward. North of the valley are the towns of [[Bello, Antioquia|Bello]], [[Copacabana, Antioquia|Copacabana]], [[Girardota]] and [[Barbosa, Antioquia|Barbosa]]. To the south of the valley lie [[Itag√º√≠]], [[Envigado]], [[Sabaneta, Antioquia|Sabaneta]], [[La Estrella, Colombia|La Estrella]] and [[Caldas, Antioquia|Caldas]].

===Climate===

The weather in Medell√≠n is warm year-round with few temperature extremes. As a municipality, Medell√≠n has an area of {{convert|382|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.  Medell√≠n features a [[tropical rainforest climate]] (''Af''), albeit a noticeably cooler version of this climate that borders closely on a [[subtropical highland climate]] (''Cfb'') and also on a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (''Am''). Because Medell√≠n is located at {{convert|1500|m|-2|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]], its climate is not as hot as other cities located at the same latitude near the equator. Because of its altitude [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and privileged location in the Andes Range, Medell√≠n's weather at times is more characteristic of a [[humid subtropical climate]] than that of a [[tropical climate]]. The city's average annual temperature is {{convert|22|¬∞C|0|abbr=on}}, and because of its proximity to the equator, its temperature is constant year round, with minimal temperature variations. Temperatures range from {{convert|15|to|30|C|F|abbr=on}}. Because of the pleasant springlike climate all year, Medell√≠n is known as "La Ciudad de la Eterna Primavera" or "City of the Eternal Spring". However, as the city is located in a valley and many of its districts are on slopes, temperatures can be slightly cooler on the surrounding mountains.

==Administrative divisions==

[[File:Corregimientos de Medellin.png|thumb|right|''Corregimientos'' (townships, rural areas) of Medell√≠n]]

Medell√≠n is a city governed by a [[republicanism|republican]] democratic system as stated in the [[Colombian Constitution of 1991]], with decentralized government. Administration is shared by the [[Mayor of Medell√≠n]] and the Municipal Council, both elected by popular vote.

The municipality is made up of official departments (''secretar√≠as'') including departments for social mobility, urban culture, social development, education, evaluation and control, government, resources, public works, administrative services, environment, women, and transportation. There are also many departments with a certain autonomy: the [[Olaya Herrera Airport]], the Public Library (''Biblioteca P√∫blica Piloto''), the College of Antioquia (''Colegio Mayor''), the Urban Development Enterprise (EDU), the Public Service Enterprise (EEPPM), the Sport and Recreation Institute (INDER), the General Enterprises of Medell√≠n (EEVVM), the Medell√≠n Bus stations, the General Hospital of Medell√≠n, the health service enterprise "Metrosalud", the Metropolitan Institute of Technology (ITM), the [[Metro de Medell√≠n]], the Department for the Administration of the Medell√≠n parks (Metroparques) and Metroseguridad.

The municipality is divided into six zones: The urban zone, which is subdivided into 16 ''[[commune (Medell√≠n)|comunas]]'' (communes).  The communues are further divided into 249 statistical neighborhoods. The remaining zones outside the urban zones comprise five ''[[corregimiento]]s'' (townships).

Further, the municipality belongs to the [[Medell√≠n Metropolitan Area]], which is made up of ten neighboring municipalities.

==Law and government==
The government of the city of Medell√≠n is divided into executive and [[legislative]] branches. The [[List of mayors of Medell√≠n|mayor]] of the city (Alcalde) is publicly elected for a term of four years (just like the president and the governor of any other department in Colombia).

===Local development state===
[[File:Gobernaci√≥n de Antioquia2.jpg|250px|thumbnail|La Alpujarra offices the mayor of the city and the governor of the [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] department.]]
Low tax rates mean Medell√≠n's city administration's social and economic development policies have been funded by the city's ownership of the main energy supplier, Empresas Publicas de Medell√≠n (EPM); 30% of its profits go directly to the city's administrative budget.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; In addition to infrastructure projects, the city administration has developed a program of cash grants called 'the Medell√≠n Solidaria' programme that are very similar to [[Brazil]]'s highly successful [[Bolsa Familia]] and also the city runs the Cultura E programme.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

According to the city administration, Medell√≠n Solidaria represents an improvement on Colombia's national programme, 'Familias en Accion' (Families in Action).&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; The city administration is further responsible for coordinating more than 100 other social programmes.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Under the Cultura E programme, the city administration has established a network of 14 publicly funded business support centres known as CEDEZO, Centros de Desarrollo Empresarial Zonal).&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; The CEDEZOs are found in the poorest areas of Medell√≠n and support the poor in developing business by providing free-of-charge business support services and technical advice.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

Also, as part of Cultura E, there is Banco de las Oportunidades that provides [[microloans]] (up to $2,500 at a cheap interest rates 0.91% monthly).&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; This has helped create more equal opportunities for all and overcome the barriers to entry to business for poor entrepreneurs with good ideas, but lacking capital, skills and connections.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; It has also helped develop the local economy with new micro-enterprises.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

However, several mayoral candidates for the October 2011 elections have argued the Banco de las Oportunidades's interest rates are too high, loan maturity is too short and it should have [[grace period]]s.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; They therefore suggest a new [[Small and Medium-sized Enterprise|small and medium-sized enterprise]] (SME) development bank to complement the Banco de las Oportunidades.

As the home of the [[Medell√≠n Cartel]] funded by [[Pablo Escobar]], the city was victim of the terror caused by the war between the organization headed by Escobar, and competing organizations such as "El Cartel del Valle". However, after the death of Escobar, crime rates in the city have decreased dramatically.&lt;ref name="Fuego cruzado en Medell√≠n."&gt;BBC. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_2337000/2337667.stm "Fuego cruzado en Medell√≠n."] October 17, 2002. BBCMundo.com. May 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the rest of the 1990s crime rates remained relatively high, although gradually declining from the worst years.  In October 2002, President [[√Ålvaro Uribe]] ordered the military to carry out "Operation Orion", the objective of which was to disband the urban militias of the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]] and the [[Self-Defense Units of Colombia|AUC]].&lt;ref name="Fuego cruzado en Medell√≠n."/&gt; Between 2003 and 2006 the demobilization of the remaining urban militias of the AUC was completed, with more than 3,000 armed men giving up their weapons.&lt;ref name="EspinalAgudelo2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Espinal|first1=Manuel Alberto Alonso|author2=Germ√°n Dar√≠o Valencia Agudelo|format=PDF|url=http://aprendeenlinea.udea.edu.co/revistas/index.php/estudiospoliticos/article/viewFile/1941/1600|title=Balance del proceso de Desmovilizaci√≥n, Desarme y Reinserci√≥n (DDR) de los bloques Cacique Nutibara y H√©roes de Granada en la ciudad de Medell√≠n|trans-title=Overview of the Process of Demobilization, Disarmament and Re-integration (DDR) in the Cacique Nutibara and H√©roes de Granada Blocks in the City of Medell√≠n|language=es|journal=Estudios Pol√≠ticos|issue=33|date=July‚ÄìDecember 2008|accessdate=14 November 2016|issn=0121-5167|pages=11‚Äì34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless after the disbanding of the main paramilitary groups, many members of such organizations have been known to have reorganized into criminal bands known commonly as [[Aguilas Negras]] ("Black Eagles"). These groups have gained notoriety in Medell√≠n for calling upon curfews for the underage population, and have been known to distribute fliers announcing the social cleansing of prostitutes, [[drug addicts]], and [[alcoholics]].&lt;ref&gt;Caracol Radio. [http://www.caracol.com.co/nota.aspx?id=542060 "Las '√Åguilas Negras' anuncian limpieza social en un sector de Medell√≠n".] Enero 31 de 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The extradition of paramilitary leader [[Diego Murillo Bejarano|Don Berna]] appears to have sparked a crime wave with a sharp increase in killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cipcol.org/?p=644 |title=Medell√≠n minus the 'Leviathan' |publisher=Plan Colombia and Beyond |date=29 July 2008 |accessdate=27 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930142327/http://www.cipcol.org/?p=644 |archivedate=30 September 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As home of the now defunct [[Medell√≠n Cartel]], the city was once known as the most violent city in the world.&lt;ref name=Borrell/&gt; However, its homicide rate has decreased by 95% and extreme poverty by 66%, thanks in part to a string of innovative mayors who laid out plans to integrate the poorest and most violent hillside neighborhoods into the city center in the valley below. Medell√≠n is now considered safer than the US cities of Baltimore, St. Louis, Detroit and New Orleans, which appear in the [[List of cities by murder rate|CCSPJP's top 50]] list.&lt;ref name="seguridadjusticiaypaz"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.seguridadjusticiaypaz.org.mx/biblioteca/prensa/send/6-prensa/231-caracas-venezuela-the-most-violent-city-in-the-world|title= List of cities by murder rate|publisher=seguridadjusticiaypaz.org.mx|accessdate= 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a significant disparity in crime rates by neighborhoods, with virtually no homicides in [[El Poblado]] to areas with open gunfights in the outskirts. Generally, crime rates increase the further the neighborhood is from the center.&lt;ref name=llworldtour &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llworldtour.com/2011/02/24/my-run-in-with-the-policia/ |title=Policia and Crime in Medell√≠n, Colombia |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2010 and 2011, homicides have declined as with crime in general, but there remains a high crime rate in the poorest communities.

==Economy==
[[File:Edificio Bancolombia - luces.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Headquarters of Bancolombia, the largest commercial bank in Colombia and one of the largest in Latin America, in Medell√≠n.]]
Medell√≠n is one of Colombia's economic centers. Its economy is led by a powerful group of people from the private sector known as the [[Grupo Empresarial Antioque√±o]] (Antioquian Enterprises Group). The group was formerly known as the ''Sindicato Antioque√±o'' (Antioquian Union) but after being mistaken abroad for a labor union, which hampered its international growth for many years, a new formal name was chosen. It is represented by David Bojanini, head of Grupo Suramericana (a banking, asset management and insurance conglomerate); Carlos Ignacio Gallego of [[Grupo Nutresa]] (food industry); Jos√© Alberto Velez of [[Argos (cement company)|Cementos Argos]] (a multinational cement company); and Carlos Ra√∫l Yepes, head of [[Bancolombia]]. This group has an aggregate market capitalization of approximately US $17 billion and employs more than 80,000 Colombians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suleasing-intl.com/Colombia/ColGrupoSura.asp |title=Grupo Empresarial Antioque√±o |trans-title=Business Group of Antioquia |language=es |publisher=suleasing-intl.com |accessdate=15 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623194443/http://www.suleasing-intl.com/Colombia/ColGrupoSura.asp |archivedate=23 June 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This group also participates in other sectors of the city industry and is an active trader in the Colombian stock exchange. Medell√≠n serves as headquarters for many national and multinational companies.

Medell√≠n's main economic products are steel, textiles, [[confection]]s, food and beverage, agriculture (from its rural area), [[public services]], chemical products, pharmaceuticals, refined oil, and flowers. Fashion is a major part of the economy and culture of the city. Medell√≠n hosts Latin America's biggest fashion show, [[Colombiamoda]].

The [[Metropolitan Area of Medell√≠n]] contributes 67% of the total GDP of the Department of Antioquia and 11% of the [[economy of Colombia]].&lt;ref name="ProExport16"/&gt; Antioquia is the second-greatest economic region of Colombia. By 2005, Antioquia's GDP was more than US$14,700,000,000 and the top exporting province in Colombia.&lt;ref name="revista-semana-1329"&gt;Revista Semana (2007): "Ruta Empresarial", en Semana, vol.

The 2005 Report of the Economic Colombian Review of Proexport and the International Cooperation Agency of Medell√≠n concluded that Medell√≠n was at the same level of GDP contribution to the national economy as cities like [[Panama City]] in Panama, and [[San Jos√© de Costa Rica]].

===Medell√≠n Cluster===
Medell√≠n created the first Colombian [[business cluster]]. The city is the top exporting region of the country, with 1,750 export businesses based in Medell√≠n.&lt;ref name="revista-semana-1329"/&gt; The Cluster was created with the support of the Chamber of Commerce of Medell√≠n and the City Administration for an actual total of 21,000 companies that share 40% of total exports, 25% of the regional GDP, and 40% of Metro Area employment.&lt;ref name="revista-semana-1329"/&gt; The main economic activities of the Medell√≠n Cluster (MC) are in [[electricity generation]], textile, fashion design, construction, tourism and business.&lt;ref&gt;C√°mara de Comercio de Medell√≠n.

[[Ruta N]] is a non-profit in Medell√≠n which helps foreign companies set up office in Medell√≠n.

===Unemployment and poverty===
According to data released by the Measuring Monetary Poverty and Inequality Mission (Spanish: ''Misi√≥n para el Empalme de las Series de Empleo, Pobreza y Desigualdad'', MESEP), in November 2009, the poverty rate in Medell√≠n and its metropolitan area was reduced by 22.5%, from 49.7% to 38.5% during the period from 2002 to 2008. Similarly, the poverty rate decreased by 25.2%, from 12.3% to 9.2%. These results are in line with the increased coverage of basic services such as health, education, and public services in the city. In 2014, the poverty rate decreased to 14.7% and extreme poverty to 2.8%.&lt;ref name="dane.gov.co"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dane.gov.co/files/investigaciones/condiciones_vida/pobreza/bol_pobreza_14_.pdf |title=Data |website=www.dane.gov.co |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unemployment rate in Medell√≠n and its metropolitan area, as has been the case in Colombia as a whole, has decreased in the past decade. According to data from the National Statistics Department (Spanish: Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estad√≠stica, DANE) unemployment for Medell√≠n and its Metropolitan Area was reduced by 25%, from 14.1%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.dane.gov.co/index.php/mercado-laboral/empleo-y-desempleo|title =DANE - Encuesta Continua de Hogares Total 13 ciudades y √°reas metropolitanas Promedio 12 meses enero - diciembre (2001 - 2006)|date =|access-date =February 1, 2016|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160201162223/https://www.dane.gov.co/index.php/mercado-laboral/empleo-y-desempleo|archivedate =February 1, 2016|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; just above the national average of 13.9% in 2005 to 10.6%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dane.gov.co/files/investigaciones/boletines/ech/ech/bol_empleo_dic_15.pdf|title = DANE - Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares (GEIH) Enero - Diciembre 2015|date = |access-date = February 1, 2016|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; above the national average of 9.9%, in 2015. However, according to DANE, in 2014 Medell√≠n stood out as one of the most unequal cities of Colombia, with a GINI coefficient of 0.506.&lt;ref name="dane.gov.co"/&gt;

==Urban development==
There are signs of heavy urban development within the city of Medell√≠n, particularly with the construction of new skyscrapers. Medell√≠n is currently outpacing all other major Colombian cities, including Bogot√°, in the construction and proposed development of new high-rises. As of October 2016, there were 10 skyscrapers, 410 high-rises, 119 buildings under construction in Medell√≠n, including 48 being planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emporis.com/city/101122/medellin-colombia|title=Medell√≠n|publisher=emporis.com|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other projects that the city has planned are extensions of the cities metro system to nearby suburbs such as Sabaneta. Currently under construction, the new project is set to open to the public soon.

Medell√≠n was awarded 2013 "Innovative City of the Year" by the Wall Street Journal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/02/medellin-named-innovative-city-of-the-year_n_2794425.html |title=Medellin, Colombia Named ‚ÄòInnovative City Of The Year‚Äô In WSJ And Citi Global Competition |last=Moreno |first=Carolina |website=Huffington Post |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131019220603/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/02/medellin-named-innovative-city-of-the-year_n_2794425.html |archivedate=19 October 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=8 March 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on March 1 after beating out New York City and [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/ARTICULO-WEB-NEW_NOTA_INTERIOR-12627468.html|title=Medell√≠n, la m√°s innovadora - Archivo Digital de Noticias de Colombia y el Mundo desde 1.990 - eltiempo.com|publisher=|access-date=2013-03-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420231447/http://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/ARTICULO-WEB-NEW_NOTA_INTERIOR-12627468.html|archive-date=2013-04-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comprehensive urban projects===
When [[Sergio Fajardo]] became Mayor of Medell√≠n in 2004, the "Medell√≠n, Commitment of all the Citizens" plan for the city was enacted. One of its fundamental axes was described as "Social Urbanism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fajardo|first=Sergio|title=Medell√≠n, transformaci√≥n de una Ciudad|year=2008|publisher=Alcald√≠a de Medell√≠n|location=Medell√≠n}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final objective of this model was to promote peace and social equity through its urban policies. To accomplish this, priority was given to the areas of the city where bigger social and economic issues were found. The main tool used with this objective was the planning and development of urban projects that would transform the physical environment while promoting profound social and cultural shifts in the communities they were implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SCA|title=La transformaci√≥n de Medell√≠n, urbanismo social 2004 - 2007|url=http://socearq.org/index.php/actividades/debates/la-transformacion-de-medellin-urbanismo-social-2004-2007.html|publisher=Sociedad Central de Arquitectos|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The projects were identified and prioritized using six main guidelines as described in the City Plan by the Council of Medell√≠n:&lt;ref name="Alcald√≠a de Medell√≠n 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alcald√≠a de Medell√≠n|title=Plan de Desarrollo 2004-2007: Medell√≠n, Compromiso de Toda la Ciudadan√≠a|year=2004|publisher=Alcald√≠a de Medell√≠n|location=Medell√≠n}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
* The indicators of human development and quality of life will guide the public investment, focusing on first serving the ones in the biggest need. 
* Public space and infrastructure must become the framework where education and culture are cultivated in places of encounter and coexistence. 
* Urban projects must simultaneously integrate physical, cultural and social components; improving not only places but also the life and interactions of people in the communities. 
* The Integrated Metropolitan Transport System must be used as the organizing axis of mobility and projects in the city. All projects have to be directly linked to the main transport system.
* The decision to make Medell√≠n an educated city. Education and culture as priorities that guide programs and projects.

[[File:Biblioteca Espa√±a(1)-Medellin.JPG|thumb|230px|[[Spain Library (Medell√≠n)|Spain Library]], located in the 1st commune.]]
The main objective of these projects is to fight inequity and exclusion. The neighborhoods with the biggest inequity and violence issues are identified and important investments are made in them. There is no previous agenda over what the specific nature of the interventions will finally be since the projects use a communicative approach to define what is best for the community with the active participation of its members.&lt;ref name="Alcald√≠a de Medell√≠n 2004"/&gt; The outcomes will depend on what the neighborhood decides supported by the inclusion of the expertise of city organizations. The projects will have to incorporate all the elements needed to foster development and will be executed simultaneously to assure the biggest impact.

Aside from usual city investment in public infrastructure and as a result of this approach to city development, there were four main concrete projects that were established to help achieve the objectives of peace and social equity based on the guidelines proposed in the Medell√≠n City Plan by the Council of Medell√≠n.&lt;ref name="Alcald√≠a de Medell√≠n 2004"/&gt;

===Libraries and "library parks"===
[[File:Biblioteca Leon de Greiff-Exterior4-Medellin.JPG|thumb|left|230px|[[Le√≥n de Greiff Library]]]]
{{Main article|Library park (Colombia)}}
A "library park" ({{lang-es|Parque biblioteca}}) is a term first used in Medell√≠n for an urban complex formed by a combination of a library building with ample surrounding green space for public use. These library parks are strategically located in the periphery of the city to address the need for more cultural and education space and public services in less affluent neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Catal√°n2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manuela Agudo Catal√°n|title=El romanticismo en Arag√≥n (1838-1854): literatura, prensa y sociedad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wk2JqkAfwScC&amp;pg=PA94|accessdate=16 August 2013|year=2008|publisher=Universidad de Zaragoza|isbn=978-84-7733-137-7|pages=94‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of library complexes and schools is part of an effort at cultural transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Melguizo|first=Jorge|title=La transformaci√≥n de Medell√≠n desde la Cultura|year=2008|publisher=Secretar√≠a de Cultura de Medell√≠n|location=Medell√≠n}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project also aims to create centralities inside the intervened areas that help consolidate and give a clearer identity to the communities. They are meant to provide a network of activity centers for the promotion of education, culture, sport, and recreation.

The initial plan in 2009 built five libraries with attached parks to serve underprivileged neighborhoods. The most famous of this development was possibly the [[Biblioteca Parque Espa√±a]] designed by [[Giancarlo Mazzanti]],.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americalate.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/col-parquebibliotecaespana-545px.jpg Americalate, fotograf√≠a nocturna del Parque Biblioteca Espa√±a] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018101940/http://www.americalate.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/col-parquebibliotecaespana-545px.jpg |date=2015-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americalate.com/2009/09/24/medellin-una-ciudad-que-busca-reposicionarse/|title=americalate.com|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which was named after [[Spain]], who helped fund the construction of one of its buildings. Architects of the other libraries added as part of the program include [[Ricardo La Rotta Caballero]] and [[Hiroshi Naito]]. The four other libraries added were [[Le√≥n de Greiff Library]] (also known as La Ladera Library Park), [[San Javier Library Park]], [[Bethlehem Library Park]], and [[La Quintana Library Park]].

After the initial 2009 program another five libraries were added to the plan for 2011. These libraries are the [[Doce de Octubre Library Park]] for Comunas 5 and 6, Noroccidente; [[Las Estancias Library Park]] for Comunas 8, 9, and Centroriental; [[Parque Biblioteca Guayabal]] for Comuna 15 and Suroccidente; Parque Biblioteca San Crist√≥bal] for Corregimiento and Occidente; and Parque Biblioteca San Antonio de Prado for Corregimiento and Sur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pbfernandobotero.blogspot.com/p/conoce-el-parque-biblioteca.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130307193109/http://pbfernandobotero.blogspot.com/p/conoce-el-parque-biblioteca.html |archivedate=2013-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of "library parks" has served as a model for library spaces in other countries, most notably the [[Manguinhos Library Park]] in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

[[File:Bteca epm.JPG|250px|thumbnail|right|EPM Public Library]]
The Medell√≠n Metropolitan Area Library Network is a set of libraries linked together to share resources, efforts, knowledge and experience to improve the educational and cultural conditions of the community. The network consists of over 100 libraries, 29 of which reside in Medell√≠n.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Libraries|url=http://www.reddebibliotecas.org.co/bibliotecas|website=Library Network|publisher=Red de Bibliotecas|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Library Network includes all of Medell√≠n's library parks, as well as other regional libraries, such as the Public Pilot Library and the EPM Library.

The Library Network was a program created as a metropolitan agreement in 2005 thanks to an alliance of [[Empresas P√∫blicas de Medell√≠n]], its EPM Foundation, the Mayor of Medell√≠n, and the Pilot Public Library. In 2009, the Library Network was awarded the "Access to Learning Award" by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], consisting of one million dollars to the EPM Foundation and the Library Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colombian Organization Receives ATLA - Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2009/08/Colombian-Organization-Receives-ATLA|publisher=Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation|accessdate=13 September 2015|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional libraries outside of this network include several other private, public, and university libraries.

===Architecture===
[[File:Punto cero de Medell√≠n.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Point Zero Bridge, decorated with a [[plumb-bob]], symbolizes the center of the city.]]
{{Main article|Architecture of Colombia}}
Medell√≠n in 2013 won the Veronica Rudge Green Prize in Urban Design, awarded by [[Harvard University]], due to PUI Integral Urban Project Northeast area, designed and implemented by Development Corporation Urbano. Medell√≠n retains very little colonial architecture from the nineteenth century. Although the Aburr√° Valley was a hotspot in agriculture and livestock throughout the colonial period, their relative wealth is not expressed in an outstanding and Cartagena, Tunja, Popay√°n and Bogot√° civil and religious architecture. This can be explained by the fact that the population of Medell√≠n was not political and administrative center and a place geographically isolated whose elite invested little in the development of monumental architecture. From the end of the colony remain, but with many transformations, the Candelaria Church and the Church of the Veracruz.

[[File:2018 Medell√≠n fachada de la iglesia de La Veracruz.jpg|thumb|The Church of the Veracruz remain, but with many transformations, from the end of the colony.]]
The architecture produced in Colombia between 1850 and 1930 is called "Republican". The use of brick and implementation of European historical styles were the main novelty. Enrique Haeusler designed the Guayaquil Bridge in 1879. But it was the French architect Carlos Carr√© who headlined Republican nineteenth century architecture in Medell√≠n. Carr√© came to town in 1889 and was hired to design and build the new Episcopal Cathedral and several commercial and residential buildings for different parts of the city, especially in the new neighborhood of Guayaquil. The Metropolitan Cathedral was completed in 1931; also are of authorship V√°squez and Carr√© buildings, which are located next to [[Plaza Cisneros]]. The Medell√≠n Antioquia Railway Station was the work of Enrique Olarte, a work that allowed the definitive urban consolidation in Guayaquil sector. In the twenties Republican architecture reached its peak phase. In this period stand the old Municipal Palace (now the Museum of Antioquia) in 1928, the National Palace and the Palace of Departmental Government (now the Palace of Culture) between 1925 and 1928. The latter two works were designed by the Belgian architect [[Agust√≠n Goovaerts]], both inspired by the Belgian modernist, it applied the Romanesque and Gothic styles respectively. Other works of Goovaerts were the Church of the Sacred Heart (sector Guayaquil), the Church of San Ignacio, among others. The thirties highlighted such constructions of the Prado neighborhood as the Egyptian house and the current Teatro Prado.

===Parks===
The main parks of the city include [[Berr√≠o Park]] in the center of the city; [[Bol√≠var Park (Medell√≠n, Colombia)|Bol√≠var Park]], a little further north and framed by the Metropolitan Cathedral; and others in more residential areas like Bethlehem Park, El Poblado Park, and Laureles Park. Several modern parks are interactive and have had a positive reception from the people because they are not only places of recreation but also of education. These include Barefoot Park, Wishes Park, [[Explora Park]], and Bicentennial Park (which was recently opened to mark the bicentenary of Colombia).

One of the most visited sites is the [[Arv√≠ Ecotourism Park]], which has an area of about 20,000 hectares, covers virtually the entire territory of the village of [[Santa Elena (Medell√≠n)|Santa Elena]], and runs between the towns of [[Bello, Antioquia|Bello]], [[Copacabana, Antioquia|Copacabana]], and [[Envigado]]. In its trails, lakes, forests and streams, one can practice various sports and activities like trekking, kayaking, biking, camping, fishing, swimming, sailing rowing, horseback riding, bike tours and picnics. Its promontory position over Medell√≠n offers natural landscapes overlooking over the entire city. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The city is surrounded from above by seven hills, which serve as natural viewpoints of the city and are sites for healthy leisure, recreation, enjoyment, research, sport, culture, education and ecotourism. The hills are El Volador, La Asomadera, [[Nutibara Hill|Nutibara]], Pan de Az√∫car, El Salvador, El Picacho and Santo Domingo. In these natural public spaces one can find viewpoints, pre-Hispanic roads, religious icons, culture and Antioquian traditions, bird watching, the most complete herbal living of [[Aburr√° Valley]] and the remains of early settlers native of Medell√≠n, among other attractions.

Other parks in the city include North Park and Juan Pablo II Park. The Santa Fe Zoo, founded in 1960, has about 1,000 animals from Asia, Africa, and the Americas.

Medell√≠n universities, public and private, also played a role, along with official institutions both local and national.

==Transportation==

===Air transportation===
[[File:2018 aeropuerto internacional Jos√© Mar√≠a C√≥rdova, vista a√©rea.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|[[Jos√© Mar√≠a C√≥rdova International Airport]]]]

Medell√≠n has one domestic airport, [[Olaya Herrera Airport]] (EOH), and one domestic and international airport, [[Jos√© Mar√≠a C√≥rdova Airport]] (MDE), which is located in the city of [[Rionegro]], {{convert|29|km|abbr=off}} east of the city of Medell√≠n. In 2012 the busiest domestic flight route was between Jose Maria Cordova Airport and [[Bogot√°]] while the busiest international route was between Jose Maria Cordova Airport and [[Panama City]].

The [[Jos√© Mar√≠a C√≥rdova International Airport|Jose Maria Cordova Airport]] receives international flights from important carriers such as [[American Airlines]], [[Copa Airlines]], [[JetBlue]] and [[LAN Airlines|Lan Airlines]], which makes the city accessible from the many regions of America. [[Avianca]], the flag air-carrier of Colombia, has also an important activity at this airport.

===Land transportation===
Medell√≠n has two transportation terminals, the North Transportation Terminal and the South Transportation Terminal. The city's public transport system includes diesel buses, taxis, tram and an urban train referred as the [[Medell√≠n Metro]], the only metro system in Colombia.

[[File:Metro de Medellin- Linea B sector San Javier.JPG|200px|thumbnail|[[Medell√≠n Metro]] is the only [[metro system]] in Colombia.]]
The Metro connects the city with most of its metropolitan area. It has five lines. Line A goes from [[Niqu√≠a station|Niqu√≠a]] to [[La Estrella station|La Estrella]] (north to south), while Line B goes from [[San Antonio station (Medell√≠n)|San Antonio]] to [[San Javier station|San Javier]] (downtown to west). In addition, Line K and Line J, an air cable car, locally known as [[Metrocable (Medell√≠n)|Metrocable]], serve a depressed and geographically difficult area. Line K begins at Acevedo Station on Metro Line A, and continues uphill, ending at Santo Domingo Savio. Line J begins at San Javier Station on Metro Line B, and continues uphill to La Aurora. Line L does not serve communal areas, rather, it is a tourist-oriented line which is connected to [[Arv√≠ Park]] and is part of a social project to bring retreats and nature to the masses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Metrocable (Medell√≠n)#cite note-4]]&lt;/ref&gt; Colombia has become Latin America's largest user of such complementary transportation service throughout the country.

[[File:Tunel de Occidente.jpg|thumb|left|Western Tunnel, the longest and most modern tunnel of Latin America.|250px]]
In 2006, construction began on Metropl√∫s, a [[bus rapid transit]] service with a dedicated road, much like Bogot√°'s [[TransMilenio]], to allow faster transit for the service's buses. The first line opened two years later than planned in 2011 and a second in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medell√≠n BRT data|url=http://www.brtdata.org/#/location/latin_america/colombia/medellin|publisher=Embarq|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first leg is the ''Troncal Medell√≠n'', which goes from the Universidad de Medell√≠n in the west to Aranjuez in the northeast part of the city. Metroplus will help lessen the city's pollution and traffic, as many old buses will be taken out of service, while the new buses will work with natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metroplus.gov.co/metroplus/index.php?sub_cat=41&amp;idx=11&amp;ap=8 |title=Metropl√∫s acerc√≥ a los visitantes del #FMB4 con los artistas de la bicicleta &amp;#124; Metropl√∫s |publisher=Metroplus.gov.co |date= |accessdate=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Estacion Santo Domingo Savio-Metro de Medellin.JPG|thumb|150px|right|[[Metrocable (Medell√≠n)|Medell√≠n's Metrocable]] at Santo Domingo Savio station.]]
Because of its projects on sustainable transport, the city obtained, along with San Francisco, the 2012 Sustainable Transport Award, given by the Institute for Transport and Development Policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable Transport Award|author=ITDP|url=http://www.itdp.org/get-involved/sustainable-transport-award/previous-award-recipients/medellin-colombia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831112418/http://www.itdp.org/get-involved/sustainable-transport-award/previous-award-recipients/medellin-colombia|archivedate=2013-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to EMBARQ Director Holger Dalkmann, "Medell√≠n pioneered the use of cable cars as a transit alternative in low-income informal settlements in hilly areas, moving 3,000 passengers per hour per direction; a real breakthrough now being replicated in Caracas and Rio de Janeiro,"

The Colombia and Latin America's largest and most modern tunnel, the Western Tunnel, officially named the Fernando Gomez Martinez Tunnel, is located between Medell√≠n and Santa Fe de Antioquia. It is {{convert|4.6|km|0|abbr=on}} in length and offers security and service technologies for the users. It was inaugurated on January 20, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caracol.com.co/noticias/actualidad/fue-inaugurado-el-tunel-de-occidente-en-antioquia-el-mas-grande-de-latinoamerica/20060120/nota/240088.aspx|title=Fue inaugurado el T√∫nel de Occidente en Antioquia, el m√°s grande de Latinoam√©rica|trans-title=The West Tunnel was inaugurated in Antioquia, the largest in Latin America|language=es|publisher=caracol.com.co|date=20 January 2006|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tunel de Occidente, Colombia |language=es |url=http://www.tuneldeoccidente.com/ |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921210719/http://www.tuneldeoccidente.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=201%3Afichatecnicareal |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, [[trams in Medellin]] were the most important transportation until 1950, but, after that, the rapidly increasing population and number of automobiles forcefully closed it in 1951. However, more than 60 years later, a new [[Translohr]] system (rubber-tired "tram"), the [[Ayacucho Tram]], the first modern "tram" in Colombia, was opened on September 30, 2015. It is integrated with the metro system and the local bus network.

====Public transportation statistics====
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Medell√≠n, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 66 min. 12% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 14.% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 5.9&amp;nbsp;km, while 5% travel for over 12&amp;nbsp;km in a single direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medell√≠n Public Transportation Statistics|publisher= Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|url=https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Colombia_Medellin-1642|accessdate=June 19, 2017}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aburr√° Valley contains 58% of the population of the [[Department of Antioquia]], and 67% of the Aburr√° Valley population lives in the city of Medell√≠n. Of the inhabitants of Medell√≠n, 61.3% were born in the city, 38% in other parts of Colombia and 0.3% in another country.&lt;ref name="DANE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dane.gov.co/files/censo2005/perfiles/perfiles.swf|title=Censo General 2005 - Perfiles Departamentales y Municipales|trans-title=General Census 2005 - Departmental and Municipal Profiles|language=es|work=[[National Administrative Department of Statistics (Colombia)|DANE]]|date=2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726041441/http://www.dane.gov.co/files/censo2005/perfiles/perfiles.swf|archivedate=26 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[National Administrative Department of Statistics]], Medell√≠n had, by 2005, a population of 2,223,078 inhabitants, making it the second largest city in Colombia. The metropolitan area of Medell√≠n in 2005 included 3,312,165 inhabitants. There are 5820 people per square kilometer in the city. There were 130,031 people living in the city townships; 46.7% of the population are male and 53.3% are female. Illiteracy is 9.8% in persons older than 5 years old. 98.8% of the households in Medell√≠n have electricity, 97.3% have drinking water, and 91% have a land-line phone.&lt;ref name="DANE"/&gt;

According to the 2005 DANE census, in that year Medell√≠n registered 33,307 births,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dane.gov.co/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=16&amp;id=36&amp;Itemid=148 DANE]: Results of births and dead.&lt;/ref&gt; slightly fewer than in 2004 (33,615). In 2005 the number of deaths was 10,828, in 2004 11,512.

===Ethnicities===
According to figures submitted by the [[National Administrative Department of Statistics|DANE]] census 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dane.gov.co/files/censo2005/PERFIL_PDF_CG2005/05001T7T000.PDF |title=Data |website=www.dane.gov.co |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[ethnographic]] makeup of the city is:

* [[Afro-Colombian|Black, mulatto, Afro-Colombian or Afro-descendant]]: 6.5%
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Amerindians]]: 0.1%
* No ethnic affiliation: 93.4%

During the 17th and 18th centuries, Medell√≠n received many immigrants from Spain{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}. Most Indigenous peoples died from the introduction of European diseases, and many of those who survived intermarried with early Spanish settlers, who were mostly men; later, Spanish women also began to immigrate. During the 19th and 20th centuries, immigrants arrived from Lebanon, Jordan, Germany, Italy and Portugal. Many people from Medell√≠n are referred to as [[Paisa Region|Paisas]], people of mainly Spanish ancestry, a lot of them Basque.
There is a small Afro-Colombian and Zambo-Colombian (people of Indigenous and African descent) population .

The [[Choc√≥ Department]] is just west of Antioquia, and is home to many Afro-Colombian and Zambo-Colombian migrants to Medell√≠n and its vicinity. Migration from the Colombian Caribbean coast has been important, especially that of young people who come to study in Medell√≠n universities and remain to work in the city. The main foreign immigration is of [[Ecuador]]ians in informal trade.

==Culture==
[[File:02-063 Palacio de la Cultura Rafael Uribe Uribe.JPG|thumb|200px|left|[[Rafael Uribe Uribe Palace of Culture]]]]
The culture in Medell√≠n is strongly linked to a broader Paisa culture (see next section) whose unique attributes famously include their Spanish accent, cuisine, and hospitality. Today, Medell√≠n has several cultural attractions for the public including approximately 40 museums, 21 public parks, 28 theaters, and several public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medellin.travel/en/where-can-i-go|title=Where can I go?|publisher=Medell√≠n Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau|accessdate=5 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127010605/http://www.medellin.travel/en/where-can-i-go|archivedate=27 January 2012|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city also contains several [[National Monuments of Colombia]].

[[File:La Raza de Rodrigo Arenas Betancur-Medellin.JPG|thumb|left|200px|''La Raza'' Monument, by [[Rodrigo Arenas|Rodrigo Arenas Betancur]]. It is located in La Alpujarra Administrative Center.]]

Most people in Medell√≠n are Catholic, as reflected by Medell√≠n's several churches and religious activities. Among the most representative churches are the [[Metropolitan Cathedral of Medell√≠n|Metropolitan Cathedral]], the largest cathedral in the world built entirely in baked brick. There is also the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Candelaria]], which was the official cathedral until 1931, the [[Church of San Ignacio (Medell√≠n)|Church of San Ignacio]], Baroque on the outside and Colonial on inside, the [[Church of San Jos√© (Medell√≠n)|Church of San Jos√©]], the [[Church of San Antonio (Medell√≠n)|Church of San Antonio]], which has one of the biggest domes in Colombia, the [[Church of San Jos√© del Poblado]], located in the Parque del Poblado where the first European settlement in the [[Aburr√° Valley]] was founded in 1616, and the [[Church of Nuestra Se√±ora de Bel√©n (Medell√≠n)|Church of Nuestra Se√±ora de Bel√©n]]. All of these temples have religious art and are located in the center of the city, which facilitates their journeys.

In December, the city is covered with thousands of fairy lights, creating the famous ''[[Christmas lights in Medell√≠n|Alumbrados]]'' (Christmas lights), which are considered by the [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] as one of the ten most beautiful in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Pano Plazo Botero.jpg|thumb|Plaza Botero, in the background the [[Museum of Antioquia]]|362x362px]]
[[Plaza Mayor, Medell√≠n|Plaza Mayor]] is the epicenter of large events and business. By a decree of the municipal government, between 1980 and 1990 all developments or tall buildings necessarily included a sculpture of a famous artist. That is one reason why Medell√≠n has the largest number of sculptures per square kilometer in Colombia.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Furthermore, the city has several festivals and exhibitions year-round. The [[sillero|silletero]] tradition is also closely tied to the region and is considered a part of Colombian [[cultural heritage]]. Since 1957, this tradition has continued in the Silleta Parade that takes place during the annual [[Festival of the Flowers]], where silletas designed with flower arrangements are carried.

Works of many prominent artists, both local and foreign, can be seen on the streets of the city. Some artists who stand out are the masters [[Rodrigo Arenas Betancur]] and [[Fernando Botero]].

===Paisa culture===
{{Main article|Paisa region}}
The inhabitants of Medell√≠n are often called ''Antioque√±os'' (people of Antioquia) after their province, rather than ''Medell√≠nenses'' (people of Medell√≠n) after their city. They are also often known as ''[[Paisa Region|Paisas]]'', a name which some suggest comes from the coffee growers. The term ''Paisa'' comes from the word ''paisano'', meaning "fellow countryman". ''Paisas'' make up one of the five different regional cultures within Colombia. In addition to Antioquia, the [[Paisa region]] includes the departments of [[Caldas Department|Caldas]], [[Risaralda Department|Risaralda]], [[Quindio]] and some towns of [[Valle del Cauca]] and [[Department of Tolima|Tolima]]. Although Paisa culture is dominant in Medell√≠n, the so-called "Paisa Capital", the city is becoming more cosmopolitan, now offering music from other regions of Colombia ([[Vallenato]] and [[Department of Choc√≥|Choc√≥]]), and a variety of restaurants including Chinese, Cuban, and Argentinian.

The Paisa culture has a Spanish background, and is traditionally Catholic, entrepreneurial, hard-working, and famously hospitable. Paisas are said to speak softly and quickly, to smile easily, and to love music, poetry, soccer, bargaining in the markets, and parties. They are proud of their city, and work hard to keep it clean, stemming from the campaign begun in the 1980s, "Depende tambien de ti, darle amor a Medell√≠n" (It depends on you too to give love to Medell√≠n). The Medell√≠n weekend nightlife, in discos, pubs, parks, and certain dedicated streets, is traditionally called ''rumba''.&lt;ref name="MattBrown"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Matthew|url=http://albeiror24.wordpress.com/2008/03/11/colombia-an-emerging-travel-destination/|title=Colombia: An Emerging Travel Destination|accessdate=2008-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bandeja paisa y tazon de frejoles del Chocolos 30062011.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[bandeja paisa]] is the representative food of the city and the department of Antioquia.]]
The cuisine of Medell√≠n is again tied to the larger culture of Antioquia. A typical regional dish is the [[bandeja paisa]], meaning the "paisa tray", which usually includes beans, rice, pork, or another meat, [[chorizo]], a fried egg, [[tostones|patac√≥n]]es, salad and avocado. It is traditionally served on a tray slab or wood. It is traditional to consume meals with arepas, which are made with cooked, milled, and mixed corn without further ingredients.

For breakfast, it is common to accompany the food with [[hot chocolate]] and possibly a slice of cheese to dunk in the drink. [[Parva (food)|Parva]] is a traditional component of the Antioquian gastronomy as well. This name is given to a wide variety of sweet and savory baked goods, including [[pan de queso]], [[pan de bono]], [[bu√±uelo]]s, and pastries.

Other foods that are typical in the region stem from Colombian food industries, such as [[Postob√≥n]] Colombian sodas, the regional [[aguardiente#Colombia|aguardiente]] known as ''Aguardiente Antioque√±o'', and Jet chocolate bars.

==Sports and recreation==
Football is the most popular sport and is widely played in the city. Medell√≠n has two professional clubs: [[Atl√©tico Nacional]], founded in 1935, and [[Independiente Medell√≠n]], founded in 1913.

[[File:Atanacio girardot antes de la apertura de los juegos.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Atanasio Girardot Sports Complex]]]]
A popular sport in Medell√≠n, and generally throughout Antioquia, is [[equitation|horseback riding]]; therefore, it has encouraged trade and production of tools and equipments for this activity, such as chairs and horseshoes for export. During the Festival of the Flowers, the [[cavalcade]]s achieved a [[Guinness World Record]] in 1996 and 1999.

The city also has two Colombian professional basketball teams: the [[Arriero]]s of Antioquia and the Mountain Academy.

==Symbols==
The coat of arms, flag and anthem of the city, has the recognition of official symbols of the municipality of Medell√≠n according to Decree No. 151 of February 20, 2002, and as emblems of the city are part of the corporate image of management municipal, and therefore are present in the acts, events and official media in which these should appear by its representative character.

===Coat of arms===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
The Medell√≠n coat of arms is the oldest emblem of the city, has its origins in the granting of its use by King [[Charles II of Spain]] through the [[Real Decreto]] issued in Madrid on March 31 of 1678 whose document says:

:"...A blue field coat and in then a very thick and round tower, all around her battlements and a coat of arms which has fifteen parts ‚Äì seven blue and eight gold ‚Äì and on it a crown that touches the tower, on each of the sides a smaller tower, and in between them an image of Our Lady on a cloud with her son in her arms..."

{| class="wikitable"  style="float:right; font-size:90%; line-height:120%; width:340px; margin:10px"

|align=left|&lt;small&gt;Version currently used by the Council&lt;/small&gt;
|}

However, a more refined and structured in heraldic language, though not official, would be:

:"In an [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]] field, a round tower of gold stands, masoned and clarified by sable, with a checkered escutcheon of 15 pieces ‚Äì 7 blue and 8 gold (coat of arms of [[House of Portocarrero]]) ‚Äì stamped with an ancient crown of gold between its two towers, with a cloud upon which stands the image of Our Lady of Candelaria carrying the Child in her left arm, a candle in her right hand, radiant, she is flanked by forming clouds from each county. "

[[File:Escudo de armas de medellin-1678.jpg|upright|thumb|Coat of Arms of Medell√≠n in 1678]]

The blazon has remained over time since it was granted, without further changes to the aesthetics, it is noteworthy that there are different stylistic versions between the Mayor and City Council also meets aesthetic not heraldic standards.

===Flag===
To strengthen the links with the region, the municipality adopted the [[flag of the Department of Antioquia]], which was added to the coat of arms of the city, so that these could make difference. The flag consists of two horizontal stripes of equal proportions, the white top and green bottom, and in the middle between two strips is located the coat. The white color symbolizes purity, integrity, obedience, firmness and eloquence. The green represents hope, abundance, freedom and faith.

===Anthem===
The anthem of the city of Medell√≠n is "Anthem of Antioquia", according to Decree No. 151 of February 20, 2002, Article 10, which says: "Anthem of Medell√≠n. To unify the ideals of the region the Antioquia anthem is adopted (lyrics by [[Epifanio Mejia]] and music by Gonzalo Vidal) as the Anthem of the Municipality of Medell√≠n. It will be sung in all official functions where the Mayor of Medell√≠n is present."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5505">'''Mervyn Coleridge Alleyne''' (Trinidad and Tobago, 13 June 1933 - 23 November 2016) was a [[sociolinguist]], [[creolist]] and [[dialectologist]] whose work focused on the [[creole language]]s of the [[Caribbean]]. 

He attended [[Queen's Royal College]] in [[Port-of-Spain]] and later won a scholarship to the fledgling University College of the West Indies, Mona, [[Jamaica]] which he entered in 1953.  After graduating from Mona, Alleyne obtained a PhD from the University of [[Strasbourg]], [[France]]. He returned to the University of the West Indies (UWI), Mona as a lecturer in 1959, and was made Professor of [[Sociolinguistics]] in 1982. He returned to his homeland for a brief spell and lectured at the St Augustine campus of the UWI. He was a Visiting Professor at the [[University of Puerto Rico]], R√≠o Piedras.

Upon retirement from The [[University of the West Indies]], Mona, the title of Professor [[emeritus]] was conferred on him.  He was president of the Society for Caribbean Linguistics (SCL) from 1990 to 1992 and was made an honorary member of the SCL in 1998.  He also became an honorary member of the [[Linguistic Society of America]] (LSA) in 1996.  He is a co-founder of the  [[academic journal|journal]] ''Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages''.  In 1996, a [[festschrift]] in his honour was published: ''Caribbean Language Issues, Old &amp; New: Papers in Honour of Professor Mervyn Alleyne on the Occasion of His Sixtieth Birthday'' (edited by Pauline Christie, and published by UWI Press).  In March 2007, Alleyne was the Humanities Scholar 2007 at The [[University of the West Indies]], [[Cave Hill, Saint Michael, Barbados|Cave Hill]], [[Barbados]]. In October 2011, he was the guest of honour at the special panel discussion ‚ÄúThe Interdisciplinary Scholarship of a Caribbeanist: A Tribute to Dr. Mervyn Alleyne,‚Äù an activity organized at the Institute of Caribbean Studies at the University of Puerto Rico at R√≠o Piedras. 

==Significance of his work==
Alleyne was best known as a pioneer in [[Creole language|Creole]] Studies. He was one of the few [[Caribbean]]-born participants in the second ever International Conference on Creole Languages held at [[The University of the West Indies]], Mona in April 1968, the proceedings of which were published in 1971 in ''Pidginization and Creolization of Languages'' edited by [[Dell Hymes]]. His paper ‚ÄúAcculturation and the Culture Matrix of Creolization‚Äù elaborated some of the themes which were to characterize his later work.  Alleyne disagrees with the idea that creoles necessarily develop from prior pidgins, and he explains the considerable variation among creoles as the result of differing degrees of acculturation among [[Africans]] who came in contact with [[Europe]]ans. 

Alleyne repudiated the use of the term 'creole', positing that its meaning is unclear. He carefully avoided it in his book ''Comparative Afro-American'' (1980), arguably the most quoted source on the relevant varieties. In addition to its detailed comparison of structural aspects of [[Sranan]], [[Saramaccan]], [[Jamaican Creole]], [[Guyanese Creole]], among others, this work reveals his preoccupation with the Black experience as a whole, and with the autonomy of [[Culture of Africa|Black culture]]. His fascination with the correlations between the linguistic picture and other aspects of culture, such as religion, manifests itself in ''Roots of Jamaican Culture'' (1988).

The '''Monastery of the Virgins''' is a structure uncovered during [[Benjamin Mazar]]'s excavations south of [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Temple Mount]]. The large number of Christian religious finds from the site have prompted its identification with a monastery described by a pilgrim, Theodosius the archdeacon, in his ''De Situ Terrae Sanctae'', a work of the early 6th century.&lt;ref name=maps/&gt; The building was constructed in the 4th century on the remains of an earlier [[Herodian]] building identified with the [[Second Temple]] courthouse, and was destroyed during the [[Siege of Jerusalem (614)|Persian sack of Jerusalem]] in 614.

==Excavations==
[[File:Temple Mount southern wall 200509.jpg|thumb|The southern Wall of the Temple Mount. The Monastery of the Virgins lies beyond steps leading up to the Triple Huldah Gate]]
The building identified as the Monastery of the Virgins was unearthed in Area XV&lt;ref name=xv/&gt; of Mazar's excavations of the [[Ophel]] on behalf of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Carried out between 1968 and 1977, the excavations revealed that a crowded residential neighbourhood stood in the area to the immediate south of the Temple Mount enclosure during Jerusalem's [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Period]].&lt;ref name=byzantine/&gt; {{convert|10|m|ft}} from the [[Huldah Gates|Triple Huldah Gate]], at the foot of the Temple Mount's [[southern wall]], the excavators revealed a structure whose plan resembled a typical Byzantine courtyard house, with wings arranged around a central courtyard. Built on top in the remains of a large [[Jerusalem during the Second Temple Period|Second Temple Period]] building and an older burial cave, the house featured three stories of which the basement and ground floor were well preserved.&lt;ref name=xv/&gt;&lt;ref name=guide/&gt; The excavation of the building yielded earlier [[History of ancient Israel and Judah#Iron Age II|Iron Age II]] shards, including a [[LMLK seal]] and the head of a fertility figurine. However, as a result of the building's excellent state of preservation digging beneath its floors was abandoned in order to allow its display to the public.&lt;ref name=xv/&gt;

Measuring {{convert|17.9|m|ft}} by {{convert|17.3|m|ft}}, the structure was built in the early 4th century as a single spacious unit.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt; Its ground floor included the courtyard, a kitchen, shops and staircases leading to the basement and the floor above, which housed a chapel.&lt;ref name=review/&gt; In the mid-6th century the northern and southern wings of its ground floor were modified and sealed off from the rest of the building.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;

A destruction layer testifies to the destruction of the building in a great conflagration, probably during the Persian sack of the city in 614.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; In the destruction layer were found the remnants of the upper floor, which collapsed into the floor below.&lt;ref name=bar/&gt; The remains of weapons, probably the defenders', were also found at the site. These include a sword, a scabbard, a pickaxe, a dagger and an [[Shield boss|umbo]], a rare feature of the Byzantine weapons repertoire.&lt;ref name=arms/&gt;

While adjacent areas were built over during the subsequent Islamic periods, the building in area XV was left undisturbed. This allowed for its excellent state of preservation. It is currently accessible to visitors to the Jerusalem Archaeological Park at the foot of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].&lt;ref name=bar/&gt;

===Finds===
Multiple items of ecclesiastical nature were found in the structure. These include fragments of marble [[Iconostasis|chancel screens]], an [[altar table]] and a Second-Temple era stone [[ossuary]] in use as a [[reliquary]] and containing a skull.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt; Crosses were ubiquitous, including on roof tiles, oil lamps, door knockers, and several bronze crosses, one of which was {{convert|65|cm|inch}} in length.&lt;ref name=bar/&gt; Several fragments of a chancel screen depict two deer, Christian symbols of faith and devotion mentioned in {{bibleverse||Psalms|42:2|HE}}, facing a cross planted on the Hill of [[Golgotha]]. A stone lintel was found depicting a cross enclosed within a wreath.&lt;ref name=bar/&gt;

Additional finds include copper alloy chains and incense bowls,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mazar1999|Mazar 1999, pp. 17]]&lt;/ref&gt; copper alloy lock and clasps decorated with the image of an arched entrance to a church,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mazar1999|Mazar 1999, pp. 15]]&lt;/ref&gt; a sinuous dragon-headed arm from a multi-armed copper candelabra, and a copper hearth with decorative animal legs complete with rings for suspension.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mazar1999|Mazar 1999, pp. 41-42]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the northern section of the building which included the kitchen and several storage rooms, were found multiple storage jars. In some of these were found remnants of the food they once contained, including [[lentil]] and [[chickpea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mazar1999|Mazar 1999, pp. 37]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification==

===Monastery of the Virgins===

The large number of Christian items found in the structure have led to its identification with a monastery described by Theodosius the archdeacon in his ''De Situ Terrae Sanctae'' (On the Topography of the Holy Land). Theodosius describes a monastery of nuns at the foot of the Temple Mount's southeastern corner:&lt;ref name=maps/&gt;&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;
{{quote|Down below the pinnacle of the Temple is a monastery of virgins, and whenever one of them passes from this life, she is buried there inside the monastery. All their lives they never go out of the door by which they entered this place. The door is opened only for a nun or a penitent who wishes to join the monastery, but otherwise the virgins are always shut in. Their food is let down to them from the walls, but they have their water there in cisterns.&lt;ref name=pilgrims/&gt;}}

The excavators believe that the monastery had initially occupied the entire structure. In the 5th century, however, Jerusalem was granted [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|patriarchal status]] and the following century saw the city develop and expand. As population density in Jerusalem grew, the needs of numerous pilgrims to the holy city led to a reduction in the Monastery's area in favour of public facilities. In the mid 6th century, two wings were detached from the monastery and sealed off, the northern wing to act as a public kitchen and the southern converted into a row of shops.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; Food for the monastery was prepared in the public kitchen and delivered through two windows left open between the two sections of the building.&lt;ref name=xv/&gt;

Adjacent buildings have aided the identification of the building as a monastery. {{convert|6|ft|m}} from the Temple Mount wall, behind the monastery, stood a vaulted chamber with a sloping floor. This has been identified as a collection vat for wine, above which once stood a winery, a common feature of Byzantine monasteries. A two story structure to the east of the Monastery may have served as a [[hospice]]. Thirty well-preserved rooms were found on its ground floor, as was a red cross painted on a lintel in the building, and large watering pool on the outside.&lt;ref name=bar/&gt;

While the building certainly was a monastery, certain finds nevertheless cast doubt on its identification with Theodosius' Monastery of the Virgins. Theodosius's description dates from the early 6th century, while the structural modifications isolating the central portion have only been dated to the mid 6th century, and possibly later. Furthermore, Greek inscriptions found in the building feature no women, only men, including one reading "for the offering and salvation of the Timotheus the priest".&lt;ref name=review/&gt;

The identification of the site with Theodosius' monastery was first proposed by [[Yizhar Hirschfeld]]. [[Yoram Tsafrir]] has suggested that the monastery may have been located on the slopes below of the Temple Mount which have not yet been excavated or even in the hollows of the Temple Mount itself, within [[Solomon's Stables]]. No evidence has been found to corroborate either suggestions.&lt;ref name=xv/&gt;

===Second Temple Courthouse===
Underneath the coarse stones of the Byzantine walls, the walls of the monastery were built of large finely dressed stones, plastered and molded at the joints, a feature of [[Herodian]] construction. The monastery had been built over the remains of a large Second-Temple-era building which had stood adjacent to a major entrance to the Herodian Temple Mount. Benjamin Mazar had suggested that this may have been a courthouse of the [[Sanhedrin]], the supreme Jewish judicial and legislative body, a building referred to in the [[Mishnah]], ''[[Tractate Sanhedrin]]'' 11.2. Additional support for this identification comes from a fragment of a Hebrew inscription found nearby. The inscription contained the word ''[z]kenim'' (''elders''), probably referring to the Sanhedrin.&lt;ref name=bar/&gt;

==Publication==
Although completed in 1977, the results of the Temple Mount excavations had not been published by Benjamin Mazar's death in 1995. In 1996 the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University authorized his granddaughter, [[Eilat Mazar]], to publish the finds. Eilat Mazar had been her grandfather's research assistant, an area supervisor in the nearby [[City of David]] excavations, and had directed her own excavation in the Ophel in 1986-1987. The excavation report for area XV and the Monastery of the Virgins was finally published in 2003.&lt;ref name=review/&gt;&lt;ref name=bar/&gt;

'''''Mystery Train: Images of America in Rock 'N' Roll Music''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book written in 1975 by [[Greil Marcus]]. It features critical essays centered around artists such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Sly Stone]], [[Robert Johnson]], and [[Randy Newman]].
==Authorship==
[[Greil Marcus]], rock critic and columnist for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and contributor to other publications, such as ''[[Creem]]'', the ''[[The Village Voice|Village Voice]]'', and ''[[Artforum]]'', wrote ''Mystery Train'' in 1975. In the prologue, he relates that the book "is no attempt at synthesis, but a recognition of unities in the American imagination that already exist."&lt;ref name=gre&gt;Marcus (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; The writing, according to the author, took about "two years of doing nothing else."&lt;ref name=sheff&gt;Sheffield (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mystery Train'', according to one reviewer, reflects on what could be called "the historical turn" that rock took at the close of the [[1960s in music|60s]], initiated by [[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Band]], and followed through by everyone from [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] to [[Randy Newman]], the music moving "beyond rock'n'roll's teenage immersion in the present to an adult sophistication steeped in deep knowledge of rock's roots in blues and country and lyrics that likewise looked to the past for inspiration."&lt;ref name=rey&gt;Reynolds (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another reviewer, Marcus proceeds in his examination of American popular culture with the "democratic assumption" that Presley and [[Herman Melville]] are already cultural and political equals, and are, therefore, "in conversation with one another - having a dialogue about freedom and limits, innovation and tradition, American dreams and American obsessions."&lt;ref name=cant&gt;Cantwell (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; When the 2nd edition came out, Elvis had recently died, and Marcus was asked to amend the chapter relating to Elvis by putting everything in the [[past tense]] but he refused, because, he said, "Elvis' presence was so powerful, I felt he's always in the [[present tense]]."&lt;ref name=&gt;Sheffield (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mystery Train'' opens with an episode on the ''[[Dick Cavett show]]'', where [[Little Richard]] interrupts a disagreement between a writer and a critic, and closes with a [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcript]] of [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] arguing with producer [[Sam Phillips]] as they are setting up to record "[[Great Balls of Fire]]" in 1957.&lt;ref name=gre&gt;Marcus (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Critical reception==
[[Frank Rich]] reviewed the book for ''[[The Village Voice]]'' and wrote that Marcus' "frame of reference is so vast that he never runs out of connections worth making between the music he loves and just about anything else that matters in American art and life.‚Äù&lt;ref name=garner/&gt; [[David Itzkoff]] and [[Alan Light]], in a 2005 critical roundup of music-related books, claimed that ''Myster Train'' is "perhaps the finest book ever written about pop music."&lt;ref name=itz&gt;Itzkoff, Light (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New York Times]]'' literary critic [[Dwight Garner (critic)|Dwight Garner]] stated in 2015 that "most critics and serious listeners think [''Mystery Train'']‚Äôs almost certainly the best book yet written about American music in general, and about rock in particular."&lt;ref name=garner&gt;Garner (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine picked it among the "100 best and most influential [books] written in English since 1923."&lt;ref name=time&gt;''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NSA warrantless surveillance''' (also commonly referred to as "'''warrantless-wiretapping'''" or "'''-wiretaps'''") refers to the [[surveillance]] of persons within the United States, including United States citizens, during the collection of notionally [[foreign intelligence]] by the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) as part of the [[Terrorist Surveillance Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/23/politics/23cnd-wiretap.html |work=The New York Times |title=White House Begins New Effort to Defend Surveillance Program |first1=David E. |last1=Sanger |first2=John |last2=O'Neil |date=January 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA was authorized to monitor, without obtaining a [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA warrant]], the [[telephone call|phone calls]], Internet activity, text messages and other communication involving any party believed by the NSA to be outside the U.S., even if the other end of the communication lay within the U.S.

Critics claimed that the program was an effort to silence critics of the Administration and its handling of several controversial issues. Under public pressure, the Administration allegedly ended the program in January 2007 and resumed seeking warrants from the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] (FISC).&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/politics/20060117gonzales_Letter.pdf|title=Gonzales_Letter |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008|FISA Amendments Act of 2008]], which relaxed some of the original FISC requirements.

During the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Barack Obama Administration]], the NSA allegedly continued surveilling without warrants despite campaign promises to end the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/us/01nsa.html |first1=Charlie |last1=Savage |first2=James |last2=Risen |date=March 31, 2010 |work=The New York Times |title=Federal Judge Finds N.S.A. Wiretaps Were Illegal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009 officials at the [[United States Department of Justice]] acknowledged that the NSA had engaged in "overcollection" of domestic communications in excess of the FISC's authority, but claimed that the acts were unintentional and had since been rectified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/us/16nsa.html |title=Officials Say U.S. Wiretaps Exceeded Law |author=[[Eric Lichtblau]] and [[James Risen]] |work=The New York Times |date=April 15, 2009 |accessdate=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
A week after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11 attacks]], Congress passed the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]] (AUMF), which inaugurated the "[[War on Terror]]". It later featured heavily in arguments over the NSA program.

Soon after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11 attacks]] President Bush established the [[President's Surveillance Program]]. As part of the program, the [[Terrorist Surveillance Program]] was established pursuant to an [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] that authorized the NSA to surveil certain telephone calls without obtaining a warrant (see {{UnitedStatesCode|50|1802}} {{UnitedStatesCode|50|1809}}). The complete details of the executive order are not public, but according to administration statements,&lt;ref name="Justice.gov-AttyGeneral"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Prepared Statement of Hon. Alberto R. Gonzales, Attorney General of the United States|date=February 6, 2006|publisher=US Department of Justice|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/archive/ag/speeches/2006/ag_speech_060206.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authorization covers communication originating overseas from or to a person suspected of having links to terrorist organizations or their affiliates even when the other party to the call is within the US.

In October 2001, Congress passed the [[Patriot Act]], which granted the administration broad powers to fight terrorism. The Bush administration used these powers to bypass the FISC and directed the NSA to spy directly on [[al-Qaeda]] via a new [[NSA electronic surveillance program]]. Reports at the time indicate that an "apparently accidental" "glitch" resulted in the interception of communications that were between two U.S. parties.&lt;ref name="nytimes051221"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/21/politics/21nsa.html|title=Spying Program Snared U.S. Calls|work=The New York Times|author1=James Risen  |author2=Eric Lichtblau |lastauthoramp=yes |date=December 21, 2005|accessdate=May 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act was challenged by multiple groups, including [[United States Congress|Congress]], as unconstitutional.

The precise scope of the program remains secret, but the NSA was provided total, unsupervised access to all fiber-optic communications between the nation's largest telecommunication companies' major interconnected locations, encompassing phone conversations, email, Internet activity, text messages and corporate private network traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AT&amp;T‚Äôs Role in Dragnet Surveillance of Millions of Its Customers |work=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] |url=https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/att/presskit/ATT_onepager.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FISA makes it illegal to intentionally engage in [[Surveillance|electronic surveillance]] as an official act or to disclose or use information obtained by such surveillance under as an official act, knowing that it was not authorized by statute; this is punishable with a fine of up to $10,000, up to five years in prison or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1809 |title=US CODE: Title 50, section 1809.

CRS released a report on the NSA program, "Presidential Authority to Conduct Warrantless Electronic Surveillance to Gather Foreign Intelligence Information", on January 5, 2006 that concluded:

{{quote|While courts have generally accepted that the President has the power to conduct domestic electronic surveillance within the United States inside the constraints of the Fourth Amendment, no court has held squarely that the Constitution disables the Congress from endeavoring to set limits on that power.

=== Legal action ===
While not directly ruling on the legality of domestic surveillance, the Supreme Court can be seen as having come down on both sides of the Constitution/statute question, in somewhat analogous circumstances.

In ''[[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]]'' (2004) the government claimed that AUMF authorized the detention of U.S. citizens designated as an [[enemy combatant]] despite its lack of specific language to that effect and notwithstanding the provisions of {{UnitedStatesCode|source=f|18|4001}}(a) that forbids the government to detain an American citizen except by act of Congress. In that case, the Court ruled:

{{quote|[B]ecause we conclude that the Government's second assertion ["that ¬ß&amp;nbsp;4001(a) is satisfied, because Hamdi is being detained "pursuant to an Act of Congress" [the AUMF]] is correct, we do not address the first. In other words, for the reasons that follow, we conclude that the AUMF is explicit congressional authorization for the detention of individuals ... and that the AUMF satisfied ¬ß&amp;nbsp;4001(a)'s requirement that a detention be "pursuant to an Act of Congress".}}

However, in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' the Court rejected the government's argument that AUMF implicitly authorized the President to establish [[Military justice|military commissions]] in violation of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]. The Court held:

{{quote|Neither of these congressional Acts, [AUMF or ATC] however, expands the President's authority to convene military commissions. First, while we assume that the AUMF activated the President's war powers, see ''Hamdi v. Rumsfeld'', {{Ussc|source=f|542|507|2004}}) (plurality opinion), and that those powers include the authority to convene military commissions in appropriate circumstances, see ''id.'', at 518; ''Quirin'', 317 U. S., at 28‚Äì29; see also ''Yamashita'', 327 U. S., at 11, there is nothing in the text or legislative history of the AUMF even hinting that Congress intended to expand or alter the authorization set forth in Article 21 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice|UCMJ]]. Cf. Yerger, 8 Wall., at 105 ("Repeals by implication are not favored")}}

In footnote 23, the Court rejected the notion that Congress is impotent to regulate the exercise of executive war powers:

{{quote|Whether or not the President has independent power, absent congressional authorization, to convene military commissions, he may not disregard limitations that Congress has, in proper exercise of its own war powers, placed on his powers. See ''Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer'', 343 U. S. 579, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). The Government does not argue otherwise.}}

Dozens of civil suits against the government and telecommunications companies over the program were consolidated before the chief judge of the Northern District of California, [[Vaughn R. Walker]]. One of the cases was a [[Class action|class-action]] lawsuit against [[AT&amp;T]], focusing on allegations that the company had provided the NSA with its customers' phone and Internet communications for a data-mining operation. Plaintiffs in a second case were the [[al-Haramain Foundation]] and two of its lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam|last=Liptak|title=U.S. Defends Surveillance to 3 Skeptical Judges |date=August 16, 2007 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/16/washington/16nsa.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bob|last=Egelko|title=Classified evidence debated: Court likely to allow suit against AT&amp;T, reject wiretap case |date=August 16, 2007 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/08/16/BAPCRJEFN.DTL&amp;type=printable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 17, 2006, Judge [[Anna Diggs Taylor]] of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan]] ruled in ''[[ACLU v. NSA]]'' that the [[Terrorist Surveillance Program]] was unconstitutional under the Fourth and First Amendments and enjoined the NSA from using the program to conduct electronic surveillance "in contravention of [FISA or Title III]".&lt;ref name="Wired.com-Judge-NSA" /&gt; She wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/eGov/taylorpdf/06%2010204.pdf Ruling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820121827/http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/eGov/taylorpdf/06%2010204.pdf|date=August 20, 2006}} The quote is from page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The President of the United States, a creature of the same Constitution which gave us these Amendments, has indisputably violated the Fourth in failing to procure judicial orders as required by FISA, and accordingly has violated the First Amendment Rights of these Plaintiffs as well.}}

In August 2007, a three-judge panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] heard arguments in two lawsuits challenging the program. On November 16, 2007, the three judges‚Äî[[M. Margaret McKeown]], [[Michael Daly Hawkins]] and [[Harry Pregerson]]‚Äîissued a 27-page ruling that the al-Haramain Foundation could not introduce a key piece of evidence because it fell under the government's claim of [[State Secrets Privilege|state secrets]], although the judges said that "In light of extensive government disclosures, the government is hard-pressed to sustain its claim that the very subject matter of the litigation is a state secret."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For Publication United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|date=November 16, 2007|publisher=United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|url=http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2007/11/15/0636083.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Eric|last=Lichtblau|title=Court Bars Secret Papers in Eavesdropping Case|date=November 17, 2007|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/17/washington/17nsa.html?pagewanted=print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a question-and-answer session published on August 22, [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[John Michael McConnell|Mike McConnell]] first confirmed that the private sector had helped the program.

=== Proposed FISA amendments ===
Several commentators raised the issue of whether FISA needed to be amended to address foreign intelligence needs, technology developments and advanced technical intelligence gathering. The intent was to provide programmatic approvals of surveillance of foreign terrorist communications, so that they could then legally be used as evidence for FISA warrants.

The Bush administration contended that amendment was unnecessary because they claimed that the President had inherent authority to approve the NSA program, and that the process of amending FISA might require disclosure of classified information that could harm national security.&lt;ref name="WHbrief121905" /&gt; In response, Senator Leahy said, "If you do not even attempt to persuade Congress to amend the law, you must abide by the law as written."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Statement of The Honorable Patrick Leahy|date=February 6, 2006|publisher=U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary|url=http://judiciary.senate.gov/member_statement.cfm?id=1727&amp;wit_id=2629}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Bush claimed that the law did not apply because the Constitution gave him "inherent authority" to act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/privacy/spying/23279res20051229.html|title=NSA Spying on Americans Is Illegal &amp;#124; American Civil Liberties Union|date=December 29, 2005|publisher=Aclu.org|accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/01/print/20060122.html|title=Democrats Continue to Attack Terrorist Surveillance Program|date=November 29, 2012|publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov|accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some politicians and commentators used "difficult, if not impossible" to argue that the administration believed Congress would have rejected an amendment. In his written "Responses to Questions from Senator Specter" in which Specter specifically asked why the administration had not sought to amend FISA,&lt;ref&gt;[http://childedlaw.org/publiclaw/pdf/gonzalesanswers.pdf "Responses to Questions from Senator Specter"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102113024/http://childedlaw.org/publiclaw/pdf/gonzalesanswers.pdf|date=November 2, 2006}}, February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Gonzales wrote:

{{quote|[W]e were advised by members of Congress that it would be difficult, if not impossible to pass such legislation without revealing the nature of the program and the nature of certain intelligence capabilities. That disclosure would likely have harmed our national security, and that was an unacceptable risk we were not prepared to take.}}

Competing legislative proposals to authorize the NSA program subject to Congressional or FISC oversight were the subject of Congressional hearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/congress/2006_hr/index.html#fisa4|title=FIS linking to 2006 FISA Congressional Hearings material|publisher=Fas.org|accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 16, 2006, Senators Mike DeWine, Lindsey Graham, Chuck Hagel and Olympia Snowe introduced the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 (S.2455),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/congress/2006_cr/dewine031606.html|title=Press Release of Senator DeWine|publisher=Fas.org|accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdt.org/security/20060324dewinebill.pdf|title=Dewine Bill as introduced|format=PDF|accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that gave the President limited statutory authority to conduct electronic surveillance of suspected terrorists in the US, subject to enhanced Congressional oversight.

On May 24, 2006, Specter and Feinstein introduced the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Improvement and Enhancement Act of 2006 (S.3001) denoting FISA as the exclusive means to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance.

On September 13, 2006, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to approve all three, mutually exclusive bills, thus, leaving it to the full Senate to resolve.&lt;ref name="FAS.org-20060914" /&gt;

On July 18, 2006, U.S. Representative Heather Wilson introduced the Electronic Surveillance Modernization Act (H.R. 5825). Wilson's bill would give the President the authority to authorize electronic surveillance of international phone calls and e-mail linked specifically to identified terrorist groups immediately following or in anticipation of an armed or terrorist attack. Surveillance beyond the initially authorized period would require a FISA warrant or a presidential certification to Congress. On September 28, 2006 the House of Representatives passed Wilson's bill and it was referred to the Senate.&lt;ref name="House.gov-FISA-20060929" /&gt;

Each of these bills would in some form broaden the statutory authorization for electronic surveillance, while still subjecting it to some restrictions. The Specter-Feinstein bill would extend the peacetime period for obtaining retroactive warrants to seven days and implement other changes to facilitate eavesdropping while maintaining FISC oversight. The DeWine bill, the Specter bill, and the Electronic Surveillance Modernization Act (already passed by the House) would all authorize some limited forms or periods of warrantless electronic surveillance subject to additional programmatic oversight by either the FISC (Specter bill) or Congress (DeWine and Wilson bills).

=== FISC order ===
On January 18, 2007, Gonzales told the Senate Judiciary Committee,

{{Quote|text=Court orders issued last week by a Judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court will enable the government to conduct electronic surveillance ‚Äì very specifically, surveillance into or out of the United States where there is probable cause to believe that one of the communicants is a member or agent of al Qaeda or an associated terrorist organization ‚Äì subject to the approval of the FISC.

The ruling by the FISC was the result of a two-year effort between the White House and the court to find a way to obtain court approval that also would "allow the necessary speed and agility" to find terrorists, Gonzales said in a letter to the top committee members. The court order on January 10 will do that, Gonzales wrote. Senior Justice department officials would not say whether the orders provided individual warrants for each wiretap or whether the court had given blanket legal approval for the entire NSA program. The ACLU said in a statement that "without more information about what the secret FISC has authorized, there is no way to determine whether the NSA's current activities are lawful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0701180074jan18,1,3952800.story?track=rss|title=Bush cedes authority on spy program|author=Siobhan Gorman|date=January 18, 2007|work=Chicago Tribune}}{{dead link|date=February 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law professor [[Chip Pitts]] argued that substantial legal questions remain regarding the core NSA program as well as the related data mining program (and the use of [[National Security Letter]]s), despite the government's apparently bringing the NSA program within the purview of FISA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chip Pitts|date=March 15, 2007|title=The End of Illegal Domestic Spying?

== Relevant constitutional, statutory and administrative provisions ==

=== U.S. Constitution ===

==== Article I and II ====
[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]] vests Congress with the sole authority "To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces" and "To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof." The Supreme Court has used the "necessary and proper" clause to affirm broad Congressional authority to legislate as it sees fit in the domestic arena,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} but has limited its application in foreign affairs. In the landmark ''[[United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.|US v. Curtiss-Wright]]'' (1936) decision, Justice [[George Sutherland]] for the Court:

{{quote|The ["powers of the federal government in respect of foreign or external affairs and those in respect of domestic or internal affairs"] are different, both in respect of their origin and their nature. The broad statement that the federal government can exercise no powers except those specifically enumerated in the Constitution, and such implied powers as are necessary and proper to carry into effect the enumerated powers, is categorically true only in respect of our internal affairs.}}

[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]] vests the President with power as "[[Commander-in-Chief|Commander in Chief]] of the Army and Navy of the United States," and requires that the President "shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed".

==== Fourth Amendment ====
The [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] is part of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and prohibits "unreasonable" searches and seizures by the government. A search warrant must be judicially sanctioned, based on [[probable cause]], supported by oath or affirmation (usually by a [[law enforcement officer]]), particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized, limited in scope (according to specific information supplied to the issuing court). It is solely a right of the people that neither the [[Executive (government)|Executive]] nor [[Legislature|Legislative branch]] can lawfully abrogate, even if acting in concert: no [[statute]] can make an unreasonable search reasonable.

The term "unreasonable" connotes the sense that a constitutional search has a rational basis, that it is not an excessive imposition upon the individual given the circumstances and is in accordance with societal norms. It relies on judges to be sufficiently independent of the authorities seeking warrants that they can render an impartial decision. Evidence obtained in an unconstitutional search is inadmissible in a criminal trial (with certain exceptions).

The Fourth Amendment explicitly allows reasonable searches, including searches without warrant in specific circumstances. Such circumstances include the persons, property and papers of individuals crossing the border of the United States and those of paroled felons; prison inmates, public schools and government offices; and of international mail. Although these are undertaken pursuant to a statute or an [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]], they derive their legitimacy from the Amendment, rather than these.

==== Ninth and Tenth Amendments ====
The [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] explicitly states that powers neither granted to the federal government nor prohibited to the states are reserved to the states or the people. The [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] states, "The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."

The Ninth Amendment bars denial of ununenumerated rights if the denial is based on the "enumeration of certain rights" in the Constitution, but does not bar denial of unenumerated rights if the denial is based on the "enumeration of certain powers" in the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=330&amp;page=75 ''United Public Workers v. Mitchell'', 330 U.S. 75 (1947)]. See also ''Jenkins v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue'', [http://openjurist.org/483/f3d/90/jenkins-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue 483 F.3d 90] (2d Cir 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Related Court opinions ====
The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has historically used Article II to justify wide deference to the President in foreign affairs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Two historical and recent cases define the secret wiretapping by the NSA. ''Curtiss-Wright'':

{{quote|It is important to bear in mind that we are here dealing not alone with an authority vested in the President by an exertion of legislative power, but with such an authority plus the very delicate, [[Plenary power|plenary]] and exclusive power of the President as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations‚Äìa power which does not require as a basis for its exercise an act of Congress, but which, of course, like every other governmental power, must be exercised in subordination to the applicable provisions of the Constitution.}}The extent of the President's power as [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]] has never been fully defined, but two Supreme Court cases are considered seminal in this area:&lt;ref&gt;"Any neutral assessment of the important separation of powers questions at issue here warranted a thorough consideration of Curtiss-Wright and the theory of presidential power it recognized (as well as the even more long-standing precedent on which the decision in Curtiss-Wright relied, including The Prize Cases, 67 U.S. (2 Black) 635" ‚Äì PROFESSOR JOHN C. EASTMAN in his solicited letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Steel Seizure Case12 is frequently cited as providing a framework for the courts to decide the extent of the President's authority, particularly in matters involving national security." CRS, ''"Presidential Authority to Conduct Warrantless Electronic Surveillance to Gather Foreign Intelligence Information"''&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. v. Sawyer]]'' (1952) and ''Curtiss-Wright''.

The Supreme Court held in ''[[Katz v. United States]]'' (1967), that the monitoring and recording of private conversations within the United States constitutes a "search" for [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] purposes, and therefore require a warrant.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held in ''[[Smith v Maryland]]'' (1979) that a judicial warrant is required for the government to acquire the content of electronic communications. However, [[subpoena]]s but not warrants are required for the business records ( ''metadata'') of their communications, data such as the numbers that an individual has phoned, when and, to a limited degree, where the phone conversation occurred.

The protection of "private conversations" has been held to apply only to conversations where the participants have manifested both a desire and a reasonable expectation that their conversation is indeed private and that no other party is privy to it. In the absence of such a reasonable expectation, the Fourth Amendment does not apply, and surveillance without warrant does not violate it. Privacy is clearly not a reasonable expectation in communications to persons in the many countries whose governments openly intercept electronic communications, and is of dubious reasonability in countries against which the United States is waging war.

Various [[United States circuit court|Circuit Court]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s upheld warrantless surveillance when the target was a [[foreign agent]] residing abroad,&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Duggan'', 743 F.2d 59, 72 (2d Cir. 1984) (citing cases)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fisa/092502sup.html|title=Justice Dept Supplemental Brief to the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Court of Review|publisher=Fas.org|accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a foreign agent residing in the US&lt;ref&gt;''[[Clay v.

''Boston College Law Review''. May 2006. Last access date January 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[United States v.

In 1985 the Supreme Court established the "border search exception", which permits warrantless searches at the US border "or its functional equivalent" in ''[[United States v. Montoya De Hernandez]]'', 473 U.S. 531, 538. The US can do so as a sovereign nation to protect its interests. Courts have explicitly included computer hard drives within the exception (''United States v. Ickes'', 393 F.3d 501 4th Cir. 2005), while ''United States v. Ramsey'', explicitly included all international postal mail.

The Supreme Court has not ruled on the constitutionality of warrantless searches targeting foreign powers or their agents within the US. Multiple [[Circuit Court]] rulings uphold the constitutionality of warrantless searches or the admissibility of evidence so obtained.&lt;ref&gt;Circuit courts applying ''Keith'' to the foreign intelligence context have affirmed the existence of a foreign intelligence exception to the warrant requirement for searches conducted within the United States which target foreign powers or their agents.

=== Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ===
{{Main|Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act}}
The 1978 [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)]] regulates government agencies' physical searches and electronic surveillance, in cases wherein a significant purpose is to gather foreign intelligence information. "Foreign intelligence information" is defined in {{UnitedStatesCode|50|1801}} as information necessary to protect the U.S. or its allies against actual or potential attack from a foreign power, [[sabotage]] or international terrorism. FISA defines a "foreign power" as a foreign government or any faction(s) of a foreign government not substantially composed of US persons, or any entity directed or controlled by a foreign government. FISA provides for both [[Criminal law|criminal]] and [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] liability for [[intent (law)|intentional]] electronic surveillance under [[color (law)|color of law]] except as authorized by statute.

FISA specifies two documents for the authorization of surveillance. First, FISA allows the Justice Department to obtain warrants from the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] (FISC) before or up to 72 hours after the beginning of the surveillance. FISA authorizes a FISC judge to issue a warrant if "there is [[probable cause]] to believe that‚Ä¶ the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power." 50 U.S.C. ¬ß&amp;nbsp;1805(a)(3). Second, FISA permits the President or his delegate to authorize warrantless surveillance for the collection of foreign intelligence if "there is no substantial likelihood that the surveillance will acquire the contents of any communication to which a United States person is a party". 50 U.S.C. ¬ß&amp;nbsp;1802(a)(1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cornell Law |work=50 U.S.C. ¬ß&amp;nbsp;1802(a)(1) |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1802-#a_1 |accessdate=January 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review]] (Court of Review) met for the first time and issued an opinion (''[[In re: Sealed Case No. 02-001]]''). They noted that all of the Federal courts of appeal had considered the issue and concluded that constitutional power allowed the president to conduct warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance. Furthermore, based on these rulings it "took for granted such power exists" and ruled that under this presumption, "FISA could not encroach on the president's constitutional power."

{{UnitedStatesCode|18|2511}}(2)(f) provides in part that FISA "shall be the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance, as defined in {{UnitedStatesCode|50|1801(f)}} ... and the intercept of domestic [communications] may be conducted". The statute includes a criminal sanctions subpart {{UnitedStatesCode|50|1809}} granting an exception, "unless authorized by statute".

=== Authorization for the Use of Military Force ===
The [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|Authorization for Use of Military Force]] was passed by Congress shortly after the 9/11 attacks. AUMF was used to justify the Patriot Act and related laws. It explicitly states in Section 2:

{{Quote|text=(a) IN GENERAL- That the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.|sign=|source=}}

=== USA PATRIOT Act ===
Section 215 of the PATRIOT act authorized the FBI to subpoena some or all business records from a business record holder using a warrant applied for in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

=== Terrorist surveillance program ===

The [[#Legality of warrantless surveillance|legality]] of surveillance involving US persons and extent of this authorization is the core of this controversy which includes:

Because of its highly classified status, little is officially known about the implementation of the TSP.

AT&amp;T]]'' court ''case''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/04/70619|work=Wired|title=Whistle-Blower Outs NSA Spy Room|author=Ryan Singel|date=April 7, 2006|accessdate=August 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/homefront/interviews/klein.html|work=Public Broadcasting System|title="Spying on the Home Front" ‚Äì Interview with Mark Klein|series=Frontline|date=January 9, 2007|accessdate=August 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein's January 16, 2004 statement included additional details regarding the construction of an NSA monitoring facility in [[Room 641A]] of 611 Folsom Street in San Francisco, the site of a large [[Southern Bell|SBC]] phone building, three floors of which were occupied by AT&amp;T.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/0517-10.htm |publisher=CommonDreams.org Newscenter |title=AT&amp;T Whistle-Blower's Evidence |date=May 17, 2006 |accessdate=August 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613191804/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/0517-10.htm |archivedate=June 13, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/homefront/etc/kleindoc.pdf|work=PBS Frontline|title=Klein's "2004 Package"|date=May 17, 2007|accessdate=August 15, 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Klein's affidavit, the NSA-equipped room used equipment built by [[Narus Corporation]] to intercept and analyze communications traffic, as well as to perform [[Data mining|data-mining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NarusInsight Intercept Suite|url=http://www.narus.com/products/intercept.html|accessdate=October 18, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018035437/http://www.narus.com/products/intercept.html |archivedate=October 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts from academia and the computing industry analyzed potential security risks posed by the NSA program, based on Klein's affidavits and those of expert witness J. Scott Marcus, a designer of large-scale IP-based data networks, former [[Chief technology officer|CTO]] at GTE Internetworking and at [[Genuity (Internet company)|Genuity]], and former senior advisor for Internet Technology at the [[Federal Communications Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DECLARATION OF J.

== Legal issues ==
While the dispute over the NSA program was waged on multiple fronts, the legal dispute pitted Bush and Obama administrations against opponents in Congress and elsewhere. Supporters claimed that the President's Constitutional duties as commander in chief allowed him to take all necessary steps in wartime to protect the nation and that AUMF activated those powers. Opponents countered by claiming that instead that existing statutes (predominantly FISA) circumscribed those powers, including during wartime.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost-NSAProgramQuestions2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/documents/NSAProgramQuestions.pdf|title=Legal memorandum of David S. Kris, former Deputy Attorney General for national security|date=January 25, 2006|work=The Washington Post|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formally, the question can be seen as a disagreement over whether Constitutional or statutory law should rule in this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/index.php/Constitutional_law |title=Cornell University ‚Äì Constitutional law |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the debate continued, other arguments were advanced.

=== Constitutional issues ===
The constitutional debate surrounding the program is principally about [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|separation of powers]]. If no "fair reading" of FISA can satisfy the [[Constitutional avoidance|canon of avoidance]], these issues must be decided at the appellate level. In such a separation of powers dispute, Congress bears burden of proof  to establish its supremacy: the Executive branch enjoys the presumption of authority until an Appellate Court rules against it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==== Article I and II ====
Whether "proper exercise" of Congressional war powers includes authority to regulate the gathering of foreign intelligence is a historical point of contention between the Executive and Legislative branches. In other rulings {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} has been recognized as "fundamentally incident to the waging of war".&lt;ref name="findlaw-20060119"&gt;U.S. Department of Justice White Paper on NSA Legal Authorities [http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/nsa/dojnsa11906wp.pdf "Legal Authorities Supporting the Activities of the National Security Agency Described by the President" (pdf)] January 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FAS.org-m010506"&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=Congressional Research Service |date=January 5, 2006 |title=Presidential Authority to Conduct Warrantless Electronic Surveillance to Gather Foreign Intelligence Information |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/intel/m010506.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''"Presidential Authority to Conduct Warrantless Electronic Surveillance to Gather Foreign Intelligence Information"'',&lt;ref name="FAS.org-m010506" /&gt; published by The [[Congressional Research Service]] stated:

{{quote|A review of the history of intelligence collection and its regulation by Congress suggests that the two political branches have never quite achieved a meeting of the minds regarding their respective powers. Presidents have long contended that the ability to conduct surveillance for intelligence purposes is a purely executive function, and have tended to make broad assertions of authority while resisting efforts on the part of Congress or the courts to impose restrictions. Congress has asserted itself with respect to domestic surveillance, but has largely left matters involving overseas surveillance to executive self-regulation, subject to congressional oversight and willingness to provide funds.}}

The same report repeats the Congressional view that intelligence gathered within the U.S. and where "one party is a U.S. person" qualifies as domestic in nature and as such is within their purview to regulate, and further that Congress may "tailor the President's use of an inherent constitutional power":

{{quote|The passage of FISA and the inclusion of such exclusivity language reflects Congress's view of its authority to cabin the President's use of any inherent constitutional authority with respect to warrantless electronic surveillance to gather foreign intelligence.

The Senate Judiciary Committee articulated its view with respect to congressional power to tailor the
President's use of an inherent constitutional power:
* The basis for this legislation [FISA] is the understanding ‚Äì concurred in by the Attorney General ‚Äì that even if the President has an "inherent" constitutional power to authorize warrantless surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes, Congress has the power to regulate the exercise of this authority by legislating a reasonable warrant procedure governing foreign intelligence surveillance}}

==== Fourth Amendment ====
The Bush administration claimed that the administration viewed the unanimity of pre-FISA Circuit Court decisions as vindicating their argument that warrantless foreign-intelligence surveillance authority existed prior to and subsequent to FISA and that this derived its authority from the Executive's inherent Article II powers, which may not be encroached upon by statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fisa/doj032406.pdf|title=DOJ/Attorney General Gonzales' responses to the House Judiciary Committee's oversight questions regarding the NSA Terrorist Surveillance Program, March 24, 2006|format=PDF|accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== District Court findings ====
Even some legal experts who agreed with the outcome of ACLU v. NSA criticized the opinion's reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Liptak, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/19/washington/19ruling.html "Experts Fault Reasoning in Surveillance Decision"], ''New York Times'', August 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Glenn Greenwald argued that the perceived flaws in the opinion in fact reflect the Department of Justice's refusal to argue the legal merits of the program (they focused solely on standing and state secrets grounds).&lt;ref&gt;[http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com/2006/08/grading-law-professors-apologies-due.html "Grading the law professors; apologies due Judge Taylor"] by [[Glenn Greenwald]], August 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== FISA practicality ===
FISA grants FISC the exclusive power to authorize surveillance of US persons as part of foreign intelligence gathering and makes no separate provision for surveillance in wartime. The interpretation of FISA's exclusivity clause is central because both sides agree that the NSA program operated outside FISA. If FISA is the controlling authority, the program is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;That Congress sees this as domestic intelligence can be inferred from the CRS position paper,"Congress has asserted itself with respect to domestic surveillance, but has largely left matters involving overseas surveillance to executive self-regulation, subject to congressional oversight and willingness to provide funds."&lt;/ref&gt;

The "no constitutional issue" critique is that Congress has the authority to legislate in this area under Article I and the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]],&lt;ref&gt;See for example,[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18650 Cole, Epstein, Heynmann ''Open Letter to Congress'']&lt;blockquote&gt;Congress indisputably has authority to regulate electronic surveillance within the United States, as it has done in FISA. Where Congress has so regulated, the President can act in contravention of statute only if his authority is exclusive, that is, not subject to the check of statutory regulation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while the "constitutional conflict" critique&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost-NSAProgramQuestions"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/documents/NSAProgramQuestions.pdf|title=Legal memorandum of David S. Kris, former Deputy Attorney General for national security|date=January 25, 2006|work=The Washington Post|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that the delineation between Congressional and Executive authority in this area is unclear,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Congressional Research Service|CRS]] report itself notes "A review of the history of intelligence collection and its regulation by Congress suggests that the two political branches have never quite achieved a meeting of the minds regarding their respective powers."&lt;/ref&gt; but that FISA's exclusivity clause shows that Congress had established a role for itself in this arena.

The Bush administration argued both that the President had the necessary power based solely on the Constitution and that conforming to FISA was not practical given the circumstances. Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs, [[William Moschella]], wrote:

{{quote|As explained above, the President determined that it was necessary following September 11 to create an early warning detection system. FISA could not have provided the speed and agility required for the early warning detection system. In addition, any legislative change, other than the AUMF, that the President might have sought specifically to create such an early warning system would have been public and would have tipped off our enemies concerning our intelligence limitations and capabilities.|sign=|source=}}

FBI Special Agent [[Coleen Rowley]], in her capacity as legal counsel to the Minneapolis Field Office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apfn.org/APFN/WTC_whistleblower1.htm|title=Coleen Rowley's Memo to FBI Director Robert Mueller|publisher=Apfn.org|accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; recounted how FISA procedural hurdles had hampered the FBI's investigation of [[Zacarias Moussaoui]] (the so-called "20th hijacker") prior to the [[9/11 attacks]]. Among the factors she cited were the complexity of the application, the amount of detailed information required, confusion by field operatives about the standard of probable cause required by the FISC and the strength of the required link to a foreign power. At his appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee in June 2002, FBI Director [[Robert Mueller]] responded to questions about the Rowley allegations, testifying that unlike normal criminal procedures, FISA warrant applications are "complex and detailed", requiring the intervention of FBI Headquarters (FBIHQ) personnel trained in a specialized procedure (the "Woods" procedure) to ensure accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fisa/fbi082903.pdf|title=FBI Director Mueller Explains the Significance of the Woods Procedures|format=PDF|accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court made no ruling on this question. However, on June 29, 2006, in ''Hamdan'', the Supreme Court rejected an analogous argument. Writing for the majority, Justice [[John Paul Stevens]], while ruling that "the AUMF activated the President's war powers, and that those powers include the authority to convene military commissions in appropriate circumstances" (citations omitted), held that nothing in the AUMF language expanded or altered the Uniform Code of Military Justice (which governs military commissions.) Stevens distinguished ''Hamdan'' from ''Hamdi'' (in which AUMF language was found to override the explicit language regarding detention in 18 U.S.C. ¬ß&amp;nbsp;4001(a)) in that ''Hamdan'' would require a "Repeal by implication" of the UCMJ.

=== Authorizing statute ===
The Bush administration held that AUMF enables warrantless surveillance because it is an authorizing statute.

An Obama Department of Justice whitepaper interpreted FISA's "except as authorized by statute" clause to mean that Congress allowed for future legislative statute(s) to provide exceptions to the FISA warrant requirements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=DOJ fact sheet:The NSA Program to Detect and Prevent Terrorist Attacks ‚Äì Myth vs Reality|date=January 27, 2006|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/readingroom/surveillance16.pdf|accessdate=2014-03-18|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the AUMF was such a statute. They further claimed that AUMF implicitly provided executive authority to authorize warrantless surveillance.

This argument is based on AUMF language, specifically, the acknowledgment of the President's Constitutional authority contained in the preamble:

{{Quote|text=Whereas, the President has authority under the Constitution to take action to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the United States...|sign=|source=}}

and the language in the resolution;

{{quote|[Be it resolved] [t]hat the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.}}

The Obama administration further claimed that Title II of the USA PATRIOT Act entitled ''[[USA PATRIOT Act, Title II|Enhanced Surveillance Procedures]]'' also allowed the program,{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} Obama stated that Americans' civil liberties were protected and that purely domestic wiretapping was conducted only pursuant to warrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2004/04/print/20040420-2.html|title=Remarks by the President in a Conversation on the USA Patriot Act|publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov|accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because FISA authorizes the President to bypass the FISC only during the first 15 days of a war declared by Congress, the argument claimed the AUMF implicitly gave the President the necessary power (as would any Congressional declaration of war). However, as a declaration of war encompasses all military actions so declared, including any otherwise constrained by Congress, the administration held that FISA set a presumptive minimum, which might be extended (explicitly or implicitly) by a declaration.

=== Corporate confidentiality analysis ===
Corporate secrecy is also an issue. In a letter to the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]], AT&amp;T objected to the filing of the documents in any manner, saying that they contain sensitive trade secrets and could be "used to 'hack' into the AT&amp;T network, compromising its integrity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/04/70619 |work=Wired |title=Whistle-Blower Outs NSA Spy Room |date=April 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430142924/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/04/70619 |archivedate=April 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chief Judge Walker stated, during the September 12, 2008 hearing in the EFF class-action lawsuit, that the Klein evidence could be presented in court, effectively ruling that AT&amp;T's trade secret and security claims were unfounded.

=== Duty to notify Congress ===
The Bush administration contended that with regard to the NSA program, it had fulfilled its notification obligations by briefing key members of Congress (thirteen individuals between the [[107th United States Congress|107th]] and [[109th United States Congress|109th Congressional]] sessions) more than a dozen times,{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} but they were forbidden from sharing that information with other members or staff.{{citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The CRS report asserted that the specific statutory notification procedure for covert action did not apply to the NSA program. It is not clear whether a restricted notification procedure intended to protect sources and methods was expressly prohibited. Additionally, the sources and methods exception requires a factual determination as to whether it should apply to disclosure of the program itself or only to specific aspects.

[[Peter J. Wallison]], former [[White House Counsel]] to President [[Ronald Reagan]] stated, "It is true, of course, that a president's failure to report to Congress when he is required to do so by law is a serious matter, but in reality the reporting requirement was a technicality that a President could not be expected to know about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ronald Reagan: The Power of Conviction and the Success of His Presidency|last=Wallison|first=Peter J.|publisher=Westview Press|year=2003|page=190|isbn=0-8133-4046-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== War Powers Resolution ===
The majority of legal arguments supporting the program were based on the [[War Powers Resolution]]. The War Powers Resolution has been questioned since its creation, and its application to the NSA program was questioned.

==== US citizens ====
No [[Declaration of war by the United States#Declarations of war|declaration of war]] explicitly applied to US citizens. Under the War Powers Resolution the only option to include them was to enact an encompassing authorization of the use of military force. The AUMF did not explicitly do so. Under AUMF, "nations, organizations or persons" must be identified as having planned, authorized, committed, aided or harbored the (9/11) attackers. Military force is thereby limited to those parties. Since [[September 11 attacks#Attackers and their background|no US citizens were alleged to be involved in the 9/11 attacks]], and since AUMF strictly states that [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|war-time enemies are those who were involved in 9/11]], including US citizens in general exceeds these provisions.

Opinions that actions stemming from the Patriot Act are constitutional follow from the AUMF. Since AUMF wartime powers do not explicitly apply to US citizens in general, they are exempted from its provision as a function of Ninth Amendment unenumerated rights. Thus Patriot Act provisions that are unconstitutionally (violating first, fourth and other amendments) applied to US citizens, are not rescued by the AUMF.

=== Other arguments ===
[[Philip Heymann]] claimed Bush had misstated the ''[[In re: Sealed Case No. 02-001]]'' ruling that supported Congressional regulation of surveillance. Heymann said, "The bottom line is, I know of no electronic surveillance for intelligence purposes since the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] was passed that was not done under the ... statute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Charlie |last=Savage |title=Specialists doubt legality of wiretaps |date=February 2, 2006 |work=Boston Globe |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/02/02/specialists_doubt_legality_of_wiretaps/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law professor [[John C. Eastman]] compared the [[Congressional Research Service|CRS]] and [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] reports and concluded instead that under the Constitution and ratified by both historical and Supreme Court precedent, "the President clearly has the authority to conduct surveillance of enemy communications in time of war and of the communications to and from those he reasonably believes are affiliated with our enemies. Moreover, it should go without saying that such activities are a fundamental incident of war."&lt;ref name="House.gov-NSAeastman"&gt;{{cite press release|title=NSA Eastman Letter|date=January 27, 2006|publisher=House Judiciary Committee|url=http://judiciary.house.gov/media/pdfs/nsaeastmanltr.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060224214356/http://judiciary.house.gov/media/pdfs/nsaeastmanltr.pdf|archivedate=February 24, 2006|format=PDF|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law professor [[Orin Kerr]] argued that the part of ''In re: Sealed Case No. 02-001'' that dealt with FISA (rather than the Fourth Amendment) was nonbinding [[Obiter dictum|''obiter dicta'']] and that the argument did not restrict Congress's power to regulate the executive in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volokh.com/posts/1135893533.shtml|title=The Volokh Conspiracy Blog|work=The NSA Surveillance Program and the Article II Argument|accessdate=December 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separately Kerr argued for wireless surveillance based on the fact that the [[border search exception]] permits searches at the border "or its functional equivalent." (''[[United States v. Montoya De Hernandez]]'', 473 U.S. 531, 538 (1985)). As a sovereign nation the US can inspect goods crossing the border. The ruling interpreted the Fourth Amendment to permit such searches. Courts have applied the border search exception to computers and hard drives, e.g., ''United States v. Ickes'', 393 F.3d 501 (4th Cir. 2005) Case law does not treat data differently than physical objects. Case law applies the exception to international airports and international mail (''United States v. Ramsey''). Case law is phrased broadly. The exception could analogously apply to monitoring an ISP or telephony provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.gwu.edu/faculty/profile.asp?ID=3568|title=George Washington Law School Profile|website=gwu.edu|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405231606/http://www.law.gwu.edu/faculty/profile.asp?ID=3568|archivedate=April 5, 2005|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.gwu.edu/Bibliography/showbibPRINT.asp?uid=3568|title=Orin Kerr Bibliography at GWU|website=gwu.edu|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213011233/http://www.law.gwu.edu/Bibliography/showbibPRINT.asp?uid=3568|archivedate=February 13, 2007|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classified information ===

==== Leaks ====
No single law criminalizes the leaking of classified information. Statutes prohibit leaking certain types of classified information under certain circumstances. One such law is {{uscsub|18|798}}; it was tacked on to the [[Espionage Act of 1917]]. It is known as the 'SIGINT' statute, meaning signals intelligence. This statute says:

{{quote|... whoever knowingly and willfully communicates, furnishes, transmits, or otherwise makes available to an unauthorized person, [including by publication,] [[Classified information in the United States|classified information]] [relating to] the communication intelligence activities of the United States or any foreign government, [shall be fined or imprisoned for up to ten years.]}}

This statute is not limited in application to only federal government employees. However, the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] suggests the statute may apply primarily to the "[c]ommunication of classified information by Government officer or employee". 50 USCS ¬ß&amp;nbsp;783 (2005).

A statutory procedure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=105_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ272.105|date=October 20, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows a "[[whistleblower]]" in the intelligence community to report concerns with the propriety of a secret program. The [[Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act]] of 1998, Pub. L. 105‚Äì272, Title VII, 112 Stat. 2413 (1998) essentially provides for disclosure to the agency Inspector General, and if the result of that is unsatisfactory, appeal to the Congressional Intelligence Committees. Former [[NSA]] official[[Russ Tice]] asked to testify under the terms of the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, in order to provide information to these committees about "highly classified Special Access Programs, or SAPs, that were improperly carried out by both the [[NSA]] and the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Washington |first=The |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20060104-114052-6606r.htm |title=NSA whistleblower asks to testify  |work=The Washington Times |date=January 4, 2006 |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Executive Order 13292]], which sets up the U.S. security classification system, provides (Sec 1.7) that "[i]n no case shall information be classified in order to conceal violations of law".

Given doubts about the legality of the overall program, the classification of its existence may not have been valid under E.O. 13292.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==== Publication of classified information ====
It is unlikely that a media outlet could be held liable for publishing classified information under established Supreme Court precedent. In ''[[Bartnicki v. Vopper]]'', 532 U.S. 514,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=532&amp;page=514 |title=FindLaw &amp;#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment precluded liability for a media defendant for publication of illegally obtained communications that the media defendant itself did nothing illegal to obtain, if the topic involves a public controversy. Due to the suit's procedural position, the Court accepted that intercepting information that was ultimately broadcast by the defendant was initially illegal (in violation of ECPA), but nonetheless gave the radio station a pass because it did nothing itself illegal to obtain the information.

Nor could the government have prevented the publication of the classified information by obtaining an injunction. In the [[Pentagon Papers]] case, (''[[New York Times Co. v. U.S.]]'', {{ussc|403|713|1971}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=403&amp;page=713 |title=FindLaw &amp;#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held that injunctions against the publication of classified information (''United States-Vietnam Relations, 1945‚Äì1967: A Study Prepared by The Department of Defense'' ‚Äì a 47-volume, 7,000-page, top-secret [[United States Department of Defense]] history of the United States' involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]) were unconstitutional [[prior restraint]]s and that the government had not met the heavy [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] required for prior restraint.

The ''1917 Espionage Act'', aside from the [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]] provision discussed above, only criminalizes 'national defense' information, not 'classified' information. Although the Justice Department as a matter of law sees no exemption for the press, as a matter of fact it has refrained from prosecuting:

{{quote|A prosecution under the espionage laws of an actual member of the press for publishing classified information leaked to it by a government source would raise legitimate and serious issues and would not be undertaken lightly, indeed, the fact that there has never been such a prosecution speaks for itself.}}

On the other hand, Sean McGahan of Northeastern University stated,

{{quote|There's a tone of gleeful relish in the way they talk about dragging reporters before grand juries, their appetite for withholding information, and the hints that reporters who look too hard into the public's business risk being branded traitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Eggen |pages=A01 |title=White House Trains Efforts on Media Leaks ‚Äì Sources, Reporters Could Be Prosecuted |date=March 5, 2006 |work=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/04/AR2006030400867.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Responses and analyses ==

=== Administration response to press coverage ===
On December 17, 2005, President Bush addressed the growing controversy in his weekly radio broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Presidential Radio Address ‚Äì 17 December 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that he was using his authority as President, as Commander in Chief and such authority as the Congress had given him, to intercept international communications of "people with known links to al Qaeda and related terrorist organizations". He added that before intercepting any communications, "the government must have information that establishes a clear link to these terrorist networks." He speculated that had the right communications been intercepted, perhaps the [[9/11]] attacks could have been prevented. He said the NSA program was re-authorized every 45 days, having at that time been reauthorized "more than 30 times"; it was reviewed by DOJ and NSA lawyers "including NSA's general counsel and inspector general", and Congress leaders had been briefed "more than a dozen times".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/12/print/20051217.html |title=President's December 17, 2005 Radio Address |publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech in Buffalo, New York on April 20, 2004, he said that:

{{quote|Secondly, there are such things as roving wiretaps. Now, by the way, any time you hear the United States government talking about wiretap, it requires ‚Äì a wiretap requires a court order. Nothing has changed, by the way. When we're talking about chasing down terrorists, we're talking about getting a court order before we do so.

And again, during a speech at Kansas State University on January 23, 2006, President Bush mentioned the program, and added that it was "what I would call a terrorist surveillance program", intended to "best ... use information to protect the American people",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=The White House |date=January 23, 2006 |title=President Discusses Global War on Terror at Kansas State University |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/01/print/20060123-4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that:

{{quote|What I'm talking about is the intercept of certain communications emanating between somebody inside the United States and outside the United States; and one of the numbers would be reasonably suspected to be an al Qaeda link or affiliate.

He stated:

{{quote|[B]ecause you frequently hear this called a 'domestic surveillance program.' It is not.

In a press conference on December 19 held by both Attorney General Gonzales and General [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]], the Principal Deputy Director for National Intelligence, General Hayden claimed, "This program has been successful in detecting and preventing attacks inside the United States." He stated that even an emergency authorization under FISA required marshaling arguments and "looping paperwork around". Hayden implied that decisions on whom to intercept under the wiretapping program were being made on the spot by a shift supervisor and another person, but refused to discuss details of the specific requirements for speed.&lt;ref name="WHbrief121905" /&gt;

DOJ sent a 42-page [[white paper]] to Congress on January 19, 2006 stating the grounds upon which it was felt the NSA program was legal, which restated and elaborated on reasoning Gonzales used at the December press conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=hotlineblog |work=US Department of Justice White Paper on NSA Legal Authorities |url=http://hotlineblog.nationaljournal.com/archives/White%20Paper%20on%20NSA%20Legal%20Authorities.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218054524/http://hotlineblog.nationaljournal.com/archives/White%20Paper%20on%20NSA%20Legal%20Authorities.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 18, 2006 |accessdate=January 19, 2006|format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gonzales spoke again on January 24, claiming that Congress had given the President the authority to order surveillance without going through the courts, and that normal procedures to order surveillance were too slow and cumbersome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/archive/ag/speeches/2006/ag_speech_0601241.html Attorney General Alberto Gonzales' speech at Georgetown University] January 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

General Hayden stressed the NSA's respect for the Fourth Amendment, stating at the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]] on January 23, 2006, "Had this program been in effect prior to 9/11, it is my professional judgment that we would have detected some of the 9/11 al Qaeda operatives in the United States, and we would have identified them as such."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/news/2006/intell-060123-dni01.htm |title=General Hayden's address to the National Press Club on January 23, 2006 |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=January 23, 2006 |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech on January 25, 2006, President Bush said, "I have the authority, both from the Constitution and the Congress, to undertake this vital program,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=The White House |date=January 25, 2006 |title=President Visits National Security Agency |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/01/print/20060125-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; telling the House [[Republican Caucus]] at their February 10 conference in Maryland that "I wake up every morning thinking about a future attack, and therefore, a lot of my thinking, and a lot of the decisions I make are based upon the attack that hurt us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jennifer |last=Loven |title=Update 19: Bush Reveals Rationale Behind Surveillance |date=February 10, 2006 |work=Forbes |url=https://www.forbes.com/technology/ebusiness/feeds/ap/2006/02/10/ap2517004.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Bush reacted to a May 10 domestic call records article by restating his position, that it is "not mining or trolling through the personal lives of millions of innocent Americans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bush says U.S. not 'trolling through personal lives' |publisher=CNN |date=May 11, 2006 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/05/11/nsa.phonerecords/index.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615052647/http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/05/11/nsa.phonerecords/index.html |archivedate=June 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Congressional response ===
Three days after news broke about the NSA program, a bipartisan group of Senators‚ÄîDemocrats [[Dianne Feinstein]], [[Carl Levin]], [[Ron Wyden]] and Republicans [[Chuck Hagel]] and [[Olympia Snowe]], wrote to the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary]] and [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence Committee]] chairs and ranking members requesting the two committees to "seek to answer the factual and legal questions" about the program.

On January 20, 2006, in response to the administration's asserted claim to base the NSA program in part on the AUMF, Senators Leahy and Kennedy introduced Senate Resolution 350 that purported to express a "sense of the Senate" that the AUMF "does not authorize warrantless domestic surveillance of United States citizens".&lt;ref name="Senate.gov-Authorization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Senate.gov-Leahy" /&gt; It was not reported out of committee.&lt;ref name="Leahy350isdead" /&gt;

In introducing their resolution to committee,&lt;ref&gt;The following statements are taken from the Library of Congress records, pages S137 ‚Äì S139. Online versions: [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2006_record&amp;page=S137&amp;position=all p.137], [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2006_record&amp;page=S138&amp;position=all p.138], [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2006_record&amp;page=S139&amp;position=all p.139] (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; they quoted Supreme Court Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]'s opinion that even war "is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens".

Additionally, they asserted that the DOJ legal justification was a "manipulation of the law" similar to other "overreaching" and "twisted interpretations" in recent times. Leahy and Kennedy also asserted that Gonzales had "admitted" at a press conference on December 19, 2005, that the Administration did not seek to amend FISA to authorize the NSA spying program because it was advised that "it was not something we could likely get." (However, as noted below under "Proposed Amendments to FISA", Gonzales made clear that what he actually said was that such an amendment was "not something [they] could likely get" without disclosing the nature of the program and operational limitations and that it was believed that such disclosure would be damaging to national security.)

Leahy and Kennedy asserted that the procedures adopted for the NSA program, specifically the 45-day reapproval cycle was "not good enough" because the review group were executive branch appointees. Finally, they concluded that Congressional and Judicial oversight were fundamental and should not be unilaterally discarded.

In February 2008, the Bush administration backed a new version of FISA that would grant telecom companies retroactive immunity from lawsuits stemming from surveillance. On March 14, the House passed a bill that did not grant such immunity.

=== Anonymity networks ===
[[Edward Snowden]] copied and leaked thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists. The information revealed the access of some federal agencies to the public's online identity and led to wider use anonymizing technologies. In late 2013, soon after Snowden‚Äôs leaks, it was loosely calculated that encrypted browsing software, such as [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]], [[I2P]] and [[Freenet]] had ‚Äúcombined to more than double in size‚Ä¶ and approximately 1,050,000 total machines ‚Äòlegitimately‚Äô use the networks on a daily basis, amounting to an anonymous population that is about 0.011 percent of all machines currently connected to the Internet.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Neill|first1=Patrick|title=Tor and the rise of anonymity networks|url=http://www.dailydot.com/technology/tor-freenet-i2p-anonymous-network/|website=The Daily Dot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that these tools are designed to protect the identity and privacy of their users, an exact calculation of the growth of the anonymous population cannot be accurately rendered, but all estimates predict rapid growth.

These networks were accused of supporting illegal activity. They can be used for the illicit trade of drugs, guns and pornography. However, Tor executive director [[Roger Dingledine]] claimed that the ‚Äúhidden services‚Äù represent only 2 percent of total traffic on Tor‚Äôs network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenberg|first1=Andy|title=Over 80 Percent of Dark-Web Visits Relate to Pedophilia, Study Finds|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/12/80-percent-dark-web-visits-relate-pedophilia-study-finds/|website=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact suggests that the large majority of those who use it do so in order to protect their normal browsing activity, an effort to protect their personal values of privacy rather than to participate in illegal activity.

=== Trade-off between security and liberty ===

Polls analyzed the trade-off between security and liberty. A June 2015 poll conducted by Gallup asked participants if the US should take all the necessary steps to prevent terrorist attacks even if civil liberties are violated. 30% of respondents agreed: 65% instead said take steps, but do not violate civil liberties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Jeffrey|title=Americans Still Say Liberties Should Trump Anti-Terrorism|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/183548/americans-say-liberties-trump-anti-terrorism.aspx|website=Gallup|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2004 Pew poll, 60% of respondents rejected the idea of sacrificing privacy and freedom in the name of security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gao|first1=George|title=What Americans think about NSA surveillance, national security and privacy|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/29/what-americans-think-about-nsa-surveillance-national-security-and-privacy/|website=Pew Research Center }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014 a similar Pew poll found that 74% of respondents preferred privacy, while 22% said the opposite. Pew noted that post 9/11 surveys revealed that in the periods during which prominent incidents that related to privacy and security first came up, the majority of respondents favored an ideology of ‚Äúsecurity first", while maintaining that a dramatic reduction in civil liberties should be avoided. Events often caused Americans to back allow government to investigate suspected terrorists more effectively, even if those steps might infringe on the privacy of ordinary citizens. The majority of respondents reject steps that translate into extreme intrusion into their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raine|first1=Lee|last2=Maniam|first2=Shiva|title=Americans feel the tensions between privacy and security concerns|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/19/americans-feel-the-tensions-between-privacy-and-security-concerns/|website=Pew Research }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various administrations claimed that reducing privacy protections reduces obstacles that anti-terrorism agencies face attempting to foil terrorist attacks and that fewer privacy protections makes it more difficult for terrorist groups to operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dragu|first1=Tiberiu|title=Is There a Trade-off between Security and Liberty?

An '''online book''' is a resource in [[book]]-like form that is only available to read on the [[Internet]]. It differs from the common idea of an [[e-book]], which is usually available for users to download and read locally on a computer, [[smartphone]] or on an [[e-reader]]. "Book-like" means: information is presented in a page format; pages are normally available to read sequentially (though "flipping" to another page is possible using a mouse, keyboard or other controllers); and pages are read passively, with little or no interaction or multimedia. This contrasts with a text which a user is reading on an interactive [[Web 2.0]] website, which usually enables the user to click on online links, look up words or keywords online, etc.   "Online" means the content may only be read while the reader is connected to the Internet. Thus the reader's experience with an online book is similar to reading a printed book, except that the book is read at a computer and is only accessible while the reader is online. 

Online books are a common resource in [[virtual learning environment]]s (VLEs). For example, the [[Moodle]] VLE defines an online book in this way. Over the last few years, there has been an increase of online books that are being used for notable events or to commemorate the memory of someone. The fundraising industry often uses online books as a way to fundraise, as online books are also a way to collect donations and engage with their audience.

The production and distribution of [[pornographic film]]s are both activities that are lawful in many, but by no means all, countries so long as the [[pornography]] features performers aged [[Age of majority|above a certain age]], usually eighteen years. Further restrictions are often placed on such material.

== Africa ==

=== Botswana ===
The possession of "Indecent and obscene material such as pornographic books, magazines, films, videos, DVDs and software" is prohibited in [[Botswana]]. Possession or import of such material is illegal and punishable by a fine or up to 4 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botswanatourism.co.bw/getting_in/entry_requirements.html Botswana Tourism Board], "Entry Requirements". botswanatourism.co.bw.

=== Egypt ===
In [[Egypt]], it is illegal to distribute pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egyptian MP sends porn to fellow parliamentarians over WhatsApp, blames 'hackers'|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/egyptian-mp-sends-porn-fellow-parliamentarians-over-whatsapp-blames-hackers-1567718|publisher=International Business Times|date=27 June 2016|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possession and import of pornography are offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Court in Egypt Declares Internet Pornography Illegal|publisher=ValueWalk|author=Paul Shea|date=28 March 2012|accessdate=16 July 2017|url=http://www.valuewalk.com/2012/03/a-court-in-egypt-declares-internet-pornography-illegal/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike numerous African nations which have no laws against child pornography, [[Internet in Egypt|Egypt blocks child pornography websites]] and dealing in child pornography carries a minimum sentence of five years and fines of US$29,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pornography and The Criminal Justice System|author=Carmen M.

=== Ethiopia ===
All forms of pornography is illegal in Ethiopia, its production in that country is rare. The legal status of Internet pornography in Ethiopia is uncertain.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Morocco ===
In 2004, Morocco introduced severe punishment for promoting pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Countries at the Crossroads: A Survey of Democratic Governance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ebjEVjJ-DcAC|first1=Sanja|last1=Tatic|first2=Christopher|last2=Walker|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2006|isbn=9780742558014|page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producing pornography of any kind is illegal in Morocco. However, it does not apply much on Internet pornography; porn websites are widely accessible in Morocco.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== Nigeria ===
Nigeria has no national laws prohibiting pornography, although the public display of graphic sexual material is illegal in Lagos. The country has a small indigenous pornography industry which produces exclusively heterosexual pornography as [[LGBT rights in Nigeria|homosexual activity in Nigeria is illegal]]. Some Muslim politicians in the national government have proposed a nationwide block on pornographic websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nigeria's Porn Industry Is Getting Ready To Overtake America's|url=http://www.konbini.com/ng/lifestyle/nigeria-is-home-to-the-newest-porn-economy/|website=Konbini|author=Odunayo Eweniyi|date=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is significant piracy of pornography in Nigeria, with pirated pornographic DVDs being sold from roadside stalls in [[Lagos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Criminology: The Core|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wzGSWLTPguAC|first=Larry J.|last=Siegel|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2010|isbn=9780495809838|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pornography is also sold in Nigerian [[sex shop]]s and some [[pornographic magazine]]s are produced in the country, often reproducing pictures from foreign magazines. The first officially acknowledged [[hardcore pornography|hardcore pornographic]] film produced in Nigeria was ''Better Lover Valentine Sex Party''. It was not submitted to the National Film and Video Censors Board for classification and it was immediately banned on the grounds of obscenity and immorality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Perspectives on Social Issues: Pornography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gCwR-WxI0x0C|first1=Richard|last1=Procida|first2=Rita James|last2=Simon|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2007|isbn=9780739120927|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet pornography is widely viewed in Nigeria. In 2015 the monthly average for the number of searches for pornography was 135,000, and in December 2014 and 2015 the proportion of searches for pornography (relative to other searches) was higher in Nigeria than in the United States. In 2013 Nigeria ranked second globally for Internet searches for [[gay pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nigeria, We‚Äôve Got A Sexuality Problem!|url=http://subomiplumptre.com/porn/|author=Subomi Plumptre|date=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
Pornography rated X18 is permitted by the law only if sold to persons over the age of 18 in registered stores. It is an offense to host a pornographic web site in South Africa because of the difficulty of age-verification and the requirement that pornography only be distributed from designated, licensed physical premises. It is also unlawful to visually represent bestiality (also rated XX), but not in text descriptions. Supplying violent pornography is an offence in any form, but the law allows the production of pornography that is not prohibited.

Distribution of pornography is regulated by the Films and Publications Act of 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Government Gazette|url=http://www.gov.za/sites/www.gov.za/files/Act65of1996.pdf|publisher=Republic of South Africa|date=8 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is enforced by the Films and Publications Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Classification Query Engine|publisher=Films and Publication Board|url=http://www.fpb.gov.za/home_page.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103025901/http://www.fpb.gov.za/home_page.asp |archive-date=3 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sudan ===
Pornography is prohibited in Sudan and the laws are strict. Pornographic websites are blocked by the government, pornography is largely inaccessible, and porn possession, production, distribution and sale can lead to fines, prison or [[corporal punishment]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

=== Uganda ===
Pornographic DVDs have in the past been sold on the streets in [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name=Fallon&gt;{{cite news|title=Confusion over Uganda's 'miniskirt ban' leads to public attacks on women|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/feb/28/uganda-miniskirt-ban-attacks-women|author=Amy Fallon|date=28 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an Anti-Pornography Act (popularly known as the "Anti-Miniskirt Law") was signed into law in 2014 with the stated objectives of defining what constitutes the offence of pornography and establishing a Pornography Control Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and Girls Rising: Progress and Resistance Around the World|editor1=Ellen Chesler|editor2=Terry McGovern|publisher=Routledge|date=2015|ISBN=9781317482666|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZJrwCQAAQBAJ|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee is responsible for the implementation of the law and for taking measures to detect, prohibit, collect and destroy pornographic materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Museveni Signs Anti-Pornography Bill into Law|url=http://www.redpepper.co.ug/museveni-signs-anti-pornography-bill-into-law/|magazine=Red Pepper|accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law broadly defines pornography as "any representation of the sexual parts of a person for primarily sexual excitement".&lt;ref name=Fallon/&gt; The law says that "a person shall not produce, traffic in, publish, broadcast, procure, import, export, sell or abet any form of pornography".

=== China ===
{{Main|Pornography in China}}
It is illegal to sell or distribute pornography in China, but it is not illegal to own or to watch it. Google, Yahoo, YouTube and other websites do not allow users in China to perform searches related to sex.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Pornographic material in China comes from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, or Japan.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==== Hong Kong ====
Hong Kong is the primary source of Chinese-language erotica.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Pornographic films in Hong Kong are referred to as [[List of Hong Kong Category III films|Category III films]], after the territory's motion picture rating system. Category III films would generally be considered softcore by American and Japanese standards, often featuring more elaborate and comical plots than foreign equivalents. In the early 21st century many of the roles involving sex scenes are actually performed by Japanese actresses, with any dialogue dubbed into Chinese, rather than by Chinese women.

Hardcore pornographic videos and films, in both physical and digital forms, can be legally sold in the territory.

=== India ===

The possession and viewing of pornography by an adult in a private residence is legal in India.

Possession of pornography became widespread among elites during the late 1990s. Political and army elites are the most active consumers of pornography. Locally produced pornography initially appeared during the reign of [[Kim Jong-il]]. A typical North Korean-made [[pornographic film]] involves nude or scantily clad women dancing with music.&lt;ref name="Moon2007"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Porno Became Widespread in '90s, Thanks to the Dear Leader | author = Moon Sung Hwee | work = Daily NK | date = 23 December 2007 | accessdate = 21 September 2016 | url = http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk01300&amp;num=3042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Pornography in Europe}}
European hardcore pornography is dominated by a few pan-European producers and distributors, the most notable of which is the [[Private Media Group]]. Most European countries also have local pornography producers, from Portugal (''Naturalvideo'') to Romania (''Floyd-Agency''), all of which compete with larger, international organizations with varying levels of success.

Many U.S.-based pornography websites distribute European pornography as a [[genre]]. These actresses (often advertised as "Eurobabes")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eurobabeindex.com | title=Eurobabeindex | accessdate=2006-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; may conform more to a look usually seen in U.S. actresses than European ones, although they may still be considered to look "more natural". European pornography typically de-emphasizes [[breast implant]]s, among other aesthetic factors.

=== Belarus ===
Production, dissemination and assembly of pornography is banned, with laws strictly enforced. Breaking the law is punishable with up to four years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sk.gov.by/ru/news-ru/view/razmeschenie-pornografii-v-sotsialnyx-setjax-vlechet-ugolovnuju-otvetstvennost-1323/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320024054/http://sk.gov.by/ru/news-ru/view/razmeschenie-pornografii-v-sotsialnyx-setjax-vlechet-ugolovnuju-otvetstvennost-1323/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 March 2016|title=–†–∞–∑–º–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–æ—Ä–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∏ –≤ —Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–µ—Ç—è—Ö –≤–ª–µ—á–µ—Ç —É–≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–Ω—É—é –æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å|author=|date=24 June 2016|work=sk.gov.by|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
In France, pornography is overall permitted, but with distinctions: 
* Hardcore pornography must not be sold to minors under the age of 18.
* Softcore porn is allowed for people 16 and over. 
* Extremely violent or graphic pornography is considered [[X rating|X-rated]], and so may be shown only in specific theaters, and may not be displayed to [[minor (law)|minors]].
* Some pornography has a special ([[value-added tax]]) VAT: a 33% tax is levied on X-rated movies, and a 50% excise is placed on pornographic online services.

The ratings system has caused controversy; e.g., in 2000 the sexually explicit and violent film ''[[Baise-moi]]'' was initially rated only as "restricted" by the French government. This classification was overturned by a ''[[Conseil d'√âtat (France)|Conseil d'√âtat]]'' ruling in a lawsuit brought by associations supporting [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[family values]].

Some movies are forbidden to minors under 18, without the X rating, like ''[[Baise-moi]]'', ''[[Ken Park]]'' or ''[[Saw III|Saw 3]]'', so that these movies can be viewed in theaters and not attract VAT.

=== Germany ===
The constitution and law are very strict about [[hardcore pornography]], especially when compared to very liberal laws about [[softcore pornography]], [[prostitution]] and [[sex shop]]s. Supplying hardcore pornography to people who are less than 18 years old is an offence, and shops selling it must keep people under the age of 18 from entering their premises. If only a part of the shop is dedicated to pornography, it must be completely closed off from the rest of the premises. Alternatively, shops may choose not to display their goods or advertise that they sell them, in which case minors may be admitted. Websites hosting pornographic material within Germany must comply with very strict rules about verifying that viewers are over 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/BGH-reicht-Check-der-Ausweisnummer-als-Zugangshuerde-fuer-Online-Pornos-nicht-aus--/meldung/97651|title=BGH reicht Check der Ausweisnummer als Zugangsh√ºrde f√ºr Online-Pornos nicht aus|first=Stefan|last=Krempl|date=19 October 2007|work=heise.de|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soft porn is less restricted, and may even be broadcast on TV at night. The age threshold is usually FSK-16. In contrast many uncut action films or video games easily reach the FSK-18 rating.

=== Hungary ===
{{Main|Pornography in Hungary}}
In Hungary, pornography is unlawful if sold or shown to children under 18 years of age. Displaying the genitals openly, as on the cover of a magazine, is not prohibited.

=== Iceland ===
The production or sale of pornography is prohibited in Iceland. Heavy fines were applied in 2001 and ten years earlier a fine was applied to the first manager of the first private TV-station (and the only case to present) in Iceland for showing the Danish "mainstream" [[Zodiac-films]], ''[[I Tvillingernes tegn]]'' and ''[[I Tyrens tegn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=2677| title=Hva√∞ er kl√°m? |accessdate=31 August 2015 |language=is}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2013 there was a draft proposal by [[√ñgmundur J√≥nasson]], the [[Minister of the Interior (Iceland)|Minister of the Interior]], to extend the ban to online pornography to protect children from violent sexual imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Associated Press | author-link = Associated Press | title = Iceland seeks internet pornography ban | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/25/iceland-seeks-internet-pornography-ban | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | date = 25 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan has been stalled since the change in government during the [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2013|parliamentary election on 27 April 2013]]. Since then, there have been no changes to the relevant legislation, and no changes have been formally proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Iceland: Key developments: June 2014-May 2015, limits on content | url = https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2015/iceland | website = freedomhouse.org | publisher = [[Freedom House]] | date = 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Helgad√≥ttir | first = √Åsta Gu√∞r√∫n | author-link = √Åsta Helgad√≥ttir | title = The Icelandic initiative for pornography censorship | journal = [[Porn Studies]] | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 285‚Äì298 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/23268743.2014.928462 | date = July 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23268743.2014.928462 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
{{Main|Pornography in Italy}}
In Italy, it is illegal to distribute pictorial or video pornography to persons under the age of 18. However, persons over 18 years of age are permitted to view pornographic material.

=== Russia ===
According to Russian law, consumption of pornography is allowed though the production of it is not. The illegal production, distribution, and "public demonstration" of pornography is punishable by a 2- to 6-year prison term. [[Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media|Roskomnadzor]], the Russian government's media overseer, has the power to order the blocking of pornographic websites. In 2015 the agency required the blocking of the Russian-language version of [[Pornhub]] and 10 other pornographic sites on the basis of a court ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia Blocks Access to Popular Porn Sites|url=http://www.tol.org/client/article/26316-russia-pornhub-roskomnadzor-blacklist-media.html|date=15 September 2016|work=Transitions Online|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is nevertheless some uncertainty concerning the legal status of pornography in Russia. The law criminalizes only the 'illegal' production and selling of pornography (which implies that it sometimes can be legal), but two circumstances make enforcement of the law difficult: (1) the lack of a legal definition of pornography, and (2) no law defining when production or selling is permitted.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

=== Ukraine ===
Pornographic production, distribution, broadcasting (both audio and video), transportation, import and advertisement is forbidden by law in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zakon4.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/1296-15|title=–ó–∞–∫–æ–Ω –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ "–ü—Ä–æ –∑–∞—Ö–∏—Å—Ç —Å—É—Å–ø—ñ–ª—å–Ω–æ—ó –º–æ—Ä–∞–ª—ñ"|date=5 March 2015|publisher=Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine|language=Ukrainian|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
{{main|Pornography in the United Kingdom}}
In [[England and Wales]], the main legislation on pornographic materials is the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959]], the [[Obscene Publications Act 1964]], and the [[Indecent Displays (Control) Act 1981]]. Video-oriented depictions of hardcore material (with certain exceptions for works considered primarily 'artistic' rather than pornographic) were banned until 1999, when the removal of trade barriers with other [[European Union]] member states allowed for the relatively free movement of such goods for personal use. [[R18 (British Board of Film Classification)|R18-rated]] videos are only available in licensed sex shops, but hardcore pornographic magazines are available in shops selling newspapers and magazines. In 2008, the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] unsuccessfully prosecuted a man under the Obscene Publications Act (the ''[[R v Walker]]'' trial) for a textual story on a pornography website involving [[Girls Aloud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/7649231.stm|title=Girls Aloud in 'murder' blog case|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-10-02|accessdate=2008-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, the [[Home Office]] introduced legislation to criminalize possession of what it has labelled [[Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008|extreme pornography]]; these laws are now contained in sections 63 to 68 of the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/ukpga_20080004_en_9#pt5-pb1-l1g63|title=Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008|author=|date=|website=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Pornography in Canada}}
The laws of Canada permit the sale of [[hardcore pornography]] to anyone over the age of eighteen. While persons below that age may have pornography in their possession, its sale to them is prohibited.

Most hardcore pornography is sold in [[Sex shop|adult stores]] or on [[Internet pornography|adult websites]].

=== Cuba ===
Pornography was illegal in Cuba during [[Fidel Castro]]'s leadership of the country, but the laws were relaxed in the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=119822|title=Pornography in Cuba, Enemy of the State|author=Frank Simon|date=7 July 2016|work=Havana Times|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many pornographic websites are still blocked in Cuba.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== United States ===
{{Main|Pornography in the United States}}
In the [[United States]], pornography is not unlawful at the federal level, but is subject to the [[Miller test|''Miller'' test]], which was developed in the 1973 case ''[[Miller v. California]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/printer_friendly.pl?page=us/413/15.html Text of the decision and dissents], from findlaw.com&lt;/ref&gt; The Miller test was an effort to differentiate between pornography and 'obscenity.' It has three parts:

* Whether "the average person, applying contemporary [[community standards]]", would find that the [[Work of art|work]], taken as a whole, appeals to the [[wiktionary:prurient|prurient]] interest,
* Whether the work depicts or describes, in a [[patently offensive]] way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law,
* Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious [[Literature|literary]], [[art]]istic, [[Politics|political]], or [[Science|scientific]] value.&lt;ref&gt;This is also known as the ''(S)LAPS test''‚Äî[Serious] Literary, Artistic, Political, Scientific.&lt;/ref&gt; The work is considered obscene only if ''all three'' conditions are satisfied. Local areas are permitted to develop their own laws on the issue, as long as they do not conflict with federal law.

Pornography is a large industry that involves major entertainment companies, which offer pornography films through cable channels and in-room movies in hotels. Pornography distribution changed radically during the 1980s, with [[VHS]] and [[cable television]] largely displacing X-rated theaters. VHS distribution, in turn, has been replaced by [[DVD]] and Internet distribution for [[niche market]]s. Pornography generates billions of dollars in sales in the United States alone. An estimated 211 new pornographic films are made every week in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,12271,947880,00.html With pot and porn outstripping corn, America's black economy is flying high], ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oceania ==
=== Australia ===
{{see also|Censorship in Australia|Pornography in Australia}}
In [[Australia]], possession of pornographic material is permitted. However, it is illegal to sell, exhibit or rent X-rated pornographic material in most [[States and territories of Australia|states of Australia]], including [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]], [[Western Australia]], [[New South Wales]], [[Tasmania]], and [[Queensland]]. In contrast, it is legal to sell, exhibit, or rent X-rated pornographic material in some [[States and territories of Australia|territories]] including the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. As the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian constitution]] prohibits states from regulating interstate commerce, the law permits the purchase of pornography from stores in either territory and also bringing it interstate. This means that the majority of Australian mail-order operations for adult material operate from the ACT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kathy Marks|title=Canberra reborn as capital of sex|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/canberra-reborn-as-capital-of-sex-5371392.html|newspaper=The Independent|location=London|date=29 April 2000|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the offenses under state laws, stores selling X-rated material are abundant in major cities, advertising openly, as these laws are rarely enforced.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Ratings for the X18+ category were tightened in 2000 to ban material featuring some fetishes or which appeared to include minors.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In 2007 the [[Northern Territory National Emergency Response]] introduced by the [[Howard Government]] made the possession of RC and X18+ pornography an offence in some Aboriginal communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|title=Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Northern Territory National Emergency Response and Other Measures) Bill 2007|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/library/pubs/bd/2007-08/08bd021.pdf|date=13 August 2007|number=21|type=Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
In [[New Zealand]], pornography is generally treated in a liberal manner and very little is banned by the [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (New Zealand)|Office of Film and Literature Classification]]. However, the most extreme forms of pornography (such as [[child pornography]], [[rape]], [[incest]] and [[bestiality]]) are classified as objectionable material by the OFLC, effectively banning them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pornography in New Zealand: do we really still need to be concerned?|url=https://www.classificationoffice.govt.nz/blog/pornography-in-nz/|date=19 January 2016|author= Deputy Chief Censor Jared Mullen|publisher=Office of Film and Literature Classification}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Papua New Guinea ===
In [[Papua New Guinea]], the possession, import, export, and sale of pornography are all offenses. Control is strict. According to the government, all websites containing pornography, [[nudity]] or depictions of sex are blocked and the government has been blocking such sites since early 2009. Under the law, persons who possess, own, import, export, sell or exhibit pornography to the public are subject to arrest and trial and can face up to 6 months' imprisonment and/or a fine up to 50,000 to 100,000 [[Papua New Guinean kina]].&lt;ref name=Durham&gt;{{cite book|last=Durham|first=Sarah|year=2015|title=Opposing Pornography: A look at the Anti-Pornography Movement|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MTDJCgAAQBAJ|publisher=Lulu.com|page=61|isbn=9781329607644}}&lt;/ref&gt; In PNG, pornography is subject to legal restraints to publication on grounds of obscenity. Laws relating to pornography in Papua New Guinea are vague. The main legislation used in dealing with cases relating to pornographic nature refer back to the Chapter 262 Criminal Code of Papua New Guinea, Lukautim Pikinini Act 2009, Classification of Publication Censorship Act 1989 and the National ICT Act, 2009.

=== Argentina ===
[[Argentina]] is emerging as another source for [[transsexual pornography]]{{reference needed|date=February 2013}}, with several titles already produced by major American companies (e.g., [[Anabolic Video]]). Argentina is also widely used to shoot pornographic clips straight for the Internet, as well as for photoshoots. Films shot in Argentina typically have the male performers wearing condoms.{{reference needed|date=February 2013}}

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, [[pornographic film actor]]s must be 18 or older. Pornography which does not involve bestiality is legal when sold in public places. Depiction of sex with animals is legal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://revistagalileu.globo.com/Revista/Common/0,,EMI112289-17799,00-ALGUEM+JA+FOI+PRESO+POR+ZOOFILIA+NO+BRASIL.html Revista Galileu - ''not''√çCIAS - Algu√©m j√° foi preso por zoofilia no Brasil?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[magazine]] and DVD covers that depict genitalia must not be visible from public view, and pornography can only be sold to people 18 or older.

=== Guyana ===
In [[Guyana]], it is illegal to sell or possess pornography. Distribution, possession, sale, and importation of pornographic magazines, DVDs, books, photographs, etc. or simply browsing for pornographic websites on the Internet can lead to a variety of punishments ranging from community service, a fine of up to 45,000 Guyana dollars, up to 2 years in prison, or [[corporal punishment]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

'''Poƒçitelj''' is a village in the [[ƒåapljina]] municipality in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It is located in the [[Herzegovina-Neretva Canton]] in the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The historic site of Poƒçitelj is located on the left bank of the river [[Neretva]], on the main [[Mostar]] to [[Metkoviƒá]] road, and it is about 30 km to the south of [[Mostar]].

The village is built in  a natural [[karst]] amphiteatre along the Neretva river. The walled town of Poƒçitelj evolved in the period from the 16th to the 18th centuries. Architecturally, the stone-constructed parts of the town are a [[Citadel Poƒçitelj|fortified complex]], in which two stages of evolution are evident: medieval, and Ottoman.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5092/UNESCO: The historic urban site of Poƒçitelj &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
The first recorded reference to Poƒçitelj dates from 1444, in charters by King [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] and in 1448 by [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]]. {{cn-span|It was mentioned as a fortified town  of the Dubrava district, ruled by Duke Stjepan Vukƒçiƒç Kosaƒça.|date=August 2016}} In the period between 1463-1471 the town housed a Hungarian garrison and was fortified into a strategic defence stronghold.  In 1471, following a brief siege, the town was conquered by the Ottomans. It lost its strategic significance. It remained within the [[Ottoman Empire]] until 1878. From 1782 to 1879 Poƒçitelj was the seat of a''kadiluk'' (area under the jurisdiction of a [[qadi]], or judge) and the center of the Poƒçitelj military district from 1713 to 1835.

The significance and the town's appearance has altered during the course of its history.  As far as the development of Poƒçitelj goes, three significant periods can be distinguished: 
# The period of the Hungarian King [[Matthias Corvinus]] during which the town had a major strategic importance (1463‚Äì1471)
# The period of the settlement development under the Ottoman Empire with the erection of public buildings: mosques, [[imaret]], [[maktab]], [[madrasa]], [[Turkish bath|hamam]], [[caravanserai|han]] and the clock-tower (1471‚Äì1698). 
# The period after the Venetians conquered and destroyed [[Gabela]] (1698‚Äì1878), the main Ottoman fortification facing [[Dalmatia]], and recovery of Poƒçitelj's strategic importance.

After the establishment of Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, Poƒçitelj lost its strategic importance and started deteriorating rapidly. The population declined gradually. The loss of the town's strategic role assisted in the preservation of the original urban architectural ensemble, so that the town remained in its original form to present day.

The entire historic urban site of Poƒçitelj and surrounding area suffered extensive collateral damage during the 1992-1996 [[war in Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Namely, it was heavily damaged by Croatian forces during the 1993 [[Bosnian War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gort|first=Jerald|title=Religion, Conflict and Reconciliation: Multifaith Ideals and Realities|year=2002|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=90-420-1460-1|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="layton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Layton|first=Robert|title=Destruction and Conservation of Cultural Property|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-21695-8|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sells"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sells|first=Michael|title=The Bridge Betrayed: Religion and Genocide in Bosnia|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-21662-8|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the bombing, Poƒçitelj's sixteenth-century master works of Islamic art and architecture were destroyed and a large part of the town's population was displaced.&lt;ref name="layton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sells"/&gt;

As proposed by the University of York, United Kingdom, and the University of Sarajevo, Poƒçitelj was in 1996 named by the [[World Monuments Watch]] as one of the world's 100 most endangered cultural heritage sites.
In  the year 2000 the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Government initiated the Programme of the permanent protection of Poƒçitelj. The programme includes the protection of cultural heritage from deterioration, restoration of damaged and destroyed buildings, encouraging the return of the refugees and displaced persons to their homes and the long-term protection and revitalization of the Poƒçitelj's historic urban area.

As of 2008, the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) expressed concern over the proposed construction of a nearby highway, Corridor Vc.  Initial plans include a 1,000-meter long, 100-meter high bridge over the Neretva river.  It is feared that the construction will result in a ‚Äúphysical, visual and ecological degradation and devastation of this cultural and historical unity and its authentic surroundings.‚Äù &lt;ref&gt;ICOMOS Bosnia-Herzegovina (2008).

==Historic sites==
* The '''Gavrakanpetanoviƒá house''': built at the end of the 16th century, it was named after and housed the captains of Poƒçitelj, who belonged to the Gavrakanpetanoviƒç family. It is typical example of the residential architecture of the village. It is the only house in town to have separate rooms for men and women. The house became the residence of an artists' colony between 1961 and 1975, one of which was the Italian painter [[Vittorio Miele]]. This was the longest operating artist colony in Southeast Europe. During the Bosnian war, the house was set on fire. It was restored in its original state in 2003.
* The '''≈†i≈°man Ibrahim-pa≈°ina d≈æamija''' or '''Hajji Alija''' mosque: built in 1563 by Hajji-Alija, son of Musa. It was repaired in the 17th century by ≈†i≈°man Ibrahim pasha. The locals gave the mosque afterwards his name. The domed mosque is notable for its special acoustics. The mosque was restored in the 1970s, but badly damaged during the Bosnian War in 1993. It was restored again in 2002.
* The '''Kula''', a silo-shaped fort overlooking the village from the top of the hill. It used to house watchmen and military as a guard against possible intrusions from the Neretva valley.
* The '''Sahat Kula''', a bell tower located closer to the river and at the south side of the old town.

== Demographics ==
No up-to-date data currently exists for Poƒçitelj and its demographic profile was significantly altered after the Bosnian war. The last demographics research was conducted in 1991 and its results were as follows:

Population Total: 905&lt;ref&gt;Official results from the book: Ethnic composition of Bosnia-Herzegovina population, by municipalities and settlements, 1991. census, Zavod za statistiku Bosne i Hercegovine - Bilten no.234, Sarajevo 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Muslims (nationality)|Muslims]] - 660 (72.92%)
* [[Croats]] - 172 (19.00%)
* [[Yugoslavs]] - 36 (3.97%)
* [[Serbs]] - 20 (2.20%)
* others and unknown - 17 (1.87%)

== Significance ==
Poƒçitelj represents one of the few urban ensembles in Bosnia and Herzegovina that were preserved in their integrity to the present times. It was also developed through the several phases of the history beginning with the medieval period. Its significant strategic role from the 13th to 17th century gave its inhabitants the power to build one of the most important, and best preserved ensembles within the city walls in the region. 
The town can be compared with some of the noted world heritage sites as the old towns of Mostar (Bosnia and Herzegovina), [[Ohrid]] ([[Republic of Macedonia]]), [[Safranbolu]] (Turkey), [[Gjirokaster]] (Albania). Poƒçitelj's layout and use of building materials put it into the group of Ottoman-Mediterranean types of small settlements.&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;

The '''privacy laws of the United States''' deal with several different [[law|legal]] concepts. One is the ''invasion of privacy'', a [[tort]] based in common law allowing an aggrieved party to bring a lawsuit against an individual who unlawfully intrudes into his or her private affairs, discloses his or her private information, publicizes him or her in a false light, or appropriates his or her name for personal gain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/i/invasion-of-privacy/ "Invasion of Privacy Law &amp; Legal Definition"], US Legal. Retrieved October 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public figure]]s have less privacy, and this is an evolving area of law as it relates to the [[Mass media|media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://soapboxie.com/social-issues/Do-Public-Figures-have-Privacy-Rights|title=Do Public Figures have Privacy Rights?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essence of the law derives from a ''right to privacy'', defined broadly as "the right to be let alone." It usually excludes personal matters or activities which may reasonably be of public interest, like those of celebrities or participants in newsworthy events. Invasion of the right to privacy can be the basis for a lawsuit for damages against the person or entity violating the right.  These include the [[Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|Fourth Amendment]] right to be free of unwarranted search or seizure, the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to free assembly, and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] due process right, recognized by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] as protecting a general right to privacy within family, marriage, motherhood, procreation, and child rearing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/r/right-to-privacy/ "Right to Privacy Law &amp; Legal Definition"], US Legal.

==Right to privacy==
===Early years===
The early years in the development of privacy rights began with [[English common law]] which protected "only the physical interference of life and property". The Castle doctrine analogizes a person's home to his or her castle ‚Äì a site that is private and should not be accessible without permission of the owner. The development of tort remedies by the common law is "one of the most significant chapters in the history of privacy law".&lt;ref name=Solove&gt;Solove, Daniel J., Marc Rotenberg, and Paul M. Schwartz (2006), [http://www.aspenpublishers.com/Product.asp?catalog_name=Aspen&amp;product_id=0735510423 ''Privacy, Information, and Technology''], Aspen Publishers, pp. 9‚Äì11, {{ISBN|0-7355-6245-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Those rights expanded to include a "recognition of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and his intellect." Eventually, the scope of those rights broadened even further to include a basic "right to be let alone," and the former definition of "property" would then comprise "every form of possession ‚Äì intangible, as well as tangible." By the late 19th century, interest in privacy grew as a result of the growth of print media, especially newspapers.&lt;ref name=Solove/&gt;

Between 1850 and 1890, U.S. newspaper circulation grew by 1,000 percent‚Äîfrom 100 papers with 800,000 readers to 900 papers with more than 8 million readers.&lt;ref name=Solove/&gt; In addition, newspaper journalism became more sensationalized, and was termed [[yellow journalism]]. The growth of industrialism led to rapid advances in technology, including the handheld camera, as opposed to earlier [[History of the camera#Dry plates|studio cameras]], which were much heavier and larger. In 1884, [[Eastman Kodak]] company introduced their [[Kodak Brownie]], and it became a [[mass market]] camera by 1901, cheap enough for the general public. This allowed people and journalists to take candid snapshots in public places for the first time.

[[Samuel D. Warren (US attorney)|Samuel D. Warren]] and [[Louis D. Brandeis]], partners in a new law firm, feared that this new small camera technology would be used by the "sensationalistic press." Seeing this becoming a likely challenge to individual privacy rights, they wrote the "pathbreaking"&lt;ref name=Solove/&gt; ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' article in 1890, "The Right to Privacy".&lt;ref name=Brandeis&gt;Samuel Warren and Louis D. Brandeis (1890), [http://www.law.louisville.edu/library/collections/brandeis/node/225 "The Right To Privacy"], ''Harvard Law Review'' (Vol. 4, No. 193). Retrieved 17 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; According to legal scholar [[Roscoe Pound]], the article did "nothing less than add a chapter to our law",&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Alpheus Thomas (1946), [http://www.worldcat.org/title/brandeis-a-free-mans-life/oclc/76869463 ''Brandeis: A Free Man's Life''], Viking Press, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1966 legal textbook author, [[Harry Kalven]], hailed it as the "most influential law review article of all".&lt;ref name=Solove/&gt; In the Supreme Court case of ''[[Kyllo v. United States]]'', 533 U.S. 27 (2001), the article was cited by a majority of justices, both those concurring and those dissenting.&lt;ref name=Solove/&gt;

===Brandeis and Warren article===
The development of the doctrine regarding the tort of "invasion of privacy" was largely spurred by the Warren and Brandeis article, "The Right to Privacy". In it, they explain why they wrote the article in its introduction: "Political, social, and economic changes entail the recognition of new rights, and the common law, in its eternal youth, grows to meet the demands of society".&lt;ref name=Brandeis/&gt; More specifically, they also shift their focus on newspapers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The press is overstepping in every direction the obvious bounds of propriety and of decency. Gossip is no longer the resource of the idle and of the vicious, but has become a trade, which is pursued with industry as well as effrontery. To satisfy a prurient taste the details of sexual relations are spread broadcast in the columns of the daily papers....The intensity and complexity of life, attendant upon advancing civilization, have rendered necessary some retreat from the world, and man, under the refining influence of culture, has become more sensitive to publicity, so that solitude and privacy have become more essential to the individual; but modern enterprise and invention have, through invasions upon his privacy, subjected him to mental pain and distress, far greater than could be inflicted by mere bodily injury.&lt;ref name=Brandeis/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They then clarify their goals: "It is our purpose to consider whether the existing law affords a principle which can properly be invoked to protect the privacy of the individual; and, if it does, what the nature and extent of such protection is".&lt;ref name=Brandeis/&gt;

Warren and Brandeis write that privacy rights should protect both businesses and private individuals. They describe rights in [[trade secrets]] and unpublished literary materials, regardless whether those rights are invaded intentionally or unintentionally, and without regard to any value they may have. For private individuals, they try to define how to protect "thoughts, sentiments, and emotions, expressed through the medium of writing or of the arts". They describe such things as personal diaries and letters needing protection, and how that should be done: "Thus, the courts, in searching for some principle upon which the publication of private letters could be enjoined, naturally came upon the ideas of a [[breach of confidence]], and of an [[implied contract]]". They also define this as a breach of trust, where a person has trusted that another will not publish their personal writings, photographs, or artwork, without their permission, including any "facts relating to his private life, which he has seen fit to keep private". And recognizing that technological advances will become more relevant, they write: "Now that modern devices afford abundant opportunities for the perpetration of such wrongs without any participation by the injured party, the protection granted by the law must be placed upon a broader foundation".&lt;ref name=Brandeis/&gt;

==Modern tort law==

In the United States today,{{when|date=March 2018}} "invasion of privacy" is a commonly used [[cause of action]] in legal [[pleading]]s. Modern tort law, as first categorized by William Prosser, includes four categories of invasion of privacy:&lt;ref&gt;William Prosser (1960), [http://www.californialawreview.org/assets/pdfs/misc/prosser_privacy.pdf "Privacy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019050717/http://www.californialawreview.org/assets/pdfs/misc/prosser_privacy.pdf |date=2013-10-19 }}, ''California Law Review'' (Vol 48, No. 3, pp. 383‚Äì423). Retrieved 17 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Intrusion of [[solitude]]''': physical or electronic intrusion into one's private quarters
* '''Public disclosure of private facts''': the dissemination of truthful private information which a reasonable person would find objectionable
* '''False light''': the publication of facts which place a person in a false light, even though the facts themselves may not be defamatory
* '''Appropriation''': the unauthorized use of a person's name or likeness to obtain some benefits

===Intrusion of solitude and seclusion===
Intrusion of solitude occurs where one person intrudes upon the private affairs of another. In a famous case from 1944, author [[Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings]] was sued by Zelma Cason, who was portrayed as a character in Rawlings' acclaimed memoir, ''Cross Creek''.&lt;ref&gt;''Cason v. Baskin'', 20 So. 2d 243 (Fla. 1944) (note: Baskin was Rawlings' married name).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Florida Supreme Court]] held that a cause of action for invasion of privacy was supported by the facts of the case, but in a later proceeding found that there were no actual damages.

Intrusion upon seclusion occurs when a perpetrator intentionally intrudes, physically, electronically, or otherwise, upon the private space, solitude, or seclusion of a person, or the private affairs or concerns of a person, by use of the perpetrator's physical senses or by electronic device or devices to oversee or overhear the person's private affairs, or by some other form of investigation, examination, or observation intrude upon a person's private matters if the intrusion would be highly offensive to a reasonable person. Hacking into someone else's computer is a type of intrusion upon privacy,&lt;ref name=sunysb-CSE334&gt;{{cite web |title=The Right to Privacy |url=http://www.cvc.sunysb.edu/334/ethics/Privacy.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514050702/http://www.cvc.sunysb.edu/334/ethics/Privacy.html |archivedate=May 14, 2012 |work=CSE334: Introduction to Multimedia Systems |publisher=SUNY Stony Brook |accessdate=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is secretly viewing or recording private information by still or video camera.&lt;ref name="USATODAY"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/02/school-district-accused-of-issuing-webcam-laptops-to-spy-on-students/1|author=Doug Stanglin|title=School district accused of spying on kids via laptop webcams|date=February 18, 2010|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=February 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In determining whether intrusion has occurred, one of three main considerations may be involved:  [[expectation of privacy]]; whether there was an intrusion, invitation, or exceedance of invitation; or deception, misrepresentation, or fraud to gain admission.  Intrusion is "an information-gathering, not a publication, tort‚Ä¶legal wrong occurs at the time of the intrusion. No publication is necessary".&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:oWiIIh18g4oJ:www.ibiblio.org/medialaw/JOMC164unit07(privacy).ppt+emotional+distress+false+light&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3&amp;gl=us] {{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restrictions against the invasion of privacy encompasses journalists as well:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The First Amendment has never been construed to accord newsmen immunity from torts or crimes committed during the course of newsgathering. The First Amendment is not a license to trespass, to steal, or to intrude by electronic means into the precincts of another's home or office.&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dietemann v. Time Inc.'' (9th Cir. 1971)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Public disclosure===
Public disclosure of private facts arises where one person reveals information which is not of public concern, and the release of which would offend a reasonable person.&lt;ref&gt;Joey Senat (2000), [https://web.archive.org/web/20130424122836/http://www.cas.okstate.edu/jb/faculty/senat/jb3163/privacytorts.html "4 Common Law Privacy Torts" (archive.org, 2013)].&lt;/ref&gt;
"Unlike libel or slander, truth is not a defense for invasion of privacy."&lt;ref name=sunysb-CSE334/&gt; Disclosure of private facts includes publishing or widespread dissemination of little-known, private facts that are non-newsworthy, not part of public records, public proceedings, not of public interest, and would be offensive to a reasonable person if made public.&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"/&gt;

===False light===
{{main|False light}}
False light is a [[legal]] term that refers to a [[tort]] concerning [[privacy]] that is similar to the tort of [[defamation]]. For example, the privacy laws in the United States include a [[Public figure|non-public person's]] right to privacy from [[publicity]] which puts them in a false light to the [[general public|public]]. A non-public person's right to privacy from publicity is balanced against the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right of [[free speech]].

False light [[law]]s are "intended primarily to protect the [[plaintiff]]'s [[mind|mental]] or [[emotion]]al well-being".&lt;ref name=martin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://netlaw.samford.edu/Martin/AdvancedTorts/falselight.htm |title=False Light |first=Edward C. |last=Martin |publisher=[[Cumberland School of Law]], [[Samford University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227192826/http://netlaw.samford.edu/Martin/AdvancedTorts/falselight.htm |archivedate=February 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a [[publication]] of [[information]] is [[Falsity|false]], then a tort of [[defamation]] might have occurred. If that [[communication]] is not [[technicality|technically]] false but is still [[misleading]], then a tort of false light might have occurred.&lt;ref name=martin/&gt;

The specific elements of the Tort of false light vary considerably even among those [[jurisdiction]]s which do recognize this tort. Generally, these elements consist of the following:
* A publication by the [[defendant]] about the [[plaintiff]];
* Made with actual [[Malice (legal term)|malice]] (very similar to that type required by ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan|New York Times v. Sullivan]]'' in defamation cases);
* Places the plaintiff in a false light; and
* [[Morality|Highly offensive]] (i.e., [[embarrassment|embarrassing]] to [[reasonable person]]s)&lt;ref name=martin/&gt;

Thus in general, the doctrine of false light holds:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One who gives publicity to a matter concerning another before the public in a false light is subject to liability to the other for invasion of privacy, if (a)&amp;nbsp;the false light in which the other was placed would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and (b)&amp;nbsp;the actor had knowledge of or acted in a reckless disregard as to the falsity of the publicized matter and the false light in which the other would be placed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomwbell.com/NetLaw/Ch05/R2ndTorts.html ''Restatement 2d of Torts'' ¬ß 652E (1977)], The American Law Institute. Retrieved October 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For this wrong, money damages may be recovered from the first person by the other.

At first glance, this may appear to be similar to [[defamation]] (libel and slander), but the basis for the harm is different, and the remedy is different in two respects. First, unlike libel and slander, no showing of actual harm or damage to the plaintiff is usually required in false light cases, and the court will determine the amount of damages. Second, being a violation of a Constitutional right of privacy, there may be no applicable statute of limitations in some jurisdictions specifying a time limit within which period a claim must be filed.

Consequently, although it is infrequently invoked, in some cases false light may be a more attractive cause of action for plaintiffs than libel or slander, because the burden of proof may be less onerous.

What does "publicity" mean? A newspaper of general circulation (or comparable breadth) or as few as 3‚Äì5 people who know the person harmed? Neither defamation nor false light has ever required everyone in society be informed by a harmful act, but the scope of "publicity" is variable. In some jurisdictions, publicity "means that the matter is made public, by communicating it to the public at large, or to so many persons that the matter must be regarded as substantially certain to become one of public knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Jack H., Donald N. Zillman, and David D. Gregory (2004) [http://openlibrary.org/books/OL3295673M/Maine_tort_law ''Maine Tort Law''], Newark: LexisNexis, {{ISBN|0327163631}}, citing [http://www.courts.state.me.us/opinions_orders/opinions/documents/00me104c.htm ''Cole v. Chandler'' (2000 ME 104)], 752 A.2d 1189, 1196. Retrieved October 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the standards of behavior governing employees of government institutions subject to a state or national Administrative Procedure Act (as in the United States) are often more demanding than those governing employees of private or business institutions like newspapers. A person acting in an official capacity for a government agency may find that their statements are not indemnified by the principle of agency, leaving them personally liable for any damages.

Example: If someone's reputation was portrayed in a false light during a personnel performance evaluation in a government agency or public university, one might be wronged if only a small number initially learned of it, or if adverse recommendations were made to only a few superiors (by a peer committee to department chair, dean, dean's advisory committee, provost, president, etc.). Settled cases suggest false light may not be effective in private school personnel cases,&lt;ref&gt;''Gautschi v. Maisel'', 565 A.2d 1009 (Me. 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; but they may be distinguishable from cases arising in public institutions.

===Appropriation of name or likeness===
{{main|Personality rights}}

Although privacy is often a common-law tort, most states have enacted statutes that prohibit the use of a person's name or image if used without consent for the commercial benefit of another person. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2001-05-01|title=Applications of pectinases in the commercial sector: a review|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960852400001188|journal=Bioresource Technology|language=en|volume=77|issue=3|pages=215‚Äì227|doi=10.1016/S0960-8524(00)00118-8|issn=0960-8524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appropriation of name or likeness occurs when a person uses the name or likeness of another person for personal gain or commercial advantage. Action for misappropriation of right of publicity protects a person against loss caused by appropriation of  personal likeness for commercial exploitation. A person's exclusive rights to control his or her name and likeness to prevent others from exploiting without permission is protected in similar manner to a trademark action with the person's likeness, rather than the trademark, being the subject of the protection.&lt;ref name=sunysb-CSE334/&gt;
Appropriation is the oldest recognized form of invasion of privacy involving the use of an individual's name, likeness, or identity without consent for purposes such as ads, fictional works, or products.&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"/&gt;

"The same action{{spaced ndash}}appropriation ‚Äîcan violate either an individual's right of privacy or right of publicity. Conceptually, however, the two rights differ".&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"/&gt;

==Constitutional basis for right to privacy==

===Federal===
{{see also|Penumbra (law)}}
Although the word "privacy" is actually never used in the text of the [[United States Constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/constitution_transcript.html |title=Charters of Freedom ‚Äì The Declaration of Independence, The Constitution, The Bill of Rights |publisher=National Archives |accessdate=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are Constitutional limits to the government's intrusion into individuals' right to privacy. This is true even when pursuing a public purpose such as exercising police powers or passing legislation. The Constitution, however, only protects against [[state actor]]s. Invasions of privacy by individuals can only be remedied under previous court decisions.

The [[Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]] ensures that "the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized".

The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protects the right to free assembly, broadening privacy rights.  Some believe that the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] declares that the fact that a right is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution does not mean that the government can infringe on that right.  The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] recognized the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] as providing a substantive due process right to privacy. This was first recognized by several Supreme Court Justices in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', a 1965 decision protecting a married couple's rights to contraception. It was recognized again in 1973 ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which invoked the right to privacy to protect a woman's right to an abortion, and in the 2003 with ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', which invoked the right to privacy regarding the sexual practices of same-sex couples.

CA SB 1386 expands on privacy law and guarantees that if a company exposes a Californian's sensitive information this exposure must be reported to the citizen.

California's Reader Privacy Act was passed into law in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Civil Code ¬ß 6267&lt;/ref&gt; The law prohibits a commercial provider of a book service, as defined, from disclosing, or being compelled to disclose, any personal information relating to a user of the book service, subject to certain exceptions. The bill would require a provider to disclose personal information of a user only if a court order has been issued, as specified, and certain other conditions have been satisfied. The bill would impose civil penalties on a provider of a book service for knowingly disclosing a user's personal information to a government entity in violation of these provisions.  This law is applicable to electronic books in addition to print books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_0601-0650/sb_602_bill_20111002_chaptered.html "SB 602: Reader Privacy Act"], ''Legislative Counsel's Digest'', Legislative Counsel, State of California, February 17, 2011.

The '''problem of evil''' refers to the question of how to reconcile the existence of [[evil]] with an [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] and [[Omniscience|omniscient]] [[God]] (see [[theism]]).&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil The Problem of Evil]", Michael Tooley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential"&gt;The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/evil-evi.htm The Evidential Problem of Evil]", Nick Trakakis&lt;/ref&gt; An '''argument from evil''' claims that because evil exists, either God does not exist or does not have all three of those properties. Attempts to show the contrary have traditionally been discussed under the heading of [[theodicy]]. Besides philosophy of religion, the problem of evil is also important to the field of [[theology]] and [[ethics]].

The problem of evil is often formulated in two forms: the logical problem of evil and the evidential problem of evil. The logical form of the argument tries to show a logical impossibility in the coexistence of God and evil,&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepLogical"/&gt; while the evidential form tries to show that given the evil in the world, it is improbable that there is an omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good God.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt; The problem of evil has been extended to non-human life forms, to include animal suffering from natural evils and human [[animal cruelty|cruelty]] against them.&lt;ref name=inwagenp120/&gt;

Responses to various versions of the problem of evil, meanwhile, come in three forms: refutations, defenses, and theodicies. A wide range of responses have been made against these arguments. There are also many discussions of evil and associated problems in other philosophical fields, such as [[secular ethics]],&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas J. Rengger, ''Moral Evil and International Relations'', in ''[[SAIS Review]]'' 25:1, Winter/Spring 2005, pp. 3‚Äì16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kivy, ''Melville's Billy and the Secular Problem of Evil: the Worm in the Bud'', in ''[[The Monist]]'' (1980), 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kekes |first=John |authorlink=John Kekes |title=Facing Evil |publisher=Princeton UP |year=1990 |location=Princeton |url= |id= |isbn=0-691-07370-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[evolutionary ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Anders, ''The Evolution of Evil'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lawrence C. Becker |author2=Charlotte B.

The problem of evil acutely applies to monotheistic religions such as [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], and [[Judaism]] that believe in a monotheistic God who is omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent;&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/hum_303/evil.html Problem of Evil], Paul Brians, Washington State University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen D.

==Formulation and detailed arguments==

The problem of evil refers to the challenge of reconciling belief in an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent God, with the existence of evil and suffering in the world.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p141"/&gt;&lt;ref name=boydp56&gt;Gregory A.

===Logical problem of evil&lt;!--'Logical problem of evil' redirects here--&gt;===
Originating with Greek philosopher [[Epicurus]],&lt;ref&gt;The formulation may have been wrongly attributed to Epicurus by Lactantius, who, from his Christian perspective, regarded Epicurus as an [[atheist]]. According to Mark Joseph Larrimore, (2001), ''The Problem of Evil'', pp. xix‚Äìxxi. Wiley-Blackwell. According to [[Reinhold F. Glei]], it is settled that the argument of theodicy is from an academical source which is not only not epicurean, but even anti-epicurean. Reinhold F. Glei, ''Et invidus et inbecillus. Das angebliche Epikurfragment bei Laktanz, De ira dei 13, 20‚Äì21'', in: ''Vigiliae Christianae'' 42 (1988), pp. 47‚Äì58&lt;/ref&gt; the '''logical argument from evil'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is as follows:

# If an [[omnipotent]], [[omnibenevolent]] and [[omniscient]] god exists, then evil does not.
# There is evil in the world.
# Therefore, an omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient god does not exist.

This argument is of the form [[modus tollens]], and is [[logically valid]]: If its premises are true, the conclusion follows of necessity.  To show that the first premise is plausible, subsequent versions tend to expand on it, such as this modern example:&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;
# God exists.
# God is omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient.
# An omnipotent being has the power to prevent that evil from coming into existence.
# An omnibenevolent being would want to prevent all evils.
# An omniscient being knows every way in which evils can come into existence, and knows every way in which those evils could be prevented.
# A being who knows every way in which an evil can come into existence, who is able to prevent that evil from coming into existence, and who wants to do so, would prevent the existence of that evil.
# If there exists an omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient God, then no evil exists.
# Evil exists (logical contradiction).

Both of these arguments are understood to be presenting two forms of the ''logical'' problem of evil. They attempt to show that the assumed [[proposition]]s lead to a [[logical]] [[contradiction]] and therefore cannot all be correct. Most philosophical debate has focused on the propositions stating that God cannot exist with, or would want to prevent, all evils (premises 3 and 6), with defenders of theism (for example, Leibniz) arguing that God could very well exist with and allow evil in order to achieve a greater good.

If God lacks any one of these qualities‚Äîomniscience, omnipotence, or omnibenevolence‚Äîthen the logical problem of evil can be resolved. [[Process theology]] and [[open theism]] are other positions that limit God's omnipotence and/or omniscience (as defined in traditional theology). [[Dystheism]] is the belief that God is not wholly good.

===Evidential problem of evil&lt;!--'Logical problem of evil' and 'Evidential argument from evil' redirect here--&gt;===
[[File:Deerfire high res edit.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[William L. Rowe]]'s example of [[natural evil]]: "In some distant forest lightning strikes a dead tree, resulting in a forest fire. In the fire a fawn is trapped, horribly burned, and lies in terrible agony for several days before death relieves its suffering."&lt;ref name=rowe336&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowe|first=William L.|authorlink=William L. Rowe|year=1979|title=The Problem of Evil and Some Varieties of Atheism|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly|volume=16|pages=336‚Äì37|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowe also cites the example of human evil where an innocent child is a victim of violence and thereby suffers.&lt;ref name=rowe336/&gt;]]

The '''evidential problem of evil'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (also referred to as the probabilistic or inductive version of the problem) seeks to show that the existence of evil, although logically consistent with the existence of God, counts against or lowers the [[probability]] of the truth of theism. As an example, a critic of Plantinga's idea of "a mighty nonhuman spirit" causing natural evils may concede that the existence of such a being is not logically impossible but argue that due to lacking scientific evidence for its existence this is very unlikely and thus it is an unconvincing explanation for the presence of natural evils. Both absolute versions and relative versions of the evidential problems of evil are presented below.

A version by [[William L. Rowe]]:
# There exist instances of intense suffering which an omnipotent, omniscient being could have prevented without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.
# An omniscient, wholly good being would prevent the occurrence of any intense suffering it could, unless it could not do so without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.
# (Therefore) There does not exist an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good being.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;

Another by [[Paul Draper (philosopher)|Paul Draper]]:
# Gratuitous evils exist.
# The hypothesis of indifference, ''i.e.'', that if there are supernatural beings they are indifferent to gratuitous evils, is a better explanation for (1) than theism.
# Therefore, evidence prefers that no god, as commonly understood by theists, exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Draper |title=Pain and Pleasure: An Evidential Problem for Theists |journal=No√ªs |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=331‚Äì50 | year=1989 |doi=10.2307/2215486 |publisher=No√ªs, Vol. 23, No. 3 |ref=harv |jstor=2215486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second version of the problem of evil applied to animals, and avoidable suffering experienced by them, is one caused by some human beings, such as from animal cruelty or when they are shot or slaughtered. This version of the problem of evil has been used by scholars including [[John Hick]] to counter the responses and defenses to the problem of evil such as suffering being a means to perfect the morals and greater good because animals are innocent, helpless, amoral but sentient victims.&lt;ref name=inwagenp120/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Diogenes Allen |editor=Marilyn McCord Adams and Robert Merrihew Adams|title=The Problem of Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqNwUSj7U7QC |year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-824866-8 |pages=204‚Äì06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William L.

Responses to the problem of evil have occasionally been classified as ''defences'' or ''theodicies;'' however, authors disagree on the exact definitions.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia |first=Ted |last=Honderich |authorlink=Ted Honderich |year=2005 |title=theodicy |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |quote=[[John Hick]], for example, proposes a theodicy, while [[Alvin Plantinga]] formulates a defence. The idea of human free will often appears in a both of these strategies, but in different ways.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, a ''defense'' against the problem of evil may refer to attempts to defuse the logical problem of evil by showing that there is no logical incompatibility between the existence of evil and the existence of God. This task does not require the identification of a plausible explanation of evil, and is successful if the explanation provided shows that the existence of God and the existence of evil are logically compatible. It need not even be true, since a false though coherent explanation would be sufficient to show logical compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;For more explanation regarding contradictory propositions and possible worlds, see Plantinga's "God, Freedom and Evil" (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans 1974), 24‚Äì29.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[theodicy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Coined by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] from [[Greek language|Greek]] Œ∏ŒµœåœÇ (the√≥s), "god" and Œ¥ŒØŒ∫Œ∑ (d√≠kƒì), "justice", may refer to the project of "justifying God"‚Äîshowing that God's existence is compatible with the existence of evil.&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, is more ambitious, since it attempts to provide a plausible justification‚Äîa morally or philosophically sufficient reason‚Äîfor the existence of evil and thereby rebut the "evidential" argument from evil.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt; [[Richard Swinburne]] maintains that it does not make sense to assume there are greater goods that justify the evil's presence in the world unless we know what they are‚Äîwithout knowledge of what the greater goods could be, one cannot have a successful theodicy.&lt;ref name=swinburne05&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia |first=Richard |last=Swinburne |authorlink=Richard Swinburne |year=2005 |title=evil, the problem of |editor=Ted Honderich |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |editor-link=Ted Honderich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, some authors see arguments appealing to [[demon]]s or the [[fall of man]] as indeed logically possible, but not very ''plausible'' given our knowledge about the world, and so see those arguments as providing defences but not good theodicies.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;

The above argument is set against numerous versions of the problem of evil that have been formulated.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepLogical"&gt;The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/evil-log.htm The Logical Problem of Evil]", James R. Beebe&lt;/ref&gt; These versions have included philosophical and theological formulations.

===Skeptical theism===
{{Main|Skeptical theism}}
Skeptical theism defends the problem of evil by asserting that God allows an evil to happen in order to prevent a greater evil or to encourage a response that will lead to a greater good.&lt;ref name=wilks31&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Wilks |editor=Justin P. McBrayer and Daniel Howard-Snyder|title=The Blackwell Companion to The Problem of Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0ScAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1-118-60797-8 |chapter=Chapter 31, for context see Chapters 29 and 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a rape or a murder of an innocent child is defended as having a God's purpose that a human being may not comprehend, but which may lead to lesser evil or greater good.&lt;ref name=wilks31/&gt; This is called skeptical theism because the argument aims to encourage self-skepticism, either by trying to rationalize God's possible hidden motives, or by trying to explain it as a limitation of human ability to know.&lt;ref name=wilks31/&gt;&lt;ref name="DoughertyMcBrayer2014"/&gt; The greater good defense is more often argued in religious studies in response to the evidential version of the problem of evil,&lt;ref name="DoughertyMcBrayer2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Trent Dougherty|author2=Justin P.

==== "Greater good" responses ====
The [[omnipotence paradox]]es, where evil persists in the presence of an all powerful God, raise questions as to the nature of God's omnipotence. There is the further question of how an interference would negate and subjugate the concept of free will, or in other words result in a totalitarian system that creates a lack of freedom. Some solutions propose that omnipotence does not require the ability to actualize the logically impossible. "Greater good" responses to the problem make use of this insight by arguing for the existence of goods of great value which God cannot actualize without also permitting evil, and thus that there are evils he cannot be expected to prevent despite being omnipotent. Among the most popular versions of the "greater good" response are appeals to the apologetics of free will. Theologians will argue that since no one can fully understand God's ultimate plan, no one can assume that evil actions do not have some sort of greater purpose. Therefore, they say nature of evil has a necessary role to play in God's plan for a better world.&lt;ref name=WhitneyTheodicy&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitney|first1=B|title=Theodicy|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=nysl_ce_colgul&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R1&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3407710979&amp;&amp;docId=GALE%7CCX3407710979&amp;docType=GALE|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher=Gale|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will====
{{main|Free will}}

The problem of evil is sometimes explained as a consequence of [[free will]], an ability granted by God.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"/&gt; Free will is both a source of good and of evil, and with free will also comes the potential for abuse, as when individuals act immorally. People with free will "decide to cause suffering and act in other evil ways", states Boyd, and it is they who make that choice, not God.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt; Further, the free will argument asserts that it would be logically inconsistent for God to prevent evil by coercion and curtailing free will, because that would no longer be free will.&lt;ref name=boydp69&gt;Gregory A. Boyd, ''Is God to Blame?'' (InterVarsity Press, 2003) {{ISBN|978-0830823949}}, pp. 55‚Äì58, 69‚Äì70, 76, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"/&gt;

Critics of the free will response have questioned whether it accounts for the degree of evil seen in this world. One point in this regard is that while the value of free will may be thought sufficient to counterbalance minor evils, it is less obvious that it outweighs the negative attributes of evils such as rape and murder. Particularly egregious cases known as horrendous evils, which "[constitute] [[prima facie]] reason to doubt whether the participant‚Äôs life could (given their inclusion in it) be a great good to him/her on the whole," have been the focus of recent work in the problem of evil.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marilyn McCord Adams]], ''Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God'' (Cornell University, 2000), 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Another point is that those actions of free beings which bring about evil very often diminish the freedom of those who suffer the evil; for example the murder of a young child prevents the child from ever exercising their free will. In such a case the freedom of an innocent child is pitted against the freedom of the evil-doer, it is not clear why God would remain unresponsive and passive.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marilyn McCord Adams]], ''Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God'' (Melbourne University Press, 1999), 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism is that the potential for evil inherent in free will may be limited by means which do not impinge on that free will. God could accomplish this by making moral actions especially pleasurable, or evil action and suffering impossible by allowing free will but not allowing the ability to enact evil or impose suffering.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis writes: "We can, perhaps, conceive of a world in which God corrected the results of this abuse of free will by His creatures at every moment: so that a wooden beam became soft as grass when it was used as a weapon, and the air refused to obey me if I attempted to set up in it the sound waves that carry lies or insults. But such a world would be one in which wrong actions were impossible, and in which, therefore, freedom of the will would be void; nay, if the principle were carried out to its logical conclusion, evil thoughts would be impossible, for the cerebral matter which we use in thinking would refuse its task when we attempted to frame them." C.S. Lewis ''[[The Problem of Pain]]'' (HarperCollins, 1996) pp. 24‚Äì25&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the free will explanation state that that would no longer be free will.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"/&gt; Critics respond that this view seems to imply it would be similarly wrong to try to reduce suffering and evil in these ways, a position which few would advocate.&lt;ref&gt;''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', s.v. "The Problem of Evil," Michael Tooley at http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third challenge to the free will defence is [[natural evil]], which is the result of natural causes (e.g. a child suffering from a disease, mass casualties from a volcano).&lt;ref&gt;"The Two Types of Evil," at http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/god/chgoodandevilrev1.shtml. Accessed 10 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The "natural evil" criticism posits that even if for some reason an all-powerful and all-benevolent God tolerated evil human actions in order to allow free will, such a God would not be expected to also tolerate natural evils because they have no apparent connection to free will.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Lacewing|title=Philosophy for AS: Epistemology and Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EoA9BAAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-63583-3 |pages=239‚Äì42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of the free will response to evil propose various explanations of natural evils. [[Alvin Plantinga]],&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=God, Freedom, and Evil |last=Plantinga |first=Alvin |year=1974 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=0-8028-1731-9 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Augustine of Hippo]],&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Plantinga, ''God, Freedom, and Evil'' (Eerdmans, 1989), 58.&lt;/ref&gt; and others have argued that natural evils are caused by the free choices of supernatural beings such as [[demon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley Hanson, ''Introduction to Christian Theology'' (Fortress, 1997), 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued
:‚Ä¢ that natural evils are the result of the [[fall of man]], which corrupted the perfect world created by God&lt;ref&gt;Linda Edwards, ''A Brief Guide'' (Westminster John Knox, 2001), 62.&lt;/ref&gt; or
:‚Ä¢ that natural evils are the result of [[natural laws]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Polkinghorne | first = John | authorlink = John Polkinghorne | title = Belief in God in an Age of Science | publisher=Yale Nota Bene | year = 2003 | location = New Haven, CT | page = 14 | isbn = 978-0-300-09949-2 }} and also See esp. ch. 5 of his ''Science and Providence''. {{ISBN|978-0-87773-490-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or
:‚Ä¢ that natural evils provide us with a knowledge of evil which makes our free choices more significant than they would otherwise be, and so our free will more valuable&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Swinburne]] in "Is There a God?" writes that "the operation of natural laws producing evils gives humans knowledge (if they choose to seek it) of how to bring about such evils themselves. Observing you can catch some disease by the operation of natural processes gives me the power either to use those processes to give that disease to other people, or through negligence to allow others to catch it, or to take measures to prevent others from catching the disease." In this way, "it increases the range of significant choice... The actions which natural evil makes possible are ones which allow us to perform at our best and interact with our fellows at the deepest level" (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996) 108‚Äì09.&lt;/ref&gt; or
:‚Ä¢ that natural evils are a mechanism of divine punishment for moral evils that humans have committed, and so the natural evil is justified.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley Hanson, ''Introduction to Christian Theology'' (Fortress, 1997), 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars agree that Plantinga's free will of human and non-human spirits (demons) argument successfully solves the logical problem of evil, proving that God and evil are logically compatible&lt;ref name=meisterp134&gt;{{cite book |title=Introducing Philosophy of Religion |last=Meister |first=Chad |year=2009 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-40327-8 |page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other scholars explicitly dissent.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, J.H. Logic and Theism. Cambridge University Press (2004) pp. 436‚Äì37&lt;/ref&gt; The dissenters state that while explaining infectious diseases, cancer, hurricanes and other nature-caused suffering as something that is caused by the free will of supernatural beings solves the logical version of the problem of evil, it is highly unlikely that these natural evils do not have natural causes that an omnipotent God could prevent, but instead are caused by the immoral actions of supernatural beings with free will whom God created.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; According to Michael Tooley, this defense is also highly implausible because suffering from natural evil is localized, rational causes and cures for major diseases have been found, and it is unclear why anyone, including a supernatural being whom God created would choose to inflict localized evil and suffering to innocent children for example, and why God fails to stop such suffering if he is omnipotent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alvin Plantinga|author2=Michael Tooley|title=Knowledge of God|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xfjbwDoPj8C |year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-0131-1 |pages=101‚Äì05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Free will and animal suffering
One of the weaknesses of the free will defense is its inapplicability or contradictory applicability with respect to evils faced by animals and the consequent animal suffering. Some scholars, such as [[David Ray Griffin|David Griffin]], state that the free will, or the assumption of greater good through free will, does not apply to animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Ray Griffin|title=Evil Revisited: Responses and Reconsiderations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1NMm1lXb4SgC |year=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0612-0 |pages=94‚Äì95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John S. Feinberg |title=The Many Faces of Evil (Revised and Expanded Edition): Theological Systems and the Problems of Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9w_vM7DgWN4C |year=2004|publisher=Crossway|isbn=978-1-4335-1727-3 |pages=94‚Äì95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a few scholars while accepting that "free will" applies in a human context, have posited an alternative "free creatures" defense, stating that animals too benefit from their physical freedom though that comes with the cost of dangers they continuously face.&lt;ref name="Nicola Hoggard Creegan 2013 48"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan|title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB1pAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-993185-9|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "free creatures" defense has also been criticized, in the case of caged, domesticated and farmed animals who are not free and many of whom have historically experienced evil and suffering from abuse by their owners. Further, even animals and living creatures in the wild face horrendous evils and suffering‚Äîsuch as burn and slow death after natural fires or other natural disasters or from predatory injuries‚Äîand it is unclear, state Bishop and Perszyk, why an all-loving God would create such free creatures prone to intense suffering.&lt;ref name="Nicola Hoggard Creegan 2013 48"/&gt; 

; Heaven and free will

There is also debate regarding the compatibility of moral free will (to select good or evil action) with the absence of evil from heaven,&lt;ref&gt;Oppy, Graham. ''Arguing about Gods'', pp. 314‚Äì39. Cambridge University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0521863864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.svri.org/evil.pdf#page=72 |title=Evil, Freedom and the Heaven Dilemma |author=Simon Cushing |year=2010 |work=Challenging Evil: Time, Society and Changing Concepts of the Meaning of Evil |publisher=Inter-Disciplinary Press |deadurl=yes |accessdate=10 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517181511/http://www.svri.org/evil.pdf#page=72 |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with God's omniscience and with his omnibenevolence.&lt;ref name="IepLogical" /&gt;

One line of extended criticism of free will defense has been that if God is perfectly powerful, knowing and loving, then he could have actualized a world with free creatures without moral evil where everyone chooses good, is always full of loving-kindness, is compassionate, always non-violent and full of joy, where earth were just like the monotheistic concept of [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]]. If God did create a heaven with his love, an all-loving and always-loving God could have created an earth without evil and suffering for animals and human beings just like heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan|title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB1pAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-993185-9|pages=48‚Äì51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Process theodicy====
"Process theodicy reframes the debate on the problem of evil by denying one of its key premises: divine omnipotence."&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|143}}  It integrates philosophical and theological commitments while shifting theological metaphors.  For example, God becomes the Great Companion and Fellow-Sufferer where the future is realized hand-in-hand with the sufferer.&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|143}}

===Soul-making or Irenaean theodicy===
{{main|Irenaean theodicy}}

The soul-making or Irenaean theodicy is named after the 2nd-century Greek theologian [[Irenaeus]], whose ideas were adopted in Eastern Christianity.&lt;ref name=johnhickp201/&gt; It has been discussed by [[John Hick]], and the Irenaean theodicy asserts that evil and [[suffering]] are necessary for spiritual growth, for man to discover his soul, and God allows evil for spiritual growth of human beings.&lt;ref name=johnhickp201&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hick|title=Evil and the God of Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMcYDAAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-349-18048-6 |pages=201‚Äì16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irenaean theodicy has been challenged with the assertion that many evils do not seem to promote spiritual growth, and can be positively destructive of the human spirit. Hick acknowledges that this process often fails in our world.&lt;ref&gt;John Hick, ''Evil and the God of Love '', (Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition 1977, 2010 reissue), 325, 336.&lt;/ref&gt; A second issue concerns the distribution of evils suffered: were it true that God permitted evil in order to facilitate spiritual growth, then we would expect evil to disproportionately befall those in poor spiritual health. This does not seem to be the case, as the decadent enjoy lives of luxury which insulate them from evil, whereas many of the pious are poor, and are well acquainted with worldly evils.&lt;ref&gt;The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "The Problem of Evil", James R. Beebe&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, states Kane, human character can be developed directly or in constructive and nurturing loving ways, and it is unclear why God would consider or allow evil and suffering to be necessary or the preferred way to spiritual growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hick|title=Evil and the God of Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMcYDAAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-349-18048-6 |pages=376‚Äì79 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, horrendous suffering often leads to dehumanization, its victims in truth do not grow spiritually but become vindictive and spiritually worse.&lt;ref name=Creeganp185/&gt;

This reconciliation of the problem of evil and God, states Creegan, also fails to explain the need or rationale for evil inflicted on animals and resultant animal suffering, because "there is no evidence at all that suffering improves the character of animals, or is evidence of soul-making in them".&lt;ref name=Creeganp185&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan |title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWSL-zZ5x4QC |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-993184-2 |page=185 with footnote 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a more fundamental level, the soul-making theodicy assumes that the virtues developed through suffering are intrinsically, as opposed to instrumentally, good. The virtues identified as "soul-making" only appear to be valuable in a world where evil and suffering already exist. A willingness to sacrifice oneself in order to save others from persecution, for example, is virtuous precisely because persecution exists. Likewise, we value the willingness to donate one's meal to those who are starving because starvation exists. If persecution and starvation did not occur, there would be no reason to consider these acts virtuous. If the virtues developed through soul-making are only valuable where suffering exists, then it is not clear that we would lose anything if suffering did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rationalrealm.com/downloads/philosophy/ProblemOfEvil.pdf|website=Rational Realm|title=The Problem of Evil|first=Leslie|last=Allan|date=28 July 2015|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cruciform theodicy====
Soul-making theodicy and Process theodicy are full theodical systems with distinctive cosmologies, theologies and perspectives on the problem of evil; cruciform theodicy is not a system but is a thematic trajectory within them.  As a result, it does not address all the questions of "the origin, nature, problem, reason and end of evil,"&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|145}} but it does represent an important change. "On July 16, 1944 awaiting execution in a [[Nazi]] prison and reflecting on Christ's experience of powerlessness and pain, [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] penned six words that became the clarion call for the modern theological paradigm shift: 'Only the suffering God can help."&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|146}}  Classic theism includes "impassability" (God cannot suffer personally) as a necessary characteristic of God. Cruciform theodicy begins with Jesus' suffering "the entire spectrum of human sorrow, including economic exploitation, political disenfranchisement, social ostracism, rejection and betrayal by friends, even alienation from his own family...deep psychological distress... [grief]..." ridicule, humiliation, abandonment, beating, torture, despair, and death.&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|146,148}}

Theologian [[J√ºrgen Moltmann]] asserts the "passibility" of God saying "A God who cannot suffer cannot love."&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|150}} Philosopher and Christian priest [[Marilyn McCord Adams]] offers a theodicy of "redemptive suffering" which proposes that innocent suffering shows the "transformative power of redemption" rather than that God is not omnibenevolent.&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|158‚Äì168}}

===Afterlife===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] suggested the [[afterlife]] theodicy to address the problem of evil and to justifying the existence of evil.&lt;ref name="stump2008p49"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wDHCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49 | title=The Evidential Argument from Evil | publisher=Indiana University Press | author=Eleonore Stump | editor=Daniel Howard-Snyder | year=2008 | pages=49‚Äì52 | isbn=0-253-11409-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premise behind this theodicy is that the afterlife is unending, human life is short, and God allows evil and suffering in order to judge and grant everlasting heaven or hell based on human moral actions and human suffering.&lt;ref name=stump2008p49/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goetz2008p139"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benjamin W. McCraw|author2=Robert Arp|title=The Problem of Evil: New Philosophical Directions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oUA1CwAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Lexington|isbn=978-1-4985-1208-4 |pages=132‚Äì33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas says that the afterlife is the greater good that justifies the evil and suffering in current life.&lt;ref name=stump2008p49/&gt; Christian author [[Randy Alcorn]] argues that the joys of [[heaven]] will compensate for the sufferings on earth.&lt;ref&gt;If God Is Good: Faith in the Midst of Suffering and Evil, published by Random House of Canada, 2009, p. 294; Quote: Without this eternal perspective, we assume that people who die young, who have handicaps, who suffer poor health, who don't get married or have children, or who don't do this or that will miss out on the best life has to offer.  But the theology underlying these assumptions have a fatal flaw.  It presumes that our present Earth, bodies, culture, relationships and lives are all there is... [but] Heaven will bring far more than compensation for our present sufferings.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Maitzen has called this the "Heaven Swamps Everything" theodicy, and argues that it is false because it conflates compensation and justification.&lt;ref name="Goetz2008p139"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stewart Goetz|title=Freedom, Teleology, and Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cZmvAwAAQBAJ |year=2008|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-7183-2 |pages=139‚Äì47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.acadiau.ca/tl_files/sites/philosophy/resources/documents/Maitzen_OMIA.pdf "Ordinary Morality Implies Atheism"], European Journal for Philosophy of Religion 1:2 (2009), 107‚Äì26, Quote: "... may stem from imagining an ecstatic or forgiving state of mind on the part of the blissful: in heaven no one bears grudges, even the most horrific earthly suffering is as nothing compared to infinite bliss, all past wrongs are forgiven. But "are forgiven" doesn‚Äôt mean "were justified"; the blissful person‚Äôs disinclination to dwell on his or her earthly suffering doesn‚Äôt imply that a perfect being was justified in permitting the suffering all along. By the same token, our ordinary moral practice recognizes a legitimate complaint about child abuse even if, as adults, its victims should happen to be on drugs that make them uninterested in complaining. Even if heaven swamps everything, it doesn‚Äôt thereby justify everything."&lt;/ref&gt;

A second objection to the afterlife theodicy is that it does not reconcile the suffering of small babies and innocent children from diseases, abuse, and injury in war or terror attacks, since "human moral actions" are not to be expected from babies and uneducated/mentored children.&lt;ref name=jolley2014p66/&gt; Similarly, moral actions and the concept of choice do not apply to the problem of evil applied to animal suffering caused by natural evil or the actions of human beings.&lt;ref name=jolley2014p66&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Jolley|editor=Larry M.

===Deny evil exists===
In the second century, Christian theologists attempted to reconcile the problem of evil with an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God, by denying that evil exists. Among these theologians, [[Clement of Alexandria]] offered several theodicies, of which one was called "privation theory of evil" which was adopted thereafter.&lt;ref name="Kelly2002p42"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Francis Kelly|title=The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg2RJAIZ4k4C&amp;pg=PA42 |year=2002|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5104-9 |page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is a more modern version of "deny evil", suggested by Christian Science, wherein the perception of evil is described as a form of illusion.&lt;ref name="Millard J. Erickson 2007, page 445-446"/&gt;

====Evil as the absence of good (privation theory)====
{{Main|Absence of good}}

The early version of "deny evil" is called the "privation theory of evil", so named because it described evil as a form of "lack, loss or privation". One of the earliest proponents of this theory was the 2nd-century Clement of Alexandria, who according to Joseph Kelly,&lt;ref name="Kelly2002p42"/&gt; stated that "since God is completely good, he could not have created evil; but if God did not create evil, then it cannot exist". Evil, according to Clement, does not exist as a positive, but exists as a negative or as a "lack of good".&lt;ref name="Kelly2002p42"/&gt; Clement's idea was criticised for its inability to explain suffering in the world, if evil did not exist. He was also pressed by Gnostics scholars with the question as to why God did not create creatures that "did not lack the good". Clement attempted to answer these questions ontologically through dualism, an idea found in the Platonic school,&lt;ref name=jeffrey49&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Jeffery |title=Evil and International Relations: Human Suffering in an Age of Terror |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WyADAAAQBAJ |year=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-0-230-61035-4 |page=49 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is by presenting two realities, one of God and Truth, another of human and perceived experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Francis Kelly|title=The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg2RJAIZ4k4C&amp;pg=PA42 |year=2002|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5104-9 |pages=42‚Äì43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth-century theologian [[Augustine of Hippo]] adopted the privation theory, and in his ''Enchiridion on Faith, Hope and Love'', maintained that evil exists only as "absence of the good", that vices are nothing but the privations of natural good.&lt;ref name=jeffrey49/&gt; Evil is not a substance, states Augustine, it is nothing more than "loss of good".&lt;ref name="Pereira2013p54"/&gt; God does not participate in evil, God is perfection, His creation is perfection, stated Augustine.&lt;ref name="Pereira2013p54"/&gt; According to the privation theory, it is the absence of the good, that explains sin and moral evil.&lt;ref name="Pereira2013p54"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jairzinho Lopes Pereira |title=Augustine of Hippo and Martin Luther on Original Sin and Justification of the Sinner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iVcAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |isbn=978-3-647-55063-3 |pages=54‚Äì55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view has been criticized as merely substituting definition, of evil with "loss of good", of "problem of evil and suffering" with the "problem of loss of good and suffering", but it neither addresses the issue from the theoretical point of view nor from the experiential point of view.&lt;ref name=pereira2013p56&gt;{{cite book|author=Jairzinho Lopes Pereira |title=Augustine of Hippo and Martin Luther on Original Sin and Justification of the Sinner |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iVcAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |isbn=978-3-647-55063-3 |page=56 with footnote 25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars who criticize the privation theory state that murder, rape, terror, pain and suffering are real life events for the victim, and cannot be denied as mere "lack of good".&lt;ref&gt;Todd C. Calder (2007), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20464387 Is the Privation Theory of Evil Dead?], American Philosophical Quarterly, Vol. 44, No. 4, pp. 371‚Äì81&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine, states Pereira, accepted suffering exists and was aware that the privation theory was not a solution to the problem of evil.&lt;ref name=pereira2013p56/&gt;

====Evil as illusory====
An alternative modern version of the privation theory is by [[Christian Science]], which asserts that evils such as suffering and disease only appear to be real, but in truth are illusions, and in reality evil does not exist.&lt;ref name="Millard J. Erickson 2007, page 445-446"&gt;Millard J. Erickson, Christian Theology, Second Edition, Baker Academic, 2007, pp. 445‚Äì46.&lt;/ref&gt; The theologists of Christian Science, states Stephen Gottschalk, posit that the Spirit is of infinite might, mortal human beings fail to grasp this and focus instead on evil and suffering that have no real existence as "a power, person or principle opposed to God".&lt;ref name= Gottschalkp65&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Gottschalk |title=Christian Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r-FYQv75w7kC |year=1978|publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-03718-2|pages=65‚Äì69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The illusion version of privation theory theodicy has been critiqued for denying the reality of crimes, wars, terror, sickness, injury, death, suffering and pain to the victim.&lt;ref name= Gottschalkp65/&gt; Further, adds Millard Erickson, the illusion argument merely shifts the problem to a new problem, as to why God would create this "illusion" of crimes, wars, terror, sickness, injury, death, suffering and pain; and why God does not stop this "illusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Millard J. Erickson|title=Christian Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Z5zBQAAQBAJ |year=1998|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=978-0-8010-2182-4 |pages=446‚Äì47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turning the tables===
A different approach to the problem of evil is to turn the tables by suggesting that any argument from evil is self-refuting, in that its conclusion would necessitate the falsity of one of its premises. One response‚Äîcalled the defensive response&lt;ref name=russell625/&gt;‚Äîhas been to assert the opposite, and to point out that the assertion "evil exists" implies an ethical standard against which moral value is determined, and then to argue that this standard implies the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis ''Mere Christianity'' Touchstone:New York, 1980 pp. 45‚Äì46&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard criticism of this view is that an argument from evil is not necessarily a presentation of the views of its proponent, but is instead intended to show how premises which the theist is inclined to believe lead him or her to the conclusion that God does not exist. A second criticism is that the existence of evil can be inferred from the suffering of its victims, rather than by the actions of the evil actor, so no "ethical standard" is implied.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Oppy (2006), ''Arguing about Gods'', pp. 17, 296. Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521863864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Howard-Snyder|title=The Evidential Argument from Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wDHCgAAQBAJ |year=2008|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-11409-8 |pages= 305‚Äì06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument was expounded upon by David Hume.&lt;ref name=russell625&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Russell| title=The Oxford Handbook of Hume|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IMLmCwAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-974284-4 |pages=625‚Äì32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hidden reasons===
A variant of above defenses is that the problem of evil is derived from probability judgments since they rest on the claim that, even after careful reflection, one can see no good reason for co-existence of God and of evil. The [[inference]] from this claim to the general statement that there exists unnecessary evil is [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] in nature and it is this inductive step that sets the evidential argument apart from the logical argument.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;

The hidden reasons defense asserts that there exists the logical possibility of hidden or unknown reasons for the existence of evil along with the existence of an almighty, all-knowing, all-benevolent, all-powerful God. Not knowing the reason does not necessarily mean that the reason does not exist.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt; This argument has been challenged with the assertion that the hidden reasons premise is as plausible as the premise that God does not exist or is not "an almighty, all-knowing, all-benevolent, all-powerful". Similarly, for every hidden argument that completely or partially justifies observed evils it is equally likely that there is a hidden argument that actually makes the observed evils worse than they appear without hidden arguments, or that the hidden reasons may result in additional contradictions.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frances2013p110"/&gt; As such, from an inductive viewpoint hidden arguments will neutralize one another.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;

A sub-variant of the "hidden reasons" defense is called the "PHOG"‚Äîprofoundly hidden outweighing goods‚Äîdefense.&lt;ref name="Frances2013p110"/&gt; The PHOG defense, states Bryan Frances, not only leaves the co-existence of God and human suffering unanswered, but raises questions about why animals and other life forms have to suffer from natural evil, or from abuse (animal slaughter, animal cruelty) by some human beings, where hidden moral lessons, hidden social good and such hidden reasons to reconcile God with the problem of evil do not apply.&lt;ref name="Frances2013p110"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryan Frances |title=Gratuitous Suffering and the Problem of Evil: A Comprehensive Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ngeIkSJnh4kC&amp;pg=PA110|date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-66295-6 |pages=110‚Äì23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Previous lives and karma===
The theory of [[karma]] refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/312474/karma Karma] Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of evil, in the context of karma, has been long discussed in Indian religions including Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, both in its theistic and non-theistic schools; for example, in Uttara Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ Sutras Book 2 Chapter 1;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (2005), in The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism (Editor: [[Gavin Flood]]), Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|0631215352}}, pp. 454‚Äì55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (1989), ‚Äò‚ÄòEvil, Divine Omnipotence and Human Freedom: Vedanta‚Äôs theology of Karma, Journal of Religion, Vol. 69, pp 530‚Äì48&lt;/ref&gt; the 8th-century arguments by Adi Sankara in ''Brahmasutrabhasya'' where he posits that God cannot reasonably be the cause of the world because there exists moral evil, inequality, cruelty and suffering in the world;&lt;ref name=bilimoria&gt;P.

Many Indian religions place greater emphasis on developing the karma principle for first cause and innate justice with Man as focus, rather than developing religious principles with the nature and powers of God and divine judgment as focus.&lt;ref&gt;B. Reichenbach (1998), Karma and the Problem of Evil, in Philosophy of Religion Toward a Global Perspective (Editor: G.E. Kessler), Wadsworth, {{ISBN|978-0534505493}}, pp. 248‚Äì55&lt;/ref&gt; Karma theory of Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism is not static, but dynamic wherein livings beings with intent or without intent, but with words and actions continuously create new karma, and it is this that they believe to be in part the source of good or evil in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuvraj Krishan |title=The Doctrine of Karma: Its Origin and Development in BrƒÅhma·πáical, Buddhist, and Jaina Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC |year=1997|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan |isbn=978-81-208-1233-8 |pages=17‚Äì20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These religions also believe that past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also contributes to either. Other scholars&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Sharma (1973), Theodicy and the doctrine of karma, ‚Äò‚ÄòMan‚Äô‚Äô, Vol. 8, No. 3, pp. 347‚Äì64&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that nontheistic Indian religious traditions do not assume an omnibenevolent creator, and some&lt;ref&gt;The Nyaya-Vaisesika school of Hinduism is one of the exceptions where the premise is similar to the Christian concept of an omnibenevolent, omnipotent creator&lt;/ref&gt; theistic schools do not define or characterize their god(s) as monotheistic Western religions do and the deities have colorful, complex personalities; the Indian deities are personal and cosmic facilitators, and in some schools conceptualized like Plato‚Äôs [[Demiurge]].&lt;ref name=bilimoria2013&gt;P.

===Pandeism===
[[Pandeism]] is a modern theory that unites deism and pantheism, and asserts that God created the universe but during creation became the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Deism#ref1042352 Deism], Encyclop√¶dia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; In pandeism, God is no superintending, heavenly power, capable of hourly intervention into earthly affairs. No longer existing "above," God ''cannot'' intervene from above and cannot be blamed for failing to do so. God, in pandeism, was omnipotent and omnibenevolent, but in the form of universe is no longer omnipotent, omnibenevolent.&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lane | first = William C. | date = January 2010 |title = Leibniz's Best World Claim Restructured | url = http://apq.press.illinois.edu/47/1/lane.html | journal = American Philosophical Journal | publisher = | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 57‚Äì84 |accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|76‚Äì77}}

Sociologist [[Walter Brueggemann]] says theodicy is "a constant concern of the entire Bible" and needs to "include the category of social evil as well as moral, natural (physical) and religious evil".&lt;ref name="Anthony J.Tambasco"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Tambasco|editor1-first=Anthony J.|title=The Bible on Suffering: Social and Political Implications|date=2001|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8091-4048-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}}  There is general agreement among Bible scholars that the Bible "does not admit of a singular perspective on evil. ...Instead we encounter a variety of perspectives...

Philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]] says that, as it stands in its classic form, the argument from evil is unanswerable, yet there may be contrary reasons for not reaching its conclusion that there is no God.&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, Richard. (1998). ''Providence and the Problem of Evil''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; These reasons are of three kinds: other strong reasons for affirming that there is a God; general reasons for doubting the force of the argument itself; and specific reasons for doubting the criteria of any of the argument's premises; "in other words, a theodicy."&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, Richard. (1998). ''Providence and the Problem of Evil''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 28‚Äì29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Christianity has responded with multiple traditional theodicies: the Punishment theodicy (Augustine), the Soul-making theodicy (Irenaeus), Process theodicy (Rabbi Harold Kushner), Cruciform theodicy (Moltmann), and the free-will defense (Plantinga) among them.&lt;ref name="Mark S.

There are, essentially, four representations of evil in the Bible: chaos, human sin, Satanic/demonic forces, and suffering.&lt;ref name="Mark S. M.

*Deuteronomy 30 and Hebrews 12 open the possibilities that suffering may be punishment, natural consequences, or God's loving discipline. 
*Genesis 4:1-8 and the first murder suggests much suffering is the result of certain people's choices. 
*Genesis 45 says God's redemptive power is stronger than suffering and can be used to further good purposes. 
*Luke 22:31-34 says resist the fear and despair that accompany suffering, instead remember/believe God has the power to help. 
*Job 40 says God is not like humans but wants a relationship with all of them, which requires some surrender to God and acceptance of suffering.
*Romans 8:18-30 sets present temporary suffering within the context of God's eternal purposes. 
*Hebrews 12:1-6 sets suffering within the concept of "soul-making" as do 2 Peter 1:5-8, James 1, and others. 
*Exodus 17:1-7 and the whole book of Job characterize suffering as testing and speak of God's right to test human loyalty. 
*2 Corinthians 4:7-12 says human weakness during suffering reveals God's strength and that it is part of the believer's calling to embrace suffering in solidarity with Christ. 
*2 Corinthians 1:3-7 says God is the comforter and that people learn how to better comfort others when they have personal experience of suffering.  
*The great hymn in Philippians 2, along with Colossians 1:24, combine to claim Christ redeems suffering itself.  Believers are invited to share in that by emulating his good thoughts, words and deeds. All New Testament teachings on suffering are all grounded in and circle back to the fall of mankind and the possible redemptive power to individuals of the cross.&lt;ref name="Brian Han Gregg"/&gt;{{rp|160,161}}

Jewish theodicy is experiencing extensive revision in light of the Holocaust while still asserting the difference between the human and divine perspective of evil.

God's condemnation of evil is subsequently believed to be executed and expressed in his created world; a judgement that is unstoppable due to God's all powerful will; a constant and eternal judgement that becomes announced and communicated to other people on [[Judgment Day]]. In this explanation, God's condemnation of evil is declared to be a good judgement.

====Irenaean theodicy====
[[Irenaean theodicy]], posited by [[Irenaeus]] (2nd century CE‚Äìc. 202), has been reformulated by [[John Hick]]. It holds that one cannot achieve moral goodness or love for God if there is no evil and suffering in the world. Evil is [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]-making and leads one to be truly moral and close to God. God created an [[epistemic]] distance (such that God is not immediately knowable) so that we may strive to know him and by doing so become truly good. Evil is a means to good for three main reasons:

# ''Means of knowledge'' ‚Äì Hunger leads to pain, and causes a desire to feed. Knowledge of pain prompts humans to seek to help others in pain.
# ''Character building'' ‚Äì Evil offers the opportunity to grow morally. "We would never learn the art of goodness in a world designed as a hedonistic paradise" (''Richard Swinburne'')
# ''Predictable environment'' ‚Äì The world runs to a series of natural laws. These are independent of any inhabitants of the universe. Natural Evil only occurs when these natural laws conflict with our own perceived needs. This is not immoral in any way

====Augustinian theodicy====
St [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354‚Äì430 CE) in his [[Augustinian theodicy]], as presented in John Hick's book ''Evil and the God of Love'', focuses on the Genesis story that essentially dictates that God created the world and that it was good; evil is merely a consequence of [[the fall of man]] (The story of the Garden of Eden where Adam and Eve disobeyed God and caused inherent sin for man). Augustine stated that [[natural evil]] (evil present in the natural world such as natural disasters etc.) is caused by fallen angels, whereas [[moral evil]] (evil caused by the will of human beings) is as a result of man having become estranged from God and choosing to deviate from his chosen path. Augustine argued that God could not have created evil in the world, as it was created good, and that all notions of evil are simply a deviation or privation of goodness. Evil cannot be a separate and unique substance. For example, Blindness is not a separate entity, but is merely a lack or privation of sight. Thus the Augustinian theodicist would argue that the problem of evil and suffering is void because God did not create evil; it was man who chose to deviate from the path of perfect goodness.

====St. Thomas Aquinas====
Saint Thomas systematized the Augustinian conception of evil, supplementing it with his own musings. Evil, according to St. Thomas, is a privation, or the absence of some good which belongs properly to the nature of the creature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://josephkenny.joyeurs.com/CDtexts/ContraGentiles3a.htm#7 ''Summa Contra Gentiles'' III c. 7]&lt;/ref&gt; There is therefore no positive source of evil, corresponding to the greater good, which is God;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1049.htm#article3|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The cause of evil (Prima Pars, Q. 49)|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; evil being not real but rational‚Äîi.e. it exists not as an objective fact, but as a subjective conception; things are evil not in themselves, but by reason of their relation to other things or persons. All realities are in themselves good; they produce bad results only incidentally; and consequently the ultimate cause of evil is fundamentally good, as well as the objects in which evil is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1049.htm#article1|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The cause of evil (Prima Pars, Q. 49)|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Luther and Calvin ====
{{main|Original sin}}
Both [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and [[John Calvin|Calvin]] explained evil as a consequence of the [[fall of man]] and the [[original sin]]. Calvin, however, held to the belief in [[predestination]] and omnipotence, the fall is part of God's plan. Luther saw evil and original sin as an inheritance from Adam and Eve, passed on to all mankind from their conception and bound the will of man to serving sin, which God's just nature allowed as consequence for their distrust, though God planned mankind's redemption through [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Bondage of the Will|last=Luther|first=Martin|publisher=|year=1525|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately humans may not be able to understand and explain this plan.&lt;ref&gt;The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition: From the Book of Job to Modern Genetics, Joseph F. Kelly, p. 94‚Äì96&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Liberal Christianity ====
Some modern [[liberal Christianity|liberal Christians]], including French Calvinist theologian Andr√© Gounelle and Pastor Marc Pernot of [[L'Oratoire du Louvre]], believe that God is not omnipotent, and that the Bible only describes God as "almighty" in passages concerning the [[End Times]].&lt;ref name="andregounelle.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andregounelle.fr/dieu/quelle-puissance-l-impossible-toute-puissance.php|title=Quelle puissance ?|website=andregounelle.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oratoiredulouvre.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oratoiredulouvre.fr/dictionnaire/puissant-tout-puissant.php|title=Puissant - Tout-Puissant - Oratoire du Louvre|first=|last=Stereoweb|date=1 July 2018|website=Oratoire du Louvre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christian Science====
{{see also|Christian Science#Evil}}
[[Christian Science]] views evil as having no ultimate reality and as being due to false beliefs, consciously or unconsciously held. Evils such as illness and death may be banished by correct understanding. This view has been questioned, aside from the general criticisms of the concept of evil as an illusion discussed earlier, since the presumably correct understanding by Christian Science members, including the founder, has not prevented illness and death.&lt;ref name="Millard J. Erickson 2007, page 445-446"/&gt; However, Christian Scientists believe that the many instances of spiritual healing (as recounted e.g. in the Christian Science periodicals and in the textbook Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy) are [[anecdotal evidence]] of the correctness of the teaching of the unreality of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Peel, 1987, Spiritual Healing in a Scientific Age, San Francisco, Harper and Row, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; According to one author, the denial by Christian Scientists that evil ultimately exists neatly solves the problem of evil; however, most people cannot accept that solution&lt;ref&gt;Ben Dupre, "The Problem of Evil," 50 Philosophy Ideas You Really Need to Know, London, Quercus, 2007, p. 166: "Denying that there is ultimately any such thing as evil, as advocated by Christian Scientists, solves the problem at a stroke, but such a remedy is too hard for most to swallow."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that [[Satan]] is the original cause of evil.&lt;ref&gt;"Why All Suffering Is Soon to End", ''The Watchtower'', 15 May 2007, p. 21, "For some, the obstacle [to believing in God] involves what is often called the ''problem of evil''. They feel that if God exists and is almighty and loving, the evil and suffering in the world cannot be explained. No God who tolerates evil could exist, they reason... Satan has surely proved adept at blinding human minds. ...God is not responsible for the wickedness so prevalent in the world." [emphasis added] [http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2007366]&lt;/ref&gt; Though once a perfect angel, Satan developed feelings of self-importance and craved worship, and eventually challenged God's right to rule. Satan caused [[Adam and Eve]] to disobey God, and humanity subsequently became participants in a challenge involving the competing claims of Jehovah and Satan to universal sovereignty.&lt;ref name="pentonsatan"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Penton | first = M.J. | title = Apocalypse Delayed | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 1997 | pages = 189‚Äì90 | isbn = 9780802079732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other angels who sided with Satan became [[demon]]s.

God's subsequent tolerance of evil is explained in part by the value of free will. But Jehovah's Witnesses also hold that this period of suffering is one of non-interference from God, which serves to demonstrate that [[Jehovah]]'s "right to rule" is both correct and in the best interests of all intelligent beings, settling the "issue of universal sovereignty". Further, it gives individual humans the opportunity to show their willingness to submit to God's rulership.

At some future time known to him, God will consider his right to universal sovereignty to have been settled for all time. The [[Justification (theology)|reconciliation of "faithful" humankind]] will have been accomplished through [[Christ]], and nonconforming humans and demons will have been destroyed. Thereafter, evil (any failure to submit to God's rulership) will be summarily executed.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Does God Allow Evil and Suffering?", ''The Watchtower'', 1 May 2011, p. 16, [http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011331]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/g201107/why-so-much-suffering/ "Why Is There So Much Suffering?", ''Awake'', July 2011, p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ====
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) introduces a concept similar to [[Problem of evil#Irenaean theodicy|Irenaean theodicy]], that experiencing evil is a necessary part of the development of the soul. Specifically, the laws of nature prevent an individual from fully comprehending or experiencing good without experiencing its opposite.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Mormon]], [[Second Book of Nephi|2 Nephi]] {{lds||2-ne|2|11|13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, Latter-day Saints do not regard [[fall of man|the fall]] of [[Adam and Eve (LDS Church)|Adam and Eve]] as a tragic, unplanned cancellation of an eternal paradise; rather they see it as an essential element of God's plan. By allowing opposition and temptations in mortality, God created an environment for people to learn, to develop their freedom to choose, and to appreciate and understand the light, with a comparison to darkness &lt;ref name="MyUser_Https:_December_27_2015c1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-4-freedom-to-choose?lang=eng |title=Gospel Principles Chapter 4: Freedom to Choose |newspaper= |date=  |author= |accessdate= 27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Doctrines of the Gospel, Student Manual |year= 2000 |chapter= Chapter 10: The Purpose of Earth Life |chapter-url= https://www.lds.org/manual/doctrines-of-the-gospel-student-manual/chapter-10-the-purpose-of-earth-life?lang=eng |publisher= [[Institute of Religion|Institutes of Religion]], [[Church Educational System]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a departure from the mainstream Christian definition of [[omnipotence]] and [[omniscience]], which Mormons believe was changed by post-apostolic theologians in the centuries after Christ. The writings of [[Justin Martyr]], [[Origen]], [[Augustine]], and others indicate a merging of Christian principles with Greek metaphysical philosophies such as [[Neoplatonism]], which described divinity as an [[divine simplicity|utterly simple]], immaterial, formless substance/essence ([[ousia]]) that was the absolute causality and creative source of all that existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Bickmore |first= Barry R. |authorlink= Barry R.

===Islam===
Islamic scholars in the medieval and modern era have tried to reconcile the problem of evil with the afterlife theodicy.&lt;ref name="Abu-Rabi2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MeriBacharach2006p772"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ayman Shihadeh | editor=Josef W.

Alternate theodicies in Islamic thought include the 11th-century Ibn Sina's denial of evil in a form similar to "privation theory" theodicy.&lt;ref name="Inati2000p171"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shams C.

{{See also|Holocaust theology}}
According to Jon Levenson, the writers of Hebrew Bible were well aware of evil as a theological problem, but he does not claim awareness of the problem of evil.&lt;ref name=hoffman17&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henning Graf Reventlow |author2=Yair Hoffman |title=The Problem of Evil and its Symbols in Jewish and Christian Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBQx7JmufUkC |year=2004|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-0-8264-0085-7 |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, according to Yair Hoffman, the ancient books of the Hebrew Bible do not show an awareness of the theological problem of evil, and even most later biblical scholars did not touch the question of the problem of evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henning Graf Reventlow |author2=Yair Hoffman |title=The Problem of Evil and its Symbols in Jewish and Christian Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBQx7JmufUkC |year=2004|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-0-8264-0085-7 |pages=16‚Äì18|quote=... nowhere in this book is there a comprehensive concept of evil as such, let alone awareness of a theological problem of evil. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest awareness of the problem of evil in Judaism tradition is evidenced in extra- and post-biblical sources such as early [[Apocrypha]] (secret texts by unknown authors, which were not considered mainstream at the time they were written).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henning Graf Reventlow |author2=Yair Hoffman |title=The Problem of Evil and its Symbols in Jewish and Christian Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBQx7JmufUkC |year=2004|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-0-8264-0085-7 |page=26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first systematic reflections on the problem of evil by Jewish philosophers is traceable only in the medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Robert Michael De Lange|author2=Miri Freud-Kandel |title=Modern Judaism: An Oxford Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bugTDAAAQBAJ |year=2005| publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-926287-8 |page=315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of evil gained renewed interest among Jewish scholars after the moral evil of the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="LangeKandel2005p31"/&gt; The all-powerful, all-compassionate, all-knowing monotheistic God presumably had the power to prevent the Holocaust, but he didn't.&lt;ref name="LangeKandel2005p31"/&gt; The Jewish thinkers have argued that either God did not care about the torture and suffering in the world He created‚Äîwhich means He is not omnibenevolent, or He did not know what was happening‚Äîwhich means He is not omniscient.&lt;ref name="LangeKandel2005p31"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Robert Michael De Lange|author2=Miri Freud-Kandel|title=Modern Judaism: An Oxford Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bugTDAAAQBAJ |year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-926287-8 |pages=314‚Äì15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The persecution of Jewish people was not a new phenomenon, and medieval Jewish thinkers had in abstract attempted to reconcile the logical version of the problem of evil.&lt;ref name="LangeKandel2005p31"/&gt; The Holocaust experience and other episodes of mass extermination such as the [[Gulag]] and the [[Killing Fields]] where millions of people experienced torture and died, however, brought into focus the visceral nature of the evidential version of the problem of evil.&lt;ref name="LangeKandel2005p31"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Francis Kelly |title=The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition: From the Book of Job to Modern Genetics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg2RJAIZ4k4C |year=2002|publisher=Liturgical Press |isbn=978-0-8146-5104-9 |pages=219‚Äì20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other religions==
===Ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt===
The [[ancient Egypt]]ian religion, according to {{proper name|Roland Enmarch}}, potentially absolved their gods from any blame for evil, and used a negative cosmology and the negative concept of human nature to explain evil.&lt;ref name=enmarch2&gt;Roland Enmarch (2008), [http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/viewFile.do?contentFileId=1700601 Theodicy], UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology, Editors: Dieleman and Wendrich&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the Pharaoh was seen as an agent of the gods and his actions as a king were aimed to prevent evil and curb evilness in human nature.&lt;ref name=enmarch2/&gt;

===Ancient Greek religion===
The gods in [[Ancient Greek religion]] were seen as superior, but shared similar traits with humans and often interacted with them.&lt;ref name=Homer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Homer|title=The Iliad|date=1990|publisher=Penguin Books|location=NewYork}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Greeks didn't believe in any "evil" gods, the Greeks still acknowledged the fact that evil was present in the world.&lt;ref name="Greek/Gods"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirby|first1=John|title=Gods and Goddesses|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=nysl_ce_colgul&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R7&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=2&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3035100157&amp;&amp;docId=GALE%7cCX3035100157&amp;docType=GALE|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gods often meddled in the affairs of men, and sometimes their actions consisted of bringing misery to people, for example gods would sometimes be a direct cause of death for people.&lt;ref name="Homer"/&gt; However, the Greeks did not consider the gods to be evil as a result of their actions, instead the answer for most situations in Greek mythology was the power of [[fate]].&lt;ref name=Fate&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bolle|first1=Kees|title=Fate|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=nysl_ce_colgul&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R12&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3424501004&amp;&amp;docId=GALE%7cCX3424501004&amp;docType=GALE|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fate is considered to be more powerful than the gods themselves and for this reason no one can escape it.&lt;ref name="Fate"/&gt; For this reason the Greeks recognized that unfortunate events were justifiable by the idea of fate.&lt;ref name="Fate"/&gt;

Later Greek and Roman theologians and philosophers discussed the problem of evil in depth. Starting at least with Plato, philosophers tended to reject or de-emphasize literal interpretations of mythology in favor of a more [[Pantheism|pantheistic]], [[natural theology]] based on reasoned arguments. In this framework, stories that seemed to impute dishonorable conduct to the gods were often simply dismissed as false, and as being nothing more than the "imagination of poets."  Greek and Roman thinkers continued to wrestle, however, with the problems of [[natural evil]] and of evil that we observe in our day-to-day experience.  Influential Roman writers such as [[De Natura Deorum|Cicero]] and [[De Providentia|Seneca]], drawing on earlier work by the Greek philosophers such as the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], developed many arguments in defense of the righteousness of the gods, and many of the answers they provided were later absorbed into Christian [[theodicy]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Buddhism===

Buddhism accepts that there is evil in the world, as well as [[Dukkha]] (suffering) that is caused by evil or because of natural causes (aging, disease, rebirth). The precepts and practices of Buddhism, such as [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[Noble Eightfold Path]] aim to empower a follower in gaining insights and liberation ([[nirvana]]) from the cycle of such suffering as well as rebirth.&lt;ref name=koslowski10/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Williams|author2=Anthony Tribe|author3=Alexander Wynne|title=Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BVvFBQAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-52087-7 |pages=30‚Äì52 |chapter=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some strands of Mahayana Buddhism developed a theory of [[Buddha-nature]] in texts such as the ''Tathagata-garbha Sutras'' composed in 3rd-century south India, which is very similar to the "soul, self" theory found in classical Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|pages=103‚Äì09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

The mainstream Buddhism, from its early days, did not need to address the theological problem of evil as it saw no need for a creator of the universe and asserted instead, like many Indian traditions, that the universe never had a beginning and all existence is an endless cycle of rebirths (samsara).&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p141"/&gt;

Further, [[Deity|deities]] in Hinduism are neither eternal nor omnipotent nor omniscient nor omnibenevolent. [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] are mortal and subject to [[samsara]].

For that would lead to the possibility of partiality and cruelty. For it can be reasonably concluded that God has passion and hatred like some ignoble persons... Hence there will be a nullification of God's nature of extreme purity, (unchangeability), etc., [...] And owing to infliction of misery and destruction on all creatures, God will be open to the charge of pitilessness and extreme cruelty, abhorred even by a villain.

A sub-tradition within the [[Vaishnavism]] school of Hinduism that is an exception is dualistic [[Dvaita]], founded by [[Madhvacharya]] in the 13th-century. This tradition posits a concept of God so similar to Christianity, that Christian missionaries in colonial India suggested that Madhvacharya was likely influenced by early Christians who migrated to India,&lt;ref name=skhk177&gt;Sabapathy Kulandran and Hendrik Kraemer (2004), Grace in Christianity and Hinduism, James Clarke, {{ISBN|978-0227172360}}, pp. 177‚Äì79&lt;/ref&gt; a theory that has been discredited by scholars.{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}{{Sfn|Sarma|2000|pp=19‚Äì21}} Madhvacharya was challenged by Hindu scholars on the problem of evil, given his dualistic ''Tattvavada'' theory that proposed God and living beings along with universe as separate realities. Madhvacharya asserted, ''Yathecchasi tatha kuru'', which Sharma translates and explains as "one has the right to choose between right and wrong, a choice each individual makes out of his own responsibility and his own risk".{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=361}} Madhva's reply does not address the problem of evil, state Dasti and Bryant, as to how can evil exist with that of a God who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buchta |editor=Matthew R.

We have explained Madhva's attitude to the allied problem of freedom and freewill, on the basis of the doctrine of natural selection of good or bad and of the tripartite classification of souls. It is not therefore necessary for Madhva to answer the question of the consistency of evil with Divine goodness.}} According to David Buchta, this does not address the problem of evil, because the omnipotent God "could change the system, but chooses not to" and thus sustains the evil in the world.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw/&gt; This view of self's agency of Madhvacharya was, states Buchta, an outlier in Vedanta school and Indian philosophies in general.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw/&gt;

===Epicurus===
[[Epicurus]] is generally credited with first expounding the problem of evil, and it is sometimes called the "[[Epicurean paradox]]", the "riddle of Epicurus", or the "Epicurus' [[trilemma]]":

===David Hume===
[[David Hume]]'s formulation of the problem of evil in ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Is he [God] willing to prevent evil, but not able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? whence then is evil?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hume, David |title=Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion |publisher=Project Gutenberg |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4583 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[God's] power we allow [is] infinite: Whatever he wills is executed: But neither man nor any other animal are happy: Therefore he does not will their happiness. His wisdom is infinite: He is never mistaken in choosing the means to any end: But the course of nature tends not to human or animal felicity: Therefore it is not established for that purpose. Through the whole compass of human knowledge, there are no inferences more certain and infallible than these. In what respect, then, do his benevolence and mercy resemble the benevolence and mercy of men?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Gottfried Leibniz===
[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Gottfried Leibniz]]

In his ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]]'', the [[scepticism|sceptic]] [[Pierre Bayle]] denied the goodness and omnipotence of God on account of the [[suffering]]s experienced in this earthly life. [[Gottfried Leibniz]] introduced the term theodicy in his 1710 work ''[[Essais de Th√©odic√©e sur la bont√© de Dieu, la libert√© de l'homme et l'origine du mal]]'' ("Theodicic Essays on the Benevolence of God, the Free will of man, and the Origin of Evil") which was directed mainly against Bayle. He argued that this is the [[best of all possible worlds]] that God could have created.

Imitating the example of Leibniz, other philosophers also called their treatises on the problem of evil theodicies. [[Voltaire]]'s popular novel ''[[Candide]]'' mocked Leibnizian optimism through the fictional tale of a naive youth.

=== Thomas Robert Malthus ===
The population and economic theorist [[Thomas Malthus]] stated in a 1798 essay that people with health problems or disease are not suffering, and should not viewed as such. Malthus argued, "Nothing can appear more consonant to our reason than that those beings which come out of the creative process of the world in lovely and beautiful forms should be crowned with immortality, while those which come out misshapen, those whose minds are not suited to a purer and happier state of existence, should perish and be condemned to mix again with their original clay. Eternal condemnation of this kind may be considered as a species of eternal punishment, and it is not wonderful that it should be represented, sometimes, under images of suffering."&lt;ref&gt;Malthus T.R. 1798. An essay on the principle of population. Oxford World's Classics reprint. p158&lt;/ref&gt;

Malthus believed in the Supreme Creator, considered suffering as justified, and suggested that God should be considered "as pursuing the creatures that had offended him with eternal hate and torture, instead of merely condemning to their original insensibility those beings that, by the operation of general laws, had not been formed with qualities suited to a purer state of happiness."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Malthus (1798), [http://www.esp.org/books/malthus/population/malthus.pdf An essay on the principle of population], Oxford Classics, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
[[Immanuel Kant]] wrote an essay on theodicy.&lt;ref name=dembski11&gt;[http://www.designinference.com/documents/2003.04.CTNS_theodicy.pdf Making the Task of Theodicy Impossible?], William Dembski (2003), Baylor University, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested, states William Dembski, that any successful theodicy must prove one of three things: [1] what one deems contrary to the purposefulness of world is not so; [2] if one deems it is contrary, then one must consider it not as a positive fact, but inevitable consequence of the nature of things; [3] if one accepts that it is a positive fact, then one must posit that it is not the work of God, but of some other beings such as man or superior spirits, good or evil.&lt;ref name=dembski11/&gt;

Kant did not attempt or exhaust all theodicies to help address the problem of evil. He claimed there is a reason all possible theodicies must fail.&lt;ref&gt;See Kant's essay, "Concerning the Possibility of a Theodicy and the Failure of All Previous Philosophical Attempts in the Field" (1791). Stephen Palmquist explains why Kant refuses to solve the problem of evil in "Faith in the Face of Evil", Appendix VI of [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp2 Kant's Critical Religion] (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; While a successful philosophical theodicy has not been achieved in his time, added Kant, there is no basis for a successful anti-theodicy either.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designinference.com/documents/2003.04.CTNS_theodicy.pdf Making the Task of Theodicy Impossible?], William Dembski (2003), Baylor University, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

The Evil-God Challenge. Religious Studies 46 (3): 353‚Äì73&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that just as there exists a problem of evil for theists who believe in an omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent being, so too is there a problem of good for anyone who believes in an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnimalevolent (or perfectly evil) being. As it appears that the defenses and theodicies which might allow the theist to resist the problem of evil can be inverted and used to defend belief in the omnimalevolent being, this suggests that we should draw similar conclusions about the success of these defensive strategies. In that case, the theist appears to face a dilemma: either to accept that both sets of responses are equally bad, and so that the theist does not have an adequate response to the problem of evil; or to accept that both sets of responses are equally good, and so to commit to the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnimalevolent being as plausible.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Critics have noted that theodicies and defenses are often addressed to the logical problem of evil. As such, they are intended only to demonstrate that it is ''possible'' that evil can co-exist with an omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent being. Since the relevant parallel commitment is only that good can co-exist with an omniscient, omnipotent and omnimalevolent being, not that it is plausible that they should do so, the theist who is responding to the problem of evil need not be committing himself to something he is likely to think is false.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3327697 Cacodaemony and Devilish Isomorphism], King-Farlow, J. (1978), Cacodaemony and Devilish Isomorphism, Analysis, Vol. 38, No. 1, pp. 59‚Äì61.&lt;/ref&gt; This reply, however, leaves the evidential problem of evil untouched.

===Morality===
Another general criticism is that though a theodicy may harmonize God with the existence of evil, it does so at the cost of nullifying morality. This is because most theodicies assume that whatever evil there is exists because it is required for the sake of some greater good. But if an evil is necessary because it secures a greater good, then it appears we humans have no duty to prevent it, for in doing so we would also prevent the greater good for which the evil is required. Even worse, it seems that any action can be rationalized, as if one succeeds in performing it, then God has permitted it, and so it must be for the greater good. From this line of thought one may conclude that, as these conclusions violate our basic moral intuitions, no greater good theodicy is true, and God does not exist. Alternatively, one may point out that greater good theodicies lead us to see every conceivable state of affairs as compatible with the existence of God, and in that case the notion of God's goodness is rendered meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Dittman, Volker and Tremblay, Fran√ßois {{cite web|title=The Immorality of Theodicies

The prevalence of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] in the [[Dominican Republic]] is estimated to be 0.7 percent, [[List of countries by HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate|which is relatively low by Caribbean standards]]. However, the percentage among sex workers is estimated to be much higher, ranging from 2.5% to 12.4%, depending on the locale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/313/5786/474|title= The Sun.

==Sex Trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in the Dominican Republic}}
According to the US Department of State, the Dominican Republic is a source, transit and destination country for [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/pages/attachments/2017/07/05/dos_trafficking_full_2017.pdf|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=12 December 2017|date=2017}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women and children from neighbouring [[Haiti]], the rest of the [[Caribbean]], [[Asia]], and [[South America]] are trafficked into the country for [[Forced prostitution]].&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt; Colombian and Venezuelan women who had been brought into the country to dance in [[strip clubs]] are forced to work in prostitution.

Dominican women and children are subjected to sex trafficking within the country, neighbouring [[Haiti]], the rest of the Caribbean, [[Europe]], South and [[Central America]], the [[Middle East]], Asia and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

After the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], many Dominican prostitutes crossed over the border into Haiti, searching out clients amongst the aid workers and [[UN]] personnel.&lt;ref name="jezebel"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carmon|first1=Irin|title=Dominican Prostitutes In Haiti: Prized For Their Light Skin, Patronized By Peacekeepers|url=https://jezebel.com/5602386/dominican-prostitutes-in-haiti-prized-for-their-light-skin-patronized-by-peacekeepers|website=Jezebel|accessdate=13 December 2017|date=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominican women are paid a premium because of their lighter skin.&lt;ref name="jezebel"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carmon|first1=Irin|title=Dominican Prostitutes In Haiti: Prized For Their Light Skin, Patronized By Peacekeepers|url=https://jezebel.com/5602386/dominican-prostitutes-in-haiti-prized-for-their-light-skin-patronized-by-peacekeepers|website=Jezebel|accessdate=13 December 2017|date=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks the Dominican Republic as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dominican Republic 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282646.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest''''' is a [[2003 in literature|2003]] work by [[Ethnohistory|ethnohistorian]] [[Matthew Restall]] in which he posits that there are seven myths about the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] that have come to be widely believed to be true. Working within the tradition of [[New Philology]], Restall questions several notions which he claims are widely held myths about how the Spanish achieved military and [[cultural hegemony]] in [[Latin America]]. The book grew from undergraduate lectures at Penn State University; the "book's seven-part structure seemed justified by the fact that the number seven has deep roots and symbolic significance in the history of the Americas, both Native American and Spanish."&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Restall, ''Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest'', Oxford University Press 2003, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been published in Spanish and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] translations.

==Chapters==

*Chapter 1 deals with what Restall calls "''the Myth of exceptional men''" &amp;mdash; the idea that the Spanish Conquest was enabled by certain outstanding individuals such as [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]], [[Hern√°n Cort√©s|Cort√©s]], and [[Francisco Pizarro|Pizarro]] and their personal courage and innovative strategies. Restall shows that instead, the techniques of conquest and colonization used by the early Spanish explorers had been developed throughout at least a century of colonial expansion by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]] and were in fact mostly standard procedure. Restall draws on scholars' published work for this conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart and Stuart Schwartz, ''Early Latin America'', New York: Cambridge University Press 1983, pp. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;  
*Chapter 2 deals with what Restall calls "''the Myth of the King's Army''" &amp;mdash; the belief that the Spanish conquest was undertaken at the behest of the King of Spain and that the conquistadors were Spanish soldiers. Restall claims that in fact the conquistadors did not necessarily see themselves as Spanish but rather identified as Andalusians, Castilians, Aragonese, Basque, Portuguese, Galician, and even Genoese, Flemish, Greek, and Pardo (half-black). Nor were they acting under the command of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] who was also the king of the Spanish realms. And they were not soldiers in a formal military sense of the word but rather a group of feudal lords with their respective footmen, servants, pages, and mercenaries.
*Chapter 3 deals with what Restall calls "''the Myth of the White Conquistador''" &amp;mdash; the belief that the Spanish conquest was accomplished by a small number of white Spaniards. Restall claims that much of the actual military operations was undertaken by the indigenous allies of the Conquistadors, outnumbering the actual Spanish forces by many hundreds to one. He also shows that there were several conquistadors of African and Moorish descent &amp;mdash; dispelling the idea of the conquest as a victory of the "white Europeans" over the "red Indians".
*Chapter 4 deals with what Restall calls "''the Myth of Completion''" &amp;mdash; the belief that all of the Americas were under Spanish control within a few years after the initial contact. Restall claims that contrary to this belief pockets of indigenous peoples living without having been conquered subsisted for several centuries after the conquest - and arguably to this day. For example, [[Nojpet√©n|Tayasal]], the last independent city of the Maya, did not fall under Spanish sway until 1697. In other areas of Latin America, Spanish control was never complete and rebellions were continuous. He shows that the colonization of the Americas did not happen as one fell swoop, but rather as a historical process starting centuries before the magic years of 1492 and 1521 and ending several centuries after.
*Chapter 5 deals with what Restall calls "''The Myth of (Mis)Communication''" &amp;mdash; the beliefs that the Spaniards and natives had perfect communication and that each group understood the other's words and intentions unhindered, or alternatively that many of the crucial events of the conquest were a result of the two groups misunderstanding each other's intentions. Restall claims how communication between the groups were in fact very difficult at first, and that the rendering of passages of speech made by one group to the other in post-conquest sources cannot be understood as having been recorded "verbatim" even though it is understood and interpreted that way. But he also shows that the natives cannot be said to have crucially misunderstood or misinterpreted the Spaniards' intentions, but rather that they had a good understanding of how the Spanish worked at a very early stage in the conquest.
*Chapter 6 deals with what Restall calls "''The Myth of Native Desolation''" &amp;mdash; the belief that the indigenous peoples of the Americas resigned to their fate, included themselves in the new European order and ceased to exist as ethnicities. He also argues that many of the indigenous peoples never felt "conquered" but rather that they had formed a partnership with a new power to both of their advantage - this for example was the case for most of the allied forces that helped Cort√©s defeat the [[Aztecs]].
*Chapter 7 deals with what Restall calls "''The Myth of Superiority''" &amp;mdash; the belief that the success of the Spanish conquest was due to either the supposed technological superiority of the Spaniards or a kind of inherent cultural superiority &amp;mdash; and that Spanish victory was therefore inevitable. Restall claims that such technological advantages as handguns, cannons, steel armor, horses, and dogs weren't of great consequence in the actual fighting since they were all in short supply, and that the Aztecs were not daunted by this new technology for long. He also refutes the notion that the Indians' lack of alphabetic writing constituted a major drawback. Nor were the Indians childlike, naive or cowardly in comparison with the Spanish such as many early Spanish sources have painted them. Restall argues that the factors behind the success of the conquistadors were mostly the devastating effect of European diseases for which the Indians had no resistance, the disunity between indigenous groups, some of which allied with the Spaniards early, the technological advantage of the steel sword, native battle practices that were not upheld by the Spaniards &amp;mdash; such as killing non-combatants and civilians, and most importantly the fact that the Indians were fighting on their own ground with their families and fields to care for, which made them quicker to compromise.

'''Showrunner''' is the 21st-century term for the leading [[executive producer]] of a Hollywood television series in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;D'Arminio, Aubry (October 10, 2016). "Gary Glasberg: 1966‚Äì2016", ''[[TV Guide]]''. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has since been adopted in the Canadian and British television industries. A showrunner typically has creative control of a television series production, through combining the responsibilities of the head [[Screenwriter|writer]], executive producer, and [[script editor]]. In films, [[film director|directors]] typically have creative control of a production, but in television, the showrunner outranks the [[television director|director]].&lt;ref name="DVSR"&gt;{{cite news |title=TV's showrunners outrank directors |url=https://variety.com/2008/scene/awards/tv-s-showrunners-outrank-directors-1117990670/ |work=Variety  |date= August 15, 2008| author=Janice Rhoshalle Littlejohn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Traditionally, the executive producer of a television program was the ''chief executive'', responsible for the show's creative direction and production. Over time, the title of executive producer was applied to a wider range of roles‚Äîfrom someone who arranges financing to an "angel" who holds the title as an [[honorific]] with no management duties in return for providing backing capital. The term ''showrunner'' was created to identify the producer who holds ultimate management and creative authority for the program. The blog and book ''Crafty Screenwriting'' defines a showrunner as "the person responsible for all creative aspects of the show and responsible only to the network (and production company, if it's not [their] production company). The boss. Usually a writer."&lt;ref name="crafty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://complicationsensue.blogspot.com/2005/08/tentative-glossary.html|title=TENTATIVE GLOSSARYComplications Ensue|publisher=|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' columnist Scott Collins describes showrunners as:&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;[http://www.calendarlive.com/tv/cl-et-channel23nov23,0,5609336.story "Showrunners run the show"], "Channel Island" column, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 23 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"Hyphenates", a curious hybrid of starry-eyed artists and tough-as-nails [[Business operations|operational managers]]. They're not just writers; they're not just producers. They hire and fire writers and crew members, develop [[Plot (narrative)|story lines]], write scripts, cast actors, mind budgets and run interference with studio and network bosses. It's one of the most unusual and demanding, [[Lateralization of brain function|right-brain/left-brain]] job descriptions in the entertainment world....[S]howrunners make ‚Äì and often create ‚Äì the show and now more than ever, shows are the only things that matter. In the "[[long tail]]" entertainment economy, viewers don't watch networks. They don't even care about networks. They watch shows. And they don't care how they get them.}}

[[Shane Brennan]], the showrunner for ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' and ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'', states in an interview that:

{{quote|... the moniker was created to identify the producer who actually held ultimate management and creative authority for the program, given the way the honorific "executive producer" was applied to a wider range of roles. There's also the fact that anyone with any power wanted a producer's credit, including the leading actors, who often did no more than say the writers' lines. "It had got to the stage where it was incredibly confusing; there were so many production credits no one knew who was responsible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blundell|first=Graeme|title=Getting the run of the place|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/getting-the-run-of-the-place/story-e6frg8n6-1226041663244|accessdate=May 28, 2011|newspaper=The Australian|date=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Often the showrunner is the creator or co-creator of the series, but they often move on and day-to-day responsibilities of the position fall to other writers or writing teams. ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[The West Wing]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', ''[[NYPD Blue]]'', ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' and ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' are all examples of long-running shows that had successive, multiple showrunners.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==Canada==
The [[Writers Guild of Canada]], the union representing screenwriters in Canada, established the Showrunner Award in 2007, at the annual [[Canadian Screenwriting Awards]]. The first Showrunner Award was presented in April 2007 to [[Brad Wright]], executive producer of ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' and ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''.&lt;ref name="wright-award"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wgc.ca/cscs_awards/past_awards/csa_2007.html|title=2007 Canadian Screenwriting Awards|accessdate=2008-07-11|publisher=Writers Guild of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the first decade of the 21st century, the concept of a ''showrunner'', specifically interpreted as a writer or presenter with overall responsibility for a television production, began to spread to the [[television in the United Kingdom|British television industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=
Britain's got talent ‚Äì and it's untouchable |first=Mark |last=Lawson |authorlink=Mark Lawson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/22/mondaymediasection2 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=October 22, 2007 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first British comedy series to use the term was ''[[My Family]]'' (2000‚Äì11), which had several showrunners in succession. Initially, the show was overseen by creator [[Fred Barron (producer)|Fred Barron]] from series 1‚Äì4. Ian Brown and James Hendrie took over for series 5, followed by American writer [[Tom Leopold]] for series 6. Former ''[[Cheers]]'' showrunner Tom Anderson was in charge from series 7 to the final series, series 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/my_family/trivia/|title=My Family|work=comedy.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first writer appointed the role of showrunner on a British primetime drama was [[Tony McHale]], writer and creator of ''[[Holby City]]'', in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Holby City exec producer to leave |first=John |last=Plunkett |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/dec/14/hoby-city-exec-producer-leave |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=December 14, 2009 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jed Mercurio]] had carried out a similar role on the less conspicuous medical drama ''[[Bodies (TV series)|Bodies]]'' (2004‚Äì2006).&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Maggie|title=Line of Duty's Jed Mercurio|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/feb/09/line-of-duty-jed-mercurio|date=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But [[Russell T Davies]]' work on the 2005 revival of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' brought the term to prominence in [[British television]] (to the extent that in 2009 a writer for ''The Guardian'' wrote that "Over here, the concept of 'showrunner' has only made it as far as ''Doctor Who''").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Is ''Heroes'' lost without its superman? |first=Dan |last=Martin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/jun/24/television-science-fiction |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=June 24, 2009 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Davies said that he felt the role of the showrunner was to establish and maintain a consistent tone in a drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Davies |first=Russell T |subjectlink=Russell T Davies |interviewer=[[Mark Lawson]] |title=Mark Lawson Talks to... |publisher=[[BBC Four]] |date=January 16, 2008 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4GHxx1DOVg |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Doctor Who'' remains the most prominent example of a British television programme with a showrunner, with [[Steven Moffat]] having taken over the post from Davies from 2010 until 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/insight/paul_cornell_2.shtml |title=Paul Cornell interview |year=2008 |work=BBC Writersroom |publisher=BBC |accessdate=April 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124153013/http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/insight/paul_cornell_2.shtml |archivedate=January 24, 2011 |df=mdy-all }} Interviewer refers to ''Doctor Who'' as "...one of the few UK series with a showrunner".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Steven Moffat: The man with a monster of a job |first=Gareth |last=McLean |authorlink=Gareth McLean |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/mar/22/stephen-moffat-doctor-who |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=March 22, 2010 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Chibnall]] has since taken over from Moffat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/doctorwho/entries/55e94ef2-0282-494f-a62c-82bd514f02fe|title=Steven Moffat stands down and Chris Chibnall to take over|date=2016-01-23|website=Doctor Who|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been used to refer to other writer-producers, such as [[Tony Jordan]] on ''[[Moving Wallpaper]]'' and ''[[Echo Beach (soap)|Echo Beach]]'', Ann McManus on ''[[Waterloo Road (TV series)|Waterloo Road]]'', [[Adrian Hodges]] on ''[[Primeval (TV series)|Primeval]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Twice the drama at ITV |first=Jason |last=Deans |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/nov/20/broadcasting.ITV  |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=November 20, 2006 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news |title=Melodrama class |first=Peter |last=Wilby |authorlink=Peter Wilby |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/mar/03/ann-mc-manus-bbc-waterloo-road |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=March 3, 2009 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news |title=ITV1 saves Primeval from extinction after deal with digital channel Watch |first=Leigh |last=Holmwood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/sep/29/primeval-itv1-watch-deal-recommissioned |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 29, 2009 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jed Mercurio]] on ''[[Bodies (TV series)|Bodies]]'',&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; ''[[Line of Duty]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Curtis|first=Chris|title=Jed Mercurio: taking aim at the target culture|date=20 September 2012|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/in-depth/the-broadcast-interview/jed-mercurio-taking-aim-at-target-culture/5046826.article|publisher=Broadcastnow.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Critical (TV Series)|Critical]]''.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

'''Tenayuca''' ({{lang-nah|tenany≈çcƒÅn}}{{Pronunciation-needed}}) is a [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n archaeological site in the [[Valley of Mexico]]. In the Postclassic period of [[Mesoamerican chronology]], Tenayuca was a settlement on the former shoreline of the western arm of [[Lake Texcoco]]. It was located approximately {{convert|10|km}} to the northwest of [[Tenochtitlan]] (the heart of present-day [[Mexico City]]). 

Tenayuca is considered to be the earliest capital city of the [[Chichimec]], nomadic tribes who migrated and settled in the Valley of Mexico, where they formed their own kingdoms.&lt;ref name="INAH1"&gt;[http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/todas/htme/za00907.html Tenayuca at INAH] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090727105449/http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/todas/htme/za00907.html |date=2009-07-27 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Tenayuca means ''walled place'' in [[Nahuatl]].&lt;ref name="INAH1"/&gt;

==Location==
The pyramid of Tenayuca is located in [[San Bartolo Tenayuca]] in [[Tlalnepantla de Baz]], in [[Mexico State]].&lt;ref name="INAH1"/&gt; It falls within the urban sprawl of [[Greater Mexico City]].

==History==
By some historiographic traditions Tenayuca had been founded ca. 1224 by [[King Xolotl|Xolotl]], a semi-legendary ruler of a "[[Chichimec]]" tribe that had settled in the Valley of Mexico in the period some time after the 12th-century collapse of the former political hegemony in the Valley &amp;mdash; the so-called [[Toltec]] empire, emanating from [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]].&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt; Xolotl was succeeded by Nopaltzin who consolidated the Chichimec Kingdom . His son, Tlotzin, became lord of Tenayuca. When Nopaltzin died, his successor Quinatzin transferred the seat of Chichimec power to [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]], relegating Tenayuca to a site of secondary importance.&lt;ref name="INAH1"/&gt;
{{double image|right|Xiuhcoatl-tenayuca.jpg|180|Basin of Mexico 1519 map-en.svg|180|Left:''xiuhcoatl'' statue at Tenayuca, Aztec period Right:Location of Tenayuca in the basin of Mexico. Click to enlarge.}}
However archaeological remains recovered from Tenayuca indicate that the site had already been occupied in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]], long before this foundational event described in several of the [[Mesoamerican codices|Mesoamerican historical documents]]. Its population increased in the early Postclassic and continued to increase after the fall of Tula, when Tenayuca became an important regional power.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1982, 1990, p166.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 13th century A.D., some time after the arrival of the Chichimecs at Tenayuca, Tochintecuhtli,&lt;ref&gt;''Rabbit Lord'' in [[Nahuatl]]&lt;/ref&gt; the ruling lord of Tenayuca, allied himself with Huetzin, lord of the [[Acolhua]]s of [[Coatlich√°n]], and their alliance dominated the central Valley of Mexico, extending as far northeast as [[Tulancingo]]. By the mid 14th century the power of Tenayuca had already waned, it was conquered and replaced as a regional power by nearby [[Azcapotzalco (altepetl)|Azcapotzalco]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1982, 1990, p167.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1434, Tenochtitlan conquered Tenayuca, bringing it into the Aztec Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig 1988, p.152.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[Spanish Conquest]] Tenayuca was still occupied, and fighting took place there in 1520.&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt; The [[conquistador]] [[Bernal D√≠az del Castillo]] referred to Tenayuca as the "town of the serpents".&lt;ref name="Smith 1996, 2003, p.41"&gt;Smith 1996, 2003, p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point the site was abandoned. It was rediscovered during excavations made by Mexican archaeologists in 1925.&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt;

==Genesis of Aztec sacred architecture==
Aztec temple architecture primarily developed at Tenayuca, which has the earliest example yet found of the typical Aztec double pyramid, which consists of joined pyramidal bases supporting two temples.  After Tenayuca came under Aztec dominance, the Aztecs adopted this innovative style for the worship of their own deities.&lt;ref&gt;Matos Moctezuma 2002, p57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple of Tenayuca is better preserved than the similar temple of [[Tlatelolco (archaeological site)|Tlatelolco]] and its wall of serpents remains mostly intact on three sides of the base of the pyramid.&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;Kelly 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;92&amp;ndash;93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1982, 1990, p232.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site layout and description==
[[Image:Coatecpantli-tenayuca.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The base of the Aztec pyramid of Tenayuca &amp;mdash; adorned with a row of rattlesnake sculptures, known as ''coatepantli'' in [[Nahuatl]].]]
The site consists of a massive pyramidal platform with a double stairway rising on the western side to where the twin temples of [[Tlaloc]] and [[Huitzilopochtli]] once stood. The temple of Tlaloc occupied the northern part of the pyramid while the Huitzilopochtli temple stood to the south. Some of the temple steps are carved with year-glyphs such as knives, circles and shields.&lt;ref name="INAH1"/&gt; To the south of the stairway at ground level is a projecting platform bearing sculptures of crossed bones and projecting skulls.&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt;

Like many [[Mesoamerica]]n temples, various phases of construction were built one on top of the other. In the case of Tenayuca, the size of the building increased through six phases of construction but the basic form remained unchanged. The original double pyramid was enlarged five times, the first time probably in 1299 and then successively at 52-year intervals. The last phase of construction probably dates to 1507 and measures 62 meters wide by 50 meters deep. Aztec influence is apparent from the third stage in 1351, the following stages were purely Aztec in style, as demonstrated by the sloping tiers of the pyramid rather than the vertical walls apparent in the earlier stages.&lt;ref name="INAH1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt;

The pyramid base is surrounded by a ''coatepantli'' (Nahuatl for ''wall of serpents''), a low platform supporting 138 stone sculptures of snakes. Their bodies were once covered with plaster and painted in a variety of colours, with their scales painted black. On the north and south sides of the pyramid, at ground level, are two sculptures of coiled serpents . The crests on their heads bear markings representing the stars and identify them as ''Xiuhcoatl'' (the fire serpent). All the serpent sculptures around the pyramid were associated with fire and sun worship.&lt;ref name="INAH1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt;

There are several altars and shrines nearby that were also excavated, some of these also have serpent sculptures.&lt;ref name="Smith 1996, 2003, p.41"/&gt;

200 meters from the main pyramid of Tenayuca are the remains of what appear to have been an elite residential complex, with surviving plaster floors in some rooms. This area has been labelled Tenayuca II by archaeologists and appears to have gone through various phases of construction.&lt;ref name="INAH1"/&gt;

The pyramid of Tenayuca is in the care of the [[Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia]] (''National Institute of Anthropology and History'') and is open to the public.

'''York''' is a historic walled [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] in [[North Yorkshire]], England. At the confluence of the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]] and [[River Foss|Foss]], it is the traditional [[county town]] of the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Yorkshire]]. [[York Minster]] and a variety of cultural and sporting activities make it a popular tourist destination.

The city was founded by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]] as [[Eboracum]] in 71&amp;nbsp;AD. It became the capital of the Roman province of [[Britannia Inferior]], and later of the kingdoms of [[Northumbria]] and [[J√≥rv√≠k]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], York grew as a major wool trading centre and became the capital of the northern [[ecclesiastical province]] of the [[Church of England]], a role it has retained.&lt;ref name = "timeline"/&gt;

In the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, York became a hub of the railway network and a confectionery manufacturing centre. The economy of York is now dominated by services. The [[University of York]] and [[National Health Service]] are major employers, whilst tourism has become an important element of the local economy.

The City of York local government district includes rural areas beyond the old city boundaries. In 2011, it had a population of 198,051.&lt;ref name=UAStats /&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of York}}

=== Origin of the name ===
The word ''York'' (Old Norse: ''[[J√≥rv√≠k]]'') is derived from the [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] name ''EburƒÅkon'' ([[Latin (language)|Latinised]] variously as ''[[Eboracum]]'', ''Eburacum'' or ''Eburaci''),  a combination of ''eburos'' "yew-tree" (cf. Old Irish ''ibar'' "yew-tree", Welsh ''efwr'' "alder buckthorn", Breton ''evor'' "alder buckthorn") and a suffix of [[appurtenance]] ''*-ƒÅko(n)'' "belonging to-, place of-" (cf. Welsh ''-og'')&lt;ref name="Xavier Delamarre 2003, p. 159"&gt;Xavier Delamarre, ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'', √©ditions errance 2003, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning either "place of the [[Taxus baccata|yew]] trees" (cf. ''efrog'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], ''eabhrac'' in [[Irish Gaelic]] and ''eabhraig'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]], by which names the city is known in those languages); or alternately, "the settlement of (a man named) ''Eburos''" (a [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] personal name is mentioned in different documents as ''EŒ≤ŒøœÖœÅŒøœÇ'', ''Eburus'' and ''Eburius'' and, when combined with the Celtic possessive suffix ''*-ƒÅko(n)'', could be used to denote his property).&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Yves Lambert, ''La langue gauloise'', √©ditions errance 1994, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Xavier Delamarre 2003, p. 159"/&gt; 

The name ''Eboracum'' became the [[Angles|Anglian]] ''Eoforwic'' in the 7th&amp;nbsp;century: a compound of ''Eofor-'', from the old name, and ''-wic'' a village probably by conflation of the element ''Ebor-'' with a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] root ''*eburaz'' (boar); by the 7th&amp;nbsp;century the [[Old English]] for 'boar' had become ''eofor''. When the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] army conquered the city in 866, its name became ''J√≥rv√≠k''.&lt;ref name=coyyh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.york.gov.uk/leisure/Local_history_and_heritage/yorks_history/ |title=York's history |publisher=City of York Council |date=20 December 2006 |accessdate=1 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031235552/http://www.york.gov.uk/leisure/Local_history_and_heritage/yorks_history/ |archivedate=31 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Old French]] and [[Norman language|Norman]] name of the city following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] was recorded as "Everwic" (modern Norman "√âv√®roui") in works such as Wace's [[Roman de Rou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wace|first1=Robert|title=Le Roman de Rou et des ducs de Normandie|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65499509/f362|website=BnF Gallica|accessdate=15 September 2016|page=362|quote="Li Barunz de Everwic Schire (the barons of Yorkshire)"}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''J√≥rv√≠k'', meanwhile, gradually reduced to ''York'' in the centuries after the Conquest, moving from the [[Middle English]] ''Yerk'' in the 14th&amp;nbsp;century through ''Yourke'' in the 16th&amp;nbsp;century to ''Yarke'' in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century. The form ''York'' was first recorded in the 13th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.visityork.org/information/timeline.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108205146/http://www.visityork.org/information/timeline.asp|archivedate=8 January 2008|publisher=York Tourism Bureau|work=Visit York|title=Timeline|year=2005|accessdate=25 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Willis35&gt;{{cite book | last = Willis | first = Ronald | year = 1988 | title = The illustrated portrait of York | edition = 4th | publisher = Robert Hale Limited | isbn = 0-7090-3468-7 | page = 35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many company and place names, such as the Ebor race meeting, refer to the Latinised Brittonic, Roman name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkfestivals.com/metadot/index.pl?iid=2757&amp;isa=Category |title=Ebor Festival |publisher=York City of Festivals |accessdate=17 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718142734/http://www.yorkfestivals.com/metadot/index.pl?iid=2757&amp;isa=Category |archivedate=18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12th&amp;#8209;century chronicler [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], in his fictional account of the prehistoric kings of Britain, ''{{lang|la|[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]}}'', suggests the name derives from that of a pre-Roman city founded by the legendary king [[Ebraucus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_the_Kings_of_Britain/Book_2#7|title=Geoffrey of Monmouth, ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' (1136) ‚Äì online at Wikisource |date= |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Archbishop of York]] uses ''Ebor'' as his surname in his signature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-of-address/professions/religion/church-of-england/archbishops-of-canterbury-and-york.aspx |title=How to address the Archbishops of Canterbury and York ‚Äì Forms of Address, Church of England, Religion |publisher=Debretts.com |date= |accessdate=4 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121101106/http://www.debretts.com/forms-of-address/professions/religion/church-of-england/archbishops-of-canterbury-and-york.aspx |archivedate=21 January 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
[[File:Roman Fortifications in Museum Gardens York.jpg|thumb|left|Roman wall and the west corner tower of [[Eboracum]]. The top half is medieval.]]
Archaeological evidence suggests that [[Mesolithic]] people settled in the region of York between 8000 and 7000&amp;nbsp;BC, although it is not known whether their settlements were permanent or temporary. By the time of the [[Roman conquest of Britain]], the area was occupied by a [[tribe]] known to the Romans as the [[Brigantes]]. The Brigantian tribal area initially became a Roman client state, but later its leaders became more hostile and the Roman [[Legio IX Hispana|Ninth Legion]] was sent north of the [[Humber]] into Brigantian territory.&lt;ref name=Willis26&gt;{{cite book | last = Willis | first = Ronald | year = 1988 | title = The illustrated portrait of York | edition = 4th | publisher = Robert Hale Limited | isbn = 0-7090-3468-7 | pages = 26‚Äì27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was founded in 71&amp;nbsp;AD, when the Ninth Legion conquered the Brigantes and constructed a wooden military [[castra|fortress]] on flat ground above the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]] close to its [[confluence]] with the [[River Foss]]. The fortress, whose walls were rebuilt in stone by the VI legion based there subsequent to the IX legion, covered an area of {{convert|50|acre|ha}} and was inhabited by 6,000 [[Roman legion|legion]]ary soldiers. The site of the ''principia'' (HQ) of the fortress lies under the foundations of [[York Minster]], and excavations in the undercroft have revealed part of the Roman structure and columns.&lt;ref name = coyyh/&gt;&lt;ref name = ytss-2/&gt;

[[File:Constantine York.jpg|thumb|[[Statue of Constantine the Great, York|Roman Emperor Constantine the Great proclaimed Emperor at York in 306&amp;nbsp;AD]].|upright=0.85]]
The Emperors [[Hadrian]], [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Constantius I]] all held court in York during their various campaigns. During his stay 207‚Äì211&amp;nbsp;AD, the Emperor Severus proclaimed York capital of the province of Britannia Inferior, and it is likely that it was he who granted York the privileges of a '[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]' or city. Constantius I died in 306&amp;nbsp;AD during his stay in York, and his son [[Constantine the Great]] was proclaimed Emperor by the troops based in the fortress.&lt;ref name=ytss-2&gt;{{cite book | last = Shannon | first = John | last2 = Tilbrook |first2 = Richard | title = York ‚Äì the second city | publisher = Jarrold Publishing | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-7117-0507-0 | page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Lower (Britannia Inferior) and Upper Britain (Britannia Superior)|url = http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/Classics/roman_provinces/britain/image21.htm| publisher= Vanderbilt University|accessdate=24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 314&amp;nbsp;AD a bishop from York attended the [[Synod of Arles (314)|Council at Arles]] to represent Christians from the [[Roman province|province]].

While the Roman ''colonia'' and [[castra|fortress]] were located on high ground, by 400&amp;nbsp;AD the town was victim to occasional flooding from the Rivers Ouse and Foss, and the population reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Russo | first=Daniel G. | year=1998 | title=Town Origins and Development in Early England, c. 400‚Äì950 A.D. | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | publicationdate=1998 | pages=119‚Äì120 | isbn=978-0-313-30079-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; York declined in the [[sub-Roman Britain|post-Roman]] era, and was taken and settled by the [[Angles]] in the 5th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Jones | first1=Barri |last2=Mattingly | first2=David | year=1990 | title=An Atlas of Roman Britain | publisher=Blackwell Publishers | publicationdate=2007 | publication-place=Cambridge | page=317 | isbn=978-1-84217-067-0}} Cemeteries that are identifiably Anglian date from this period; some graves are within the Roman cemetery on The Mount.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reclamation of parts of the town was initiated in the 7th&amp;nbsp;century under [[Edwin of Northumbria|King Edwin]] of [[Northumbria]], and York became his chief city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = York history timeline | url = http://www.yorkhistory.com/timeline/index.php | publisher = YorkHistory.com | year = 2007 | accessdate = 4 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070314135055/http://www.yorkhistory.com/timeline/index.php |archivedate = 14 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first wooden  [[minster (church)|minster church]] was built in York for the baptism of Edwin in 627, according to the Venerable Bede.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Edwin ordered the small wooden church be rebuilt in stone; however, he was killed in 633, and the task of completing the stone minster fell to his successor [[Oswald of Northumbria|Oswald]].&lt;ref name=coyyh/&gt;&lt;ref name = ymhist/&gt; In the following century, [[Alcuin of York]] came to the cathedral school of York.

In 866, Northumbria was in the midst of internecine struggles when the [[Vikings]] raided and captured York. Under Viking rule the city became a major river port, part of the extensive Viking trading routes throughout northern Europe. The last ruler of an independent J√≥rv√≠k, [[Eric Bloodaxe]], was driven from the city in 954&amp;nbsp;AD by King [[Eadred]] in his successful attempt to complete the unification of England.&lt;ref name=coyyjv&gt;{{cite web|title=Jorvik: Viking York |publisher=City of York Council |url=http://www.york.gov.uk/leisure/Local_history_and_heritage/yorks_history/03_jorvik/ |date=20 December 2006 |accessdate=5 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913081501/http://www.york.gov.uk/leisure/Local_history_and_heritage/yorks_history/03_jorvik/ |archivedate=13 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the conquest===
[[File:RidsdalePanorma.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|A panorama of 15th-century York by [[E Ridsdale Tate]], [[York Castle]] is on the right hand side of the river, opposite the abandoned motte of [[Baile Hill, York|Baile Hill]]]]

In 1068, two years after the [[Norman conquest of England]], the people of York rebelled. Initially they were successful, but upon the arrival of [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] the rebellion was put down. William at once built a wooden fortress on a motte. In 1069, after another rebellion, the king built another timbered castle across the River Ouse. These were destroyed in 1069 and rebuilt by William about the time of his ravaging Northumbria in what is called the "[[Harrying of the North]]" where he destroyed everything from York to Durham. The remains of the rebuilt castles, now in stone, are visible on either side of the River Ouse. See Peter Rex's The English Resistance, The Underground War Against the Normans, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=York |volume=28 |pages=927‚Äì929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first stone minster church was badly damaged by fire in the uprising, and the Normans built a minster on a new site. Around the year 1080, [[Thomas I of York|Archbishop Thomas]] started building the cathedral that in time became the current Minster.&lt;ref name="ymhist"&gt;

In the 12th&amp;nbsp;century York started to prosper. In 1190, [[York Castle#12th century|York Castle]] was the site of an infamous [[12th century English pogroms|massacre]] of its [[Jew]]ish inhabitants, in which at least 150 Jews died (although some authorities put the figure as high as 500).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.historyofyork.org.uk/themes/norman/the-1190-massacre | title=The 1190 Massacre | publisher=York Museums Trust | work=History Of York | accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcpog&gt;{{cite web

York became a major cloth manufacturing and trading centre. [[Edward I]] further stimulated the city's economy by using the city as a base for his war in Scotland. The city was the location of significant unrest during the so-called [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381. The city acquired an increasing degree of autonomy from central government including the privileges granted by a charter of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] in 1396.

===16th to 18th centuries===
[[File:Wall of the ruins, st marys abbey York 8714.jpg|thumb|A portion of the ruins of [[St Mary's Abbey, York]], founded in 1155, extensively damaged by fire in 1157, rebuilt by 1294 and destroyed during the Dissolution in the 16th century]]

The city underwent a period of economic decline during [[Tudor period|Tudor]] times. Under [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]], the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] saw the end of York's many [[Monastery|monastic houses]], including several orders of [[friars]], the hospitals of St Nicholas and of St Leonard, the largest such institution in the north of England. This led to the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]], an uprising of northern Catholics in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire opposed to religious reform. Henry VIII restored his authority by establishing  the [[Council of the North]] in York in the dissolved St Mary's Abbey. The city became a trading and service centre during this period.&lt;ref name=coyad&gt;{{cite web|title=The Age of Decline |publisher=City of York Council |url=http://www.york.gov.uk/leisure/Local_history_and_heritage/yorks_history/05_the_age_of_decline/ |date=20 December 2006 |accessdate=5 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204082654/http://www.york.gov.uk/leisure/Local_history_and_heritage/yorks_history/05_the_age_of_decline/ |archivedate=4 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = iadbpm/&gt;

[[Guy Fawkes]], who was born and educated in York, was a member of a group of [[Roman Catholic]] restorationists that planned the [[Gunpowder Plot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thisweek-online.com/2005/September/30bonfire.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051215081802/http://www.thisweek-online.com/2005/September/30bonfire.html |archivedate=15 December 2005| publisher= ThisWeek Newspapers |work=ThisWeek Online |title=Transplanted Englishman brings country's Guy Fawkes party tradition to Burnsville |date=24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its aim was to displace [[Protestant]] rule by blowing up the [[Houses of Parliament]] while King [[James I of England|James I]], the entire Protestant, and even most of the Catholic [[aristocracy]] and [[nobility]] were inside.

In 1644, during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] [[Siege of York|besieged York]], and many medieval houses outside the city walls were lost. The [[barbican]] at Walmgate Bar was undermined and explosives laid, but, the plot was discovered. On the arrival of [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]], with an army of 15,000&amp;nbsp;men, the siege was lifted. The Parliamentarians retreated some {{convert|6|mi|km|0}} from York with Rupert in pursuit, before turning on his army and soundly defeating it at the [[Battle of Marston Moor]]. Of Rupert's 15,000&amp;nbsp;troops, no fewer than 4,000 were killed and 1,500 captured. The siege was renewed; the city could not hold out for much longer, and surrendered to [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Sir Thomas Fairfax]]&lt;ref name=coyad/&gt; on 15 July.

Following the [[English Restoration|restoration of the monarchy]] in 1660, and the removal of the garrison from York in 1688, the city was dominated by the gentry and merchants, although the clergy were still important. Competition from [[Leeds]] and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], together with silting of the River Ouse, resulted in York losing its pre-eminent position as a trading centre but the city's role as the social and cultural centre for wealthy northerners was on the rise. York's many elegant [[townhouse]]s, such as the [[Mansion House, York|Lord Mayor's Mansion House]] and [[Fairfax House]] date from this period, as do the [[York Assembly Rooms|Assembly Rooms]], the [[Theatre Royal, York|Theatre Royal]], and the [[York Racecourse|racecourse]].&lt;ref name=iadbpm&gt;{{cite web

York is the traditional [[county town]] of [[Yorkshire]], and therefore did not form part of any of its three historic [[Riding (division)|ridings]], or divisions. Its Mayor has had the status of Lord Mayor since 1370. York is an ancient [[borough]], and was reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]] to form a [[municipal borough]]. It gained the status of a [[county borough]] in 1889, under the [[Local Government Act 1888]], and existed so until 1974, when, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], it became a [[non-metropolitan district]] in the county of North Yorkshire, whilst retaining its Lord Mayor, its Sheriff and Aldermen.&lt;ref&gt;

From 1997 to 2010, the central part of the district was covered by the [[City of York (UK Parliament constituency)|City of York]] constituency, while the remainder was split between the constituencies of [[Ryedale (UK Parliament constituency)|Ryedale]], [[Selby (UK Parliament constituency)|Selby]], and [[Vale of York (UK Parliament constituency)|Vale of York]].&lt;ref&gt;

Following their review in 2003 of parliamentary representation in [[North Yorkshire]], the [[Boundary Commission for England]] recommended the creation of two new seats for the City of York, in time for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|general election in 2010]]. These are [[York Central (UK Parliament constituency)|York Central]], which covers the inner urban area, and is entirely surrounded by the [[York Outer (UK Parliament constituency)|York Outer]] constituency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boundarycommissionforengland.org.uk/review_areas/downloads/FR_NR_NYorks_York.doc |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091102211613/http://www.boundarycommissionforengland.org.uk/review_areas/downloads/FR_NR_NYorks_York.doc |dead-url=yes |archivedate=2 November 2009 |title=Final recommendations for Parliamentary constituencies in the County of North Yorkshire and the City of York |format=[[Microsoft Word|Microsoft Word document]] |publisher=Boundary Commission for England |date=5 November 2003 |accessdate=20 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceremonial governance===
York is within the ceremonial territorial jurisdiction of the [[Dukedom of York]] which is presently held by [[Prince Andrew]], the incumbent [[Duke of York]].

== Geography ==
{{Main|Areas of the City of York}}

=== Location ===
The city is {{Convert|21|mi|km|0}} from [[Leeds]].

York lies in the [[Vale of York]], a flat area of fertile arable land bordered by the [[Pennines]], the [[North York Moors]] and the [[Yorkshire Wolds]]. The city was built at the confluence of the Rivers Ouse and Foss on a terminal [[moraine]] left by the last [[Ice Age]].&lt;ref name=Hall-25&gt;

[[File:River Ouse and Lendal Bridge from Riverside Walkway - geograph.org.uk - 238516.jpg|right|thumb|The city's [[Lendal Bridge]] crosses the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|Ouse]]]]
During Roman times, the land surrounding the rivers Ouse and Foss was marshy, making the site easy to defend. The city is prone to flooding from the River Ouse, and has an extensive (and until 2015 mostly effective) network of flood defences with walls along the river, and a liftable barrier across the River Foss where it joins the Ouse at the 'Blue Bridge'. In October and November 2000, York experienced the worst flooding in 375 years; more than 300 homes were flooded.&lt;ref name=dmcbflood&gt;

===Architecture===

York is noted for its numerous churches and pubs. Most of the remaining churches in York are from the medieval period.

===Climate===
York has a [[temperate]] climate with four distinct seasons. As with the rest of the [[Vale of York]] the city's climate is drier and warmer than the rest of the [[Yorkshire and Humberside]] region. Owing to its lowland location, York is prone to frosts, fog, and cold winds during winter, spring and very early summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = England Rural Development Programme: Appendix A3 ‚Äì Yorkshire and The Humber Region ‚Äì Section 1 Description Of Current Situation In The Yorkshire And The Humber Region | pages = 2‚Äì3 | url=http://www.hull.ac.uk/coastalobs/media/pdf/appendixa3.pdf| format = PDF | publisher = East Yorkshire Coastal Observatory  | accessdate = 15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Snow can fall in winter from December onwards to as late as April but quickly melts. As with much of the British Isles, the weather is changeable. York experiences most sunshine from May to July, an average of six hours per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Average Conditions:York, United Kingdom |publisher=BBC |work=[[BBC Weather]] |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT003820/ |accessdate=24 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With its inland location, summers are often warmer than the Yorkshire coast with temperatures of 27¬∞C or more. Extremes recorded at the University of York campus between 1998 and 2010 include a highest temperature of {{convert|34.5|¬∞C|1}} (Monday 17 July 2006) and a lowest temperature of {{convert|-16.3|¬∞C|1}} (Monday 6 December 2010). The most rainfall in one day was {{convert|88.4|mm|in|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;

Between 1773 and 1777, the Grand Jury House was replaced by John Carr's elegant Court House for the [[Assizes]] of the whole county. The Female Prison was built opposite and mirrors the court building positioned around a circular lawn which became known as the "Eye of the Ridings", or the "Eye of York".

1776 saw the last recorded instance of a wife hanged and burnt for poisoning her husband. [[Horse theft]] was a [[capital offence]]. The culprits of lesser crimes were brought to court by the city constables and would face a fine. The corporation employed a "common informer" whose task was to bring criminals to justice.&lt;ref&gt;

==Transport==
York's location on the River Ouse and in the centre of the Vale of York means that it has always had a significant position in the nation's transport system.&lt;ref name = VCH/&gt; The city grew up as a river port at the confluence of the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]] and the [[River Foss]]. The Ouse was originally a [[tidal river]], accessible to seagoing ships of the time. Today both of these rivers remain navigable, although the Foss is only navigable for a short distance above the confluence. A [[canal lock|lock]] at [[Naburn]] on the Ouse to the south of York means that the river in York is no longer tidal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canalrivertrust.org.uk/canals-and-rivers/river-ouse|title=River Ouse|publisher=Canal &amp; River Trust|accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the end of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, the Ouse was used by [[barge]]s to carry freight between York and the port of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. The last significant such traffic was the supply of [[newsprint]] to the local newspaper's Foss-side print works, which continued until 1997. Today navigation is almost exclusively leisure-oriented.

{{wide image|York night.JPG|1000px|align-cap=center|Panorama of the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]] looking south from Lendal Bridge}}
Like most cities founded by the Romans, York is well served by long-distance trunk roads. The city lies at the intersection of the [[A19 road]] from [[Doncaster]] to [[Tyneside]], the [[A59 road]] from [[Liverpool]] to York, the [[A64 road]] from [[Leeds]] to [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], and the [[A1079 road]] from York to [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. The A64 road provides the principal link to the motorway network, linking York to both the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1(M)]] and the [[M1 motorway]]s at a distance of about {{convert|10|mi|km|round=5}} from the city. The transpennine [[M62 motorway]] is less than {{convert|20|mi|km|round=5}} away providing links to [[Manchester]] and Liverpool.

[[File:Stonegate in York - geograph.org.uk - 1261035.jpg|thumb|right|Stonegate is pedestrianised during the day]]
The city is surrounded on all sides by an outer ring road, at a distance of some {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} from the centre of the city, which allows through traffic to by-pass the city. The street plan of the historic core of the city dates from medieval times and is not suitable for modern traffic. As a consequence many of the routes inside the city walls are designated as [[Car-free zone|car free]] during business hours or restrict traffic entirely. To alleviate this situation, five bus based [[York Park and Ride|park and ride]] sites operate in York. The sites are located towards the edge of the urban area, with easy access from the ring road, and allow out of town visitors to complete their journey into the city centre by bus.&lt;ref name=coypar&gt;{{cite web|title=Park &amp; Ride |publisher=City of York Council |url=http://www.york.gov.uk/transport/Parking/Park_and_Ride/ |date=31 August 2007 |accessdate=9 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014003339/http://www.york.gov.uk/transport/Parking/Park_and_Ride/ |archivedate=14 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local Transport Plan 2006===
English local authorities are required to produce Local Transport Plans (LTPs), strategies for developing local integrated transport as part of a longer-term vision. LTPs are used by central government to allocate funding for transport schemes. The final Local Transport Plan 2006‚Äì2011 for York was submitted to central government in March 2006. The plan addresses the fact that traffic in York is predicted to grow considerably over the coming years. The key aims of the plan are to ease congestion and improve accessibility, air quality and safety. Major funding allocations earmarked for the first five years of the plan's life span include outer ring road improvements, improved management of the highway network, improvements to the bus network including park and ride services, provision of off-road walking and cycling routes, air quality improvements and safety measures.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[York Mystery Plays]] are performed in public at intervals, using texts based on the original medieval plays of this type that were performed by the guilds ‚Äì often with specific connections to the subject matter of each play. (For instance the Shipwrights' Play is the ''Building of Noah's Ark'' and the fish-sellers and mariners the ''Landing of Noah's Ark'').&lt;ref&gt;J S Purvis, ''The York Cycle of Mystery Plays,'' London S.P.C.K. 1957 repr.1962&lt;/ref&gt; The York Cycle of Mystery Plays or Pageants is the most complete in England. Originally performed from wagons at various locations around the city from the 14th century until 1570, they were revived in 1951 during the [[Festival of Britain]], when York was one of the cities with a regional festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.yorkmysteryplays.org/|title = NCEM Archive|accessdate = 26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They became part of the York City Festival every three years and later four years. They were mostly produced in a temporary open-air theatre within the ruins of St. Mary's Abbey, using some professional but mostly amateur actors. Lead actors have included [[Christopher Timothy]] and [[Robson Green]] (in the role of Christ) and Dame [[Judi Dench]] as a school girl, in 1951, 1954 and 1957. (She remains a Patron of the plays). The cycle was presented in the Theatre Royal in 1992 and 1996, within York Minster in 2000 and in 2002, 2006 and 2010 by Guild groups from wagons in the squares, in the Dean's Park, or at the Eye of York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://yorkmysteryplays.co.uk/|title = Guilds of York|accessdate = 26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They go around the streets, recreating the original productions.

Each September since 1997, York has held an annual Festival of Food and Drink. The aim of the festival is to spotlight food culture in York and North Yorkshire by promoting local food production. The Festival attracts up to 150,000 visitors over 10 days, from all over the country.&lt;ref&gt;

In the centre of York, in St Helen's Square, there is the York branch of [[Bettys and Taylors of Harrogate|Bettys Caf√©]] Tea Rooms. Bettys' founder, Frederick Belmont, travelled on the maiden voyage of the ''[[RMS Queen Mary|Queen Mary]]'' in 1936. He was so impressed by the splendour of the ship that he employed the Queen Mary's designers and craftsmen to turn a dilapidated furniture store in York into an elegant caf√© in St Helen's Square. A few years after Bettys opened in York war broke out, and the basement 'Bettys Bar' became a favourite haunt of the thousands of airmen stationed around York. 'Bettys Mirror', on which many of them engraved their signatures with a diamond pen, remains on display today as a tribute to them.&lt;ref&gt;
