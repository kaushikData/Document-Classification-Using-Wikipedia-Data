'''Ādesha''' or '''Ādeśa''' ([[Sanskrit]]: आदेश) means 'an order', 'command' or 'advice', 'instruction', 'precept', 'rule'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=Vaman Shivram Apte|publisher=The Digital Libraries of South Asia|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=Adesa&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meaning ==

The word, Ādesha appears to be a semantically polyvalent compound representing two homonymous compounds of different origin and formation; it was surmised that ''ādeśa-''  in the sense of "substitute" owes its origin to a combination of ''ā-'' and ''deśa-'', whereas ''ādeśa-'' in the sense of "advice" belongs to the verb ''ā- diś-'' "to point out, to teach";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Old Indian|author=Jan Gonda|publisher=BRILL|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LBhe0nMwKbUC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=adesa+vedas#v=onepage&amp;q=adesa%20vedas&amp;f=false|isbn=9004026428|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the combination of ''ā-'' meaning 'toward', and ''diś'' meaning 'to show or direct'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Language of the Gods|author=Judith M. Tyberg|publisher=East West Culture|page=117|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OxARAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=adesa+upanishads&amp;dq=adesa+upanishads|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grammatical usage ==

''Nirvachanashastra'' is a heremeneutic device that is used for word-analysis and derivation. The proper understanding of the relation in ''nirvachana'' analysis between a noun and some activity, expressed by a finite verb or by mention of a verbal root came to the fore through the study of [[Yāska]]'s [[Nirukta]] done in the light of a model of substitution according to which model ''adesha'' ('substitution') takes the ''sthana'' ('place') of the original ''sthanin'' ('place-holder') under the given circumstances. ''Sthana'' refers to ''artha'' ('meaning'), thus ''nirvachanas'' are merely place-holders in semantic space; one gets a different thought if one gets a different sentence to represent the same truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy|author=Oliver Leaman|publisher=Taylor and francis|page=388|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TltLxZX4VB4C&amp;pg=PA388&amp;dq=Adesha#v=onepage&amp;q=Adesha&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-415-17281-3|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By using ''Ādeśa'' rather than ''vikāra'', and holding on to ''varna-samāmnāya'' sound system, [[Pāṇini]] was able to achieve economy and brevity in the statements of algebraic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pre-Panian Linguistic Studies|author=D.D.Mahulkar|publisher=Northern Book Centre|page=154|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vsNF-yuHEgYC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=adesa+vedas#v=onepage&amp;q=adesa%20vedas&amp;f=false|isbn=9788185119885|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the rule, requiring the substitution of soft unaspirate consonants in the place of hard consonants, the ''ādeśa'' that takes place in place of a vowel is not ''sthānvit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Astadhyayi of Panini|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TbzVy6vqyCkC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=adesa+vedas#v=onepage&amp;q=adesa%20vedas&amp;f=false|isbn=9788120804098|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panini uses ''ādeśa'' in the sense of 'substitution' and 'substitute'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Semantic Analysis|author=Eivind Kahrs|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=179|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z0_JQXYkG7IC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=principle+of+adesa#v=onepage&amp;q=principle%20of%20adesa&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-521-63188-4|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vadha'' is not an independent root in the Paninian system it is an adesa for the root ''han-''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Aorist and Panini|author=Prasad P.

== Upanishadic usage ==

The [[Upanishads]] have given four [[Mahāvākyas]] or grand proclamations corresponding to four prescribed practices viz. ''Upadesha'', ''Adesha'',  ''Abhyasa'' and ''Anubhava''; accordingly the ''vakya'' – [[Tat Tvam Asi]], appearing in the [[Chandogya Upanishad]], is an ''Adesha Vakya'', a command statement; the ''[[Guru-shishya tradition|shishya]]'' or 'disciple' listens to the ''Upadesha vakya'' and the ''Adhesha vakya'' with full faith and devotion which act is called Sravana ('concentration').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guru Chritra|author=V.R.Prabhu|publisher=Jaico Publishing House|page=|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8ha7SJ4zByMC&amp;pg=RA2-PT4&amp;lpg=RA2-PT4&amp;dq=adesha+upanishads#v=onepage&amp;q=adesha%20upanishads&amp;f=false|isbn=9788179924198|date=2004-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Sanskrit phrase - अथात आदेशः नेति नेति ''athāta ādeśah: neti neti'', meaning – 'now hence the teaching: not this, not this' of [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]II.ii.6, ''Adesha'' means 'specific instruction' and not 'substitute'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Semantic Analysis|author=Eivind Kahrs|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=181–182|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z0_JQXYkG7IC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;dq=adesa+vedas#v=onepage&amp;q=adesa%20vedas&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-521-63188-4|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Taittiriya Upanishad]](II.iii.1), in the very brief part reading -  आदेश आत्मा, the word, ''Adesha'', refers to the ''[[brahmana]]'' portion as the self ('trunk')when the sage says that the self constituted by mind is also of a human shape the shape the human shape the mental body takes after the human shape of the vital body. [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] explains that the word, ''Ādeśah'' here means the ''brahmana'' portion of the [[Vedas]], since (in consonance with the etymological meaning of ''ādeśa'', command) the ''brahmana'' portion inculcates all that has to be enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eight Upanishads Vol.1 1986 Ed|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=311–313|isbn= 978-8175050174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mercantile usage ==

[[Chanakya]] in his [[Arthashastra]], refers to the then prevalent [[Negotiable instrument|bill of exchange]] called ''Ādesha'' which was an order to a third person to pay up a sum of money on behalf of the sender of that order; in those days [[Guild|merchant guilds]] performed the functions of [[bank]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Economic History of Ancient India|author=Santosh kumar Das|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=174|url=https://books.google.com/?id=J4njwI7BMVEC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=Adesha#v=onepage&amp;q=Adesha&amp;f=false|isbn=9788130704234|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was considerable use of these instruments, including promissory notes, and merchants in large towns gave [[Letter of credit|letters of credit]] to one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Law Relating to Cheques|author=Ram Naresh Chaudhary|publisher=Deep and Deep Publications|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dOkzh2CazmQC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=Adesha#v=onepage&amp;q=Adesha&amp;f=false|isbn=9788184502084|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other usages ==

[[Sri Aurobindo|Aurobindo]] explains that the intellectual ''[[Asura]]'' determines his actions by his reason or ideal, the emotional ''Asura'' by his feelings; but the Shuddha determines them by the higher inspiration proceeding from the divine experience in the [[Vijñāna|Vijanana]], that is what people often call the ''Adesha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Records of Yoga Vol.2|author=Sri Aurobindo|publisher=Sri Aurobindo Ashram|page=1387|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iMHWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Adesha&amp;dq=Adesha|isbn=9788170586524|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Keshab Chandra Sen]] of [[Brahmo Samaj]] (and founder of ''Brahmo Samaj of India'') influenced by [[Christian theology]] propounded the doctrine of ''Adesha'', according to which God inspires knowledge in some individuals whose word must therefore be considered infallible and true which doctrine not accepted by some members witnessed division in ranks and the formation of ''Sadharan Brahmo Samaj''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Background of Indian Nationalism|author=A.R.Desai|publisher=Popular Prakashan|page=271|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZykLXjdG9S8C&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=Adesha+upanishads#v=onepage&amp;q=Adesha%20upanishads&amp;f=false|isbn=9788171546671|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Bhagavad Gita]] Sloka XVII.22, it is seen that the word अदेशकाले (ādeśkāle) with the dropping of a mātra i.e. ā to a (and thus providing negative connotation), refers to wrong time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita Demystified Vol.3|author=Nithyananda|publisher=eNPublishers|page=630|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UeFlGR5LtjkC&amp;pg=PA630&amp;dq=adesa+vedas#v=onepage&amp;q=adesa%20vedas&amp;f=false|isbn=978-1-60607-073-4|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15383">'''Affect''' (from [[Latin]] ''affectus'' or ''adfectus'') is a [[concept]], used in the [[philosophy]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]] and elaborated by [[Henri Bergson]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], that places emphasis on bodily or [[Embodied cognition|embodied]] experience. The concept of [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] takes on a different meaning in [[psychology]] and other fields. 

For Spinoza, as discussed in Parts Two and Three of his ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', affects are states of mind and body that are related to (but not exactly synonymous with) feelings and emotions, of which he says there are three primary kinds: pleasure or joy (''laetitia''),&lt;ref name="Spinoza2001a"&gt;Part III, Proposition 56. {{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent philosophical usage by Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari and their translator Brian Massumi, while derived explicitly from Spinoza, tends to distinguish more sharply than Spinoza does between affect and what are conventionally called emotions. Affects are difficult to grasp and conceptualize because, as Spinoza says, "an affect or passion of the mind [''animi pathema''] is a confused idea" which is only perceived by the increase or decrease it causes in the body's vital force.&lt;ref name="Spinoza2001c"&gt;''Existendi vis'' or power of existence. {{cite book

== In Spinoza ==
In [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', Part III Definition 3, the term "affect" (''affectus'', traditionally translated as "emotion")&lt;ref&gt;Of the two "standard" English translations, the version by Samuel Shirley uses "emotion" for ''affectus'', whereas the more recent rendering by Edwin Curley uses "affect". {{cite book

Affect is thus a special case of the more neutral term "affection" (''affectio''), which designates the form "taken on" by some thing,&lt;ref name="SpinozaShirley1992"&gt;Samuel Shirley, "Translator's Preface". {{cite book

In Part III, "Definitions of the Emotions/Affects", Spinoza defines 48 different forms of affect, including love and hatred, hope and fear, envy and compassion. They are nearly all manifestations of the three basic affects of:
* desire (''cupiditas'') or appetite (''appetitus''), defined as "the very essence of man insofar as his essence is conceived as determined to any action from any given affection of itself";&lt;ref name=SpinozaCurley1994b&gt;{{cite book |last=Spinoza |first=Benedictus de |authorlink=Baruch Spinoza |others=Trans. by Edwin M. Curley |title=A Spinoza Reader: The Ethics and Other Works |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5yeKQgAACAAJ |accessdate=27 November 2011 |year=1994 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton and Chichester |isbn=978-0-691-00067-1 |page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* pleasure (''laetitia''), defined as "man's transition from a state of less perfection to a state of greater perfection";&lt;ref name=SpinozaCurley1994b /&gt; and
* pain or sorrow (''tristitia''), defined as "man's transition from a state of greater perfection to a state of less perfection".&lt;ref name=SpinozaCurley1994b /&gt;
In Spinoza's view, since God's power of activity is infinite, any affection which increases the organism's power of activity leads to greater perfection. Affects are transitional states or modes in that they are vital forces by which the organism strives to act against other forces which act on it and continually resist it or hold it in check.&lt;ref name="Kisner2011"&gt;{{cite book

== In Bergson ==
[[Henri Bergson]] contends in ''[[Matter and Memory]]'' (1896) that we do not know our body only "from without" by [[perception]]s, but also "from within" by affections (French: ''affections'').&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, ''Matter and Memory'' (1896), [https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Bergson/Bergson_1911b/Bergson_1911_01.html ch. 1].&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Deleuze and Guattari ==
The terms "affect" and "affection" came to prominence in [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]'s ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'', the second volume of ''Capitalism and Schizophrenia''. In his notes on the terminology employed, the translator Brian Massumi gives the following definitions of the terms as used in the volume:
:AFFECT/AFFECTION. Neither word denotes a personal feeling (''sentiment'' in Deleuze and Guattari). ''L'affect'' (Spinoza's ''affectus'') is an ability to affect and be affected. It is a prepersonal intensity corresponding to the passage from one experiential state of the body to another and implying an augmentation or diminution in that body's capacity to act. ''L'affection'' (Spinoza's ''affectio'') is each such state considered as an encounter between the affected body and a second, affecting, body (with body taken in its broadest possible sense to include "mental" or ideal bodies).&lt;ref name="DeleuzeGuattari1987"&gt;{{cite book

Affects, according to Deleuze, are not simple [[affection]]s, as they are independent from their [[subject (philosophy)|subject]].
Artists create affects and [[percept]]s, "blocks of space-time", whereas science works with functions, according to Deleuze, and philosophy creates concepts.

Since 2000, a number of authors in the social sciences and humanities have begun to explore affect theory as a way of understanding spheres of experience (including bodily experience) which fall outside of the dominant paradigm of representation (based on [[rhetoric]] and [[semiotics]]); this movement has been called the &lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;'''affective turn'''.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Ticineto Clough, [[Jean Halley]] (eds.), ''The Affective Turn: Theorizing the Social'', Duke University Press, 2007, p. 1; Paul Hoggett, Simon Thompson (eds.), ''Politics and the Emotions: The Affective Turn in Contemporary Political Studies'', Bloomsbury, 2012, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, these approaches are interested in the widest possible variety of interactions and encounters, interactions and encounters that are not necessarily limited to human sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seyfert|first=Robert |year=2012|title=Beyond Personal Feelings and Collective Emotions: A Theory of Social Affect|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society|volume=29/6|pages= 35|doi=10.1177/0263276412438591}}&lt;/ref&gt; The translator of Deleuze and Guattari's ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'', Canadian political philosopher [[Brian Massumi]], has given influential definitions of affect (see above) and has written on the neglected importance of movement and sensation in cultural formations and our interaction with real and virtual worlds.&lt;ref name="Massumi2002"&gt;  {{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37065">The '''analytic–synthetic distinction''' (also called the '''analytic–synthetic dichotomy''') is a [[Semantics|semantic]] distinction, used primarily in [[philosophy]] to distinguish propositions (in particular, statements that are affirmative subject–predicate judgments) into two types: '''analytic propositions''' and '''synthetic propositions'''. Analytic propositions are true by virtue of their meaning, while synthetic propositions are true by how their meaning relates to the world.&lt;ref name=Rey/&gt; However, philosophers have used the terms in very different ways. Furthermore, philosophers have debated whether there is a legitimate distinction.

==Kant==
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]

===Conceptual containment===
The philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] uses the terms "analytic" and "synthetic" to divide propositions into two types. Kant introduces the analytic–synthetic distinction in the Introduction to his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781/1998, A6–7/B10–11). There, he restricts his attention to statements that are affirmative [[Subject (grammar)|subject]]-[[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] judgments and defines "analytic proposition" and "synthetic proposition" as follows:
* '''analytic proposition''': a proposition whose predicate concept is contained in its subject concept
* '''synthetic proposition''': a proposition whose predicate concept is '''not''' contained in its subject concept but related

Examples of analytic propositions, on Kant's definition, include:
* "All bachelors are unmarried."
* "All triangles have three sides."

Kant's own example is:
* "All bodies are extended," that is, occupy space. (A7/B11)

Each of these statements is an affirmative subject-predicate judgment, and, in each, the predicate concept is ''contained'' within the subject concept. The concept "bachelor" contains the concept "unmarried"; the concept "unmarried" is part of the definition of the concept "bachelor". Likewise, for "triangle" and "has three sides", and so on.

Examples of synthetic propositions, on Kant's definition, include:
* "All bachelors are alone."
* "All creatures with hearts have kidneys."

Kant's own example is:
* "All bodies are heavy", that is, they experience a gravitational force. (A7/B11)

As with the previous examples classified as analytic propositions, each of these new statements is an affirmative subject–predicate judgment. However, in none of these cases does the subject concept contain the predicate concept. The concept "bachelor" does not contain the concept "alone"; "alone" is not a part of the ''definition'' of "bachelor". The same is true for "creatures with hearts" and "have kidneys"; even if every creature with a heart also has kidneys, the concept "creature with a heart" does not contain the concept "has kidneys".

===Kant's version and the ''a priori''&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;''a posteriori'' distinction===
{{main|A priori and a posteriori}}
In the Introduction to the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', Kant contrasts his distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions with another distinction, the distinction between [[a priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] and [[Empirical evidence|''a posteriori'']] propositions. He defines these terms as follows:
* '''''a priori''''' '''proposition''': a proposition whose justification does ''not'' rely upon experience. Moreover, the proposition can be validated by experience, but is not grounded in experience. Therefore, it is logically necessary.
* '''''a posteriori''''' '''proposition''': a proposition whose justification does rely upon experience. The proposition is validated by, and grounded in, experience. Therefore, it is logically contingent.

Examples of ''a priori'' propositions include:
* "All bachelors are unmarried."
* "7 + 5 = 12."

The justification of these propositions does not depend upon experience: one need not consult experience to determine whether all bachelors are unmarried, nor whether {{nowrap|1=7 + 5 = 12}}. (Of course, as Kant would grant, experience is required to understand the concepts "bachelor", "unmarried", "7", "+" and so forth. However, the ''a priori'' / ''a posteriori'' distinction as employed here by Kant refers not to the ''origins'' of the concepts but to the ''justification'' of the propositions. Once we have the concepts, experience is no longer necessary.)

Examples of ''a posteriori'' propositions include:
* "All bachelors are unhappy."
* "Tables exist."

Both of these propositions are ''a posteriori'': any justification of them would require one's experience.

The analytic/synthetic distinction and the ''a priori'' / ''a posteriori'' distinction together yield four types of propositions:
# analytic ''a priori''
# synthetic ''a priori''
# analytic ''a posteriori''
# synthetic ''a posteriori''

Kant posits the third type as obviously self-contradictory.  Ruling it out, he discusses only the remaining three types as components of his epistemological framework{{mdash}}each, for brevity's sake, becoming, respectively, "analytic", "synthetic a priori", and "empirical" or "a posteriori" propositions. This triad will account for all propositions possible.

===The ease of knowing analytic propositions===
Part of Kant's argument in the Introduction to the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' involves arguing that there is no problem figuring out how knowledge of analytic propositions is possible. To know an analytic proposition, Kant argued, one need not consult experience. Instead, one needs merely to take the subject and "extract from it, in accordance with the principle of contradiction, the required predicate" (A7/B12). In analytic propositions, the predicate concept is contained in the subject concept. Thus, to know an analytic proposition is true, one need merely examine the concept of the subject. If one finds the predicate contained in the subject, the judgment is true.

Thus, for example, one need not consult experience to determine whether "All bachelors are unmarried" is true. One need merely examine the subject concept ("bachelors") and see if the predicate concept "unmarried" is contained in it. And in fact, it is: "unmarried" is part of the definition of "bachelor" and so is contained within it. Thus the proposition "All bachelors are unmarried" can be known to be true without consulting experience.

It follows from this, Kant argued, first: All analytic propositions are ''a priori''; there are no ''a posteriori'' analytic propositions. It follows, second: There is no problem understanding how we can know analytic propositions;  we can know them because we only need to consult our concepts in order to determine that they are true.

===The possibility of metaphysics===
After ruling out the possibility of analytic ''a posteriori'' propositions, and explaining how we can obtain knowledge of analytic ''a priori'' propositions, Kant also explains how we can obtain knowledge of synthetic ''a posteriori'' propositions. That leaves only the question of how knowledge of synthetic ''a priori'' propositions is possible. This question is exceedingly important, Kant maintains, because all important metaphysical knowledge is of synthetic ''a priori'' propositions. If it is impossible to determine which synthetic ''a priori'' propositions are true, he argues, then metaphysics as a discipline is impossible. The remainder of the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' is devoted to examining whether and how knowledge of synthetic ''a priori'' propositions is possible.&lt;ref name=Langford1949&gt; See [[Cooper Harold Langford]] (1949)'s ostensive proof: {{cite journal|title= A Proof That Synthetic A Priori Propositions Exist|journal= The Journal of Philosophy|year= 1949 |volume= 46|number= 1| date= 1949-01-06|pages= 20–24 |jstor=2019526 |last1= Langford|first1= C. H.|authorlink1=Cooper Harold Langford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logical positivists==

===Frege and Carnap revise the Kantian definition===
Over a hundred years later, a group of philosophers took interest in Kant and his distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions: the [[Logical positivism|logical positivists]].

Part of Kant's examination of the possibility of synthetic ''a priori'' knowledge involved the examination of mathematical propositions, such as
* "7 + 5 = 12." (B15–16)
* "The shortest distance between two points is a straight line." (B16–17)

Kant maintained that mathematical propositions such as these are synthetic ''a priori'' propositions, and that we know them. That they are synthetic, he thought, is obvious: the concept "equal to 12" is not contained within the concept "7 + 5";  and the concept "straight line" is not contained within the concept "the shortest distance between two points". From this, Kant concluded that we have knowledge of synthetic ''a priori'' propositions.

[[Gottlob Frege]]'s notion of analyticity included a number of logical properties and relations beyond containment: [[symmetry]], [[transitive relation|transitivity]], [[antonymy]], or [[negation]] and so on. He had a strong emphasis on formality, in particular formal definition, and also emphasized the idea of substitution of synonymous terms. "All bachelors are unmarried" can be expanded out with the formal definition of bachelor as "unmarried man" to form "All unmarried men are unmarried", which is recognizable as tautologous and therefore analytic from its logical form: any statement of the form "All ''X'' that are (''F'' and ''G'') are ''F''". Using this particular expanded idea of analyticity, Frege concluded that Kant's examples of arithmetical truths are analytical ''a priori'' truths and ''not'' synthetic ''a priori'' truths.

{{quote|1=Thanks to Frege's logical semantics, particularly his concept of analyticity, arithmetic truths like "7+5=12" are no longer synthetic ''a priori'' but analytical ''a priori'' truths in [[Carnap]]'s extended sense of "analytic".
Hence logical empiricists are not subject to Kant's criticism of Hume for throwing out mathematics along with metaphysics.&lt;ref name=Katz/&gt;}}

(Here "logical empiricist" is a synonym for "logical positivist".)

===The origin of the logical positivist's distinction===
The logical positivists agreed with Kant that we have knowledge of mathematical truths, and further that mathematical propositions are ''a priori''. However, they did not believe that any complex metaphysics, such as the type Kant supplied, are necessary to explain our knowledge of mathematical truths. Instead, the logical positivists maintained that our knowledge of judgments like "all bachelors are unmarried" and our knowledge of mathematics (and logic) are in the basic sense the same: all proceeded from our knowledge of the meanings of terms or the conventions of language.

{{quote|Since empiricism had always asserted that ''all'' knowledge is based on experience, this assertion had to include knowledge in mathematics. On the other hand, we believed that with respect to this problem the rationalists had been right in rejecting the old empiricist view that the truth of "&lt;nowiki&gt;2+2=4&lt;/nowiki&gt;" is contingent on the observation of facts, a view that would lead to the unacceptable consequence that an arithmetical statement might possibly be refuted tomorrow by new experiences. Our solution, based upon [[Wittgenstein]]'s conception, consisted in asserting the thesis of empiricism only for factual truth. By contrast, the truths of logic and mathematics are not in need of confirmation by observations, because they do not state anything about the world of facts, they hold for any possible combination of facts.&lt;ref name=Schlipp/&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedman/&gt;|Rudolf Carnap|Autobiography: §10: Semantics, p. 64}}

===Logical positivist definitions===
Thus the logical positivists drew a new distinction, and, inheriting the terms from Kant, named it the "analytic/synthetic distinction".&lt;ref name=Ebbs/&gt; They provided many different definitions, such as the following:
# '''analytic proposition''': a proposition whose truth depends solely on the meaning of its terms
# '''analytic proposition''': a proposition that is true (or false) by definition
# '''analytic proposition''': a proposition that is made true (or false) solely by the conventions of language

(While the logical positivists believed that the only necessarily true propositions were analytic, they did not define "analytic proposition" as "necessarily true proposition" or "proposition that is true in all possible worlds".)

Synthetic propositions were then defined as:
* '''synthetic proposition''': a proposition that is not analytic

These definitions applied to all propositions, regardless of whether they were of subject–predicate form. Thus, under these definitions, the proposition "It is raining or it is not raining" was classified as analytic, while for Kant it was analytic by virtue of its logical form. And the proposition "{{nowrap|1=7 + 5 = 12}}" was classified as analytic, while under Kant's definitions it was synthetic.

==Two-dimensionalism==
[[Two-dimensionalism]] is an approach to [[semantics]] in [[analytic philosophy]]. It is a theory of how to determine the [[sense and reference]] of a [[word]] and the [[truth-value]] of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. It is intended to resolve a puzzle that has plagued philosophy for some time, namely: How is it possible to discover empirically that a [[necessary truth]] is [[Truth|true]]? Two-dimensionalism provides an analysis of the semantics of words and sentences that makes sense of this possibility. The theory was first developed by [[Robert Stalnaker]], but it has been advocated by numerous philosophers since, including [[David Chalmers]] and [[Berit Brogaard]].

Any given sentence, for example, the words,
:"Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O"

is taken to express two distinct [[proposition]]s, often referred to as a ''primary intension'' and a ''secondary intension'', which together compose its [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]].&lt;ref name=Chalmers/&gt;

The primary [[intension]] of a word or sentence is its [[sense and reference|sense]], i.e., is the idea or method by which we find its referent. The primary intension of "water" might be a description, such as ''watery stuff''. The thing picked out by the primary intension of "water" could have been otherwise. For example, on some other world where the inhabitants take "water" to mean ''watery stuff'', but, where the chemical make-up of watery stuff is not H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, it is not the case that water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O for that world.

The ''secondary intension'' of "water" is whatever thing "water" happens to pick out in ''this'' world, whatever that world happens to be. So if we assign "water" the primary intension ''watery stuff'' then the secondary intension of "water" is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, since H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is ''watery stuff'' in this world. The secondary intension of "water" in our world is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in every world because unlike ''watery stuff'' it is impossible for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to be other than H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. When considered according to its secondary intension, "Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" is true in every world.

If two-dimensionalism is workable it solves some very important problems in the philosophy of language. [[Saul Kripke]] has argued that "Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" is an example of the ''[[necessary truth|necessary]] [[a posteriori]]'', since we had to discover that water was H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, but given that it is true, it cannot be false. It would be absurd to claim that something that is water is not H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, for these are known to be ''identical''.

==Quine's criticisms==
{{See also|Willard Van Orman Quine#Rejection of the analytic–synthetic distinction|Two Dogmas of Empiricism#Analyticity and circularity}}
[[Rudolf Carnap]] was a strong proponent of the distinction between what he called "internal questions", questions entertained within a "framework" (like a mathematical theory), and "external questions", questions posed outside any framework&amp;nbsp;– posed before the adoption of any framework.&lt;ref name=Carnap/&gt;&lt;ref name=Russell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Murzi/&gt; The "internal" questions could be of two types: ''logical'' (or analytic, or logically true) and ''factual'' (empirical, that is, matters of observation interpreted using terms from a framework). The "external" questions were also of two types: those that were confused pseudo-questions ("one disguised in the form of a theoretical question") and those that could be re-interpreted as practical, pragmatic questions about whether a framework under consideration was "more or less expedient, fruitful, conducive to the aim for which the language is intended".&lt;ref name=Carnap/&gt; The adjective "synthetic" was not used by Carnap in his 1950 work ''Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology''.&lt;ref name=Carnap/&gt; Carnap did define a "synthetic truth" in his work ''[[Meaning and Necessity]]'': a sentence that is true, but not simply because "the semantical rules of the system suffice for establishing its truth".&lt;ref name=Carnap2/&gt;

The notion of a synthetic truth is of something that is true both because of what it means and because of the way the world is, whereas analytic truths are true in virtue of meaning alone. Thus, what Carnap calls internal ''factual'' statements (as opposed to internal ''logical'' statements) could be taken as being also synthetic truths because they require ''observations'', but some external statements also could be "synthetic" statements and Carnap would be doubtful about their status. The analytic–synthetic argument therefore is not identical with the [[internal–external distinction]].&lt;ref name=Yablo/&gt;

In 1951, [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] published the essay "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]" in which he argued that the analytic–synthetic distinction is untenable.&lt;ref name=Dogmas/&gt; The argument at bottom is that there are no "analytic" truths, but all truths involve an empirical aspect. In the first paragraph, Quine takes the distinction to be the following:
* analytic propositions&amp;nbsp;– propositions grounded in meanings, independent of matters of fact.
* synthetic propositions&amp;nbsp;– propositions grounded in fact.

Quine's position denying the analytic-synthetic distinction is summarized as follows:
{{quote|It is obvious that truth in general depends on both language and extralinguistic fact. ... Thus one is tempted to suppose in general that the truth of a statement is somehow analyzable into a linguistic component and a factual component. Given this supposition, it next seems reasonable that in some statements the factual component should be null; and these are the analytic statements. But, for all its ''a priori'' reasonableness, a boundary between analytic and synthetic statements simply has not been drawn. That there is such a distinction to be drawn at all is an unempirical dogma of empiricists, a metaphysical article of faith.&lt;ref name=Quine4/&gt;|Willard v. O. Quine|"Two Dogmas of Empiricism", p. 64}}

To summarize Quine's argument, the notion of an analytic proposition requires a notion of synonymy, but establishing synonymy inevitably leads to matters of fact&amp;nbsp;– synthetic propositions. Thus, there is no non-circular (and so no tenable) way to ground the notion of analytic propositions.

While Quine's rejection of the analytic–synthetic distinction is widely known, the precise argument for the rejection and its status is highly debated in contemporary philosophy. However, some (for example, Boghossian&lt;ref name=Boghossian/&gt;) argue that Quine's rejection of the distinction is still widely accepted among philosophers, even if for poor reasons.

===Responses===
[[Paul Grice]] and [[P. F. Strawson]] criticized "Two Dogmas" in their 1956 article "In Defense of a Dogma".&lt;ref name=Defense/&gt; Among other things, they argue that Quine's [[skepticism]] about synonyms leads to a skepticism about meaning. If statements can have meanings, then it would make sense to ask "What does it mean?". If it makes sense to ask "What does it mean?", then synonymy can be defined as follows: Two sentences are synonymous if and only if the true answer of the question "What does it mean?" asked of one of them is the true answer to the same question asked of the other. They also draw the conclusion that discussion about correct or incorrect translations would be impossible given Quine's argument. Four years after Grice and Strawson published their paper, Quine's book ''[[Word and Object]]'' was released. In the book Quine presented his theory of [[indeterminacy of translation]].

In ''Speech Acts'', [[John Searle]] argues that from the difficulties encountered in trying to explicate analyticity by appeal to specific criteria, it does not follow that the notion itself is void.&lt;ref name=Searle/&gt; Considering the way which we would test any proposed list of criteria, which is by comparing their extension to the set of analytic statements, it would follow that any explication of what analyticity means presupposes that we already have at our disposal a working notion of analyticity.

In "'Two Dogmas' Revisited", [[Hilary Putnam]] argues that Quine is attacking two different notions:&lt;ref name=Putnam/&gt;
{{quote|It seems to me there is as gross a distinction between 'All bachelors are unmarried' and 'There is a book on this table' as between any two things in this world, or at any rate, between any two linguistic expressions in the world;&lt;ref name=Putnam2/&gt;|Hilary Putnam|''Philosophical Papers'', p. 36}}

Analytic truth defined as a true statement derivable from a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] by putting synonyms for synonyms is near [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] account of analytic truth as a truth whose negation is a contradiction. Analytic truth defined as a truth confirmed no matter what, however, is closer to one of the traditional accounts of ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. While the first four sections of Quine's paper concern analyticity, the last two concern a priority. Putnam considers the argument in the two last sections as independent of the first four, and at the same time as Putnam criticizes Quine, he also emphasizes his historical importance as the first top rank philosopher to both reject the notion of a priority and sketch a methodology without it.&lt;ref name=Putnam1/&gt;

[[Jerrold Katz]], a one-time associate of [[Noam Chomsky]], countered the arguments of "Two Dogmas" directly by trying to define analyticity non-circularly on the syntactical features of sentences.&lt;ref name=Linsky/&gt;&lt;ref name=Quine/&gt;&lt;ref name=Katz1/&gt;

In ''Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century, Volume 1 : The Dawn of Analysis'', [[Scott Soames]] has pointed out that Quine's circularity argument needs two of the logical positivists' central theses to be effective:&lt;ref name=Soames/&gt;

:All necessary (and all ''a priori'') truths are analytic

:Analyticity is needed to explain and legitimate necessity.

It is only when these two theses are accepted that Quine's argument holds. It is not a problem that the notion of necessity is presupposed by the notion of analyticity if necessity can be explained without analyticity. According to Soames, both theses were accepted by most philosophers when Quine published "Two Dogmas". Today, however, Soames holds both statements to be antiquated. He says: "Very few philosophers today would accept either [of these assertions], both of which now seem decidedly antique."&lt;ref name=Soames/&gt;

==Peikoff's criticisms==
Philosopher [[Leonard Peikoff]], in his essay "The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy",&lt;ref&gt;Peikoff, Leonard, "The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy" In ''Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology'' by Ayn Rand, Meridian Press, 1979, p 94 (first published in ''The Objectivist'' May 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; expands upon [[Ayn Rand]]'s analysis. He posits that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The theory of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy presents men with the following choice: If your statement is proved, it says nothing about that which exists; if it is about existents, it cannot be proved. If it is demonstrated by logical argument, it represents a subjective convention; if it asserts a fact, logic cannot establish it. If you validate it by an appeal to the meanings of your ''concepts'', then it is cut off from reality; if you validate it by an appeal to your ''percepts'', then you cannot be certain of it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
To Peikoff, the critical question is: What is included in the meaning of a concept?  He rejects the idea that some of the characteristics of a concept's referents are excluded from the concept.  Applying Rand's theory&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn, ''Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology,'' 2nd edition, Meridian (Penguin Books), 1990 (first published in ''The Objectivist,'' July 1966 - February 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;  that a concept is a "mental integration" of similar existents, treated as "units", he argues that concepts stand for and mean the actual existents, including all their characteristics, not just those used to pick out the referents or define the concept. He states,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since a concept is an integration of units, it has no content or meaning apart from its units. The meaning of a concept consists of the units — the existents — which it integrates, including all the characteristics of these units.... The fact that certain characteristics are, at a given time, unknown to man, does not indicate that these characteristics are excluded from the entity — or from the concept.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Furthermore, he argues that there is no valid distinction between "necessary" and "contingent" facts, and that all truths are learned and validated by the same process: the application of logic to perceptual data.  Associated with the analytic-synthetic dichotomy are a cluster of other divisions that Objectivism also regards as false and artificial, such as logical truth vs. factual truth, logically possible vs. empirically possible, and a priori vs. the a posteriori.

'''Andries Tatane''' (22 February 1978 – 13 April 2011) was a 33-year-old South African citizen who was shot and killed by police officers during a [[Protest in South Africa|service delivery protest]] in [[Ficksburg]]. Seven police officers accused of his murder and assault were acquitted in the Ficksburg Regional Court in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court acquits police officers in Andries Tatane case|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/2013/03/28/court-acquits-police-officers-in-andries-tatane-case|accessdate=11 April 2013|newspaper=Business Day|date=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tatane: So many questions remain |url=http://www.citypress.co.za/news/tatane-so-many-questions-remain/ |accessdate=11 April 2013 |newspaper=City Press |date=31 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410192628/http://www.citypress.co.za/news/tatane-so-many-questions-remain/ |archivedate=10 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Andries was a member of the [[African National Congress|ANC]] until 2008 when he left the ANC to join the breakaway party [[Congress of the People (South African political party)|COPE]]. In the months before he died he left COPE to join the Meqheleng Concerned Citizens (MCC), an autonomous local community organisation.&lt;ref name=MGWhoWasAT&gt;{{cite news|last=Sosibo|first=Kwanele|title=Who was Andries Tatane?|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-04-21-who-was-andries-tatane|accessdate=16 August 2011|newspaper=Mail &amp; Guardian|date=21 April 2011|quote="He was a very brilliant student, a pioneer by nature. He was very skilled in initiating things that would benefit others. He wanted to see all the people freed from unemployment and illiteracy."}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a mathematics teacher, a community activist, journalist, community newspaper publisher and possible independent candidate for the municipal elections due to take place in May 2011.  He was married to Rose Tatane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whoswhosa.co.za/andries-tatane Andries Tatane entry at ''Who's Who of Southern Africa'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events surrounding his death==

On 13 April 2011, Andries Tatane, together with 4,000 other protesters, took to the streets and marched to [[Setsoto Local Municipality|Setsoto Municipal Offices]] in Ficksburg, Free State, South Africa to protest against poor service delivery in the area. The protesters were met by [[South African Police Service|police members]] who attempted to disperse the crowd with water cannons. While some arrested protesters were being bundled into police vans, Tatane tried to argue with the police and to block a water cannon vehicle, at which point he was grabbed around one arm by a police officer. Tatane was seen to pull his arm away from the officer who then started to beat him with a baton. Tatane appeared to move aggressively towards this officer. Four or five other police officers then pulled him away and began to kick and beat him with batons. During this time he was twice shot in the chest. Tatane collapsed shortly after and died on the scene 20 minutes later.

While Tatane's death as a result of police action during a protest is by no means a unique event in South Africa, it had notably garnered greater nationwide attention than any previous such occurrence. One of the main reasons for this was the fact that the entire incident was filmed on T.V. cameras and later broadcast during the prime time evening news of the national broadcaster, the SABC.

==Aftermath==

Following Tatane's death, there has been public outrage about the manner in which he died.&lt;ref&gt;Several opinion pieces in South African newsmedia:

Tatane's death has been described as "a watershed moment in public perceptions of state violence after apartheid".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2011-05-05-it-is-time-to-be-offended It is time to be offended], Herman Wasserman &amp; Sean Jacobs, ''The Daily Maverick'', 8 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation into his death was launched by the [[Independent Complaints Directorate]]'s commission. The [[South African Police Service]] has also launched their own internal investigation into the matter. The death of Tatane has placed both the issue of rising anger over a lack of service delivery as well as police brutality in the media spotlight, with comparisons being drawn&lt;ref name=Sowetan&gt;{{cite news|last=Mngxitama|first=Andile|title=Tatane's death underlines need for government to deliver|url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/columnists/2011/04/19/tatane-s-death-underlines-need-for-government-to-deliver|accessdate=23 April 2011|newspaper=The Sowetan|date=19 April 2011|quote=Hector Pieterson was the symbol of the 1976 uprising in the same way that Tatane is the symbol of service delivery struggles today.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to the deaths of [[Hector Pieterson]] and [[Steve Biko]] at the hands of police during the height of [[apartheid]].

It has also emerged that this was not an isolated incident&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/amnesty-red-flag-police-brutality-1.1068706 Amnesty red flag police brutality], Craig Dodds, 13 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/south-africa/report-2011 Amnesty International South Africa Report 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; and that the ICD has investigated 1,769 separate incidents of people dying in police custody or as a result of police action in 2010.&lt;ref name=M&amp;GIsolatedIncident&gt;{{cite news|last=Ilham|first=Rawoot|title=Protester's death not an isolated case|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-04-15-protesters-death-not-an-isolated-case/|date=15 April 2011|accessdate=23 April 2011|newspaper=Mail &amp; Guardian|author2=Underhill, Glynnis|quote=Video footage of the protester, identified as 33-year-old Andries Tatane, caused shockwaves when it was broadcast on SABC (South African Broadcasting Corporation) prime time news on Wednesday evening.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  National Police Commissioner [[Bheki Cele]]'s statement in late August 2009 that police officers should be able to "shoot to kill"&lt;ref name=IOLShootToKill&gt;{{cite news|last=Carvin|first=Goldstone|title=Police must shoot to kill, worry later - Cele|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/police-must-shoot-to-kill-worry-later-cele-1.453587|accessdate=23 April 2011|newspaper=IOL News|date=1 August 2009|quote=Cele's philosophy on shooting before being shot, which he has preached in KwaZulu-Natal during his time as MEC for community safety, has led to the province having more deaths in police custody under review than any other province during the past year.

The [[African National Congress|ANC]]'s National Spokesperson, [[Jackson Mthembu]], condemned the brutality, but also chastised the [[SABC]] for broadcasting the footage during the prime time news, citing the fact that it might have upset sensitive viewers,&lt;ref name=M&amp;GIsolatedIncident/&gt; calling on the [[Independent Communications Authority of South Africa]] (ICASA) to investigate the SABC's editorial decision.  Mthembu has been one of the most vocal supporters of planned legislation to introduce a [[Media Appeals Tribunal]] to govern the South African media;&lt;ref name=M&amp;GMediaTribunal&gt;{{cite news|last=Mandy|first=Rossouw|title=ANC backtracks on media tribunal|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-01-14-anc-backtracks-on-media-tribunal/|accessdate=23 April 2011|newspaper=Mail &amp; Guardian|date=14 January 2011|quote=In July last year Mthembu was adamant there should be even harsher punishment for errant journalists. "If you have to go to prison, let it be. If you have to pay millions for defamation, let it be. If journalists have to be fired because they don't contribute to the South Africa we want, let it be," he told the Mail &amp; Guardian.}}&lt;/ref&gt; legislation which is currently held in abeyance.

After visiting the Tatane family in Meqheleng, Ficksburg, on 19 April 2011, [[Archbishop of Cape Town|Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town]], Dr [[Thabo Makgoba]], directed attention to the lack of justice and delivery on promises which had preceded the incident and points out the irony of the protesters having been met with water cannons, "attacked with the very thing they don’t have the pleasure of in their daily lives."  He called on the Minister of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, [[Sicelo Shiceka]], to "visit and see the appalling conditions under which God’s people live" and the Minister of Human Settlements, [[Tokyo Sexwale]], to "provide houses".  He added that "Minister [[Nathi Mthethwa]] and President [[Jacob Zuma|Zuma]] should publicly apologise for this embarrassing act of aggression by police."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archbishop.anglicanchurchsa.org/2011/04/visit-to-ficksburg-and-tatane-family.html  Visit to Ficksburg and Tatane Family, by the Most Revd Dr Thabo Makgoba, Archbishop of Cape Town, blog dated 21 April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Archbishop has subsequently said: "Let us affirm and call for a renaming of our police services back to 'safety and security' and not a police 'force', for this force seems to maim and kill rather than offer safety and security." &lt;ref&gt;[http://archbishop.anglicanchurchsa.org/2011/04/sermon-at-service-for-renewal-of-vows.html Archbishop Thabo Makgoba’s Sermon at the Service for the Renewal of Vows, Maundy Thursday, 21 April 2011, published 22 April]&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an election boycott in the area following Tatane's death.&lt;ref name="mg.co.za"&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2011-05-20-disillusioned-voters-snub-ficksburg-poll Disillusioned voters snub Ficksburg poll], KWANELE SOSIBO, ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', 20 May 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011 it was reported that the Meqheleng Concerned Citizens group was a credible structure with growing influence.&lt;ref name="mg.co.za"/&gt; However, by December 2011 it had degenerated to the point of being described as "a toothless organisation led by calculating tenderpreneurs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2011-12-23-ficksburg-the-dorpie-where-revolution-was-a-false-alarm Ficksburg: The dorpie where revolution was a false alarm], by Kwanele Sosibo, ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', 23 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of police officers were charged with Tatane's murder but they were found not guilty on the grounds that Tatane's murderers could not be identified as they were wearing helmets. However, a British journalist was easily able to identify his killers from video footage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-07-22-police-brutality-and-the-mass-amnesia-that-threatens-to-obscure-it/#.UeylJY3I2VI Police brutality, and the mass amnesia that threatens to obscure it], Inigo Gilmore, ''Daily Maverick'', 22 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references to Tatane==

In poetry, Andries Tatane's death is referenced in a work by [[Adam Haupt]], entitled "For Andries Tatane".&lt;ref&gt;Thought Leader,[http://www.thoughtleader.co.za/adamhaupt/2011/04/15/for-andries-tatane/] accessed online: 21/04/2011&lt;/ref&gt; This poem has since been republished as the epilogue to a scholarly book titled ''Static: Race &amp; Representation in Post-Apartheid Music, Media &amp; Film'' &lt;ref&gt;Haupt, A.

'''Antihaitianismo''' ({{IPA-es|ˈanti.aitjanˈizmo}}, {{lang-fr|Antihaitienisme}}, {{lang-en|italic=yes|anti-Haitianism}}), also called '''anti-Haitianism''' in some English sources, is prejudice or social discrimination against Haitians in the Dominican Republic.

Antihaitianismo includes prejudice against, hatred of, or discrimination against [[Haiti]]ans and their language, culture, but not their race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fX8rAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 |title=Joaquín Balaguer, Memory, and Diaspora: The Lasting Political Legacies of and Diaspora |page=63 | author=Liberato, Ana S.

==Antihaitianismo in the Dominican Republic==

===Origins: 16th century through 19th century===

[[Human Rights Watch]] has stated in their reports that the differences between Haitians and Dominicans can be based on colonial times from linguistic, cultural, and racial differences. For instance, the [[Dominican Republic]] was governed by the Spanish, and thus acquired part of their culture from the Spanish, mixed with African and Native American. [[Haiti]], on the other hand, was governed by the French, and its culture is a mixture of French, African and Native American. The majority of Haiti's population is descended almost entirely from [[African diaspora|African]] slaves, while [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominicans]] possess a [[multiracial]] mix of Spanish, African and to a lesser extent, Native American ancestry. It is evident that historical background is related between the two countries, however, there are major cultural divisions.
 
''Antihaitianismo'' can be traced back to a policy of [[racial segregation]] instituted by the [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] in the [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo]] (present-day Dominican Republic).&lt;ref name="sagas"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sagás |first=Ernesto |title=A Case of Mistaken Identity: Antihaitianismo in Dominican Culture |publisher=Webster University |url=http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti/misctopic/dominican/antihaiti.htm |accessdate=2007-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008042155/http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti/misctopic/dominican/antihaiti.htm |archivedate=2007-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the arrival of Europeans, [[Hispaniola|the island]] was split into absolutist [[Chiefdoms of Hispaniola|chiefdoms]], three where modern-day Santo Domingo now exists, and two where modern-day Haiti now exists (albeit also including some territory which is currently part of Santo Domingo).  [[Island Caribs|Carib people]] from islands further south were often at war with the [[Taíno people]]. [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] reached the island in 1492 (slaves imported from Africa arrived from 1503 onwards&amp;mdash;many natives were also soon enslaved), and within a few decades the Spanish controlled most of the island. During the 17th century, however, the French also began maneuvering for control, and in 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick|acquired the western portion]] (now part of Haiti&amp;mdash;whereas the Spanish portion encompassed the modern Dominican Republic). During the 1790s and early 19th century, the French and Spanish battled back and forth across the island; by 1809 the [[Haitian Revolution]] had resulted in the overthrow of both French and Spanish control.  The [[Reconquista (Santo Domingo)|Spanish briefly retook]] the eastern portion that same year, but in 1821 [[Republic of Spanish Haiti|lost control again]] in another rebellion. Shortly afterwards, Haitian forces [[Haitian occupation of Santo Domingo|again briefly controlled the entire island]], from 1822 to 1844. In 1844 the secret revolutionary movement called "La Trinitaria" took place and the Dominican Republic declared its independence defeating the Haitian forces. After several tumultuous decades, the Spanish [[Dominican Restoration War|briefly acquired nominal control]] of the Dominican Republic in the 1860s, setting off another war. By the late 19th century, over three hundred years of European control was ended; the modern history of [[Haiti#20th century|west Hispaniola (Haiti)]] and [[Dominican Republic#20th century|east Hispaniola (Dominican Republic)]] had begun.

===Under Trujillo: 1930s and 1940s===
''Antihaitianismo'' was strongly institutionalized during the regime of [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo]]. Border disputes under Trujillo culminated in the order of a military intervention and to massacre Haitians accused of practicing [[Haitian Vodou|vodou]] or [[witchery]], practices that were against the religious beliefs of the time. Claims range "from several hundred to 26,000"&lt;ref name="sagas2" /&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=May 2018}} or even "recorded as having a death toll reaching 30,000"&lt;ref name="Cambeira'96"&gt;{{cite book |first=Alan |last=Cambeira |title=Quisqueya la bella |edition=October 1996 |page=182 |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |isbn=1-56324-936-7}}  286 pages total.&lt;/ref&gt; in October 1937, an event subsequently named the [[Parsley Massacre]].  During later diplomacy, Trujillo agreed to pay hundreds of thousands in reparations,&lt;ref name="sagas2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sagás|first=Ernesto|title=An apparent contradiction?

Dominican intellectuals [[Manuel Arturo Peña Batlle]], [[Joaquín Balaguer]], [[Manuel de Jesús Troncoso de la Concha]], among others, led the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti/misctopic/dominican/antihaiti.htm|title=Haiti:  Antihaitianismo in Dominican Culture|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoy.com.do/la-agresion-contra-lescot/|title=La agresión contra Lescot|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present day: 1990s===
Trujillo's policies served to perpetuate antihaitianismo within the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref name="sagas2"/&gt;  In the 1996 Dominican presidential election, [[Joaquín Balaguer]] (historical leader of the [[Right-wing populism|populist Right]] and former right-hand of dictator [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo|Trujillo]]) united in a "National Patriotic Front" with PLD candidate [[Leonel Fernández]] in order to prevent [[José Francisco Peña Gómez|Peña Gómez]] from becoming President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/01/world/dominican-republic-holds-runoff-capping-fierce-race.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=Dominican Republic Holds Runoff, Capping Fierce Race | first=Larry | last=Rohter | date=1996-07-01 | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/43/051.html James Ferguson, Two Caudillos&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect|Car-jacked|the children's novel|Car-Jacked (novel)}}
'''Carjacking'''  is a [[robbery]] in which the item taken over is a motor vehicle.&lt;ref name="Cherbonneau"&gt;Michael Cherbonneau, "Carjacking," in ''Encyclopedia of Social Problems'', Vol. 1 (SAGE, 2008: ed. Vincent N. Parrillo), pp. 110-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word is a [[portmanteau]] of [[automobile|car]] and hijacking. The term was coined by EJ Mitchell, an editor with ''[[The Detroit News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pulitzer, Lisa Beth. Crime On Deadline. New York, New York: Boulevard Books, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; ''The News'' first used the term in a 1991 report on the murder of Ruth Wahl, a 22-year-old Detroit drugstore cashier who was killed when she would not surrender her [[Suzuki Sidekick]], and in an investigative report examining the rash of what Detroit Police call "robbery armed unlawful driving away an automobile" [in dispatch slang shortened to R.A.-YOU-Da] plaguing Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;''The Detroit News'', August 28, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
A study published in the ''[[British Journal of Criminology]]'' in 2003 found that "for all of the media attention it has received in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, carjacking remains an under-researched and poorly understood crime."&lt;ref name="Jacobs2003"&gt;Bruce A. Jacobs, Volkan Topalli &amp; Richard Wright, "Carjacking, Streetlife and Offender Motivation" in ''The British Journal of Criminology'', Vol. 43, Issue 4 (October 2003), pp. 673–688.&lt;/ref&gt; The study authors conducted [[semi-structured interview]]s with 28 active carjackers in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and based on these interviews concluded that "the decision to commit a carjacking stems most directly from a situated interaction between particular sorts of perceived opportunities and particular sorts of perceived needs and desires, this decision is activated, mediated, and shaped by participation in urban street culture."&lt;ref name="Jacobs2003"/&gt;

A study published in the ''[[Journal of Contemporary Ethnography]]'' in 2013 noted that "carjacking requires offenders to neutralize victims who are inherently mobile and who can use their vehicles as both weapons and shields." The study noted that carjackers use fear to compel compliance from victims.&lt;ref name="Jacobs2013"&gt;Bruce Jacobs, "The Manipulation of Fear in Carjacking" in ''Journal of Contemporary Ethnography'', Vol. 42, Issue 5 (February 2013), pp. 523-544.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2008 paper by the [[Australian Institute of Criminology]] conceptualized carjackings as falling into four types based on method and motive: organized and instrumental, organized and acquisitive, opportunistic and instrumental, and opportunistic and acquisitive. An example of an ''organized and instrumental'' carjacking is a planned carjacking with a weapon to use the vehicle for [[ram-raiding|ram an ATM to steal cash]]. An example of an ''organized and acquisitive'' carjacking is a planned carjacking to sell the vehicle in a known market. An example of an ''opportunistic and instrumental'' carjacking is a carjacking without a weapon to sell "vehicle/parts with no market in mind." An example of an ''opportunistic and acquisitive'' carjacking is a carjacking without a weapon to [[Joyride (crime)|joyride]].&lt;ref name="YoungBorzycki"&gt;Lisa Jane Young and Maria Borzycki, [http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/tandi/341-360/tandi351.html Carjacking in Australia: recording issues and future directions], ''Trends &amp; Issues in Crime &amp; Criminal Justice'', No. 351, [[Australian Institute of Criminology]], February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 qualitative study published in ''[[Justice Quarterly]]'' examined auto theft and carjacking in the context of "sanction threats" that promoted fear and influenced "crime preferences" among criminals, thereby redirecting ("channeling") criminal activity. The study showed that "auto thieves are reluctant to embrace the violence of carjacking due to concerns over sanction threat severity they attributed to carjacking—both formal (higher sentences) and informal (victim resistance and retaliation). Meanwhile, the carjackers are reticent to enact auto theft because of the more uncertain and putatively greater risk of being surprised by victims, a fear that appears to overcome the enhanced long-term formal penalty of taking a vehicle by force."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce A. Jacobs &amp; Michael Cherbonneau, "Perceived Sanction Threats and Projective Risk Sensitivity: Auto Theft, Carjacking, and the Channeling Effect," ''Justice Quarterly'' (March 2017), pp. 1-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention and response==
Common carjacking ruses include: (1) [[Traffic collision|bumping the victim's vehicle]] from behind, and taking the car when the victim gets out of the vehicle to assess damage and exchange information; (2) staging a fake car accident, sometimes with injuries, and stealing the vehicle of a passerby who stops to assist; (3) flashing lights or waving to get the victim's attention, indicating that there is a problem with the victim's car, and then taking the car once the victim pulls over; and (4) following a victim home, blocking the victim's car in a driveway or in front of a gate.&lt;ref name="Diplo"&gt;''[https://www.state.gov/m/ds/rls/rpt/19782.htm Carjacking&amp;mdash;Don't be a Victim]'', U.S. Department of State, [[Bureau of Diplomatic Security]] (August 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Police department]]s, security agencies, and [[Auto insurance|auto insurers]] have published lists of strategies for preventing and responding to carjackings.&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOLA"&gt;[http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2013/06/nopd_crime_prevention_how_to_a.html NOPD crime prevention: How to avoid being carjacked], [[New Orleans Police Department]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="III"&gt;[http://www.iii.org/article/preventing-carjacking-theft Preventing Carjacking / Theft], [[Insurance Information Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; Common recommendations include:
* Staying alert and being aware of one's surroundings&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOLA"/&gt;
* Parking in well-lighted areas&lt;ref name="NOLA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="III"/&gt;
* Keeping [[vehicle door]]s locked and [[car windows|windows]] up&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOLA"/&gt;
* Avoiding unfamiliar or high-crime areas&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOLA"/&gt;

===South Africa===
[[File:Hi-jacking hot spot.JPG|thumb|right|A sign in South Africa warning drivers]]
Carjacking is a significant problem in [[South Africa]], where it is called ''hijacking''.&lt;ref name="Caroll"&gt;Rory Caroll, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/02/film.oscars2006 Carjacking: the everyday ordeal testing South Africa], ''Guardian'' (March 2, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa is thought to have the highest carjacking rate in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Davis, [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1375/acri.36.2.173 Carjacking — Insights from South Africa to a New Crime Problem], '' Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Criminology'', Vol. 35, Issue 2, 2003, pp. 173-191.&lt;/ref&gt; There were 16,000 reported carjackings in 1998.&lt;ref name="Caroll"/&gt; The figures dropped to 12,434 reported carjackings in 2005,&lt;ref name="Caroll"/&gt; and continued to drop until the 2011-12, when the number of carjackings was 9,475, a record low.&lt;ref name="Conway-Smith"&gt;Erin Conway-Smith, [https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-05-27/carjackings-are-rise-again-south-africa Carjackings are on the rise again in South Africa], ''GlobalPost'' (May 27, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, however, carjackings increased as part of an overall increase in violent organized crime, which the [[Institute for Security Studies]] attributed to poor police leadership. There were 11,221 reported carjackings in 2014. More than half of all carjackings in South Africa occurred in [[Gauteng]] province, which includes [[Johannesburg]] and [[Pretoria]].&lt;ref name="Conway-Smith"/&gt; 

The carjacking issue in South Africa was depicted in the film ''[[Tsotsi]]'', which won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="Conway-Smith"/&gt; 

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, several new, unconventional [[anti-hijack system|anti-carjacking systems]] designed to harm the attacker were developed and marketed in South Africa, where carjacking had become endemic. Among these was the now defunct [[Blaster (flamethrower)|Blaster]], a small [[flame-thrower]] that could be mounted to the underside of a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/africa/9812/11/flame.thrower.car/|publisher=CNN|title=Flamethrower now an option on S. African cars|date=December 11, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
==== Federal Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992 ====

{{See also|Murder of Pam Basu}}

In 1992, Congress, in the aftermath of a spate of violent carjackings (including some in which the victims were murdered), passed the Federal Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992 (FACTA), the first federal carjacking law, making it a [[federal crime]] (punishable by 15 years to [[life imprisonment]]) to use a firearm to steal "through force or violence or intimidation" a motor vehicle that had been shipped through [[interstate commerce]].&lt;ref name="Cherbonneau"/&gt; The 1992 Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 2119, took effect on October 25, 1992.&lt;ref name="Folks"&gt;Mike Folks, [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-01-17/news/9401170203_1_federal-carjacking-law-carjacking-cases-pamela-basu Carjacking Law Getting Little Use: Few Prosecutions Occur Despite Increase in Number of Cases], ''Sun-Sentinel'' (January 17, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="18 U.S.C. § 2119"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2119 18 U.S.C. § 2119].&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a small number of federal prosecutions were imposed for carjacking the year after the act was enacted, in part because many federal carjacking cases were turned over to state prosecutions because they do not meet [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] criteria.&lt;ref name="Folks"/&gt; The Federal Death Penalty Act, part of the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994]], an omnibus crime bill, made sixty new federal crimes punishable by the [[Capital punishment by the United States federal government|federal death penalty]]; among these were the killing of a victim in the commission of carjacking.&lt;ref name="Cherbonneau"/&gt;&lt;ref name="18 U.S.C. § 2119"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amy D'Olivio, "Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act" in ''Encyclopedia of Law Enforcement'' (Sage, 2004: eds. Larry E. Sullivan et al.), p. 896.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 1993, articles about carjackings appeared at the rate of more than one a week in newspapers throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;"Carjacking Reports Increase In Area -- Police Told Of Five Incidents Over Thanksgiving Holiday." ''Seattle Times'', Saturday, November 26, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The November 29, 1992, killing of two [[Osceola County, Florida]] men by carjackers using a stolen [[9×19mm Parabellum|9 mm]] pistol resulted in the first federal prosecution of a fatal carjacking.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Pierson Curtis, [http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-01-30/news/9401300447_1_polk-county-bigger-gun-carjacking Youths Steal Guns To Steal Youths' Lives; The Gun Used In The Nation's First Federal Carjacking Case Was Bought Legally, Then Stolen], ''Orlando Sentinel'', January 30, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prevalence and statistical analysis====
According to the [[National Crime Victimization Survey]] (NCVS) conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice's [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], from 1993 to 2002, some 38,000 carjackings occurred annually.&lt;ref name="Klaus"&gt;Patsy Klaus, [http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/c02.pdf National Crime Victimization Survey, Carjacking, 1993-2002], U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the survey, over this time period men were more often victims than women, blacks more than whites, and Hispanics more than non-Hispanics.&lt;ref name="Klaus"/&gt; 56% of carjackers were identified by victims as black, 21% white, 16% Asian or Native American, and 7% mixed race or unknown.&lt;ref name="Klaus"/&gt; Some 93% of carjackings occurred in urban areas.&lt;ref name="Klaus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin S. Wright, Motor Vehicle Theft, in ''Encyclopedia of Street Crime in America'' (Sage 2010: ed. Jeffrey Ian Ross), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There were multiple carjackers in 56% of incidents, and the carjacker or carjackers were identified as male in 93% of incidents. A weapon was used in 74% of carjacking victimization: firearms in 45%, knives in 11%, and other weapons in 18%. Victims were injured in about 32% of completed carjackings and about 17% of attempted carjackings. Serious injuries, such as gunshot or knife wounds, broken bones, or internal injuries occurred in about 9% of incidents. About 14 murders a year involved car theft, but not all of these were carjackings. There were multiple carjackers in 56% of incidents, and the carjacker or carjackers were identified as male in 93% of incidents. Some 68% of carjackings occurred at nighttime hours (6 p.m. to 6 a.m.). Some 98% of completed carjackings and 77% of attempted carjackings were reported to police. About 44% of carjacking incidents occurred in an open area (e.g., on the street or near public transportation) while 24% occurred in parking lots or garages or near commercial places (e.g., stores, gas stations, office buildings, restaurants/bars).&lt;ref name="Klaus"/&gt;

According to the NCVS, from 1992 and 1996, about 49,000 completed or attempted nonfatal carjackings took place each year in the United States. The carjacking was successful in about half of incidents. Data on fatal carjackings are not available; "about 27 homicides by strangers each year involved automobile theft," but not all of these were carjackings.&lt;ref name="Klaus2"&gt;Patsy Klaus, [http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cus96.pdf Carjackings in the United States, 1992-96], .S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, March 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In particular cities====
Carjackings were common in [[Newark, New Jersey]], in the 1990s, and a wave of carjackings took place again in 2010.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;Associated Press, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/nyregion/22carjack.html After Dozens of Arrests, Newark Carjackings Decline Sharply], March 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There were 288 carjackings in the city in 2010 (a 70% increase from the previous year), and [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]] (which includes Newark) had 69 in December 2010 alone.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; The Associated Press reported that "unlike previous carjackings, in which thieves would strip vehicles for parts or sell them in other states, the recent wave perplexed law enforcement officials because almost all appeared to be done by thrill-seeking young men who would steal the cars for a few hours, drive them around and then abandon them."&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; After federal, state, and law enforcement agencies formed a task force, 42 suspects were charged, and carjackings dropped dramatically.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; However, national media attention on carjackings in Essex County returned in December 2013, when a [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]] lawyer was murdered at [[The Mall at Short Hills]] in [[Millburn, New Jersey]], while defending his wife from four assailants,&lt;ref&gt;Marc Santora &amp; Annie Correaldec, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/nyregion/carjacking-victim-at-new-jersey-mall-dies.html Man Dies in Carjacking at Short Hills Mall; 2 Suspects Are Sought], ''New York Times'', December 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schwirtzdec, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/nyregion/4-suspects-held-in-deadly-carjacking-at-new-jersey-mall.html 4 Suspects Held in Fatal Carjacking at Mall], ''New York Times'', December 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/22/us/ap-us-shooting-nj-mall.html 4 Men Plead Not Guilty in Deadly Mall Carjacking], October 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; who were all later convicted of the crime.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Jongsma, [http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/crime/2017/10/10/two-men-plead-guilty-roles-fatal-short-hills-mall-carjacking/751683001/ Two men plead guilty to roles in fatal Short Hills mall carjacking], ''NorthJersey.com'' (October 10, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

The major U.S. city with the highest rates of carjacking is [[Detroit]].&lt;ref name="Baldas"&gt;Tresa Baldas, [http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2014/11/30/detroit-police-fight-carjacking-crime/19671313/ Carjackers losing grip on Detroit, but strike daily], ''Detroit Free Press'' (November 30, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Detroit had 1,231 carjackings, more than three a day.&lt;ref name="Baldas"/&gt; By 2013, that number had fallen to 701, but this was still the highest known number of carjackings for any major city in the country.&lt;ref name="Baldas"/&gt;  The significant decrease in carjackings was credited to a coordinated effort by the [[Detroit Police Department]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and the [[United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan|local federal prosecutor's office]].&lt;ref name="Baldas"/&gt;  Serial carjackers were targeted for federal prosecutions and longer sentences, and in 2009 the Detroit Police Department centralized all carjacking investigations and developed a suspect profiling system.&lt;ref name="Baldas"/&gt; Through mid-November 2014, Detroit had 486 carjackings, down 31% from the year before, but this was still three times more than the carjackings experienced by [[New York City]] (which has ten times Detroit's population) in all of 2013.&lt;ref name="Baldas"/&gt; Even James Craig, [[chief of police]] of the [[Detroit Police Department]], was the victim of an attempted carjacking while he was in his [[police cruiser]].&lt;ref name="Baldas"/&gt;

A 2017 study used "Risk Terrain Modeling" analysis to identify spatial indicators of carjacking risk in Detroit. The analysis identified six factors that "were influential in the best fitting model: proximity to service stations; convenience/grocery/[[liquor store]]s; bus stops; residential and commercial demolitions; and areas with high concentrations of drug arrests and restaurants." The study found that certain locations in Detroit "had an expected rate of carjacking that was 278 times higher than other locations."&lt;ref&gt;Kim Michelle Lersch, [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235217302891 Risky places: An analysis of carjackings in Detroit], ''Journal of Criminal Justice'', Vol. 52 (September 2017), pp. 34-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

====State law====
Some states have a specific carjacking statute. Other states do not have a specific carjacking law, and prosecute carjackers under the general robbery statute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/print/cj/fslautotheftpptchart.pdf Auto Theft &amp; Carjacking State Statutes], National Conference of State Legislators (last accessed November 25, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

The law of some states, such as [[Louisiana]], explicitly lists a killing in the course of defending oneself against forcible entry of an occupied motor vehicle as a [[justifiable homicide]].&lt;ref name="Cherbonneau"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://articles.latimes.com/1997/aug/14/news/mn-22319 Louisiana Drivers Given License to Kill] (August 14, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Michelle Gerlin, [http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1005&amp;context=law_urbanlaw Louisiana's New "Kill the Carjacker" Statute: Self-Defense or Instant Injustice?], 55 Wash. U. J. Urb. &amp; Contemp. L. 10, (January 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Carjacking is an uncommon crime in Britain, making up about 1% of all vehicle thefts.&lt;ref name="YoungBorzycki"/&gt;

===Australia===
Australia does not specifically record the number of carjackings; such crimes are variously recorded as assault, robbery, motor vehicle theft, and some combination. However, a 2008 paper by the [[Australian Institute of Criminology]], analyzing police and insurance records, suggested that fewer than 300 carjackings occur annually in Australia (about 0.5% of all theft incidents in the country).&lt;ref name="YoungBorzycki"/&gt; The paper noted that the low incidence of carjacking compared to the United States is attributable to the low overall of firearm-related crime overall in Australia and  the fact that the "broader socioeconomic picture of Australian society is one of relative good health in terms of wealth distribution and social cohesion" providing little motivation for victimization that is "both personal and violent."&lt;ref name="YoungBorzycki"/&gt; The paper notes that although carjacking was rare, isolated hot spots do arise occasionally, and that since the late 1990s, "[Sydney]] has experienced a number of carjacking clusters ... each lasting around three to six months and occurring in different locations including the eastern suburbs, the inner city and the south-west."&lt;ref name="YoungBorzycki"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70077">A '''citizen's arrest''' is an [[arrest]] made by a person who is not acting as a [[oath|sworn]] [[Police officer|law-enforcement official]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=va&amp;vol=1022703&amp;invol=1 |title=HUDSON v. COMMONWEALTH, Record No. 022703., September 12, 2003 - VA Supreme Court - FindLaw |publisher=FindLaw |year= 2009 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[common law]] jurisdictions, the practice dates back to medieval [[Kingdom of England|England]] and the [[English common law]], in which [[sheriff]]s encouraged ordinary [[Citizenship|citizen]]s to help apprehend [[criminal|law breakers]].

Despite the practice's name, in most countries, the arresting person is usually designated as a ''person'' with arrest powers, who need not be a ''citizen'' of the country in which they are acting. For example, in the [[United Kingdom|British]] jurisdiction of [[England and Wales]], the power comes from section 24A(2) of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/24A |title=Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 |publisher=The National Archives, UK |date=16 Aug 2011 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; called "any person arrest". This [[legislation]] states "any person" has these powers, and does not state that they need to be a [[British nationality law|British citizen]].

==Legal and political aspects==
A person who makes a citizen's arrest could risk exposing him or herself to possible [[lawsuit]]s or [[criminal charge]]s &amp;ndash; such as charges of [[false imprisonment]], [[unlawful restraint]], [[kidnapping]], or [[wrongful arrest]] &amp;ndash; if the wrong person is apprehended or a suspect's [[civil rights]] are violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REGINA -V- SELF; CACD 25 FEB 1992|url=http://swarb.co.uk/regina-v-self-cacd-25-feb-1992/|website=SWARB.CO.UK|publisher=SWARB.CO.UK|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true when [[police force]]s are attempting to determine who an [[aggression|aggressor]] is. Private citizens don’t enjoy the same immunity from civil liability when making arrests on other private citizens as police officers.

The level of responsibility that a person performing a citizen's arrest may bear depends on the jurisdiction. For instance, in [[France]] and [[Germany]], a person stopping a criminal from committing a crime, including crimes against belongings, is not [[criminal responsibility|criminally responsible]] as long as the means employed are in proportion to the threat. Note, however, that in both countries, this results from a different legal norm, "aid to others in immediate danger", which is concerned with prevention, not [[prosecution]], of crimes.

==Laws by country==

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the power to arrest is granted by both [[Government of Australia|federal]] and [[States and Territories of Australia|state]] legislation, however the exact power granted differs depending on jurisdiction. The power to arrest for a Federal offence is granted by s.3Z of the [[Crimes Act 1914|''Crimes Act'' 1914]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legislation.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/ActCompilation1.nsf/0/612E850EF1814DE9CA257344000972EE/$file/CrimesAct1914Vol1_WD02.pdf |title=ComLaw Home |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |date=1 Oct 2012 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Act, a [[person (law)|person]] who is not a [[police constable]] may, without [[warrant (law)|warrant]], arrest another person if they believe on [[reasonable suspicion|reasonable grounds]] that:

*the other person is committing or has just committed an [[indictable offence]]; and
*proceedings by [[summons]] against the other person would not: ensure the appearance of the person before a court in respect of the offence; prevent a repetition or continuation of the offence or the commission of another offence; prevent the concealment, loss or destruction of evidence relating to the offence; prevent harassment of, or interference with, a person who may be required to give evidence in proceedings in respect of the offence; prevent the fabrication of evidence in respect of the offence; or would not preserve the safety or welfare of the person.

A person who arrests another person must, as soon as practicable after the arrest, arrange for the other person, and any property found on the other person, to be delivered into the custody of a constable.

====Victoria====
In the Australian state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the power to arrest is granted in section 458 of the ''[[Crimes Act 1958]]'' (Vic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ca195882/ |title=Crimes Act 1958 |publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute |date=20 Apr 2014 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that a person may, without a [[warrant (law)|warrant]], arrest a person that they find committing an offence for one or more of the following reasons:
*to ensure the appearance of the offender in court, and/or
*to preserve public order, and/or
*to prevent the continuation or repetition of the offence, or the commission of a further offence, and/or
*for the safety or welfare of the public or the offender

A person may also arrest another person if they are instructed to do so by a member of the police force, or if they believe on reasonable grounds that the offender is escaping legal custody.

Section 461 states that if an arrest is made under 458 of the Crimes Act, and is later proven to be false, then the arrest itself won't be considered unlawful if it was made on reasonable grounds. Section 462A allows any person the right to use force "not disproportionate to the objective as he believes on reasonable grounds to be necessary to prevent the commission, continuance or completion of an indictable offence or to effect or assist in effecting the lawful arrest of a person committing or suspected of committing any offence".

====New South Wales====
In the [[Australia]]n state of [[New South Wales]], the power to arrest is granted to anyone who is not a [[police officer]] by s.100 of the ''Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalaid.nsw.gov.au/publications/factsheets-and-resources/police-powers |title=Police powers - Legal Aid NSW |publisher=NSW Government |date=15 Nov 2013 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of New South Wales. Under the Act, a person may, without a [[warrant (law)|warrant]], arrest another person if:
*the person is in the act of committing an [[offence (law)|offence]] under any Act or statutory instrument, or
*the person has just committed any such offence, or
*the person has committed a serious indictable offence for which the person has not been [[trial|tried]].

Section 231 of the Act allows the use of such force as is "reasonably necessary to make the arrest or to prevent the escape of the person after arrest". A person who arrests another person under s.100 must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, take the person, and any [[personal property|property]] found on the person, before a [[magistrate]] to be dealt with according to law. The [[magistrate]] will also decide whether or not the force applied in making the arrest was reasonable under the circumstances.

According to the [[Law Society of New South Wales]], the arresting person should:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawsociety.com.au |title=Homepage - Law Society of NSW |publisher=The Law Society of New South Wales |year=2009 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*inform the person that they are under arrest and
*inform the person of the reasons for the arrest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawsociety.com.au/community/publicationsandfaqs/legalquestions/Underarrest/025900 |title=Law Society of New South Wales - Under arrest? |publisher=Law Society of New South Wales |date=(?)2009 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220170852/http://www.lawsociety.com.au/community/publicationsandfaqs/legalquestions/Underarrest/025900 |archivedate=February 20, 2014 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Queensland====
In the [[Australia]]n state of [[Queensland]], the power to arrest is granted by s.546 of Schedule 1 to the ''Criminal Code Act 1899'' of Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/C/CriminCode.pdf |title=Criminal Code Act 1899 - CriminCode.pdf |publisher=Government of Queensland, Australia |date=27 Nov 2013 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Act, any person who [[in flagrante delicto|finds another committing]] an [[offence (law)|offence]] may, without [[warrant (law)|warrant]], arrest the other person. The power to arrest in Queensland also allows for arrest on suspicion of an offence:
{{quote|If the offence has been actually committed--it is lawful for any person who believes on reasonable ground that another person has committed the offence to arrest that person without warrant, whether that other person has committed the offence or not.}}

s.260 of the Act also provides a power to arrest in preventing a [[breach of the peace]]:
{{quote|It is lawful for any person who witnesses a breach of the peace to interfere to prevent the continuance or renewal of it, and to use such force as is reasonably necessary for such prevention and is reasonably proportioned to the danger to be apprehended from such continuance or renewal, and to detain any person who is committing or who is about to join in or to renew the breach of the peace for such time as may be reasonably necessary in order to give the person into the custody of a police officer.}}

====South Australia====
The Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (s271)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/clca1935262/s271.html |title=South Australia Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 Section 271 |publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute |date=1 Jan 2014 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; grants arrest powers to a person in [[South Australia]].

{{quote|s271(3): A person is liable to arrest and detention under this section if the person is in the act of committing, or has just committed an indictable offence; or theft (whether the theft is a summary or indictable offence); or an offence against the person (whether the offence is summary or indictable); or an offence involving interference with, [[vandalism|damage]] to or destruction of property (whether the offence is summary or indictable).}}

====Tasmania====
Under the Police Offences Act 1935 ([[Tasmania]]), section 55(3), any person may arrest any other person whom they find committing an offence, where they have reasonable grounds to believe that the conduct will create or may involve substantial injury to another person, serious danger of such injury, loss of property or serious injury to property. Section 55(5) states "For the purposes of this section, a person is said to be 'found offending' if he does any act, or makes any omission, or conducts or behaves himself, and thereby causes a person who finds him reasonable grounds for believing that he has, in respect of such act, omission, or conduct, committed an offence against this Act." There are further provisions in section 301 of the Criminal Code Act 1924 (Tas) that appear to allow a sliding scale of force in executing an arrest.

====Western Australia====
It was only in 2004 that the [[Western Australia]]n parliament repealed the provisions of the former section 47 of the Police Act 1892 which allowed any person to arrest without a warrant "any reputed common [[prostitute]], [[thief]], loose, idle or [[disorderly conduct|disorderly person]], who, within view of such person apprehending, shall offend against this Act, and shall forthwith deliver him to any constable or police officer of the place where he shall have been apprehended, to be taken and conveyed before a Justice, to be dealt with according to law …" A private citizen would have found it rather difficult to interpret the terms "loose" or "idle" with any degree of [[legal certainty]]. WA now locates its citizen's arrest powers in section 25 of the Criminal Investigation Act (WA) 2006.

====The Territories====
;[[Northern Territory]]: Under section 441(2) of the Criminal Code of the Northern Territory, any person can arrest another whom he or she finds committing an offence or behaving such that he or she believes on reasonable grounds that the offender has committed an offence and that an arrest is necessary for a range of specified reasons.
;[[Australian Capital Territory]]: refer to the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT), section 218, which permits a citizen's arrest.

Generally speaking, as regards the law in Australia: where it is clear on the evidence that a private citizen, or [[security guard|security officer]], in detaining a suspect, acted reasonably and the suspect unreasonably, then it is likely that the court will find in favour of the citizen or security officer and against the suspect if that suspect chooses, later, to sue the citizen for assault or false imprisonment. In other circumstances where, e.g., a property owner (or an agent) arrests a thief in a manner, and in circumstances, disproportionate to the likely harm to the victim, and in clear defiance of the rights of the suspect (for example, to be taken forthwith to a police station), then the court is very likely to find in favour of the suspect (guilty or otherwise). The courts may order [[restitution|compensation]] for such suspects in appropriate circumstances.

===Brazil===
In [[Brazil]], a Federal law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jusbrasil.com.br/legislacao/anotada/2341030/art-301-do-codigo-processo-penal-decreto-lei-3689-41 |title=Art. 301 do Código Processo Penal - Decreto Lei 3689/41 |language=pt |publisher=Jusbrasil.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows any person to arrest a suspect criminal found in flagrante delicto or fleeing from the crime scene. The person has to, at his/her own judgment, have the physical power to keep the suspect detained, has to verbally explain what he/she is doing to the arrestee and has to call the police. Both have to wait for the arrival of the police. The person who makes a citizen's arrest has to sign the police forms as a witness and explain the facts. Typically it will lead to a time burden of at least two hours. If the facts cannot be verified the person who realizes the citizen's arrest might be sued by the arrestee.

===Canada===

====Federal law====
[[Canada]]'s blanket arrest authorities for crimes or violations of federal statutes are found in the Criminal Code. In Canada, a criminal offence is any offence that is created by a [[Federal Government of Canada|federal]] statute—there are no provincial "crimes".

Criminal offences are divided into three groups: indictable, dual procedure, and summary conviction. For the purposes of arrest, dual procedure offences are considered to be indictable.

The Criminal Code provisions related to citizen arrests were changed in 2012, by the Citizen's Arrest and Self-defence Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/AnnualStatutes/2012_9/FullText.html |title=Citizen’s Arrest and Self-defence Act |publisher=Laws-lois.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, it is now possible to make a citizen's arrest in Canada in circumstances where a "reasonable" amount of time has lapsed between the commission of a property-related offence and the arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/news-nouv/nr-cp/2013/doc_32865.html |title=Backgrounder: Citizen's Power of Arrest and Self-Defence and Defence of Property |publisher=Justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060656/http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/news-nouv/nr-cp/2013/doc_32865.html |archivedate=2013-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Provincial law====
There are several arrest authorities found through the various provincial statutes. The most notable citizen's arrest authority in Ontario is found in the Trespass to Property Act, but there are others found in the Highway Traffic Act, the Liquor Licence Act, and many others.

===Denmark===
In [[Denmark]], pursuant to § 755 (2) of the Administration of Justice Act, anyone may arrest a suspect found at or in the immediate vicinity of a crime scene if the criminal act is subject to public prosecution. The arrestee must as soon as possible be turned over to the police with information about the time of and reasons for the arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=138875#Kap69 |title=Retsplejeloven - Bekendtgørelse af lov om rettens pleje (in Dansk/Danish)- English: Administration of Justice Act - Act on Administration of Justice- retsinformation.dk |publisher=retsinformation.dk |date=24 October 2012 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
In [[Finland]], [http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2011/20110806 Coercive Measures Act 22.7.2011/806] gives a right to apprehend someone in the act of committing a crime ''([[in flagrante delicto]])'' or fleeing from the crime scene, if punishment for the crime might be imprisonment or the crime is petty assault, petty theft, petty embezzlement, petty unauthorized use, petty stealing of a motor vehicle for temporary use, petty damage to property or petty fraud. A person wanted by the police (arrest warrant) can be apprehended by anyone. After the apprehension, the detainee must be handed over to the police as soon as possible. If the criminal is resisting or tries to escape, the law gives a citizen the right to use an amount of force considered necessary, when considering the nature of the crime, the behavior of the apprehended and the situation as a whole.

===France===
[[French law]] allows any person to arrest a person having been caught ''[[in flagrante delicto]]'' committing a crime punishable by a jail or prison term, and to conduct that person before the nearest officer of judiciary police &amp;ndash; in modern practice, one would rather call the police in after performing the arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006575113&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071154&amp;dateTexte=20100705&amp;oldAction=rechCodeArticle Code of penal procedure (France), Article 73].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Citizen's arrests can be made under §&amp;nbsp;127&amp;nbsp;Ⅰ&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;StPO (code of penal procedures) if the arrestee is caught ''[[in flagrante delicto]]'' and either the identity of the person cannot be otherwise established immediately or he/she is suspected to try to flee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/englisch_stpo/englisch_stpo.html#p1053 §&amp;nbsp;127&amp;nbsp;StPO (code of penal procedures) (Germany)].&lt;/ref&gt; The person making the arrest is allowed to hold the arrestee solely for the purpose of turning him over to a proper legal authority such as the police. German law does not establish that the crime has to be serious, nor that the person making the arrest has to actually be a citizen of Germany.

===[[Hong Kong]]===
Citizen's arrest is known as the "101 power". Under the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (cap. 221 of the Laws of Hong Kong), section 101(2) provides that "Any person may arrest without warrant any person whom he may reasonably suspect of being guilty of an arrestable offence" using "force as is [[reasonable person|reasonable]] and proportionate in the circumstances" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201411/26/P201411260507.htm |title=Reply by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, in the Legislative Council|website=news.gov.hk}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. Once an arrest is made, the suspect must be delivered to a police office as soon as possible for court proceedings. "Arrestable offence" is defined as any crimes that can be sentenced for more than 12 months of jail time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap221/s101 Criminal Procedure Ordinance (Hong Kong), Chapter 221, Section 101].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
According to article 127, section 3 of ''Act XIX. of 1998 concerning Penal Procedure'', anyone may arrest a person caught committing a felony, but is obliged to hand the person over to the "investigative authorities" immediately; if this is not possible, the police must be informed.

===India===
Section 43, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 states that:
{{Quotation|
#Any private person may arrest or cause to be arrested any person who in his presence commits a non-bailable and cognizable offence, or any proclaimed offender, and, without unnecessary delay, shall make over or cause to be made over any person so arrested to a police officer, or, in the absence of a police officer, take such person or cause him to be taken in custody to the nearest police station.
#If there is a reason to believe that such person comes under the [provisions of Sec 41, a police officer shall re-arrest him.
#If there is a reason to believe that he has committed a non-cognizable offence, and he refuses on the demand of the police officer to give his name and residence, or gives name or residence which such officer has a reason to believe to be false, he shall be dealt with under the provisions of Sec 42, but if there is no sufficient reason to believe that he has committed any offence he shall at once be released.}}

===Israel===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}
{{wikisourcelang|he|חוק סדר הדין הפלילי (סמכויות אכיפה – מעצרים)}}
An [[Israel]]i law allowing anyone to arrest a suspect whom they witnessed carrying out a felony was repealed in 1996 and a new law now allows the detention of a suspect by another person under certain conditions. Section 75 of the Criminal Procedure Law (Enforcement Powers – Arrest) of 1996 allows anyone to detain a person who is witnessed carrying out certain suspected crimes. The crimes include the following: a felony, theft, a crime of violence and a crime which has caused serious damage to property. A person using these detention powers may use reasonable force if their request is not met as long as they do not cause the suspect bruising. They must hand the suspect over to the police immediately and no later than three hours. Persons whose identity is known or who are not suspected of fleeing may not be detained. The law, which is relatively new, is used by both private individuals and private security but is problematic because it has not yet been interpreted by the courts. In early 2009, a magistrate's court in Jerusalem handed down a verdict convicting two private security officers of assault following a detention of a suspect who assaulted one of them. The court ruled that the guards were not allowed to detain the suspect who was seated in a taxi at the time and should have waited for the police to arrive.

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], Section 213 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows anyone (not only citizens) witnessing any crime in progress to make an arrest. This is called ''genkouhan'' (現行犯, meaning ''[[in flagrante delicto]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[wikibooks:ja:刑事訴訟法第213条]]&lt;/ref&gt; Most criminals who attempt to flee, or refuse to identify themselves, can be held until police arrive.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikibooks:ja:刑事訴訟法第217条]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, making a citizen's arrest to prevent [[petty crime]] (e.g. illegal assembly, accidental injury, accidental trespass, defamation of character, leaving a parking lot without paying)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanteisha.net/taiho.html |title=現行犯逮捕 |publisher=Tanteisha.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is [[false imprisonment]] per Section 220 of the Criminal Code.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikibooks:ja:刑事訴訟法第220条]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latvia===
[http://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=107820#p-457809 Criminal Procedure Law] in [[Latvia]] gives a right to any person to apprehend someone in the act of committing a crime ''([[in flagrante delicto]])'' or fleeing from the crime scene, if punishment for the crime might be imprisonment. Also a person wanted by the police, for whom there is an arrest warrant, can be arrested by anyone at any time. A person stopping a criminal from committing a crime is not criminally responsible [http://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=88966&amp;version_date=01.01.2007#p-9227 as long as the means employed are in proportion to the threat].

Sub-section 5 further allows the arrest of a person who commits an offence on or with respect to the property of another by any person who is using the property to which the injury is done, or by the servant of either of those persons or by any person authorized by or acting in aid of either of those persons:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agc.gov.my/agc/oth/Akta/Vol.%2012/Act%20593.pdf Criminal Procedure Code (Act 593) &amp;sect; 27(5)]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 16 of the 1917 [[Constitution of Mexico]] allows any person to arrest a criminal found ''[[in flagrante delicto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilstu.edu/class/hist263/docs/1917const.html Constitution of Mexico, Article 16] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303014932/http://www.ilstu.edu/class/hist263/docs/1917const.html |date=March 3, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; A non-police officer doing so must immediately call the police, because it is illegal to retain or transport any person against their will; failing to do so is illegal deprivation of liberty, a crime similar to kidnapping that can result in a prison sentence for the perpetrator. In 2006, the celebrity bounty hunter [[Duane Chapman|Duane 'Dog' Chapman]] was charged with unlawful deprivation of liberty for arresting an American fugitive in Mexico and attempting to take him across the border to California without consulting police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/09/19/duane-dog-chapman-says-feds-sold-him-out-to-mexico-in-exchange-for-drug-lord/ |title=Duane 'Dog' Chapman Says Feds Sold Him Out to Mexico in Exchange for Drug Lord |publisher=Fox News |date=2006-09-19 |accessdate=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New Zealand]], some legal protection exists to those making a citizen's arrest as provided in the [[Crimes Act 1961]] in that there may be justification or protection from criminal responsibility. Justification of the arrest ensures the arresting person is not guilty of an offence and is not liable to any [[civil procedure|civil proceeding]]. Protection from criminal responsibility means those who make the arrest are not liable to any criminal proceedings. They are however liable for [[civil procedure|civil proceedings]]. The legislation is carefully worded and only applies to offences covered in the Crimes Act 1961, not other offences such as those covered in the [[Summary Offences Act 1981]].&lt;ref name="ns.org.nz"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ns.org.nz/index.html/Factsheets/CitizensArrestAndSelf-defence?action=pdf |title=Citizen's Arrest and Self-defence |accessdate=2010-10-08 | publisher = Neighbourhood Support New Zealand |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, the [[Crimes Act 1961]] states that everyone (not just New Zealand citizens) is justified in arresting without warrant:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM328250.html?search=ts_act_crimes+act#DLM328250 Crimes Act 1961, Section 35 &amp; 36].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Any person found committing any offence against this Act which the maximum punishment is not less than 3 years' imprisonment; or
* Any person found at night (9pm till 6am) committing any offence against this Act.

Other situations where members of the public are protected from criminal responsibility when involved in arresting where:
* They have been asked by a police officer to help arrest any person believed or suspected to have committed any offence unless they know that there is no reasonable ground for the belief or suspicion.&lt;ref name="ns.org.nz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM328250.html?search=ts_act_crimes+act#DLM328250 Crimes Act 1961, Section 34].&lt;/ref&gt;
* They witness a breach of the peace, and therefore are justified in interfering to prevent its continuance or renewal, and may detain any person committing it, in order to hand them over to a police officer provided that the person interfering does not use more force than is reasonably necessary to prevent the continuance or renewal of the breach of the peace, or than is reasonably proportionate to the danger to be apprehended from its continuance or renewal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM328261.html?search=ts_act_crimes+act#DLM328261 Crimes Act 1961, Section 42].&lt;/ref&gt; Similar legislation applies to suppressions of riots by members of the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM328262.html?search=ts_act_crimes+act#DLM328262 Crimes Act 1961, Section 43].&lt;/ref&gt;
* They believe, on reasonable and probable grounds, someone has committed an offence against the Crimes Act 1961 and is fleeing and is being pursued by any one they believe can arrest that person for the offence (such as a police officer). This applies whether or not the offence has in fact been committed, and whether or not the arrested person committed it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM328253.html?search=ts_act_crimes+act#DLM328253 Crimes Act 1961, Section 38].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The person making the arrest is entitled to perform a search on the suspect, provided he/she is not working for the place of arrest (e.g. a security guard in a hospital).

In all cases a person making a citizens arrest must hand over the suspect to a police officer at the earliest possible time.

===Norway===
In [[Norway]], pursuant to § 176 of the Criminal Procedure Act any person may arrest a suspect caught at the scene or pursued from it. The arrestee must be handed over to the police immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lovdata.no/all/tl-19810522-025-021.html#176].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
Although the [[Philippines]] does not have a national law covering citizen's arrest, the local government of [[Quezon City]] passed ''Ordinance 2307'' or the "Citizen's Arrest Ordinance of Quezon City". Any citizens within the Quezon City area can arrest a person even without a warrant in the instances mentioned and provided by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJkEuaEQtW4|title=QC ordinance allows 'citizen's arrest'|first=|last=ABS-CBN News|date=1 November 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
In [[Sweden]], any person may arrest someone in the act of committing a crime, or fleeing from the crime scene, if the crime committed is punishable by imprisonment. A person wanted by the police, for whom there is an arrest warrant, can be arrested by anyone at any time. After the arrest, the police must be contacted as soon as possible.

===Taiwan===
An arrest without a warrant is explicitly forbidden by the Article 8 in the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]], "except in case of flagrante delicto as provided by law", as shown below:

{{poemquote|
'''The Code of Criminal Procedure'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawSearchNo.aspx?PC=C0010001&amp;DF=&amp;SNo=88].&lt;/ref&gt;
''Article 88: Arrest without a Warrant''
{{unbulleted list
|A person in flagrante delicto may be arrested without a warrant by any person.
|A person in flagrante delicto is a person who is discovered in the act of committing an offense or immediately thereafter.
|A person is considered to be in flagrante delicto under one of the following circumstances:
{{unbulleted list
|'''(1)''' One is pursued with cries that he is an offender;
|'''(2)''' One is found in possession of a weapon, stolen property, or other items sufficient to warrant a suspicion that he is an offender or his body, clothes and the like show traces of the commission of an offense sufficient to warrant such suspicion.
}}
}}
}}

However, the first additional circumstance, i.e. "pursued with cries" has been considered ambiguous in recent years, leading to many ongoing discussions and controversies of whether this would cause an infringement of the personal freedom.

===Turkey===

[[Turkey|Turkish]] Criminal Procedure Code states:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislationline.org/download/action/download/id/4257/file/Turkey_CPC_2009_en.pdf Turkish Criminal Procedure Code]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
'''Article 90''' – (1) In the instances listed below, any individual is entitled to make an arrest of another person temporarily without a warrant:
{{unbulleted list

|b) If the other person was under pursuit after committing an offense, if there is the possibility of escape of the person under pursuit after committing an offense or, if the establishment of his identity right away is not possible.}}
}}

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
A citizen's arrest is permitted to be made on any person under section 24A of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] for an [[indictable offence]], including [[either way]] offences (in this section referred to simply as "an offence"), but excluding certain specific ones listed below; the Ministry of Justice publishes a list of indictable offences on its website.&lt;ref&gt;Indictable offences, summary offences, and TEW offences - court codes https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/217713/offence-classifications.xls&lt;/ref&gt;. A few examples of [[indictable]] and [[either-way]] offences are [[theft]], [[criminal damage]], [[burglary]], [[assault]] occasioning [[actual bodily harm]], possession of an [[offensive weapon]] in a public place, etc.
It is thus permissible for any person to arrest another without warrant&lt;ref&gt;https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/24A&lt;/ref&gt;:

*anyone who is in the act of committing an offence, or whom the arrestor has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be in the act of committing an offence, or
*where an offence has been committed, anyone who is guilty of that offence or whom the arrestor has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be guilty of it

In order for the citizen's arrest to be lawful, the following two conditions must also be satisfied:

*it appears to the person making the arrest that it is not reasonably practicable for a Constable to make the arrest instead;
*the arrestor has reasonable grounds for believing that the arrest is ''necessary'' to prevent one or more of the following:
**the person causing physical injury to himself or others;
**the person suffering physical injury;
**the person causing loss of or damage to property;
**the person absconding before a constable can assume responsibility for him

Use of the second power above ("where an offence has been committed") is more limited than the first as it relies upon the person carrying out the arrest ''knowing'' that an (indictable) offence ''has been'' committed. It is a common misconception that a member of the public needs to witness the offence before being able to act. Section 24 of this act therefore gives a Constable two key additional powers:

*Anyone who is (without doubt) about to commit an offence, or whom the Constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be about to commit an offence;
*Anyone whom the Constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be guilty of an offence which is merely ''suspected'' to have taken place

A Constable's arrest power is not limited to indictable offences, and a necessity test different from the above applies.

However, a citizen's arrest cannot be made:

A person cannot normally make a citizen's arrest before an offence takes place (excluding any indictable offence covered by the Criminal Attempts Act 1981), but they may prevent the commission of further offences at the time e.g. a person arrested to cease ''further'' criminal damage. However, Section 3 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]] allows any person to use [[reasonable force]] for the prevention of crime. This would not allow a citizen's arrest before an offence takes place in this sense but would allow any person to use reasonable force to prevent an offence from occurring; for example, restraining a suspected offender who raised a brick in their hand in order to imminently smash a window.

"Any person" powers can be used to arrest ''before'' an offence occurs as long as the offence in question falls within the [[Criminal Attempts Act 1981]]. This act creates the offence of an ''attempted'' offence, as long as the offence being attempted is an [[indictable]] one. For this to apply, the offence must actually be in the process of being attempted &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32; preparatory steps are not sufficient. For example, putting gloves on to smash a car window would not suffice, but the throwing of a brick at the window would. The definition of what constitutes a "crime" was clarified in R v Jones (Margaret)[2005] QB 259&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd060329/jones-3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
which stated under the S3 CLA1967 meaning, it was held to be any domestic crime in England/Wales. Kent Police have released a brief yet comprehensive [http://library.college.police.uk/docs/APPref/use-of-force-briefing.pdf guide] on reasonable force&lt;ref&gt;http://library.college.police.uk/docs/APPref/use-of-force-briefing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that a citizen's arrest is a form of [[lawful custody]] and anyone attempting to flee may be guilty of attempting to [[escape from lawful custody]]. Furthermore, the offence of 'assault with intent to resist arrest or lawful apprehension or detainer of himself' may apply if the arrestee assaulted the arrestor under Section 38 of the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1861]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/38&lt;/ref&gt;. Both assault with intent to resist arrest/lawful apprehension and escaping from lawful custody are indictable, the former being so by the mode of trial of the offence, the latter is a [[common law]] offence and therefore [[indictable]] only. Therefore, these offences - whether fully carried out or merely attempted - are citizen's arrestable in themselves.

(See also - [[Criminal Attempts Act 1981]])

In addition to the above, a private person may be authorised to execute an [[arrest warrant]], if the [[court]] issuing the warrant has given them the authority to do so.

A citizen's arrest may also be made technically for a warrant for an arrest if the offence listed is indictable as there is no law prohibiting a re-citizen's arrest or the number of times they may be arrested for it nor is there a time limit. The warrant would satisfy the requirement for the arrester to have reasonable grounds to suspect the guilt of the arrestee. For example, if an offender failed to attend [[Crown court]] this would satisfy two conditions for a lawful citizen's arrest at a later date - that the offence ''had'' taken place and that it was obviously indictable by way of being tried in Crown court.

=====Other Powers=====

Although not technically citizen's arrest powers, any person also has the power to arrest for a [[common law]] [[breach of the peace]] which also provides any person with a [[power of entry]]. Section 3 [[Criminal Justice Act 1967]] provides any person the power to apprehend a person [[unlawfully at large]] e.g. an offender on a recall to prison or in the circumstances where someone has managed to [[escape from lawful custody]].

See also - [[Breach_of_the_peace#England,_Wales_and_Northern_Ireland|Breach of the peace (main article)]]

Any person may arrest an individual/individuals to prevent an occurring, repeated, or an about to occur [[breach of the peace]]. The breach of the peace power of arrest is provided by the [[common law]] and therefore an 'any person' power of arrest and entry both within the same definition &lt;ref&gt;https://www.scie.org.uk/care-act-2014/safeguarding-adults/adult-suspected-at-risk-of-neglect-abuse/law/pcea1984.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

This offence definition and power of arrest are contained under the [[common law]] definition of "breach of the peace". Section 17(5) of [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984|PACE 1984]] abolished all powers of a Constable to enter under the common law with the specific exception (subsection 6) when dealing with or preventing a common law breach of the peace.

Breach of the peace powers are unusual in the fact they originate from the laws [[Alfred the Great]] consolidated into the [[common law]] approximately 1,000 years before the modern Constable was thought up. The first legislative reference to the common law breach of the peace was under the [[Justice of the Peace Act 1361]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Edw3/34/1&lt;/ref&gt;. As a result, when a Constable uses their breach of the peace powers, they are acting 'any person' and not fully as a sworn officer in this capacity.

Until 2006, there was an "any person" power of arrest under part of the [[Theft Act 1968]] in England and Wales that related to [[poaching]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/schedule/1|title=Paragraph 2(4) of Schedule 1 to the Theft Act 1968|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was used by private [[water bailiff]]s (as opposed to [[Environment Agency]] bailiffs). This ceased to have effect as a result of a general repeal of such arrest powers by the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/15/schedule/7/paragraph/38 Paragraph 38] of Schedule 7 to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005; commenced by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/3495/article/2/made#article-2-1-m article 2(m)] of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (Commencement No. 4 and Transitory Provision) Order 2005&lt;/ref&gt; An officer or agent of certain companies may seize and detain any person who has committed an offence against the provisions of the [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/legResults.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Companies+Clauses+Consolidation+Act+1845&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;activeTextDocId=1035033 Companies Clauses Consolidation Act 1845] whose name and residence shall be but unknown to such officer or agent, and take them before a [[justice of the peace]], who "shall proceed with all convenient dispatch to the hearing and determining of the complaint against such offender".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Companies+Clauses+Consolidation+Act+1845&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1035033&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1035211&amp;filesize=772 |title=Companies Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 (c.16) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Parliamentary procedure|Standing Orders]] of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], the [[Serjeant at Arms of the British House of Commons|Serjeant at Arms]] has the power to take into custody any member of the public who is in a Members-only area of the House, or who misconducts themselves, or who fails to leave when the House sits in private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmstords/539/539.pdf|title=Standing Order 161 of the House of Commons|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Court Security Officers in [[England and Wales]] have the additional power to restrain and remove persons from court buildings under s53 [[Courts Act 2003]] as well as powers of search and seizure of certain articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/39/section/53|title=Courts Act 2003|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Ireland====
Similar provisions apply to Northern Ireland as to England and Wales, implemented through the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (SI 1989/1341)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1989/uksi_19891341_en_1 |title=The Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=2012-04-25 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; as amended by the Police and Criminal Evidence (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order (SI 2007/288).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/uksi_20070288_en_1 |title=The Police and Criminal Evidence (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 2007 No. 288 (NI. 2) |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=2007-02-07 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
While no statutory provision for citizen's arrest exists in [[Scots law]], there is a [[common law]] position that anyone committing an offence can be arrested using minimum force if necessary with consideration to what is reasonable in the relevant circumstances. The offence must be a serious one and not merely for a breach of the peace. The person exercising the power must have witnessed the offence occurring therefore they cannot act upon information from another person. An arrest is applicable reliant on situation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200001/cmselect/cmarmed/154/1013004.htm House of Commons - Armed Forces - Minutes of Evidence&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1995/oct/18/citizens-arrest Citizen's Arrest (Hansard, 18 October 1995)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the [[United States]] a private person may [[arrest]] another without a [[arrest warrant|warrant]], for a crime occurring in their presence. For which crimes this is permitted may vary state by state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/magazine/how-to-make-a-citizens-arrest.html|title=How to Make a Citizen’s Arrest|last=Wollan|first=Malia|date=May 6, 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 26, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Common law====
Most states have codified the common law rule that a warrantless arrest may be made by a private person for a felony, misdemeanor or "breach of peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Daily, JD|first=James|title=Superheroes and Citizen's Arrest|url=http://lawandthemultiverse.com/2011/03/07/superheroes-and-citizens-arrest/|work=Law and the Multiverse}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Breach of peace" covers a multitude of violations in which the Supreme Court has even included a misdemeanor seatbelt violation punishable only by a
fine. The term historically included theft, "nightwalking", prostitution and playing card and dice games.&lt;ref name="Supreme Court of the United States"&gt;{{cite web|title=Atwater v. Lago Vista (No. 99-1408)|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/99-1408|publisher=Supreme Court of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State statutes====
California Penal Code section 837 is a good example of this codification:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
837. A private person may arrest another:
# For a public offense committed or attempted in his/her presence.
# When the person arrested has committed a felony, although not in his presence.
# When a felony has been in fact committed, and he or she has reasonable cause for believing the person arrested to have committed it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Public offense" is read similarly as breach of peace in this case and includes felonies, misdemeanors and infractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Penal Code Section 16|url=http://law.onecle.com/california/penal/16.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People v. Landis|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-superior-court/1050756.html|publisher=Appellate Division, Superior Court,Orange County.|quote="Public offenses" include infractions.  (Pen.Code § 16; People v. Tennessee (1970) 4 Cal.App.3d 788, 791, 84 Cal.Rptr. 697.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that there is generally no provision for an investigative detention by a private person under the law. With certain exceptions (see below) an arrest must be made. "Holding them until the police get there", is simply a form of arrest. The officer is accepting the arrest and processing the prisoner on behalf of the private person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizens' Arrest |url=http://le.alcoda.org/publications/point_of_view/files/Citizen.pdf |publisher=Alameda County District Attorney's Office }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of felonies, a private person may make an arrest for a felony occurring outside their presence but the rule is that a felony must have, in fact, been committed. For example, imagine a suspect has been seen on surveillance video vandalizing a building to the extent that the arrestor believes it rises to a felony due to the damage. If they find the suspect and make the arrest but it later turns out that it was misdemeanor damage, the arrestor is liable for [[false arrest]] because a felony had not, in fact, been committed.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Because most states have codified their arrest laws, there are many variations. For example, in Pennsylvania, the
courts have been clear that a citizen cannot make an arrest for a "summary offense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Legg |first=Jason |title=From the Desk of the DA |url=http://www.susquehannacounty-da.org/PDF/pdf2008/16may08.pdf |work=Susquehanna County Office of the District Attorney |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903083247/http://www.susquehannacounty-da.org/PDF/pdf2008/16may08.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In North Carolina, there is no de jure "citizens' arrest". Although it is essentially the same, North Carolina law refers to it as a "detention".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detention of offenders by private persons. |url=http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_15A/GS_15A-404.html |work=North Carolina General Statutes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115092943/http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_15A/GS_15A-404.html |archivedate=2012-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states seem to allow only arrests in cases of felonies but court decisions have ruled more broadly. For example in Virginia, the statute appears to only permit warrantless arrests by officers listed in the Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=§19.2-81 Arrest Without a Warrant|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/virginia/2006/toc1902000/19.2-81.html|work=Code of Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Virginia courts have upheld warrantless arrests by citizens for misdemeanors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Thomas WILSON v. COMMONWEALTH of Virginia|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/va-court-of-appeals/1175015.html|publisher=Court of Appeals of Virginia, Richmond.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use of force====
In general, a private person is justified in using non-deadly force upon another if they reasonably believe that: (1) such other person is committing a felony, or a misdemeanor amounting to a breach of the peace; and (2) the force used is necessary to prevent further commission of the offense and to apprehend the offender. The force must be reasonable under the circumstances to restrain the individual arrested. This includes the nature of the offense and the amount of force required to overcome resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use of Force for Law Enforcement Purposes|url=http://www.lexisnexis.cfom/lawschool/study/outlines/html/crim/crim11.htm|work=Criminal Law Capsule Summary|publisher=LexisNexis}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flynn|first=Michael W.|title=Citizen's Arrest |url=http://legallad.quickanddirtytips.com/citizens-arrest-2.aspx|work=Legal Lad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shopkeeper's (merchant's) privilege ====
In some states of the United States, the courts recognize a common law [[shopkeeper's privilege]], under which a shopkeeper is allowed to detain a suspected [[shoplifting|shoplifter]] on store property for a reasonable period of time, so long as the shopkeeper has cause to believe that the person detained in fact committed, or attempted to commit, theft of store property. The purpose of this detention is to recover the property and make an arrest if the merchant desires.&lt;ref&gt;W. Page, Keeton et al., ''Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts'' § 22, at 142 (5th ed. 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Differing liability from police ====
Private persons are occasionally granted immunity from civil or criminal liability, like the police are, when arresting others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByArticle/Chapter_15A/Article_20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; While the powers to arrest are similar, police are entitled to mistake of fact in most cases, while citizens can be held to a stricter liability depending on the individual state. Police can also detain anyone upon reasonable suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terry v. Ohio (392 U.S. 1 (1968)) |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/392/1/case.html |publisher=Supreme Court of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ordinary citizens cannot claim "qualified immunity" to attempt to defend against a civil complaint for false arrest.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/qualified_immunity&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Déformation professionnelle''''' ({{IPA-fr|defɔʁmasjɔ̃ pʁɔfɛsjɔnɛl|lang}}) is a tendency to look at things from the point of view of one's own [[profession]] or special [[expertise]], rather than from a broader or humane perspective. It is often translated as "professional deformation" or "job conditioning", though French ''[[wikt:déformation#French|déformation]]'' can also be translated as "distortion". The implication is that [[Professional development|professional training]], and its related [[socialization]], often result in a distortion of the way one views the world.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Bönisch, [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/karriere/deformation-professionnelle-beruflich-bedingte-missbildung-1.786888 "Déformation professionnelle: Beruflich bedingte Missbildung"] ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' (November 30, 2007). Retrieved March 5, 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel laureate [[Alexis Carrel]] observed, "Every specialist, owing to a well-known professional bias, believes that he understands the entire human being, while in reality he only grasps a tiny part of him."&lt;ref name="Carrel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrel|first1=Alexis|title=Man, The Unknown|date=1939|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|location=New York|url=http://hpaba.com/pages/en/ALEXIS%20CARREL%20Man%20the%20Unknown%201935.pdf|accessdate=28 June 2017|chapter=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a term in psychology, it was likely coined by the Belgian sociologist Daniel Warnotte&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert K. Merton]] ''Social Theory and Social Structure''. Glencoe, IL: Free Press, 1957, p. 198: "The transition to a study of the negative aspects of bureaucracy is afforded by the application of Veblen's concept of 'trained incapacity', Dewey’s notion of 'occupational psychosis' or Warnotte's view of 'professional deformation'."[http://www.sociosite.net/topics/texts/merton_bureaucratic_structure.php]&lt;/ref&gt; or Russian-American sociologist [[Pitirim Sorokin]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The '''empathizing–systemizing''' ('''E–S''') '''theory''' suggests that people may be classified on the basis of their scores along two dimensions: empathizing (E) and systemizing (S). It measures a person's strength of interest in [[empathy]] (the ability to identify and understand the thoughts and feelings of others and to respond to these with appropriate emotions) and a person's strength of interest in [[system]]s (in terms of the drive to analyse or construct them).

According to the originator of the hypothesis, [[Simon Baron-Cohen]], the E-S theory has been tested using the [[Empathy Quotient]] (EQ) and Systemizing Quotient (SQ), developed by him and colleagues, and generates five different 'brain types' depending on the presence or absence of discrepancies between their scores on E or S. E-S profiles show that the profile E&gt;S is more common in females than in males, and the profile S&gt;E is more common in males than in females.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Knickmeyer | first2 = Rebecca C. | last3 = Belmonte | first3 = Matthew K. | title = Sex differences in the brain: implications for explaining autism | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 310 | issue = 5749 | pages = 819&amp;ndash;823 | publisher = [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] | doi = 10.1126/science.1115455 | pmid = 16272115 | date = 4 November 2005 | url = https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1115455}} [http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2005_BC_etal_Science.pdf Pdf.]

==History==

E-S theory was developed by psychologist [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] as a major reconceptualization of cognitive sex differences in the general population and in an effort to understand why the cognitive difficulties in autism appeared to lie in domains in which he says on average females outperformed males and why cognitive strengths in autism appeared to lie in domains in which on average males outperformed females.&lt;ref name=BaroncohenExtreme&gt;{{cite journal | author=Baron-Cohen, S. | title=The extreme male brain theory of autism | journal=[[Trends in Cognitive Sciences]] |publisher=[[Cell Press]] | year=2002 | pages=248&amp;ndash;254 | volume=6 | issue=6 | doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(02)01904-6  | pmid = 12039606 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first chapter of his 2003 book ''The Essential Difference'', he compares with the bestseller ''[[Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus]]'', written by [[John Gray (U.S. author)|John Gray]] in 1992-3, and states: "the view that men are from Mars and women Venus paints the differences between the two sexes as too extreme. The two sexes are different. but are not ''so'' different that we cannot understand each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Baron-Cohen, S. | title=The Essential Difference.

He had previously proposed the [[mind-blindness]] theory in 1985, which argued that children with autism are delayed in their development of a [[theory of mind]], that is, the ability to understand the thoughts and feelings of themselves or others. Baron-Cohen says a strength of this theory lies in its power to explain one of the core features of autism (the social and communication difficulties), but a limitation of the mindblindness theory is that it ignored the other main domain in autism (unusually narrow interests and highly repetitive behaviors, also called 'resistance to change or need for sameness'). To address this, Baron-Cohen put forward the E-S theory.&lt;ref name="e-s theory" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baron-Cohen, S. |title=Autism, hypersystemizing, and truth |journal=[[The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology]] |publisher=[[Experimental Psychology Society]] |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=64–75 |year=2008 |pmid=18038339 |doi=10.1080/17470210701508749 |url=http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2008_BC_JEP_Autism_hypersystemizing_and_truth.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730185949/http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2008_BC_JEP_Autism_hypersystemizing_and_truth.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a distinction can be traced back to [[Robert Vischer]] in 1873,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vischer |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Vischer |date=1873 |title=On the Optical Sense of Form: A Contribution to Aesthetics}} In {{cite book |date=1994 |title=Empathy, Form, and Space.

According to Baron-Cohen, females on average score higher on measures of [[empathy]] and males on average score higher on measures of systemizing. This has been found using the child and adolescent versions of the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and the Systemizing Quotient (SQ), which are completed by parents about their child/adolescent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Auyeung | first1 = Bonnie | last2 = Wheelwright | first2 = Sally | last3 = Allison | first3 = Carrie | last4 = Atkinson | first4 = Matthew | last5 = Samarawickrema | first5 = Nelum | last6 = Baron-Cohen | first6 = Simon | title = The children's Empathy Quotient and Systemizing Quotient: sex differences in typical development and in autism spectrum conditions | journal = [[Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders]] | volume = 39 | issue = 11 | pages = 1509&amp;ndash;1521 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/s10803-009-0772-x | pmid = 19533317 | date = November 2009 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-009-0772-x}} [http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2009_Auyeung_etal_ChildEQSQ_JADD.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; and on the self-report version of the EQ and SQ in adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Wheelwright | first2 = Sally | title = The Empathy Quotient: an investigation of adults with Asperger Syndrome or High Functioning Autism, and normal sex differences | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 163&amp;ndash;175 | publisher = Springer | doi = 10.1023/B:JADD.0000022607.19833.00 | date = April 2004 | url = https://doi.org/10.1023/B:JADD.0000022607.19833.00}} [http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2004_BCandSW_EQ.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron-Cohen and associates say that similar sex differences on average have been found using performance tests of empathy such as facial emotion recognition tasks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Golan | first1 = Ofer | last2 = Baron-Cohen | first2 = Simon | last3 = Hill | first3 = Jacqueline | title = The Cambridge Mindreading (CAM) Face-Voice Battery: testing complex emotion recognition in adults with and without Asperger Syndrome | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 169&amp;ndash;183 | publisher = Springer | doi = 10.1007/s10803-005-0057-y | pmid = 16477515 | date = February 2006 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-005-0057-y}} [http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2006_Golan_etal_AdultCAMbattery.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; and on performance tests of systemizing such as measures of mechanical reasoning or 'intuitive physics'.&lt;ref name=LawsonSystemising&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lawson | first1 = John | last2 = Baron-Cohen | first2 = Simon | last3 = Wheelwright | first3 = Sally | title = Empathising and systemising in adults with and without Asperger Syndrome | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 301&amp;ndash;310 | publisher = Springer | doi = 10.1023/B:JADD.0000029552.42724.1b | pmid = 15264498 | date = June 2004 | url = https://doi.org/10.1023/B:JADD.0000029552.42724.1b}} [https://wiki.inf.ed.ac.uk/pub/ECHOES/RelevantPapers/2004_Lawson_etal_JADD.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; He also argues that these sex differences are not only due to socialization.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007/&gt;

==Fetal testosterone==

While experience and socialization contribute to the observed sex differences in empathy and systemizing, Baron-Cohen and colleagues suggest that biology also plays a role. A candidate biological factor influencing E and S is fetal testosterone (FT).&lt;ref name=Prevalent&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Lombardo | first2 = Michael V. | last3 = Auyeung | first3 = Bonnie | last4 = Ashwin | first4 = Emma | last5 = Chakrabarti | first5 = Bhismadev | last6 = Knickmeyer | first6 = Rebecca | title = Why are Autism Spectrum conditions more prevalent in males?

== Evolutionary explanations for sex differences ==

Baron-Cohen presents several possible [[evolutionary psychology]] explanations for this sex difference. For example, he says that better empathizing may improve care of children, and that better empathy may also improve women's social network which may help in various ways with the caring of children. On the other hand, he says that systemizing may help males become good hunters and increase their social status by improving spatial navigation and the making and use of tools.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007&gt;{{citation | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | contribution = Chapter 16 The evolution of empathizing and systemizing: assortative mating of two strong systemizers and the cause of autism | editor-last1 = Dunbar | editor-first1 = Robin I.

== Extreme male brain theory of autism==

Baron-Cohen's work in systemizing-empathizing led him to investigate whether higher levels of fetal [[testosterone]] explain the increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorders among males&lt;ref name=Geeky&gt;{{cite news | last = Baron-Cohen | first = Simon |url= http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=are-geeky-couples-more-likely-to-have-kids-with-autism |title= Are geeky couples more likely to have kids with autism? |work= [[Scientific American]] |date= 9 November 2012 |accessdate= 28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his theory is known as the "extreme male brain" theory of autism. A review of his book ''The Essential Difference''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Baron-Cohen | first = Simon | title = The essential difference | publisher = Penguin | location = London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780713996715}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2003 summarizes his proposals as: "the male brain is programmed to systemize and the female brain to empathize&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;Asperger's syndrome represents the extreme male brain".&lt;ref name= Benenson/&gt;

Baron-Cohen and colleagues extended the E-S theory into the extreme male brain theory of autism, which hypothesizes that autism shows an extreme of the typical male profile.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 2005"/&gt; This theory divides people into five groups:
*Type E, whose empathy is at a significantly higher level than their systemizing (E&gt;S).
*Type S, whose systemizing at a significantly higher level than their empathy (S&gt;E).
*Type B (for balanced), whose empathy is at the same level as their systemizing (E=S).
*Extreme Type E, whose empathy is above average but whose systemizing is below average (E&gt;&gt;S).
*Extreme Type S, whose systemizing is above average but whose empathy is below average (S&gt;&gt;E).

Baron-Cohen says that tests of the E-S model show that twice as many females than males are Type E and twice as many males than females are Type S. 65% of people with autism spectrum conditions are Extreme Type S.&lt;ref name="e-s theory" /&gt; The concept of the Extreme Type E brain has been proposed; however, little research has been conducted on this brain profile.&lt;ref name="Krieser, N. 2011"/&gt;

Apart from the research using EQ and SQ, several other similar tests also have found female and male differences and that people with autism or Asperger syndrome on average score similarly to but more extremely than the average male.&lt;ref name=Cohen2010/&gt; For example, the brain differences model provides a broad overview of sex differences that are represented in individuals with autism, including brain structures and hormone levels.&lt;ref name="Krieser, N. 2011"/&gt;

Some, but not all, studies have found that brain regions that differ in average size between males and females also differ similarly between people who have autism and those who do not have autism.&lt;ref name=Cohen2010&gt;Baron-Cohen, Simon (2010), "[https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-53630-3.00011-7 Empathizing, systemizing, and the extreme male brain theory of autism]", {{cite book | editor-last = Savic | editor-first = Ivanka | title = Sex differences in the human brain, their underpinnings and implications | pages = 167&amp;ndash;175 | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam | series = Progress in Brain Research (Volume 186)}} [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/432f/33d618c6cbd648e67e0e1b5fb5b16a67bea1.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron-Cohen's research on relatives of people with Asperger syndrome and autism found that their fathers and grandfathers are twice as likely to be engineers as the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Wheelwright | first2 = Sally | last3 = Stott | first3 = Carol | last4 = Bolton | first4 = Patrick | last5 = Goodyer | first5 = Ian | title = Is there a link between engineering and autism? | journal = [[Autism (journal)|Autism]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 101&amp;ndash;109 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1362361397011010 | date = July 1997 | url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1362361397011010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural science students have more relatives with autism than humanities students. Another similar finding by Baron-Cohen in California has been referred to as the ''Silicon Valley phenomenon'', where a large portion of the population works in technical fields, and he says autism prevalence rates are ten times higher than the average of the US population.&lt;ref name = BC2012&gt;{{cite news | last = Baron-Cohen | first = Simon | title = Autism and the technical mind: live chat with Simon Baron-Cohen, November 9, 10 A.M. EST |url= https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/baron-cohen-autism-and-technical-mind-live-chat/ | volume = 307 | issue = 5 | pages = 72&amp;ndash;75 |work= [[Scientific American]] |date= November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These data suggest that genetics and the environment play a role in autism prevalence, and children with technically minded parents are therefore more likely to be diagnosed with autism.&lt;ref name = BC2012 /&gt;

Baron-Cohen's studies have been questioned. The overrepresentation of engineers could depend on a sampling bias,&lt;ref name="Christopher Jarrold, David A. Routh 281–289"/&gt; and a 2010 analysis of autism diagnoses in California did ''not'' find that autism clustered preferentially around areas rich in IT industry. Instead, it found that clusters tended to occur in areas where parents were older and educated to a higher level than were parents in surrounding areas.&lt;ref name="easy to understand article"/&gt;

Another possibility has been proposed that spins the perspective of the extreme male brain.  Social theorists have been investigating the concept that females have protective factors against autism by having a more developed language repertoire and more empathy skills. Female children speak earlier and use language more than their male counterparts, and the lack of this skill translates into many symptoms of autism, offering another explanation for the discrepancy in prevalence.&lt;ref name="Krieser, N. 2011"/&gt;

===Development of brain structures===
The fetal testosterone theory hypothesizes that higher levels of [[testosterone]] in the [[amniotic fluid]] of mothers push brain development towards improved ability to see patterns and analyze complex systems while diminishing communication and empathy, emphasizing "male" traits over "female", or in [[E-S theory]] terminology, emphasizing "systemizing" over "empathizing". This theory states that fetal testosterone influences the development of certain structures in the brain, and that these changes relate to behavioral traits seen in those with autism. Males generally have higher levels of fetal testosterone contributing to their brain developing in that particular way.&lt;ref name="Luders, E. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Luders | first1 = Eileen | last2 = Toga | first2 = Arthur W. | last3 = Thompson | first3 = Paul M. | title = Why size matters: Differences in brain volume account for apparent sex differences in callosal anatomy: The sexual dimorphism of the corpus callosum | journal = [[NeuroImage]] | volume = 84 | pages = 820&amp;ndash;824 | publisher = Elsevier | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.09.040 | pmid = 24064068 | pmc = 3867125 | date = 1 January 2014 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.09.040}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bruner | first1 = Emiliano | last2 = de la Cuétara | first2 = José Manuel | last3 = Colom | first3 = Roberto | last4 = Martin-Loeches | first4 = Manuel | title = Gender-based differences in the shape of the human corpus callosum are associated with allometric variations | journal = [[Journal of Anatomy]] | volume = 220 | issue = 4 | pages = 417&amp;ndash;421 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7580.2012.01476.x | pmc = 3375777 | pmid = 22296183 | date = April 2012 | url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7580.2012.01476.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extreme male brain theory (EMB), put forward by Baron-Cohen&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 2005"/&gt; suggests that autistic brains show an exaggeration of the features associated with male brains. These are mainly size and connectivity with males generally having a larger brain with more white matter, leading to increased connectivity in each hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 2005"/&gt; This is seen in an exaggerated form in the brains of those with ASD. Another feature of male brains is having a smaller corpus callosum in at least some regions leading to decreased inter-hemispheric connectivity.&lt;ref name="Luders, E. 2014"/&gt; This is also seen in those with ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frazier | first1 = Thomas W. | last2 = Hardan | first2 = Antonio Y. | title = A meta-analysis of the corpus callosum in autism | journal = [[Biological Psychiatry (journal)|Biological Psychiatry]] | volume = 66 | issue = 10 | pages = 935&amp;ndash;941 | publisher = Elsevier | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.07.022 | pmid = 19748080 | pmc = 2783565 | date = 15 November 2009 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.07.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with ASD were found to have widespread interconnectivity abnormalities in specific brain regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = Jeffrey S. | last2 = et al | title = Decreased interhemispheric functional connectivity in autism | journal = [[Cerebral Cortex (journal)|Cerebral Cortex]] | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 1134&amp;ndash;1146 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhq190 | pmid = 20943668 | pmc = 3077433 | date = May 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhq190}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could explain the different results on empathy tests between men and women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Teatero | first1 = Missy L. | last2 = Netley | first2 = Charles | title = A critical review of the research on the extreme male brain theory and digit ratio (2D:4D) | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 43 | issue = 11 | pages = 2664&amp;ndash;2676 | publisher = Springer | doi = 10.1007/s10803-013-1819-6 | pmid = 23575643 | date = November 2013 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-013-1819-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the deficiencies in empathy seen in ASD as empathy requires several brain regions to be activated which need information from many different areas of the brain.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 2005"/&gt;  A further example of how brain structure can influence ASD is looking at cases where the corpus callosum does not fully develop (agenesis of corpus callosum).

High levels of fetal testosterone have also been shown to be related to behavior associated with autism, such as eye contact.

This suggests that fetal testosterone (fT) is the cause of sex differences in the brain and that there is a link between fT levels and ASD.

This is a possible cause for the male prevalence seen in autism.

==Imprinted brain theory==
{{Main|Imprinted brain theory}}
The imprinted brain theory is a somewhat similar although not identical theory. It argues that autism and [[psychosis]] are contrasting disorders on a number of variables. This is argued to be due to imbalanced [[genomic imprinting]]. According to the imprinted brain theory there could be a mismatch and more severe problems when extreme genomic imprinting occurs in the opposite sex, which would explain why female autism (and male psychosis) is often particularly severe, which is a problem for the "extreme male brain" theory which predicts the opposite.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Badcock | first1 = Christopher | last2 = Crespi | first2 = Bernard | title = Battle of the sexes may set the brain | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 454 | issue = 7208 | pages = 1054&amp;ndash;1055 | publisher = [[Nature Publishing Group|NPG]] | doi = 10.1038/4541054a | pmid =  18756240  | date = 28 August 2008 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/479025a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive versus affective empathy==
{{see also|Empathy#Affective and cognitive}}

Empathy can be subdivided into two major components: 
* [[cognitive empathy]] (also termed [[Mentalization|'mentalizing']]), the ability to understand another's mental state; 
* [[affective empathy|affective or emotional empathy]], the ability to emotionally respond to another's mental states. Affective empathy can be subdivided into [[personal distress]] (self-centered feelings of discomfort and anxiety in response to another's suffering) and [[empathic concern]] (sympathy towards others that are suffering).&lt;ref name = response&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Minio-Paluello | first1 = Ilaria | last2 = Lombardo | first2 = Michael V. | last3 = Chakrabarti | first3 = Bhismadev | last4 = Wheelwright | first4 = Sally | last5 = Baron-Cohen | first5 = Simon | title = Response to Smith's Letter to the Editor "''Emotional Empathy in Autism Spectrum Conditions: Weak, Intact, or Heightened?''" | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume=39 | issue=12 | pages = 1749–1754 | publisher = Springer | doi = 10.1007/s10803-009-0800-x | date = December 2009 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-009-0800-x}} [http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/bc249/papers/minio-paluello_2009_jadd.pdf Pdf.]

Studies found that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) self-report lower levels of empathic concern, show less or absent comforting responses toward someone who is suffering, and report equal or higher levels of personal distress compared to controls.&lt;ref name = response/&gt; The combination of reduced empathic concern and increased personal distress may lead to the overall reduction of empathy in ASD.&lt;ref name = response/&gt;

Studies also suggest that individuals with ASD may have impaired theory of mind, involving the ability to understand the perspectives of others.&lt;ref name = Rogers&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rogers | first1 = Kimberley | last2 = Dziobek | first2 = Isabel | last3 = Hassenstab | first3 = Jason | last4 = Wolf | first4 = Oliver T. | last5 = Convit | first5 = Antonio | title = Who cares?

Baron-Cohen argued that psychopathy is associated with intact cognitive empathy but reduced affective empathy while ASD is associated with both reduced cognitive and affective empathy.&lt;ref name="zero degrees"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baron-Cohen |first=Simon |title=Zero Degrees of Empathy: A New Theory of Human Cruelty |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5QUPgbxY4C4C |year=2011 |publisher=Penguin UK |location= London |isbn= 9780713997910 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The theory has been criticized on multiple grounds. Columnist at ''[[The Guardian]]'' [[Madeleine Bunting]] has summarized some of these aspects in the 2010 article "The truth about sex difference is that if men are from Mars, so are women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The truth about sex difference is that if men are from Mars, so are women | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/14/women-men-differences-science-stereotypes | author=Bunting, Madeleine | authorlink=Madeleine Bunting | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | location=[[Kings Place]], London | publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] | date=14 November 2010 | accessdate=January 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research in systemizing and empathizing in early life indicates that boys and girls develop in similar ways, casting considerable doubt on the theory of sex differences in these areas.&lt;ref name=Nash&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nash | first1 = Alison | last2 = Grossi | first2 = Giordana | author-link2 = Giordana Grossi | title = Picking Barbie™’s brain: inherent sex differences in scientific ability? | journal = Journal of Interdisciplinary Feminist Thought, special issue: Women and Science | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | page = 5 | publisher = Springer | date = 2007 | url = http://digitalcommons.salve.edu/jift/vol2/iss1/5}} [http://digitalcommons.salve.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=jift Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; A cognitive style that more naturally opposes empathizing is [[Machiavellianism]], which emphasizes self-interest and which has been shown to be strongly correlated with competitiveness; [[evolutionary theory]] predicts that males will be more competitive than females. In contrast, research has generally shown a weak negative correlation between empathizing and systemizing.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;

Another criticism is that original EQ and SQ, which form most of the research basis behind the notions of empathizing and systemizing, both clearly measure more than one factor, and that sex differences exist on only some of the factors.&lt;ref name=Andrew&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andrew | first1 = J. | last2 = Cooke | first2 = M. | last3 = Muncer | first3 = Steven J. | title = The relationship between empathy and Machiavellianism: an alternative to empathizing–systemizing theory | journal = [[Personality and Individual Differences]] | volume = 44 | issue = 5 | pages = 1203&amp;ndash;1211 | publisher = Elsevier | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2007.11.014 | date = April 2008 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2007.11.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a basis for his theory, Baron-Cohen cites a study done on newborn infants in which baby boys looked longer at an object and baby girls looked longer at a person.&lt;ref name="spelke"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Spelke | first = Elizabeth S. | title = Sex differences in intrinsic aptitude for mathematics and science?: A critical review | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 60 | issue = 9 | pages = 950&amp;ndash;958 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] via [[PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.60.9.950 | pmid = 16366817 | date = December 2005 | url = https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.60.9.950}} [https://software.rc.fas.harvard.edu/lds/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/spelke2005.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a review of studies done with very young children found no consistent differences between boys and girls.&lt;ref name="spelke"/&gt;
 
Critics say that because his work has focused on higher-functioning individuals with autism spectrum disorders, his work requires independent replication with broader samples.&lt;ref name=Buchen&gt;{{cite journal | last = Buchen | first = Lizzie | title = Scientists and autism: When geeks meet | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume= 479 | pages = 25&amp;ndash;27 | publisher = [[Nature Publishing Group|NPG]] | doi = 10.1038/479025a | pmid = 22051657 | date = 2 November 2011 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/479025a}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Nature'' article published in 2011 says, "Some critics are also rankled by Baron-Cohen's history of headline-grabbing theories—particularly one that autism is an 'extreme male' brain state. They worry that his theory about technically minded parents may be giving the public wrong ideas, including the impression that autism is linked to being a 'geek'."&lt;ref name=Buchen/&gt;

''Time'' magazine said Baron-Cohen "most dramatically wandered into fraught territory in 2003, when he published the book ''The Essential Difference'', which called autism a manifestation of an extreme 'male brain'--one that's 'predominantly hard-wired for understanding and building systems,' as opposed to a 'female brain,' one that's 'predominantly hard-wired for empathy'--and ended up on the wrong side of the debate on science and sex differences."&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news | last = Warner | first = Judith |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2089358,00.html |title= Autism's lone wolf |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= 29 August 2011 |accessdate= 28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book review published in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt; "The idea that males are more interested in systemizing than females merits serious consideration&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;It is unquestionably a novel and fascinating idea that seems likely to generate a rich empirical body of literature as its properties are tested.

Colleagues [[Isabelle Rapin]] and [[Helen Tager-Flusberg]] expressed reservations about the theory;&lt;ref name=McGough/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Isabelle Rapin&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;finds Dr. Baron-Cohen's theory "provocative" but adds that "it does not account for some of the many neurological features of the disorder, like the motor symptoms [such as repetitive movements and clumsiness], the sleep problems or the seizures." Others worry that the term "extreme male brain" could be misinterpreted. Males are commonly associated with "qualities such as aggression," says Helen Tager-Flusberg&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;"What's dangerous is that's the inference people will make: Oh, these are extreme males."&lt;ref name=McGough&gt;{{cite news | last = McGough | first = Robert |title= Is the autistic brain too masculine? | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10583036864206600 |work= Wall Street Journal |date= 16 July 2003 |page= B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences'' characterized ''The Essential Difference'' as "very disappointing" with a "superficial notion of intelligence", concluding that Baron-Cohen's major claims about mind-blindness and systemizing–empathizing are "at best, dubious".&lt;ref name= Levy&gt;{{cite journal | last = Levy | first = Neil | title = Book review: Understanding blindness | journal = Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 315&amp;ndash;324 | publisher = Springer | doi = 10.1023/B:PHEN.0000049328.20506.a1 | date = September 2004 | url = https://doi.org/10.1023/B:PHEN.0000049328.20506.a1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Spectator]]'' says that "The emphasis on the ultra-maleness approach is no doubt attributable to the fact that Baron-Cohen works mainly with higher functioning autism and Asperger's syndrome."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Lawson-Tancred | first = Hugh |url= http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/14th-june-2003/67/what-little-boys-and-girls-are-made-of |title= What little boys and girls are made of | work = [[The Spectator]] |date= 14 June 2003 |page= 67 |accessdate= 29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10482">In [[:Category theory]] and related fields of mathematics, an '''envelope''' is a construction that generalizes the operations of "exterior completion", like completion of a locally convex space, or [[Stone–Čech compactification]] of a topological space. A dual construction is called [[Refinement (category theory)|refinement]]. 

== Definition ==

Suppose &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a category, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; an object in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; two classes of morphisms in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. The definition{{sfn|Akbarov|2016|p=42}} of an envelope of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in the class &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the class &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; consists of two steps.
[[File:Extension-3.jpg|thumb|Extension.]]

* A morphism &lt;math&gt;\sigma:X\to X'&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''extension of the object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in the class of morphisms &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the class of morphisms &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;'', if &lt;math&gt;\sigma\in\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, and for any morphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi:X\to B&lt;/math&gt; from the class &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; there exists a unique morphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi':X'\to B&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi=\varphi'\circ\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.
[[File:Envelope-3.jpg|thumb|Envelope.]]
 
* An extension &lt;math&gt;\rho:X\to E&lt;/math&gt; of the object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in the class of morphisms &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the class of morphisms &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''envelope of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;'', if for any other extension &lt;math&gt;\sigma:X\to X'&lt;/math&gt; (of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;) there is a unique morphism &lt;math&gt;\upsilon:X'\to E&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\rho=\upsilon\circ\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. The object &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is also called an ''envelope of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;''.
 
Notations:

&lt;math&gt;
\rho=\text{env}_{\Phi}^{\Omega}X, \qquad 
E=\text{Env}_{\Phi}^{\Omega}X.
&lt;/math&gt;

In a special case when &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is a class of all morphisms whose ranges belong to a given class of objects &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; it is convenient to replace &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; in the notations (and in the terms):
 
&lt;math&gt;
\rho=\text{env}_{\Phi}^L X, \qquad 
E=\text{Env}_{\Phi}^L X.
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, if &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is a class of all morphisms whose ranges belong to a given class of objects &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; it is convenient to replace &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; in the notations (and in the terms):
 
&lt;math&gt;
\rho=\text{env}_M^{\Omega} X, \qquad 
E=\text{Env}_M^{\Omega} X.
&lt;/math&gt;

For example, one can speak about an ''envelope of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in the class of objects &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the class of objects &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;'':

&lt;math&gt;
\rho=\text{env}_M^L X, \qquad 
E=\text{Env}_M^L X.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Applications ==

Envelopes appear as standard functors in various fields of mathematics. Apart from the examples given above, 

* the [[Gelfand transform]] &lt;math&gt; G_A:A\to C(\text{Spec} A)&lt;/math&gt; of a commutative involutive [[stereotype algebra]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous envelope of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;{{sfn|Akbarov|2016}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2013}}; 

* for each [[locally compact abelian group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; the [[Fourier transform]] &lt;math&gt; F_A:C^\star(G)\to C(\widehat{G})&lt;/math&gt;  is a continuous envelope of the [[Stereotype algebra#Stereotype group algebras|stereotype group algebra]] &lt;math&gt;C^\star(G) &lt;/math&gt; of measures with compact support on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;{{sfn|Akbarov|2016}}. 

In [[abstract harmonic analysis]] the notion of envelope plays a key role in the generalizations of the [[Pontryagin  duality]] theory{{sfn|Akbarov|2017}} to the clases of non-commutative groups: the holomorphic, the smooth and the continuous envelopes of [[stereotype algebra]]s (in the  examples given above) lead respectively to the constructions of the holomorphic, the smooth and the continuous dualities in ''big geometric disciplines'' – [[complex geometry]], [[differential geometry]], and [[topology]] – for certain classes of (not necessarily commutative) topological groups considered in these disciplines ([[affine algebraic group]]s, and some classes of [[Lie group]]s and Moore groups).{{sfn|Akbarov|2009}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2016}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2017}}{{sfn|Kuznetsova|2013}}

== Introduction ==
In mathematics, '''equivariant topology''' is the study of [[topological space]]s that possess certain symmetries. In studying topological spaces, one often considers continuous maps &lt;math&gt;f:X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;, and while equivariant topology also considers such maps, there is the additional constraint that each map "respects symmetry" in both its domain and target space.

The notion of symmetry is usually captured by considering a [[Group action]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and demanding that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[Equivariant map|equivariant]] under this action, so that &lt;math&gt;f(g\cdot x)=g \cdot f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, a property  usually denoted by  &lt;math&gt;f:X \to_{G} Y&lt;/math&gt; . Heuristically speaking, standard topology views two spaces as equivalent "up to deformation," but equivariant topology considers spaces equivalent up to deformation so long as it  pays attention to any symmetry possessed by both spaces. A famous theorem of equivariant topology is the [[Borsuk–Ulam theorem]] , which asserts that every &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt;-equivariant map &lt;math&gt;f:S^n \to \mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; necessarily vanishes.

== Induced &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-bundles ==
An important construction used in [[Equivariant cohomology]] and other applications includes a naturally occurring group bundle ( see [[Principal bundle]] for details.)

Let us first consider the case where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acts freely on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then, given a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-equivariant map &lt;math&gt;f:X \to_G Y&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain sections &lt;math&gt;s_f: X/G \to (X \times Y)/G &lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;[x] \mapsto [x,f(x)]&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;X  \times Y&lt;/math&gt; gets the diagonal action, &lt;math&gt;g(x,y)=(gx,gy)&lt;/math&gt;  and the bundle is &lt;math&gt;p:(X \times Y)/G \to X/G&lt;/math&gt;, with fiber &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and projection given by &lt;math&gt;p([x,y])=[x]
&lt;/math&gt;.  Often, the total space is written &lt;math&gt;X \times_G Y&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, the assignment &lt;math&gt;s_f&lt;/math&gt; actually does not map to &lt;math&gt;(X \times Y)/G&lt;/math&gt; generally. Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is equivariant, if &lt;math&gt;g \in G_x&lt;/math&gt;(the isotropy subgroup), then by equivariance, we have that &lt;math&gt;g \cdot f(x)=f(g \cdot x)=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, so in fact &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; will map to the collection of &lt;math&gt;\{[x,y] \in (X \times Y)/G \mid G_x \subset G_y\}&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, one can replace the bundle by a [[Equivariant cohomology#Homotopy quotient|homotopy quotient]] where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acts freely and is bundle homotopic to the induced bundle on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

== Applications To Discrete Geometry ==
In the same way that one can deduce the [[Ham sandwich theorem]] from the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem, one can find many applications of equivariant topology to problems of discrete geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540003625|title=Using the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem - Lectures on Topological Methods in Combinatorics and Geometry {{!}} Jiri Matousek {{!}} Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Discrete-Computational-Mathematics-Applications/dp/1584883014|title=Handbook of Discrete and Computational Geometry, Second Edition|date=2004-04-15|publisher=Chapman and Hall/CRC|isbn=9781584883012|editor-last=Goodman|editor-first=Jacob E.|edition= 2nd|location=Boca Raton|language=English|editor-last2=O'Rourke|editor-first2=Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is accomplished by using the Configuration-Space Test-Map paradigm:

Given a geometric problem &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;,  we define the ''configuration space'', &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, which parametrizes all associated  solutions to the problem (such as points, lines, or arcs.) Additionally, we consider a ''test space'' &lt;math&gt;Z \subset V&lt;/math&gt; and a map &lt;math&gt;f:X \to V&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;p \in X&lt;/math&gt; is a solution to a problem if and only if &lt;math&gt;f(p) \in Z&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, it is usual to consider natural symmetries in a discrete problem by some group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that acts on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is equivariant under these actions. The problem  is solved if we can show the nonexistence of an equivariant map &lt;math&gt;f:X \to V\setminus Z&lt;/math&gt;.

Obstructions to the existence of such maps are often formulated algebraically from the topological data of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V\setminus Z&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/matschke/thesisMatschke.pdf|title=Equivariant topology methods In discrete geometry|last=Matschke|first=Benjamin|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An archetypal example of such an obstruction can be derived having &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; a vector space and &lt;math&gt;Z=\{0\}&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, a nonvanishing map would also induce a nonvanishing section &lt;math&gt;s_f:x \mapsto [x,f(x)]&lt;/math&gt; from the discussion above, so &lt;math&gt;\omega_n(X \times_G Y)&lt;/math&gt;, the top [[Stiefel–Whitney class]] would need to vanish.

== Examples ==
* The identity map &lt;math&gt;i:X \to X&lt;/math&gt; will always be equivariant. 
* If we let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt; act antipodally on the unit circle, then &lt;math&gt;z \mapsto z^3&lt;/math&gt;is equivariant, since it is an odd function.
* Any map &lt;math&gt;h:X \to X/G&lt;/math&gt; is equivariant when &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acts trivially on the quotient, since &lt;math&gt;f(g\cdot x)=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

'''''Everything Will Be OK''''' is the title of a hard-cover [[folio format]] book and full-length DVD published in 2005 in Italy. It is primarily a collection of videos, animations and print-specific artworks by artists working in and around the internet and is published by ''[[This is a magazine]]'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisamagazine.com This is a magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;(about nothing). It is the fourth book from a series of experimental publications by Donnachie, Simionato &amp; Son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donnachie-simionato.com Donnachie, Simionato &amp; Son (Publishers)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Adrian Shaughnessy, chief-editor of ''Varoom Magazine'' (UK) said “This is not a book, it is an event. Like [[Helmut Newton]]’s book-with-table, or the repackaging of [[Andy Warhol]]’s [[Interview Magazine|''Interview'']] magazine in a suitcase-with-wheels, ...it is more like a portable multi-media exhibition than a book...Donnachie/Simionato have created a publishing phenomenon.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.varoom-mag.com ''Varoom Magazine, Journal for Made Images'', Issue 1, August 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==DVD==
Included with each copy of the book is the DVD of the same title containing original time-based artworks and video. The book also contained a plastic devil's horn ([[corna]]) lucky charm bookmark, a sealed sugar-cube, and a pink latex balloon printed with the words "Everything will be OK".

The DVD contains a number of [[Easter egg (media)#Easter eggs on DVDs|easter eggs]] viewable by moving left twice then pressing play when selecting Augustin Gimel's film title from the index. It also has a hidden sub-titles track which when viewed becomes a second layer of black [[silhouettes]] for the video ''Holes in Between'' by Donnachie/Simionato with original music by the avant-garde band [[Starfuckers]]. An archive of This is a magazine online editions from 2002 to 2004, including the Everything will be OK [[Powerpoint]] episode is accessible from the DVD-ROM section.

==Netart==
An associated [[net art]] called EverythingwillbeOK.com&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everythingwillbeok.com Everything will be ok]&lt;/ref&gt; comprising a video-loop of an inflatable stick figure has been maintained since 2004.

==Collections==
The Everything will be OK project, including the original video DVD and hard-cover book is part of the KIOSK collection, Christoph Keller's&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curatingdegreezero.org/c_keller/c_keller.html Christoph Keller]&lt;/ref&gt; touring art publications archive, now a permanent collection of the National Art Library in Berlin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smb.museum/kb Kunstbibliothek, Stiftung Preussischer Kulturbesitz]&lt;/ref&gt; and has been exhibited at the ICA (USA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icaphila.org/exhibitions/beyondkiosk.php Beyond Kiosk, ICA, Philadelphia, United States (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; the Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art Rotterdam (Rotterdam),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdw.nl/project.php?id=48 Printing Matters, Witte de With, Rotterdam, Netherlands (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artists Space]] (NY), the [[Emily Carr Institute]] (Vancouver), and [[Mudam]] (Luxembourg), among others.

'''Gasification''' is a process that converts [[biomass|organic]]- or [[fossil fuel]]-based [[carbonaceous]] materials into [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. This is achieved by reacting the material at high temperatures (&gt;700&amp;nbsp;°C), without combustion, with a controlled amount of [[oxygen]] and/or [[steam]]. The resulting gas mixture is called [[syngas]] (from synthesis gas) or [[producer gas]] and is itself a fuel. The power derived from gasification and combustion of the resultant gas is considered to be a source of [[renewable energy]] if the gasified compounds were obtained from biomass.&lt;ref name="nnfcc"&gt;{{cite web| author =[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]|url= http://wiki.gekgasifier.com/f/Review+of+Biomass+Gasification+Technologies.NNFCC.Jun09.pdf |title =Review of Technologies for Gasification of Biomass and Wastes, NNFCC project 09/008|accessdate = 2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biomass.uk.com/gasification.php The Clean and Renewable Energy Source], biomass.uk.com, accessed 16.05.11 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910155717/http://www.biomass.uk.com/gasification.php |date=2011-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gastechnology.org/webroot/app/xn/xd.aspx?it=enweb&amp;xd=iea/homepage.xml Thermal Gasification of Biomass, International Energy Agency Task 33], http://www.gastechnology.org, accessed 16.05.11 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509002845/http://www.gastechnology.org/webroot/app/xn/xd.aspx?it=enweb&amp;xd=iea%2Fhomepage.xml |date=2011-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://waste-management-world.com/a/plasma-gasification-clean-renewable-fuel-through-vaporization-of-waste|title = Plasma gasification: Clean renewable fuel through vaporization of waste |website = www.waste-management-world.com|accessdate = May 16, 2011|date =January 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantage of gasification is that using the syngas (synthesis gas H2/CO) is potentially more efficient than direct combustion of the original fuel because it can be combusted at higher temperatures or even in [[fuel cell]]s, so that the thermodynamic upper limit to the efficiency defined by [[Carnot's rule]] is higher or (in case of fuel cells) not applicable. Syngas may be burned directly in [[internal combustion engines|gas engines]], used to produce [[methanol]] and hydrogen, or converted via the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]] into [[synthetic fuel]]. Gasification can also begin with material which would otherwise have been disposed of such as [[organic waste|biodegradable waste]]. In addition, the high-temperature process refines out corrosive ash elements such as [[chloride]] and [[potassium]], allowing clean gas production from otherwise problematic fuels. Gasification of fossil fuels is currently widely used on industrial scales to generate electricity.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Higman and Maarten van der Burgt.

==History==
[[File:Adler Diplomat 3 GS mit Holzgasgenerator-hinten rechts.JPG|thumb|right|[[Adler Diplomat]] 3 with gas generator (1941)]]

The process of producing energy using the gasification method has been in use for more than 180 years. In the early time [[coal]] and [[peat]] were used to power these plants. Initially developed to produce [[town gas]] for lighting and cooking in the 1800s, this was replaced by electricity and [[natural gas]], it was also used in [[blast furnaces]] but the bigger role was played in the production of [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] chemicals where it has been in use since the 1920s.

During both [[world wars]], especially the [[World War II]], the need for fuel produced by gasification reemerged due to the shortage of petroleum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://membres.lycos.fr/rotarysu/nouvelle.htm Gas Generator Project] History of the Gasogene technology&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wood gas generator]]s, called Gasogene or Gazogène, were used to power motor vehicles in [[Europe]]. By 1945 there were trucks, buses and agricultural machines that were powered by gasification. It is estimated that there were close to 9,000,000 vehicles running on producer gas all over the world.

==Chemical reactions==
In a gasifier, the carbonaceous material undergoes several different processes:
[[File:pyrolysis.svg|frame|Pyrolysis of carbonaceous fuels]]
[[File:gasification.gif|frame|Gasification of char]]
# The [[dehydration reaction|dehydration]] or drying process occurs at around 100&amp;nbsp;°C.  Typically the resulting steam is mixed into the gas flow and may be involved with subsequent chemical reactions, notably the water-gas reaction if the temperature is sufficiently high (see step #5).
# The ''[[pyrolysis]]'' (or devolatilization) process occurs at around 200–300&amp;nbsp;°C.  Volatiles are released and [[charring|char]] is produced, resulting in up to 70% weight loss for coal. The process is dependent on the properties of the carbonaceous material and determines the structure and composition of the char, which will then undergo gasification reactions.
# The ''[[combustion]]'' process occurs as the volatile products and some of the char react with oxygen to primarily form carbon dioxide and small amounts of carbon monoxide, which provides heat for the subsequent gasification reactions. Letting '''C''' represent a carbon-containing [[organic compound]], the basic reaction here is &lt;math&gt;{\rm C} + {\rm O}_2 \rarr {\rm CO}_2&lt;/math&gt;
# The ''gasification'' process occurs as the char reacts with steam to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen, via the reaction &lt;math&gt;{\rm C} + {\rm H}_2 {\rm O} \rarr {\rm H}_2 + {\rm CO}&lt;/math&gt;
# In addition, the [[reversible reaction|reversible]] gas phase [[water-gas shift reaction]] reaches [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] very fast at the temperatures in a gasifier. This balances the concentrations of carbon monoxide, steam, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. &lt;math&gt;{\rm CO} + {\rm H}_2 {\rm O} \lrarr {\rm CO}_2 + {\rm H}_2&lt;/math&gt;

In essence, a limited amount of oxygen or air is introduced into the reactor to allow some of the organic material to be "burned" to produce carbon dioxide and energy, which drives a second reaction that converts further organic material to hydrogen and additional carbon dioxide. Further reactions occur when the formed carbon monoxide and residual [[water]] from the organic material react to form methane and excess carbon dioxide (&lt;math&gt;4 {\rm CO} + 2 {\rm H}_2{\rm O} \rarr {\rm CH}_4 + 3 {\rm CO}_2&lt;/math&gt;). This third reaction occurs more abundantly in reactors that increase the [[Residence time distribution|residence time]] of the reactive gases and organic materials, as well as heat and pressure. [[Catalysts]] are used in more sophisticated reactors to improve reaction rates, thus moving the system closer to the reaction equilibrium  for a fixed residence time.

==Processes==
[[File:Gasifier types.svg|500px|thumb|Main gasifier types]]
Several types of gasifiers are currently available for commercial use: counter-current fixed bed, co-current fixed bed, [[fluidized bed]], entrained flow, plasma, and free radical.&lt;ref name="nnfcc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beychok, M.R., ''Process and environmental technology for producing SNG and liquid fuels'', U.S. EPA report EPA-660/2-75-011, May 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beychok, M.R., ''Coal gasification for clean energy'', Energy Pipelines and Systems, March 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beychok, M.R., ''Coal gasification and the Phenosolvan process'', American Chemical Society 168th National Meeting, Atlantic City, September 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counter-current fixed bed ("up draft") gasifier===
A fixed bed of carbonaceous fuel (e.g. coal or biomass) through which the "gasification agent" (steam, oxygen and/or air) flows in counter-current configuration.&lt;ref&gt;Thanapal SS, Annamalai K, Sweeten J, Gordillo G, (2011), “Fixed bed gasification of dairy biomass with enriched air mixture”. Appl Energy, doi:10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.11.072&lt;/ref&gt; The ash is either removed in the dry condition or as a [[slag]]. The slagging gasifiers have a lower ratio of steam to carbon,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|title=Development Status of BGL-Gasification|url=http://www.iec.tu-freiberg.de/conference/conference_05/pdf/21_Picard.pdf|format=PDF|last1=Kamka|first1=Frank|last2=Jochmann|first2=Andreas|date=June 2005|conference=International Freiberg Conference on IGCC &amp; XtL Technologies|others=speaker Lutz Picard|accessdate=2011-03-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719095948/http://www.iec.tu-freiberg.de/conference/conference_05/pdf/21_Picard.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; achieving temperatures higher than the ash fusion temperature. The nature of the gasifier means that the fuel must have high mechanical strength and must ideally be non-caking so that it will form a permeable bed, although recent developments have reduced these restrictions to some extent.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} The throughput for this type of gasifier is relatively low. Thermal efficiency is high as the temperatures in the gas exit are relatively low. However, this means that tar and methane production is significant at typical operation temperatures, so product gas must be extensively cleaned before use. The tar can be recycled to the reactor.

In the gasification of fine, undensified biomass such as [[rice husks|rice hulls]], it is necessary to blow air into the reactor by means of a fan. This creates very high gasification temperature, as high as 1000 C. Above the gasification zone, a bed of fine and hot char is formed, and as the gas is blow forced through this bed, most complex hydrocarbons are broken down into simple components of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Co-current fixed bed ("down draft") gasifier===
Similar to the counter-current type, but the gasification agent gas flows in co-current configuration with the fuel (downwards, hence the name "down draft gasifier"). Heat needs to be added to the upper part of the bed, either by combusting small amounts of the fuel or from external heat sources. The produced gas leaves the gasifier at a high temperature, and most of this heat is often transferred to the gasification agent added in the top of the bed, resulting in an energy efficiency on level with the counter-current type. Since all tars must pass through a hot bed of char in this configuration, tar levels are much lower than the counter-current type.

===Fluidized bed reactor===

The fuel is [[fluidization|fluidized]] in oxygen and steam or air. The ash is removed dry or as heavy agglomerates that defluidize. The temperatures are relatively low in dry ash gasifiers, so the fuel must be highly reactive; low-grade coals are particularly suitable. The agglomerating gasifiers have slightly higher temperatures, and are suitable for higher rank coals. Fuel throughput is higher than for the fixed bed, but not as high as for the entrained flow gasifier. The conversion efficiency can be rather low due to [[elutriation]] of carbonaceous material.  Recycle or subsequent combustion of solids can be used to increase conversion. Fluidized bed gasifiers are most useful for fuels that form highly corrosive ash that would damage the walls of slagging gasifiers. Biomass fuels generally contain high levels of corrosive ash.

===Entrained flow gasifier===
A dry pulverized solid, an atomized liquid fuel or a fuel slurry is gasified with oxygen (much less frequent: air) in co-current flow. The gasification reactions take place in a dense cloud of very fine particles. Most coals are suitable for this type of gasifier because of the high [[operating temperature]]s and because the coal particles are well separated from one another.

The high temperatures and pressures also mean that a higher throughput can be achieved, however thermal efficiency is somewhat lower as the gas must be cooled before it can be cleaned with existing technology. The high temperatures also mean that tar and methane are not present in the product gas; however the oxygen requirement is higher than for the other types of gasifiers. All entrained flow gasifiers remove the major part of the ash as a slag as the operating temperature is well above the ash fusion temperature.

A smaller fraction of the ash is produced either as a very fine dry [[fly ash]] or as a black colored fly ash slurry. Some fuels, in particular certain types of biomasses, can form slag that is corrosive for ceramic inner walls that serve to protect the gasifier outer wall. However some entrained flow type of gasifiers do not possess a ceramic inner wall but have an inner water or steam cooled wall covered with partially solidified slag. These types of gasifiers do not suffer from corrosive slags.

Some fuels have ashes with very high ash fusion temperatures. In this case mostly limestone is mixed with the fuel prior to gasification. Addition of a little limestone will usually suffice for the lowering the fusion temperatures. The fuel particles must be much smaller than for other types of gasifiers. This means the fuel must be pulverized, which requires somewhat more energy than for the other types of gasifiers. By far the most energy consumption related to entrained flow gasification is not the milling of the fuel but the production of oxygen used for the gasification.

===Plasma gasifier===
In a [[Plasma gasification|plasma gasifier]] a high-voltage current is fed to a torch, creating a high-temperature arc. The inorganic residue is retrieved as a glass like substance.

==Feedstock==
There are a large number of different feedstock types for use in a gasifier, each with different characteristics, including size, shape, bulk density, moisture content, energy content, chemical composition, ash fusion characteristics, and homogeneity of all these properties. Coal and petroleum coke are used as primary feedstocks for many large gasification plants worldwide. Additionally, a variety of biomass and waste-derived feedstocks can be gasified, with wood pellets and chips, waste wood, plastics and aluminium, [[Municipal Solid Waste]] (MSW), [[Refuse-derived fuel]] (RDF), agricultural and industrial wastes, sewage sludge, switch grass, discarded seed corn, corn stover and other crop residues all being used.&lt;ref name="nnfcc"/&gt;

[[Chemrec]] has developed a process for gasification of [[black liquor]].&lt;ref name="chemrec"/&gt;

===Waste disposal===
[[File:HTCW reactor.jpg|right|thumbnail|150px|HTCW reactor, one of several proposed waste gasification processes.]]

Waste gasification has several advantages over incineration:
* The necessary extensive flue gas cleaning may be performed on the syngas instead of the much larger volume of [[flue gas]] after combustion.
* [[Electric power]] may be generated in [[internal combustion engine|engines]] and [[gas turbine]]s, which are much cheaper and more efficient than the [[Rankine cycle|steam cycle]] used in incineration. Even fuel cells may potentially be used, but these have rather severe requirements regarding the purity of the gas.
* Chemical processing ([[Gas to liquids]]) of the syngas may produce other synthetic fuels instead of electricity.
* Some gasification processes treat ash containing heavy metals at very high temperatures so that it is released in a glassy and chemically stable form.

A major challenge for waste gasification technologies is to reach an acceptable (positive) gross electric efficiency. The high efficiency of converting syngas to electric power is counteracted by significant power consumption in the waste preprocessing, the consumption of large amounts of pure oxygen (which is often used as gasification agent), and gas cleaning. Another challenge becoming apparent when implementing the processes in real life is to obtain long service intervals in the plants, so that it is not necessary to close down the plant every few months for cleaning the reactor.

Environmental advocates have called gasification "incineration in disguise" and argue that the technology is still dangerous to air quality and public health.  "Since 2003 numerous proposals for waste treatment facilities hoping to use... gasification technologies failed to receive final approval to operate when the claims of project proponents did not withstand public and governmental scrutiny of key claims," according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.no-burn.org/downloads/Incinerators%20in%20Disguise:%20Case%20Studies%20of%20Gasification,%20Pyrolysis,%20and%20Plasma%20in%20Europe,%20Asia,%20and%20the%20United%20States%20.pdf |title=GAIA Report |access-date=2013-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503091440/http://www.no-burn.org/downloads/Incinerators%20in%20Disguise:%20Case%20Studies%20of%20Gasification,%20Pyrolysis,%20and%20Plasma%20in%20Europe,%20Asia,%20and%20the%20United%20States%20.pdf |archive-date=2012-05-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One facility which operated from 2009–2011 in Ottawa had 29 "emissions incidents" and 13 "spills" over those three years.

Several waste gasification processes have been proposed, but few have yet been built and tested, and only a handful have been implemented as plants processing real waste, and most of the time in combination with fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/wtd/679004/679021/679065/ Gasification case studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060804215602/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/wtd/679004/679021/679065/ |date=2006-08-04 }} by the [[Environment Agency]] of England and Wales&lt;/ref&gt;

One plant (in [[Chiba, Chiba|Chiba]], Japan using the Thermoselect process&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thermoselect.com Thermoselect website] — A waste gasification plant supplier&lt;/ref&gt;) has been processing industrial waste with natural gas and purified oxygen since year 2000, but has not yet documented positive net energy production from the process.

In 2007 [[Ze-gen]] erected a waste gasification demonstration facility in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]. The facility was designed to demonstrate gasification of specific non-MSW waste streams using ''liquid metal gasification''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The winning bid was sealed.

==Current applications==
Syngas can be used for heat production and for generation of mechanical and electrical power. Like other gaseous fuels, producer gas gives greater control over power levels when compared to solid fuels, leading to more efficient and cleaner operation.

Syngas can also be used for further processing to liquid fuels or chemicals.

===Heat===
Gasifiers offer a flexible option for thermal applications, as they can be retrofitted into existing gas fueled devices such as [[oven]]s, [[furnace]]s, [[boiler]]s, etc., where syngas may replace fossil fuels. [[Heating value]]s of syngas are generally around 4–10 MJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Electricity===
Currently Industrial-scale gasification is primarily used to produce electricity from fossil fuels such as coal, where the syngas is burned in a gas turbine. Gasification is also used industrially in the production of electricity, ammonia and liquid fuels (oil) using Integrated Gasification Combined Cycles ([[Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle|IGCC]]), with the possibility of producing methane and hydrogen for fuel cells. IGCC is also a more efficient method of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture as compared to conventional technologies. IGCC demonstration plants have been operating since the early 1970s and some of the plants constructed in the 1990s are now entering commercial service.

===Combined heat and power===
In small business and building applications, where the wood source is sustainable, 250–1000 kWe and new zero carbon biomass gasification plants have been installed in Europe that produce tar free syngas from wood and burn it in reciprocating engines connected to a generator with heat recovery. This type of plant is often referred to as a wood biomass CHP unit but is a plant with seven different processes: biomass processing, fuel delivery, gasification, gas cleaning, waste disposal, electricity generation and heat recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=6 Wood Gasification CHP / Cogeneration Plants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707110458/http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=6 |date=2011-07-07 }}, 02.09.09&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport fuel===
[[Diesel engine]]s can be operated on dual fuel mode using producer gas. Diesel substitution of over 80% at high loads and 70–80% under normal load variations can easily be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kedco.com/ind/industrial/principles-of-gasification/ Gasification Appliances Review]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 04.02.08&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spark ignition engine]]s and [[solid oxide fuel cell]]s can operate on 100% gasification gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch/view/eth:41553 Electricity from wood through the combination of gasification and solid oxide fuel cells], Ph.D. Thesis by Florian Nagel, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://orbit.dtu.dk/getResource?recordId=209388&amp;objectId=1&amp;versionId=1 Characterization of biomass producer gas as fuel for stationary gas engines in combined heat and power production], Ph.D. Thesis by Jesper Ahrenfeldt, Technical University of Denmark March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biocellus.com/pdf/High_temperature_electrolyte.pdf High temperature electrolyte supported Ni-GDC/YSZ/LSM SOFC operation on two-stage Viking gasifier product gas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217093848/http://www.biocellus.com/pdf/High_temperature_electrolyte.pdf |date=2008-12-17 }}, Ph.

While small scale gasifiers have existed for well over 100 years, there have been few sources to obtain a ready to use machine. Small scale devices are typically [[DIY]] projects. However, currently in the United States, several companies offer gasifiers to operate small engines.

===Renewable energy and fuels===
[[File:Holzvergaser Güssing.jpg|thumb|230px|Gasification plant Güssing, Austria (2001-2015)]]
In principle, gasification can proceed from just about any organic material, including [[biomass]] and [[plastic pollution|plastic waste]]. The resulting syngas can be combusted. Alternatively, if the syngas is clean enough, it may be used for power production in gas engines, gas turbines or even fuel cells, or converted efficiently to [[dimethyl ether]] (DME) by methanol dehydration, methane via the [[Sabatier reaction]], or diesel-like synthetic fuel via the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]]. In many gasification processes most of the inorganic components of the input material, such as metals and minerals, are retained in the ash. In some gasification processes (slagging gasification) this ash has the form of a glassy solid with low [[Leaching (chemical science)|leaching]] properties, but the net power production in slagging gasification is low (sometimes negative) and costs are higher.

Regardless of the final fuel form, gasification itself and subsequent processing neither directly emits nor traps [[greenhouse gases]] such as carbon dioxide. Power consumption in the gasification and syngas conversion processes may be significant though, and may indirectly cause CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions; in slagging and plasma gasification, the electricity consumption may even exceed any power production from the syngas.

Combustion of syngas or derived fuels emits exactly the same amount of carbon dioxide as would have been emitted from direct combustion of the initial fuel. Biomass gasification and combustion could play a significant role in a renewable energy economy, because biomass production removes the same amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere as is emitted from gasification and combustion. While other biofuel technologies such as biogas and [[biodiesel]] are [[carbon neutral]], gasification in principle may run on a wider variety of input materials and can be used to produce a wider variety of output fuels.

There are at present a few industrial scale biomass gasification plants. Since 2008 in Svenljunga, Sweden, a biomass gasification plant generates up to 14 MW&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;, supplying industries and citizens of Svenljunga with process steam and [[district heating]], respectively. The gasifier uses [[biomass fuels]] such as [[Chromated copper arsenate|CCA]] or [[creosote]] impregnated waste wood and other kinds of recycled wood to produces syngas that is combusted on site.&lt;ref name="Elmia"&gt;[http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/pressroom/elmia/pressrelease/view/foergasning-ger-laegre-utslaepp-mindre-stoft-och-bredare-braenslebas-nyhet-paa-elmia-recycling-to-energy-2010-381629 Gasification allows less emissions, less dust and fuel flexibility] – News at Elmia Recycling to Energy 2010, 03.03.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iqr.se/en/products/combustion/sfc.aspx SFC – Soot Free Combustion: large scale biomass gasification], 03.03.11&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 a similar gasifier, using the same kinds of fuels, is being installed at [http://munkforsenergi.se/ Munkfors Energy]'s [[Cogeneration|CHP]] plant.

[[File:Purple_circle_100%25.svg|thumb| A purple circle is a symbol for gender neutrality, derived from the two [[gender symbols]]' colours mixed together, and without the distinguishing cross or arrow used in the gender symbols (♂ and ♀).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}]]

A '''gender-blind''' (or '''unisex''') person is someone who adheres to not distinguishing people by gender. Gender blind people generally advocate [[gender neutrality]] in society, such as activities undertaken and services provided without regard to the [[gender]] of those who participate. Those who identify as [[pansexual]] may also refer to themselves as 'gender-blind': however, pansexuality emphasizes gender-blindness in [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].

== Choice of words ==
{{Main|Gender neutral language}}

''Unisex'' is an older term, and a [[misnomer]] meaning "one sex". It should not be confused with [[bisexuality]].
''Gender-blind'' however goes against most tenets of [[heteronormativity]] by not looking at gender at all.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== The National Student Genderblind Campaign ==

In 2006 the National Student Genderblind Campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genderblind.org|title=Khóa Học Kế Toán Thực Hành Uy Tín Tại TPHCM – Một trang web mới sử dụng WordPress|website=www.genderblind.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created as a collaborative [[grassroots]] organization intended to educate [[college]] students, administrators, and others throughout the United States. The NSGC advocates for the implementation of gender-inclusive [[dormitory|dorm]] room and [[washroom|bathroom]] options.

==Mixed-gender hospital rooms==

The use of mixed-gender hospital rooms has proved controversial in both the United Kingdom and Canada.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;John Miner, Shared room sparks rage,London Free Press, June 17, 2010, http://www.lfpress.com/news/london/2010/06/16/14417821.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Manitoba's Health Minister, [[Theresa Oswald]], has campaigned actively against such rooms after receiving complaints from a Winnipeg patient, Ollie Ingram.&lt;ref name = Owen&gt;Bruce Owen, Oswald vows action to stop coed rooms in hospitals, Winnipeg Free Press, May 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Oswald said if humanity can "put somebody on the moon", it can find a way to honor gender requests without leading to delays for patients.&lt;ref name = Owen/&gt;  At the same time, some medical ethicists have been critical of efforts to return to single-sex rooms.&lt;ref name = Owen/&gt;   [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]], an advocate for mixed rooms in the United States, has written that opposition to gender-mixed rooms stems from "old-fashioned prejudice" and argues that: "Because some people have been brought up to fear or dislike sharing a room with a person of the opposite sex, or blush at the prospect of catching a glimpse of an unwelcome body part when a robe slips open, we enshrine and perpetuate this prejudice in social policy."&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Appel, Are We Ready for Coed Hospital Rooms? ''Huffington Post'', June 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Great Britain has agreed to phase out such rooms by 2010.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Criticism==

Much as with [[Color blindness (race)|similar approaches to dealing with racism and ethnicity]], not recognising and taking account of participants' sex can be harmful. It posits that it functions in a post-sexism society where women are no longer treated differently than men on the basis of their sex. Meanwhile, gendered treatment prevails all over the world. Of a study of organisations which offered women-only services, 23% said that their reason was based on women's inequality and the desire to address that imbalance; 20% that women-only spaces promote female development and empowerment; 18% that they were providing a service not being met by unisex services and which focused on the specific needs of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Women-only services: making the case. A guide for women’s organisations|date=July 2011|publisher=Women's Resource Centre|page=18|url=https://thewomensresourcecentre.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Making-the-case-for-women-only-July-2011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal test of the "reasonable person" has been criticised for being genderblind to be applied in some areas of the law, particularly sexual harassment. Women are subjected to more normalised and endemic sexual harassment than men. On the grounds of this, the American case of ''Ellison v. Brady'' 924 F.2d 872 (1991), the court held that "a sex-blind reasonable person standard tends to be male-based and tends to systematically ignore the experiences of women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=McCammon,|editor1-first=Holly J.|editor2-last=Taylor|editor2-first=Verta|editor3-last=Reger|editor3-first=Jo|editor4-last=Einwohner|editor4-first=Rachel L.|title=The Oxford Handbook of U.S. Women's Social Movement Activism|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Studies indicate a broad support for single-sex service options to remain available. Of 1000 women polled by the Women's Resource Centre, 97% stated that women should have the option of accessing female-only services if they were victims of sexual assault. 57% indicated that they would choose a women-only gym over a mixed gym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Women-only services: making the case.

'''Gerda Alexander''' (February 15, 1908 – February 21, 1994) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] teacher who devised a method of self-development called '''''Eutony'''''. She was born in [[Wuppertal]], [[Germany]], but moved to Denmark in 1929.

Alexander's parents were believers in [[eurythmy]], passing on to her a similar interest in movement.  Alexander as a young woman contracted [[rheumatic fever]] and [[endocarditis]], suffering several crises. This inspired her to find ways to move that did not exacerbate her symptoms. Long periods of rest stimulated her to look within herself looking for a "more economic" and more spontaneous form of movement, starting with learning regulation of muscle tone.&lt;ref name= "Knaster"&gt;{{cite book |last= Knaster |first= Mirka |year= 1996 |title= Discovering the Body's Wisdom: A Comprehensive Guide to More Than Fifty Mind-Body Practices |publisher= [[Bantam Books|Bantam]] |pages= 222–6 |isbn= 9780307575500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By means of observation and reflection on her students, their own ailments and difficulties in mobility, and the investigation of the neuro-psychological bases of human movement, she molded her own method. She postulated that "it is important, in treatment, not to give and do more than is necessary, so that the other can rely on himself.  It is not that I am the great master who gives you help.  Rather, I can introduce you to my work for your own self discovery."&lt;ref name=YogaJour1986&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reza Leah Bat Pinchas.|journal=Yoga Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA21|date=January–February 1986|title="The Energy is in the Bones": Eutony's Gerda Alexander |issue=66|pages=21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quackwatch]] describes Alexander's invention, Eutony, as "form of body-centered psychotherapy" which "posits 'blocked energy' and a collective unconscious".&lt;ref name=qw&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18649">The [[type theory]] was initially created to avoid paradoxes in a variety of formal [[mathematical logic|logic]]s and [[rewrite system]]s.  Later, type theory referred to a class of [[formal systems]], some of which can serve as alternatives to [[naive set theory]] as a foundation for all mathematics.

It has been tied to formal mathematics since ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' to today's [[proof assistant]]s.

== 1900–1927 ==

=== Origin of Russell's theory of types ===

In a letter to [[Gottlob Frege]] (1902) Russell announced his discovery of the paradox in Frege's [[Begriffsschrift]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell's (1902) ''Letter to Frege'' appears, with commentary, in van Heijenoort 1967:124–125.&lt;/ref&gt; Frege promptly responded, acknowledging the problem and proposing a solution in a technical discussion of "levels". To quote Frege:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Incidentally, it seems to me that the expression "a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] is predicated of itself" is not exact. A predicate is as a rule a first-level function, and this function requires an object as argument and cannot have itself as argument (subject). Therefore I would prefer to say "a concept is predicated of its own extension".&lt;ref&gt;Frege (1902) ''Letter to Russell'' appears, with commentary, in van Heijenoort 1967:126–128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He goes about showing how this might work but seems to pull back from it. &lt;!--(In a footnote, van Heijenoort notes that Frege, in his ''Grundgesetze der Arithmetik'' (1893), had used the symbol ∩ "for reducing second-level functions to first-level functions"&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:128&lt;/ref&gt;).--&gt; As a consequence of what has become known as [[Russell's paradox]] both Frege and Russell had to quickly amend works that they had at the printers. In an Appendix B that Russell tacked onto his ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' (1903) one finds his "tentative" theory of types. The matter plagued Russell for about five years.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Quine's commentary before Russell (1908) ''Mathematical Logic as based on the theory of types'' in van Heijenoort 1967:150&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Willard Quine]]&lt;ref&gt;cf. commentary by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]] before Russell's (1908) ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types'' in van Hiejenoort 1967:150–153&lt;/ref&gt; presents a historical synopsis of the origin of the theory of types and the "ramified" theory of types: after considering abandoning the theory of types (1905), Russell proposed in turn three theories:
{{ordered list|list_style_type=lower-roman
| the zigzag theory
| theory of limitation of size,
| the no-class theory (1905–1906) and then,
| readopting the theory of types (1908ff)
}}

Quine observes that Russell's introduction of the notion of "apparent variable" had the following result:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the distinction between 'all' and 'any': 'all' is expressed by the bound ('apparent') variable of universal quantification, which ranges over a type, and 'any' is expressed by the free ('real') variable which refers schematically to any unspecified thing irrespective of type.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quine dismisses this notion of "bound variable" as "''pointless apart from a certain aspect of the theory of types''".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Quine's commentary before Russell (1908) ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types'' in van Heijenoort 1967:151&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 1908 "ramified" theory of types ===

Quine explains the ''ramified'' theory as follows: "It has been so called because the type of a function depends both on the types of its arguments and on the types of the apparent variables contained in it (or in its expression), in case these exceed the types of the arguments".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Stephen Kleene]] in his 1952 ''Introduction to Metamathematics'' describes the ''ramified'' theory of types this way:

:The primary objects or individuals (i.e. the given things not being subjected to logical analysis) are assigned to one type (say ''type 0''), the properties of individuals to ''type 1'', properties of properties of individuals to ''type 2'', etc.; and no properties are admitted which do not fall into one of these logical types (e.g. this puts the properties 'predicable' and 'impredicable' ... outside the pale of logic). A more detailed account would describe the admitted types for other objects as relations and classes. Then to exclude [[impredicativity|impredicative]] definitions within a type, the types above type 0 are further separated into orders. Thus for type 1, properties defined without mentioning any totality belong to ''order 0'', and properties defined using the totality of properties of a given order belong to the next higher order. ... But this separation into orders makes it impossible to construct the familiar analysis, which we saw above contains impredicative definitions. To escape this outcome, Russell postulated his ''[[axiom of reducibility]]'', which asserts that to any property belonging to an order above the lowest, there is a coextensive property (i.e. one possessed by exactly the same objects) of order 0. If only definable properties are considered to exist, then the axiom means that to every impredicative definition within a given type there is an equivalent predicative one (Kleene 1952:44–45).

=== The axiom of reducibility and the notion of "matrix" ===

But because the stipulations of the ramified theory would prove (to quote Quine) "onerous", Russell in his 1908 ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types''&lt;ref&gt;Russell (1908) ''Mathematical Logic as based on the theory of types'' in van Heijenoort 1967:153–182&lt;/ref&gt; also would propose his ''[[axiom of reducibility]]''. By 1910 Whitehead and Russell in their ''Principia Mathematica'' would further augment this axiom with the notion of a '' matrix '' — a fully extensional specification of a function. From its matrix a function could be derived by the process of "generalization" and vice versa, i.e. the two processes are reversible — (i) generalization from a matrix to a function (by using apparent variables) and (ii) the reverse process of reduction of type by courses-of-values substitution of arguments for the apparent variable. By this method impredicativity could be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;cf. in particular p. 51 in Chapter II ''The theory of Logical Types'' and *12 ''The Hierarchy of Types and the Axiom of Reducibility'' pp. 162–167. Whitehead and Russell (1910–1913, 1927 2nd edition) ''Principia Mathematica''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Truth tables ===

Eventually [[Emil Post]] (1921) would lay waste to Russell's "cumbersome"&lt;ref&gt;Post (1921) ''Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions'' in van Heijenoort 1967:264–283, in particular p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of Types with his "truth functions" and their truth tables. In his "Introduction" to his 1921 Post places the blame on Russell's notion of apparent variable: "Whereas the complete theory [of Whitehead and Russell (1910, 1912, 1913)] requires for the enunciation of its propositions real and apparent variables, which represent both individuals and [[propositional function]]s of different kinds, and as a result necessitates the cumbersome theory of types, this subtheory uses only real variables, and these real variables represent but one kind of entity, which the authors have chosen to call elementary propositions".

At about the same time [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] made short work of the theory of types in his 1922 work [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]] in which he points out the following in parts 3.331–3.333:

{{quote|3.331 From this observation we get a further view – into Russell's Theory of Types. Russell's error is shown by the fact that in drawing up his symbolic rules he has to speak of the meanings of his signs.

3.332 No proposition can say anything about itself, because the propositional sign cannot be contained in itself (that is the whole "theory of types").

3.333 A function cannot be its own argument, because the functional sign already contains the prototype of its own argument and it cannot contain itself...}}

Wittgenstein proposed the truth-table method as well. In his 4.3 through 5.101, Wittgenstein adopts an unbounded [[Sheffer stroke]] as his fundamental logical entity and then lists all 16 functions of two variables (5.101).

The notion of matrix-as-truth-table appears as late as the 1940–1950s in the work of Tarski, e.g. his 1946 indexes "Matrix, see: Truth table"&lt;ref&gt;Tarski 1946, ''Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of Deductive Sciences'', Dover republication 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russell's doubts ===

Russell in his 1920 ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'' devotes an entire chapter to "The axiom of Infinity and logical types" wherein he states his concerns: "Now the theory of types emphatically does not belong to the finished and certain part of our subject: much of this theory is still inchoate, confused, and obscure. But the need of ''some'' doctrine of types is less doubtful than the precise form the doctrine should take; and in connection with the axiom of infinity it is particularly easy to see the necessity of some such doctrine".&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1920:135&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Russell abandons the axiom of reducibility''': In the second edition of ''Principia Mathematica'' (1927) he acknowledges Wittgenstein's argument.&lt;ref&gt;cf. "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:xiv and Appendix C&lt;/ref&gt; At the outset of his Introduction he declares "there can be no doubt ... that there is no need of the distinction between real and apparent variables...".&lt;ref&gt;cf. "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:i&lt;/ref&gt; Now he fully embraces the matrix notion and declares "A ''function can only appear in a matrix through its values''" (but demurs in a footnote: "It takes the place (not quite adequately) of the axiom of reducibility"&lt;ref&gt;cf. "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:xxix&lt;/ref&gt;). Furthermore, he introduces a new (abbreviated, generalized) notion of "matrix", that of a "logical matrix . . . one that contains no constants. Thus ''p''|''q'' is a logical matrix".&lt;ref&gt;The vertical bar " | " is the Sheffer stroke; cf. "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Russell has virtually abandoned the axiom of reducibility,&lt;ref&gt;"The theory of classes is at once simplified in one direction and complicated in another by the assumption that functions only occur through their values and by the abandonment of the axiom of reducibility"; cf. "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:xxxix&lt;/ref&gt; but in his last paragraphs he states that from "our present primitive propositions" he cannot derive "Dedekindian relations and well-ordered relations" and observes that if there is a new axiom to replace the axiom of reducibility "it remains to be discovered".&lt;ref&gt;These quotes from "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:xliv–xlv.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theory of simple types ===
In the 1920s, [[Leon Chwistek]]&lt;ref&gt;L. Chwistek, Antynomje logikiformalnej, ''Przeglad Filozoficzny'' 24 (1921) 164–171&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frank P. Ramsey]]&lt;ref&gt;F. P. Ramsey, The foundations of mathematics, ''Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society'', Series 2 25 (1926) 338–384.&lt;/ref&gt; noticed that, if one is willing to give up the [[vicious circle principle]],
the hierarchy of levels of types in the "ramified theory of types" can be collapsed.

The resulting restricted logic is called the theory of simple types&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1944, pages 126 and 136–138, footnote 17: "Russell's mathematical logic" appearing in ''Kurt Gödel: Collected Works: Volume II Publications 1938–1974'', Oxford University Press, New York NY, {{ISBN|978-0-19-514721-6}}(v.2.pbk).&lt;/ref&gt; or, perhaps more commonly, simple type theory.&lt;ref&gt;This does not mean the theory is "simple", it means that the theory is ''restricted'': types of different orders are not to be mixed: "Mixed types (such as classes containing individuals and classes as elements) and therefore also transfinite types (such as the class of all classes of finite types) are excluded." Gödel 1944, pages 127, footnote 17: "Russell's mathematical logic" appearing in ''Kurt Gödel: Collected Works: Volume II Publications 1938–1974'', Oxford University Press, New York NY, {{ISBN|978-0-19-514721-6}}(v.2.pbk).&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed formulations of simple type theory were published in the late 1920s and early 1930s
by R. Carnap, F. Ramsey, W.V.O. Quine, and A. Tarski. In 1940 [[Alonzo Church]] (re)formulated it as [[simply typed lambda calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Church, A formulation of the simple theory of types, Journal of Symbolic Logic 5 (1940) 56–68.&lt;/ref&gt; and examined by Gödel in 1944. A survey of these developments is found in Collins (2012).&lt;ref&gt;J. Collins, A History of the Theory of Types: Developments after the Second Edition of 'Principia Mathematica'. LAP Lambert Academic Publishing (2012). {{ISBN|978-3-8473-2963-3}}, esp. chs. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1940s–present ===
&lt;!--&gt;Quine reports that Ramsey 1931 urged the "dropping of the ramification and the axiom of reducibility"; Quine opines that "Russell's failure [was] due to this failure to distinguish between propositional functions as notations and propositional functions as attributes and relations.[Quine's commentary before Russell 1908 in van Heijenoort 1967:151–152]."&lt;/!--&gt;

==== Gödel 1944 ====
[[Kurt Gödel]] in his 1944 ''Russell's mathematical logic'' gave the following definition of the "theory of simple types" in a footnote:
:By the theory of simple types I mean the doctrine which says that the objects of thought (or, in another interpretation, the symbolic expressions) are divided into types, namely: individuals, properties of individuals, relations between individuals, properties of such relations, etc. (with a similar hierarchy for extensions), and that sentences of the form: " ''a'' has the property ''φ'' ", " ''b'' bears the relation ''R'' to ''c'' ", etc. are meaningless, if ''a, b, c, R, φ'' are not of types fitting together. Mixed types (such as classes containing individuals and classes as elements) and therefore also transfinite types (such as the class of all classes of finite types) are excluded. That the theory of simple types suffices for avoiding also the epistemological paradoxes is shown by a closer analysis of these. (Cf. ''Ramsey 1926'' and ''Tarski 1935'', p. 399).".&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1944:126 footnote 17: "Russell's mathematical logic" appearing in ''Kurt Gödel: Collected Works: Volume II Publications 1938–1974'', Oxford University Press, New York NY, {{ISBN|978-0-19-514721-6}}(v.2.pbk).&lt;/ref&gt;

He concluded the (1) theory of simple types and (2) axiomatic set theory, "permit the derivation of modern mathematics and at the same time avoid all known paradoxes" (Gödel 1944:126); furthermore, the theory of simple types "is the system of the first ''Principia'' [''Principia Mathematica''] in an appropriate interpretation. . . . [M]any symptoms show only too clearly, however, that the primitive concepts need further elucidation" (Gödel 1944:126).

==== Curry–Howard correspondence, 1934–1969 ====
The [[Curry–Howard correspondence]] is the interpretation of proofs-as-programs and formulae-as-types.  The idea starting in 1934 with [[Haskell Curry]] and finalized in 1969 with [[William Alvin Howard]].  It connected the "computational component" of many type theories to the derivations in logics.

Howard showed that the typed lambda calculus corresponded to intuitionistic [[natural deduction]].  (That is, natural deduction without the [[Law of excluded middle]].)  The connection between types and logic lead to a lot of subsequent research to find new type theories for existing logics and new logics for existing type theories.

==== de Bruijn's AUTOMATH, 1967–2003 ====
[[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn]] created the type theory [[Automath]] as a mathematical foundation for the Automath system, which could verify the correctness of proofs.  The system developed and added features over time as type theory developed.

==== Martin-Löf's Intuitionistic type theory, 1971–1984 ====
[[Per Martin-Löf]] found a type theory that corresponded to [[predicate logic]] by introducing [[dependent types]], which became known as [[intuitionistic type theory]] or Martin-Löf type theory.

Martin-Löf's theory uses inductive types to represent unbounded data structures, such as natural numbers.

==== Barendregt's lambda cube, 1991 ====
The [[lambda cube]] was not a new type theory but a categorization of existing type theories.  The eight corners of the cube included some existing theories with [[simply typed lambda calculus]] at the lowest corner and the [[calculus of constructions]] at the highest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14350">'''Humanity''' is a [[virtue]] associated with basic [[ethics]]   of [[altruism]] derived from the [[human condition]].

Humanity differs from mere [[justice]] in that there is a level of altruism towards individuals included in humanity more so than the fairness found in justice.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, humanity, and the acts of love, altruism, and social intelligence are typically individual strengths while fairness is generally expanded to all. 
Peterson &amp; Seligman in ''[[Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification]]'' (2004) class humanity as  one of six virtues that are consistent across all cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept goes back to the development of "humane" or "[[Renaissance humanism|humanist]]" philosophy during the [[Renaissance]] (with predecessors in 13th-century [[scholasticism]] stressing a concept of basic [[human dignity]] inspired by [[Aristotelianism]]) and the concept of [[humanitarianism]] in the [[early modern period]], and resulted in modern notions such as "[[human rights]]".

== Historical perspectives ==

=== Confucian philosophy ===
[[Confucius]] said that humanity, or “[[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]]”(仁), is a “love of people” stating “if you want to make a stand, help others make a stand.”&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the Confucian theory of humanity exemplifies the golden rule. It is so central to Confucian thought that it appears 58 times in the [[Analects]].&lt;ref&gt;Chan 1955, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the Christian process of seeking God, Confucius teachers seeking Ren to a point of seemingly divine mastery until you are equal to, or better than, your teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 1955, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; The Confucian concept of Ren encompasses both love and altruism.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 1955, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greek philosophy ===
[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] both wrote extensively on the subject of virtues, though neither ever wrote on humanity as a virtue, despite highly valuing love and kindness, two of the strengths of humanity. Plato and Aristotle considered "courage, justice, temperance" and "generosity, wit, friendliness, truthfulness, magnificence, and greatness of soul" to be the sole virtues, respectively.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Abrahamic religion ===
Humanity is one of [[Thomas Aquinas]]' "Seven Heavenly Virtues."&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond that, humanity was so important in some positivist Christian cultures that it was to be capitalized like God.&lt;ref&gt;Coit 1906, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Kindness, altruism and love are all mentioned in the bible. Proverbs 19:22 "states the desire of a man is his kindness." On the topic of altruism, emphasis is placed on helping strangers (Hebrews 13:1) and the biblical adage "it is better to give than to receive" (Acts 20:35).

== Strengths of humanity ==

=== Love ===
Love has many different definitions ranging from a set of purely biological and chemical processes to a religious concept. As a character strength, love is a mutual feeling between two people characterized by attachment, comfort, and generally positive feelings. It can be broken down into 3 categories:  love between a child and their parents, love for your friends, and romantic love.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Having love as a strength is not about the capacity to love, as such, it is about being involved in a loving relationship.

Love, in the psychological sense, is most often studied in terms of attachment to others. A degree of controversy surrounds defining and researching love in this way, as it takes away the “mystery of love.”&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; Because love is mysterious, to an extent, it is most often studied in terms of attachment theory, because it can be studied in the way across ages. In infants, attachment is studied through the Strange Situation Test. Attachment to an individual, usually the mother, is determined by how distressed the infant becomes when the mother is taken out of the experimental setting.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several models of adult attachment including the Adult Attachment Interviews (Kaplan &amp; Main), Adult Attachment Prototypes (Hazan &amp; Shaver) and more. Generally adult attachment models focus on the [[mental representation]] of the visible signs of attachment seen in infants.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence in support of the benefits of love are seen in the negative affect states that result from lacking love. Orphaned children have been targeted in studies about negative attributes resulting from lack of attachment. Smyke ''et al.'' found that children raised in an environment that didn’t allow children to become attached to their preferred caregivers experienced [[Attachment_disorder|attachment disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;Smkye 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, individuals who develop securely attached have a lower likelihood of depression, high-self esteem, and less likelihood of divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kindness ===
The strength kindness encompasses most related terms that evoke feelings of altruism, generosity, helpfulness and a general desire to help people. That is, a disposition for helping humanity. The following statements are from the [[Values in Action Inventory of Strengths | Values in Action]] (VIA) psychological assessment, aimed at determining people's strengths in kindness: others are just as important to me, giving is more important than receiving, I care for the ungrateful as well as the grateful.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; Kindness, as a part of humanity, is deeply rooted in philosophical and religious traditions, each having words for the altruistic love aspect of kindness, such as ''agape'' in Greek, ''chesed'' in Hebrew, and the Latin word ''philantropia'', the root of the word "philanthropy."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Kindness is so valued as a strength beyond religious and theoretical concepts that it is advocated through school community service programs and national programs like AmeriCorps. Additionally, while gender differences in kindness are statistically significant, they are minimal, and the methods of testing used may not always have construct validity.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kindness is most often measured on a case by case measure and not usually as a trait. The Self-Report Altruism Scale and the Altruism Facet Scale for Agreeableness Measure of the [[Revised NEO Personality Inventory]] (NEO-PI-R) psychological assessment are often used to ask people how often they engage in altruistic behaviors and gauge their concern for others.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; The former, however, only asks about 20 specific altruistic acts, leaving out a wide range of altruistic behaviors.

There are numerous benefits from kindness and altruism on both sides of the action. For some, the motivation to be kind comes from a place of egoistic motivation, and thus the benefit to them is the positive affect state they receive from the action.&lt;ref&gt;Dovido et. al 1990, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that the process of being kind develops pro-social skills in children, which positively effects their attachments and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Zeece 2009, p. 448.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, volunteerism in the elderly has shown to lead to decreased risk of early death, and mental health benefits.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; One thing to note is the difference between altruism as a trait and as an act.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

=== Social Intelligence ===
Social intelligence is the most modern of the three strengths associated with humanity. The Character Strengths and Virtues (CSV) psychological assessment  defines social intelligence as the ability to understand “relationships with other people, including the social relationships involved in intimacy and trust, persuasion, group membership, and political power.”&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelligence has many psychological definitions from Weschler’s intelligence to the various theories of multiple intelligence. The CSV divides intelligence into hot and cold, hot intelligence being those intelligences related to active emotional processes. (338) Individuals with high social intelligence are very self-aware, and effective organizers and leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it combines elements of the other two hot intelligences, personal and emotional intelligence. Personal intelligence being the internal counterpart to social intelligence and emotional intelligence being the capacity to understand emotions. The CSV highlights three social intelligence measurement scales: Factor Based Social Intelligence Tasks, Psychological Mindedness Assessment Procedure, and Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional intelligence Test.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social Intelligence research is limited, however, there is much literature on the characteristics associated with social intelligence. Zaccaro ''et al.'' found social intelligence and perceptiveness to be integral to effective leadership; that is, good leaders are “social experts.”&lt;ref&gt;Zaccaro et. al 1991, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional intelligence, too, plays a role in leadership. Another study found that emotional intelligence enables leaders to better understand their followers, thereby enhancing their ability to influence them.&lt;ref&gt;George 2000, p. 1043.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historic development ==

In 1972, [[Daniel Shanks|D. Shanks]] first discovered the infrastructure of a [[Quadratic field|real quadratic number field]] and applied his [[baby-step giant-step]] algorithm to compute the [[Dirichlet's unit theorem#The regulator|regulator]] of such a field in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(D^{1/4+\varepsilon})&lt;/math&gt; binary operations (for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Quadratic field#Discriminant|discriminant]] of the quadratic field; previous methods required &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(D^{1/2+\varepsilon})&lt;/math&gt; binary operations.&lt;ref name="shanks-infrastructure"&gt;D.

== One-dimensional case ==

=== Abstract definition ===

A '''one-dimensional (abstract) infrastructure''' &lt;math&gt;(X, d)&lt;/math&gt; consists of a [[real number]] &lt;math&gt;R &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, a [[finite set]] &lt;math&gt;X \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; together with an [[Injective function|injective]] map &lt;math&gt;d : X \to \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="fontein-pohlighellman"&gt;F. Fontein: Groups from cyclic infrastructures and Pohlig-Hellman in certain infrastructures. (English summary) Adv. Math. Commun. 2 (2008), no. 3, 293&amp;ndash;307. {{MR|2429459}}&lt;/ref&gt; The map &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is often called the ''distance map''.

By interpreting &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; as a [[circle]] of [[circumference]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and by identifying &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;d(X)&lt;/math&gt;, one can see a one-dimensional infrastructure as a circle with a finite set of points on it.

=== Baby steps ===

A '''baby step''' is a [[unary operation]] &lt;math&gt;bs : X \to X&lt;/math&gt; on a one-dimensional infrastructure &lt;math&gt;(X, d)&lt;/math&gt;. Visualizing the infrastructure as a circle, a baby step assigns each point of &lt;math&gt;d(X)&lt;/math&gt; the next one. Formally, one can define this by assigning to &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; the real number &lt;math&gt;f_x := \inf\{ f' &gt; 0 \mid d(x) + f' \in d(X) \}&lt;/math&gt;; then, one can define &lt;math&gt;bs(x) := d^{-1}(d(x) + f_x)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Giant steps and reduction maps ===

Observing that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is naturally an [[abelian group]], one can consider the sum &lt;math&gt;d(x) + d(y) \in \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt;. In general, this is not an element of &lt;math&gt;d(X)&lt;/math&gt;. But instead, one can take an element of &lt;math&gt;d(X)&lt;/math&gt; which lies ''nearby''. To formalize this concept, assume that there is a map &lt;math&gt;red : \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z} \to X&lt;/math&gt;; then, one can define &lt;math&gt;gs(x, y) := red(d(x) + d(y))&lt;/math&gt; to obtain a [[binary operation]] &lt;math&gt;gs : X \times X \to X&lt;/math&gt;, called the '''giant step''' operation. Note that this operation is in general ''not'' [[Associativity|associative]].

The main difficulty is how to choose the map &lt;math&gt;red&lt;/math&gt;. Assuming that one wants to have the condition &lt;math&gt;red \circ d = \mathrm{id}_X&lt;/math&gt;, a range of possibilities remain.   One possible choice&lt;ref name="fontein-pohlighellman" /&gt; is given as follows: for &lt;math&gt;v \in \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;f_v := \inf\{ f \ge 0 \mid v - f \in d(X) \}&lt;/math&gt;; then one can define &lt;math&gt;red(v) := d^{-1}(v - f_v)&lt;/math&gt;. This choice, seeming somewhat arbitrary, appears in a natural way when one tries to obtain infrastructures from global fields.&lt;ref name="fontein-infrastructure" /&gt; Other choices are possible as well, for example choosing an element &lt;math&gt;x \in d(X)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|d(x) - v|&lt;/math&gt; is minimal (here, &lt;math&gt;|d(x) - v|&lt;/math&gt; is stands for &lt;math&gt;\inf\{ |f - v| \mid f \in d(x) \}&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;d(x)&lt;/math&gt; is of the form &lt;math&gt;v + R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;); one possible construction in the case of real quadratic hyperelliptic function fields is given by S. D. Galbraith, M. Harrison and D. J. Mireles Morales.&lt;ref name="galbraith-harrison-mirelesmorales"&gt;S. D. Galbraith, M. Harrison, D. J. Mireles Morales: Efficient hyperelliptic arithmetic using balanced representation for divisors. (English summary) Algorithmic number theory, 342&amp;ndash;356, Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci., 5011, Springer, Berlin, 2008. {{MR|2467851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relation to real quadratic fields ===

D. Shanks observed the infrastructure in real quadratic number fields when he was looking at cycles of reduced [[binary quadratic form]]s. Note that there is a close relation between reducing binary quadratic forms and [[continued fraction]] expansion; one step in the continued fraction expansion of a certain [[quadratic irrational]]ity gives a [[unary operation]] on the set of reduced forms, which cycles through all reduced forms in one equivalence class. Arranging all these reduced forms in a cycle, Shanks noticed that one can quickly jump to reduced forms further away from the beginning of the circle by [[Composition of binary quadratic forms|composing]] two such forms and reducing the result. He called this [[binary operation]] on the set of reduced forms a '''giant step''', and the operation to go to the next reduced form in the cycle a '''baby step'''.

=== Relation to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; ===

The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; has a natural group operation and the giant step operation is defined in terms of it. Hence, it makes sense to compare the arithmetic in the infrastructure to the arithmetic in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. It turns out that the group operation of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; can be described using giant steps and baby steps, by representing elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; by elements of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; together with a relatively small real number; this has been first described by D. Hühnlein and S. Paulus&lt;ref name="huehnlein-paulus"&gt;D. Hühnlein, S. Paulus: On the implementation of cryptosystems based on real quadratic number fields (extended abstract). Selected areas in cryptography (Waterloo, ON, 2000), 288&amp;ndash;302, Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci., 2012, Springer, 2001. {{MR|1895598}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by M. J. Jacobson, Jr., R. Scheidler and H. C. Williams&lt;ref name="jacobson-scheidler-williams"&gt;M. J. Jacobson Jr., R. Scheidler, H. C. Williams: The efficiency and security of a real quadratic field based key exchange protocol. Public-key cryptography and computational number theory (Warsaw, 2000), 89&amp;ndash;112, de Gruyter, Berlin, 2001 {{MR|1881630}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of infrastructures obtained from real quadratic number fields. They used floating point numbers to represent the real numbers, and called these representations CRIAD-representations resp. &lt;math&gt;(f, p)&lt;/math&gt;-representations. More generally, one can define a similar concept for all one-dimensional infrastructures; these are sometimes called &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-representations.&lt;ref name="fontein-pohlighellman" /&gt;

A '''set of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-representations''' is a subset &lt;math&gt;fRep&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X \times \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; such that the map &lt;math&gt;\Psi_{fRep} : fRep \to \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}, \; (x, f) \mapsto d(x) + f&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection and that &lt;math&gt;(x, 0) \in fRep&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;red : \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z} \to X&lt;/math&gt; is a reduction map, &lt;math&gt;fRep_{red} := \{ (x, f) \in X \times \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z} \mid red(d(x) + f) = x \}&lt;/math&gt; is a set of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-representations; conversely, if &lt;math&gt;fRep&lt;/math&gt; is a set of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-representations, one can obtain a reduction map by setting &lt;math&gt;red(f) = \pi_1(\Psi_{fRep}^{-1}(f))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\pi_1 : X \times \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z} \to X, \; (x, f) \mapsto x&lt;/math&gt; is the projection on $X$. Hence, sets of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-representations and reduction maps are in a [[one-to-one correspondence]].

Using the bijection &lt;math&gt;\Psi_{fRep} : fRep \to \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, one can pull over the group operation on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;fRep&lt;/math&gt;, hence turning &lt;math&gt;fRep&lt;/math&gt; into an abelian group &lt;math&gt;(fRep, +)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x + y := \Psi_{fRep}^{-1}(\Psi_{fRep}(x) + \Psi_{fRep}(y))&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x, y \in fRep&lt;/math&gt;. In certain cases, this group operation can be explicitly described without using &lt;math&gt;\Psi_{fRep}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

In case one uses the reduction map &lt;math&gt;red : \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z} \to X, \; v \mapsto d^{-1}(v - \inf\{ f \ge 0 \mid v - f \in d(X) \})&lt;/math&gt;, one obtains &lt;math&gt;fRep_{red} = \{ (x, f) \mid f \ge 0, \; \forall f' \in [0, f) : d(x) + f' \not\in d(X) \}&lt;/math&gt;. Given &lt;math&gt;(x, f), (x', f') \in fRep_{red}&lt;/math&gt;, one can consider &lt;math&gt;(x'', f'')&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x'' = gs(x, x')&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f'' = f + f' + (d(x) + d(x') - d(gs(x, x'))) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;; this is in general no element of &lt;math&gt;fRep_{red}&lt;/math&gt;, but one can reduce it as follows: one computes &lt;math&gt;bs^{-1}(x'')&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f'' - (d(x'') - d(bs^{-1}(x'')))&lt;/math&gt;; in case the latter is not negative, one replaces &lt;math&gt;(x'', f'')&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;(bs^{-1}(x''), f'' - (d(x'') - d(bs^{-1}(x''))))&lt;/math&gt; and continues. If the value was negative, one has that &lt;math&gt;(x'', f'') \in fRep_{red}&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;\Psi_{fRep_{red}}(x, f) + \Psi_{fRep_{red}}(x', f') = \Psi_{fRep_{red}}(x'', f'')&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;(x, f) + (x', f') = (x'', f'')&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3108">In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]], an '''invariant''' is a property of a system which remains unchanged under some [[Transformation (mathematics)|transformation]].

==Examples==
{{See also|Lorentz scalar}}
In the current era, the immobility of [[Polaris]] (the North Star) under the [[diurnal motion]] of the [[celestial sphere]] is a classical illustration of physical invariance.

{{Quotation|For example the rule describing Newton's force of gravity between two chunks of matter is the same whether they are in this galaxy or another ([[translational invariance]] in space). It is also the same today as it was a million years ago (translational invariance in time). The law does not work differently depending on whether one chunk is east or north of the other one ([[rotational invariance]]). Nor does the law have to be changed depending on whether you measure the force between the two chunks in a railroad station, or do the same experiment with the two chunks on a uniformly moving train ([[principle of relativity]]).|[[David Mermin]]: ''It's About Time - Understanding Einstein's Relativity'', Chapter 1}}

Another example of a physical invariant is the [[speed of light]] under a [[Lorentz transformation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= French |first= A.P. |title= Special Relativity|year= 1968|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn= 0-393-09793-5|ref=harvnb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[time]] under a [[Galilean transformation]]. Such spacetime transformations represent shifts between the [[reference frames]] of different observers.

By [[Noether's theorem]] invariance of the action of a physical system under a [[continuous symmetry]] represents a fundamental [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]. For example, invariance under translation leads to [[conservation of momentum]], and invariance in time leads to [[conservation of energy]].

Quantities can be invariant under some common transformations but not under others. For example, the velocity of a particle is invariant when switching from rectangular coordinates to curvilinear coordinates, but is not invariant when transforming between frames of reference that are moving with respect to each other. Other quantities, like the speed of light, are always invariant.

==Importance==
Invariants are important in modern theoretical physics, and many theories are expressed in terms of their [[symmetry in physics|symmetries]] and invariants. 

[[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|Covariance and contravariance]] generalize the mathematical properties of [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariance]] in [[tensor|tensor mathematics]], and are frequently used in [[electromagnetism]], [[special relativity]], and [[general relativity]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2923">'''John Edward Jacob''' (born 1934 in [[Trout, Louisiana]]) was a [[United States of America|U.S.]] [[civil rights]] leader.  He served as the president of the [[National Urban League]] between 1982 and 1994.

Jacob received his B.A. and M.A. degrees from [[Howard University]] and was a [[social worker]] in [[Baltimore]] before joining the Urban League.  In 1965, he became director of education and youth incentives at the [[Washington, D.C.]] chapter.  Later he served as president and executive director of the San Diego Urban League.  In 1979 he became executive vice-president of the national office under [[Vernon Jordan]], whom he succeeded as president.

During his tenure as Urban League president, Jacob fought cutbacks in federal social programs and the weakening of civil rights enforcement under the [[Reagan Administration]].  In particular, he objected to the appointment of a conservative majority to the Civil Rights Commission that was hostile to vigorous protection of [[civil rights]], as well as the Justice Department's prosecutions of other public agencies engaged in affirmative action.

==Urban Marshall Plan==

In the early 1980s, Jacob helped develop a plan for urban recovery similar to the 1947 [[Marshall Plan]] initiated to assist European nations after World War II. Aid was sought from private sectors to facilitate entry-level job training programs, and Jacob proposed the League give direct assistance from its own resources to poverty-stricken minorities and whites, including housing and job placement. In addition, he recommended the federal government institute full employment through substantial public works and job training programs, and along with other civil rights groups, supported economic pressure in the corporate world to develop markets and jobs for minorities.

The son of a Baptist minister, Jacob was also an adherent of self-help.  He promoted [[SAT]] tutoring, comprehensive teenage pregnancy prevention, and a male responsibility program for fatherhood, to address issues contributing to the cycle of poverty in the [[African-American]] community.  Jacob added voter registration, education, and drug control to the League's agenda of priorities.

In contrast to Reagan, [[George H.W. Bush]] was initially receptive to Jacob's domestic Marshall Plan proposal, and Jacob welcomed dialogue with the new administration.  But Bush's veto of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1990]] soured the relationship.  The early 1990s also saw new court decisions and conservative political pressure against affirmative action policies the Urban League supported.

'''''Jus sanguinis''''' ({{lang-la|right of blood}}) is a principle of [[nationality law]] by which [[citizenship]] is not determined by place of birth but by having one or both parents who are citizens of the state. Children at birth may automatically be citizens if their parents have state citizenship or national identities of ethnic, cultural, or other origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KjqWJCE7JQUC&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |first=Dora |last=Kostakopoulou |title=The Future Governance of Citizenship |pages=26–27 |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizenship can also apply to children whose parents belong to a [[diaspora]] and were [[Right of return|not themselves citizens]] of the state conferring citizenship.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} This principle contrasts with ''[[jus soli]]'' (Latin: ''right of soil'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eudo-citizenship.eu/docs/birthright_comparativepaper.pdf |last1=Vink |first1=Maarten Peter |last2=de Groot |first2=Gerard-René |date=November 2010 |title=Birthright Citizenship: Trends and Regulations in Europe |location=Florence |publisher=European University Institute |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern development ==
At the end of the 19th century, the French-German debate on nationality saw the French, such as [[Ernest Renan]], oppose the German conception, exemplified by [[Johann Fichte]], who believed in an "objective nationality", based on [[heredity|blood]], [[race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[language]]. Renan's [[republicanism|republican]] conception, but perhaps also the presence of a German-speaking population in [[Alsace-Lorraine]], explains France's early adoption of ''jus soli''.

=== Mixed standards ===
Many nations have a mixture of ''jus sanguinis'' and ''jus soli'', including the [[United States nationality law|United States]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gansallo|first1=Ayodele|last2=Bernstein-Baker|first2=Judith|title=Understanding Immigration Law and Practice|date=2016|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business|isbn=9781454850380|page=570|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u90uDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA570|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canadian nationality law|Canada]], [[Israeli nationality law|Israel]], [[Greek nationality law|Greece]], the [[Irish nationality law|Republic of Ireland]], and recently [[German nationality law|Germany]]. Today [[French nationality law]] narrowly applies ''jus sanguinis,'' but it is still the most common means of passing on citizenship in many [[Continental Europe|continental European]] nations.

=== Complications due to imposed boundaries ===
Some modern European states which arose out of the dissolved [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]] or [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires have huge numbers of ethnic populations outside of their new 'national' boundaries, as do most of the [[former Soviet states]]. Such long-standing diasporas do not conform to codified 20th-century European rules of citizenship.

In many cases, ''jus sanguinis'' rights are mandated by international treaty, with citizenship definitions imposed by the international community. In other cases, minorities are subject to legal and extra-legal persecution and choose to immigrate to their ancestral home country. States offering ''jus sanguinis'' rights to ethnic citizens and their descendants include [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Turkey]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Armenia]]  and [[Romania]]. Each is required by international treaty to extend those rights.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

*{{flag|Estonia|name}}: Article 8 of Estonian constitution states every child with one parent who is an Estonian citizen shall have the right, by birth, to Estonian citizenship.
* {{flag|Finland|name}}: [[Finnish nationality law]]
*{{flag|Germany|name}}: Article 116(1) of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Basic Law]] confers, within the confines of the laws regulating the details, a right to citizenship upon any person who is admitted to Germany (in its borders of 1937) as "refugee or expellee of German ethnic origin or as the spouse or descendant of such a person." At one time, ethnic Germans living abroad in a country in the former [[Eastern Bloc]] (Aussiedler) could obtain citizenship through a virtually automatic procedure.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Federal Expellee Law]] ({{lang-de|Bundesvertriebenengesetz}}), §&amp;nbsp;6, specifies that also foreign citizens of states of the Eastern Bloc (and their desdendants), who were persecuted between 1945 and 1990 for their German ethnicity by their respective governments, are entitled to become Germans. The argument was that the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] had to administer to their needs because the respective governments in charge of guaranteeing their equal treatment as citizens severely neglected or contravened that obligation.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1990 the law has been steadily tightened to limit the number of immigrants each year. It now requires immigrants to prove language skills and cultural affiliation. Article 116(2) entitles persons (and their descendants), who were denaturalised by the Nazi government, to be renaturalised if they wish. Those among them who took their residence in Germany after May 8, 1945, are automatically to be considered as Germans. Both regulations, (1) and (2), provided for a considerable group of Poles and Israelis, residing in Poland and Israel, who are concurrently Germans.
*{{flag|Haiti|name}}: Every child born to a Haitian father or mother, no matter where he or she was born, is Haitian by the Haitian Constitution. This has been a big issue in the current Dominican nationality law; because of this and other factors, illegal migrants' children born in the DR of Haitian origin are considered non-Dominicans, and therefore Haitians.
*{{flag|Hungary|name}}: A person acquires Hungarian citizenship at birth if at least one parent is a Hungarian citizen. The place of birth is irrelevant.  Furthermore, Section 4(3) of the Act on Nationality permits ethnic Hungarians (defined as persons "at least one of whose relatives in ascendant line was a Hungarian citizen") to obtain citizenship on preferential terms after one year of residence. In addition, the "Status Law" of 2001 grants certain privileges to ethnic Hungarians living in territories that were once part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. It permits them to obtain an identification card but does not confer the right to full Hungarian citizenship. According to the latest Citizenship Law adopted in 2010, anybody, possessing certain evidences (certificates, documents) of his or her Hungarian roots from around the World can apply for Hungarian citizenship. The interview is led in Hungarian either in Hungary or at one of the Consulates abroad.
* {{flag|Iceland|name}}: [[Icelandic nationality law]]
*{{flag|India|name}}: A child born in India must have at least one parent who is an Indian citizen to be conferred citizenship. Earlier, people born in India were given citizenship regardless of the citizenship held by parents, but this was changed on 3 December 2004. Persons with at least one Indian grandparent may apply for a [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Person of Indian Origin]] card, provided that neither the applicant nor any ancestor has ever been a citizen of [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Afghanistan]], or [[China]]. The government may add other countries to the list. This card is a travel document and permits the holder to enter and stay in India without a visa, work, start a business, own land, and attend educational institutions, but it does not give the right to vote or hold office. In addition, persons of Indian origin who are nationals of countries not on the list may apply for [[Indian nationality law#Overseas citizenship of India|Overseas citizenship of India]], which confers similar rights and also permits the holder to apply for full Indian nationality after one year of residence.
*{{flag|Ireland|name}}: Under [[Irish nationality law]], any person with an Irish grandparent can become an Irish citizen by being registered in the Foreign Births Register at an Irish embassy or consular office, or at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin. Such an individual may also pass his entitlement to Irish nationality on to his children by registering in the Foreign Births Register, provided he or she registered as an Irish citizen with the Foreign Births Register before the birth of those children. The minister may also waive the usual requirements for naturalisation as an Irish citizen for those of "Irish descent or Irish associations" although this power is rarely used.
*{{flag|Iran|name}}: According to the [[Iranian nationality law]] the following persons are considered to be Iranian subjects: (1) All persons residing in Iran except those whose foreign nationality is established; the foreign nationality of such persons is considered to be established if their documents of nationality have not been objected to by the Iranian Government. (2) Those born in Iran or outside whose fathers are Iranian. (3) Those born in Iran of unknown parentage.(4)Persons born in Iran of foreign parents, one of whom was also born in Iran. (5) Persons born in Iran of a father of foreign nationality who have resided at least one more year in Iran immediately after reaching the full age of 18; in other cases their naturalization as Iranian subjects will be subject to the stipulations for Iranian naturalization laid down by the law. (6) Every woman of foreign nationality who marries an Iranian husband. (7) Every foreign national who has obtained Iranian nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.princeton.edu/irandataportal/laws/institutionsgovernance/nationality-law/ |title=Nationality Law: Article 976 |work=Iran Data Portal: Princeton University |year=2015 |accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Kenya: According to Article 14(1) of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 a person becomes a citizen by birth if on the day of the person birth either parent is a citizen of Kenya
*{{flag|Malta|name}}: [[Maltese nationality law]] grants citizenship to any person descended from "an ascendant who was born in Malta of a parent who was also born in Malta."
*{{flag|Mexico|name}}  The Mexican Constitution (Article 30) indicates that Mexicans are also persons born abroad, to a parent or parents who at that time were Mexicans born in Mexican territory. Also, a person born abroad is also Mexican, if at the time of birth either or both parents were Mexicans by naturalization. Mexico’s Constitution considers them Mexicans by birth.
* {{flag|Norway|name}}: [[Norwegian nationality law]]
* {{flag|Nigeria|name}}: According to the [[Constitution of Nigeria|Nigerian Constitution]], Chapter 3, section 25 1C
*{{flag|Philippines|name}}: The [[Philippine nationality law]] is based upon the principles of jus sanguinis (Latin: right of blood) and therefore descent from a parent who is a citizen or national of the [[Republic of the Philippines]] is the primary method of acquiring Philippine citizenship.
*{{flag|Poland|name}}: The definition of Polish citizenship has been based for years on article 34 of the Polish Constitution; this article is based on a '''jus sanguinis''' right to citizenship.&lt;ref name="Poland"&gt;English [http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/kon1.htm translation] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kMEKJXyM?url=http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/kon1.htm |date=7 October 2009 }} of the [[Constitution of Poland|Polish Constitution]].&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, any child born by Polish parent(s) is a ''de jure'' citizen of Poland. In 1967–1968 the Communist State issued to Jews emigrating from Poland to Israel, instead of passports, a so-called travel document which granted them the right to exit Poland but not of re-entering it, in effect taking away their Polish citizenship on the assumption that, in emigrating or traveling to Israel, they renounced it themselves. In a 2005 verdict, the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Poland]] ruled that this action was illegal based on the state of law at that time. Consequently, it is now assumed the Jews who emigrated after 1968 have remained Polish citizens and their citizenship will be certified on request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wprost.pl/ar/124944/Emigrantom-z-1968-roku-zostana-zwrocone-obywatelstwa/ |title=Emigrantom z 1968 roku zostaną zwrócone obywatelstwa |trans-title=Polish citizenship reinstated to emigrants from 1968 |work=[[Wprost]] |date=4 March 2008 |accessdate=6 October 2015 |language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|Romania|name}}: [[Romanian nationality law]]
*{{flag|Slovakia|name}}: Persons with at least one Slovak grandparent and "Slovak cultural and language awareness" may apply for an expatriate identity card entitling them to live, work, study and own land in Slovakia. Expatriate status is not full citizenship and does not entitle the holder to vote, but a holder who moves his or her domicile to Slovakia may obtain citizenship under preferential terms.  Slovakia grants full Slovak citizenship to children of Slovak parents (one or both parents) irrespective of the place of birth.
*{{flag|South Korea|name}}: [[South Korean nationality law]]
* {{flag|Sweden|name}}: [[Swedish nationality law]]
*{{flag|Switzerland|name}}: [[Swiss nationality law#Jus sanguinis|Swiss nationality law]] is exceptionally restrictive: someone who was born in Switzerland and has spent their entire life there has no automatic right to Swiss citizenship if neither of their parents are Swiss citizens, even if their parents are permanent residents or have themselves spent their entire lives in Switzerland. In fact, the citizenship criteria are simpler for a foreigner with no previous ties to Switzerland who marries a Swiss citizen, than for people born and raised in Switzerland but with foreign parents. Due to Switzerland's [[Immigration to Switzerland|high immigrant population]], there are more than a million people who were born and have spent their entire lives in Switzerland but are not Swiss citizens due to their parents being immigrants. Some Swiss-born third-generation immigrants even have Swiss-born parents but are not Swiss citizens if neither of their parents have naturalised. To obtain Swiss citizenship, people in this position must undergo [[Swiss nationality law#Naturalisation|naturalisation proceedings]], which have a high bar to satisfy the "integration" criterion. The unusual rules hit international headlines in 2017 when a woman born in Switzerland to [[Turkey|Turkish]] parents, who is a native [[Swiss German|Swiss-German]] speaker and has spent her entire life in Switzerland, had her citizenship application denied by the local municipality on "integration" grounds as she could not name enough Swiss mountains, cheeses and retail brands, and was deemed not to have gone skiing often enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/aargau/aarau/das-einbuergerungs-protokoll-diese-92-fragen-musste-funda-yilmaz-beantworten-131524081|title=Das Einbürgerungs-Protokoll: Diese 92 Fragen musste Funda Yilmaz beantworten|work=az Aargauer Zeitung|access-date=2018-04-06|language=de-CH|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406232859/https://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/aargau/aarau/das-einbuergerungs-protokoll-diese-92-fragen-musste-funda-yilmaz-beantworten-131524081|archive-date=6 April 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was overruled by the cantonal government several months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/naturalisation-row_decision-to-deny-citizenship-to-turkish-woman-reversed/43609038|title=Decision to deny citizenship to Turkish woman reversed|last=agencies|first=swissinfo.ch and|work=SWI swissinfo.ch|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407053402/https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/naturalisation-row_decision-to-deny-citizenship-to-turkish-woman-reversed/43609038|archive-date=7 April 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Swiss voters in a nationwide [[Swiss referendums, 2017|referendum]] agreed to relax the citizenship criteria for third-generation immigrants: although they will still not be Swiss citizens at birth and will need to apply for citizenship, they will no longer have to take naturalisation tests or interviews if their parents ''and'' grandparents are long-time permanent residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38947518|title=Swiss vote for relaxed citizenship laws|date=2017-02-12|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616002429/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38947518|archive-date=16 June 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/votes/20170212/Federal-Decree-on-the-Simplified-Naturalisation-of-Third-Generation-Immigrants.html|title=Federal Decree on the Simplified Naturalisation of Third-Generation Immigrants|last=Council|first=The Federal|website=www.admin.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406230728/https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/votes/20170212/Federal-Decree-on-the-Simplified-Naturalisation-of-Third-Generation-Immigrants.html|archive-date=6 April 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|Thailand|name}}: [[Thai nationality law]]
*{{flag|Tunisia|name}}: When one of the parents is Tunisian, a child is considered Tunisian regardless of the child’s place of birth or whether the child has acquired the nationality of another country. Children with at least one Tunisian parent, no matter where they are born, are considered Tunisian citizens, and must travel to and from Tunisia only with a Tunisian passport.
*{{flag|Ukraine|name}}: Article 8 of the Law on Citizenship of Ukraine permits any person with at least one Ukrainian grandparent to become a citizen upon renunciation of the former nationality.
*{{flag|United Kingdom|name}}: By birth abroad, which constitutes "by descent" if one of the parents is a British citizen otherwise than by descent (for example by birth, adoption, registration or naturalisation in the UK). British citizenship by descent is only transferable to one generation down from the parent who is a British citizen otherwise than by descent, if the child is born abroad.
*{{flag|United States|name}}: [[United States nationality law]] states that a child born abroad is given United States citizenship if at least one parent is a citizen or national, subject to certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Acquisition-US-Citizenship-Child-Born-Abroad.html|title=Acquisition of U.S. Citizenship by a Child Born Abroad|author=|date=|website=travel.state.gov|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leges sanguinis states today ==
Many countries provide citizenship on preferential terms to individuals with ethnic ties to these countries (so-called ''leges sanguinis''):
*{{flag|Afghanistan|name}}: Connection to the Afghan diaspora. There have been controversial proposals to people of [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] origin.
*{{flag|Armenia|name}}: Article 14 of the [[Constitution of the Republic of Armenia]] (1995) provides that "individuals of Armenian origin shall acquire citizenship of the Republic of Armenia through a simplified procedure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/am00000_.html |title=Constitution of the Republic of Armenia |work=International Constitutional Law Project |date=5 July 1995 |accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provision is consistent with the [[Declaration on Independence of Armenia]], issued by the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Armenia in 1989, which declared at article 4 that "Armenians living abroad are entitled to the citizenship of the Republic of Armenia".
*{{flag|Bulgaria|name}}: Article 25 of the 1991 constitution specifies that a "person of Bulgarian origin shall acquire Bulgarian citizenship through a facilitated procedure." Article 15 of the Law on Bulgarian Citizenship provides that an individual "of Bulgarian origin" (ethnicity) may be naturalized without any waiting period and without having to show a source of income, knowledge of the Bulgarian language, or renunciation of his former citizenship. This approach has been a tradition since the new constitutional foundation of Bulgaria in 1879, following the liberation from Ottoman yoke in 1878, when large numbers of ethnic Bulgarians remained outside of the state borders. Bulgaria and Greece were subject to a population exchange following the [[Second Balkan War]]. The conditions of the treaty settlement mandated that they accept individuals claiming respective ethnic origin.
*{{flag|Croatia|name}}: Article 11 of the Law on Croatian Citizenship allows emigrants and their descendants to acquire Croatian nationality upon return, without passing a language examination or renouncing former citizenship. In addition, Article 16 allows ethnic Croats living outside Croatia to "acquire Croatian citizenship" by making a written declaration and by submitting proof of attachment to Croatian culture.
*{{flag|Finland|name}}: Finnish law provides a [[right of return]] to ethnic Finns from the former Soviet Union, including [[Ingrian Finns|Ingrians]]. Applicants must now pass an examination in one of the official languages of the country, Finnish or Swedish. Certain persons of Finnish descent who live outside the former Soviet Union also have the right to establish permanent residency, which would eventually entitle them to qualify for citizenship.
*{{flag|Greece|name}}: Ethnic Greeks can obtain Greek citizenship by two methods under the Code of Greek Nationality. Article 5 allows ethnic Greeks who are stateless (which, in practice, includes those who voluntarily renounce their nationality) to obtain citizenship upon application to a Greek consular official. In addition, ethnic Greeks who join the armed forces acquire automatic citizenship by operation of Article 10, with the military oath taking the place of the citizenship oath. This position arises from the fact that approximately 85% of known ethnic Greeks were outside the boundaries when the country was formed, and 40% remained outside the final boundaries at the beginning of [[World War I]]. Most were ''de jure'' stripped of their host country citizenship with the outbreak of war if the host country was at war with Greece. In the late 19th century, Greece had a wider diaspora because of poverty and limited opportunities.
*{{flag|Ireland|name}} While the child or a grandchild of an Irish citizen parent is automatically Irish, Section 16(a) of the [[Irish nationality law|Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act]] permits the Minister of Justice, at their discretion, to waive the residence requirements for a person "of Irish descent or associations".
*{{flag|Israel|name}}: The [[Law of Return]] offers citizenship to any Jew (see [[Who is a Jew?#Law_of_Return|Who is a Jew under the Law of Return?]]) wishing to immigrate. Exceptions can be made for those considered by the Minister of Interior to be a threat to the welfare or security of the state. Israeli law also recognizes the descendants of Israeli emigrants living abroad as Israelis; this applies only to the first generation born abroad. Non-jews can become naturalized after five years' of residency and acquisition of a basic knowledge of [[Hebrew]].
*{{flag|Italy|name}}: The [[Italian nationality law|nationality law of Italy]] bestows citizenship ''jure sanguinis''. There is no limit of generations for the citizenship via blood. However, the first citizens of the modern Italian state were alive on 17 March 1861 when the state was officially formed, and for this reason all claims of Italian citizenship by jure sanguinis must stem from an ancestor who was living after 16 March 1861. Each descendant of the ancestor through whom citizenship is claimed ''jure sanguinis'' could pass Italian citizenship to the next generation only if this descendant was entitled to Italian citizenship at the time of the birth of the next person in the line. So if any person in the line lost the Italian citizenship and then had a child, that child did not inherit Italian citizenship ''jure sanguinis'', except if the child could inherit the citizenship from the other parent. Cases of dual citizenship were possible, which is to say, for example, that a person in the line could have had Italian and Canadian citizenship concurrently. Minor children of Italian citizens were at risk of losing Italian citizenship if the child's parent naturalized in another country, unless the child was subject to an exception to this risk—and children born and residing in a country where they held dual citizenship by [[jus soli]] were subject to such an exception since 1 July 1912.  Until 1 January 1948, Italian law did not generally permit women to pass on citizenship. Persons born before that date are in most cases not Italian citizens ''jure sanguinis'' if their line of descent from an Italian citizen depends on a female at some point before 1948.  On several occasions, this limitation of deriving Italian citizenship only from fathers before 1948 has been successfully challenged in court.
*{{flag|Kiribati|name}}: Articles 19 and 23 of the constitution provides, "Every person of I-Kiribati descent... shall... become or have and continue to have thereafter the right to become a citizen of Kiribati.... Every person of I-Kiribati descent who does not become a citizen of Kiribati on Independence Day... shall, at any time thereafter, be entitled upon making application in such manner as may be prescribed to be registered as a citizen of Kiribati."
*{{flag|Liberia|name}}: the [[Constitution of Liberia|Liberian constitution]] allows only [[Negro]]s (regardless of cultural or national affiliation) to become citizens, though people of other races may live in Liberia as permanent residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Analysis of the Aliens and Nationality Law of the Republic of Liberia|ssrn = 1795122|date = 2009-05-01|location = Rochester, NY|first = Jessie|last = Tannenbaum|first2 = Anthony|last2 = Valcke|first3 = Andrew|last3 = McPherson}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|Lithuania|name}}: The Constitution of Lithuania grants a right to citizenship to foreigners of ethnic Lithuanian origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/lh00000_.html |title=Constitution of Lithuania: Article 32(4) |work=International Constitutional Law Project |date=25 October 1992 |accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|Rwanda|name}}: The Rwandan constitution provides that "[a]ll persons originating from Rwanda and their descendants shall, upon their request, be entitled to Rwandan nationality."
*{{flag|Serbia|name}}: Article 23 of the 2004 citizenship law provides that the descendants of emigrants from Serbia, or ethnic Serbs residing abroad, may take up citizenship upon written declaration.
*{{flag|Spain|name}}: A Spanish law passed in 2015 allows individuals who can prove descent from the [[Sephardic Jews]] who were exiled in 1492 following the [[Alhambra Decree]] and who can show a "special link" to Spain to apply for dual citizenship. Spain had previously allowed application for such individuals but had required that they give up their citizenship from their other country. The new law has no such requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-spain-sephardic-jews-20151001-story.html|title=Welcome home, 500 years later: Spain offers citizenship to Sephardic Jews|first=Henry|last=Chu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|South Korea|name}}: [[South Korean nationality law]] grants special status to ethnic [[Koreans]] and their descendants in the [[Korean diaspora]]. Under the [[Constitution of South Korea]], North Korea is part of Republic of Korea. Therefore, North Korean citizens are also recognized as South Korean nationals. All North Koreans of good conduct are granted citizenship upon arrival to South Korea.
*{{flag|Turkey|name}}: Turkish law allows persons of Turkish origin and their spouse and children, to apply for naturalization without the five-year waiting period applicable to other immigrants. Turkey and Greece reciprocally expelled their minorities in the early 1920s after World War I.  They were mandated by international treaty to accept incoming populations as citizens based on ethnic background.

== Importance of land change modeling ==
[[File:Spycharka DT 75.JPG|thumb|Bulldozers are often used to clear land for development or agriculture.]]
Changes in [[land systems]] have consequences for climate and environmental change on every scale. Therefore, decisions and policies in relation to land systems are very important for reacting these changes and working towards a more sustainable society and planet.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advancing Land Change Modeling: Opportunities and Research Requirements|last=Brown et al.|first=Daniel G.|publisher=The National Academic Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-309-28833-0|location=Washington, DC|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Land change models are significant in their ability to help guide the land systems to positive societal and environmental outcomes at a time when attention to changes across land systems is increasing.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Briassoulis|first=Helen|date=2000-01-01|title=Analysis of Land Use Change: Theoretical and Modeling Approaches|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/bookchap/rriwholbk/17.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A plethora of science and practitioner communities have been able to advance the amount and quality of data in land change modeling in the past few decades. That has influenced the development of methods and technologies in model land change. The multitudes of land change models that have been developed are significant in their ability to address land system change and useful in various science and practitioner communities.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

For the science community, land change models are important in their ability to test theories and concepts of land change and its connections to human-environment relationships, as well as explore how these dynamics will change future land systems without real-world observation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Land change modeling is useful to explore spatial land systems, uses, and covers. Land change modeling can account for complexity within dynamics of land use and land cover by linking with climactic, ecological, biogeochemical, biogeophysical and socioeconomic models. Additionally, LCMs are able to produce spatially explicit outcomes according to the type and complexity within the land system dynamics within the spatial extent. Many biophysical and socioeconomic variables influence and produce a variety of outcomes in land change modeling.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Model uncertainty ==
[[File:Uriage Land Cover Change.png|thumb|300x300px|Land change is visible in this image from Japan. Models cannot be as certain as satellite imagery.]]
A notable property of all land change models is that they have some irreducible level of uncertainty in the model structure, parameter values, and/or input data. For instance, one uncertainty within land change models is a result from [[wikt:temporal|temporal]] non-stationarity that exists in land change processes, so the further into the future the model is applied, the more uncertain it is.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advancing Land Change Modeling: Opportunities and Research Requirements|last=Brown et al.|first=Daniel G.|publisher=The National Academic Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-309-28833-0|location=Washington, DC|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=XiaoHang|last2=Andersson|first2=Claes|date=2004-01-01|title=Assessing the impact of temporal dynamics on land-use change modeling|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971502000455|journal=Computers, Environment and Urban Systems|series=Geosimulation|volume=28|issue=1–2|pages=107–124|doi=10.1016/S0198-9715(02)00045-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another uncertainty within land change models are data and [[parameter]] uncertainties within physical principles (i.e., surface typology), which leads to uncertainties in being able to understand and predict physical processes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Furthermore, land change model design are a product of both decision-making and physical processes. Human-induced impact on the socio-economic and ecological environment is important to take into account, as it is constantly changing land cover and sometimes model uncertainty. To avoid model uncertainty and interpret model outputs more accurately, a model diagnosis is used to understand more about the connections between land change models and the actual land system of the spatial extent. The overall importance of model diagnosis with model uncertainty issues is its ability to assess how interacting processes and the landscape are represented, as well as the uncertainty within the landscape and its processes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Approaches to land change modeling ==

=== Machine learning &amp; statistical models ===
A [[Machine learning|machine-learning approach]] uses land-cover data from the past to try to assess how land will change in the future, and works best with large datasets. There are multiple types of machine-learning and statistical models - a study in western Mexico from 2011 found that results from two outwardly similar models were considerably different, as one used a [[Artificial neural network|neural network]] and the other used a simple weights-of-evidence model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pérez-Vega|first=Azucena|last2=Mas|first2=Jean-François|last3=Ligmann-Zielinska|first3=Arika|date=2012-03-01|title=Comparing two approaches to land use/cover change modeling and their implications for the assessment of biodiversity loss in a deciduous tropical forest|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136481521100209X|journal=Environmental Modelling &amp; Software|volume=29|issue=1|pages=11–23|doi=10.1016/j.envsoft.2011.09.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cellular models ===
A [[Cellular automaton|cellular]] land change model uses maps of suitability for various types of land use, and compares areas that are immediately adjacent to one another to project changes into the future. Variations in the scale of cells in a cellular model can have significant impacts on model outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pan|first=Ying|last2=Roth|first2=Andreas|last3=Yu|first3=Zhenrong|last4=Doluschitz|first4=Reiner|date=2010-08-01|title=The impact of variation in scale on the behavior of a cellular automata used for land use change modeling|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971510000244|journal=Computers, Environment and Urban Systems|volume=34|issue=5|pages=400–408|doi=10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2010.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sector-based &amp; spatially disaggregated economic models ===
Economic models are built on principles of [[supply and demand]]. They use mathematical parameters in order to predict what land types will be desired and which will be discarded. These are frequently built for urban areas, such as a 2003 study of the highly dense [[Pearl River Delta]] in southern [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seto|first=Karen C.|last2=Kaufmann|first2=Robert K.|date=2003-02-01|title=Modeling the Drivers of Urban Land Use Change in the Pearl River Delta, China: Integrating Remote Sensing with Socioeconomic Data|url=http://le.uwpress.org/content/79/1/106|journal=Land Economics|language=en|volume=79|issue=1|pages=106–121|doi=10.2307/3147108|issn=0023-7639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agent-based models ===
Agent-based models try to simulate the behavior of many individuals making independent choices, and then see how those choices affect the landscape as a whole. Agent-based modeling can be complex - for instance, a 2005 study combined an agent-based model with computer-based [[genetic programming]] to explore land change in the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatan peninsula]] of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manson|first=Steven M.|date=2005-12-01|title=Agent-based modeling and genetic programming for modeling land change in the Southern Yucatán Peninsular Region of Mexico|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880905002422|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment|volume=111|issue=1–4|pages=47–62|doi=10.1016/j.agee.2005.04.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hybrid approaches ===
Many models do not limit themselves to one of the approaches above - they may combine several in order to develop a fully comprehensive and accurate model.

== Implementation opportunities for land change modeling ==

Scientists use LCMs to build and test theories in land change modeling for a variety of human and environmental dynamics.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advancing Land Change Modeling: Opportunities and Research Requirements|last=Brown et al.|first=Daniel|publisher=The National Academy of Sciences|year=2014|isbn=978-0-309-28833-0|location=500 Fifth Street, N.W. Washington, DC 20001|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Land change modeling has a variety of implementation opportunities in many science and practice disciplines, such as in decision-making, policy, and in real-world application in public and private domains. The science disciplines use LCMs to formalize and test land change theory, and the explore and experiment with different scenarios of land change modeling. The practical disciplines use LCMs to analyze current land change trends and explore future outcomes from policies or actions in order to set appropriate guidelines, limits and principles for policy and action. Research and practitioner communities may study land change to address topics related to land-climate interactions, water quantity and quality, food and fiber production, and urbanization, infrastructure, and the built environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Improvement and advancement of land change modeling ==

=== Improved land observational strategies ===
[[File:Markham-suburbs aerial-edit2.jpg|thumb|Aerial photography can be used in conjunction with satellite imagery and ground data to improve land change models.]]
One improvement for land change modeling can be made through better data and integration with available data and models. Improved observational data can influence modeling quality. Finer spatial and temporal resolution data that can integrate with [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] and biogeophysical data can help land change modeling couple the socioeconomic and biogeological modeling types. Land change modelers should value data at finer scales. Fine data can give a better conceptual understanding of underlying constructs of the model and capture additional dimensions of land use. It is important to maintain the temporal and spatial continuity of data from airborne-based and survey-based observation through constellations of smaller satellite coverage, image processing algorithms, and other new data to link [[Satellite imagery|satellite-based]] land use information and land management information. It is also important to have better information on land change actors and their beliefs, preferences, and behaviors to improve the predictive ability of models and evaluate the consequences of alternative policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown et al.|first=Daniel|date=October 2013|title=Opportunities to improve impact, integration, and evaluation of land change models|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2013.07.012|journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability|volume=5|pages=452–457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aligning model choices with model goals ===
One important improvement for land change modeling can be made though better aligning model choices with model goals. It is important to choose the appropriate modeling approach based on the scientific and application contexts of the specific study of interest. For example, when someone needs to design a model with policy and policy actors in mind, they may choose an agent-based model. Here, structural economic or agent-based approaches are useful, but specific patterns and trends in land change as with many ecological systems may not be as useful. When one needs to grasp the early stages of problem identification, and thus needs to understand the scientific patterns and trend of land change, machine learning and cellular approaches are useful.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Integrating positive and normative approaches ===
Land Change Modeling should also better integrate positive and normative approaches to explanation and prediction based on evidence-based accounts of land systems. It should also integrate optimization approaches to explore the outcomes that are the most beneficial and the processes that might produce those outcomes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Integrating across scales ===
It is important to better integrate data across scales. A models design is based on the dominant processes and data from a specific scale of application and spatial extent. Cross-scale dynamics and feedbacks between temporal and spatial scales influences the patterns and processes of the model. Process like tele-coupling, indirect land use change, and adaption to climate change at multiple scales requires better representation by cross-scale dynamics. Implementing these processes will require a better understanding of feedback mechanisms across scales.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Opportunities in research infrastructure and cyberinfrastructure support ===
As there is continuous reinvention of modeling environments, frameworks, and platforms, land change modeling can improve from better research infrastructure support. For example, model and [[Software development process|software infrastructure development]] can help avoid duplication of initiatives by land change modeling community members, co-learn about land change modeling, and integrate models to evaluate impacts of land change. Better data infrastructure can provide more data resources to support compilation, curation, and comparison of heterogeneous data sources. Better community modeling and governance can advance decision-making and modeling capabilities within a community with specific and achievable goals. Community modeling and [[Community government|governance]] would provide a step towards reaching community agreement on specific goals to move modeling and data capabilities forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advancing Land Change Modeling: Opportunities and Research Requirements|last=Brown et al.|first=Daniel G|publisher=The National Academic Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-309-28833-0|location=Washington, DC|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of modern challenges in land change modeling can potentially be addressed through contemporary advances in cyberinfrastructure such as crowd-source, “mining” for distributed data, and improving [[High Performance Computing|high-performance computing]]. Because it is important for modelers to find more data to better construct, calibrate, and validate structural models, the ability to analyze large amount of data on individual behaviors is helpful. For example, modelers can find point-of-sales data on individual purchases by consumers and internet activities that reveal social networks. However, some issues of privacy and propriety for crowdsourcing improvements have not yet been resolved.

The land change modeling community can also benefit from Global Positioning System and Internet-enabled mobile device data distribution. Combining various structural-based data-collecting methods can improve the availability of microdata and the diversity of people that see the findings and outcomes of land change modeling projects. For example, [[Crowdsourcing|citizen-contributed data]] supported the implementation of [[Ushahidi]] in [[Haiti]] after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]], helping at least 4,000 disaster events. Universities, non-profit agencies, and volunteers are needed to collect information on events like this to make positive outcomes and improvements in land change modeling and land change modeling applications. Tools such as mobile devices are available to make it easier for participants to participate in collecting micro-data on agents. [[Google Maps]] uses cloud-based mapping technologies with datasets that are co-produced by the public and scientists. Examples in agriculture such as coffee farmers in Avaaj Otalo showed use of mobile phones for collecting information and as an interactive voice.

Cyberinfrastructure developments may also increase the ability of land change modeling to meet computational demands of various modeling approaches given increasing data volumes and certain expected model interactions. For example, improving the development of processors, data storage, network bandwidth, and coupling land change and environmental process models at high resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advancing Land Change Modeling: Opportunities and Research Requirements|last=Brown et al.|first=Daniel G.|publisher=The National Academic Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-309-28833-0|location=Washington, DC|pages=90–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Model evaluation ===
An additional way to improve land change modeling is through improvement of [[Evaluation|model evaluation]] approaches. Improvement in [[sensitivity analysis]] is needed to gain a better understand of the variation in model output in response to model elements like input data, model parameters, initial conditions, boundary conditions, and model structure. Improvement in [[Pattern recognition|pattern validation]] can help land change modelers make comparisons between model outputs parameterized for some historic case, like maps, and observations for that case. Improvement in uncertainty sources is needed to improve forecasting of future states that are non-stationary in processes, input variables, and boundary conditions. One can explicitly recognize stationarity assumptions and explore data for evidence in non-stationarity to better acknowledge and understand model uncertainty to improve uncertainty sources. Improvement in structural validation can help improve acknowledgement and understanding of the processes in the model and the processes operating in the real world through a combination of qualitative and quantitative measures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In [[ethology]] and [[social science]], '''male bonding''' is the formation of close personal relationships, and patterns of [[friendship]] or cooperation between males.

In the context of human relationships, male bonding is used to describe friendship between men, or the way in which men befriend each other. The expression is sometimes used synonymously with the word [[camaraderie]]. The first widely noticed use of the term was in ''Men in Groups'' (1969; 2004) by anthropologist [[Lionel Tiger]].

Male bonding can take place in various locations such as gyms, locker rooms, sport fields or courts, fraternities, and barbershops. This can include playing musical instruments, video games, business ventures, creative endeavors, journeys, quests, sporting activities, fishing, hunting, camping, gambling, social drinking, smoking cigars, working with tools, or even just conversing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4508">A '''manufacturing supermarket''' (or market location) is, for a factory process, what a retail supermarket is for the customer. The customers draw products from the 'shelves' as needed and this can be detected by the supplier who then initiates a replenishment of that item. It was the observation that this 'way of working' could be transferred from retail to manufacturing that is one of the cornerstones of the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS).

== History ==

In the 1950s Toyota sent teams to the United States to learn how they achieved mass-production. However, the Toyota Delegation first got inspiration for their production system at an American Supermarket (a Piggly Wiggly, to be precise). They saw the virtue in the supermarket only reordering and restocking goods once they’d been bought by customers.

In a supermarket (like the TPS) customers (processes) buy what they need when they need it. Since the system is self-service the sales effort (materials management) is reduced. The shelves are refilled as products are sold (parts withdrawn) on the assumption that what has sold will sell again which makes it easy to see how much has been used and to avoid overstocking. The most important feature of a supermarket system is that stocking is triggered by actual demand. In the TPS this signal triggers the 'pull' system of production.&lt;ref&gt;A study of the Toyota Production System, Shigeo Shingo, Production Press, 1989, p 90&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==

Market locations are appropriate where there is a desire to communicate customer pull up the supply chain. The aim of the 'market' is to send single unit consumption signals back up the supply chain so that a demand leveling effect occurs. Just as in a supermarket it is possible for someone to decide to cater for a party of 300 from the supermarket so it is possible to decide to suddenly fill ten trucks and send massively distorting signals up those same pathways. Thus the 'market location' can be used as a sort of isolator between actual demand and how supply would like demand to be, an isolator between batch demand spikes and the up upstream supply process.&lt;ref&gt;The Gold Mine, F &amp; M Ballé, Lean Enterprise Institute, 2005, p190&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if the market were positioned at the loading bay, then it will receive 'spikes' of demand whenever a truck comes in to be loaded. Since, in general, one knows in advance when trucks will arrive and what they will require to be loaded onto them, it is possible to spread that demand spike over a chosen period before the truck actually arrives. It is possible to do this by designating a location, say a marked floor area, to be the 'virtual' truck and moving items from the market to the 'virtual truck' smoothly over the chosen period prior to the load onto the actual truck commencing. Smoothly here means that for each item its 'loading' is evenly spread across the period. For regular shipments this period might start the moment the last shipment in that schedule departs the loading bay. This has four key impacts:

# ''Loading movements rise'', which is the reason often given for not doing this 'virtual' truck loading;
# ''Demand evenness ([[Mura (Japanese term)|Mura]]) increases'' which allows stock reductions and exposes new issues to be resolved;
# ''Any last minute searching for items to load is eliminated'' since before the real truck need to be loaded the 'virtual' truck will have completed its loading;
# ''Any potential shortages that may affect the shipment can be exposed earlier'' by the '[[stockout]]' in the market location. This is true because the 'virtual' truck loading sequence will be constructed to fit with the supply process tempo.

This logic can, obviously, be applied upstream of any batch process and not just deliveries to another plant. It is a workaround for the fact that the batch process hasn't been made to flow yet. It therefore has some costs but the benefits in terms of reducing the three wastes should outweigh these.

Toyota use this technique and demand it of their suppliers in order to generate focus on the supply issues it uncovers. They then demand the preparation of loads for more frequent 'virtual' trucks than will actually appear in order to raise this pressure (see [[Frequent deliveries]]).

At low stocking levels for some items the 'market location' can require [[Just in Sequence]] supply rather than [[Just-in-time (business)|Just in Time]].

{{Theosophy}}

The '''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom''' are reputed to be [[Spiritual enlightenment|enlightened]] beings originally identified by the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[Henry S. Olcott]], [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]], and others. These Theosophists claimed to have met some of the so-called ''Masters'' during their lifetimes in different parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. page 249"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India: 1925--Theosophical Publishing House--Diagram 5, Facing page 248, provides details about the "Great Ones" functioning on [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiation levels five through nine]]. C.W. Leadbeater’s Spiritual Hierarchy Chart (The Bodhisattva=Maitreya)&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they are referred to by Theosophists as ''Elder Brothers of the Human Race'', ''Adepts'', [[Mahātmā|''Mahatmas'']], or simply as ''The Masters''.

Helena Blavatsky was the first person to introduce the concept of the Masters to the West. At first she talked about them privately, but she stated that after a few years two of these adepts, [[Kuthumi]] (K.H.) and [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]] (M.), agreed to maintain a correspondence with two British Theosophists – Alfred P. Sinnett and A. O. Hume. This communication took place from 1880 to 1885, and during those years the reputed existence and objectives of the Mahatmas became public. The original letters are currently kept in the [[British Library]] in [[London]] and have been published as the ''[[Mahatma Letters]]''.

==Skeptical view==
[[K. Paul Johnson]] suggests in his book ''The Masters Revealed: Madam Blavatsky and Myth of the Great White Brotherhood'' that the Masters that Madam Blavatsky claimed she had personally met are idealizations of certain people she had met during her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, K. Paul ''The Masters Revealed: Madam Blavatsky and Myth of the Great White Brotherhood'' Albany, New York: 1994 State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4866">The '''"Appeal to womanhood throughout the world"'''&lt;ref name="appeal"/&gt; (later known as '''"Mother's Day Proclamation"''') by [[Julia Ward Howe]] was an appeal for women to unite for peace in the world. Written in 1870, Howe's "Appeal to womanhood" was a pacifist reaction to the carnage of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The appeal was tied to Howe's [[feminist]] conviction that women had a responsibility to shape their societies at the political level.

In 1872 Howe asked for the celebration of a "Mother's Day for Peace" on 2 June of every year, but she was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="leigh"&gt;{{cite book | title = Consumer Rites: The Buying and Selling of American Holidays | author = LEIGH Eric Schmidt | edition = reprint, illustrated | editor = [[Princeton University Press]] | year = 1997 | pages = 252, 348 (footnote 17 of chapter 5) | isbn = 978-0-691-01721-1 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=maF8mTPsJqsC }} citing Deborah Pickman Clifford, ''Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory: A Biography of Julia Ward Howe (Boston: Little, Brown, 1979), 187, 207, and Julia Ward Howe, "How the Fourth of July Should Be Celebrated", ''Forum'' 15 (July 1983); 574&lt;/ref&gt; The modern [[Mother's Day]] is an unrelated celebration and it was established by [[Anna Jarvis]] years later.&lt;ref name="leigh"/&gt;

Today, the appeal is included in the [[Unitarian Universalist]] hymnal ''[[Singing the Living Tradition]]''.

==Appeal to womanhood throughout the world==
{{quote|1=Again, in the sight of the Christian world, have the skill and power of two great nations exhausted themselves in mutual murder. Again have the sacred questions of international justice been committed to the fatal mediation of military weapons. In this day of progress, in this century of light, the ambition of rulers has been allowed to barter the dear interests of domestic life for the bloody exchanges of the battle field. Thus men have done. Thus men will do. But women need no longer be made a party to proceedings which fill the globe with grief and horror. Despite the assumptions of physical force, the mother has a sacred and commanding word to say to the sons who owe their life to her suffering. That word should now be heard, and answered to as never before.

Arise, then, Christian women of this day ! Arise, all women who have hearts, Whether your baptism be that of water or of tears ! Say firmly : We will not have great questions decided by irrelevant agencies. Our husbands shall not come to us, reeking with carnage, for caresses and applause. Our sons shall not be taken from us to unlearn all that we have been able to teach them of charity, mercy and patience. We, women of one country, will be too tender of those of another country, to allow our sons to be trained to injure theirs. From the bosom of the devastated earth a voice goes up with our own. It says: Disarm, disarm! The sword of murder is not the balance of justice. Blood does not wipe out dishonor, nor violence vindicate possession. As men have often forsaken the plough and the anvil at the summons of war, let women now leave all that may be left of home for a great and earnest day of council.

Let them meet first, as women, to bewail and commemorate the dead. Let them then solemnly take council with each other as to the means whereby the great human family can live in peace, man as the brother of man, each bearing after his own kind the sacred impress, not of Caesar, but of God.

In the name of womanhood and of humanity, I earnestly ask that a general congress of women, without limit of nationality, may be appointed and held at some place deemed most convenient, and at the earliest period consistent with its objects, to promote the alliance of the different nationalities, the amicable settlement of international questions, the great and general interests of peace.|2=Julia Ward Howe&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;{{citation |title= Appeal to womanhood throughout the world |publisher= Library of Congress |author= Julia Ward Howe |date= September 1870 |work= An American Time Capsule: Three Centuries of Broadsides and Other Printed Ephemera |url= http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/h?ammem/rbpebib:@field(NUMBER+@band(rbpe+07400300))}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Julia Ward.

The '''National Museum of Iraq''' ([[Arabic]]: المتحف العراقي) is a museum located in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]].  Also known as the '''Iraq Museum''', it contains precious relics from the [[Mesopotamia]]n, [[Babylonia]]n and [[Persia]]n civilization. It was [[Archaeological looting in Iraq|looted]] during and after the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]]. Despite international efforts, only some of the stolen artifacts were returned. After being closed for many years while being refurbished, and rarely open for public viewing, the museum was officially reopened in February 2015.

==Foundation==
After [[World War I]], [[archaeology|archaeologists]] from [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] began several excavations throughout Iraq. In an effort to keep those findings from leaving Iraq, British traveller, intelligence agent, archaeologist, and author [[Gertrude Bell]] began collecting the artifacts in a government building in Baghdad in 1922. In 1926, the Iraqi government moved the collection to a new building and established the Baghdad Antiquities Museum, with Bell as its director.&lt;ref name = "Britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/405113/National-Museum-of-Iraq "National Museum of Iraq"].  [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Retrieved February 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Bell died later that year; the new director was [[Sidney Smith (Assyriologist)|Sidney Smith]].

In 1966, the collection was moved again, to a two-story, {{convert|45000|m2|sqft|abbr=off|adj=on|sp=us}} building in Baghdad's Al-Ṣāliḥiyyah neighborhood in the [[Karkh|Al-Karkh]] district on the east side of the [[Tigris|Tigris River]]. It is with this move that the name of the museum was changed to the National Museum of Iraq. It was originally known as the Baghdad Archaeological Museum.

==Collections==
[[File:Hrs KAP 0054.jpg|thumb|right|Exhibit during renovations in 2007]]
Due to the archaeological riches of Mesopotamia, its collections are considered to be among the most important in the world and has a fine record of scholarship and display. The British connection with the museum — and with Iraq — has resulted in exhibits always being displayed bilingually, in both [[English language|English]] and [[Arabic]].  It contains important artifacts from the over 5,000-year-long history of Mesopotamia in 28 galleries and vaults.

The collections of the National Museum of Iraq include art and artifacts from ancient [[Sumer]]ian, [[Babylonia]]n, [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] and [[Assyria]]n civilizations. The museum also has galleries devoted to collections of both pre-Islamic and Islamic Arabian art and artifacts. Of its many noteworthy collections, the Nimrud gold collection—which features gold jewelry and figures of precious stone that date to the 9th century bce—and the collection of stone carvings and cuneiform tablets from Uruk are exceptional. The Uruk treasures date to between 3500 and 3000 BCE.&lt;ref name = "Britannica"/&gt;

==Damage and losses during 2003 war==
[[File:Iraq National Museum.jpg|220px|thumb|The Iraq National Museum in Baghdad, Iraq, was looted in 2003 but has since reopened. A statue of Nabu, the 8th century BC Assyrian god of wisdom, stands before the building.]]
In the months preceding the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 Iraq war]], starting in December and January, various [[antiquities]] experts, including representatives from the [[American Council for Cultural Policy]] asked the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] and the UK government to ensure the museum's safety from both combat and looting. Although promises were not made, U.S. forces did avoid bombing the site.

On April 8, 2003 the last of the museum staff left the museum. Iraqi forces engaged U.S. forces from within the museum, as well as the nearby [[Special Republican Guard]] compound. Lt. Col. Eric Schwartz of the [[U.S. third Infantry Division]] stated that he was unable to enter the compound and secure it since they attempted to avoid returning fire at the building. Sniper positions, discarded ammunition, and 15 Iraqi Army uniforms were later discovered in the building. Iraqi forces had built a fortified wall along the western side of the compound, allowing concealed movement between the front and rear of the museum.&lt;ref name="BogdanosGazette"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bogdanos |first=Matthew |title=Pieces of the Cradle |journal=Marine Corps Gazette |issue=January 2005 |pages=60–66 |publisher=Marine Corps Association |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thefts took place between April 10 and 12, when some staff returned to the building and fended off further attempts by looters to enter the museum until U.S. forces arrived on April 16. A special team headed by Marine Col. [[Matthew Bogdanos]] initiated an investigation on April 21. His investigation indicated that despite claims to the contrary, no U.S. forces had looted the building, and that there were three separate thefts by three distinct groups over the four days. While the staff instituted a storage plan to prevent theft and damage (also used during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] and the first [[Gulf War]]), many larger [[statue]]s, [[stele]]s, and [[frieze]]s had been left in the public galleries, protected with foam and surrounded by [[sandbag]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Looting Iraq | author=Poole, Robert M. | publisher=''[[Smithsonian Magazine]]'' | date=February 2008 | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/monument-sidebar.html | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120703020429/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/monument-sidebar.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-07-03 | accessdate=February 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty pieces were stolen from these galleries, mostly the more valuable ones. Of these 13 had been recovered as of January 2005, including the three most valuable: the [[Warka Vase|Sacred Vase of Warka]] (though broken in fourteen pieces, which was the original state it was found in when first excavated), the [[Mask of Warka]], and the [[Bassetki Statue]].&lt;ref name="BogdanosGazette" /&gt;
 
According to museum officials, the looters concentrated on the heart of the exhibition: "the [[Warka Vase]], a Sumerian alabaster piece more than 5,000 years old; a bronze Uruk statue from the Akkadian period, also 5,000 years old, which weighs 660 pounds; and the headless statue of Entemena. The [[Lyres of Ur|Harp of Ur]] was torn apart by looters who removed its gold inlay."&lt;ref name=thanassis&gt;Thanassis Cambanis and Charles M. Sennott. ''Looters Pillage Babylon Leaving Iraqis, Archeologists Devastated''. The Boston Globe Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News. April 21, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Among the stolen artifacts is the bronze Bassetki Statue, a life-size statue of a young man, originally found in the village Basitke in the northern part of Iraq, an [[Akkadian Empire]] piece that goes back to 2300 B.C. and the stone statue of King Schalmanezer, from the eighth century B.C.&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;Newsweek.

Available: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7169977/site/newsweek/  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617150354/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7169977/site/newsweek/ |date=June 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the museum's aboveground storage rooms were looted; the exterior steel doors showed no signs of forced entry. Approximately 3,100 excavation site pieces (jars, vessels, pottery shards, etc.) were stolen, of which over 3,000 have been recovered. The thefts did not appear to be discriminating; for example, an entire shelf of fakes was stolen, while an adjacent shelf of much greater value was undisturbed.&lt;ref name="BogdanosGazette" /&gt;

The third occurrence of theft was in the underground storage rooms, where evidence pointed to an inside job. The thieves attempted to steal the most easily transportable objects, which had been intentionally stored in the most remote location possible. Of the four rooms, the only portion disturbed was a single corner in the furthest room, where cabinets contained 100 small boxes containing [[cylinder seal]]s, beads, and jewelry. Evidence indicated that the thieves possessed keys to the cabinets but dropped them in the dark. Instead, they stole 10,000 small objects that were lying in plastic boxes on the floor. Of them, nearly 2,500 have been recovered.&lt;ref name="BogdanosGazette" /&gt;

One of the most valuable artifacts looted was a headless stone statue of the Sumerian king [[Entemena]] of [[Lagash]].  The Entemena statue, "estimated to be 4,400 years old, is the first significant artifact returned from the United States and by far the most important piece found outside Iraq. American officials declined to discuss how they recovered the statue."&lt;ref name=barry&gt;Barry Meier and James Glanz. Looted treasure returning to Iraq national museum. ''[[The New York Times]]''.

The [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) announced the recovery of the statue of King Entemena of Lagash on July 25, 2006. The statue was returned to the Iraq government.&lt;ref name=nyt-entemena/&gt; It was recovered in the United States with the help of [[Hicham Aboutaam]], an art dealer in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref name=nyt-entemena&gt;{{cite news |last1=Meier|first1=Barry|last2=Glanz|first2=James |title=U.S. Helps Recover Statue and Gives It Back to Iraqis |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/26/world/middleeast/26antiquities.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |accessdate=March 1, 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=July 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International reaction to the looting===
The U.S. government was criticised for doing nothing to protect the museum after occupying Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,835730,00.html Robbing the Cradle of Civilization], [[Deutsche Welle]], April 18, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Irving Finkel of the [[British Museum]] said the looting was "entirely predictable and could easily have been stopped."{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} [[Martin E. Sullivan]], chairman of the U.S. President's Advisory Committee on Cultural Property, and [[U.S. State Department]] cultural advisers Gary Vikan and Richard S. Lanier resigned in protest at the failure of US forces to prevent the looting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2958009.stm US experts resign over Iraq looting], BBC News, April 18, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of the looting of Iraq's National Museum has been disputed. Based on a miscommunication by the first crews on the scene, and the empty display cases in the main galleries that in most cases had held objects which museum curators had removed before the invasion, news organizations for weeks reported that as much as 170,000 catalogued lots (501,000 pieces) had been looted, when the true figure was around 15,000 items, including 5,000 extremely valuable cylinder seals.

:On April 12, 2003, The Associated Press reported: "The famed Iraq National Museum, home of extraordinary [[Babylonia]]n, [[Sumer]]ian and [[Assyria]]n collections and rare Islamic texts, sat empty Saturday - except for shattered glass display cases and cracked pottery bowls that littered the floor."

:On April 14, National Public Radio's Robert Siegel announced on All Things Considered: "As it turned out, American troops were but a few hundred yards away as the country's heritage was stripped bare."

Reacting to the incorrect initial reports that the museum was a total loss, French President [[Jacques Chirac]] on April 16, 2003, declared the incident "a crime against humanity."{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Later in 2003, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (of London) reported:

:"Officials at the National Museum of Iraq have blamed shoddy reporting amid the "fog of war" for creating the impression that the majority of the institution's 170,000 items were looted in the aftermath of the fall of Baghdad.

:A carefully prepared storage plan, used in the Iran–Iraq War and the first Persian Gulf War, ensured that tens of thousands of pieces were saved, they said. They now believe that the number of items taken was in the low thousands, and possibly hundreds." That report was clearly itself radically understating the actual number of items looted, which is now agreed to have been around 15,000. {{clarify|date=September 2014}}

When asked why the U.S. military did not try to guard the museum in the days after the invasion succeeded, Gen. [[Richard Myers]], chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said "If you remember, when some of that looting was going on, people were being killed, people were being wounded&amp;nbsp;... It's as much as anything else a matter of priorities." Civil Affairs expert William Sumner, who was tasked with handling arts, monuments, and archives, explained that the postwar Civil Affairs planners "didn't foresee the marines as going out and assigning marine units as security&amp;nbsp;... The issue of archaeological sites was considered a targeting problem," to be dealt with by those flying bombing missions.&lt;ref&gt;Rothfield, Lawrence ''The Rape of Mespotamia'' (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2009), 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]], speaking about the museum's looting, said "stuff happens"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/08/donald-rumsfeld-book-misstatements-wmd Donald Rumsfeld book admits 'misstatements' over WMD sites], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 8 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and "to try to pass off the fact of that unfortunate activity to a deficit in the war plan strikes me as a stretch", and described the period of looting in general as "untidiness".  Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] said, "The United States understands its obligations and will be taking a leading role with respect to antiquities in general but this museum in particular."

Two weeks after the museum thefts, when major news outlets still were reporting most of the museum's artifacts were gone, Dr. [[Donny George Youkhanna]], General Director Research Studies for the Board of Antiquities in Iraq, said of the looting, "It's the crime of the century, because it affects the heritage of all mankind". After the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] set up headquarters in Baghdad's [[Palestine Hotel]], Dr. Youkhanna said he went there to plead for troops to protect the remainder of the Museum collection, but no guards were sent for another three days. Whether or not this was due to continued fighting is unclear.

===Attempts to recover lost items===
A few days later, agents of the [[FBI]] were sent to Iraq to search for stolen Museum property. [[UNESCO]] organized an emergency meeting of antiquities experts on April 17, 2003 in Paris to deal with the aftermath of the looting and its effects on the global art and antiquities market.

On April 18, 2003, the Baghdad Museum Project was formed in the United States with a proposal to assure the National Museum of Iraq every possibility of the eventual safe return of its collection, even if that is to take hundreds of years. Rather than focus only on law enforcement and the current antiquities market, the group set its mission as being to (1) establish a comprehensive online catalog of all cultural artifacts in the museum's collection, (2) create a virtual Baghdad Museum that is accessible to the general public over the Internet, (3) build a 3D collaborative workspace within the virtual Baghdad Museum for design and fundraising purposes, and (4) establish a resource center within the virtual Baghdad Museum for community cultural development.  Various ancient items believed looted from the museum have surfaced in [[Jordan]], Lebanon, the United States, [[Switzerland]], and [[Japan]], and on [[eBay]].

On May 7, 2003, U.S. officials announced that nearly 40,000 [[manuscript]]s and 700 [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s belonging to the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad were recovered by [[United States|U.S.]] Customs agents working with museum experts in Iraq. Some looters had returned items after promises of rewards and amnesty, and many items previously reported missing had actually been hidden in secret storage vaults at the museum prior to the outbreak of war. On June 7, 2003, U.S. authorities announced that world-famous treasures of [[Nimrud]] were recovered from a secret vault in the [[Iraqi Central Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-14738523.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The artifacts included necklaces, plates, gold earrings, finger and toe rings, bowls and flasks.  Officials said that of the 170,000 items initially believed missing, just 3,000 remained unaccounted for. And, of those, 47 were main exhibition artifacts. In November, 2003 Coalition officials reported a few dozen of the most important items remained missing from the museum's public galleries, along with another 10,000 other items—most of them tiny and some of them fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/07/03/iraq.museum/index.html |work=CNN |title=Iraq briefly reopens looted museum |date=July 3, 2003 |accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate figure is now estimated at around 15,000 and the tiny items include some of the most valuable artifacts on the antiquities markets.

The museum has been protected since its looting, but archaeological sites in Iraq were left almost entirely unprotected by coalition forces, and there has been massive looting, especially in the period just before the invasion (when Saddam Hussein pulled forces away from site protection) and between summer 2003 and the end of 2007. Estimates are that 400–600,000 artifacts have been plundered. Iraqi sculptor [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]] spearheaded efforts by the Iraqi artist community to recover artworks looted from the museum.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael S. |last=Schmidt |title=Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, Iraqi Sculptor, Dies at 82  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/arts/design/mohammed-ghani-hikmat-iraqi-sculptor-dies-at-82.html |work=[[New York Times]] |publisher= |date=September 28, 2011 |accessdate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 150 of Hikmat's pieces were stolen from the museum alone.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Hikmat's group has recovered approximately 100 of the museum's works, as of September 2011.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

==Recent work==
At various Iraq reconstruction conferences, the Baghdad Museum Project gave presentations to the reconstruction community advocating preservation of Iraq's cultural heritage in rebuilding projects. On August 27, 2006, Iraq's museum director Dr. [[Donny Youkhanna]] fled the country to [[Syria]], claiming "pressure to follow a radical Islamic agenda in the preservation of Iraqi antiquities made his position impossible.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5289046.stm Leading Iraq archaeologist flees], BBC News, August 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Youkhanna held the position of [[visiting professor]] in the anthropology department of [[Stony Brook State University of New York]] until his death in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grad.sunysb.edu/newsletter/George%20Youkhanna.htm Renowned Iraqi Scholar, Dr. Donny George Youkhanna, Appointed to Faculty at Stony Brook], The Graduate Review.

On June 9, 2009, the treasures of the National Museum went online for the first time as Italy inaugurated the [http://www.virtualmuseumiraq.cnr.it/ Virtual Museum of Iraq].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/collection/rubriche/english/2009/06/09/visualizza_new.html_874002742.html Italy puts Baghdad Museum online], Agenzia ANSA Società Cooperativa, June 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On November 24, 2009, Google announced that it would create a virtual copy of the museum's collections at its own expense, and make images of four millennia of archaeological treasures available online, free, by early 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/24/iraq-national-museum-online-google Iraq's national museum to showcase its treasures online with aid of Google], The Guardian, November 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/25/world/middleeast/25iraq.html Google Chief Announces Plan in Baghdad to Put Iraqi Artifacts Online], The New York Times, November 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear the extent by which Google's effort overlaps with Italy's previous initiative. Google's [[Google Street View|Street View]] service was used to image much of the museum's exhibit areas and, as of November 2011, these images are online.

==Reopening==
The museum has opened its doors on only a dozen times since September 1980 during the Iran-Iraq War. Since the invasion, it has opened only rarely, opened on July 3, 2003 for several hours for a visit by journalists and Coalition Provisional Authority head J. [[Paul Bremer]], as a signal that things were returning to normal. In December 2008, the museum was opened for a photo opportunity for Ahmad Chalabi, who returned a number of artifacts supposedly handed in to him by Iraqis. The latest opening occurred on February 23, 2009, at the behest of Iraqi prime minister Maliki, to demonstrate that things were returning to normal. Many archaeological officials protested against this opening, arguing that conditions were not yet safe enough to put the museum at risk; the museum's director was fired for airing her objections.

In a ceremony to mark the occasion, Qahtan Abbas, Iraq's tourism and antiquities minister, said that only 6,000 of the 15,000 items looted in 2003 had been returned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2009/02/2009223113058162790.html Iraq reopens looted national museum ] Aljazeera. March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In a book published in 2009, it was estimated that 600,000 archaeological pieces were looted by Kurdish and Shia militias allied with the United States since 2003&lt;ref name=ucp-rothfield&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence |title=The Rape of Mesopotamia: Behind the Looting of the Iraq Museum |date=April 2009 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-72945-9 |edition=1 |url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo5825985.html |accessdate=1 March 2015}} E-book {{ISBN|978-0-226-72943-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011 Iraqi officials announced the renovated museum will permanently reopen in November, protected by new climate control and security systems. The United States and Italian governments have both contributed to the renovation effort.&lt;ref&gt;Lawler, Andrew [http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/09/after-long-hiatus-iraq-museum-to.html ''After Long Hiatus, Iraq Museum to Open Its Doors''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001035707/http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/09/after-long-hiatus-iraq-museum-to.html |date=2011-10-01 }}. ''[[Science Magazine]]'', 26 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Official reopening ===
On February 28, 2015 the museum was officially reopened by Iraqi Prime Minister [[Haider al-Abadi]].&lt;ref name=bbc-re-open&gt;{{cite news |title=Looted Iraqi Museum in Baghdad reopens 12 years on |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31672857 |accessdate=1 March 2015 |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum also has items taken from the [[Mosul Museum]], as [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant| ISIS]] has taken it over.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Recovery==
On September 7, 2010, the Associated Press reported that 540 looted treasures were returned to Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wvgazette.com/ap/ApInternational/201009071106?page=2&amp;build=cache |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406094018/http://wvgazette.com/ap/ApInternational/201009071106?page=2&amp;build=cache |archivedate=2012-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/09/07/100218/looted-treasures-returned-to-iraq.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theworld.org/2010/09/prized-treasures-return-to-iraq/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401163435/http://www.theworld.org/2010/09/prized-treasures-return-to-iraq/ |archivedate=2011-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

638 stolen artifacts were returned to the Iraqi National Museum after they were located in the office of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11372473 | work=BBC News | title=Missing Iraqi antiquities located in PM Maliki's office | date=September 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 2012, a 6,500-year-old Sumerian gold jar, the head of a Sumerian battle axe and a stone from an Assyrian palace were among 45 relics returned to Iraq by Germany. Up to 10,000 of the National Museum pieces are still missing, said Amira Eidan, general director of the museum at the time of the recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Kami, Aseel (January 30, 2012) [https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/30/us-iraq-artefacts-idUSTRE80T12J20120130  "Sumerian gold jar, other relics returned to Iraq"] Reuters Retrieved February 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Owen''' and '''Mzee''' are a [[hippopotamus]] and an [[Aldabra giant tortoise]], respectively, that became the subject of media attention after forming an unusual bond of friendship. They live in [[Haller Park]], [[Bamburi]], Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |title=Odd couple make friends in Kenya |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4152447.stm |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2005-01-01 |accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen was separated from his herd as a juvenile following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|December 2004 tsunami]] and was brought to the Haller Park rescue center. Having no other hippos to interact with, Owen immediately attempted to bond with Mzee ([[Swahili language|Swahili]] for old man)&lt;ref&gt;http://en.bab.la/dictionary/english-swahili/elder&lt;/ref&gt;, whose large domed shell and brown color resembled an adult hippo. Mzee was reluctant about Owen at first but grew to like him and got used to Owen around him. 

The pair were featured in ''Owen and Mzee: The True Story of a Remarkable Friendship'', a 2006 book by Isabella and [[Craig Hatkoff]], as well as the 2007 sequel ''Owen and Mzee: The Language of Friendship''.

Once it was determined that Owen had grown too large to safely interact with Mzee, a separate enclosure was built for Owen and a new (female) hippo named Cleo, with whom he bonded quickly. With Owen now twice Mzee's size and well on his way to being socialized to other hippos, the famous friends went their separate ways and Mzee was returned to his regular enclosure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10576">A '''point particle''' ('''ideal particle'''&lt;ref&gt;H. C. Ohanian, J. T. Markert (2007), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''point-like particle''', often spelled '''pointlike particle''') is an [[Idealization (science philosophy)|idealization]] of [[particle]]s heavily used in [[physics]]. Its defining feature is that it lacks [[spatial dimension|spatial]] [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]]: being zero-dimensional, it does not take up space.&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Udwadia, R. E. Kalaba (2007), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; A point particle is an appropriate representation of any object whose size, shape, and structure is irrelevant in a given context. For example, from far enough away, any finite-size object will look like and behave as a point-like object.

In the theory of [[gravity]], physicists often discuss a '''{{vanchor|point mass|POINT_MASS}}''', meaning a point particle with a nonzero [[mass]] and no other properties or structure. Likewise, in [[electromagnetism]], physicists discuss a '''{{vanchor|point charge|POINT_CHARGE}}''', a point particle with a nonzero [[charge (physics)|charge]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Snieder (2001), pp. 196–198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, due to specific combinations of properties, extended objects behave as point-like even in their immediate vicinity.  For example, spherical objects interacting in [[3-dimensional space]] whose interactions are described by the [[inverse square law]] behave in such a way as if all their matter were concentrated in their [[center of mass|centers of mass]]. In [[Law of universal gravitation|Newtonian gravitation]] and classical [[electromagnetism]], for example, the respective [[Field (physics)|fields]] outside a spherical object are identical to those of a point particle of equal charge/mass located at the center of the sphere.&lt;ref&gt;I. Newton, I. B Cohen, A. Whitmann (1999), p. 956 (Proposition 75, Theorem 35).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NewtonMotteMachin1&gt;I. Newton, A. Motte, J. Machin (1729), p. 270–271.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[quantum mechanics]], the concept of a point particle is complicated by the [[Uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], because even an [[elementary particle]], with no internal structure, occupies a nonzero volume. For example, the [[atomic orbital|atomic orbit]] of an [[electron]] in the [[hydrogen atom]] occupies a volume of ~10&lt;sup&gt;−30&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. There is nevertheless a distinction between elementary particles such as [[electron]]s or [[quark]]s, which have no known internal structure, versus [[composite particle]]s such as [[proton]]s, which do have internal structure: A proton is made of three quarks. Elementary particles are sometimes called "point particles", but this is in a different sense than discussed above.

==Property concentrated at a single point==
When a point particle has an additive property, such as mass or charge, concentrated at a single point in space, this can be represented by a [[Dirac delta function]].

==Physical point mass==
[[Image:Example of a point.svg|220px|thumb|right|220px|thumb|right|An example of a point mass graphed on a [[Grid (spatial index)|grid]]. The grey mass can be simplified to a point mass (the black [[circle]]). It becomes practical to represent point mass as small [[circle]], or dot, as an actual [[Point (geometry)|point]] is invisible.]]

'''Point mass''' ('''pointlike mass''') is the concept, for example in [[classical physics]], of a physical object (typically [[matter]]) that has nonzero mass, and yet explicitly and specifically is (or is being thought of or modeled as) [[infinitesimal]] (infinitely small) in its volume or [[length|linear dimension]]s.

===Application===

A common use for point mass lies in the analysis of the [[gravitational field]]s. When analyzing the gravitational forces in a system, it becomes impossible to account for every unit of [[mass]] individually. However, a spherically symmetric body affects external objects gravitationally as if all of its mass were concentrated at its center.

==Probability point mass==
A '''point mass''' in [[probability]] and [[statistics]] does not refer to mass in the sense of physics, but rather refers to a finite nonzero probability that is concentrated at a point in the [[probability mass function|probability mass distribution]], where there is a discontinuous segment in a [[probability density function]]. To calculate such a point mass, an [[integral|integration]] is carried out over the entire range of the [[random variable]], on the probability density of the continuous part. After equating this integral to 1, the point mass can be found by further calculation.

==Point charge==
[[File:Scalar potential of a point charge.jpg|left|thumb|Scalar potential of a point charge shortly after exiting a dipole magnet, moving left to right.]]
A '''point charge''' is an idealized model of a particle which has an [[electric charge]]. A point charge is an electric charge at a [[Point (geometry)|mathematical point]] with no dimensions.

The fundamental [[equation]] of [[electrostatics]] is [[Coulomb's law]], which describes the electric force between two point charges.  The [[electric field]] associated with a classical point charge increases to infinity as the distance from the point charge decreases towards [[0 (number)|zero]] making energy (thus mass) of point charge [[Infinity|infinite]].

[[Earnshaw's theorem]] states that a collection of point charges cannot be maintained in an [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] configuration solely by the electrostatic interaction of the charges.

==In quantum mechanics==
[[Image:Proton quark structure.svg|thumb|200px|right|A proton is a combination of two [[up quark]]s and one [[down quark]], held together by [[gluon]]s.]]
{{main|Elementary particle}}
In [[quantum mechanics]], there is a distinction between an [[elementary particle]] (also called "point particle") and a [[composite particle]]. An elementary particle, such as an [[electron]], [[quark]], or [[photon]], is a particle with no internal structure. Whereas a composite particle, such as a [[proton]] or [[neutron]], has an internal structure (see figure).
However, neither elementary nor composite particles are spatially localized, because of the [[Uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]. The particle [[wavepacket]] always occupies a nonzero volume. For example, see [[atomic orbital]]: The electron is an elementary particle, but its quantum states form three-dimensional patterns.

Nevertheless, there is good reason that an elementary particle is often called a point particle. Even if an elementary particle has a delocalized wavepacket, the wavepacket can be represented as a [[quantum superposition]] of [[quantum state]]s wherein the particle is exactly localized. Moreover, the ''interactions'' of the particle can be represented as a superposition of interactions of individual states which are localized.  This is not true for a composite particle, which can never be represented as a superposition of exactly-localized quantum states. It is in this sense that physicists can discuss the intrinsic "size" of a particle: The size of its internal structure, not the size of its wavepacket. The "size" of an elementary particle, in this sense, is exactly zero.

For example, for the electron, experimental evidence shows that the size of an electron is less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29724|title=Precision pins down the electron's magnetism}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the expected value of exactly zero. (This should not be confused with the [[classical electron radius]], which, despite the name, is unrelated to the actual size of an electron.)

'''''Portfolio: An Intercontinental Quarterly''''' was a cross-disciplinary [[literary magazine|literary journal]] published between 1945 and 1947. It was edited by [[Caresse Crosby]] and published through her [[Black Sun Press]]. Only six issues were published, each totaling about 1000 copies. Each issue was a series of loose sheets contained in a [[folio (printing)|folio]], lavishly illustrated, and printed in limited numbers. Contributors included many [[avant-garde]] authors, architects, photographers, and illustrators who were prominent in their respective fields, including individuals like [[Albert Camus]] (who contributed "Letter to a German Friend," his first appearance in an English-language publication),&lt;ref name=lopez/&gt; architect [[Luigi Moretti]],&lt;ref name=mclean/&gt; artist [[Picasso|Pablo Picasso]],&lt;ref name=lopez/&gt; and photographer [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]], along with emerging writers like [[Charles Bukowski]].&lt;ref name=3dc/&gt; It introduced American readers to many authors who later became famous.&lt;ref name=mccoy/&gt;

==Origins and purpose==

[[Caresse Crosby]], a long-time [[patron of the arts]], originally published with her husband [[Harry Crosby]] through the [[Black Sun Press]] a number of emerging writers during the 1920s and 1930s in Paris. After his suicide in December 1929, she continued their work, though less actively. The press stopped active publishing when World War II intervened and Crosby left Paris for the United States.

Towards the end of World War II, [[Harry T. Moore]] encouraged her to start a new cultural magazine,&lt;ref name=mccoy&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mccoy.lib.siu.edu/show/portf.html |title=Portfolio |accessdate=2010-06-11 |publisher=Morris Library, [[Southern Illinois University]] at Carbondale |work=Library Affairs Showcase |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121210132425/http://mccoy.lib.siu.edu/show/portf.html |archivedate=2012-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which she titled ''Portfolio'' with the desire to present to the public "lively and varied examples of work by modern artists." Each issue contained prose, poetry, prints and plans. She hoped to initiate an "exchange of thought between America and Europe" and to carry forth "a new expression of man's aspirations."&lt;ref name=bookrags/&gt; She followed in the tradition of the original literary journal ''[[transition (literary journal)|transition]]'', which her husband Harry Crosby had edited. She hoped that artists of all kinds could "build a bridge of enduring fabric between the ivory tower and the arena" and contribute to rebuilding the culture of Europe.&lt;ref name=bookrags&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/mary-jacob-caresse-crosby-dlb2/ |title=Dictionary of Literary Biography on (Mary) (Jacob) Caresse Crosby |accessdate=2010-06-11 |publisher=BookRags.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529054226/http://www.bookrags.com/biography/mary-jacob-caresse-crosby-dlb2/ |archivedate=2010-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Portfolios'' included work by a variety of [[avant-garde]] writers, artists, photographers, and architects.&lt;ref name=mclean/&gt;&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.lib.siu.edu/index.php?p=collections/findingaid&amp;id=2127&amp;q=&amp;rootcontentid=50842#id50842 |title=Caresse Crosby papers, 1912-1970 – Manuscripts |accessdate=2010-06-24 |publisher=Morris Library Special Collections |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720045711/http://archives.lib.siu.edu/index.php?p=collections%2Ffindingaid&amp;id=2127&amp;q=&amp;rootcontentid=50842#id50842 |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication featured new work, translated works of foreign writers,&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/crosby/bio.htm |title=Harry Crosby: A Biographical Essay |author=Edward Brunner |work=An Online Journal and Multimedia Companion to Anthology of Modern American Poetry |accessdate=2010-06-24 |publisher=Morris Library Special Collections |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702185436/http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/crosby/bio.htm |archivedate=2010-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; re-published works of writers whose work had not been widely known, and both original images and reproductions of various artist's work.

==Publishing format==

During World War II and for some time after, paper was in short supply.&lt;ref name=mccoy/&gt; Caresse printed the magazine on a variety of different sizes, colors and types of paper stock printed by different printers, stuffed into a  {{convert|11.5|x|15|in|mm}} [[Folio (printing)|folio]], though the size varied.&lt;ref name=3dc/&gt; Caresse printed 1,000 copies of each issue, and as she had done with earlier works published by the [[Black Sun Press]], gave special treatment to 100 or so deluxe copies that featured original artwork by [[Henri Matisse]], [[Romare Bearden]], and others.&lt;ref name=3dc&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://washingtonart.com/beltway/3dceditors.html|title=Richard Peabody on 3 DC Editors|last=Peabody|first=Richard|volume=7|number=4|date=Fall 2006|accessdate=31 March 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701005000/http://washingtonart.com/beltway/3dceditors.html|archivedate=1 July 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby worked from her offices at 1620 20th Street NW  in Washington D.C.&lt;ref name=players&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stringandacan.com/Black_Sun/BLACK_SUN_PRESS.html |title=Black Sun Press |publisher=The Black Sun Players |accessdate=31 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716154734/http://www.stringandacan.com/Black_Sun/BLACK_SUN_PRESS.html |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She lived around the corner at 2008 Q St. NW.&lt;ref name=3dc/&gt; She later moved the offices to 918 F Street, N.W.&lt;ref name=pba&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbagalleries.com/search/item170066.php? |title=Portfolio V, Spring 1947 - PBA Galleries, Auctions and Appraisers |publisher=PBA Galleries, |accessdate=14 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715060416/http://www.pbagalleries.com/search/item170066.php |archivedate=15 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International publication==

Only six issues were published.&lt;ref name=lopez/&gt;&lt;ref name=3dc/&gt; Issues 1, 3, and 5 were printed in Washington, D.C. Issue 2 was printed in Paris less than seven months after the end of [[World War II]]. It featured primarily French writers and artists. The fourth issue was published in Rome and featured Italian writers and artists. The last issue, number 6, was published in Athens and focused on Greek authors and artists.&lt;ref name=3dc/&gt;

Crosby intended to publish four issues per year, and initially offered subscriptions for US$10.00 per year. Single copies were available for $3.00 each. She originally intended to print only 1,300 copies of each issue,&lt;ref name=players/&gt; but in fact printed only 1000 copies of each issue.&lt;ref name=live/&gt;

===''Portfolio I''===

The inaugural issue was published in Washington, D.C., in 1945, immediately after the [[End of World War II in Europe|end]] of [[World War II]]. It included 26 leaves in loose sheets, contained in a paper [[folio (printing)|folio]] cover. Edited by [[Caresse Crosby]]. [[Harry T. Moore]] served as assistant editor. Editorial advisers were [[Henry Miller]] for prose, [[Selden Rodman]] for poetry, and [[Samuel Rosenberg (writer)|Sam Rosenberg]] for photography.

Prose was contributed by Caresse Crosby, [[René Crevel]], Henry Miller  (''The Stuff of Life''), [[David Daiches]], [[Jerome Weidman]] (''Sam''). Poetry contributors included [[Karl Shapiro]]  who contributed three [[sonnet]]s from the ''Place of Love''; [[Kay Boyle]], [[Louis Aragon]], [[Ruth Herschberger]], [[Demetrios Capetanakis]] (''Emily Dickinson'') and [[Coleman Rosenberger]], who wrote ''Manet in the Sale Mines at Merkers'' and also served as an editorial adviser.

Drawings and illustrations were produced by [[Jean Helion]], [[Romare Bearden]], Henry T. Moore, [[Pietro Lazzari]], and [[Lilian Swann Saarinen]]. Sam Rosenberg contributed both drawings and photography. Crosby included a piece penned by her late husband Harry Crosby (''Anatomy of Flight''), a photograph by Harry, and an unattributed portrait of [[Kay Boyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcleanbooks.com/details.php?record=6315 |title=Portfolio I |location=McLean, Virginia |publisher=McLean Arts and Books |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714063506/http://www.mcleanbooks.com/details.php?record=6315 |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Portfolio VI''===

''Portfolio VI'' was published during the summer of 1947. It focused on writers and artists from Greece, where publisher [[Caresse Crosby]] had for some years tried to establish a world peace center. It was the largest ''Portfolio'' with 36 leaves of text and illustration. Writers included [[Yórgos Theotokás]], [[Nicolas Calas]], Cambas, D. Nicolareizis, and others. She published contributions from [[Nikos Hadjikyriakos-Ghikas]],&lt;ref name="hamalian"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamalian|first=Linda |title=The Cramoisy Queen: A Life of Caresse Crosby |publisher=Southern Illinois University| year=2005| isbn=0-8093-1865-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}} a sculptor, engraver, iconographer, writer and academic, and from painter and poet [[Nikos Engonopoulos]].&lt;ref name="hamalian"/&gt; Illustrations were provided by [[Yannis Moralis]], Kanellis, Kapralos, Diamantopoulos, and others.&lt;ref name=simreed&gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.simsreed.com/artists_illustrated_books/post_war.php?category=post-war&amp;stk=36692 |accessdate=2010-06-11 |title=Post War |publisher=Sims Reed Limited |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716074128/http://books.simsreed.com/artists_illustrated_books/post_war.php?category=post-war&amp;stk=36692 |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceases publication==

Crosby had already begun work on an issue focusing on Ireland and a "Negro" issue. When she did not attract more sponsors, she finally decided she could not absorb the risk of publishing further issues.&lt;ref name=hamalian/&gt;{{rp|158}} She stopped publication with Issue VI.&lt;ref name="Conover"&gt;{{cite book |last=Conover |first=Anne |title=Caresse Crosby: From Black Sun to Roccasinibalda |publisher=Capra Press |place=Santa Barbara, California |year=1989 |isbn=0-595-15928-1 |url =https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0595159281/techpros}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had intended to publish four issues per year, and never achieved that goal.

==Background and legislation==
In January 2000, following the [[History of Scottish devolution|devolution of the Scottish Parliament]] the previous year, [[Cabinet Secretary for Justice|Justice Minister]] [[Jim Wallace, Baron Wallace of Tankerness|Jim Wallace]] announced proposals to reform [[Scots family law|family law in Scotland]], which would include new legislation on [[domestic abuse]].&lt;ref name=BBCJan00 /&gt; Plans to increase protection for victims of domestic violence were temporarily delayed&lt;ref name=BBCSep00 /&gt; but the Protection from Abuse (Scotland) [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] was published in June 2001 and was subsequently passed by the parliament on 4 October.&lt;ref name=BBCOct01 /&gt; The act received Royal Assent on 6 November.&lt;ref name="statutelaw introduction" /&gt;

The act allows [[interdict]]s to be brought against abusers by their victims and gives the police the power to arrest and charge an individual who breaks such an interdict.&lt;ref name="statutelaw introduction" /&gt; By giving the police this new power, the act amends the [[Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981]].&lt;ref name="statutelaw amendment" /&gt; The 2001 act was intended to extend protection to victims of domestic abuse by unmarried and same-sex partners, as well as those no longer in a relationship with their abuser.&lt;ref name=evaluation /&gt;

'''Psychological torture''' is a type of [[torture]] that relies primarily on [[psychological]] effects, and only secondarily on any physical harm inflicted. Although not all psychological torture involves the use of physical violence, there is a continuum between psychological torture and physical torture. The two are often used in conjunction with one another, and often overlap in practice, with the fear and [[pain]] induced by physical torture often resulting in long-term psychological effects, and many forms of psychological torture involving some form of pain or coercion.

The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (commonly known as the [[United Nations Convention against Torture]]) is an [[International human rights instruments |international human rights treaty]], under the review of the [[United Nations]], that aims to prevent [[torture]] and other acts of [[cruel and unusual punishment |cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment]] around the world. The Convention requires states to take effective measures to prevent torture in any state under their [[jurisdiction]], and forbids states to transport people to any country where there is reason to believe torture could occur.&lt;ref&gt; [http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf "White Paper "The Rule of Law and Psychological Torture: Absence of a Legal Defininion, Prospects and Problem", in The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform"], edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The text of the Convention was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 10 December 1984&lt;ref name="untc"&gt;United Nations Treaty Collection: [http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-9&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]. Retrieved on 13 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and, following ratification by the 20th state party, it came into force on 26 June 1987. 26 June is now recognized as the [[International Day in Support of Victims of Torture]], in honor of the Convention. As of May 2015, the Convention has 158 state parties.

The Convention gave for the first time in history a definition of psychological torture:

{{quote|Torture is any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx|title=Convention against Torture|date=10 December 1984|work=[[United Nations Human Rights Council]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Optional Protocol to such Convention (OPCAT, 2006) is an important addition to the United Nations Convention. The Committee Against Torture (CAT) is a body of independent experts that monitors implementation of the Convention by State parties. All State parties are obliged under the Convention to submit regular reports to the CAT on how the rights are being implemented. Upon ratifying the Convention, States must submit a report within one year, after which they are obliged to report every four years. The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the State party in the form of "concluding observations". Under certain circumstances, the CAT may consider complaints or communications from individuals claiming that their rights under the Convention have been violated. The CAT usually meets in May and November each year in Geneva.

Many forms of psychological torture methods attempt to destroy the subject's normal [[self-image]] by removing them from any kind of control over their environment, creating a state of [[learned helplessness]], [[psychological regression]] and [[depersonalization]]. Other techniques include forced [[nudity]] and [[head shaving]], [[sleep deprivation]], [[hooding]] and other forms of [[sensory deprivation]].

A strictly fear-inducing method is the [[mock execution]]. Various threats operate on the same fear-inducing principle.

Another method is indirect torture, in which a victim is forced to witness the torture of another person, often a loved one. This preys on the victim's affection for and loyalty to a partner, relative, friend, comrade-in-arms etc, whose real pain induces vicarious suffering in the targeted psychological victim, who is thus loaded with guilt but spared physical harm that might affect his or her ability to comply.

While psychological torture may not leave any lasting physical damage—indeed, this is often one of the motivations for using psychological rather than physical torture—it can result in similar levels of permanent mental damage to its victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11313-psychological-torture-as-bad-as-physical-torture.html|title=Psychological torture 'as bad as physical torture'|author=Roxanne Khamsi|publisher=New Scientist|date=5 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been alleged that some psychological torture methods may have been devised by, or in conjunction with, doctors and psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindhacks.com/blog/2008/02/psychological_tortur.html|title=Psychological torture: a CIA history|publisher=Mind Hacks|date=February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] has been accused of making extensive use of psychological torture techniques at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] and other sites subsequent to the [[9/11]] attacks.&lt;ref&gt;John Hickman. 2013.

[[File:Eugène Atget (French - Chiffonier (Ragpicker) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A rag-picker in Paris, ca, 1899 - 1901.]]
A '''Rag-picker''', or '''Chiffonnier''', is term for someone who makes a living by rummaging through [[refuse]] in the streets to collect material for salvage. Scraps of cloth and paper could be turned into [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]], broken [[glass]] could be melted down and reused, and even dead cats and dogs could be [[Skinning|skinned]] to make clothes. 

The rag-pickers in 19th and early 20th Century did not [[recycle]] the materials themselves; they would simply collect whatever they could find and turn it over to a "master rag-picker" (usually a former rag-picker) who would, in turn, sell it&amp;mdash;generally by weight&amp;mdash;to wealthy investors with the means to convert the materials into something more profitable.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oHIDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA360&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Old and New Paris: Its history, its people, and its places|author=Edwards, Henry Sutherland|year=1893|pages=360–365|publisher=Cassell and Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Opinion|volume=36|chapter=The Workers in Waste Products|author=The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|year=1904|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=atYaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA782&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although it was solely a job for the lowest of the [[working classes]], rag-picking was considered an honest [[Job (role)|occupation]], more on the level of [[street sweeper]] than of a [[beggar]]. In Paris, for instance, rag-pickers were regulated by law: their operations were restricted to certain times of night, and they were required to return any unusually valuable items to the owner or to the authorities.&lt;ref name=Edwards/&gt; When [[Eugène Poubelle]] introduced the [[garbage can]] in 1884, he was criticized in the French newspapers for meddling with the rag-pickers' livelihoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynch, Hannah|year=1901|title=French life in town and country|publisher=Putnam|pages=278–279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[sanitation]] and recycling programs ultimately caused the profession to decline, though it did not disappear entirely; [[rag and bone man|rag and bone men]] were still operating in the 1970s. 

Rag-picking is still widespread in [[Third World]] countries today, such as in [[Mumbai]], [[India]], where it offers the poorest in society around the rubbish and recycling areas a chance to earn a hand-to-mouth supply of money. In 2015, the Environment Minister of India declared a national award to recognise the service rendered by rag-pickers. The award, with a cash prize of Rs. 1.5 lakh, is for three best rag pickers and three associations involved in innovation of best practices. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/rag-pickers-services-will-be-recognised-by-government-to-give-national-award/article7382780.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship in waste management and recycling ==
Ragpicking has a positive impact on urban spaces with a weak waste management infrastructure. In India, the economic activity of ragpicking is worth about ₹3200 crore. India was also found to have a near-90% recycle rate for PET bottles, which could probably be attributed to ragpicking, given a lack of solid-waste management and under-developed waste collection and recycling culture in that country. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/india-recycles-90-of-its-pet-waste-outperforms-japan-europe-and-us-study/story-yqphS1w2GdlwMYPgPtyb2L.html NCL and PET Packaging Association for Clean Environment (PACE)　2017年2月&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
*[[Charles Baudelaire]]'s ''[[Les Fleurs du Mal]]'' (1888) includes a poem where the rag-picker character has a prominent role, entitled "Le Vin de chiffonniers" ("The Rag-Picker's Wine").
*[[Francis Saltus Saltus]]' ''Shadows and Ideals'' (1890) includes a poem about rag-pickers entitled "The Old Rag-picker of Paris".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shadows and Ideals|author=Francis Saltus Saltus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YokPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1890|publisher=C. W. Moulton}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A section of tenement buildings near [[Chatham Square, Manhattan]] became known as Rag-picker's Court, as this was the profession of most of its residents. In 1879, [[William Allen Rogers]] drew the rag-strewn courtyard for ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' as part of a series of engravings focused on inner-city life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New York in the nineteenth century|author=Grafton, John|year=1977|page=62|isbn=978-0-486-23516-5|publisher=Dover Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the 1862 novel ''[[Les Misérables]]'', the character Vargouleme is a rag-picker. He considers himself fortunate because, unlike many on the streets of Paris, he has a profession.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
* "[[Original Rags]]" is an 1899 musical medley for piano, an early example of the [[Ragtime]] genre, that makes reference to rag picking, as well as a pun

In the oil and gas industry, '''reservoir modeling''' involves the construction of a [[computer model]] of a [[petroleum reservoir]], for the purposes of improving estimation of [[oil reserves|reserves]] and making decisions regarding the development of the field, predicting future production, placing additional wells, and evaluating alternative reservoir management scenarios. 

A reservoir model represents the physical space of the reservoir by an array of discrete cells, delineated by a grid which may be regular or irregular.  The array of cells is usually three-dimensional, although 1D and 2D models are sometimes used.  Values for attributes such as [[porosity]], [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] and [[water saturation]] are associated with each cell.  The value of each attribute is implicitly deemed to apply uniformly throughout the volume of the reservoir represented by the cell.

==Types of reservoir model==

Reservoir models typically fall into two categories:
* [[Geologic modelling|Geological models]] are created by [[geologist]]s and [[geophysicist]]s and aim to provide a static description of the reservoir, prior to production.
* [[Reservoir simulation]] models are created by [[reservoir engineering|reservoir engineers]] and use [[finite difference methods]] to simulate the flow of fluids within the reservoir, over its production lifetime.

Sometimes a single "shared earth model" is used for both purposes.  More commonly, a geological model is constructed at a relatively high (fine) resolution.  A coarser grid for the reservoir simulation model is constructed, with perhaps two orders of magnitude fewer cells.  Effective values of attributes for the simulation model are then derived from the geological model by an upscaling process. Alternatively, if no geological model exists, the attribute values for a simulation model may be determined by a process of sampling geological maps.

Uncertainty in the true values of the reservoir properties is sometimes investigated by constructing several different [[Realization (probability)|realizations]] of the sets of attribute values.  The behaviour of the resulting simulation models can then indicate the associated level of economic uncertainty.

The phrase "reservoir characterization" is sometimes used to refer to reservoir modeling activities up to the point when a simulation model is ready to simulate the flow of fluids.

Commercially available software is used in the construction, simulation and analysis of the reservoir models.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Tyson. ''An Introduction to Reservoir Modeling'' (2007), {{ISBN|978-1-906928-07-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seismic to simulation==
The processes required to construct reservoir models are described by the phrase ''Seismic to simulation''. The process is successful if the model accurately reflects the original [[well logging|well logs]], seismic data and production history.

Reservoir models are constructed to gain a better understanding of the subsurface that leads to informed well placement, reserves estimation and [[production planning]]. Models are based on measurements taken in the field, including well logs, [[Reflection seismology|seismic surveys]], and production history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RETINA Homepage|url=http://www.estdco.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Seismic to simulation enables the quantitative integration of all field data into an updateable reservoir model built by a team of geologists, geophysicists, and engineers. Key techniques used in the process include integrated [[Reservoir petrophysics|petrophysics]] and rock physics to determine the range of lithotypes and rock properties, [[geostatistics|geostatistical]] inversion to determine a set of plausible seismic-derived rock property models at sufficient vertical resolution and heterogeneity for flow simulation, [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] grid transfer to accurately move seismic-derived data to the geologic model, and flow simulation for model validation and ranking to determine the model that best fits all the data.

===Rock physics and petrophysics===

The first step in seismic to simulation is establishing a relationship between petrophysical key rock properties and [[Elastic modulus|elastic properties]] of the rock. This is required in order to find common ground between the well logs and seismic data.&lt;ref&gt;"Benefits of Integrating Rock Physics with Petrophysics: Five Key Reasons to Employ an Integrated, Iterative Workflow", Fugro-Jason White Paper, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Well logs are measured in depth and provide high resolution vertical data, but no insight into the inter-well space. Seismic are measured in time and provide great lateral detail but is quite limited in its vertical resolution. When correlated, well logs and seismic can be used to create a fine-scale 3D model of the subsurface.

Insight into the rock properties comes from a combination of basic geologic understanding and well-bore measurements. Based on an understanding of how the area was formed over time, geologists can predict the types of rock likely to be present and how rapidly they vary spatially. Well log and [[Core sample|core measurements]] provide samples to verify and fine-tune that understanding. 

Seismic data is used by petrophysicists to identify the tops of various lithotypes and the distribution of rock properties in the inter-well space using seismic inversion attributes such as [[acoustic impedance|impedance]]. Seismic surveys measure acoustic impedance contrasts between rock layers. As different geologic structures are encountered, the sound wave [[Reflection seismology|reflects]] and [[refraction|refracts]] as a function of the impedance contrast between the layers. Acoustic impedance varies by rock type and can therefore be correlated to rock properties using rock physics relationships between the inversion attributes and petrophysical properties such as [[porosity]], [[lithology]], [[Water content|water saturation]], and [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]].

Once well logs are properly conditioned and edited, a petrophysical rock model is generated that can be used to derive the effective elastic rock properties from fluid and mineral parameters as well as rock structure information. The model parameters are calibrated by comparison of the synthetic to the available elastic [[sonic logging|sonic]] logs. Calculations are performed following a number of rock physics [[algorithm]]s including: Xu &amp; White, Greenberg &amp; Castagna, Gassmann, Gardner, modified upper and lower Hashin-Shtrikman, and Batzle &amp; Wang. 

When the petrophysical rock model is complete, a statistical database is created to describe the rock types and their known properties such as porosity and permeability. Lithotypes are described, along with their distinct elastic properties.

===MCMC geostatistical inversion===

In the next step of seismic to simulation, seismic inversion techniques combine well and seismic data to produce multiple equally plausible 3D models of the elastic properties of the reservoir. Seismic data is transformed to elastic property log(s) at every trace. Deterministic inversion techniques are used to provide a good overall view of the porosity over the field, and serve as a quality control check. To obtain greater detail needed for complex geology, additional stochastic inversion is then employed.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, A., "Limitations of Deterministic and Advantages of Stochastic Seismic Inversion", CSEG Records, February 2005, p. 5-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geostatistical inversion procedures detect and delineate thin reservoirs otherwise poorly defined.&lt;ref&gt;Merletti, G., Torres-Verdin, C., "Accurate Detection and Spatial Delineation of Thin-Sand Sedimentary Sequences via Joint Stochastic Inversion of Well Logs and 3D Pre-Stack Seismic Amplitude Data", SPE 102444.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] (MCMC) based geostatistical inversion addresses the vertical scaling problem by creating seismic derived rock properties with vertical sampling compatible to geologic models.

All field data is incorporated into the geostatistical inversion process through the use of [[probability distribution function]]s (PDFs). Each PDF describes a particular input data in geostatistical terms using [[histogram]]s and [[variogram]]s, which identify the odds of a given value at a specific place and the overall expected scale and texture based on geologic insight.

Once constructed, the PDFs are combined using [[Bayesian inference]], resulting in a posterior PDF that conforms to everything that is known about the field.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;"Incorporating Geophysics into Geologic Models: New Approach Makes Geophysical Models Available to Engineers in a Form They Can Use", Fugro-Jason White Paper, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A weighting system is used within the algorithm, making the process more objective.

From the posterior PDF, realizations are generated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. These realizations are statistically fair and produce models of high detail, accuracy and realism. Rock properties like porosity can be cosimulated from the elastic properties determined by the geostatistical inversion. This process is iterated until a best fit model is identified.

Inversion parameters are tuned by running the inversion many times with and without well data. Without the well data, the inversions are running in blind-well mode. These blind-well mode inversions test the reliability of the constrained inversion and remove potential bias. 

This statistical approach creates multiple, equi-probable models consistent with the seismic, wells, and geology. Geostatistical inversion simultaneously inverts for impedance and discrete properties types, and other petrophysical properties such as porosity can then be jointly cosimulated. 

The output volumes are at a sample rate consistent with the reservoir model because making synthetics of finely sampled models is the same as from well logs. Inversion properties are consistent with well log properties because the histograms used to generate the output rock properties from the inversion are based on well log values for those rock properties.

Uncertainty is quantified by using random seeds to generate slightly differing realizations, particularly for areas of interest. This process improves the understanding of uncertainty and risk within the model.

===Stratigraphic grid transfer===

Following geostatistical inversion and in preparation for history matching and flow simulation, the static model is re-gridded and up-scaled. The  transfer simultaneously converts time to depth for the various properties and transfers them in 3D from the [[seismic grid]] to a [[corner-point grid]]. The relative locations of properties are preserved, ensuring data points in the seismic grid arrive in the correct stratigraphic layer in the corner point grid.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The static model built from seismic is typically orthogonal but flow simulators expect corner point grids. The corner point grid consists of cubes that are usually much coarser in the horizontal direction and each corner of the cube is arbitrarily defined to follow the major features in the grid. Converting directly from orthogonal to corner point can cause problems such as creating discontinuity in fluid flow. 

An intermediate stratigraphic grid ensures that important structures are not misrepresented in the transfer. The stratigraphic grid has the same number of cells as the orthogonal seismic grid, but the boundaries are defined by stratigraphic surfaces and the cells follow the stratigraphic organization. This is a stratigraphic representation of the seismic data using the seismic interpretation to define the layers. The stratigraphic grid model is then mapped to the corner point grid by adjusting the zones.

Using the porosity and permeability models and a saturation height function, initial saturation models are built. If volumetric calculations identify problems in the model, changes are made in the petrophysical model without causing the model to stray from the original input data. For example, sealing faults are added for greater compartmentalization.

===Model validation and ranking===

In the last step of seismic to simulation, flow simulation continues the integration process by bringing in the production history. This provides a further validation of the static model against history. A representative set of the model realizations from the geostatistical inversion are history matched against production data. If the properties in the model are realistic, simulated well bottom hole pressure behavior should match historical (measured) well bottom hole pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Castoro A., de Groot L. , Forsyth D., Maguire R., Rijkers R., Webber R., "Accurate Reservoir Modelling Through Optimized Integration of Geostatistical Inversion And Flow Simulation. A North Sea Case Study", Petex, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Production flow rates and other engineering data should also match. 

Based on the quality of the match, some models are eliminated. After the initial history match process, dynamic well parameters are adjusted as needed for each of the remaining models to improve the match. The final model represents the best match to original field measurements and production data and is then used in drilling decisions and production planning.

==Epistemology==
The word ''Self-consciousness'' in the [[Upanishad]]s means the knowledge about the existence and nature of [[Brahman]]. It means the consciousness of our own real being, the primary reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theosophy of the Upanishads 1896|publisher=Kessinger Publishing Co.|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8WknTKS-RYC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Self-consciousness+in+Upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m-PaUOLwJo-GrAew14DoDw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Self-consciousness%20in%20Upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-consciousness means Self-knowledge, the knowledge of Prajna i.e. of Prana which is Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sacred Books of the East|author=Epiphanius Wilson|publisher=Cosimo Inc.|page=169|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h0OyiQte_kUC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=Self-consciousness+in+Upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m-PaUOLwJo-GrAew14DoDw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Self-consciousness%20in%20Upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swami Parmeshwaranand  explains that Existence is not existence if it does not mean Self-consciousness, Reality is not reality if it does not express throughout its structure the mark of Self-consciousness, the Ultimate category of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Upanishads:S- Z|author= Swami Parmeshwaranand|publisher=Sarup &amp;Sons|page= 60|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Mgwzp6-HTTIC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=Self-consciousness+in+Upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m-PaUOLwJo-GrAew14DoDw&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Self-consciousness%20in%20Upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Upanishads]] the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] or [[Paramatman]] and [[Ishvara]] are unknowable; they are not merely objects of faith but the objects of mystical realisation. The Atman is unknowable in its essential nature; it is unknowable in its essential nature because it is the eternal subject who knows about everything including itself. The Atman is the knower and also the known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The constructive survey of Upanishadic philosophy|author=Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=198|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphysics==
Metaphysicians regard the Self either to be distinct from the Absolute or entirely identical with the Absolute. They have given form to three schools of thought – a) the ''Dualistic school'', b) the ''Quasi-dualistic school'' and c) the ''Monistic school'', as the result of their varying mystical experiences. [[Prakrti]] and [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], when treated as two separate and distinct aspects form the basis of the Dualism of the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Religions|author=Warren Mathews|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=73|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=l_DdHf43iwoC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=dualism+in+the+upanishads&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e2mTvHiD7M&amp;sig=3mYVHCymWz-6ojoK3VZHtk3Q40I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w-3aULSvEouzrAf8n4D4Cw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=dualism%20in%20the%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quasi-dualism is reflected in the Vaishnavite-monotheism of [[Ramanuja]] and the absolute Monism, in the teachings of [[Adi Shankara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Living in Amida’s Universal Vow|author=Alfred Bloom|publisher=World Wisdom Inc.|page=249|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KCYMqPcW4M8C&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=Quasi-dualism+in+the+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_O_aUKrTDIbtrQeIs4GIBA&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Quasi-dualism%20in%20the%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages of spiritual experiences==
Self-consciousness is the Fourth state of consciousness or ''Turiya'', the first three being ''Vaisvanara'', ''[[Taijasa]]'' and ''Prajna''. These are the four states of individual consciousness.

There are three distinct stages leading to Self-realisation. The First stage is in mystically apprehending the glory of the Self within us as though we were distinct from it. The Second stage is in identifying the “I-within” with the Self, that we are in essential nature entirely identical with the pure Self. The Third stage is in realising that the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] is [[Brahman]], that there is no difference between the Self and the Absolute. The Fourth stage is in realising "I am the Absolute" - ''[[Aham Brahman Asmi]]''. The Fifth stage is in realising that Brahman is the “All” that exists, as also that which does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The constructive survey of Upanishadic philosophy|author=Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=203|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The sublime state of self-consciousness is reached after the Seeker after Truth devoid of egoism and delusion, overcoming the flaws of attachment, firm in spirituality, free from lusts, released from dualities called pleasures and pains, the un-deluded repairs to the imperishable status, because for a knower of Brahman who has realised the Ultimate Truth, there is much profit from reservoirs when all around there is an inundation. Through Self-consciousness one gains the knowledge of Existence which is the knowledge of Sole Reality. It is not mere intellectual apprehension of Truth, it is the apprehension of the Oneness which has to be realised here in this very life. In the [[Bhagavad Gita]] XIV.20 Lord [[Krishna]] tells [[Arjuna]] that when the embodied being is able to transcend these three modes or ''gunas'' associated with the material body i.e. ''Sattva'', the mode of goodness, ''Rajas'', the mode of passion and ''Tamasa'', the mode of ignorance, he can become free from birth, death, old age and their distresses and can enjoy nectar even in this life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad-Gita As It Is|author=A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|publisher=The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust|place=Mumbai|page=621|url=http://vedabase.net/bg/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109024643/http://vedabase.net/bg/|archivedate=2013-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-consciousness is a positive experience. It is the direct realization of the immortal Brahman - ''he enters into My Being'' - [[Bhagavad Gita]] XIV.19 who is ''the ground of the imperishable Brahman, of immortality, of the eternal virtue and of unending immutable bliss'' - [[Bhagavad Gita]]XIV.27.

It is believed it takes about 42 muscles to smile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freitas-Magalhães |first=A. |last2= Castro|first2= E.=|title=Facial Expression: The Brain and The Face |pages=1–18 |location=Porto |publisher=University Fernando Pessoa Press |isbn=978-989-643-034-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the corner of the [[human eye|eyes]], an action known as a "Duchenne smile". Smiles performed without the eye contraction may be perceived as insincere.

Among [[human]]s, smiling is an expression denoting [[pleasure]], [[socializing|sociability]], [[happiness]], [[joy]] or [[amusement]]. It is distinct from a similar but usually involuntary expression of [[anxiety]] known as a [[wikt:Special:Search/grimace|grimace]]. Although cross-cultural studies have shown that smiling is a means of communication throughout the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Carroll E. |last=Izard |year=1971 |title=The Face of Emotion |location=New York |publisher=Appleton-Century-Croft |isbn=0-390-47831-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there are large differences among different cultures, with some using smiles to convey confusion or embarrassment.

== Historical background ==
[[File:Girl Portrait Kid Cute Hair Sunlight Arab Young.jpg|thumb|left|220xp|An [[Arabs|Arab]] girl smiling]]
Primatologist Signe Preuschoft traces the smile back over 30 million years of evolution to a "fear grin" stemming from monkeys and apes who often used barely clenched teeth to portray to predators that they were harmless, or to signal submission to more dominant group members. The smile may have evolved differently among species and especially among humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/why-do-we-smile-and-laugh-when-were-terrified-1441046376|title=Why do we smile and laugh when we're terrified?|last=Inglis-Arkell|first=Esther|date=7 October 2013|website=io9.com|publisher=io9.com|access-date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Biology as an academic discipline that interprets the smile, those who study [[kinesics]] and [[psychology]] such as [[Freitas-Magalhaes]] view the smile as an [[affect display]] that can communicate feelings such as love, happiness, glee, pride, contempt, and embarrassment. Also, other types of primates can express this gesture as a symbol of happiness and fun.

== Social effects ==
A smile seems to have a favorable [[Social influence|influence]] upon others and makes one likable and more approachable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gladstone |first=G. |title=When you’re smiling, does the whole world smile for you? |journal=Australasian Psychiatry |year=2002 |volume=10 |issue= |pages=144–146 |doi=10.1046/j.1440-1665.2002.00423.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the social context, smiling and [[laughter]] have different functions in the order of sequence in social situations:
* Smiling is sometimes a pre-laughing device and is a common pattern for paving the way to laughter;
* Smiling can be used as a response to laughter in the previous turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haakana |first=M. |title=Laughter and smiling:  Notes on co-occurrences |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |year=2010 |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=1499–1512 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.01.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smiling is a signaling system that evolved from a need to communicate information of many different forms. One of these is advertisement of sexual interest. Female smiles are appealing to heterosexual males, increasing physical attractiveness and enhancing [[sex appeal]]. However, recent research indicates a man's smile may or may not be most effective in attracting heterosexual women, and that facial expressions such as pride or even shame might be more effective.  The researchers ignored the role of smiles in other sexual preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jessica L. |last=Tracy |first2=Alec T. |last2=Beall |title=Happy Guys Finish Last: The Impact of Emotion Expressions on Sexual Attraction |journal=[[Emotion (journal)|Emotion]] |volume=11 |issue=6 |year=2011 |pages=1379–1387 |url=http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Happy-Guys...in-pres-Emotion.pdf |doi=10.1037/a0022902 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626032707/http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Happy-Guys...in-pres-Emotion.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As reinforcement and manipulation ===
The influence of smiling on others is not necessarily benign. It may take the form of [[positive reinforcement]], possibly for an underhand [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] and [[abusive]] purpose.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[superficial smile]].

== Cultural differences ==
[[File:Eating rice, China - collected by Berthold Laufer.jpg|thumb|In the 19th century and early 20th century, photographs didn't often depict smiling people in accordance to cultural conventions of Victorian and Edwardian culture. In contrast, the photograph ''Eating Rice, China'' reflects differing cultural attitudes of the time, depicting a smiling Chinese man. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Phil|title=Why people never smiled in old photographs|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/4/8/8365997/smile-old-photographs|website=Vox|date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While smiling is perceived as a positive emotion most of the time, there are many [[cultures]] that perceive smiling as a negative expression and consider it unwelcoming. Too much smiling can be viewed as a sign of shallowness or [[dishonesty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Charles Tidwell |url=http://www.andrews.edu/~tidwell/bsad560/NonVerbal.html |title=Non Verbal Communication |publisher=Andrews.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some parts of [[Asia]], people may smile when they are embarrassed or in emotional pain. Some people may smile at others to indicate a friendly greeting. A smile may be reserved for close friends and family members. Many people in the [[former Soviet Union]] area consider smiling at strangers in public to be unusual and even suspicious behavior. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/dept/advising/american_culture/social_skills/nonverbal_communication/reading_exercise.htm |title=Nonverbal Communication |publisher=Rpi.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dimples ==
[[File:VirgilGriffithFace.jpg|thumb|A man with cheek [[dimples]] smiling.]]
[[Dimple|Cheek dimples]] are visible indentations of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], caused by underlying flesh, which form on some people's cheeks, especially when they smile. Dimples are genetically inherited and are a dominant trait. A rarer form is the single dimple, which occurs on one side of the face only. Anatomically, dimples may be caused by variations in the structure of the facial muscle known as [[zygomaticus major muscle|zygomaticus major]]. Specifically, the presence of a double or bifid zygomaticus major muscle may explain the formation of cheek dimples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pessa |first=Joel E. |title=Double or bifid zygomaticus major muscle: Anatomy, incidence, and clinical correlation |year=1998 |journal=Clinical Anatomy |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=310–313 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2353(1998)11:5&lt;310::AID-CA3&gt;3.0.CO;2-T |pmid=9725574|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This bifid variation of the muscle originates as a single structure from the [[zygomatic bone]]. As it travels anteriorly, it then divides with a superior bundle that inserts in the typical position above the corner of the mouth. An inferior bundle inserts below the corner of the mouth.

== Duchenne smile ==
[[File:Smiling girl.jpg|thumb|A Duchenne smile engages the muscles around the mouth and eyes.]]

While conducting research on the [[physiology]] of facial expressions in the mid-19th century, French neurologist  [[Guillaume Duchenne]] identified two distinct types of smiles. A Duchenne smile involves contraction of both the [[zygomaticus major muscle|zygomatic major muscle]] (which raises the corners of the mouth) and the [[orbicularis oculi muscle]] (which raises the cheeks and forms [[wrinkle (skin)|crow's feet]] around the eyes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drewnicky|first=Alex|title=Body Language - Common Myths and How to use it effectively|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/303r1clvpjwghja/Body-Language.pdf|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Duchenne smile has been described as "smizing", as in "smiling with the eyes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Darryl|title=How to Design a Life Worth Smiling About: Developing Success in Business and in Life|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=9780071819879|page=8|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DHbhAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An exaggerated Duchenne smile is associated with lying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theweek.co.uk/93854/how-facial-software-can-identify-liars How facial software can identify liars May 25, 2018]
&lt;/ref&gt;

A non-Duchenne smile involves only the zygomatic major muscle.&lt;ref&gt;Duchenne, Guillaume (1990). ''The Mechanism of Human Facial Expression''. New York: Cambridge University Press. Translated by R. Andrew . Originally published as ''Mecanisme de la Physionomie Humaine'' in 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; "Research with adults initially indicated that joy was indexed by generic smiling, any smiling involving the raising of the lip corners by the zygomatic major [...]. More recent research suggests that smiling in which the muscle around the eye contracts, raising the cheeks high (Duchenne smiling), is uniquely associated with positive emotion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Messinger |first=D. S. |last2=Fogel |first2=A. |last3=Dickson |first3=K. |year=2001 |title=All smiles are positive, but some smiles are more positive than others |journal=[[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=642–653 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.37.5.642 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pan Am smile, also known as the "[[Botox]] smile", is the name given to a fake smile, in which only the [[zygomatic major muscle]] is voluntarily contracted to show politeness. It is named after the now defunct airline [[Pan American World Airways]], whose flight attendants would always flash every passenger the same perfunctory smile.&lt;ref name="panam"&gt;{{cite news|last=Harlow|first=John|title=The smile that says where you’re from|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article516707.ece|accessdate=18 January 2011|newspaper=The Sunday Times|date=February 20, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Botox was introduced for cosmetic use in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fischer|first=Andrea|title=FDA approves Botox Cosmetic to improve the appearance of crow’s feet lines|url=http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm367662.htm|accessdate=3 November 2013|date=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic use of Botox injections to deal with eye wrinkle can result in the paralysis of the small muscles around the eyes, preventing the appearance of a Duchenne smile.

== In animals ==

In animals, the baring of teeth is often used as a [[threat display|threat or warning display]]—known as a [[snarl]]—or a sign of [[submission]]. For [[chimpanzees]], it can also be a sign of [[fear]]. However, not all animal displays of teeth convey negative acts or emotions. For example, [[Barbary macaque]]s demonstrate an open mouth display as a sign of playfulness, which likely has similar roots and purposes as the human smile.&lt;ref name="smile"&gt;Preuschoft, Signe. "'Laughter' and 'Smile' in Barbary Macaques (''Macaca Sylvanus'')". Ethology 91.3 (1992): 220-36. {{doi|10.1111/j.1439-0310.1992.tb00864.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45743">'''Societal collapse''' is the fall of a complex human [[society]]. Such a disintegration may be relatively abrupt, as in the case of [[Classic Maya collapse|Maya civilization]], or gradual, as in the case of the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]]. 

The subject of societal collapse is of interest in such fields as [[history]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], and, more recently,  [[complex systems|complex-systems]] science.

== Causes of collapse ==
Common factors that may contribute to societal collapse are economical, environmental, social and cultural, and disruptions in one domain sometimes cascade into others.  In some cases a natural disaster (e.g. [[tsunami]], [[earthquake]], massive fire or climate change) may precipitate a collapse. Other factors such as a [[Malthusian catastrophe]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] or [[resource depletion]] might be the proximate cause of collapse.  Significant inequity may combine with lack of loyalty to established political institutions and result in an oppressed lower class rising up and seizing power from a smaller wealthy elite in a [[revolution]]. The diversity of forms that societies evolve corresponds to diversity in their failures.  [[Jared Diamond]] suggests that societies have also collapsed through deforestation, loss of soil fertility, restrictions of trade and/or rising endemic violence.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared "Collapse: Why some societies succeed and others fail"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign invasions===
The decline of the [[Roman Empire]] is one of the events traditionally marking the end of [[Classical Antiquity]] and the beginning of the European [[Middle Ages]]. Throughout the 5th century, the Empire's territories in western Europe and northwestern Africa, including Italy, fell to various invading or indigenous peoples in what is sometimes called the [[Barbarian invasions]], although the eastern half still survived with borders essentially intact for another two centuries (until the [[Muslim conquests|Arab expansion]]). This view of the collapse of the Roman Empire is challenged, however, by modern historians who see Rome as merely transforming from the Western Empire into barbarian kingdoms as the Western Emperors delegated themselves out of existence, and the East transforming into the [[Byzantine Empire]], which only fell in 1453 AD.

[[North Africa]]'s populous and flourishing civilization collapsed after exhausting its resources in internal fighting and suffering devastation from the invasion of the [[Bedouin]] tribes of [[Banu Sulaym]] and [[Banu Hilal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=461 The Great Mosque of Tlemcen], MuslimHeritage.com&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm Populations Crises and Population Cycles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527170154/http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm |date=2013-05-27 }}, Claire Russell and W.M.S. Russell&lt;/ref&gt;

In the brutal pillaging that followed [[Mongol invasions]], the invaders decimated the populations of China, Russia, the Middle East, and [[Islam in Central Asia|Islamic Central Asia]]. Later Mongol leaders, such as [[Timur]], though he himself became a Muslim, destroyed many cities, slaughtered thousands of people and did irreparable damage to the ancient irrigation systems of [[Mesopotamia]]. These invasions transformed a settled society to a [[nomad]]ic one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta's_Trip_Three.html Ibn Battuta's Trip: Part Three - Persia and Iraq (1326 - 1327)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423014420/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta%27s_Trip_Three.html |date=2008-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local [[List of epidemics|epidemics]] of extraordinary virulence. [[Smallpox]] ravaged [[Mexico]] in the 1520s, killing 150,000 in [[Tenochtitlán]] alone, including the emperor, and [[Peru]] in the 1530s, aiding the European conquerors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/smallpox_01.shtml Smallpox: Eradicating the Scourge]&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that the death of up to 95% of the [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|Native American population]] of the [[New World]] was caused by [[Old World]] diseases&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html The Story Of...

Societal collapse of many indigenous cultures has occurred as a result of European [[imperialism]] in various parts of the globe, particularly in areas where European settler communities took possession of land once held by native peoples, in Latin America and North America, and in [[Australasia]].  The effects of this dispossession are still evident in many of the problems confronting indigenous cultures, including [[alcoholism]], high rates of [[incarceration]], [[suicide]] rates and fraternal violence.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

=== Sub-replacement fertility ===

The [[Greeks|Greek]] historian [[Polybius]], writing in [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], largely blamed the decline of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic world]] on low fertility rates:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Polybius,  Histories, book 37, Depopulation of Greece|url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%253Atext%253A1999.01.0234%253Abook%253D37%253Achapter%253D9|website = www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes occurring with collapse==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
There are three main types of collapse:

'''Reversion/Simplification''': A society's [[adaptive capacity]] may be reduced by either a rapid change in population or societal complexity, destabilizing its institutions and causing massive shifts in population and other social dynamics.  In cases of collapse, civilizations tend to revert to less complex, less centralized socio-political forms using simpler technology.  These are characteristics of a [[Dark Ages in history|Dark Age]].  Examples of such societal collapse are: the [[Hittite Empire]], the [[Mycenaean civilization]], the [[Western Roman Empire]], the [[Mauryan]] and [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] Empires in India, the [[Mayas]], the [[Angkor]] in Cambodia, the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] dynasties in China and the [[Mali Empire]].

'''Incorporation/Absorption''': Alternately, a society may be gradually incorporated into a more dynamic, more complex inter-regional social structure.  This happened in [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Levant|Levantine cultures]], the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[Delhi Sultanate]]s in India, [[Song Dynasty|Song China]], the [[Aztec]] culture in Mesoamerica, the [[Inca]] culture in South America, and the modern civilizations of China, Japan, and India, as well as many modern states in the Middle East and Africa.

'''Obliteration''': Vast numbers of people in the society die, or the birth rate plunges to a level that causes a dramatic depopulation.

Other changes that may accompany a collapse:

* '''Destratification''': Complex societies stratified on the basis of class, gender, race or some other salient factor become much more homogeneous or horizontally structured. In many cases past social stratification slowly becomes irrelevant following collapse and societies become more egalitarian.
* '''Despecialization''': One of the most characteristic features of complex civilizations (and in many cases the yardstick to measure complexity) is a high level of job specialization. The most complex societies are characterized by artisans and tradespeople who specialize intensely in a given task. Indeed, the rulers of many past societies were hyper-specialized priests or priestesses who were completely supported by the work of the lower classes. During societal collapse, the social institutions supporting such specialization are removed and people tend to become more generalized in their work and daily habits.
* '''Decentralization''': As power becomes decentralized, people tend to be more self-regimented and have many more personal freedoms. In many instances of collapse, there is a slackening of social rules and etiquette. Geographically speaking, communities become more parochial or isolated. For example, following the [[Classic Maya collapse|collapse of the Maya civilization]], many Maya returned to their traditional hamlets, moving away from the large cities that had dominated the political landscape.
* '''Destructuralization''': Institutions, processes, and artifacts are all manifest in the archaeological record in abundance in large civilizations. After collapse, evidence of epiphenomena, institutions, and types of artifacts change dramatically as people are forced to adopt more self-sufficient lifestyles.
* '''Depopulation''': Societal collapse is almost always associated with a [[population decline]].  In extreme cases, the collapse in population is so severe that the society disappears entirely, such as happened with the [[History of Greenland|Greenland Vikings]], or a number of [[Polynesia]]n islands.  In less extreme cases, populations are reduced until a [[demography|demographic balance]] is re-established between human societies and the depleted [[natural environment]].  A classic example is the city of [[History of Rome|Rome]], which had a population of about 1.5 million at the peak of the [[Roman Empire]] during the reign of [[Trajan]] in the early 2nd century AD, but in the [[Early Middle Ages]] the population had declined to only around 15,000 inhabitants by the 9th century.

==Population dynamics==
In the general study of [[cultural change]] and [[population dynamics]], a whole system displays complex ecosystem changes.  Organizational [[adaptability]] relates importantly to organizational diversity.

Several key features of human societal collapse can be related to population dynamics&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.vicnet.net.au/~ozideas/poprus.htm Population crises and cycles in history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405081151/http://home.vicnet.net.au/~ozideas/poprus.htm |date=2011-04-05 }}, A review of the book ''Population Crises and Population cycles'' by Claire Russell and W M S Russell.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
The coupled breakdown of economic, cultural and social institutions with ecological relationships is perhaps the most common feature of collapse. In his book ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', [[Jared Diamond]] proposes five interconnected causes of collapse that may reinforce each other: non-sustainable exploitation of resources, climate changes, diminishing support from friendly societies, hostile neighbors, and inappropriate attitudes for change.&lt;ref name=Diamond&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', [[Penguin Books]], 2005 and 2011 ({{ISBN|9780241958681}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/jared_diamond_on_why_societies_collapse.html Jared Diamond on why societies collapse]  TED talk, Feb 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Tainter]] theorizes that collapsed societies essentially exhausted their own designs, and were unable to adapt to natural diminishing returns for what they knew as their method of survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tainter|first1=Joseph A.|authorlink=Joseph Tainter|date=1990|title=The Collapse of Complex Societies|edition=1st paperback|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-38673-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It matches closely [[Arnold J. Toynbee|Toynbee's]] idea that "they find problems they can't solve".

===Linking social and environmental dynamics===
Modern social critics commonly interpret things like sedentary social behavior as symptomatic of societal decay, and link what appears to be laziness with the depletion of important non-renewable resources. However, many primitive cultures also have high degrees of leisure, so if that is a cause in one place it may not be in another—leisure or apparent laziness is then not a sufficient cause.

What produces modern sedentary life, unlike [[nomad]]ic [[hunter-gatherer]]s, is extraordinary modern economic productivity. Tainter argues that exceptional productivity is actually more the sign of hidden weakness, both because of a society's dependence on it, and its potential to undermine its own basis for success by not being [[Self-limiting (biology)|self limiting]] as demonstrated in Western culture's ideal of perpetual growth.

As a population grows and technology makes it easier to exploit depleting resources, the environment's [[diminishing returns]] are hidden from view. Societal [[complexity]] is then potentially threatened if it develops beyond what is actually sustainable, and a disorderly reorganization were to follow. The scissors model of [[Malthusian]] collapse, where the population grows without limit and resources do not, is the idea of great opposing environmental forces cutting into each other.

For the modern world economy, for example, the growing conflict between food and fuel, depending on many of the same finite and diminishing resources, is visible in recent major [[commodity price shocks]].  It is one of the key relationships researchers, since the early studies of the [[Club of Rome]], have been most concerned with.

[[Jared Diamond]] pursues these themes in his 2005 book ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]''.&lt;ref name=Diamond/&gt;

===Population pressure and mineral resource exhaustion===
[[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], a [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field|progenitor]] in [[economics]] and the [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts|paradigm founder]] of [[ecological economics]], has argued that the [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of [[Mineral|mineral resources]] is presently [[Mining|being extracted and put to use]]; and consequently, that the [[world economy]] as a whole is heading towards an [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Population pressure, mineral resource exhaustion and the end of mankind|inevitable future collapse, leading to the demise of human civilisation itself]].&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt;

Georgescu-Roegen is basing his pessimistic prediction on the two following considerations:
* According to his ecological view of [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']], matter and energy is neither created nor destroyed in man's economy, only transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable [[natural resource]]s) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless [[waste]] and [[pollution]]). In effect, all of man's technologies and activities are only speeding up the general march against a future planetary [[Heat death of the universe|'heat death']] of degraded energy, exhausted natural resources and a deteriorated environment — a state of maximum entropy on Earth.
* According to his social theory of [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Man's economic struggle and the social evolution of mankind (bioeconomics)|'bioeconomics']], humanity's economic struggle to work and earn a livelihood is largely a continuation and extension of the biological struggle to sustain life and survive. This struggle manifests itself as a permanent social conflict that can be eliminated neither by man's decision to do so nor by the social evolution of mankind. Consequently, we are biologically unable to restrain ourselves collectively on a permanent and voluntary basis for the benefit of unknown future generations; the pressure of population on Earth's resources will nothing but increase.
Taken together, the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Britain in the second half of the 18th century has unintentionally thrust man's economy into a long, never-to-return [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot-and-collapse trajectory]] with regard to the [[Peak minerals|Earth's mineral stock]]. The [[world economy]] will continue growing until its inevitable and final collapse in the future. From that point on, Georgescu-Roegen conjectures, ever deepening scarcities will aggravate social conflict throughout the globe and ultimately spell the end of mankind itself.

Georgescu-Roegen was the paradigm founder of ecological economics and is also considered the [[Degrowth#Lasting influence of Georgescu-Roegen|main intellectual figure influencing the degrowth movement]]. Consequently, much work in these fields is devoted to discussing the existential impossibility of allocating earth's finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations. This number of generations is likely to remain unknown to us, as there is no way — or only little way — of knowing in advance if or when [[Human extinction|mankind will ultimately face extinction]]. In effect, ''any'' conceivable intertemporal allocation of the stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point.&lt;ref name=jr01/&gt;{{rp|253–256}} &lt;ref name=kb01/&gt;{{rp|165}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|168–171}} &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|150–153}} &lt;ref name=js01/&gt;{{rp|106–109}} &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|546–549}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|142–145}} &lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;

=== Theories of energy return on energy invested ===
A related economic model is proposed by Thomas Homer-Dixon&lt;ref&gt;Homer-Dixon, Thomas (2007), "The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity and the Renewal of Civilization" (Knopf, Canada)&lt;/ref&gt; and by Charles Hall&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Charles 2009 "What is the Minimum EROI that a Sustainable Society Must Have" ENERGIES [http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/2/1/25]&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to our declining productivity of energy extraction, or energy return on energy invested ([[EROEI]]).  This measures the amount of surplus energy a society gets from using energy to obtain energy.

There would be no surplus if EROEI approaches 1:1. What Hall showed is that the real cutoff is well above that, estimated to be 3:1 to sustain the essential overhead energy costs of a modern society. Part of the mental equation is that the EROEI of our generally preferred energy source, [[petroleum]], has fallen in the past century from 100:1 to the range of 10:1 with clear evidence that the natural depletion curves all are downward decay curves.  An EROEI of more than ~3, then, is what appears necessary to provide the energy for societally important tasks, such as maintaining government, legal and financial institutions, a transportation infrastructure, manufacturing, building construction and maintenance and the life styles of the rich and poor that a society depends on.

The EROEI figure also affects the number of people needed for sustainable food production. In the pre-modern world, it was often the case that 80% of the population was employed in agriculture to feed a population of 100%, with a low energy budget. In modern times, the use of cheap fossil fuels with an exceedingly high EROEI enabled 100% of the population to be fed with only 4% of the population employed in agriculture. Diminishing EROEI making fuel more expensive relative to other things may require food to be produced using less energy, and so increases the number of people employed in food production again.

===Models of societal response===
According to [[Joseph Tainter]]&lt;ref&gt;Tainter, Joseph (1990), ''The Collapse of Complex Societies'' (Cambridge University Press) pp. 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt; (1990), too many scholars offer facile explanations of societal collapse by assuming one or more of the following three models in the face of collapse:

# The '''Dinosaur''', a large-scale society in which resources are being depleted at an exponential rate and yet nothing is done to rectify the problem because the ruling elite are unwilling or unable to adapt to those resources' reduced availability:  In this type of society, rulers tend to oppose any solutions that diverge from their present course of action.  They will favor intensification and commit an increasing number of resources to their present plans, projects, and social institutions.
# The '''Runaway Train''', a society whose continuing function depends on constant growth (''cf.'' [[Frederick Jackson Turner]]'s [[Frontier Thesis]]):  This type of society, based almost exclusively on acquisition (''e.g.'', pillage or exploitation), cannot be sustained indefinitely.  The [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrian]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] Empires, for example, both fractured and collapsed when no new conquests could be achieved.
#:Tainter argues that [[capitalism]] can be seen as an example of the Runaway Train model, in that [[generally accepted accounting principles|generally accepted accounting practices]] require publicly traded companies, along with many privately held ones, to exhibit growth as measured at some fixed interval (often [[Fiscal year#United States|three months]]).  Moreover, the ethos of [[consumerism]] on the demand side and the practice of [[planned obsolescence]] on the supply side encourage the purchase of an ever-increasing number of goods and services even when resource extraction and food production are unsustainable if continued at current levels.
# The '''House of Cards''', a society that has grown to be so large and include so many complex social institutions that it is inherently unstable and prone to collapse.  This type of society has been seen with particular frequency among [[Eastern bloc]] and other [[Communism|communist]] nations, in which all social organizations are arms of the government or ruling party, such that the government must either stifle association wholesale (encouraging dissent and [[Subversive|subversion]]) or exercise less authority than it asserts (undermining its legitimacy in the public eye).
#:By contrast, as [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] [[Democracy in America|observed]], when voluntary and private associations are allowed to flourish and gain legitimacy at an institutional level, they complement and often even supplant governmental functions:  They provide a "safety valve" for dissent, assist with resource allocation, provide for social experimentation without the need for governmental coercion, and enable the public to maintain confidence in society as a whole, even during periods of governmental weakness.

====Tainter's critique====
Tainter argues that these models, though superficially useful, cannot severally or jointly account for all instances of societal collapse. Often they are seen as interconnected occurrences that reinforce each other.

[[File:AhuTongariki.JPG|thumb|[[Ahu Tongariki]] near [[Rano Raraku]], a 15-moai ahu excavated and restored in the 1990s]]

For example, the failure of [[Easter Island]]'s leaders to remedy rapid ecological deterioration cannot be understood without reference to the other models above.  The islanders, who erected large statues called ''[[moai]]'' as a form of religious reverence to their ancestors, used felled trees as rollers to transport them.  Because the islanders firmly believed that their displays of reverence would lead to increased future prosperity, they had a deeply entrenched incentive to intensify ''moai'' production.  Because Easter Island's geographic isolation made its resources hard to replenish and made the balance of its overall ecosystem very delicate ("House of Cards"), deforestation led to soil erosion and insufficient resources to build boats for fishing or tools for hunting.  Competition for dwindling resources resulted in warfare and many casualties (an additional "Runaway Train" iteration).  Together these events led to the collapse of the civilization, but no single factor above provides an adequate account.

Mainstream interpretations of the history of Easter Island also include the slave raiders who abducted a large proportion of the population and epidemics that killed most of the survivors (see [[Easter Island History#Destruction of society and population]].) Again, no single point explains the collapse; only a complex and integrated view can do so.

Tainter's position is that social complexity is a recent and comparatively anomalous occurrence requiring constant support. He asserts that collapse is best understood by grasping four axioms.  In his own words (p.&amp;nbsp;194):

# human societies are problem-solving organizations;
# sociopolitical systems require energy for their maintenance;
# increased complexity carries with it increased costs per capita; and
# investment in sociopolitical complexity as a problem-solving response reaches a point of declining marginal returns.

With these facts in mind, collapse can simply be understood as a loss of the energy needed to maintain social complexity. Collapse is thus the sudden loss of social complexity, stratification, internal and external communication and exchange, and productivity.

===Toynbee’s theory of decay===
The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[historian]] [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], in his 12-volume [[masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''[[A Study of History]]'' (1961), theorized that all [[civilization]]s pass through several distinct stages: genesis, growth, time of troubles, universal state, and disintegration. ([[Carroll Quigley]] would expand on and refine this theory in his "The Evolution of Civilizations".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/CarrollQuigley-TheEvolutionOfCivilizations-AnIntroductionTo The Evolution of Civilizations]&lt;/ref&gt;)

Toynbee argues that the breakdown of civilizations is not caused by loss of control over the environment, over the human environment, or attacks from outside. Rather, societies that develop great expertise in problem solving become incapable of solving new problems by overdeveloping their structures for solving old ones.

The fixation on the old methods of the "Creative Minority" leads it to eventually cease to be creative and degenerates into merely a "[[dominant minority]]" (that forces the majority to obey without meriting obedience), failing to recognize new ways of thinking. He argues that creative minorities deteriorate due to a worship of their "former self", by which they become prideful, and fail to adequately address the next challenge they face.

He argues that the ultimate sign a civilization has broken down is when the dominant minority forms a [[A Study of History#Universal state|Universal State]], which stifles political creativity. He states:

{{quote|First the Dominant Minority attempts to hold by force - against all right and reason - a position of inherited privilege which it has ceased to merit; and then the [[Proletariat]] repays injustice with resentment, fear with hate, and violence with violence when it executes its acts of secession.  Yet the whole movement ends in positive acts of creation - and this on the part of all the actors in the tragedy of disintegration.  The Dominant Minority creates a universal state, the Internal Proletariat a universal church, and the External Proletariat a bevy of barbarian war-bands.}}

He argues that, as civilizations decay, they form an "Internal Proletariat" and an "External Proletariat." The Internal proletariat is held in subjugation by the dominant minority inside the civilization, and grows bitter; the external proletariat exists outside the civilization in poverty and chaos, and grows envious. He argues that as civilizations decay, there is a "schism in the body social", whereby ''abandon'' and ''self-control'' together replace [[creativity]], and ''truancy'' and ''martyrdom'' together replace [[Apprenticeship|disciple]]ship by the creative minority.

He argues that in this environment, people resort to [[archaism]] (idealization of the past), [[Futures studies|futurism]] (idealization of the future), [[escapism|detachment]] (removal of oneself from the realities of a decaying world), and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] (meeting the challenges of the decaying civilization with new insight, as a Prophet).  He argues that those who transcend during a period of social decay give birth to a new Church with new and stronger spiritual insights, around which a subsequent civilization may begin to form after the old has died.

Toynbee's use of the word 'church' refers to the collective spiritual bond of a common worship, or the same unity found in some kind of [[social order]].

The great irony expressed by these and others like them is that civilizations that seem ideally designed to creatively solve problems, find themselves doing so self-destructively. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Systems science===
Researchers, as yet, have very little ability to identify internal structures of large distributed systems like human societies, which is an important scientific problem.  Genuine structural collapse seems, in many cases, the only plausible explanation supporting the idea that such structures exist.  However, until they can be concretely identified, scientific inquiry appears limited to the construction of scientific narratives,&lt;ref&gt;T.F. Allen, J.A. Tainter et al. 2001 Dragnet Ecology: The Privilege of Science in a Postmodern World. BioScience&lt;/ref&gt; using [[systems thinking]] for careful storytelling about systemic organization and change.

History includes many examples of the appearance and disappearance of human societies with no obvious explanation.  The abrupt [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in the course of a few months, without any external attack, according to [[Johan Galtung]] was due to growing structural contradictions brought on by geopolitical overreach, which could not be resolved within the existing socio-political systems.

Although a societal collapse is generally an endpoint for the administration of a culture's social and economic life, societal collapse can also be seen as simply a change of administration within the same culture.  [[Russian culture]] would seem to have outlived both the society of [[Imperial Russia]] and the society of the [[Soviet Union]], for example. Frequently the societal collapse phenomenon is also a process of decentralization of authority after a 'classic' period of centralized social order, perhaps replaced by competing centers as the central authority weakens.  Societal failure may also result in a degree of empowerment for the lower levels of a former climax society, who escape from the burden of onerous taxes and control by exploitative elites. For example, the [[Black Death|black plague]] contributed to breaking the hold of [[Europe]]an [[feudal society]] on its [[underclass]] in the 15th century.

The '''space segment''' of an artificial [[satellite]] system is one of its three operational components (the others being the [[Fixed-satellite service|user]] and [[ground segment]]s). It comprises the satellite or [[satellite constellation]] and the uplink and downlink [[satellite link]]s.

The overall design of the [[Payload (computing)|payload]], satellite, [[ground segment]], and end-to-end system is a complex task. Satellite communications payload design must be properly coupled with the capabilities and interaction with the [[spacecraft bus]] that provides power, stability and environmental support to the payload.

==Telecommunications satellites==
[[Geostationary orbit|Geostationary earth orbit]] (GEO) supports businesses in [[satellite television]] and [[Satellite radio|radio]] broadcasting, as well as [[data transmission|data]] and [[Mobile telephony|mobile communications]]. The [[medium earth orbit]] (MEO) and [[low earth orbit]] (LEO) configurations can also be used for various applications.

A [[communications satellite]] is composed of a communications payload ([[repeater]] and [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]) and supporting spacecraft bus (including [[solar array]]s and [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[attitude control|attitude]] and [[Spacecraft propulsion|orbit control]] systems, structure and [[Spacecraft thermal control|thermal control]] system), and is placed in orbit by a [[launch vehicle]]. A successful satellite operator needs the right [[Geostationary_orbit#Orbit_allocation|orbital slot]] or [[satellite constellation|constellation]], and satellites that deliver effective [[Effective radiated power|power]] and [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] to desirable regions and markets (i.e., those with growing demand for satellite services).

Satellite radio now serves nearly 5 million subscribers,{{fact|date=January 2016}} and satellite mobile telephone and data operators offer connectivity throughout the globe.{{fact|date=January 2016}} Broadband mobile terminals now provide improved access to the Internet for a range of applications, including videoconferencing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28561">Due to the convenience, affordability, and broad reach of [[social media]] platforms such as [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], [[terrorist]] groups have increasingly used social media to further their goals and spread their message. Attempts have been made by various governments and agencies to thwart the use of social media by terrorist organizations.

==Traditional media==

Many authors have proposed that media attention increases perceptions of risk of fear of terrorism and crime and relates to how much attention the person pays to the news.&lt;ref&gt;Nellis and Savage (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between terrorism and the media has long been noted.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilkinson|first=Paul|title=The media and terrorism:  a reassessment|journal=Terrorism and Political Violence|year=1997|volume=9|issue=2|pages=51–64|doi=10.1080/09546559708427402}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrorist organizations depend on the open media systems of democratic countries to further their message and goals.In order to garner publicity towards their cause, terrorist organizations resort to acts of violence and aggression that deliberately target civilians.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt; This method has proven to be effective in gathering attention:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It cannot be denied that although terrorism has proved remarkably ineffective as the major weapon for taking down governments and capturing political power, it has been a remarkably successful means of publicizing a political cause and relaying the terrorist threat to a wider audience, particularly in the open and pluralistic countries of the West. When one says 'terrorism' in a democratic society, one also says 'media'.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While a media organization may not support the goals of terrorist organizations, it is their job to report current events and issues. In the fiercely competitive media environment, when a terrorist attack occurs, media outlets scramble to cover the event. In doing so the media help to further the message of terrorist organizations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To summarise briefly on the symbiotic nature of the relationship between terrorists and the media, the recent history of terrorism in many democratic countries vividly demonstrates that terrorists do thrive on the oxygen of publicity, and it is foolish to deny this. This does not mean that the established democratic media share the values of the terrorists. It does demonstrate, however, that the free media in an open society are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and manipulation by ruthless terrorist organisations.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One notable example of the  relationship between terror groups and the media was the release of the [[Osama bin Laden tapes|Osama bin Laden audio and video recordings]].  These tapes were sent directly to mainstream Arabic television networks including [[Al-Jazeera]].

Media can often be the source of discontent for terrorist groups. [[Irene Khan|Irene Kahn]] says,&lt;blockquote&gt;New seeds of social discord and insecurity are sprouting between citizens and noncitizens. Racism and xenophobia are latent in all societies, but in some European countries they feature blatantly as some politicians exploit people's fears and prejudices for short-term electoral gains. Some aspects of the media have played into this strategy, dehumanizing and demonizing foreigners, foreign-born citizens, refugees, and asylum seekers. They are pointed out as a source of danger and become an easy target for hate speech and violence. Those who need their rights protected the most have become the ones most at risk of attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, I. (2013). A Human Rights Agenda for Global Security. In CAHILL K. (Ed.), ''History and Hope: The International Humanitarian Reader'' (pp. 112-122). Fordham University Press. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0c1d.15&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Most terrorist groups use social media as a means to bypass the traditional media and spread their propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1057610X.2016.1157402&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media surveillance==

[[Michel Foucault]]'s theory of surveillance, [[panopticism]], describes a networks of power, where all parties are transfixed by the actions of the others in the network. This model can be transposed on the network of power that media-outlet consumers and producers enter. In a network of power that includes consumers and producers, both parties have fixed gazes' on each other. The consumers transfix their gazes' on the stories that media outlets produce. And, the needs of the consumers, which is in this case their need to be updated regularly, becomes the producers gaze. The producers or media outlets are in competition with other media outlets to supply their constituents with the most up-to-date information. This network of fixed gazes' is both "privileged and imperative" for the system to satisfy the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmelzer|first=Mary|title=Panopticism in the Postmodern Pedagogy|year=1993|publisher=University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State UP}}&lt;/ref&gt; This network is especially imperative when major events in the world occur, which is usually the case with terrorism. Consumers looks to media outlets to provide news on terrorism. If consumers believe terrorism is a threat to their safety, they want to be informed of the threats against them. Media outlets fulfill their viewers' needs, and portray terrorism as a threat because of the cycle that surveillance engenders. As terrorism flourishes as a prominent discourse of fear, consumers want information faster because they feel their safe being is in peril. The idea of total surveillance, as prescribed by Foucault, becomes a cycle where the disruption of power causes scrutiny by various players in system. If the media-outlets are not constantly looking for stories that fulfill consumer needs, then they are scrutinized. In addition to the surveillance aspect of news dissemination, therein is the notion that "needs" drive the network of power: both the media outlets and consumers have needs that are fulfilled by broadcasting the news. It is this idea expressed in the uses and gratifications theory. It stipulates that the active audience and the terrorist "seek to satisfy their various needs" through media transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=B.|title=Inside Terrorism|year=2006|publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; While media outlets know the stories they show have astounding effects on the political and sociological perspective in society, the impetus on economic gains is of greater importance.

==Use of social media==
In a study by [[Gabriel Weimann]] from the [[University of Haifa]], Weimann found that nearly 90% of organized terrorism on the internet takes place via social media.&lt;ref name=CBC&gt;{{cite news|last=CBC|title=Terrorist groups recruiting through social media|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/01/10/tech-terrorist-social-media.html|accessdate=April 5, 2012|newspaper=CBC News|date=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Weimann, terror groups use social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and internet forums to spread their messages, recruit members and gather intelligence.&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt;

Terror groups take to social media because social media tools are cheap and accessible, facilitate quick, broad dissemination of messages, and allow for unfettered communication with an audience without the filter or "selectivity" of mainstream news outlets.&lt;ref name="Foreign Policy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dark|first=Calvin|title=Social Media and Social Menacing…|url=http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2011/12/20/social-media-and-social-menacing/|accessdate=April 5, 2012|newspaper=Foreign Policy Association|date=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, social media platforms allow terror groups to engage with their networks. Whereas previously terror groups would release messages via intermediaries, social media platforms allow terror groups to release messages directly to their intended audience and converse with their audience in real time:&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite news|last=Oremus|first=Will|title=Twitter of Terror|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technocracy/2011/12/al_shabaab_twitter_a_somali_militant_group_unveils_a_new_social_media_strategy_for_terrorists_.html|accessdate=April 5, 2012|newspaper=Slate Magazine|date=December 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weimann also mentions in "Theater of Terror", that terrorists use the media to promote the theatrical like nature of the premeditated terror.

&lt;blockquote&gt;HSMPress is using Twitter the way social media experts have always advised- not just broadcasting, but engaging in conversation. Spend some time following the account, and you realize that you're dealing with a real human being with real ideas—albeit boastful, hypocritical, violent ideas.&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Terror groups using social media===

[[Al-Qaeda]] has been noted as being one of the terror groups that uses social media the most extensively.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins|first=Brian|title=Is Al Qaeda's Internet Strategy Working?|url=http://homeland.house.gov/hearing/subcommittee-hearing-jihadist-use-social-media-how-prevent-terrorism-and-preserve-innovation|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Jenkins, senior advisor for the [[Rand Corporation]], commented on Al-Qaeda's dominant presence on the web:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While almost all terrorist organizations have websites, al Qaeda is the first to fully exploit the internet. This reflects al Qaeda's unique characteristics.  It regards itself as a global movement and therefore depends on a global communications network to reach its perceived constituents. It sees its mission as not simply creating terror among its foes but awakening the Muslim community. Its leaders view communications as 90 percent of the struggle. Despite the risks imposed by intense manhunts, its leaders communicate regularly with video and audio messages, which are posted on its websites and disseminated on the Internet. The number of websites devoted to the al Qaeda-inspired movement has grown from a handful to reportedly thousands, although many of these are ephemeral.&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Isis-viceo 2941899c.jpg|thumb|Islamic State Propaganda Video]]
Known terrorist group the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], also translated to [[ISIS]], uses the widespread of news over social media to their advantage when releasing threatening videos of beheadings. As of November 16, 2014, following the beheading of former [[U.S. Army Ranger]] [[Peter Kassig]], there have now been five recorded executions of Westerners taken captive in Syria.&lt;ref name="markthompson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3589350/peter-kassigs-powerful-silence-before-isis-beheaded-him/|title=Peter Kassig Bravely Said Nothing Before His Execution|author=Mark Thompson|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]], [[David Cawthorne Haines]], [[Alan Henning]], and [[Steven Sotloff]] are also among the men kidnapped and executed by ISIS. The videos of the brutal beheadings are both posted online by ISIS, where they can be viewed by anyone using their own discretion, and sent to government officials as threats. Posting the executions online allows the terrorist groups the power to manipulate and cause havoc among the population viewing them,&lt;ref&gt;http://numun.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BOP-Syria-Committee-Dossier.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the videos have the ability to instill fear within the Western world. The videos are typically high production quality and generally show the entirety of the gruesome act, with the hostage speaking a few words before they are killed on camera.

In the case of U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig, his video did not show the actual beheading act and he did not speak any final words before the execution.&lt;ref name="markthompson"/&gt; His silence and the fact that the actual execution was not included in the video raised question about his video was different than the rest.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;http://time.com/3587620/isis-us-aid-worker-peter-kassig/?xid=time_readnext&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Kassig's beheading, his family expressed their wish that news media avoid doing what the group wants by refraining from publishing or distributing the video.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt; By refusing to circulate the video of the beheading, it therefore loses the ability to manipulate Americans or further the cause of the terrorist group.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;
   
The [[Taliban]] has been active on Twitter since May 2011, and has more than 7,000 followers. Tweeting under the handle @alemarahweb, the Taliban tweets frequently, on some days nearly hourly. This account is currently suspended.&lt;ref name=taliban&gt;{{cite web|last=Twitter|title=Twitter page of the Taliban|url=https://twitter.com/alemarahweb|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
In December 2011, it was discovered that the [[Somalia]]-based terror cell [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabab]] was using a Twitter account under the name @HSMPress.&lt;ref name=shabab&gt;{{cite web|last=Twitter|title=Twitter page of Al-Shabab|url=https://twitter.com/HSMPress|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since opening on December 7, 2011, the account has amassed tens of thousands of followers and tweets frequently.&lt;ref name=shabab/&gt;

Shortly after a series of coordinated [[Christmas]] bombings in [[Kono, Nigeria|Kono]], [[Nigeria]], in 2011, the Nigerian-based terror group Boko Haram released a video statement defending their actions to YouTube.&lt;ref name="Boko Haram"&gt;{{cite web|author=BBC|title=Boko Haram: Nigerian Islamist leader defends attacks|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16510929|publisher=BBC|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AQAP and Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL/DAESH)'''

[[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] has emerged as one of the most potent users of social media. In many respects, Islamic State learned their propaganda craft from al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). However, IS quickly eclipsed its mentor, deploying a whole range of narratives, images and political proselytizing through various social media platforms.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Jeff Lewis (2015/6) Media, Culture and Human Violence, Rowman and Littlefield, Lanham, MD.&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Berger and Morgan estimated that at least 46,000 Twitter accounts were used by ISIS supporters between September and December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2015/03/isis-twitter-census-berger-morgan|title=Defining and describing the population of ISIS supporters on Twitter|last=Berger, Morgan|date=2015-03-05|website=The Brookings Institution|language=en|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as ISIS supporters regularly get suspended and then easily create new, duplicate accounts,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; counting ISIS Twitter accounts over a few months can overestimate the number of unique people represented by 20–30%.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

However, as the November 2015 attacks in Paris demonstrate, IS also uses old-fashioned methods of communication and propaganda. Lewis notes that the attacks in Paris represent the sort of 'propaganda in action' which was a method developed by the 19th century [[anarchists]] in Europe. The November 2015 IS attacks were perpetrated without prior warning, largely because the operatives met face-to-face and used other non-digital means of communication.

==Attempts to thwart the use of social media by terror groups==
Some U.S. government officials have urged social media companies to stop hosting content from terror groups.  In particular, [[Joe Lieberman]] has been especially vocal in demanding that social media companies not permit terror groups to use their tools.&lt;ref name=Liberman&gt;{{cite news|title=Joe Lieberman, Would-Be Censor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/25/opinion/25sun1.html?_r=2|accessdate=April 5, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Lieberman and the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]] issued a report titled "Violent Islamist Extremism, the Internet, and the Homegrown Terrorist Threat". The report stated that the internet is one of the "primary drivers" of the terrorist threat to the United States.&lt;ref name=Liberman/&gt;
  
In response to the news that Al-Shabab was using Twitter, U.S. officials have called for the company to shut down the account. Twitter executives have not complied with these demands and have declined to comment on the case.&lt;ref name=FP&gt;{{cite news|last=Friedman|first=Uri|title=U.S. officials may take action again al-Shabab's Twitter account|url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/12/20/us_officials_may_take_action_again_al_shababs_twitter_account|accessdate=April 5, 2012|newspaper=Foreign Policy|date=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Twitter announced changes to their censorship policy, stating that they would now be censoring tweets in certain countries when the tweets risked breaking the local laws of that country.&lt;ref name=twitter&gt;{{cite web|title=Tweets still must flow|url=http://blog.twitter.com/2012/01/tweets-still-must-flow.html|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason behind the move was stated on their website as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As we continue to grow internationally, we will enter countries that have different ideas about the contours of freedom of expression. Some differ so much from our ideas that we will not be able to exist there. Others are similar but, for historical or cultural reasons, restrict certain types of content, such as France or Germany, which ban pro-Nazi content.Until now, the only way we could take account of those countries' limits was to remove content globally. Starting today, we give ourselves the ability to reactively withhold content from users in a specific country — while keeping it available in the rest of the world. We have also built in a way to communicate transparently to users when content is withheld, and why.&lt;ref name=twitter/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The move drew criticism from many Twitter users who said the move was an affront to free speech.&lt;ref name=globe&gt;{{cite web|last=El Akkad|first=Omar|title=Why Twitter's censorship plan is better than you think|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/digital-culture/social-networking/why-twitters-censorship-plan-is-better-than-you-think/article2320773/|publisher=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the users threatened to quit tweeting if the policy was not rescinded, including Chinese artist and activist [[Ai Weiwei]].&lt;ref name=globe/&gt;

In December 2010, in response to growing demands that YouTube pull video content from terrorist groups from its servers, the company added a "promotes terrorism" option under the "violent or repulsive content" category that viewers can select to "flag" offensive content.&lt;ref name=Huffpo&gt;{{cite news|last=Kanalley|first=Craig|title=YouTube Gives Users Ability To Flag Content That Promotes Terrorism|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/13/youtube-terrorism-flag_n_796128.html|accessdate=April 5, 2012|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By limiting the terrorists access to conventional mass media and censoring news coverage of terrorist acts and their perpertrators and also minimising the terrorists allowance to manipulate mass media, the mass fear impact that is usually created will decrease.&lt;ref&gt;Weimann,1999&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Effectiveness of suspension ===
Western governments have been actively trying to surveil and censor IS social media sites. As [[Jeff Lewis (professor)|Jeff Lewis]] explains, as quickly as platform managers close down accounts, IS and its supporters continually create new IDs which they then use to resurge back with new accounts and sites for propaganda.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A case study of an al Shabaab account&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=ISIS: The state of terror.|last=Stern, Berger|first=|publisher=William Collins|year=2015|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[George Washington University]] [[white paper]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berger, Perez|first=|date=2016|title=Occasional Paper The Islamic State's Diminishing Returns on Twitter How suspensions are limiting the social networks of English-speaking ISIS supporters.|url=https://cchs.gwu.edu/sites/cchs.gwu.edu/files/downloads/Berger_Occasional%20Paper.pdf|journal=GW Program on Extremism|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that accounts that resurged did not regain the high number of followers they had had originally. However this picture is complicated as a May 2016 article in the Journal of Terrorism Research found that resurgent accounts acquire an average ([[median]]) of 43.8 followers per day, while regular jihadist accounts accrue only 8.37 followers on average per day.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Shaun|last2=Denney|first2=David|last3=Pinkerton|first3=Alasdair|last4=Jansen|first4=Vincent A.A.|last5=Bryden|first5=John|date=2016-05-17|title=Resurgent Insurgents: Quantitative Research Into Jihadists Who Get Suspended but Return on Twitter|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.15664/jtr.1213|journal=Journal of Terrorism Research|volume=7|issue=2|doi=10.15664/jtr.1213|issn=2049-7040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free speech and terrorism ===
U.S. Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, has said that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to terrorists and that they have given up their rights to free speech. He cited a Supreme Court ruling that anyone providing "material support" to a terrorist organization is guilty of a crime, even if that support only involves speaking and association. He also cited terrorist speech as being like child pornography in that it does harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ISIS getting social media megaphone (Opinion) - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/25/opinion/poe-terrorism-social-media/index.html|website = CNN|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homeland security subcommittee==
On December 6, 2011 the US Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence held a hearing entitled "Jihadist Use of Social Media - How to Prevent Terrorism and Preserve Innovation."

At the hearing, members heard testimony from [[William McCants]], an analyst for the Center for Naval Analyses, Aaron Weisburd, director of the [[Society for Internet Research]], Brian Jenkins, senior advisor for the Rand Corporation and Evan Kohlmann, senior partner from [[Flashpoint Global Partners]].&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt;
  
McCants stated that while terror groups were actively using social media platforms to further their goals, research did not support the notion that the social media strategies they adopted were proving effective:&lt;ref name=McCants&gt;{{cite web|last=McCants|first=William|title=McCants Testimony|url=https://homeland.house.gov/files/Testimony%20McCants.pdf|accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are talking about a relatively small number of people.  Because the number of people is so small, it is difficult to say why some become active supporters of al-Qaeda and others do not. What we can say is that the vast majority of people who watch and read al-Qaeda propaganda will never act violently because of it.  Put metaphorically, the material may be incendiary but nearly everyone is fireproof.  Since that is the case, it is better to spend our resources putting out the fires and issuing warnings about the dangers of fire rather than trying to fireproof everyone or remove incendiary material.&lt;ref name=McCants/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
McCants added that he did not believe that closing online user accounts would  be effective in stopping radicalization and stated that closing online accounts could even disadvantage US security and intelligence forces:&lt;ref name=McCants/&gt;  
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not put much stock in closing online user accounts that do not violate our laws.  I also do not put much stock in intervening with well-meaning outreach programs or removing propaganda.  There are too many downsides to these approaches.  They are also unnecessary.  The FBI and local law enforcement in the United States have done an excellent job in finding al-Qaeda supporters online and arresting them before they hurt anyone.  They have gotten very good at following the smoke trails and putting out fires.&lt;ref name=McCants/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McCants stressed that not enough research has been conducted on this topic and he would be willing to change his opinion on the matter if there was empirical evidence that proved that social media has a major role in radicalizing youth.&lt;ref name=McCants/&gt;

Weisburd stated that any organization that played a part in producing and distributing media for terrorist organizations were in fact supporting terrorism:&lt;ref name=Weisburd&gt;{{cite web|last=Weisburd|first=Aaron|title=How to Prevent Terrorism and Preserve Innovation|url=http://homeland.house.gov/sites/homeland.house.gov/files/Weisburd%20testimony.pdf|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would argue that a service provider who knowingly assists in the distribution of terrorist media is also culpable.  While it is in no one's interest to prosecute internet service providers, they must be made to realize that they can neither turn a blind eye to the use of their services by terrorist organizations, nor can they continue to put the onus of identifying and removing terrorist media on private citizens.&lt;ref name=Weisburd/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Weisburd argued that social media lends an air of legitimacy to content produced by terror organizations and provides terrorist organizations an opportunity to brand their content: "Branding in terrorist media is a sign of authenticity, and terrorist media is readily identifiable as such due to the presence of trademarks known to be associated with particular organizations."&lt;ref name=Weisburd/&gt; He concluded that the goal of intelligence and security forces should not be to drive all terrorist media offline, but rather to deprive terror groups from the branding power gleaned from social media.&lt;ref name=Weisburd/&gt;  
 
Jenkins stated that the risks associated with al Qaeda's online campaign do not justify an attempt to impose controls on content distributors.  Any attempted controls would be costly and would deprive the intelligence officials of a valuable source of information.&lt;ref name="Jenkinstwo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins|first=Brian|title=Is Al Qaeda's Internet Strategy Working?|url=http://homeland.house.gov/sites/homeland.house.gov/files/Testimony%20Jenkins%20.pdf|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins also stated that there was no evidence that attempts to control online content would be possible:&lt;ref name=Jenkinstwo/&gt;  
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Even China, which has devoted immense resources to controlling social media networks with far fewer concerns about freedom of speech, has been unable to block the micro blogs that flourish on the web.  Faced with the shutdown of one site, jihadist communicators merely change names and move to another, dragging authorities into a frustrating game of Whac-a-mole and depriving them of intelligence while they look for the new site.  Is this, then the best way to address the problem?"&lt;ref name=Jenkinstwo/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Kohlmann stated US government officials must do more to pressure social media groups like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter to remove content produced by terror groups:&lt;ref name=Kohlmann&gt;{{cite web|last=Kohlmann|first=Evan|title=The Antisocial Network: Countering the Use of Online Social Networking Technologies by Foreign Terrorist Organizations|url=http://homeland.house.gov/sites/homeland.house.gov/files/Testimony%20Kohlmann%5B1%5D.pdf|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Unfortunately, current U.S. law gives few incentives for companies like YouTube for volunteering information on illicit activity, or even cooperating when requested by U.S. law enforcement. If such companies are to be trusted to self-police their own professed commitments to fighting hate speech, then they must be held to a public standard which reflects the importance of that not unsubstantial responsibility.&lt;ref name=Kohlmann/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars''''', also translated as '''''The Twenty-four Paragons of Filial Piety''''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|二|十|四|孝}}|p=Èrshísì Xiào}}), is a classic text of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] [[filial piety]] written by [[Guo Jujing]] (郭居敬)&lt;ref name="Guo Jujing"&gt;(郭居敬尤溪人。性至孝，事親，左右承順，得其歡心。嘗摭虞舜而下二十四人孝行之概序而詩之，名二十四孝詩，以訓童蒙。) Wang, Qi (王圻). ''Xu Wenxian Tongkao'' (續文獻通考) vol. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1260–1368). The text was extremely influential in the medieval Far East and was used to teach Confucian moral values.

==Authorship==
The text is generally attributed to [[Guo Jujing]] (郭居敬)&lt;ref name="Guo Jujing" /&gt; but other sources suggested two other possible authors or editors: [[Guo Shouzheng]] (郭守正)&lt;ref&gt;(坊間所刻《二十四孝》，不知所始。後讀《永樂大典》，乃是郭守敬之弟守正集。) Han, Taihua (韓泰華). ''Wushi Weifu Zhai Suibi'' (無事為福齋隨筆) vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Guo Juye]] (郭居業).&lt;ref&gt;(至元朝郭居業始將伊古以來孝行卓著者集24人，名二十四孝，以昭後世。) Pan, Shoulian (潘守廉). ''Ershisi Xiaotu Shuo Bing Shi'' (二十四孝圖說並詩) preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Some of the stories in ''The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars'' were taken from other texts such as the ''Xiaozi Zhuan'' (孝子傳), ''[[Yiwen Leiju]]'', ''[[Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era]]'' and ''[[In Search of the Supernatural]]''.

There were earlier precedents of ''The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars''. A Buddhist ''[[Bianwen (transformation texts)|bianwen]]'' titled ''Ershisi Xiao Yazuowen'' (二十四孝押座文), which was among the [[Dunhuang manuscripts|manuscripts]] discovered in [[Dunhuang]]'s [[Mogao Caves]], is the oldest extant text related to ''The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars''. During the [[Southern Song dynasty]], the artist Zhao Zigu (趙子固) drew a painting, ''Ershisi Xiao Shuhua Hebi'' (二十四孝書畫合璧), about ''The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars''. During the [[Yuan dynasty]], the scholar [[Xie Yingfang]] (謝應芳) mentioned in ''Gui Chao Ji'' (龜巢集) that a certain Wang Dashan (王達善) once praised ''The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars'' and the ''[[Classic of Filial Piety]]''. During the [[Qing dynasty]], Wu Zhengxiu (吳正修) mentioned in ''Ershisi Xiao Gu Ci'' (二十四孝鼓詞) that the Twenty-four Filial Exemplars were very well known.

After the release of ''The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars'', revised editions of the text and other similar works were published. Some of these include: ''Riji Gushi Daquan Ershisi Xiao'' (日記故事大全二十四孝; ''Complete Diary Stories of the Twenty-four Filial Exemplars''), ''Nü Ershisi Xiao'' (女二十四孝; ''Female Twenty-four Filial Exemplars''), and ''Nan Nü Ershisi Xiao'' (男女二十四孝; ''Male and Female Twenty-four Filial Exemplars'').

The philologist [[Yang Bojun]] mentioned the development of ''The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars'' in ''Jingshu Qiantan'' (經書淺談). After the book was compiled by Guo Shouzheng during the Yuan dynasty, a new illustrated edition with drawings by Wang Kexiao (王克孝) was released, and this made the book even more popular. Towards the end of the Qing dynasty, [[Zhang Zhidong]] and others edited and expanded the book and released it as ''Bai Xiao Tu Shuo'' (百孝圖說; ''Illustrated Hundred Stories of Filial Piety'').&lt;ref&gt;(元代郭守正將24位古人孝道的事輯錄成書，由王克孝繪成《二十四孝圖》流傳世間；清末，張之洞等人將之擴編至《百孝圖說》。應園先生邀請為其86歲父親慶壽，陳少梅完全依照元代王克孝《二十四孝圖》內容繪製了《二十四孝圖》卷，與之相比，徐操創作的《二十四孝史》則更具個性化。) Yang, Bojun. ''Jingshu Qiantan'' (經書淺談).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation==
The concept of filial piety has played a strong role in Chinese culture since ancient times. There was also a tradition of [[Filial mourning (China)|filial mourning]], in which a person had to temporarily put aside whatever he/she was doing when his/her parent(s) died and mourn for three years. There were sayings such as "When a ruler wants a subject to die, the subject must die; when a father wants a son to die, the son must die", and "A loyal subject should be sought from a family with filial sons."&lt;ref&gt;(夫國以簡賢為務，賢以孝行為首。孔子曰：‘事親孝故忠可移於君，是以求忠臣必於孝子之門。’) Fan, Ye. ''Book of the Later Han'' vol. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in contemporary times, some stories in ''The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars'' are regarded as negative examples. These stories include the extreme example of Guo Ju deciding to kill his son so that he could free up his son's share of the family's food consumption to feed his mother. The negative examples also include stories in which the protagonist harms himself in the process of fulfilling filial piety, such as Wu Meng allowing mosquitoes to suck his blood in the hope that they would not bother his parents, and [[Wang Xiang]] lying naked on ice to thaw the ice so that he could catch fish for his mother.

There are some stories which are heavily criticised and even deemed contrary to Confucian principles. One example is the story of Cai Shun being rewarded by the [[Chimei]] rebels for his filial piety. The story paints the rebels in a positive light when they actually violated the [[Confucianism#Loyalty|Confucian virtue of loyalty to one's country]]. Another example is the story of Laolaizi behaving in a childish manner to amuse his parents. The modern writer [[Lu Xun]] said that Laolaizi's story is "an insult to the ancients, and a bad influence on future generations".&lt;ref&gt;(正如將‘肉麻當作有趣’一般，以不情為倫紀，污衊了古人，教壞了後人。老萊子即是一例，道學先生以為他白璧無瑕時，他卻已在孩子的心中死掉了。) Lu, Xun. ''Chao Hua Xi Shi'' (朝花夕拾).&lt;/ref&gt;

Min's father was furious and started beating him until his clothes tore and the reed catkins came out. It was then when Min's father realised that his son was being mistreated. He was so angry that he wanted to expel Min's stepmother from the family. However, Min pleaded with his father to spare his stepmother, saying, "If she stays, only I suffer.

When Jiang's mother said she preferred more company, the couple invited their neighbours to join them during meals. One day, due to bad weather, Jiang's wife did not return in time from her trip to the river. Jiang thought that she was being disrespectful to his mother by keeping her waiting, so he drove his wife away in anger.

One day, after he held office for less than ten days, he suddenly had a feeling that something had happened at home, so he resigned and went home. When he reached home, he learnt that his father was seriously ill for two days. The physician told him that the way to check his father's condition was to taste his faeces.

A '''torture chamber''' is a room where [[torture]] is inflicted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Torture%20chamber Torture chamber.

Wordnetweb.princeton.edu. Retrieved on 2011-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval torture chamber was windowless and often built underground, was lit by a few candles and was specifically designed to induce "horror, dread and despair" to anyone but those possessing a strong mind and "nerves of steel".&lt;ref name="Ryley Scott"/&gt;

Historically, torture chambers were located in royal palaces, in castles of the nobility and even buildings belonging to the church. They featured secret trap-doors which could be activated to throw victims into dark [[dungeon]]s where they remained and eventually died. The skeletal remains of people who disappeared were strewn on the floor of the hidden dungeons. Other times the dungeons under the trap-doors included pits of water where the victim was thrown to drown after a lengthy torture session in the chamber above.&lt;ref name="Alger1889"/&gt;

In Peru, the torture chambers of the [[Inquisition]] were specifically constructed with thick walls so that the screams of the victims could not penetrate them and no sound could be heard from the outside. Other more sophisticated designs used principles of [[acoustics]] to muffle the screams of the tortured and included walls which recessed and protruded  in such a fashion as to reflect the screams of the victims so that the sounds would not be carried to the exterior.

The mere presence of the torture chamber was used as a form of intimidation and coercion. The victims were first shown the chamber and if they confessed they would not be tortured inside it. Other times the torture chamber was used as the final destination in a series of prison cells where the victims would gradually be moved from one type of cell to another, under progressively worsening conditions of incarceration, and if they did not recant in the earlier stages they would finally reach the torture chamber. The final stage of actually going to the torture chamber itself, just prior to the initiation of torture, was euphemistically called the "Question".&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt;

[[File:Tower of London, Traitors Gate.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Tower of London and Traitors Gate. In the [[Middle ages]], torture was carried out in its chambers]]
Throughout history torture chambers have been used in a multiplicity of ways starting from [[Torture#Torture in the past|Roman]] times. Torture chamber use during the Middle Ages was frequent. Religious, social and political persecution led to the widespread use of torture during that time. Torture chambers were also used during the [[Spanish Inquisition]] and at the [[Tower of London]].&lt;ref name="Spanish"&gt;[http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/mass/torquemada/index.html Torquemada and the Spanish Inquisition:Chapter 3.

Another example of a torture chamber, not known by many, is "The Thieves Tower" in the [[Alsace, France|Alsace]] region of France. Once a tower used for torture, it is now a small museum displaying instruments used upon the prisoners to get them to confess crimes.&lt;ref name="alsace-route-des-vins.com"&gt;[http://www.oconus.com/Main/eArticle.asp?205 Overseas Military Portal website.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104181353/http://www.oconus.com/Main/eArticle.asp?205 |date=4 November 2006 }} quote:''The Thieves Tower wasn’t a hideout for medieval criminals, but a place where they would pay for their crimes.

In [[Venice]], the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Palazzo Ducale]] had its own torture chamber, which was deemed to be of such importance that renovations started in 1507 so that the chamber walls could be kept strong and secure: "''considerata la grandissima importantia de j cameroti di la Camera del tormento che siano forti e securi''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard John Goy|title=Building Renaissance Venice: patrons, architects and builders, c. 1430–1500|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SCUkqUZOTc8C&amp;pg=PA231|accessdate=30 August 2011|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-11292-4|pages=231–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ashoka's Hell===
{{main article|Ashoka's Hell}}
According to the narrations of [[Ashokavadana]], King [[Ashoka]], prior to his conversion to Buddhism, was a fierce and sadistic ruler, known as ''Ashoka the Fierce'', who built a palatial torture chamber known as ''Ashoka's Hell''. The legend of the torture palace is detailed in the writings of the Ashokavadana.

According to Ashokavadana, Ashoka asked Girika, who was the official executioner of his kingdom, to design an elaborate torture chamber disguised as a beautiful and "enticing" palace adorned with all kinds of decorations and full of amenities such as exclusive baths decorated with flowers,  fruit trees and many ornaments. It was artfully designed to make people long to just look at it.&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;

According to legend, beneath the veneer of beauty deep inside the  exclusive mansion, torture chambers were constructed  which were full of the most sadistic and cruel instruments of torture including furnaces producing molten metal.&lt;ref name="SaranMishi2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mishi Saran|author2=Mishi|title=Chasing the Monk's Shadow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hkOBNbnOGYC&amp;pg=PA274|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 July 2012|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-306439-8|page=274|quote=By Xuanzang's account, King Ashoka was at first a horrid man. He had custom-built torture chambers that he enclosed in high walls. There were furnaces of molten metal, ugly sharp instruments. Every criminal in the land was consigned to this compound, all who crossed its threshold had to die.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the accounts contained in the Ashokavadana, Girika, the architect of the chamber, was inspired by descriptions of the five tortures of the [[Buddhist hell]] for the design of the torture chamber and of the torture methods he inflicted upon his victims.&lt;ref name="Scharfstein1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben-Ami Scharfstein|title=Amoral Politics: The Persistent Truth of Machiavellism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ibkxwtmP7_UC&amp;pg=PA61|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=1995|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-1886-5|pages=61–62|quote=The executioner persuades Ashoka to build a prison in which the tortures imitate those suffered in Buddhist hell [...] In response the executioner wants to kill Ashoka-on the grounds that the king has promised that no one who has entered the prison will leave it alive-...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gananath Obeyesekere|title=Imagining Karma: Ethical Transformation in Amerindian, Buddhist, and Greek Rebirth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yllblMkRgMMC&amp;pg=PA172|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23243-3|pages=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; The torture chamber was so terrifying, that King Ashoka himself was thought to have visited [[hell]] so that he could perfect its evil design.&lt;ref name="Vittachi2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nury Vittachi|title=The Kama Sutra of Business: Management Principles from Indian Classics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xK5CBu0UBygC&amp;pg=PT162|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=13 April 2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-82223-4|page=162|quote=He apparently built a torture chamber that was so horrible that people said he had descended to Hell itself to pick up design ideas.

Ashoka made Girika promise that he would never allow anyone who entered the palace to exit alive, including Ashoka himself.&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt; In the ''Biographical Sutra of King Ashoka'' the palace is described by the sentence: 'King Ashoka constructed a hell'.&lt;ref name="Brazier2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Brazier|title=The New Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v-zNSbmOjVIC&amp;pg=PA59|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 June 2002|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-29518-9|page=59|quote=There is, for instance, the account in the Biographical Sutra of King Ashoka of how the king, like any good tyrant, had a secret police force and this was backed up by a singularly sinister torture chamber.

==== Methods of coercion ====

The process of being tied and led to the torture rack inside the torture chamber was a form of intimidation and was called ''territio realis'' as opposed to ''territio verbalis oder lexis'' which was the verbal threat of torture being made at the judgment hall. ''Territio realis'' as well as the actual torture session were called ''examen rigorosum''.&lt;ref name=Review&gt;{{cite book|title=The Contemporary Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AosFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA688|year=1880|publisher=A. Strahan ''[[The Contemporary Review]]''|pages=688–690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Crime and criminal justice in Europe and Canada'' it is mentioned that fear was a factor in the process of torture and that there was a form of torture known as ''La présentation de la question'' or simply the "Question",&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt; where the prisoner was led to the torture chamber and was shown the implements of torture. While at the chamber, sentence to full torture was pronounced but, immediately after, the prisoner was taken back to the prison cell, without actually having been tortured.&lt;ref name="Criminal Justice"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Hamilton Baker|author2=Louis A.

Press|isbn=978-0-88920-118-7|pages=59–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The torture chamber was specifically designed to evoke fear in the victims.&lt;ref name="History of Torture Throughout the Ages"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Ryley Scott|title=History of Torture Throughout the Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tj7vbMmuvhYC&amp;pg=PA66|accessdate=30 August 2011|date=10 March 2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-4063-9|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was usually built underground and only dimly lit. Inside the chamber waited the executioner, his face completely covered apart from two holes in the garment to enable him to peer through and wearing a black hood; his menacing appearance being described as "most diabolical" and "satanic".&lt;ref name="History of Torture Throughout the Ages"/&gt;

When during the Question, the view of the chamber, the torture implements and the executioner did not cause the victim to confess, a full-scale torture session was planned. To prepare for torture, the victim was stripped naked with hands tied. The penultimate step to torture included a repetition of the questions asked earlier of the victims. If the victims still proclaimed their innocence, full torture was initiated.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History of Torture Throughout the Ages"/&gt;

The most common instrument of torture was the ''[[strappado]]'',&lt;ref name="Inquisition from Its Establishment"/&gt; which was a simple rope and [[pulley]] system. With the pulley attached to ceiling of the chamber, the lifting rope was tied to the wrist of the victim, whose hands were tied behind their back. Subsequently, the victim was raised to the ceiling and then lowered using a jerking motion causing dislocation of the [[shoulder joint]]s. To increase the suffering caused by the strappado, weights were attached to the feet of the victim.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Inquisition from Its Establishment"/&gt;

Church doctrine protected human life so it was problematic if a victim were to die, especially before they confessed. In difficult cases, when a victim would not readily confess or was too weak to continue in an uninterrupted torture session, breaks were allowed between torture sessions because Inquisition regulations only allowed one torture session per victim. That way, a torture session could resume after a break to allow time for the victim to recover or reconsider their opposition to confessing, and it was considered to have been the continuation of the previous torture session and not a new one.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt;

Because confession under torture was not acceptable, the victim had to sign a written confession after they had made their oral confession under torture. Typically, during confession, the inquisitors demanded that the prisoner  implicate as many people as possible and not only themselves. If the prisoner resisted signing, the inquisitors could always resume the torture by claiming that they had just halted the session, just for the signing, but did not really put an end to it.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt;

The torture chamber was the final destination in a progression of four cell types during incarceration at the Palace of the Inquisition. The palace contained the Judgement Hall, the offices of the employees, the private apartments of the [[Grand Inquisitor]] and the detention cells adjacent to the apartments.&lt;ref name="Heckethorn2005"/&gt; The detention cell gradations started with the ''cells of mercy'' reserved mainly for rich transgressors who upon bequeathing all their property to the Inquisition were normally let go after a time of detention in the cells.

For more difficult prisoners the next cell stage was the ''cell of penitence''. These were situated in small round towers of about 3 metres (ten feet) in diameter. They were painted white and included rudimentary furniture such as a stool and a bed. Very little light was allowed in. If the prisoner did not cooperate, the next step in the detention process was the [[dungeon]]. The dungeon had walls 1.5 metres (five feet) thick, double doors and was in complete darkness. No conversation of any type was allowed in the dungeon.&lt;ref name="P and R"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heckethorn2005"/&gt; The food allowance for prisoners was less than a penny a day including the profit of the warden while any human refuse was removed every four days.  After a stay in the dungeon, uncooperative prisoners were moved to their final destination: the torture chamber.&lt;ref name="Heckethorn2005"/&gt;

====Film====
In film the torture chamber is also known as the '''chamber of horrors''', with the word ''horror'' implying ''torture'' as well as ''[[murder]]'', or a combination of both. Classic films focusing on the torture chamber include:
*''[[The Pit and the Pendulum (1961 film)|The Pit and the Pendulum]]'' (1961).
*''[[Chamber of Horrors (1966 film)|Chamber of Horrors]]'' (1966).

*There is a torture chamber In [[George Orwell]]'s famous novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949), [[Room 101]].
*In [[Gaston Leroux]]'s novel ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (serialised in ''[[Le Gaulois]]'' from September 23, 1909, to January 8, 1910), [[Erik_(The_Phantom_of_the_Opera)|Erik]] (the Phantom's) chamber of torture consisted of a hexagonal room lined with [[mirror]]s on each wall.  Temperatures vary inside the room, and soon, without food or water, people trapped in there begin having [[hallucination]]s.  There is an iron tree in there with a [[lasso]] under it with which one can commit [[suicide]], which is the only way out.
*Harold T. Wilkins' article in the September 1929 issue of ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', titled "Secrets of Ancient Torture Chambers", describes the [fictitious] shrinking torture chamber at the Tolfi castle in [[Sicily]]  as an example of an ancient torture chamber and proposes a mechanical model to account for the contracting action of the chamber.&lt;ref name="Shrinking chamber"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Popular Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xt4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA402|accessdate=30 August 2011|date=September 1929|publisher=Hearst Magazines|pages=402–404|issn=0032-4558}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[William Mudford]]'s most famous tale{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} is the short story "[[The Iron Shroud]]", a classic predicament story, describes the plight of a noble Italian hero who is confined in a continuously and imperceptibly contracting iron torture chamber at Tolfi castle. The chamber walls and ceiling are slowly contracting, day by day, through mechanical means, to the point of eventually crushing and enveloping the victim, thus metaphorically becoming his iron shroud. 
*Mulford's story provided Edgar Allan Poe with the idea of the shrinking cell in his short story "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]" (1842).

====Opera====
*In ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'' the torture chamber is introduced with its own music while there is a dramatic scene where Judith and Bluebeard make reference to the torture chamber and the red light of its interior that escapes through its open door. The torture chamber musical introduction possesses a circular form with the introduction repeating, in a shorter form, at the conclusion of the torture chamber scene. This is in contrast to the rest of the musical composition of the opera which is ''[[through-composed]]''.&lt;ref name="Carolina1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greensboro Carl S.

The Buddhist doctrine of '''the two truths''' ({{bo|w=bden pa gnyis}}) differentiates between two levels of ''[[satya]]'' (Sanskrit), meaning [[truth]] or "really existing" in the discourse of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]: the "conventional" or "provisional" ({{IAST|''saṁvṛti''}}) truth, and the "ultimate" ({{IAST|''paramārtha''}}) truth.{{sfn|Matilal|2002|pp=203-208}}

The exact meaning varies between the various Buddhist schools and traditions. The best known interpretation is from the [[Madhyamaka]] school of [[IAST|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism, whose founder was [[Nagarjuna]].{{sfn|Matilal|2002|pp=203-208}} For Nagarjuna, the two truths are ''epistemological truths''. The phenomenal world is accorded a provisional existence. The character of the phenomenal world is declared to be neither real nor unreal, but logically indeterminable. Ultimately, phenomena are empty (''sunyata'') of an inherent self or essence, but exist [[Pratītyasamutpāda|depending on other phenomena]] (''Pratītyasamutpāda'').{{sfn|Matilal|2002|pp=203-208}}

In Chinese Buddhism, the [[Madhyamaka]] position is accepted and the two truths refer to two ''ontological truths''. Reality exists of two levels, a relative level and an absolute level.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=11}} Based on their understanding of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, the Chinese supposed that the teaching of the Buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths.{{sfn|Lai|2003}}

The {{IAST|''śūnyatā''}} doctrine is an attempt to show that it is neither proper nor strictly justifiable to regard any metaphysical system as absolutely valid. It doesn't lead to nihilism but strikes a middle course between excessive naivete and excessive scepticism.{{sfn|Matilal|2002|pp=203-208}}

==Etymology and meaning==
''[[Satya]]'' is usually taken to mean "truth", but does also refer to mean "a reality," "a genuinely real existent."{{sfn|Harvey|2012|p=50}} "Satya" (Sat-yá)&lt;ref name=aam/&gt; is derived from [[Sat (Sanskrit)|''Sat'']] and ''ya''. ''Sat'' means being, reality, and is the [[present participle]] of the root ''as'' "to be" ([[PIE]] ''{{PIE|[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h₁es-|*h₁es-]]}}''; cognate to English ''[[:wikt:is|is]]'').&lt;ref name=aam&gt;[[Arthur Anthony Macdonell|A. A. Macdonell]], Sanskrit English Dictionary, Asian Educational Services, {{ISBN|978-8120617797}}, page 330-331&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ya'' and ''yam'' means "advancing, supporting, hold up, sustain, one that moves".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=yA&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 yA] Sanskrit English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html ''yam''] Monier Williams' Sanskrit English Dictionary, Univ of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; As a composite word, ''Satya'' and ''Satyam'' imply that "which supports, sustains and advances reality, being"; it literally means, "that which is true, actual, real, genuine, trustworthy, valid".&lt;ref name=aam/&gt;

The two truths doctrine states that there is:
* ''Provisional ''or conventional truth ([[Sanskrit]] {{IAST|''saṁvṛti''}}''-satya'', [[Pāli]] ''sammuti sacca'', [[Tibetan alphabet|Tibetan]] ''kun-rdzob bden-pa''), which describes our daily experience of a concrete world, and
* ''Ultimate'' truth (Sanskrit, ''paramārtha-satya'', Pāli ''paramattha sacca'', Tibetan: ''don-dam bden-pa''), which describes the ultimate reality as ''[[sunyata]]'', empty of concrete and inherent characteristics.

[[Chandrakirti|Chandrakīrti]] suggests three possible meanings of {{IAST|''saṁvṛti''}} :{{sfn|Matilal|2002|pp=203-208}}
# complete covering or the 'screen' of ignorance which hides truth
# existence or origination through dependence, mutual conditioning
# worldly behavior or speech behavior involving designation and designatum, cognition and cognitum.

The conventional truth may be interpreted as "obscurative truth" or "that which obscures the true nature" as a result. It is constituted by the appearances of mistaken awareness. Conventional truth would be the appearance that includes a duality of apprehender and apprehended, and objects perceived within that. Ultimate truths, are phenomena free from the duality of apprehender and apprehended.&lt;ref name="LevinsonAug06"&gt;Levinson, Jules (August 2006) ''[http://www.berotsana.org/pdf/lotsawa_timesII_sc.pdf Lotsawa Times Volume II] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724083326/http://www.berotsana.org/pdf/lotsawa_timesII_sc.pdf |date=July 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Buddha's teaching of ({{IAST|''dharma''}}) may be viewed as a path ({{IAST|''mārga''}}) of release from the anxieties of life. The first Noble Truth equates life-experiences with pain and suffering. Buddha's language was simple and colloquial. Naturally, various statements of Buddha at times appear contradictory to each other. Later Buddhist teachers were faced with the problem of resolving these contradictions. Nagarjuna and other teachers introduced an exegetical technique level-distinction between two levels of truth, the conventional and the ultimate.{{sfn|Matilal|2002|pp=203-208}}

A similar method is reflected in the Brahmanical exegesis of the Vedic scriptuires which combine the ritualistic injunctions of the [[Brahmanas|Brahmana]] and speculative philosophical questions of the [[Upanishads]] as one whole 'revealed' body of work thereby contrasting the {{IAST|''jñāna kāņḍa''}} with {{IAST|''karmakāņḍa''}}.{{sfn|Matilal|2002|pp=203-208}}

==Origin and development==
While the concept of the two truths is associated with the [[Madhyamaka]] school, its history goes back to the oldest Buddhism.

===Early Indian Buddhism===

====Pali Canon====
In the Pali canon, the distinction is not made between a lower ''truth'' and a higher ''truth'', but rather between two kinds of expressions of the same truth, which must be interpreted differently. Thus a phrase or passage, or a whole sutta, might be classed as ''neyyattha'' or ''samuti'' or ''vohāra'', but it is not regarded at this stage as expressing or conveying a different level of ''truth''.

''Nītattha'' (Pāli; Sanskrit: ''nītārtha''), "of plain or clear meaning"&lt;ref name="Monier-Williams"&gt;Monier-Williams&lt;/ref&gt; and ''neyyattha'' (Pāli; Sanskrit: ''neyartha''), "[a word or sentence] having a sense that can only be guessed".&lt;ref name="Monier-Williams"/&gt; These terms were used to identify texts or statements that either did or did not require additional interpretation. A ''nītattha'' text required no explanation, while a ''neyyattha'' one might mislead some people unless properly explained:&lt;ref&gt;McCagney: 82&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|There are these two who misrepresent the [[Tathagata]].  Which two?  He who represents a [[Sūtra|Sutta]] of indirect meaning as a Sutta of direct meaning and he who represents a Sutta of direct meaning as a Sutta of indirect meaning.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anguttara Nikaya]]'' I:60 (Jayatilleke: 361, in McCagney: 82)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''{{IAST|Saṃmuti}}'' or ''{{IAST|samuti}}'' (Pāli; Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|saṃvṛti}}'', meaning "common consent, general opinion, convention",&lt;ref&gt;PED&lt;/ref&gt; and ''paramattha'' (Pāli; Sanskrit: ''paramārtha''), meaning "ultimate", are used to distinguish conventional or common-sense language, as used in metaphors or for the sake of convenience, from language used to express higher truths directly. The term ''vohāra'' (Pāli; Sanskrit: ''vyavahāra'', "common practice, convention, custom" is also used in more or less the same sense as ''samuti''.

====Theravāda====
The [[Theravada|Theravādin]] commentators expanded on these categories and began applying them not only to expressions but to the truth then expressed:
{{quote|The Awakened One, the best of teachers, spoke of two truths, conventional and higher; no third is ascertained; a conventional statement is true because of convention and a higher statement is true as disclosing the true characteristics of events.&lt;ref&gt;''{{IAST|Khathāvatthu Aṭṭha kathǎ}}'' (Jayatilleke: 363, in McCagney: 84)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Prajnāptivāda====
The [[Prajñaptivāda]] school took up the distinction between the conventional and ultimate (''paramārtha/{{IAST|saṃvṛti}}''), and extended the concept to [[Dharma#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|metaphysical-phenomenological constituents]] (''dharmas''), distinguishing those that are real (''tattva'') from those that are purely conceptual, i.e., ultimately nonexistent (''prajnāpti'').

===Indian Mahayana Buddhism===

====Madhyamaka====
The distinction between the two truths (''satyadvayavibhāga'') was fully developed by [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] (c. 150 – c. 250 CE) of the [[Madhyamaka]] school.{{sfn|Garfield|2002|p=91}} The Madhyamikas distinguish between ''loka-samvriti-satya'', "world speech truth" c.q. "relative truth"&lt;ref group=web name="urbandharma"&gt;[http://www.urbandharma.org/udnl2/nl031604.html ''The Urban Dharma Newsletter. March 16, 2004'']&lt;/ref&gt; c.q. "truth that keeps the ultimate truth concealed,"{{sfn|Chattopadhyaya|2001|=103-106}} and ''paramarthika satya'', ultimate truth.&lt;ref group=web name="urbandharma"/&gt;

''Loka-samvriti-satya'' can be further divided in ''tathya-samvrti'' or ''loka-samvrti'', and ''mithya-samvrti'' or ''aloka-samvrti'',{{sfn|Joshi|1977|p=174}}{{sfn|Nakamura|1980|p=285}}{{sfn|Dutt|1930}}{{sfn|Stcherbatsky|1989|p=54}} "true samvrti" and "false samvrti."{{sfn|Stcherbatsky|1989|p=54}}&lt;ref group=web name="urbandharma"/&gt;&lt;!--START OF NOTE--&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to Lal Mani Joshi, [[Bhāviveka]] (6th century CE), the founder of the [[Svātantrika]]subschool of the Mādhyamaka, classified ''samvrti'' into ''tathya-samvrti'' and ''mithya-samvrti''.{{sfn|Joshi|1977|p=174}} [[Candrakīrti]] (7th century CE), one of the main proponents of the [[Prasaṅgika]] subschool of Madhyamaka, divided ''samvrti'' into ''loka-samvrti'' and ''aloka-samvrti''.{{sfn|Joshi|1977|p=174}}{{sfn|Nakamura|1980|p=285}} [[Shantideva]] (8th century CE) and his commentator Prajñakaramati (950-1030&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Praj%C3%B1akaramati Rigpawiki, ''Prajñakaramati'']&lt;/ref&gt;) both use the terms ''tathya-samvrti'' and ''mithya-samvrti''.{{sfn|Dutt|1930}}{{sfn|Stcherbatsky|1989|p=54}} [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]], an influential 8th-century Mimamsa-philosopher, in commenting on Madhyamaka philosophy, also uses the terms ''loka-samvrti'' and ''aloka-samvrti''.{{sfn|Chattopadhyaya|2001|=103-106}} Murti, in his ''The Central Philosophy of Buddhism'', uses the term ''aloka'', and refers to the synonym ''mithya samvrti''.{{sfn|Murti|2013|p=245}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Murti: "In calling it 'loka samvrti,' it is implied that there is some appearance which is 'aloka' - non-empirical, i.e. false for the emprical consciousness even."{{sfn|Mrti|2013|p=245}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;David Seyfort Ruegg further comments: "The ''samvrti'' in worldly usage is termed ''lokasamvrti''; and while it can serve no real purpose to distinguish an ''alokasamvrti'' opposed to it (from the point of view of ultimate reality both are unreal, though in different degrees from the relative standpoint), one may nevertheless speak of an ''alokasamvrti'' as distinct from it when considering that there exist persons who can be described as 'not of the world' (''alokah'') since they have experiences which are falsified because of the fact that their sense-faculties are impaired (and which, therefore, do not belong to the general worldly consensus."{{sfn|Seyfort Ruegg|1981|p=74-75}}}}&lt;!--END OF NOTE--&gt; ''Tathya-samvrti'' or "true samvrti" refers to "things" which concretely exist and can be perceived as such by the senses, while ''mithya-samvrti'' or "false samvrti" refers to false cognitions of "things" which do not exist as they are perceived.{{sfn|Dutt|1930}}{{sfn|Stcherbatsky|1989|p=54}}{{sfn|Chattopadhyaya|2001|=103-106}}&lt;ref group=web name="Sulekha.com"&gt;[http://creative.sulekha.com/refutation-of-advaita-kumarila-part-2_325305_blog Sulekha.com, ''Refutation of Advaita:Kumarila Part 2'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--START OF NOTE--&gt;{{refn|group=note|An often-used explanation in Madhyamaka literature is the perception of a snake.

Ultimately both are false, but "the snake-seen-in-the-rope" is less true than the "snake-seen-in-the-snake." This gives an epitemological hierarchy in which ''tathya-samvrti'' stands above ''mithya-samvrti''.&lt;ref group=web name="urbandharma"/&gt;{{sfn|Chattopadhyaya|2001|=103-106}}&lt;ref group=web name="Sulekha.com"/&gt; Another example given in Madhyamaka literature to distinguish between ''tathya-samvrti'' and ''mithya-samvrti'' is "water-seen-in-the-pool" (''loka samvriti'') as contrasted with "water-seen-in-the-mirage" (''aloka samvriti'').}}&lt;!--END OF NOTE--&gt;&lt;!--START OF NOTE--&gt;{{refn|group=note|''Mithya-samvrti'' or "false samvrti" cam also be given as ''asatya'', "untruth."&lt;ref group=web name="urbandharma"/&gt; Compare Peter Harvey, noting that in [[Chandogya Upanishad]] 6.15.3 [[Brahman]] is ''satya'', and Richard Gombrich, commenting on the Upanishadic identity of microcosm and macrocosm, c.q. Atman and Brahman, which according to the Buddha is ''asat'', "something that does not exist."{{sfn|Gombrich|1990|p=15}} Compare also [[Atiśa]]: "One may wonder, "From where did all this come in the first place, and to where does it depart now?"

Nagarjuna's ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' provides a logical defense for the claim that all things are empty ([[sunyata]]) of an inherently-existing self-nature.{{sfn|Garfield|2002|p=91}} Sunyata, however, is also shown to be "empty," and Nagarjuna's assertion of "the emptiness of emptiness" prevents sunyata from constituting a higher or ultimate reality.{{sfn|Garfield|2002|p=38–39}}{{sfn|Siderits|2003}}{{refn|group=note|See also [http://emptinessteachings.com/2014/09/11/the-two-truths-of-buddhism-and-the-emptiness-of-emptiness/ Susan Kahn, ''The Two Truths of Buddhism and The Emptiness of Emptiness'']}}{{refn|group=note|Some have interpreted ''paramarthika satya'' or "ultimate truth" as constituting a metaphysical 'Absolute' or [[noumenon]], an "ineffable ultimate that transcends the capacities of discursive reason."{{sfn|Siderits|2003}} For example T.R.V. Murti (1955), ''The Central Philosophy of Buddhism'', who gave a [[Neo-Kantianism|Neo-Kantian]] interpretation.{{sfn|Westerhoff|2009|p=9}}}} Nagarjuna's view is that "the ultimate truth is that there is no ultimate truth".{{sfn|Siderits|2003}} According to Siderits, Nagarjuna is a "semantic anti-dualist" who posits that there are only conventional truths.{{sfn|Siderits|2003}} [[Jay L. Garfield]] explains:
{{quote|Suppose that we take a conventional entity, such as a table. We analyze it to demonstrate its emptiness, finding that there is no table apart from its parts [...] So we conclude that it is empty. But now let us analyze that emptiness […]. What do we find? Nothing at all but the table’s lack of inherent existence [...] To see the table as empty [...] is to see the table as conventional, as dependent.{{sfn|Garfield|2002|p=38–39}}}}

In [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]]'s ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' the two truths doctrine is used to defend the identification of dependent origination (''pratītyasamutpāda'') with emptiness (''śūnyatā''):
{{quote|The Buddha's teaching of the Dharma is based on two truths: a truth of worldly convention and an ultimate truth. Those who do not understand the distinction drawn between these two truths do not understand the Buddha's profound truth. Without a foundation in the conventional truth the significance of the ultimate cannot be taught. Without understanding the significance of the ultimate, liberation is not achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Nagarjuna, Mūlamadhyamakakārika 24:8–10. Jay L. Garfield|''Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way'': pp. 296, 298&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Nagarjuna's own words:
{{quote|8. The teaching by the Buddhas of the dharma has recourse to two truths:&lt;br&gt;
The world-ensconced truth and the truth which is the highest sense.&lt;br&gt;
9. Those who do not know the distribution (vibhagam) of the two kinds of truth&lt;br&gt;
Do not know the profound "point" (tattva) in the teaching of the Buddha.&lt;br&gt;
10. The highest sense of the truth is not taught apart from practical behavior,&lt;br&gt;
And without having understood the highest sense one cannot understand nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orientalia.org/article492.html Mūlamadhyamakakārikā Verse 24] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208100348/http://www.orientalia.org/article492.html |date=February 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] based his statement of the two truths on the Kaccāyanagotta Sutta. In the Kaccāyanagotta Sutta, the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], speaking to the monk Kaccayana Gotta on the topic of right view, describes the middle Way between nihilsm and eternalism:
{{quote|By and large, Kaccayana, this world is supported by a polarity, that of existence and non-existence. But when one sees the origination of the world as it actually is with right discernment, "non-existence" with reference to the world does not occur to one. When one sees the cessation of the world as it actually is with right discernment, "existence" with reference to the world does not occur to one.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn12-015.html Kaccāyanagotta Sutta on Access to Insight] (accessed: January 2, 2008) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511184737/http://accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn12-015.html |date=May 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Chattopadhyaya, although Nagarjuna presents his understanding of the two truths as a clarification of the teachings of the Buddha, the two truths doctrine as such is not part of the earliest Buddhist tradition.{{sfn|Chattopadhyaya|2001|p=21-3,94,104}}

====Buddhist Idealism====

=====Yogacara=====
The [[Yogacara]] school of Buddhism distinguishes the [[Yogacara#The Three Natures|Three Natures]] and the [[Trikaya]]. The Three Natures are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist Epistemology|author=S.R. Bhatt &amp; Anu Meherotra|pages=7|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''What is Living and What is Dead in Indian Philosophy'' 5th edition|author=Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya|pages=107|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Paramarthika'' (transcendental reality), also referred to as ''Parinispanna'' in Yogacara literature:''The level of a storehouse of consciousness that is responsible for the appearance of the world of external objects. It is the only ultimate reality.''
*''Paratantrika'' (dependent or empirical reality): ''The level of the empirical world experienced in ordinary life''. For example, the snake-seen-in-the-snake.
*''Parikalpita'' (imaginary). For example, the snake-seen-in-a-dream.

=====Lankavatara Sutra=====
The Lankavatara Sutra took an idealistic turn in apprehending reality. [[D. T. Suzuki]] writes the following:
{{quote|The ''Lanka'' is quite explicit in assuming two forms of knowledge: the one for grasping the absolute or entering into the realm of Mind-only, and the other for understanding existence in its dual aspect in which logic prevails and the Vijnanas are active. The latter is designated Discrimination (''vikalpa'') in the ''Lanka'' and the former transcendental wisdom or knowledge (''prajna''). To distinguish these two forms of knowledge is most essential in Buddhist philosophy.}}

When Buddhism came to China from [[Greco-Buddhism#Gandharan proselytism|Gandhara]] (now Afghanistan) and [[India]] in the first/second century CE, it was initially adapted to the Chinese culture and understanding. Buddhism was exposed to [[Confucianism|Confucianist]]{{sfn|Brown Holt|1995}} and [[Taoism|Taoist]]{{sfn|Goddard |2007|p=10}}{{sfn|Verstappen|2004|p=5}}{{sfn|Fowler|2005|p=79}} influences. [[Neo-Daoism|Neo-Taoist]] concepts were taken over in Chinese Buddhism.{{sfn|Oh|2000}} Concepts such as [[Essence-Function|"T’i -yung"]] (Essence and Function) and "Li-Shih" (Noumenon and Phenomenon) were first taken over by Hua-yen Buddhism,{{sfn|Oh|2000}} which consequently influenced Chán deeply.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=45-49}}

The two truths doctrine was another point of confusion. Chinese thinking took this to refer to two ''ontological truths'': reality exists of two levels, a relative level and an absolute level.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=11}} Taoists at first misunderstood [[sunyata]] to be akin to the Taoist non-being.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=8}} In Madhyamaka the two truths are two ''epistemological truths'': two different ways to look at reality. Based on their understanding of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra the Chinese supposed that the teaching of the Buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths.{{sfn|Lai|2003}}

====Hua-yen Buddhism====
{{Main article|Huayan school}}

The Huayan school or Flower Garland is a tradition of [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhist]] [[philosophy]] that flourished in [[China]] during the [[Tang period]]. It is based on the Sanskrit [[Avatamsaka Sutra|Flower Garland Sutra]] (S. ''Avataṃsaka Sūtra'', C. ''Huayan Jing'') and on a lengthy Chinese interpretation of it, the [[Huayan Lun]].  The name Flower Garland is meant to suggest the crowning glory of profound understanding.

The most important philosophical contributions of the Huayan school were in the area of its metaphysics. It taught the doctrine of the mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena, as expressed in [[Indra's net]]. One thing contains all other existing things, and all existing things contain that one thing.

Distinctive features of this approach to Buddhist philosophy include:
* Truth (or reality) is understood as encompassing and interpenetrating falsehood (or illusion), and vice versa
* Good is understood as encompassing and interpenetrating evil
* Similarly, all mind-made distinctions are understood as "collapsing" in the enlightened understanding of emptiness (a tradition traced back to the Buddhist philosopher [[Nagarjuna]])

Huayan teaches the [[Four Dharmadhatu]], four ways to view reality:
# All dharmas are seen as particular separate events;
# All events are an expression of the absolute;
# Events and essence interpenetrate;
# All events interpenetrate.{{sfn|Garfield|2011|p=76}}

====Absolute and relative in Zen====
{{main article|Zen}}
[[File:DogenP2.JPG|thumb|[[Dogen]]]]

The teachings of Zen are expressed by a set of polarities: Buddha-nature - sunyata,{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|pp=26–29}}{{sfn|McRae|2003|pp=138–142}} absolute-relative,{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}} sudden and gradual enlightenment.{{sfn|McRae|2003|pp=123–138}}

The [[Prajnaparamita|Prajnaparamita Sutras]] and [[Madhyamaka]] emphasized the non-duality of form and emptiness: form is emptiness, emptiness is form, as the [[Heart Sutra]] says.{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}}
The idea that the ultimate reality is present in the daily world of relative reality fitted into the Chinese culture which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not tell how the absolute is present in the relative world. This question is answered in such schemata as [[Five Ranks|the Five Ranks of Tozan]]{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|p=29}} and the [[Ten Bulls|Oxherding Pictures]].

====Essence-function in Korean Buddhism====
{{See also|Korean Buddhism|Essence-Function}}

The polarity of absolute and relative is also expressed as "essence-function". The absolute is essence, the relative is function. They can't be seen as separate realities, but interpenetrate each other. The distinction does not "exclude any other frameworks such as ''neng-so'' or "subject-object" constructions", though the two "are completely different from each other in terms of their way of thinking".&lt;ref&gt;Park, Sung-bae  (1983). ''Buddhist Faith and Sudden Enlightenment.'' SUNY series in religious studies. SUNY Press. {{ISBN|0-87395-673-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87395-673-4}}.

In Korean Buddhism, essence-function is also expressed as "body" and "the body's functions":
{{quote|[A] more accurate definition (and the one the Korean populace is more familiar with) is "body" and "the body's functions". The implications of "essence/function" and "body/its functions" are similar, that is, both paradigms are used to point to a nondual relationship between the two concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Park, Sung-bae (2009). ''One Korean's approach to Buddhism: the mom/momjit paradigm''. SUNY series in Korean studies: SUNY Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-7697-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-7697-0}}.

A metaphor for essence-function is "A lamp and its light", a phrase from the ''[[Platform Sutra]]'', where Essence is lamp and Function is light.&lt;ref&gt;Lai, Whalen (1979). "Ch'an Metaphors: waves, water, mirror, lamp". ''Philosophy East &amp; West''; Vol. 29, no.3, July, 1979, pp.245–253.

===Tibetan Buddhism===

====Nyingma====
The '''Nyingma''' tradition is the oldest of the four major schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. It is founded on the first translations of Buddhist scriptures from [[Sanskrit]] into [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]], in the eighth century. [[Ju Mipham]] (1846–1912) in his commentary to the ''[[Madhyamālaṃkāra]]'' of [[Śāntarakṣita]] (725–788) says:&lt;ref&gt;Commentary to the first [[couplet]] of [[quatrain]]/[[śloka]] 72 of the root text, (725–788) — Blumenthal, James (2008). "Śāntarakṣita", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). Source: [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/saantarak-sita/] (accessed: February 28, 2009), as rendered into English by the [[Padmakara Translation Group]] (2005: p. 304)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|If one trains for a long time in the union of the two truths, the stage of acceptance (on the path of joining), which is attuned to primordial wisdom, will arise. By thus acquiring a certain conviction in that which surpasses intellectual knowledge, and by training in it, one will eventually actualize it. This is precisely how the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas have said that liberation is to be gained.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shantarakshita]] (author); [[Ju Mipham]] (commentator); [[Padmakara Translation Group]] (translators)(2005). ''The Adornment of the Middle Way: Shantarakshita's Madhyamakalankara with commentary by Jamgön Mipham.'' Boston, Massachusetts, US: Shambhala Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|1-59030-241-9}} (alk. paper), p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|"Primordial wisdom" is a rendering of ''[[jñāna]]'' and "that which surpasses intellectual knowledge" may be understood as the direct perception (Sanskrit: ''[[pratyakṣa]]'') of(''[[dharmata|dharmatā]]''). "Conviction" may be understood as a gloss of [[Faith in Buddhism|faith]] (''śraddhā'').  An effective analogue for "union", a rendering of the relationship held by the two truths, is ''[[Interpenetration (Buddhism)|interpenetration]]''.}}}}

The following sentence from [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham]]'s exegesis of [[Śāntarakṣita]]'s'' [[Madhyamālaṃkāra]]'' highlights the relationship between the absence of ''[[Catuṣkoṭi#Four Extremes|the four extremes]]'' (''mtha'-bzhi'') and the [[nondual]] or ''[[Two Truths|indivisible two truths]]'' (''bden-pa dbyer-med''):
{{quote|The learned and accomplished [masters] of the Early Translations considered this simplicity beyond the four extremes, this abiding way in which the two truths are indivisible, as their own immaculate way.&lt;ref&gt;Doctor, Thomas H. (trans.) Mipham, Jamgon Ju.(author)(2004). '' Speech of Delight: Mipham's Commentary of Shantarakshita's Ornament of the Middle Way''. Ithaca: Snow Lion Publications. {{ISBN|1-55939-217-7}}, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|[[Helena Blankleder|Blankleder]] and [[Wulstan Fletcher|Fletcher]] of the [[Padmakara Translation Group]] give a somewhat different translation:&lt;br&gt;
"The learned and accomplished masters of the Old Translation school take as their stainless view the freedom from all conceptual constructs of the four extremes, the ultimate reality of the two truths inseparably united."&lt;ref&gt;[[Shantarakshita]] (author); [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham]] (commentator); [[Padmakara Translation Group]] (translators)(2005). ''The Adornment of the Middle Way: Shantarakshita's Madhyamakalankara with commentary by Jamgön Mipham.'' Boston, Massachusetts, US: Shambhala Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|1-59030-241-9}} (alk. paper), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

====Dzogchen====
[[Dzogchen]] holds that the two truths are ultimately resolved into non-duality as a lived experience and are non-different.

==Understanding in other traditions==

===Jainism===
The Jain philosopher [[Kundakunda]] was influenced by Nagarjuna to develop a Jain version of the theory of two truths.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Jeffery; Jainism: An Introduction, page 66.&lt;/ref&gt; In texts such as Pravacanasāra
(‘The Essence of the Doctrine’) and Samayasāra (‘The Essence of the Soul’), Kundakunda distinguishes between two perspectives of truth:

*''vyavahāranaya'' or ‘mundane perspective’
*''niścayanaya'' or ‘ultimate perspective’, also called “supreme” (''paramārtha'') and “pure” (''śuddha'')&lt;ref&gt;Long, Jeffery; Jainism: An Introduction, page 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Kundakunda, the mundane realm of truth is also the relative perspective of normal folk, where the workings of [[karma]] operate and where things emerge, last for a certain duration and perish. The ultimate perspective meanwhile, is that of the liberated [[jiva]], which is "blissful, energetic, perceptive, and omniscient".&lt;ref&gt;Long, Jeffery; Jainism: An Introduction, page 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advaita Vedanta===
Advaita took over from the Madhyamika the idea of levels of reality.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=130}} Usually two levels are being mentioned,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} but Shankara uses [[Advaita vedanta#Criterion of Sublation|sublation]] as the criterion to postulate an ontological hierarchy of three levels.{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination&gt;[http://www.advaita-vision.org/discrimination/ advaita-vision.org, ''Discrimination'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to Chattopadhyaya, the Advaita Vedantists retain the term paramartha-satya or parmarthika-satya for the ultimate truth, and for the ''loka samvriti'' of the Madhyamakas they use the term ''vyahvarika satya'' and for ''aloka samvriti'' they use the term ''pratibhasika'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''What is Living and What is Dead in Indian Philosophy'' 5th edition|author=Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya|pages=107, 104|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* {{IAST|Pāramārthika}} (paramartha, absolute), the absolute level, "which is absolutely real and into which both other reality levels can be resolved".&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination /&gt; This experience can't be sublated by any other experience.{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}
* {{IAST|Vyāvahārika}} (vyavahara), or samvriti-saya{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} (empirical or pragmatical), "our world of experience, the phenomenal world that we handle every day when we are awake".&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination /&gt; It is the level in which both ''[[jiva]]'' (living creatures or individual souls) and ''[[Iswara]]'' are true; here, the material world is also true.
* {{IAST|Prāthibhāsika}} (pratibhasika, apparent reality, unreality), "reality based on imagination alone".&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination /&gt; It is the level in which appearances are actually false, like the illusion of a snake over a rope, or a dream.

===Mīmāṃsā refutation of Two Truths Doctrine===
Chattopadhyaya notes that the eighth-century [[Mīmāṃsā]] philosopher [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]] rejected the ''Two Truths Doctrine'' in his ''Shlokavartika''.&lt;ref name="Bhaṭṭa"/&gt; Bhaṭṭa was highly influential with his defence of the Vedic rituals against medieval [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] rejections of these rituals. Some believe that his influence contributed to the [[decline of Buddhism in India]]{{sfn|Sheridan|1995|p=198-201}} since his lifetime coincides with the period in which Buddhism began to decline.{{sfn|Sharma|1980|p=5-6}} According to Kumarila, the two truths doctrine is an idealist doctrine, which conceals the fact that "the theory of the nothingness of the objective world" is absurd:
{{quote|[O]ne should admit that what does not exist, exists not; and what does exist, exists in the full sense. The latter alone is true, and the former false. But the idealist just cannot afford to do this. He is obliged instead to talk of 'two truths', senseless though this be.&lt;ref name="Bhaṭṭa"/&gt;&lt;!--START OF NOTE--&gt;{{refn|group=note|Kumārila Bhaṭṭa: "The idealist talks of some 'apparent truth' or 'provisional truth of practical life', i.e. in his terminology, of ''samvriti satya''. However, since in his own view, there is really no truth in this 'apparent truth', what is the sense of asking us to look at it as some special brand of truth as it were? If there is truth in it, why call it false at all? And, if it is really false, why call it a kind of truth?

Truth and falsehood, being mutually exclusive, there cannot be any factor called 'truth' as belonging in common to both--no more than there can by any common factor called 'treeness' belonging to both the tree and the lion, which are mutually exclusive.

On the idealist's own assumption, this 'apparent truth' is nothing but a synonym for the 'false'. Why, then, does he use this expression? Because it serves for him a very important purpose. It is the purpose of a verbal hoax. It means falsity, though with such a pedantic air about it as to suggest something apparently different, as it were. This is in fact a well known trick. Thus, to create a pedantic air, one can use the word ''vaktrasava'' [literally mouth-wine] instead of the simpler word ''lala'', meaning saliva [''vancanartha upanyaso lala-vaktrasavadivat''].

But why is this pedantic air? Why, instead of simply talking of falsity, is the verbal hoax of an 'apparent truth' or samvriti? The purpose of conceiving this samvriti is only to conceal the absurdity of the theory of the nothingness of the objective world, so that it can somehow be explained why things are imagined as actually existing when they are not so.

Instead of playing such verbal tricks, therefore, one should speak honestly. This means: one should admit that what does not exist, exists not; and what does exist, exists in the full sense. The latter alone is true, and the former false. But the idealist just cannot afford to do this. He is obliged instead to talk of 'two truths', senseless though this be."&lt;ref name="Bhaṭṭa"&gt;{{cite book|title=''What is Living and What is Dead in Indian Philosophy'' 5th edition|author=Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya|pages=370–1|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;!--END OF NOTE--&gt;}}

===Correspondence with Pyrrhonism===
[[Thomas McEvilley|McEvilley]] (2002) notes a correspondence between Greek [[Pyrrhonism]] and [[Madhyamika]] doctrines:
{{quote|Sextus says &lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empericus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', II.14–18; ''Anthologia Palatina'' (Palatine Anthology), VII. 29–35, and elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt; that there are two criteria:
# [T]hat by which we judge reality and unreality, and
# [T]hat which we use as a guide in everyday life.
According to the first criterion, nothing is either true or false[.] [I]nductive statements based on direct observation of phenomena may be treated as either true or false for the purpose of making everyday practical decisions.&lt;br&gt;
The distinction, as Conze&lt;ref&gt;Conze 1959, pp. 140–141)&lt;/ref&gt; has noted, is equivalent to the Madhyamika distinction between "Absolute truth" (''paramārthasatya''), "the knowledge of the real as it is without any distortion,"&lt;ref name="Conze 1959: p. 244"&gt;Conze (1959: p. 244)&lt;/ref&gt; and "Truth so-called" (''saṃvṛti satya''), "truth as conventionally believed in common parlance.&lt;ref name="Conze 1959: p. 244"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Thomas | last=McEvilley | title=The Shape of Ancient Thought | publisher=Allworth Communications | year=2002 | isbn=1-58115-203-5 }}, p. 474&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8940">In [[computer science]], a '''type signature''' or '''type annotation''' defines the inputs and outputs for a function, [[subroutine]] or [[Method (computer programming)|method]]. A type signature includes the number of arguments, the types of arguments and the order of the arguments contained by a function. A type signature is typically used during [[Type polymorphism|overload]] resolution for choosing the correct definition of a function to be called among many overloaded forms.

==Examples==
===C/C++===
In [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], the type signature is [[Declaration (computer programming)|declared]] by what is commonly known as a [[function prototype]]. In C/C++, a function [[declaration reflects use|declaration reflects its use]]; for example, a [[function pointer]] that would be invoked as:
&lt;source lang=C&gt;
char c;
double d;
int retVal = (*fPtr)(c, d);
&lt;/source&gt;

has the signature:

&lt;source lang=C&gt;
(int) (char, double);
&lt;/source&gt;

===Erlang===
In [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]], type signatures may be optionally declared, as:
&lt;source lang=Erlang&gt;
-spec(function_name(type1(), type2(), ...) -&gt; out_type()).
&lt;/source&gt;

For example:
&lt;source lang=Erlang&gt;
-spec(is_even(number()) -&gt; boolean()).
&lt;/source&gt;

===Haskell===
A type signature in the [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell programming language]] is generally written in the following format:
&lt;source lang=Haskell&gt;
functionName :: arg1Type -&gt; arg2Type -&gt; ... -&gt; argNType
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that the type of the result can be regarded as everything past the first supplied argument. This is a consequence of [[currying]], which is made possible by Haskell's support for [[first-class function]]s; this function requires two inputs where one argument supplied and the function is "curried" to produce a function for the argument not supplied. Thus calling {{Haskell|f x}}, where {{Haskell|f :: a -&gt; b -&gt; c}}, yields a new function {{Haskell|f2 :: b -&gt; c}} that can be called {{Haskell|f2 b}} to produce {{Haskell|c}}.

The actual type specifications can consist of an actual type, such as {{Haskell|Integer}}, or a general [[type variable]] that is used in [[type polymorphism|parametric polymorphic]] [[function (programming)|functions]], such as {{Haskell|a}}, or {{Haskell|b}}, or {{Haskell|anyType}}. So we can write something like:
{{Haskell|functionName :: a -&gt; a -&gt; ... -&gt; a}}

Since Haskell supports [[higher-order function]]s, functions can be passed as arguments. This is written as:
{{Haskell|functionName :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a}}

This function takes in a function with type signature {{Haskell|a -&gt; a}} and returns data of type {{Haskell|a}} out.

===Java===
In the [[Java virtual machine]], ''internal type signatures'' are used to identify methods and classes at the level of the virtual machine code.

Example: The method {{Java|String String.substring(int, int)}} is represented in [[Java bytecode|bytecode]] as {{Java|Ljava/lang/String.substring(II)Ljava/lang/String;}}. The signature of &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method looks like this:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
&lt;/source&gt;

And in the disassembled bytecode, it takes the form of {{Java|Lsome/package/Main/main:([Ljava/lang/String;)V}}

The method signature for the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method contains three modifiers:

* &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method can be called by any object.
* &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method is a class method.
* &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method has no return value.

==Signature==
{{tone|section|date=October 2013}}
A function signature consists of the function prototype.  It specifies the general information about a function like the name, scope and parameters.  Many programming languages use [[name mangling]] in order to pass along more semantic information from the compilers to the linkers.  In addition to mangling, there is an excess of information in a function signature (stored internally to most compilers) which is not readily available, but may be accessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C++ Reference: Programming terms|url=http://www.cs.unm.edu/~storm/C++/ProgrammingTerms/FunctionSignatures.html|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding the notion of a function signature is an important concept for all computer science studies.
* Modern object orientation techniques make use of [[Java interface|interfaces]], which are essentially templates made from function signatures.
* C/C++ uses function overloading with various signatures.

The practice of [[multiple inheritance]] requires consideration of the function signatures to avoid unpredictable results.

Computer science theory, and the concept of [[Polymorphism in object-oriented programming|polymorphism]] in particular, make much use of the concept of function signature.

In the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] signature is roughly equivalent to its [[Function prototype|prototype definition]].

The term "signature" may carry other meanings in computer science. For example:
* [[File signature]]s can identify or verify the content of a file.
* Database signatures can identify or verify the schema or a version of a database.
* In the [[ML programming language|ML]] family of [[programming language]]s, "signature" is used as a keyword referring to a construct of the module system that plays the role of an [[interface (computer science)|interface]].

==Method signature==
{{See also|Function prototype}}

In [[computer programming]], especially [[object-oriented programming]], a [[Method (computer programming)|method]] is commonly identified by its unique '''method signature''', which usually includes the method name, and the number, types and order of its [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| accessdate = 2011-05-31
| author = Paul Leahy
| location = http://www.about.com/
| publisher = About.com Guide
| title = Method Signature
| quote = A method signature is part of the method declaration. It is the combination of the method name and the parameter list.
| url = http://java.about.com/od/m/g/methodsignature.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A method signature is the smallest [[datatype|type]] of a method.

==Examples==
===C/C++===
In [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]], the method signature is the method name and the number and type of its [[parameter]]s, but it is possible to have a last parameter that consists of an array of values:
&lt;source lang=C&gt;
int printf(const char*, ... );
&lt;/source&gt;

Manipulation of these parameters can be done by using the routines in the standard library header [[stdarg.h|{{C-lang|&lt;stdarg.h&gt;}}]].

===C#===
Similar to the C syntax, [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] sees as the method signature its name and the number and type of its parameters, where the last parameter may be an array of values:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
| accessdate = 2011-08-03
| date       = 2002-03-25
| first      = Hanspeter
| last       = Mössenböck
| location   = http://ssw.jku.at/Teaching/Lectures/CSharp/Tutorial/

| title      = Advanced C#: Variable Number of Parameters
| url        = http://ssw.jku.at/Teaching/Lectures/CSharp/Tutorial/Part1.pdf}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=Csharp&gt;
void Add(out int sum, params int[] value);
[...]
Add(out sum, 3, 5, 7, 11, -1);  // sum == 25
&lt;/source&gt;

===Java===
In the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]], a method signature is the method name and the number, type and order of its parameters. Return types and thrown exceptions are not considered to be a part of the method signature. 
&lt;source lang=Java&gt;
methodName(parameters) {...};
break;
&lt;/source&gt;

For example, the following two methods have distinct signatures:
&lt;source lang=Java&gt;
doSomething(String[] y);
doSomething(String y);
&lt;/source&gt;

The following three methods do have the same signatures and are considered the same, as only the return value differs. The name of the parameter is not part of the method signature and is ignored by the compiler for checking method uniqueness.
&lt;source lang=Java&gt;
int doSomething(int y) 
String doSomething(int x)
int doSomething(int z) throws java.lang.Exception
&lt;/source&gt;

===Objective-C===
In the [[Objective-C]] programming language, method signatures for an object are declared in the interface header file. For example,
&lt;source lang=ObjC&gt;
- (id)initWithInt:(int)value;
&lt;/source&gt;

defines a method {{ObjC|initWithInt}} that returns a general object (an {{ObjC|id}}) and takes one integer argument. Objective-C only requires a type in a signature to be explicit when the type is not {{ObjC|id}}; this signature is equivalent:
&lt;source lang=ObjC&gt;
- initWithInt:(int)value;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Classification==
Vertigo is classified into either peripheral or central depending on the location of the dysfunction of the vestibular pathway,&lt;ref name="Hearing loss"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wippold 2nd|first1=FJ|last2=Turski|first2=PA|title=Vertigo and hearing loss|journal=American Journal of Neuroradiology|year=2009|volume=30|issue=8|pages=1623–1625|pmid=19749077|url=http://www.ajnr.org/content/30/8/1623.long|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205084120/http://www.ajnr.org/content/30/8/1623.long|archivedate=2013-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  although it can also be caused by psychological factors.&lt;ref name="urlChapter 14: Evaluation of the Dizzy Patient"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dons/part_2/chapter_14.html#chpt_14_evaluation|title=Chapter 14: Evaluation of the Dizzy Patient|format=|work=|accessdate=2009-08-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706143716/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dons/part_2/chapter_14.html#chpt_14_evaluation|archivedate=2009-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vertigo can also be classified into objective, subjective, and pseudovertigo. Objective vertigo describes when the person has the sensation that stationary objects in the environment are moving.&lt;ref name="Merck &amp; Co Inc"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Merck manual of diagnostics and therapy|year=1992|publisher=Merck &amp; Co Inc.|location=Rahway|pages=2844|editor=Berkow R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjective vertigo refers to when the person feels as if they are moving.&lt;ref name="Merck &amp; Co Inc"/&gt; The third type is known as pseudovertigo, an intensive sensation of rotation inside the person's head. While this classification appears in textbooks, it has little to do with the [[pathophysiology]] or treatment of vertigo.&lt;ref name="Adams and Victor’s Principles of Neurology"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ropper|first=AH|title=Adams and Victor’s Principles of Neurology|year=2005|location=NY, Chicago, San Francisco|pages=1398|edition=eighth|author2=Brown RH }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peripheral===
Vertigo that is caused by problems with the [[inner ear]] or [[vestibular system]], which is composed of the [[semicircular canal]]s, the [[vestibule of the ear|vestibule]] ([[utricle (ear)|utricle]] and [[saccule]]), and the [[vestibular nerve]] is called "peripheral", "otologic" or "vestibular" vertigo.&lt;ref name="Medline"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001432.htm |title=Vertigo-associated disorders |author=U.S. National Library of Medicine |year=2011 |work= |publisher=National Institutes of Health |accessdate=2 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125053802/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001432.htm |archivedate=25 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Karatas2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karatas|first=M|title=Central Vertigo and Dizziness|journal=The Neurologist|year=2008|volume=14|issue=6|pages=355–364|doi=10.1097/NRL.0b013e31817533a3|pmid=19008741}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common cause is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo ([[BPPV]]), which accounts for 32% of all peripheral vertigo.&lt;ref name="Karatas2008" /&gt; Other causes include [[Ménière's disease]] (12%), [[superior canal dehiscence syndrome]], [[labyrinthitis]], and visual vertigo.&lt;ref name="Karatas2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Visual vertigo: symptom assessment, spatial orientation and postural control|journal=Brain|volume=124|issue=8|pages=1646–1656|year=2001|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/124/8/1646|doi=10.1093/brain/124.8.1646|last1=Guerraz|first1=M.|pmid=11459755|last2=Yardley|first2=L|last3=Bertholon|first3=P|last4=Pollak|first4=L|last5=Rudge|first5=P|last6=Gresty|first6=MA|last7=Bronstein|first7=AM|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217020751/http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/124/8/1646|archivedate=2010-02-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Any cause of inflammation such as [[common cold]], [[influenza]], and bacterial infections may cause transient vertigo if it involves the inner ear, as may chemical insults (e.g., [[aminoglycoside]]s)&lt;ref name="aminoglycoside"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xie|first1=J|last2=Talaska|first2=AE|last3=Schacht|first3=J|title=New developments in aminoglycoside therapy and ototoxicity|journal=Hearing Research |year=2011|volume=281|issue=1–2|pages=28–37|pmid=21640178|doi=10.1016/j.heares.2011.05.008|pmc=3169717}}&lt;/ref&gt; or physical trauma (e.g., skull fractures).  [[Motion sickness]] is sometimes classified as a cause of peripheral vertigo.

People with peripheral vertigo typically present with mild to moderate [[balance disorder|imbalance]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[deafness|hearing loss]], [[tinnitus]], fullness, and pain in the ear.&lt;ref name="Karatas2008" /&gt; In addition, lesions of the internal auditory canal may be associated with facial weakness on the same side.&lt;ref name="Karatas2008" /&gt; Due to a rapid compensation process, acute vertigo as a result of a peripheral lesion tends to improve in a short period of time (days to weeks).&lt;ref name="Karatas2008" /&gt;

Vertigo that arises from injury to the balance centers of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), often from a lesion in the [[brainstem]] or [[cerebellum]],&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt;&lt;ref name="Medline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Advances"/&gt; is called "central" vertigo and is generally associated with less prominent movement illusion and [[nausea]] than vertigo of peripheral origin.&lt;ref name="Dieterich (2007)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dieterich|first=Marianne|title=Central vestibular disorders|journal=Journal of Neurology|year=2007|volume=254|pages=559–568|doi=10.1007/s00415-006-0340-7|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x62437220t306gr6/|issue=5|pmid=17417688}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Central vertigo may have accompanying [[neurological deficit|neurologic deficits]] (such as [[slurred speech]] and [[diplopia|double vision]]), and [[pathologic nystagmus]] (which is pure vertical/torsional).&lt;ref name="Karatas2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dieterich (2007)" /&gt; Central pathology can cause [[Equilibrioception|disequilibrium]] which is the sensation of being off balance. The [[balance disorder]] associated with central lesions causing vertigo is often so severe that many patients are unable to stand or walk.&lt;ref name="Karatas2008" /&gt;

A number of conditions that involve the central nervous system may lead to vertigo including:  lesions caused by [[infarction]]s or [[hemorrhagic stroke|hemorrhage]], [[brain tumor|tumors]] present in the [[cerebellopontine angle]] such as a [[vestibular schwannoma]] or cerebellar tumors,&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hearing loss"/&gt; [[epilepsy]],&lt;ref name="adolescent"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=J|last2=Goodkin|first2=HP|title=Dizziness and vertigo in the adolescent|journal=Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America|year=2011|volume=44|issue=2|pages=309–321|pmid=21474006|doi=10.1016/j.otc.2011.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cervical spine]] disorders such as [[cervical spondylosis]],&lt;ref name="Hearing loss"/&gt; degenerative ataxia disorders,&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt; [[Migraine|migraine headaches]],&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt; [[lateral medullary syndrome]], [[Chiari malformation]],&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt; [[multiple sclerosis]],&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt; [[parkinsonism]], as well as cerebral dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Karatas2008" /&gt; Central vertigo may not improve or may do so more slowly than vertigo caused by disturbance to peripheral structures.&lt;ref name="Karatas2008" /&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Vertigo is a sensation of spinning while stationary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec06/ch080/ch080c.html |title=Vertigo: Dizziness and Vertigo: Merck Manual Home Edition |work= |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213014133/http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec06/ch080/ch080c.html |archivedate=2010-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is commonly associated with [[nausea]] or [[vomiting]],&lt;ref name="adolescent"/&gt; [[balance disorder|unsteadiness]] (postural instability),&lt;ref name="Advances"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jahn |first1=K|last2=Dieterich|first2=M| title=Recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of balance disorders| journal=Journal of Neurology |volume=258 |issue=12 |pages=2305–2308|date=December 2011|pmid=22037955|doi=10.1007/s00415-011-6286-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; falls,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Vieira |first1=ER|last2=Freund-Heritage|first2=R|last3=Da Costa|first3=BR| title=Risk factors for geriatric patient falls in rehabilitation hospital settings: a systematic review| journal=Clinical Rehabilitation |volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=788–799|date=September 2011|pmid=21504956|doi=10.1177/0269215511400639}}&lt;/ref&gt; changes to a person's thoughts, and difficulties in walking.&lt;ref name="Rehab"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1413-35552010000500003&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|last1=Ricci|first1=NA|last2=Aratani|first2=MC|last3=Doná|first3=F|last4=MacEdo|first4=C|last5=Caovilla|first5=HH|last6=Ganança|first6=FF|title=A systematic review about the effects of the vestibular rehabilitation of middle-age and older adults|journal=Revista brasileira de fisioterapia|volume=14|issue=5|pages=361–371|year=2010|pmid=21180862|doi=10.1590/S1413-35552010000500003|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627225603/http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1413-35552010000500003&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|archivedate=2013-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recurrent episodes in those with vertigo are common and frequently impair the [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt; [[Blurred vision]], difficulty in speaking, a lowered level of [[consciousness]], and hearing loss may also occur. The signs and symptoms of vertigo can present as a persistent (insidious) onset or an episodic (sudden) onset.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Strupp|first1=M|last2=Thurtell|first2=MJ|last3=Shaikh|first3=AG|last4=Brandt|first4=T|last5=Zee|first5=DS|last6=Leigh|first6=RJ| title=Pharmacotherapy of vestibular and ocular motor disorders, including nystagmus| journal=Journal of Neurology |volume= 258 |issue=7 |pages=1207–1222|date=July 2011|pmid=21461686|doi=10.1007/s00415-011-5999-8 | pmc= 3132281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persistent onset vertigo is characterized by symptoms lasting for longer than one day&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; and is caused by degenerative changes that affect balance as people age. Naturally, the nerve conduction slows with aging and a decreased vibratory sensation is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Kaneko|first1=A|last2=Asai|first2=N|last3=Kanda|first3=T|title=The influence of age on pressure perception of static and moving two-point discrimination in normal subjects| journal=Journal of Hand Therapy|volume= 18 |issue=4 |pages=421–424|year= 2005 |pmid=16271689 |doi=10.1197/j.jht.2005.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, there is a degeneration of the [[osseous ampullae|ampulla]] and [[otolith]] organs with an increase in age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Kutz Jr|first1=JW| title=The dizzy patient| journal=Medical Clinics of North America |volume= 94 |issue=5 |pages=989–1002|date=September 2010|pmid=20736108|doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2010.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persistent onset is commonly paired with central vertigo signs and symptoms.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

The characteristics of an episodic onset vertigo are indicated by symptoms lasting for a smaller, more memorable amount of time, typically lasting for only seconds to minutes.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; Typically, episodic vertigo is correlated with peripheral symptoms.

==Pathophysiology==
The neurochemistry of vertigo includes six primary [[neurotransmitter]]s that have been identified between the three-neuron arc&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jn.physiology.org/content/92/1/20.long|last1=Angelaki|first1=DE|title=Eyes on target: what neurons must do for the vestibuloocular reflex during linear motion|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|volume=92|issue=1|pages=20–35|date=July 2004|pmid=15212435|doi=10.1152/jn.00047.2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306072618/http://jn.physiology.org/content/92/1/20.long|archivedate=2016-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that drives the [[vestibulo-ocular reflex]] (VOR). Glutamate maintains the resting discharge of the central vestibular neurons and may modulate [[chemical synapse|synaptic transmission]] in all three neurons of the VOR arc. Acetylcholine appears to function as an excitatory neurotransmitter in both the peripheral and central synapses. [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid]] (GABA) is thought to be inhibitory for the commissures of the [[medial vestibular nucleus]], the connections between the cerebellar [[Purkinje cells]], and the [[lateral vestibular nucleus]], and the vertical VOR.

Three other neurotransmitters work centrally. [[Dopamine]] may accelerate vestibular compensation. [[Norepinephrine]] modulates the intensity of central reactions to vestibular stimulation and facilitates compensation. [[Histamine]] is present only centrally, but its role is unclear. Dopamine, histamine, [[serotonin]], and acetylcholine are neurotransmitters thought to produce vomiting.&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt; It is known that centrally acting antihistamines modulate the symptoms of acute symptomatic vertigo.&lt;ref name="Australia"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.racgp.org.au/afpbackissues/2008/200806/200806kuo.pdf|last1=Kuo|first1=CH|last2=Pang|first2=L|last3=Chang|first3=R|title=Vertigo-part 2-management in general practice|journal=Australian Family Physician|volume=37|issue=6|pages=409–413|date=June 2008|pmid=18523693|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019153639/http://www.racgp.org.au/afpbackissues/2008/200806/200806kuo.pdf|archivedate=2013-10-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnostic approach==
Tests for vertigo often attempt to elicit nystagmus and to differentiate vertigo from other causes of dizziness such as [[presyncope]], [[hyperventilation syndrome]], [[Equilibrioception|disequilibrium]], or psychiatric causes of lightheadedness.&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt; Tests of [[vestibular system]] (balance) function include [[electronystagmography]] (ENG),&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt; Dix-Hallpike maneuver,&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt; rotation tests, head-thrust test,&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt; [[caloric reflex test]],&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcm.edu/oto/studs/vertigo.html |title=Core Curriculum: Inner Ear Disease&amp;nbsp;—Vertigo |publisher=Baylor College of Medicine |date=23 January 2006|accessdate=19 September 2007|work= |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070630173414/http://www.bcm.edu/oto/studs/vertigo.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Posturography|computerized dynamic posturography]] (CDP).&lt;ref name="tests"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vestibular.org/understanding-vestibular-disorder/diagnosis |title=Diagnosis: How are vestibular disorders diagnosed? |year=2013 |work= |publisher=Vestibular Disorders Association |accessdate=9 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122002724/http://vestibular.org/understanding-vestibular-disorder/diagnosis |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HINTS test, which is a combination of three physical exam tests that may be performed by physicians at the bedside has been deemed helpful in differentiating between central and peripheral causes of vertigo. The HINTS test involves the horizontal head impulse test, observation of nystagmus on primary gaze, and the test of skew.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Does my dizzy patient have a stroke?

Tests of [[auditory system]] (hearing) function include [[pure tone audiometry]], speech audiometry, [[acoustic reflex]], [[electrocochleography]] (ECoG), [[otoacoustic emissions]] (OAE), and the [[Auditory brainstem response|auditory brainstem response test]].&lt;ref name="tests"/&gt;

A number of specific conditions can cause vertigo.  In the elderly, however, the condition is often multifactorial.&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt;

A recent history of [[underwater diving]] can indicate a possibility of barotrauma or decompression sickness involvement but does not exclude all other possibilities. The dive profile (which is frequently recorded by [[dive computer]]) can be useful to assess a probability for decompression sickness, which can be confirmed by [[therapeutic recompression]].&lt;ref name="Nachum et al 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nachum|first1=Z|last2=Shupak|first2=A|last3=Spitzer|first3=O|last4=Sharoni|first4=Z|last5=Doweck|first5=I|last6=Gordon|first6=C.R.|title=Inner ear decompression sickness in sport compressed-air diving.|journal=The Laryngoscope|publisher=The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.|location=Philadelphia|date=May 2001|volume=111|issue=5|pages=851–6.|doi=10.1097/00005537-200105000-00018|pmid=11359165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo===
[[Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo]] (BPPV) is the most common vestibular disorder&lt;ref name=Bre2011/&gt; and occurs when loose [[calcium carbonate]] debris has broken off of the otoconial membrane and enters a semicircular canal thereby creating the sensation of motion.&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt; Patients with BPPV may experience brief periods of vertigo, usually under a minute,&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt; which occur with change in the position.&lt;ref name="Benign"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001420.htm |title=Benign positional vertigo |author=MedlinePlus |year=2011 |work= |publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health |accessdate=2 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125002721/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001420.htm |archivedate=25 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the most common cause of vertigo.&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt; It occurs in 0.6% of the population yearly with 10% having an attack during their lifetime.&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt;  It is believed to be due to a mechanical malfunction of the inner ear.&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt;  BPPV may be diagnosed with the [[Dix-Hallpike test]] and can be effectively treated with repositioning movements such as the [[Epley maneuver]].&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt;&lt;ref name="Benign"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brazil"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alvarenga|first1=GA|last2=Barbosa|first2=MA|last3=Porto|first3=CC|title=Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo without nystagmus: diagnosis and treatment|journal=Brazilian Journal of Otorhinolaryngology|year=2011|volume=77|issue=6|pages=799–804|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1808-86942011000600018&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|pmid=22183288|doi=10.1590/S1808-86942011000600018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627221552/http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1808-86942011000600018&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|archivedate=2013-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://apps.elsevier.es/watermark/ctl_servlet?_f=10&amp;pident_articulo=13153812&amp;pident_usuario=0&amp;pcontactid=&amp;pident_revista=495&amp;ty=150&amp;accion=L&amp;origen=elsevier&amp;web=www.elsevier.es&amp;lan=en&amp;fichero=295v25n05a13153812pdf001_2.pdf|last1=Prim-Espada|first1=MP|last2=De Diego-Sastre|first2=JI|last3=Pérez-Fernández|first3=E|title=[Meta-analysis on the efficacy of Epley's manoeuvre in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo]|journal=Neurologia|volume=25|issue=5|pages=295–299|date=June 2010|pmid=20643039|doi=10.1016/j.nrl.2010.01.004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219194204/http://apps.elsevier.es/watermark/ctl_servlet?_f=10&amp;pident_articulo=13153812&amp;pident_usuario=0&amp;pcontactid=&amp;pident_revista=495&amp;ty=150&amp;accion=L&amp;origen=elsevier&amp;web=www.elsevier.es&amp;lan=en&amp;fichero=295v25n05a13153812pdf001_2.pdf|archivedate=2013-02-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ménière's disease===
[[Ménière's disease]] is an inner ear disorder of unknown origin, but is thought to be caused by an increase in the amount of [[Endolymph|endolymphatic fluid]] present in the inner ear (endolymphatic hydrops).&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt; However, this idea has not been directly confirmed with [[Histopathology|histopathologic]] studies but [[Electrophysiology study|electrophysiologic studies]] have been suggestive of this mechanism.&lt;ref name="relentless"/&gt; Ménière's disease frequently presents with recurrent, spontaneous attacks of severe vertigo in combination with ringing in the ears ([[tinnitus]]), a feeling of pressure or fullness in the ear (aural fullness), severe nausea or vomiting, imbalance, and hearing loss.&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt;&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="relentless"&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Semaan|first1=MT|last2=Megerian|first2=CA|title=Ménière's disease: a challenging and relentless disorder| journal=Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America |volume= 44 |issue=2 |pages=383–403|date=April 2011|pmid=21474013|doi=10.1016/j.otc.2011.01.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the disease worsens, hearing loss will progress.

===Labyrinthitis===
[[Labyrinthitis]] presents with severe vertigo&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt; with associated nausea, vomiting, and generalized imbalance and is believed to be caused by a viral infection of the inner ear though several theories have been put forward and the cause remains uncertain.&lt;ref name=Emerg2009/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neuritis"&gt;{{cite journal|url=| last1=Goddard |first1=JC|last2=Fayad|first2=JN| title=Vestibular Neuritis| journal=Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America |volume=44  |issue=2 |pages=361–365|year=2011 |pmid=21474010|doi=10.1016/j.otc.2011.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with vestibular neuritis do not typically have auditory symptoms but may experience a sensation of aural fullness or tinnitus.&lt;ref name="Neuritis"/&gt; Persisting balance problems may remain in 30% of people affected.&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt;

===Vestibular migraine===
[[Vestibular migraine]] is the association of vertigo and [[migraine]]s and is one of the most common causes of recurrent, spontaneous episodes of vertigo.&lt;ref name=Bre2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt; The cause of vestibular migraines is currently unclear;&lt;ref name=Bre2011/&gt; however, one hypothesized cause is that the stimulation of the [[trigeminal nerve]] leads to [[nystagmus]] in individuals suffering from migraines.&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt; 

Other suggested causes of vestibular migraines include the following: unilateral neuronal instability of the vestibular nerve, idiopathic asymmetric activation of the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem, and [[vasospasm]] of the blood vessels supplying the labyrinth or central vestibular pathways resulting in [[ischemia]] to these structures.&lt;ref name="adolescent"/&gt; Vestibular migraines are estimated to affect 1-3% of the general population&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Epi09/&gt; and may affect 10% of migraine patients.&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt; Additionally, vestibular migraines tend to occur more often in women and rarely affect individuals after the sixth decade of life.&lt;ref name=Bre2011/&gt; 

===Motion sickness===
[[Motion sickness]] is common and is related to vestibular migraine. It is nausea and vomiting in response to motion and is typically worse if the journey is on a winding road or involves lots of stops and starts, or if the person is reading in a moving car. It is caused by a mismatch between visual input and vestibular sensation. For example, the person is reading a book which is stationary in relation to the body but the vestibular system senses that the car, and thus the body, is moving.

===Alternobaric vertigo===
{{main|Alternobaric vertigo}}
Alternobaric vertigo is caused by a pressure difference between the middle ear cavities, usually due to blockage or partial blockage of one eustachian tube, usually when flying or diving underwater. It is most pronounced when the diver is in the vertical position; the spinning is towards the ear with the higher pressure and tends to develop when the pressures differ by 60&amp;nbsp;cm of water or more.&lt;ref name="Powell 2008" &gt;{{cite book  | last = Powell  | first = Mark  | year = 2008  | title = Deco for Divers  | publisher = Aquapress  | location = Southend-on-Sea  | isbn = 978-1-905492-07-7  |page=70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross 1976"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=HE |title=The direction of apparent movement during transient pressure vertigo |journal=Undersea Biomedical Research |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=403–10 |date=December 1976 |pmid=10897867 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2442 |accessdate=2 June 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709042055/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2442 |archivedate=9 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decompression sickness===
{{see|Decompression sickness}}

Vertigo is recorded as a symptom of decompression sickness in 5.3% of cases by the US Navy as reported by Powell, 2008 &lt;ref name=" Powell 2008" /&gt; It including isobaric decompression sickness.

Decompression sickness can also be caused at a constant ambient pressure when switching between gas mixtures containing different proportions of inert gas. This is known as [[isobaric counterdiffusion]], and presents a problem for very deep dives.&lt;ref name="Hamilton &amp; Thalmann" &gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Hamilton  | first1 = Robert W  | last2 = Thalmann  | first2 = Edward D  | author2-link = Edward D. Thalmann  | year = 2003  | chapter = 10.2: Decompression Practice  | editor1-last = Brubakk  | editor1-first = Alf O  | editor2-last = Neuman  | editor2-first = Tom S  | title = Bennett and Elliott's physiology and medicine of diving  | edition = 5th Revised  | publisher = Saunders  | location = United States  | oclc = 51607923  | isbn = 978-0-7020-2571-6 |page=477 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, after using a very helium-rich [[trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]] at the deepest part of the dive, a diver will switch to mixtures containing progressively less helium and more oxygen and nitrogen during the ascent. Nitrogen diffuses into tissues 2.65 times slower than helium, but is about 4.5 times more soluble. Switching between gas mixtures that have very different fractions of nitrogen and helium can result in "fast" tissues (those tissues that have a good blood supply) actually increasing their total inert gas loading. This is often found to provoke inner ear decompression sickness, as the ear seems particularly sensitive to this effect.&lt;ref name="burton2004"&gt;{{cite web | last = Burton | first = Steve | title = Isobaric Counter Diffusion | publisher = ScubaEngineer | date = December 2004 | url = http://www.scubaengineer.com/isobaric_counter_diffusion.htm | accessdate = 10 January 2010 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090310021040/http://www.scubaengineer.com/isobaric_counter_diffusion.htm | archivedate = 10 March 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stroke ===
A stroke (either ischemic or hemorrhagic) involving the [[Posterior cranial fossa|posterior fossa]] is a cause of central vertigo.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Risk factors for a stroke as a cause of vertigo include increasing age and known vascular risk factors.

'''Visual learning''' is  a style in which a learner utilizes graphs, charts, maps and diagrams. It is one of the three basic types of learning styles in the [[Learning styles#Neil Fleming's VAK/VARK model|Fleming VAK/VARK model]] that also includes [[kinesthetic learning]] and [[auditory learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Leite, Walter L.; Svinicki, Marilla; and Shi, Yuying: Attempted Validation of the Scores of the VARK: Learning Styles Inventory With Multitrait–Multimethod Confirmatory Factor Analysis Models, pg. 2. SAGE Publications, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of the brain affected==
Various areas of the [[brain]] work together in a multitude of ways in order to produce the images that we see with our eyes and that are encoded by our brains. The basis of this work takes place in the [[visual cortex]] of the brain. The visual cortex is located in the [[occipital lobe]] of the brain and harbors many other structures that aid in visual recognition, categorization, and learning. One of the first things the brain must do when acquiring new visual information is recognize the incoming material. Brain areas involved in recognition are the [[inferior temporal cortex]], the superior [[parietal cortex]], and the [[cerebellum]].  During tasks of recognition, there is increased activation in the left inferior temporal cortex and decreased activation in the right superior parietal cortex. Recognition is aided by [[neural plasticity]], or the brain's ability to reshape itself based on new information.&lt;ref&gt;Poldrack, R., Desmond, J., Glover, G., &amp; Gabrieli, J. The Neural Basis of Visual Skill Learning: An fMRI Study of Mirror Reading. Cerebral Cortex. Jan/Feb 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Next the brain must categorize the material. The three main areas that are used when categorizing new visual information are the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] and two [[dorsolateral prefrontal]] regions which begin the process of sorting new information into groups and further assimilating that information into things that you might already know.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, R., Sary, G., Dupont, P., Orban, G. Human Brain Regions Involved in Visual Categorization. Elsevier Science (USA) 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; After recognizing and categorizing new material entered into the [[visual field]], the brain is ready to begin the [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]] process – the process which leads to learning. Multiple brain areas are involved in this process such as the [[frontal lobe]], the right [[extrastriate cortex]], the [[neocortex]], and again, the [[neostriatum]]. One area in particular, the [[limbic]]-diencephalic region, is essential for transforming perceptions into memories.&lt;ref&gt;Squire, L. Declarative and Nondeclarative Memory: Multiple Brain Systems Supporting Learning and Memory". 1992 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 4.3.&lt;/ref&gt; With the coming together of tasks of recognition, categorization and learning; [[schema (psychology)|schema]]s help make the process of encoding new information and relating it to things you already know much easier. One can remember visual images much better when they can apply it to an already known schema. Schemas actually provide enhancement of visual memory and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, C. "Schemas and Images as Memory Aids: Two Modes of Processing Social Information". Stanford University. 1980. American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infancy==

===Where it starts===
Between the fetal stage and 18 months, a baby experiences rapid growth of a substance called [[gray matter]]. Gray matter is the darker tissue of the brain and spinal cord, consisting mainly of nerve cell bodies and branching dendrites.&lt;ref&gt;Google definition. (2013, November 12). Retrieved from Google.&lt;/ref&gt; It is responsible for processing sensory information in the brain such as areas like the primary visual cortex. The primary visual cortex is located within the occipital lobe in the back of infant's brain and is responsible for processing visual information such as static or moving objects and pattern recognition.

===The four pathways===
Within the primary visual cortex, there are four pathways: the [[superior colliculus]] pathway (SC pathway), the middle temporal area pathway (MT pathway), the [[frontal eye fields]] pathway (FEF pathway), and the inhibitory pathway. Each pathway is crucial to the development of visual attention in the first few months of life. The SC pathway is responsible for the generation of eye movements toward simple stimuli. It receives information from the retina and the visual cortex and can direct behavior toward an object. The MT pathway is involved in the smooth tracking of objects and travels between the SC pathway and the primary visual cortex. In conjunction with the SC pathway and the MT pathway, the FEF pathway allows the infant to control eye movements as well as visual attention. It also plays a part in sensory processing in the infant. Lastly, the inhibitory pathway regulates the activity in the superior colliculus and, later, is responsible for obligatory attention in the infant. The maturation and functionality of these pathways depends on how well the infant can make distinctions as well as focus on stimuli.

===Supporting studies===
A study by Haith, Hazan, &amp; Goodman in 1988 showed that babies, as young as 3.5 months, are able to create short-term expectations of situations they confront. Expectations in this study refer to the cognitive and perceptual ways in which an infant can forecast a future event. This was tested by showing the infant either a predictable pattern of slides or an irregular pattern of slides and tracking the infant's [[eye movement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Haith, M. M., Hazan, C., &amp; Goodman, G. S. (1988). Expectation and Anticipation of Dynamic Visual Events by 3.5 Month Old Babies. Child Development, 59, 467-479.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A later study by Johnson, Posner, &amp; Rothbart in 1991 showed that by 4 months old, infants can develop expectations, but was tested through anticipatory looks and disengagement with stimuli. For example, anticipatory looks exhibit the infant is able to predict the next part of a pattern which can then be applied to the real world scenario of breast-feeding. Infants are able to predict a mother's movements and expect feeding so they can latch onto the nipple for feeding. Expectations, anticipatory looks, and disengagement all show that infants can learn visually, even if it is only short term.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, M. H., Posner, M. I., &amp; Rothbart, M. K. (1991). Components of Visual Orienting in Early Infancy: Contingency Learning, Anticipatory Looking, and Disengaing. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 335-344&lt;/ref&gt; David Roberts (2016) tested multimedia learning propositions, he found that using certain images dislocates pedagogically harmful excesses of text, reducing cognitive overloading and exploiting under-used visual processing capacities &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dracs.org/|title=David Roberts Academic Consulting|last=|first=|date=|website=vl.catalystitsolutions.co.uk|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In early childhood==
From the ages 3–8 visual learning improves and begins to take many different forms. At the toddler age of 3–5, children's bodily actions structure the visual learning environment. At this age, toddlers are using their newly developed sensory-motor skills quite often and fusing them with their improved vision to understand the world around them. This is seen by toddler's using their arms to bring objects of interest close to their sensors, such as their eyes and face, to explore the object further. The act of bringing objects close to their face affects their immediate view by placing their mental and visual attention on that object and just blocking the view of other objects that are around them and out of view. There is an emphasis placed on objects and things that are directly in front of them and thus proximal vision is the primary perspective of visual learning. This is different from how adults utilize visual learning. This difference in toddler vision and adult vision is attributable to their body sizes, and body movements such that their visual experiences are created by their body movement. An adults view is broad, due to their larger body size, with most objects in view because of the distance between them and objects. Adults tend to scan a room, and see everything rather than focusing on one object only.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, L.B., Yu, C., &amp; Pereira, A. F. (2011). Not your mother's view: The dynamics of toddler visual experience. Developmental science, 14(1), 9-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The way a child integrates visual learning with motor experiences enhances their perceptual and cognitive development.&lt;ref&gt;Bertenthal, B. I., Campos, J. J., &amp; Kermoian, R. (1994). An epigenetic perspective on the development of self-produced locomotion and its consequences. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 3(5), 140-145.&lt;/ref&gt; For elementary school children, aged 4–11, intellect is positively related to their level of auditory-visual integrative proficiency. The most significant period for the development of auditory-visual integration occurs between ages 5–7. During this time, the child has mastered visual-kinesthetic integration, and the child's visual learning can be applied to formal learning focused towards books and reading, rather than physical objects, thus impacting their intellect. As reading scores increase, children are able to learn more, and their visual learning has developed to not only focus on physical objects in close proximity to them, but also to interpret words and such to acquire knowledge by reading.&lt;ref&gt;Birch, H. G., &amp; Belmont, L. (1965). Auditory-visual integration, intelligence and reading ability in school children. Perceptual and Motor Skills, 20(1), 295-305.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In middle childhood==
Here we categorize middle childhood as ages 9 to 14. By this stage in a child's normal development vision is sharp and learning processes are well underway. Most studies that have focused their efforts on visual learning have found that visual learning styles as opposed to traditional learning styles greatly improve the totality of a student's learning experience. First off, visual learning engages students and student engagement is one of the most important factors that motivated students to learn. Visuals increase student interest with the use of graphics animation, and video. Consequently, it has been found that student pay greater attention to lecture material when visuals are used. With increased attention to lesson material, many positive outcomes have been seen with the use of visual tactics in the classrooms of middle aged students. Students organize and process information more thoroughly when they learn visually which helps them to understand the information better. Students are more likely to remember information that is learned with a visual aid.&lt;ref&gt;Beeland, W. "Student Engagement, Visual Learning, and Technology: Can Interactive Whiteboards Help?" (2001). Theses and Dissertations from Valdosta State University Graduate School.&lt;/ref&gt; When teachers used visual tactics to teach middle aged students they found that students had more positive attitudes about the material they were learning.&lt;ref name="Farkas"&gt;Farkas, R. "Effects of Traditional Versus Learning-Styles Instructional Methods on Middle School Students" The Journal of Educational Research. Vol. 97, No. 1 (Sep. - Oct., 2003), pp. 42-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Students also exemplified higher test performance, higher standard achievement scores, thinking on levels that require higher order thinking, and more engagement. One study also found that learning about emotional events, such as the Holocaust, with visual aids increase middle aged children's empathy.&lt;ref name="Farkas"/&gt;

==In adolescence==

===Brain maturation into young adulthood===

Gray matter is responsible for generating [[nerve impulse]]s that process brain information, and [[white matter]] is responsible for transmitting that brain information between lobes and out through the spinal cord. Nerve impulses are transmitted by [[myelin]], a fatty material that grows around a cell. White matter has a myelin sheath (a collection of myelin) while gray matter doesn't, which efficiently allows neural impulses to move swiftly along the fiber. The myelin sheath isn't fully formed until around ages 24–26.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Pat. (2001). Brain Matters: Translating the Research to Classroom Practice. ASCD: 1-207&lt;/ref&gt; This means that adolescents and young adults typically learn differently, and subsequently often utilize [[visual aid]]s in order to help them better comprehend difficult subjects.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Learning preferences can vary across a wide spectrum. Specifically within the realm of visual learning, they can vary between people who prefer being given learning instructions with text as opposed to those who prefer being given instructions with graphics. College students were tested in general factors like learning preference and [[spatial ability]] (being able to be proficient in creating, holding, and manipulating spatial representations).&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R. E., &amp; Massa, L. J. (2003). Three Facets of Visual and Verbal Learners: Cognitive Ability, Cognitive Style, and Learning Preference. Journal of educational psychology, 95(4), 833.&lt;/ref&gt; The study determined that college-age individuals report efficient learning styles and learning preferences for themselves individually. These personal assessments have proved accurate, meaning that self-ratings of factors such as spatial ability and learning preference can be effective measures of how well one learns visually.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Gender differences===

Studies have indicated that adolescents learn best through 10 various styles; reading, manipulative activity, teacher explanation, auditory stimulation, visual demonstration, visual stimulation (electronic), visual stimulation (just pictures), games, social interaction, and personal experience.&lt;ref&gt;Eiszler, C. F. (1982). Perceptual Preferences as an Aspect of Adolescent Learning Styles.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the study, young adult males demonstrate a preference for learning through activities they are able to manipulate, and young adult females show a greater preference for learning through teacher explanation or direction, and through reading. This suggests that men are more visually stimulated, interested in information that they can have physical direct control over. Women, on the other hand, learn best through reading information and having it explained in an auditory fashion.

==Lack of evidence==
Although learning styles have "enormous popularity", and both children and adults express personal preferences, there is no evidence that identifying a student's learning style produces better outcomes, and there is significant evidence that the widely touted "meshing hypothesis" (that a student will learn best if taught in a method deemed appropriate for that student's learning style) is invalid.&lt;ref name=Pashler&gt;{{cite journal

London: Learning and Skills Research Centre.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, recent research by David Roberts at Loughborough university, appearing in peer-reviewed scholarly journals [note here], shows that images used with reduced visible text generates greater subject engagement and higher levels of active learning in large group lecture settings. The visual teaching and learning method, developed from the scholarly research of Professor Richard Mayer, was evaluated over 3 years and across 9 disciplines using control and test group methods complemented by focus groups. The visual pedagogy, and the research testing it, is hosted by the UK Higher Education Academy [note here]

      <comment>"(suitably altered)" was an unnecessary addition. Maybe some women needed to alter the pants, maybe some didn't. The writer does not provide a citation or evidence that women couldn't wear the pants unaltered. It is not a particularly informative addition, and reinforces extraneous assumptions about individual bodies. While the explicit reasons for my edit may appear overly PC, my ultimate point is that this is not useful information and therefore should be removed.</comment>

'''[[Trousers]]''' ([[British English]]) or '''pants''' ([[American English]]) first appear in recorded history among nomadic steppe-people in Western Europe.

However, for much of modern history, the use of trousers has been restricted to men. In many regions, this norm was enforced not only by social custom but also by law. There are, however, many historical cases of women wearing trousers in defiance of these norms, for a variety of reasons, including comfort, freedom of movement, fashion, disguise (notably for runaway [[Slavery_in_the_United_States|slaves]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://co-op.antiochcollege.edu/fashion-crimes-the-rabbit-hole-of-criminalized-cross-dressing-in-us-history/ |title=Fashion Crimes: The Rabbit Hole of Criminalized Cross-Dressing in US History: Mallory Drover ’19 at Boston MFA |website=Antioch Engaged |access-date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), attempts to evade the [[gender pay gap]], and attempts to establish an empowered public identity for women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mattingly |first=Carol |title=Appropriate[ing] Dress: Women's Rhetorical Style in Nineteenth-Century America |publisher=SIU Press |date=2002 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BaynXVfJrxcC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;lpg=PA182}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Especially in the 20th and 21st centuries, the customs and laws restricting this manner of dress have relaxed dramatically, reflecting a growing acceptance and normalization of the practice. 

Various US cities, in the 19th and 20th centuries, passed legislation barring women from wearing trousers. Representative among these was an 1863 law passed by San Francisco's Board of Supervisors criminalizing appearing in public in “a dress not belonging to his or her sex,” although similar laws existed in [[Columbus, Ohio]] (passed 1848); [[Chicago]], Illinois (passed 1851); [[Houston]], Texas (passed 1864); Orlando, Florida (passed 1907), and approximately two dozen other US cities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/arresting-dress |title=Arresting Dress: Duke University Press |website=Duke University Press |access-date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Additionally, existing laws such as anti-vagrancy statutes were pressed into service to ensure that women would dress in accord with the gender norms of the time. One such instance would be New York's anti-vagrancy statute of 1845, which stated that "Every person who, having his face painted, discolored, covered or concealed, or being otherwise disguised, in a manner calculated to prevent him from being identified, shall appear in any road or public highway, or in any field, lot, wood or inclosure, may be pursued and arrested”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fay |first=Joseph |title=Digest of the Laws of the State of New York: Comprising the Revised Statutes and Statutes of General Interest in Force on January 1, 1874, Volume 1 |publisher=James Cockcroft |date=1874 |page=116 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=E8UnAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA116}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This law was used to prosecute women for cross-dressing, on the grounds that their dressing outside of gender norms constituted a "disguise"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://co-op.antiochcollege.edu/fashion-crimes-the-rabbit-hole-of-criminalized-cross-dressing-in-us-history/ |title=Fashion Crimes: The Rabbit Hole of Criminalized Cross-Dressing in US History: Mallory Drover ’19 at Boston MFA |website=Antioch Engaged |access-date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Boston used similar anti-vagrancy laws to arrest [[Emma Snodgrass]] and [[Harriet French]] in 1852. (Snodgrass would be arrested again in Cleveland in 1853, and French would be arrested again in New York in 1856.) French reportedly broke with convention in order to pursue job opportunities open only to men: she claimed to the ''New York Daily Times'' that she could “get more wages” dressed as a man&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/emma-snodgrass-arrested-wearing-pants/ |title=Emma Snodgrass, Arrested for Wearing Pants |website=New England Historical Society |access-date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Anti-vagrancy laws were also used to arrest [[Jennie Westbrook]] in New York, in 1882 and 1883. Westbook's case was said at the time to have "awakened deep interest" among the public, as it was understood that she was attempting to "escape from that bondage [to] which social laws have subjected the sex." Like Harriet French in Boston, West identified work opportunities as her reason for cross-dressing: "Her excuse was that she could make $20 a week in her disguise, while as a 'saleslady' in a fashionable store the pay would be only one-third that amount."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024283/1882-03-09/ed-1/seq-2/ |title=Iron County Register (Ironton, Iron County, Mo.) 1867-1965 |website=Library of Congress: Chronicling America: Historical American Newspapers |access-date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early dress reform==
[[File:Mary edwards walker.jpg|thumb|upright|Mary Edwards Walker, c. 1870. Walker was arrested several times for dressing in male attire.|alt=A black and white image of Mary Walker wearing a suit and standing facing the camera with her right hand tucked into her jacket.]]

In 1851, early women's rights advocate [[Elizabeth Smith Miller]] introduced [[Amelia Bloomer]] to a garment initially known as the "Turkish dress," which featured a knee-length skirt over Turkish-style pantaloons&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/elizabeth-smith-miller.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomer came to advocate and promote the dress, including instructions for making it, in ''[[The_Lily_(newspaper)|The Lily]]'', a newspaper dedicated to the "Emancipation of Woman from Intemperance, Injustice, Prejudice, and Bigotry." This inspired a craze for the dress, which came to be known as [[Bloomers_(clothing)|bloomers]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/amelia-bloomer.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], and [[Lucy Stone]], other early advocates for women's rights, also adopted this style of dress in the 1850s, referring to it as the "freedom dress" {{Citation needed |date=March 2018}}.

Concurrently, some female laborers, notably the [[pit brow women]] working at coal pits in the Wigan area, began wearing trousers beneath a short skirt as a practical component of their uniform. This attracted the attention of the public, and various photographers produced records of the women's unconventional manner of dress through the mid- to late 19th century. 

Another woman who advocated publicly for dress reform was [[Mary Edwards Walker]], the [[Abolitionism_in_the_United_States|abolitionist]] and Civil War surgeon. Walker, who had worn [[Bloomers_(clothing)|bloomers]] while working at a military hospital, wrote in 1871 that women's dress should "protect the person, and allow freedom of motion and circulation, and not make the wearer a slave to it"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Mary Edwards |title=Hit |publisher=The American News Company |date=1871 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Qk4WAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Walker openly wore men's trousers, and was arrested several times for wearing male attire (her earliest arrest was 1866, in New York, and her final arrest was in 1913, in Chicago, at the age of 80&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://co-op.antiochcollege.edu/fashion-crimes-the-rabbit-hole-of-criminalized-cross-dressing-in-us-history/ |title=Fashion Crimes: The Rabbit Hole of Criminalized Cross-Dressing in US History: Mallory Drover ’19 at Boston MFA |website=Antioch Engaged |access-date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Changing norms==

===20th century===
====United States and Europe====
=====1900s-1920s=====

[[Image:MDafoeMay1924Crop.jpg|thumb|Women wearing knickerbockers 1924]]

An updated version of the bloomer, for athletic use, was introduced in the 1890s as women's bicycling came into fashion. As activities such as tennis, cycling, and horseback riding became more popular at the turn of the century, women turned to pants or [[knickerbockers (clothing)|knickerbockers]] to provide comfort and freedom of movement in these activities, and some laws made allowances for women's wearing of pants during these activities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/4363815/history-women-pants-hillary-clinton/ |last=Steinmetz |first=Katy |title=From Horse People to Hillary Clinton: A History of Women Wearing Pants |publisher=Time |accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Women increasingly wore trousers as leisurewear in the 1920s and 30s, and working women, including female pilots, often wore trousers{{Citation needed |date=March 2018}}. 

Arrests for cross-dressing did not necessarily cease during this time. For instance, in 1919, labor leader [[Luisa Capetillo]] became the first woman in [[Puerto Rico]] to wear trousers in public. Capetillo was sent to jail for what was then considered to be a crime in Puerto Rico, although the judge later dropped the charges against her.

=====1930s=====
Actresses [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]] were often photographed in trousers in the 1930s; Dietrich famously appearing in a black [[tuxedo]] and matching fedora at the 1932 premiere of ''[[The_Sign_of_the_Cross_(1932_film)|The Sign of the Cross]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laacollective.org/work/the-audacity-of-pants/ |last=Finamore |first=Michelle |title=The Audacity of Pants |publisher=Los Angeles Archivists Collective |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

[[Eleanor Roosevelt]] became the first [[First Lady]] to appear in pants at a formal function, presiding over the [[Easter Egg Roll]] in 1933 wearing riding pants, a consequence of not having time to change after an early morning ride. However, she seemed to embrace the unconventional circumstance, posing for a photo in the pants on the [[South Portico]] of the White House&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstladies.org/blog/first-ladies-wearing-pants/ |last=Anthony |first=Carl |title=First Ladies Wearing Pants |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' featured its first spread of women wearing slacks in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/4363815/history-women-pants-hillary-clinton/ |last=Steinmetz |first=Katy |title=From Horse People to Hillary Clinton: A History of Women Wearing Pants |publisher=Time |accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====1940s &amp; 1950s=====
During [[World War II]], women working in industrial work in war service wore their husbands' trousers, and in the post-war era trousers were still common casual wear for gardening, socialising, and other leisure pursuits{{Citation needed |date=March 2018}}.

Similarly, in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the [[Second World War]], because of the rationing of clothing, many women took to wearing their husbands' civilian clothes to work while their husbands were away in the armed forces. This was partly because they were seen as work garments, and partly to allow women to keep their clothing allowance for other uses. As the men's clothes wore out, replacements were needed, so that by the summer of 1944 it was reported that sales of women's trousers were five times more than in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;L.W.N. Smith. [http://www.worldwar2exraf.co.uk/Online%20Museum/Museum%20Docs/clothing3.html Clothes Rationing in World War 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, the Government Code Section 12947.5 (part of the [[California Fair Employment and Housing Act]], passed in [[California]]) expressly protected the right to wear pants ([[American English]] for trousers).&lt;ref&gt;[http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/cacode/GOV/1/2/d3/2.8/6/1/s12947.5 California Government Code Section 12947.5].&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the standard FEHA discrimination complaint form now includes an option for "denied the right to wear pants."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/res/docs/RTS/RTS%20Instructions%20and%20Form%20(2-13).pdf Instructions to Obtain Right to Sue Notice by Mail], California Department of Fair Housing and Employment, February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====1960s &amp; 1970s=====
[[File:Yves_St_Laurent_le_smoking_at_deYoung_Museum_San_Francisco.jpg|thumb |border |right |240x240 px |alt=Yves Saint Laurent, Le Smoking, 1966 |Yves Saint Laurent, Le Smoking, 1966]]

In the 1960s, [[André Courrèges]] introduced jeans for women, leading to the era of [[designer clothing|designer jeans]]. And in 1966, [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] introduced ''Le Smoking'', a woman’s tuxedo intended for formal occasions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laacollective.org/work/the-audacity-of-pants/ |last=Finamore |first=Michelle |title=The Audacity of Pants |publisher=Los Angeles Archivists Collective |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, famously photographed by [[Helmut Newton]] in a manner emphasizing the wearer's [[androgyny]] and suggesting [[lesbian]] overtones.

In 1969 Rep. [[Charlotte Reid]] (R-Ill.) became the first woman to wear trousers in the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reliable |first=The |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/post/update-first-woman-to-wear-pants-on-house-floor-rep-charlotte-reid/2011/12/21/gIQAVLD99O_blog.html |title=Update: First woman to wear pants on House floor, Rep.

Also in 1969, [[Barbra Streisand]] became the first woman to attend the Oscars in pants, accepting an award for her role in ''[[Funny_Girl_(film)|Funny Girl]]'' dressed in an outfit designed by [[Arnold Scaasi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laacollective.org/work/the-audacity-of-pants/ |last=Finamore |first=Michelle |title=The Audacity of Pants |publisher=Los Angeles Archivists Collective |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 1972, [[Pat Nixon]] was the first American [[First Lady]] to model pants in a national magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carlanthonyonline.com/2012/03/16/the-first-lady-a-nation-never-knew-pat-nixon-in-private-taped-phone-calls-100-pictures-on-her-centennial/ |title=The First Lady a Nation Never Knew: Pat Nixon in Private Taped Phone Calls &amp; 100 Pictures on Her Centennial |publisher=Carl Anthony Online |date=March 16, 2012 |accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[First Lady|First Ladies]] had been seen earlier wearing pants, including [[Lou Hoover]] (photographed privately wearing riding pants at the presidential retreat [[Camp Rapidan]]) and [[Jackie Kennedy]] (photographed wearing pants and a sweater on Cape Cod in 1960 and wearing [[palazzo pants]] in Italy in 1962)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstladies.org/blog/first-ladies-wearing-pants/ |last=Anthony |first=Carl |title=First Ladies Wearing Pants |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 1972, the [[Education Amendments of 1972]] passed in the United States, which, as part of the [[Title IX]] non-discrimination provisions, declared that dresses could not be required of girls. Dress codes thus changed in public schools across the United States.

In the 1970s, trousers became quite fashionable for women. [[Jane Fonda]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Tatum O’Neal]], and [[Diane Keaton]] all helped to popularize the wearing of pants, appearing at high-profile awards ceremonies dressed in suits or pants ensembles; Tatum O'Neal notably accepted an Oscar at age 10 while wearing a tuxedo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laacollective.org/work/the-audacity-of-pants/ |last=Finamore |first=Michelle |title=The Audacity of Pants |publisher=Los Angeles Archivists Collective |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=====1980s &amp; 1990s=====
In 1989 California state senator [[Rebecca Morgan]] became the first woman to wear trousers in a U.S. state senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&amp;dat=19890207&amp;id=m5ozAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lTIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7060,4772564|title=Lodi News-Sentinel - Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hillary Clinton]] was the first woman to wear trousers in an official U.S. First Lady portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Betsi Fores |url=http://rare.us/story/flashback-top-7-hillary-rodham-clinton-pant-suits/ |title=Flashback: Top 7 Hillary Rodham Clinton pant suits &amp;#124; Rare |publisher=Rare.us |date=2013-06-19 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, [[Malawi]] women became legally allowed to wear trousers under President [[Kamuzu Banda]]'s rule.&lt;ref name="Malawi in Pictures"&gt;Sarah DeCapua, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZQuk3icokBQC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=Malawian+women+wearing+pants&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rBFZgDz7p8&amp;sig=jQe_Bx9Tetqv-h0LK0WozfetGeU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-2I4TfelLYbVgAem8r26CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Malawian%20women%20wearing%20pants&amp;f=false ''Malawi in Pictures''], 2009, pg 7.&lt;/ref&gt;, originally prohibited by a law introduced in 1965.&lt;ref name="152.111.1.88"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://152.111.1.88/argief/berigte/beeld/1993/12/1/9/7.html |title=Beeld JOHANNESBURG FINAAL Woensdag 1 Desember 1993 Bl. 9: Malawi-vroue mag broek dra |publisher=152.111.1.88 |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
====International norms====

Since 2004 the [[International Skating Union]] has allowed women to wear trousers instead of skirts in competition if they wish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skatetoday.com/2004/12/05/slovak-pair-tests-new-isu-costume-rules/|title=Slovak Pair Tests New ISU Costume Rules - Skate Today|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a bylaw requiring women in Paris, France to ask permission from city authorities before "dressing as men", including wearing trousers (with exceptions for those "holding a bicycle handlebar or the reins of a horse") was declared officially revoked by France's Women's Rights Minister, [[Najat Vallaud-Belkacem]].&lt;ref name="newsfeed.time.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/02/04/it-is-now-legal-for-women-to-wear-pants-in-paris/#ixzz2kp0hXoqW |title=It Is Now Legal for Women to Wear Pants in Paris| work=Time | date=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bylaw was originally intended to prevent women from wearing the pantalons fashionable with Parisian rebels in the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="newsfeed.time.com"/&gt;

In 2014, an Indian family court in [[Mumbai]] ruled that a husband objecting to his wife wearing a [[kurta]] and [[jeans]] and forcing her to wear a [[sari]] amounts to cruelty inflicted by the husband and can be a grounds for divorce.&lt;ref name="gulfnews1"&gt;{{cite web|author=PTI |url=http://gulfnews.com/news/asia/india/wife-s-jeans-ban-is-grounds-for-divorce-india-court-rules-1.1353273 |title=Wife's jeans ban is grounds for divorce, India court rules |publisher=GulfNews.com |date=2014-06-28 |accessdate=2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wife was thus granted a divorce on the ground of cruelty as defined under section 27(1)(d) of Special Marriage Act, 1954.&lt;ref name="gulfnews1"/&gt;

In 2017, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] announced that its female employees could wear "professional pantsuits and dress slacks" while at work; dresses and skirts had previously been required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimdalrympleii/the-mormon-church-just-allowed-female-employees-to-wear |title=The Mormon Church Just Allowed Female Employees To Wear Pants.

====School norms====
Most UK schools allow female pupils to wear trousers, but many girls still wear skirts in primary and secondary schools, even where the choice of trousers is given.  In the late 20th and early 21st century, many schools began changing their uniform rules to allow trousers for girls amidst opposition to skirts-only policies - the most publicised possibly being Jo Hale vs Whickam Comprehensive in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rebecca Smithers Education Correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2000/feb/24/schools.news |title=Girl wins battle to wear trousers to school &amp;#124; Education |publisher=The Guardian |date=2000-02-24 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although commonly accepted that girls may wear trousers to school, no test case is known to have been brought before the courts, making the legal position uncertain on requiring skirts as part of girls' uniforms.  The rule is still enforced in many schools, particularly independent and selective state schools.  In fact, government guidelines expressly state the decision of allowing girls to wear trousers is with individual schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/school-uniform |title=School uniform |publisher=GOV.UK |date=2014-06-27 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remaining prohibitions==

===Religious prohibitions===
There are a number of [[religion]]s that prohibit women from revealing their legs, requiring all women and often young girls not to wear trousers but a long dress{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}. By contrast, a sizable majority of [[Sikhs]] often believe wearing trousers is preferred for Sikh women to maintain modesty.

Although many contemporary [[Mennonites]] have no dress code, among traditional, conservative Mennonites, sometimes referred to as "Old Order Mennonites", long skirts or dresses covering most of the legs are required. They also wear dresses and skirts because they believe men and women should be distinguished from one another. "Deuteronomy 22:5
The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God." (KJV)  Conservative conferences usually demand that women wear a specific style of dress. This is usually in the style of the cape dress, with a double covering or "cape". Most non-conservative conferences allow for the wearing of trousers by women.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

[[Pentecostal]] women typically wear skirts because of the Biblical commandment in the Old Testament that women must not wear men's clothing; this is mandatory in some oneness Pentecostal churches (at the individual pastor's discretion).{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Many [[Independent Fundamental Baptist]] churches, colleges and universities prohibit females from wearing trousers. For example, at [[Pensacola Christian College]], female students may only wear trousers or shorts for "recreational purposes" only. They are also required to wear skirts or dresses until 5:00 PM on workdays&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcci.edu/pathway/StudentResponsibilities/CollegeStandards.aspx|title=College Standards · Student Responsibilities · Pathway · Pensacola Christian College|website=www.pcci.edu|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In Orthodox Jewish belief, the space between a woman's legs is considered to be a private area, and therefore, must be covered by a garment{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}. However, in other cultures wearing men's clothing is forbidden biblically under the prohibition of ''Lo Silbash'' ("A woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man", {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:5|HE}}). In some [[Jewish ethnicities|Jewish communities]], such as the Jews from Arab countries and [[Modern Orthodox]] communities, it is reasoned that trousers provide an extra form of modesty.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

On 13 November 866, [[Pope Nicholas I]] wrote to King [[Boris I of Bulgaria]]: "Whether you or your women wear or do not wear trousers neither impedes your salvation nor leads to any increase of your virtue"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravoslavieto.com/history/09/866_responce_pope_Nicholas_I.htm#gen52 The Responses of Pope Nicholas I to the Questions of the Bulgars A.D. 866 (Letter 99)], translated by W.

North (1998) from the edition of Ernest Perels, in MGH Epistolae VI, Berlin, 1925, pp.568-600.&lt;/ref&gt; (''sive vos, sive feminae vestrae, sive deponatis, sive induatis femoralia, nec saluti officit, nec ad virtutum vestrarum proficit incrementum'' - [[Patrologia Latina]], CXIX, 1002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rorate-caeli.blogspot.com/search?q=femoralia|title=RORATE CÆLI: Search results for femoralia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the [[Society of Saint Pius X]] have spoken of the preference of women's wearing skirts rather than trousers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sspx.ca/Documents/Bishop-Williamson/September1-1991.htm Letter on trousers]&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal Siri's letter has also been cited as justification for women wearing skirts and dresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olrl.org/virtues/pants.shtml|title=Notification Concerning Men's Dress Worn By Women|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]], the Church's principal theologian, also taught that "outward apparel should be consistent with the estate of the person, according to the general custom. Hence it is in itself sinful for a woman to wear man's clothes, or vice versa; and it is expressly forbidden in the Law (Deuteronomy 22)..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3169.htm|title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: Modesty in the outward apparel (Secunda Secundae Partis, Q. 169)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 and 2013, some [[Mormon]] women participated in "Wear Pants to Church Day", in which they wore trousers to church instead of the customary dresses to encourage gender equality within [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.christianpost.com/news/mormon-women-observe-wear-pants-to-church-sunday-to-promote-gender-equality-110882/ |title=Mormon Women Observe 'Wear Pants to Church' Sunday to Promote Gender Equality |date=16 December 2013 |author= Gryboski, Michael |work=Christian Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.boiseweekly.com/CityDesk/archives/2013/12/14/lds-women-suit-up-for-second-wear-pants-to-church-day |date=14 December 2013 |author= Seid, Natalie |title=LDS Women Suit Up For Second 'Wear Pants to Church Day' |work=Boise Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over one thousand women participated in this in 2012.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; 

===Dancing===
Many forms of dancing require females to wear skirts or dresses, either by convention or competition rules.  In [[Scottish highland dancing]] for example, women don't wear [[trews]], but instead either wear a skirt or dress including the [[Aboyne dress]] (for the national dances) or the kilt-based outfit for the Highland dances. However, tartan trews can be worn by women in the [[United States]].

===Sudan===
In [[Sudan]], Article 152 of the Memorandum to the 1991 Penal Code prohibits the wearing of "obscene outfits" in public. This law has been used to arrest and prosecute women wearing trousers. Thirteen women including journalist [[Lubna al-Hussein]] were arrested in Khartoum in July 2009 for wearing trousers; ten of the women pleaded guilty and were flogged with ten lashes and fined 250 Sudanese pounds apiece. Lubna al-Hussein considers herself a good Muslim and asserts "Islam does not say whether a woman can wear trousers or not. I'm not afraid of being flogged. It doesn't hurt. But it is insulting." She was eventually found guilty and fined the equivalent of $200 rather than being flogged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/08/world/africa/08sudan.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first1=Jeffrey | last1=Gettleman | first2=Waleed | last2=Arafat | title=Sudan Court Fines Woman for Wearing Trousers | date=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trousers and sexual violence==
In [[Rome]] in 1992, a 45-year-old driving instructor was accused of rape. When he picked up an 18-year-old girl for her first driving lesson, he allegedly raped her for an hour, then told her that if she was to tell anyone he would kill her. Later that night she told her parents and her parents agreed to help her press charges. While the alleged rapist was convicted and sentenced, the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Italian Supreme Court]] overturned the conviction in 1998 because the victim wore tight jeans. It was argued that she must have necessarily have had to help her attacker remove her jeans, thus making the act [[consensual]] ("because the victim wore very, very tight jeans, she had to help him remove them...and by removing the jeans...it was no longer rape but consensual sex").  The Italian Supreme Court stated in its decision “it is a fact of common experience that it is nearly impossible to slip off tight jeans even partly without the active collaboration of the person who is wearing them.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faedi|first=Benedetta|title=Rape, Blue Jeans, and Judicial Developments in Italy|journal=Columbia Journal of European Law|year=2009|archiveurl=https://archive.is/HkiS|archivedate=2012-07-24|url=http://www.cjel.net/online/16_1-faedi/|accessdate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling sparked widespread feminist protest. The day after the decision, women in the Italian Parliament protested by wearing jeans and holding placards that read “Jeans: An Alibi for Rape.” As a sign of support, the California Senate and Assembly followed suit. Soon Patricia Giggans, Executive Director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women, (now Peace Over Violence) made [[Denim Day]] an annual event. As of 2011 at least 20 U.S. states officially recognize Denim Day in April. Wearing jeans on this day has become an international symbol of protest against erroneous and destructive attitudes about sexual assault. As of 2008 the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Italian Supreme Court]] has overturned their findings, and there is no longer a "denim" defense to the charge of rape.
