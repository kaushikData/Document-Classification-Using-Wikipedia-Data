The '''2014 Sweden mosques arson attacks''' were a series of [[arson]] attacks on three [[mosque]]s in [[Sweden]] that took place during one week at the end of 2014.&lt;ref name="financial times"/&gt; In addition to being struck by [[Molotov cocktails]], some mosques were vandalized with racist graffiti.&lt;ref name="financial times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/63382ebe-91c8-11e4-bfe8-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3NjJghbbS|title=Sweden hit by third assault on mosque|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/news/world/Europe/story/Sweden-hit-third-mosque-arson-attack-week-20150102|title=Sweden hit by third mosque arson attack in a week|publisher=straitstimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first incident, the only to have caused injuries, was however later found by police investigations to have been an accident in the mosque kitchen caused by an overheated deep-fryer.&lt;ref name="sverigesradio"&gt;{{cite news|title=Source: Police "no longer suspect arson" at Eskilstuna mosque|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=6060191|accessdate=22 April 2015|publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]]|date=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sverigesradio2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Local newspaper: Eskilstuna mosque fire caused by deep-fryer|url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=6112343|publisher=Sveriges Radio|date=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thelocal"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Report deep fryer started mosque fire|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20150309/deep-fryer-sparked-mosque-fire-report|work=[[The Local]]|date=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks==
On Christmas, five people suffered injuries when, according to early reports, a petrol bomb had been tossed through the window of a mosque in [[Eskilstuna]]. Up to 20 people, including children, were in the mosque at the time of the attack.&lt;ref name=Euronews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2014/12/26/arson-attack-at-swedish-mosque-leaves-five-injured/|title=Arson attack at Swedish mosque leaves five injured|work=euronews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Local&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20141226/five-hurt-in-mosque-arson-attack|title=Five hurt in mosque arson attack|publisher=thelocal.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police later said they were investigating the incident as an accident, considering it unlikely to have been a deliberate attack.&lt;ref name="sverigesradio"/&gt; It was later reported that an overheated deep-fryer was the probable cause of the fire.&lt;ref name="sverigesradio2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thelocal"/&gt;

The second attack took place on Monday in the southern Swedish town of [[Eslöv]] just after 3 am local time. No one was injured on that occasion.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/29/sweden-arson-mosque-fires-islamophobia|title=Swedish mosque set ablaze in second suspected arson attack in a week|author=David Crouch|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Newsweek&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/sweden-right-wing-arson-attack-mosque-295487|title=Second Swedish Mosque Targeted in Suspected Arson Attack|work=newsweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on New Year’s morning, a third attack hit a mosque in [[Uppsala]].&lt;ref name=Local2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20150101/uppsala-mosque-hit-by-firebomb-attack|title=Uppsala mosque hit in third firebomb attack|publisher=thelocal.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/Sweden-hit-by-third-mosque-arson-attack-20150102-12gppx.html|title=Sweden hit by third mosque arson attack|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/world/Europe/Sweden-suffers-third-mosque-arson-attack-in-a-week|title=Sweden suffers third mosque arson attack in a week|publisher=The National}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The attacks happened at a time of rising anti-immigrant sentiment and political tension over Sweden's status as the leading destination in the European Union (per capita) for asylum seekers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/Europe/swedes-rally-in-support-of-mosques-after-arson-attacks/2015/01/02/d3146c48-92c7-11e4-a66f-0ca5037a597d_story.html|title=Swedes rally in support of mosques after arson attacks|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response ==
Prime Minister [[Stefan Löfven]] said that the attacks were "hateful violence" and denounced the crime. He said that the attacks were not representative of Sweden. and that "no-one in Sweden should be afraid of practicing their religion".

Samir Muric, the imam in [[Eslöv]], told a Swedish news agency: "Unfortunately this is probably something to do with Islamophobia. I live nearby, and it’s beginning to feel unsafe."

On January 2, 2015, hundreds of anti-racist demonstrators in three major Swedish cities rallied in support of Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/swedes-rally-support-mosques-arson-attacks-27968115|title=Swedes Rally in Support of Mosques After Arson Attacks|author=ABC News|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/01/02/swedes-rally-in-support-muslims-after-arson-attacks-against-mosques/|title=Swedes rally in support of Muslims after arson attacks against mosques|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arabs in Romania''' ({{lang-ro|Arabii din România}}) are the people from [[Arab countries]], particularly [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], Palestine, [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]] and also small groups from [[Egypt]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]], [[Libya]] and [[Sudan]], who emigrated from their native nations and currently reside in Romania. Most Arab Romanians are of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] or Syrian origin. In the forty-year history of this community, 5,000 Arabs have migrated to Romania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-arhiva-1228220-500-arabi-din-romania-cercetati-pentru-infractiuni-economice.htm 500 de arabi din Romania, cercetati pentru infractiuni economice - Arhiva noiembrie 2007 - HotNews.ro&lt;!-- Titlu generat de un robot --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adevarul.ro/articole/2005/orientul-mijlociu-de-langa-noi-arabii-din-romania-dincolo-de-sabloane.html Orientul Mijlociu de langa noi: arabii din Romania, dincolo de sabloane&lt;!-- Titlu generat de un robot --&gt;]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that almost half a million [[Middle East]]ern Arabs studied in Romania during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evz.ro/article.php?artid=185041 |title=Evenimentul Zilei |publisher=Evz.ro |date= |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Romania has people from Arab countries, who have the status of refugees ([[Refugees of the Syrian civil war]]) or illegal immigrants, primarily from North Africa, trying to immigrate to Western Europe.

'''The Assets Examination Committee''' ([[Thai language|Thai:]] คณะกรรมการตรวจสอบการกระทำที่ก่อให้เกิดความเสียหายแก่รัฐ; [[Royal Thai General System of Transcription|RTGS:]] ''Khana Kammakan Truat Sop Kan Kratham Thi Ko Hai Koet Khwam Sia Hai Kae Rat'', Literal Meaning: the Committee for Inspection of Acts being Detrimental to the State), abbreviated as '''AEC''' ([[Thai language|Thai:]] คตส., [[Royal Thai General System of Transcription|RTGS:]] khotoso),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=คตส.  khotoso|url=http://www.thai-language.com/id/152366|website=thai-language.com|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes translated as the '''Assets Scrutiny Committee''' or '''ASC''', is a now-defunct [[Thailand|Thai]] [[Governmental agency|administrative body]] in charge of [[scrutiny]] of assets of the ministers in the government of [[Thaksin Shinawatra|Pol Lt Col Thaksin Shinawatra]]. The [[Council for National Security]], a military [[Military dictatorship|junta]] that overthrew Thaksin's government in 2006, accused those ministers of having gained assets in a manner against the law or detrimental to the state. They set up the AEC in response.&lt;ref name=CDRAnc30&gt;{{cite web|title=Announcements of the Council for Democratic Reform (Thailand); Inspection of Acts being Detrimental to the State - Announcement of the Council for Democratic Reform No. 30 - [2006] THCDR 30 (30 September 2006)|url=http://www.asianlii.org/th/other/THCDR/2006/30.html|website=Asian LII|accessdate=9 July 2015|date=2006-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They mainly live in the east of the country, in the province of [[Overijssel]], in such cities as [[Enschede]], [[Hengelo]], [[Almelo]] and [[Borne, Overijssel|Borne]]. The main reason that the Assyrians are concentrated there is because it is an industrial area which lies at the border with [[Germany]], where a large German Assyrian population resides (many Assyrians in the Netherlands have relatives in Germany.)

==History==
[[File:Assyriansinholland2.jpg|thumb|250px|Assyrians in the Netherlands protesting for the recognition of the [[Assyrian genocide]]]]
The first Assyrians came to the Netherlands in the 1970s; most of them were from [[Turkey]]. In the 1980s, Assyrians from [[Syria]] began to emigrate to the Netherlands. The latest group of Assyrians immigrants come from [[Iraq]], and have been arriving since the first [[Gulf War]].

In the 1980s, as with other immigrants in Europe, a strong feeling of nationalism started to develop among the Assyrians in the Netherlands. This sentiment started to make Assyrians be active in working for projects that helped them preserve their identity. A few projects that started out were Assyrians society building, Assyrians churches and Assyrians language classes, which were being given in Dutch schools to Assyrian children and also on weekends in so-called Bible school classes. They also started camps for Assyrians youth, Assyrian music and dance classes were offered in the community, lectures to adult Assyrians on society building and lots of social events were organized for the Assyrian community. Since 1981 there is a [[Syriac Orthodox]] monastery in the village [[Glane, Overijssel|Glane]] near the German border. 

The Assyrians began to organize demonstrations to bring their situation in the [[Assyrian homeland]] to the attention of the media and to bring the 20th century [[Assyrian genocide]] to the attention of the Dutch government.

==Current situation==
The Assyrians have managed to both integrate into Dutch society and maintain their own ethnic identity, as there are a lot of social events organized by Assyrian clubs. Some of the latest projects which Assyrians in the Netherlands have started are: the Seyfo Center, the Assyrian Church Choir, representation of Assyrians in the Dutch government (such as [[Attiya Gamri]]), and the foundation of the Assyrian Youth Movement (AJF).

Assyrians in the Netherlands mostly belong to [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], but there is also a small community belonging to the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] and [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. The first Assyrians mainly worked in factories or opened restaurants, but today, mostly attend university and work in all sectors of the economy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3545">The '''Interdepartmental Committee on Drug Addiction''', commonly called the ''' Brain Committee''' after its chairman Sir [[Russell Brain]], was created by the [[Home Office]] in 1958 to consider issues related to drugs and drug addiction in the United Kingdom. The committee explored whether or not certain drugs should be considered addictive or habit-forming; examined whether there was a medical need to provide special, including institutional, treatment outside the resources already available, for persons addicted to drugs; and made recommendations, including proposals for administrative measures, to the [[Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing|Minister of Health]] and the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]].

The committee produced two reports.

== The First Brain Report ==
The first report is also known as '''The Report of the Second Inter-departmental Committee on Drug Addiction''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.release.org.uk/drugs-law/drugs-through-time/1940-2008 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707234533/http://www.release.org.uk/drugs-law/drugs-through-time/1940-2008 |archivedate=2010-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was published in 1961.  It stated that the incidence of addiction to dangerous drugs in Great Britain was small.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drugtext.org/First-Brain-Report/drug-addiction-1.html&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the same conclusion drawn by the previous committee, The [[Rolleston Committee]], in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drugtext.org/Table/Rolleston-Report/&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Second Brain Report ==
The second report was published in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-shipman-inquiry.org.uk/4r_page.asp?id=3114&lt;/ref&gt;  This report showed that there had been a significant rise in the incidence of addiction to [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]], that the main source of supply was a small number of over-prescribing doctors.  The Rolleston defined addiction as an individualised pathology, whilst the second Brain report explicitly described the condition as a socially infectious one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugtext.org/Addiction/changing-images-of-the-addict-and-addiction.html by Rachel Lart, CHANGING IMAGES OF THE ADDICT AND ADDICTION, BRITISH MEDICAL PERCEPTION FROM ROLLESTON TO BRAIN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016232133/http://www.drugtext.org/Addiction/changing-images-of-the-addict-and-addiction.html |date=2012-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It recommended the establishment of special treatment centres, especially in the London area, where addicts could be isolated from the community and treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drugtext.org/Second-Brain-Report/drug-addiction-2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927050525/http://www.drugtext.org/Second-Brain-Report/drug-addiction-2.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These became known as Drug Dependency Units, or DDUs.

== Evolution ==
A recommendation of the second committee was to set up a Standing Advisory Committee to keep under review the whole problem of drug dependence. This drew on evidence provided  by doctors and eventually they produced a report, the [[Wootton Report]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drugtext.org/The-Strange-Case-of-Pot/7-the-wootton-report.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British [[Dragon Boat]] Racing Association''' ('''BDA''') is the UK governing body for [[dragon boat]] racing as a sport and recreation, recognised by the UK [[Sports Council]].

The BDA controls the sport through its Executive Committee and Council.

The BDA Executive Committee is responsible for the policy, organisation and administration of the sport, at UK level, and for the selection of British crews competing abroad.

As a National Governing Body, the BDA is a member of both the [[International Dragon Boat Federation]] ([[IDBF]]) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idbf.org/ International Dragon Boat Federation]&lt;/ref&gt; and the European Dragon Boat Federation (EDBF).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edbf.org/ European Dragon Boat Federation]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Dragon Boat]] Racing first featured competitively in the UK in September 1980 at the Hong Kong in London Chinese Festival. Races held on the River Thames were won by the Richmond Canoe Club in both the Men's and Women's classes. In 1981 racing featured in the World Canoe and Kayak Racing Championships, held at the National Water Sports Centre, Nottingham. The Lincoln Imps crew won this 500-metre event.

The formation of the DBRC (Dragon Boat Racing Club of Great Britain) in June 1985, was the first serious attempt to organise the sport on a national scale in the British Isles. With the three Hong Kong wooden boats imported for the London Festival in 1980, the DBRC raced fairly regularly during 1986/87, and with the support of the [[HKTA]], built the first fibre-glass dragon boat in the country.

After making its debut on the BBC TV's 'Blue Peter' programme, in May 1986 a dragon boat was raced from London to Nottingham via the canal system by a crew of soldiers in aid of charity. The crew paddled 180 miles (including 180 portages for canal locks) in 9 days and raised over £4,000 for Sport Aid en route. In 1986 and early 1987 specialist dragon boat groups were formed in Sheffield, Liverpool and Tyneside (although none of them had dragon boats, at this stage).

In July 1987, following an initiative by the DBRC, these groups came together to form the British Dragon Boat Racing Association – the BDA, which was formally constituted as the governing body for the sport of Dragon Boat Racing in the UK at an inaugural meeting held at the National Water Sports Centre, Nottingham.

The 1st National Championships were held in October 1987 on the Serpentine Lake in London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], where 19 crews contested the 500m races. Elmbridge Kayak Club were the first BDA National Champions over this distance. During 1988 the sport expanded rapidly when over 20 events were held in the UK and the BDA was recognised by the Central Council for Physical Recreation (CCPR) as the sport's governing body and admitted into its membership.

The sport of Dragon Boat Racing was recognised by the Sports Council in 1992 and the BDA as its Governing Body received recognition in 1994.

Lord [[Sebastian Coe]] is the current Patron of the BDA.

There are currently over 28 member teams in the BDA National League, these are split into the Standard League and the Premier League [http://www.dragonboat.org.uk]

'''The College Club of Seattle''' is a [[gentlemen's club|private club]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] that was founded in 1910. As of 2016, the club has evolved into a rowing and water sport club on Lake Union and has 200 members.

==History==
The club was founded in 1910 by five [[Yale University|Yale]] graduates (Thomas Babcock, Ralph Angell, St. Clair Dickinson, Bob Forbes and Bob Chase) and one graduate from the [[University of Wisconsin]]. After signing up 50 members and choosing a president by the name of Charles P. Spooner, a [[Princeton University|Princeton]] graduate with a law degree from Wisconsin and on the [[University of Washington]] [[Board of Regents]], the club moved into a rented suite of rooms on the second floor of the old federal court building on the corner of Fourth Ave. and Marion Street. With a growing membership, the club outgrew this space in 1912 and hired the Metropolitan Building Company to build them a new home on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Seneca Streets, which they shared with the [[University Club of Seattle|Women's University Club]] until 1921. Once again, the College Club outgrew their space and a new building was erected on Sixth Avenue and Spring Street. This building served as the club's home until 1962 when plans for the new [[Interstate 5|I-5 freeway]] called for its removal. The club had previously purchased a lot at 505 Madison Street for $100,000 in 1954 and a new building was erected there. This would serve as the club's longest home until it was sold to a developer in 2007 and the club moved temporarily into the Columbia Tower Club through 2013. In 2013, the club purchased two houseboats on the NE shores of Seattle's [[Lake Union]] where it currently operates as a private [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[kayaking]], [[paddleboarding]], and [[swimming]] club.

==Modern Day==
Although founded as a private men's club in downtown Seattle, the changing demographics of in-city clubs resulted in a significant decrease in the club's membership roster from a high of 1,200 in 1990 to just under 200 today. As a result, the club abandoned the traditional private club model and has since moved onto two houseboats on the NE shores of Lake Union where it currently operates as a private rowing, kayaking, paddleboarding and swimming club. The two houseboats are called the [[Motor ship|M/V]] Unity and the M/V Inspiration. The Unity, the smaller of the two vessels and the one closer to land, contains three floors, each measuring 70' by 32' (6,720 total sq. ft.) The Inspiration has two floors measuring 54' by 70' and a third-floor, two-bedroom caretaker's apartment measuring 15' by 31' (8,025 total sq. ft.) Together, the two boats contain 14,745 sq. ft. of space.

A '''cooperative''' (also known as '''co-operative''', '''co-op''', or '''coop''') is "an [[autonomy|autonomous]] association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and [[democracy|democratically]]-controlled [[wiktionary:Enterprise|enterprise]]".&lt;ref name="ica-principles"&gt;[http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles.html Statement on the Cooperative Identity.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204081503/http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles.html |date=4 February 2012 }} ''[[International Cooperative Alliance]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperatives may include:

* [[business]]es owned and managed by the people who use their services (a [[consumer cooperative]])
* organizations managed by the people who work there ([[worker cooperative]]s)
* multi-stakeholder or hybrid cooperatives that share ownership between different stakeholder groups. For example, care cooperatives where ownership is shared between both care-givers and receivers. Stakeholders might also include non-profits or investors.
* second- and third-tier cooperatives whose members are other cooperatives
* [[platform cooperative | platform cooperatives]] that use a cooperatively owned and governed website, mobile app or a protocol to facilitate the sale of goods and services.

Research published by the [[Worldwatch Institute]] found that in 2012 approximately one billion people in 96 countries had become members of at least one cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.worldwatch.org/membership-co-operative-businesses-reaches-1-billion |title= Membership in Co-operative Businesses Reaches 1 Billion  - Worldwatch Institute|publisher= | quote= Membership in co-operative businesses has grown to 1 billion people across 96 countries, according to new research published by the Worldwatch Institute for its Vital Signs Online publication.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The turnover of the largest three hundred cooperatives in the world reached $2.2 [[trillion (short scale)|trillion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://monitor.coop/|title= The World Co-operative Monitor|work= monitor.coop}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Cooperative businesses are typically more economically [[Resilience (organizational) | resilient]] than many other forms of enterprise, with twice the number of co-operatives (80%) surviving their first five years compared with other business [[ownership]] models (41%).&lt;ref name="uk.coop"&gt;http://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/uploads/attachments/co-op_economy_2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperatives frequently have social goals which they aim to accomplish by investing a proportion of trading profits back into their communities. As an example of this, in 2013, [[retail co-operative]]s in the [[UK]] invested 6.9% of their pre-tax profits in the communities in which they trade as compared with 2.4% for other rival [[supermarkets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thenews.coop/93737/news/general/community-investment-index-giving-back-to-neighbourhoods/ |title= Community investment index: giving back to neighbourhoods |work= thenews.coop |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150626103146/http://www.thenews.coop/93737/news/general/community-investment-index-giving-back-to-neighbourhoods/ |archivedate= 26 June 2015 |df= dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since 2002 cooperatives and credit unions could be distinguished on the Internet by use of a [[.coop]] domain. Since 2014, following International Cooperative Alliance's introduction of the Cooperative Marque, [[International Cooperative Alliance|ICA]] cooperatives and [[World Council of Credit Unions|WOCCU]] credit unions can also be identified by a coop [[ethical consumerism]] label.

==Origins and history==
{{Main article|History of the cooperative movement}}
Cooperation dates back as far as human beings have been organizing for mutual benefits. Tribes were organized as cooperative structures, allocating jobs and resources among each other, only trading with the external communities.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In alpine environments, trade could only be maintained in organized cooperatives to achieve a useful condition of artificial roads such as [[Viamala]] in 1472.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hohenraetien.ch/HR-Web-2008/web-content/HR-08-Materialien/Viamala_Brief_vollstText.pdf |title=1473 letter of intent to build a road, in (old) german |format=PDF |date= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706234019/http://www.hohenraetien.ch/HR-Web-2008/web-content/HR-08-Materialien/Viamala_Brief_vollstText.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-industrial Europe is home to the first cooperatives from an industrial context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Europe|first=CICOPA|title=About Us|url=http://www.cecop.coop/What-is-CECOP}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The roots of the cooperative movement can be traced to multiple influences and extend worldwide. In the [[English-speaking world]], post-[[feudal]] forms of cooperation between workers and owners that are expressed today as "profit-sharing" and "surplus sharing" arrangements, existed as far back as 1795.&lt;ref&gt;Gates, J. (1998) ''The Ownership Solution'', London: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;  The key ideological influence on the Anglosphere branch of the cooperative movement, however, was a ''rejection'' of the [[charity (practice)|charity]] principles that underpinned [[welfare]] reforms when the [[British government]] radically revised its [[Poor Laws]] in 1834. As both state and church institutions began to routinely distinguish between the 'deserving' and 'undeserving' poor, a movement of friendly societies grew throughout the [[British Empire]] based on the principle of mutuality, committed to self-help in the welfare of working people.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

[[File:Portrait of Robert Owen (1771 - 1858) by John Cranch, 1845.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Owen]] (1771–1858) was a social reformer and a pioneer of the cooperative movement.]]
In 1761, the [[Fenwick Weavers' Society]] was formed in [[Fenwick, East Ayrshire]], [[Scotland]] to sell [[discounts and allowances|discount]]ed [[oatmeal]] to local workers.&lt;ref&gt;Carrell, Severin. [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/07/retail.uknews Strike Rochdale from the record books. The Co-op began in Scotland.], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 7 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Its services expanded to include assistance with savings and loans, emigration and education. In 1810, [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[social reform]]er [[Robert Owen]], from Newtown in mid-[[Wales]], and his partners purchased [[New Lanark]] mill from Owen's father-in-law [[David Dale]] and proceeded to introduce better labour standards including discounted retail shops where profits were passed on to his employees. Owen left New Lanark to pursue other forms of cooperative organization and develop coop ideas through writing and lecture. Cooperative communities were set up in [[Glasgow]], [[Indiana]] and [[Hampshire]], although ultimately unsuccessful. In 1828, [[William King (doctor)|William King]] set up a newspaper, ''The Cooperator'', to promote Owen's thinking, having already set up a cooperative store in Brighton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/drwilliamkingcoo00king/drwilliamkingcoo00king_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Dr. William King and the Co-operator, 1828–1830"|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. William King and the Co-operator, 1828–1830, T. W. MERCER, OL6459685M&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rochdale Pioneers|Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers]], (RCEP) founded in 1844, is usually considered the first successful cooperative enterprise, used as a model for modern coops, following the '[[Rochdale Principles]]'. A group of 28 weavers and other artisans in [[Rochdale]], England set up the society to open their own store selling food items they could not otherwise afford. Within ten years there were over a thousand cooperative societies in the United Kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Other events such as the founding of a [[friendly society]] by the [[Tolpuddle Martyrs]] in 1832 were key occasions in the creation of organized labor and consumer movements.&lt;ref&gt;Marlow, Joyce, The Tolpuddle Martyrs, London :History Book Club, (1971) &amp; Grafton Books, (1985) {{ISBN|0-586-03832-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friendly Societies established forums through which [[one member, one vote]] was practiced in organisation decision-making. The principles challenged the idea that a person should be an owner of [[property]] before being granted a political voice. Throughout the second half of the nineteenth century (and then repeatedly every twenty years or so) there was a surge in the number of cooperative organisations, both in commercial practice and civil society, operating to advance [[democracy]] and [[universal suffrage]] as a political principle.&lt;ref&gt;Rothschild, J., Allen-Whitt, J. (1986) ''The Cooperative Workplace'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Friendly Societies and consumer cooperatives became the dominant form of organization amongst working people in Anglosphere [[industrial societies]] prior to the rise of [[trade unions]] and industrial factories. Weinbren reports that by the end of the 19th century, over 80% of British working age men and 90% of Australian working age men were members of one or more Friendly Society.&lt;ref name="Weinbren"&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lab/88/weinbren.html Weinbren, D. &amp; James, B. (2005) "Getting a Grip: the Roles of Friendly Societies in Australia and Britain Reappraised", Labour History, Vol. 88].&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-nineteenth century, [[mutual organisation]]s embraced these ideas in economic enterprises, firstly amongst tradespeople, and later in cooperative stores, educational institutes, financial institutions and industrial enterprises. The common thread (enacted in different ways, and subject to the constraints of various systems of national law) is the principle that an enterprise or association should be owned and controlled by the people it serves, and share any surpluses on the basis of each member's cooperative contribution (as a producer, labourer or consumer) rather than their capacity to invest financial capital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do;jsessionid=9F0FA205C77BB6EEBEA9AB506E11BEE8?contentType=Article&amp;contentId=1740497 Ridley-Duff, R. J. (2008) "Social Enterprise as a Socially Rational Business"], International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour and Research, 14(5): 291-312.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Co-operative Alliance]] was the first international association formed (1895) by the cooperative movement.{{cn|date=June 2017}} It includes the [[World Council of Credit Unions]]. A second organization formed later in Germany: the International [[Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen|Raiffeisen]] Union. In the United States, the [[National Cooperative Business Association]] (NCBA CLUSA; the abbreviation of the organization retains the initials of its former name, Cooperative League of the USA) serves as the [[Economic sector | sector]]'s oldest national membership association. It is dedicated to ensuring that cooperative businesses have the same opportunities as other businesses operating in the country and that consumers have access to cooperatives in the marketplace. 

In 1945 [[Artturi Ilmari Virtanen]] received Nobel prize for chemistry for AIV silage which improved milk production and a method of preserving butter, the AIV salt, which led to increased Finnish butter exports. He had started his career in chemistry in [[Valio]], a cooperative of dairy farmers in which he headed the research department for 50 years and where all his major inventions were first put to practice.

By 2004 a new association focused on worker co-ops was founded, the [[United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives]].

The cooperative movement has been fueled globally by ideas of [[economic democracy]]. Economic democracy is a socioeconomic philosophy that suggests an expansion of decision-making power from a small minority of corporate shareholders to a larger majority of public stakeholders. There are many different approaches to thinking about and building economic democracy. Anarchists are committed to [[libertarian socialism]] and have focused on local organization, including locally managed cooperatives, linked through confederations of unions, cooperatives and communities. Marxists, who as socialists have likewise held and worked for the goal of democratizing productive and reproductive relationships, often placed a greater strategic emphasis on confronting the larger scales of human organization. As they viewed the capitalist class to be politically, militarily and culturally mobilized for the purpose of maintaining an exploitable [[working class]], they fought in the early 20th century to appropriate from the capitalist class the society's collective political capacity in the form of [[Sovereign state|the state]], either through [[democratic socialism]], or through what came to be known as [[Leninism]]. Though they regard the state as an unnecessarily oppressive institution, Marxists considered appropriating national and international-scale capitalist institutions and resources (such as the state) to be an important first pillar in creating conditions favorable to solidaristic economies.&lt;ref&gt;Rothschild, J., Allen-Whitt, J. (1986) ''The cooperative workplace'', Cambridge University Press, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cliff, T., Cluckstein, D. (1988) ''The Labour Party: A Marxist History'', London: Bookmarks.&lt;/ref&gt; With the declining influence of the [[USSR]] after the 1960s, socialist strategies pluralized, though economic democratizers have not as yet established a fundamental challenge to the [[hegemony]] of global [[neoliberal]] capitalism.

==Meaning==

=== {{anchor|Cooperative identity}} Identity===

====Coop principles and values====

Cooperative principles are the seven guidelines by which coops put their values into practice, often called the seven [[Rochdale Principles]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ica.coop/en/whats-co-op/co-operative-identity-values-principles|title = Co-operative identity, values &amp; principles|date = |access-date = |website = ICA|publisher = International Cooperative Alliance|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Voluntary and open membership
#Democratic member control
#Economic participation by members
#Autonomy and independence
#Education, training and information
#Cooperation among cooperatives
#Concern for community

Cooperatives values, in the tradition of its founders, are based on "self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity and solidarity." Co-operative members believe in the ethical values of honesty, openness, social responsibility and caring for others.

====Coop Marque and domain====
Since 2002, [[International Cooperative Alliance|ICA]] cooperatives and [[World Council of Credit Unions|WOCCU]] [[credit union]]s could be distinguished by use of a [[.coop]] domain.  In 2014, ICA introduced the Global Cooperative Marque&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://identity.coop/|title = Coop Marque|date = |access-date = |website = Coop Identity|publisher = International Cooperative Alliance|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; for use by ICA's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ica.coop/en/co-operatives-adopt-co-operative-marque|title = Co-operatives, adopt the Co-operative Marque|date = |access-date = |website = Co-op Marque|publisher = International Co-operative Alliance.|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperative members and by WOCCU's Credit Union members so they can be further identified&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ica.coop/en/blueprint-themes/identity|title = Coop Identity|date = |access-date = |website = Coop Marque|publisher = International Cooperative Alliance|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; by their coop [[ethical consumerism]] label.  The marque is used today by thousands of cooperatives in more than a hundred countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.domains.coop/co-operative-identity/marque-register/|title = Coop Marque Register|date = |access-date = |website = Domains.Coop|publisher = International Cooperative Alliance|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The .coop domain and Co-operative Marque were designed as a new symbol of the global cooperative movement and its collective identity in the digital age.  The Co-operative Marque and domain is reserved just for co-operatives, credit unions and organisations that support co-operatives; is distinguished by its ethical badge that subscribes to the seven ICA Cooperative Principles and Co-op Values. Co-ops can be identified on the Internet through the use of the [[.coop]] [[gTLD|suffix of internet addresses]]. Organizations using .coop domain names must adhere to the basic co-op values.

===Cooperatives as legal entities===
A cooperative is a [[legal person|legal entity]] owned and democratically controlled by its members. Members often have a close association with the enterprise as producers or consumers of its products or services, or as its employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.coop/what-co-operative|title=What is a co-operative - Co-operatives UK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The legal entities have a range of social characteristics. Membership is open, meaning that anyone who satisfies certain non-discriminatory conditions may join. Economic benefits are distributed proportionally to each member's level of participation in the cooperative, for instance, by a dividend on sales or purchases, rather than according to [[capital (economics)|capital]] invested.&lt;ref name=Identity&gt;International Cooperative Alliance.[http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles.html Statement on the Cooperative Identity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204081503/http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles.html |date=4 February 2012 }}. Retrieved on: 2011-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperatives may be classified as either ''worker'', ''consumer'', ''producer'', ''purchasing'' or ''housing'' cooperatives.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew McLeod (December 2006). [http://www.nwcdc.coop/Resources/CSS/CSS01Types.pdf Types of Cooperatives]. Northwest Cooperative Development Centre. Retrieved on: 2011-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt; They are distinguished from other forms of incorporation in that profit-making or economic stability are balanced by the interests of the community.&lt;ref name = Identity/&gt;

There are specific forms of incorporation for cooperatives in some countries, e.g. [[Finland]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2013/20130421 Osuuskuntalaki] (421/2013, Cooperatives act).§2: "Osuuskunta on jäsenistään erillinen oikeushenkilö, joka syntyy rekisteröimisellä." This translates as, "A cooperative is a legal person separate from its persons, born by registration." Finlex database. Retrieved 2015-12-04. {{Fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coopdevelopment.org.au/coopglossary.html#da|title=Australian Co-operative Glossary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cooperatives may take the form of companies limited by shares or by guarantee, partnerships or unincorporated associations. In the UK they may also use the [[industrial and provident society]] structure. In the US, cooperatives are often organized as non-capital stock corporations under state-specific cooperative laws. Cooperatives often share their earnings with the membership as [[dividend]]s, which are divided among the members according to their participation in the enterprise, such as patronage, instead of according to the value of their capital shareholdings (as is done by a [[joint stock company]]).

== Economic stability ==
{{Main|Economic stability}}
[[Capital and the Debt Trap]] reports that "cooperatives tend to have a longer life than other types of enterprise, and thus a higher level of entrepreneurial sustainability". This [[wikt:resilient|resilience]] has been attributed to how cooperatives share risks and rewards between members, how they harness the ideas of many and how members have a tangible ownership stake in the business. Additionally, "cooperative banks build up [[counter-cyclical]] buffers that function well in case of a crisis," and are less likely to lead members and clients towards a [[debt trap]] (p.&amp;nbsp;216). This is explained by their more democratic governance that reduces [[perverse incentive]]s and subsequent contributions to [[economic bubble]]s.

===In Europe===
A 2013 report by [[ILO]] concluded that [[cooperative banking | cooperative banks]] outperformed their competitors during the [[financial crisis of 2007-2008]]. The cooperative banking sector had 20% market share of the European banking sector, but accounted for only 7 per cent of all the write-downs and losses between the third quarter of 2007 and first quarter of 2011. Cooperative banks were also over-represented in lending to small and medium-sized businesses in all of the 10 countries included in the report&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---emp_ent/---coop/documents/publication/wcms_207768.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

A 2013 report published by the UK Office for National Statistics showed that in the UK the rate of survival of cooperatives after five years was 80 percent compared with only 41 percent for all other enterprises.&lt;ref name="uk.coop"/&gt; A further study found that after ten years 44 percent of cooperatives were still in operation, compared with only 20 percent for all enterprises.

A 2012 report published by The European Confederation of cooperatives and worker-owned enterprises active in industry and services showed that in France and Spain, worker cooperatives and social cooperatives “have been more resilient than conventional enterprises during the economic crisis”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cecop.coop/IMG/pdf/report_cecop_2012_en_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===In North America===

====In the United States of America====
In a 2007 study by the World Council of Credit Unions, the 5-year survival rate of cooperatives in the United States was found to be 90% in comparison to 3-5% for traditional businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.coop/story/fact-sheet|title=10 Facts About Cooperative Enterprise - Grassroots Economic Organizing|website=www.geo.coop}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Credit union]]s, a type of cooperative bank, had five times lower failure rate than other banks during the financial crisis&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2011/11/22/in-pictures-banks-vs-credit-unions-in-the-financia.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and more than doubled lending to small businesses between 2008 - 2016, from $30 billion to $60 billion, while lending to small businesses overall during the same period declined by around $100 billion&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sba.gov/advocacy/how-did-bank-lending-small-business-united-states-fare-after-financial-crisis&lt;/ref&gt;.

A 2010 report by the Ministry of Economic Development, Innovation and Export in Québec found that the five-year survival rate and 10-year survival rate of cooperatives in Québec to be 62% and 44% respectively compared to 35% and 20% for conventional firms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ontario.coop/cms/documents/212/2008_Quebec_Co-op_Survival_Report_Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Another report by the BC-Alberta Social economy Research Alliance found that the three-year survival rate of cooperatives in Alberta to be 81.5% in comparison to 48% for traditional firms.&lt;ref name="wisc.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwcc.wisc.edu/pdf/BALTA_A11_report_BC.pdf|title=A11 Report - Alberta Co-op Survival (PDF)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another report by the aforementioned Research Alliance found that in British-Columbia, the 5-year survival rates for cooperatives between 2000 and 2010 to be 66.6% in comparison to conventional businesses that had 43% and 39% in the years 1984 and 1993 respectively&lt;ref name="wisc.edu"/&gt;

== Types of cooperatives ==
[[File:Co-op City Hutch River crop.jpg|thumb|[[Co-op City, Bronx|Co-op City]] in [[The Bronx]], [[New York City]] is the largest cooperative housing development in the world, with 55,000 people.&lt;ref name="Urban Mass: A Look at Co-op City"&gt;Whitsett, Ross. [http://cooperator.com/articles/1354/1/Urban-Mass/Page1.html Urban Mass: A Look at Co-op City.] ''[[The Cooperator]]''. December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Zuerich Migroshochhaus 5.jpg|thumb|The two largest supermarkets chains in [[Switzerland]], [[Migros]] and [[Coop (Switzerland)|Coop]], are cooperatives. The third largest bank, [[Raiffeisen (Switzerland)|Raiffeisen]], is a cooperative as well.]]

The top 300 largest cooperatives were listed in 2007 by the [[International Co-operative Alliance]]. 80% were involved in either [[agricultural cooperative | agriculture]], [[cooperative banking | finance]], or retail and more than half were in the United States, Italy, or France. 

===Consumers' cooperative===
{{Main article|Consumers'  cooperative}}
A consumers' cooperative is a business owned by its customers. Members vote on major decisions and elect the board of directors from among their own number. The first of these was set up in 1844 in the North-West of England by 28 weavers who wanted to sell food at a lower price than the local shops. 

====Retail cooperative====
Retail cooperatives are retailers, such as grocery stores, owned by their customers. They should not be confused with retailers' cooperatives, whose members are retailers rather than consumers. In Denmark and Finland the company with the largest market share in grocery store sector is a customer owned cooperative&lt;ref&gt;https://www.statista.com/statistics/565747/market-share-of-selected-grocery-retailers-in-denmark/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pty.fi/front-page/finnish-grocery-trade/&lt;/ref&gt; .

====Housing cooperative====
{{Main article|Housing cooperative|Building cooperative}}

A [[housing cooperative]] is a legal mechanism for ownership of housing where residents either own [[Share (finance)|shares]] (share capital co-op) reflecting their equity in the cooperative's real estate, or have membership and occupancy rights in a [[not-for-profit]] cooperative (non-share capital co-op), and they underwrite their housing through paying subscriptions or rent.

Housing cooperatives come in three basic equity structures
*In '''market-rate housing cooperatives''', members may sell their shares in the cooperative whenever they like for whatever price the market will bear, much like any other residential property. Market-rate co-ops are very common in [[New York City]].
*'''Limited equity housing cooperatives''', which are often used by [[affordable housing]] developers, allow members to own some equity in their home, but limit the sale price of their membership share to that which they paid.
*'''Group equity''' or '''zero-equity housing cooperatives''' do not allow members to own equity in their residences and often have rental agreements well below market rates.

Members of a building cooperative (in Britain known as a self-build housing cooperative) pool resources to build housing, normally using a high proportion of their own labor. When the building is finished, each member is the sole owner of a homestead, and the cooperative may be dissolved.

This collective effort was at the origin of many of Britain's [[building societies]], which however, developed into "permanent" [[Mutual organization|mutual]] [[savings and loan]] organisations, a term which persisted in some of their names (such as the former ''Leeds Permanent''). Nowadays such self-building may be financed using a step-by-step [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] which is released in stages as the building is completed. The term may also refer to worker cooperatives in the building trade.

====Utility cooperative====
{{Main article|Utility cooperative}}
A utility cooperative is a type of [[consumers' cooperative]] that is tasked with the delivery of a [[public utility]] such as [[electricity]], [[water]] or [[telecommunications]] services to its members. [[Profit (accounting)|Profits]] are either reinvested into [[infrastructure]] or distributed to members in the form of "patronage" or "capital credits", which are essentially [[dividend]]s paid on a member's [[investment]] into the cooperative. In the United States, many cooperatives were formed to provide rural electrical and telephone service as part of the [[New Deal]].  ''See [[Rural Utilities Service]]''.

In the case of electricity, cooperatives are generally either generation and transmission (G&amp;T) co-ops that create and send power via the transmission grid or local distribution co-ops that gather electricity from a variety of sources and send it along to homes and businesses.

In Tanzania, it has been proven that the cooperative method is helpful in water distribution. When the people are involved with their own water, they care more because the quality of their work has a direct effect on the quality of their water.

====Credit unions, cooperative banking and co-operative insurance====
{{Main article|Cooperative banking|Credit union}}
[[File:Co-operative Bank head office 20051019.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Co-operative Bank]]'s head office in [[Manchester]].  The statue in front is of [[Robert Owen]], a pioneer in the cooperative movement.]]
[[Credit union]]s are cooperative [[financial institution]]s that are owned and controlled by their members. Credit unions provide the same [[financial services]] as banks but are considered [[not-for-profit]] organizations and adhere to [[Rochdale Principles|cooperative principles]].

Credit unions originated in mid-19th-century Germany through the efforts of pioneers [[Franz Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch|Franz Herman Schulze'Delitzsch]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen]]. The concept of financial cooperatives crossed the Atlantic at the turn of the 20th century, when the ''caisse populaire'' movement was started by [[Alphonse Desjardins (co-operator)|Alphonse Desjardins]] in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]. In 1900, from his home in [[Lévis, Quebec|Lévis]], he opened North America's first credit union, marking the beginning of the [[Mouvement Desjardins]]. Eight years later, Desjardins provided guidance for the first credit union in the [[Credit unions in the United States|United States]], where there are now about 7,950 active status federally insured credit unions, with almost 90 million members and more than $679 billion on deposit.

Cooperative banking networks, which were nationalized in Eastern Europe, work now as real cooperative institutions. In Poland, the SKOK (''Spółdzielcze Kasy Oszczędnościowo-Kredytowe'') network has grown to serve over 1 million members via 13,000 branches, and is larger than the country’s largest conventional bank.

In [[Nordic Countries|Scandinavia]], there is a clear distinction between [[mutual savings bank]]s (Sparbank) and true [[credit unions]] (Andelsbank).

The oldest cooperative banks in Europe, based on the ideas of Friedrich Raiffeisen, are joined together in the 'Urgenossen'.

===Worker cooperative===
{{Main article|Worker cooperative}}
A [[worker cooperative]] or producer cooperative is a cooperative, that is owned and democratically controlled by its "worker-owners". There are no outside owners in a "pure" workers' cooperative, only the workers own shares of the business, though hybrid forms exist in which consumers, community members or capitalist investors also own some shares. In practice, control by worker-owners may be exercised through individual, collective or majority ownership by the workforce, or the retention of individual, collective or majority voting rights (exercised on a one-member one-vote basis). A worker cooperative, therefore, has the characteristic that the majority of its workforce owns shares, and the majority of shares are owned by the workforce. Membership is not always compulsory for employees, but generally only employees can become members either directly (as shareholders) or indirectly through membership of a trust that owns the company.

The impact of political ideology on practice constrains the development of cooperatives in different countries. In India, there is a form of workers' cooperative which insists on compulsory membership for all employees and compulsory employment for all members.  That is the form of the [[Indian Coffee House]]s. This system was advocated by the Indian communist leader [[A. K. Gopalan]]. In places like the UK, common ownership (indivisible collective ownership) was popular in the 1970s. Cooperative Societies only became legal in Britain after the passing of [[Industrial and Provident Societies Partnership Act 1852|Slaney's Act]] in 1852. In 1865 there were 651 registered societies with a total membership of well over 200,000. There are now more than 400 worker cooperatives in the UK, [[Suma (co-operative)|Suma Wholefoods]] being the largest example with a turnover of £24 million.

====Business and employment cooperative====
{{Main article|Business and employment co-operative}}
''Business and employment cooperatives'' (BECs) are a subset of worker cooperatives that represent a new approach to providing support to the creation of new businesses.

Like other business creation support schemes, BEC's enable budding entrepreneurs to experiment with their business idea while benefiting from a secure income.  The innovation BECs introduce is that once the business is established the entrepreneur is not forced to leave and set up independently, but can stay and become a full member of the cooperative. The micro-enterprises then combine to form one multi-activity enterprise whose members provide a mutually supportive environment for each other.

BECs thus provide budding business people with an easy transition from inactivity to self-employment, but in a collective framework. They open up new horizons for people who have ambition but who lack the skills or confidence needed to set off entirely on their own –  or who simply want to carry on an independent economic activity but within a supportive group context.

===Purchasing cooperative===
{{Main article|Purchasing cooperative}}
A "purchasing cooperative" is a type of cooperative arrangement, often among businesses, to agree to aggregate demand to get lower prices from selected suppliers. Retailers' cooperatives are a form of purchasing cooperative.

Major purchasing cooperatives include [[Best Western]], [[ACE Hardware]] and [[CCA Global Partners]].

''Agricultural service cooperatives'' provide various services to their individual farming members, and ''agricultural production cooperatives'', where production resources such as land or machinery are pooled and members farm jointly.&lt;ref name=Cobia&gt;Cobia, David, editor, ''Cooperatives in Agriculture'', Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ (1989), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Agricultural supply store|Agricultural supply]] cooperatives aggregate purchases, storage, and distribution of farm inputs for their members. By taking advantage of volume discounts and utilizing other [[economy of scale|economies of scale]], supply cooperatives bring down members' costs. Supply cooperatives may provide seeds, fertilizers, chemicals, fuel, and farm machinery. Some supply cooperatives also operate machinery pools that provide mechanical field services (e.g., plowing, harvesting) to their members. Known examples include the cranberry-and-grapefruit cooperative [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]], [[collective farm]]s in [[socialist states]] and the [[kibbutzim]] in Israel.

===Producer cooperative===
Producer cooperatives consists of producers as it's members, and provides services involved in moving a product from the point of production to the point of consumption. Unlike worker cooperatives, they allow businesses with multiple employees to join.

[[Agricultural marketing]] cooperatives operate a series of interconnected activities involving planning production, growing and [[harvest]]ing, grading, packing, transport, storage, [[food processing]], distribution and sale. Agricultural marketing cooperatives are often formed to promote specific commodities.

Commercially successful agricultural marketing cooperatives include India's [[Amul]] (dairy products), which is the world's largest producer of milk and milk products, [[Dairy Farmers of America]] (dairy products) in the United States, and Malaysia's [[FELDA]] ([[palm oil]]).

===Multi-stakeholder cooperatives===
Multi-stakeholder cooperatives include representation from different stakeholder groups, such as both consumers and workers.

====Social cooperative====
Cooperatives traditionally combine social benefit interests with capitalistic property-right interests. Cooperatives achieve a mix of social and capital purposes by democratically governing distribution questions by and between equal by not controlling members. Democratic oversight of decisions to equitably distribute assets and other benefits means capital ownership is arranged in a way for social benefit inside the organization. External societal benefit is also encouraged by incorporating the operating-principle of cooperation between co-operatives. In the final year of the 20th century, cooperatives banded together to establish a number of [[social enterprise]] agencies which have moved to adopt the multi-stakeholder cooperative model.  In the years 1994–2009 the [[European Union|EU]] and its member nations gradually revised national accounting systems to "make visible" the increasing contribution of [[social economy]] organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Monzon, J. L. &amp; Chaves, R. (2008) "The European Social Economy: Concept and Dimensions of the Third Sector", ''Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics'', 79(3/4): 549-577.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Social cooperative}}
A particularly successful form of multi-stakeholder cooperative is the Italian "social cooperative", of which some 11,000 exist.&lt;ref&gt;In 2011 the official total was 11,264: ISTAT, ''9° Censimento dell’industria e dei servizi'' (Roma, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; "Type A" social cooperatives bring together providers and beneficiaries of a social service as members. "Type B" social cooperatives bring together permanent workers and previously unemployed people who wish to integrate into the labor market. They are legally defined as follows:
*no more than 80% of profits may be distributed, interest is limited to the bond rate and dissolution is altruistic (assets may not be distributed)
*the cooperative has legal personality and limited liability
*the objective is the general benefit of the community and the social integration of citizens
*those of type B integrate disadvantaged people into the labour market. The categories of disadvantage they target may include physical and mental disability, drug and alcohol addiction, developmental disorders and problems with the law. They do not include other factors of disadvantage such as unemployment, race, sexual orientation or abuse.
*type A cooperatives provide health, social or educational services
*various categories of stakeholder may become members, including paid employees, beneficiaries, volunteers (up to 50% of members), financial investors and public institutions. In type B cooperatives at least 30% of the members must be from the disadvantaged target groups
*voting is one person one vote

==== New generation cooperative ====
'''New generation cooperatives''' (NGCs) are an adaptation of traditional cooperative structures to modern, capital intensive industries.  They are sometimes described as a hybrid between traditional co-ops and limited liability companies or public benefit corporations. They were first developed in [[California]] and spread and flourished in the US [[Mid-West]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/bmi6646 |title=New Generation Cooperatives - 10 Things You Need to Know |publisher=Government of Alberta: Agriculture and Rural Development |date= |accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are now common in Canada where they operate primarily in agriculture and food services, where their primary purpose is to [[value added|add value]] to [[primary products]].  For example, producing [[Ethanol fuel|ethanol]] from [[maize|corn]], [[pasta]] from [[durum wheat]], or [[Goat's milk cheese|gourmet cheese]] from [[Goat's milk|goat’s milk]].  A representative example of an operating NGC is the [[Fourth Estate (association)]], a multi-stakeholder NGC journalism association.

==== Platform cooperative ====
{{Main article|Platform cooperative}}
A platform cooperative, or platform co-op, is a cooperatively owned, democratically governed business that establishes a computing platform, and uses a protocol, website or mobile app to facilitate the sale of goods and services. Platform cooperatives are an alternative to venture capital funded platforms insofar as they are owned and governed by those who depend on them most—workers, users, and other relevant stakeholders. Proponents of platform cooperativism claim that, by ensuring the financial and social value of a platform circulate among these participants, platform cooperatives will bring about a more equitable and fair digitally mediated economy in contrast with the extractive models of corporate intermediaries. Platform cooperatives differ from traditional cooperatives not only due to their use of digital technologies, but also by their contribution to the commons for the purpose of fostering an equitable social and economic landscape.

====Volunteer cooperative====
A volunteer cooperative is a cooperative that is run by and for a network of volunteers, for the benefit of a defined membership or the general public, to achieve some goal. Depending on the structure, it may be a [[collective]] or [[mutual organization]], which is operated according to the principles of cooperative governance. The most basic form of volunteer-run cooperative is a [[voluntary association]]. A [[Fraternity|lodge]] or [[social club]] may be organized on this basis. A volunteer-run co-op is distinguished from a [[worker cooperative]] in that the latter is by definition [[Employee-owned corporation|employee-owned]], whereas the volunteer cooperative is typically a [[non-stock corporation]], volunteer-run [[consumer cooperative|consumer co-op]] or [[service organization]], in which workers and beneficiaries jointly participate in management decisions and receive discounts on the basis of [[sweat equity]].

===Federal or secondary cooperative===
{{Main article|Cooperative Federation}}
In some cases, cooperative societies find it advantageous to form [[cooperative federation]]s in which all of the members are themselves cooperatives. Historically, these have predominantly come in the form of cooperative wholesale societies, and cooperative unions. Cooperative federations are a means through which cooperative societies can fulfill the sixth [[Rochdale Principles|Rochdale Principle]], [[cooperation among cooperatives]], with the [[International Cooperative Alliance|ICA]] noting that "Cooperatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the cooperative movement by working together through local, regional and international structures."
{{See also|List of Co-operative Federations}}

====Cooperative union====
A second common form of cooperative federation is a cooperative union, whose objective (according to Gide) is "to develop the spirit of solidarity among societies and... in a word, to exercise the functions of a government whose authority, it is needless to say, is purely moral." [[Co-operatives UK]] and the [[International Cooperative Alliance]] are examples of such arrangements.

====Cooperative political movements====
{{anchor|Cooperative Party}}
In some countries with a strong cooperative sector, such as the UK, cooperatives may find it advantageous to form political groupings to represent their interests. The British [[Co-operative Party]], the Canadian [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]] and [[United Farmers of Alberta]] are prime examples of such arrangements.

=====UK=====
The [[British cooperative movement]] formed the [[Co-operative Party]] in the early 20th century to represent members of [[consumers' cooperative]]s in Parliament, which was the first of its kind.  The Co-operative Party now has a permanent electoral pact with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] meaning someone cannot be a member if they support a party other than Labour. [[Plaid Cymru]] also run a credit union that is constituted as a co-operative, called the 'Plaid Cymru Credit Union'.&lt;ref name="UCPCCU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucpccu.org/|title=Plaid Cymru Credit Union website|work=ucpccu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK cooperatives retain a strong market share in [[Co-op (supermarket)|food retail]], insurance, banking, funeral services, and the travel industry in many parts of the country, although this is still significantly lower than other business models.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Clarke, (2000) "Retail power, competition and local consumer choice in the UK grocery sector", European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 34 Iss: 8, pp.975 - 1002&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Philippines=====
The Cooperative NATCCO Party ([[Coop-NATCCO]]) is a party-list in the Philippines which serves as the electoral wing of the National Confederation of Cooperatives (NATCCO). Coop-NATCCO has represented the Philippine co-operative sector in the Philippine 11th Congress since 1998.

==Women in cooperatives==
{{main article|Women in cooperatives}}
Since cooperatives are based on values like [[self-help]], [[democracy]], [[Social equality|equality]], [[Equity (economics)|equity]], and [[solidarity]], they can play a particularly strong role in empowering women, especially in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://social.un.org/index/Cooperatives/WhatisaCooperative.aspx|title=What is a Cooperative?|work=un.org|access-date=30 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326100349/http://social.un.org/index/Cooperatives/WhatisaCooperative.aspx|archive-date=26 March 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperatives allow women who might have been isolated and working individually to band together and create [[economies of scale]] as well as increase their own [[bargaining power]] in the market. In statements in advance of [[International Women's Day]] in early 2013, President of the [[International Cooperative Alliance]], [[Dame Pauline Green]], said, "Cooperative businesses have done so much to help women onto the ladder of economic activity.  With that comes community respect, political legitimacy and influence."

However, despite the supposed democratic structure of cooperatives and the values and benefits shared by members, due to [[gender norms]] on the traditional role of women, and other instilled cultural practices that sidestep attempted legal protections, women suffer a disproportionately low representation in cooperative membership around the world. Representation of women through ''active'' membership (showing up to meetings and voting), as well as in leadership and managerial positions is even lower.&lt;ref name="Nippierd2002"&gt;Nippierd, A. (2002). [http://media.microfinancelessons.com/resources/gender_issues_coops.pdf "Gender issues in cooperatives."] Geneva, Switzerland: International Labour Organization&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cooperatives in popular culture==
{{asof|2012}}, the number of memberships in cooperatives reached one billion,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.worldwatch.org/membership-co-operative-businesses-reaches-1-billion-0 Membership in Co-operative Businesses Reaches 1 Billion]," WorldWatch Institute&lt;/ref&gt; and so the organizational structure and movement has seeped into popular culture.

In the [[HBO]] drama television series ''[[The Wire]]'', several drug dealers create a democratic alliance called the [[New Day Co-Op]] with the interests of cutting back on violence and increasing business.

Co-opoly: The Game of Cooperatives is a popular [[board game]] played around the world that challenges players to work together to start and run a cooperative and overcome major hurdles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.toolboxfored.org/co-opoly-the-game-of-co-operatives/|title=Co-opoly: The Game of Co-operatives|work=The Toolbox for Education and Social Action}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/16512-teach-your-children-well-dont-play-monopoly "Teach Your Children Well: Don't Play Monopoly"], Truthout.org&lt;/ref&gt;

''My So-Called Housing Cooperative'' is a web series focusing on the humorous side of living in a housing co-op.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRkxz_vJ4MQW1sMfVWCbkG3r28QMrSVmL|title=My So-Called Housing Cooperative|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crime in France''' is combated by a range of [[Law enforcement in France|French law enforcement agencies]].

== Crime by type ==
===Murder===
{{Further|List of countries by intentional homicide rate}}

Though France homicide rate fluctuated substantially in recent years, it tended to decrease through 2000 - 2014 period ending at 1.2 cases per 100,000 population in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=homicide rate|url=https://knoema.com/atlas/France/topics/Crime-Statistics/Homicides/Homicide-rate|website=knoema}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Since 2014 several high-profile fatal terror attacks have happened in France, including the [[January 2015 Ile-de-France attacks]], the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]], the [[2016 Magnanville stabbing]], the [[2016 Nice attack]], the [[2016 Normandy church attack]], and the [[2018 Paris knife attack]]. These attacks have been one of the reasons for the homicide rate fluctuation after 2014.

In September 2018, a police chief was brutally stabbed to death in the city of [[Rodez]]. "The attacker was known to police. He had defaced the city hall door on 11 April," said Christian Teyssèdre, the Mayor of Rodez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45665476|title=Police chief stabbed to death in southern France|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rape ===
{{Further|Rape in France}}

In 1971, the rape rate stood at 2.0 per 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rape and Victims of Rape: A Socio-psychological Analysis|first=Vimala|last=Veeraraghavan|publisher=Northern Book Centre|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;While in 1995, it was 12.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Comparative Perspective on Major Social Problems|first=Rita James|last=Simon|pages=20–21|publisher=Lexington Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, it stood at 16.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/crime/CTS12_Sexual_violence.xls |title=Statistics : Crime : Sexual Violence |publisher=Unodc.org |accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2012 report, about 75,000 rapes take place each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Light Gang Rape Penalties Provoke Outcry in France|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/12/world/europe/in-france-light-gang-rape-penalties-prompt-outcry.html|date=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2014 article, about 5,000 to 7,000 of the rapes are [[gang rape]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/tournantes-le-calvaire-de-nina-et-stephanie_1162544.html |title=Tournantes: le calvaire de Nina et Stéphanie |work=L'Express |accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organized crime ===
{{Further|Milieu (organized crime in France)}}

The [[Milieu (organized crime in France)|Milieu]] is a category of organized criminals operating in France. These groups are quite often not ethnically French. Criminal groups associated with the ''Milieu'' work in every major city in France, but are mostly concentrated in [[Marseille]], [[Grenoble]], Paris, and [[Lyon]].&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;Lalam, Nacer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=racuuTvkim4C&amp;pg=PA359&amp; "How organised is organised crime in France?"] in ''Organised Crime in Europe: Concepts, Patterns and Control Policies in the''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corruption ===
{{Further|Corruption in France}}

In 2011, [[Transparency International]] concluded in its annual report for 2011 that France does not do enough to stop corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.rfi.fr/economy/20120906-corruption-watchdog-says-france-could-do-better "Corruption watchdog says France could do better"], Radio France Internationale, 6 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Taylor Nelson Sofres|TNS Sofres]] poll in October 2011 indicated that 72% of the French public had the perception that politicians are corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/21531035 "Bad smells"], ''The Economist'', 1 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== By location ==

=== Priority Security Zones (PSZ) ===
{{See also|Sensitive urban zone}}

In August 2012 the French Government announced the creation of fifteen ''Priority Security Zones (PSZ)'' in an effort to target crime hotspots. Extra police, riot police, detectives and members of the intelligence services are to be mobilised. Social services, educational bodies and charities also put extra resources into the selected areas.

The Neuhof area of [[Strasbourg]] was selected because of a need to tackle violent crime, and the historic rural town of [[Chambly, Oise|Chambly]] to the north of Paris is being focused on because of rising burglary rates and car theft. The northern quarter of [[Amiens]] in the [[Somme (department)|Somme]] region and areas of [[Seine-Saint-Denis]] to the north of Paris, which [[2005 French riots|witnessed fierce rioting in 2005]], are priority zones because of widespread drug dealing and a rampant black market.&lt;ref name="france1"&gt;[http://www.france24.com/en/20120804-france-15-hot-spots-crime-crackdown-marseille-lille-paris-guns-violence-chambly-manuel-valls "France to launch crackdown on 15 crime 'hot spots'"], France 24, 6 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paris ===
Violent crime is relatively uncommon in the city center. Pickpockets are the most significant problem and are commonly children under the age of 16 because they are difficult to prosecute. Pickpockets are very active on the rail link from Charles de Gaulle Airport to the city center.

The Paris Police Prefecture publishes a pamphlet entitled "Paris in Complete Safety" that provides practical advice and useful telephone numbers for visitors.In an emergency, dialing 17 will connect the caller to the police. You can also dial the Europe-wide emergency response number 112 to reach an operator for all kinds of emergency services (similar to the U.S. and Canadian 911 system). Non-French speakers may experience a delay while an English speaker is located.

In 2010, French interior minister [[Brice Hortefeux]] said that 85% of gang members in France were around Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/15913046 "Burn, baby, burn"], ''The Economist'', 15 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, thousands of demonstrators protested the Israeli-Gaza Conflict for over a week. During several instances rioters shouted anti-Semitic chants and attacked Jews while ransacking Jewish Synagogues and Jewish owned businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france24.com/en/20140721-banned-gaza-protest-paris-sarcelles-turns-violent-france-israel-palestinians/ "Banned Gaza protest in Paris suburb turns violent, again"], France 24, 21 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;Large demonstrations in Paris are generally managed by a strong police presence, but such events have the potential to become dangerous. Likewise, some sporting events, such as soccer matches, have occasionally degenerated into violence have continued into the streets.

In 2017,a Russian performance artist was detained in Paris after setting fire to the front of a branch of France's central bank&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist set fire to banks in Paris|url=http://www.euronews.com/2017/10/16/artist-sets-fire-to-bank-in-paris|website=euronews}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [13], On 03/10, in an affluent  neighbourhood near the Paris Saint-Germain's football ground, the police found four gas canisters doused with petrol and wired to connect to a mobile phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five arrested over  homemade bomb found near Paris stadium|url=http://www.euronews.com/2017/10/03/five-arrested-over-homemade-bomb-found-near-paris-stadium|website=euronews}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The government has  suspected bomb-making equipment found and arrests have been made in France and Spain &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-terror operations in Europe|url=http://www.euronews.com/2017/09/06/anti-terror-operations-in-europe|website=euronews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also hundreds of thousands of workers from Egypt, Indonesia and South Asia, who work as domestic and construction workers.

==Definition==
The territory of Jordan can be defined by the history of its creation after the end of [[World War I]], the [[League of Nations]] and redrawing of the borders of the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] littoral. The ensuing decisions, most notably the [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]], which created the [[Mandatory Palestine]]. In September 1922, [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] was formally identified as a subdivision of the Mandate Palestine after the [[League of Nations]] approved the British [[Transjordan memorandum]] which stated that the Mandate east of the [[Jordan River]] would be excluded from all the provisions dealing with Jewish settlement west of the Jordan River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1937_1938_5_YRAppendices.pdf |title=American Jewish Yearbook p.528 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''English diaspora''' consists of [[English people]] and their [[Lineal descendant|descendants]] who [[emigrated]] from [[England]]. The [[diaspora]] is concentrated in the [[English-speaking world]] in countries such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Scotland]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Wales]] and to a lesser extent, [[South Africa]], [[South America]] (most notably in [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]]), and continental [[Europe]].

==Origins of the English Empire==
The first organised large-scale English diaspora began when [[English Catholic]]s exiled themselves from [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII's]] religious policies to [[Hapsburg]] lands, especially the nearest Catholic intellectual centre, the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Louvain]] (in present-day [[Belgium]]) which was by the late 1540s a bastion of ultra-orthodoxy. This was redoubled by a further wave of emigration under [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI's]] more radically Protestant regime.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YFF8ynVL4wIC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=origins+of+english+diaspora&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qBOaeUKmWL&amp;sig=PI2RD3kFLkNPR-BM-skfj9JqXL4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwDmoVChMI9cOqqoOxxwIVy1waCh3IBwdZ#v=onepage&amp;q=origins%20of%20english%20diaspora&amp;f=false Locating the English Diaspora, 1500-2010] By Tanja Bueltmann, David T. Gleeson, Donald M. MacRaild (Page 18)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age of Discovery==
After the [[Age of Discovery]] the native peoples of [[England]] were among the earliest and by far the largest communities to [[European emigration|emigrate out of Europe]], and the [[British Empire]]'s expansion during the first half of the 19th century saw an extraordinary dispersion of English people, with particular concentrations in [[North America]] and [[Australasia]].&lt;ref name="BritDis47"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ember et al|2004|p=47}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Empire was "built on waves of migration overseas by British peoples",&lt;ref name="Marsh254"&gt;{{harvnb|Marshall|2001|p=254}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who left [[kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], later the United Kingdom, and reached across the globe and permanently affected population structures in three continents.&lt;ref name="BritDis47"/&gt; As a result of the [[British colonisation of the Americas]], what became the United States was "easily the greatest single destination of [[British diaspora|emigrant British]]", but in the [[Federation of Australia]] the British ethnic groups experienced a [[birth rate]] higher than anything seen before, resulting in the displacement of [[indigenous Australians]].&lt;ref name="BritDis47"/&gt;

==Americas==

===Argentina===
{{main|English Argentine}}
English settlers arrived in Buenos Aires in 1806 (then a Spanish colony) in small numbers, mostly as businessmen, when Argentina was an emerging nation and the settlers were welcomed for the stability they brought to commercial life. As the 19th century progressed more English families arrived, and many bought land to develop the potential of the Argentine pampas for the large-scale growing of crops. The English founded banks, developed the export trade in crops and animal products and imported the luxuries that the growing Argentine middle classes sought.&lt;ref name="BSIA001"&gt;{{cite news | title =Emigration of Scots, English and Welsh-speaking people to Argentina in the nineteenth century | publisher =British Settlers in Argentina—studies in 19th and 20th century emigration | url =http://www.argbrit.org/ | accessdate =8 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as those who went to Argentina as industrialists and major landowners, others went as [[Railroad engineer|railway engineers]], [[civil engineer]]s and to work in [[bank]]ing and [[commerce]].&lt;ref name="IAA001"&gt;{{cite news |title=Anglicans in Argentina |publisher=Iglesia Anglicana Argentina |url=http://www.anglicanaargentina.org.ar/English/HTML/church_home.htm# |accessdate=7 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228044624/http://www.anglicanaargentina.org.ar/English/HTML/church_home.htm |archivedate=28 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others went to become [[whaler]]s, [[missionaries]] and simply to seek out a future. English families sent second and younger sons, or what were described as the [[black sheep]] of the family, to Argentina to make their fortunes in [[cattle]] and [[wheat]]. English settlers introduced [[Association football|football]] to Argentina.&lt;ref name="Guardian657865"&gt;{{cite news | last =Kuper | first =Simon | title =The conflict lives on | publisher =[[The Guardian]] | date =25 February 2002 | url =https://www.theguardian.com/falklands/story/0,11707,657865,00.html | accessdate =7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some English families owned [[Plantation|sugar plantations]].&lt;ref name="IAA001"/&gt;

English culture, or a version of it as perceived from outside, had a noted effect on the [[culture of Argentina]], mainly in the middle classes. In 1888 local Anglo-Argentines established the [[Hurlingham Club (Argentina)|Hurlingham Club]], based on [[Hurlingham Club|its namesake]] in [[London]]. The city of [[Hurlingham, Buenos Aires]] and [[Hurlingham Partido]] in [[Buenos Aires Province]] later grew up around the club and took their names from it. The [[Córdoba Athletic Club]], one of the oldest sports clubs in Argentina, was founded in 1882 by Englishmen that lived in Córdoba working in the railways.

There are about 100,000 people of English descent in Argentina.&lt;ref name="nyt230685"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&amp;res=9A02E5D61039F930A15755C0A963948260|title=Fare of the country; Teatime: A bit of Britain in Argentina|last=Chavez|first=Lydia|date=23 June 1985|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{main|English Canadian}}
In the [[2006 Canadian Census]], 'English' was the most common ethnic origin (ethnic origin refers to the ethnic or cultural group(s) to which the respondent's ancestors belong&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/Products/Reference/dict/pop040.htm|title=ethnic origin, 2001 census|website=12.statcan.ca|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) recorded by respondents; 6,570,015 people described themselves as wholly or partly English, 16% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/highlights/ethnic/pages/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=PR&amp;Code=01&amp;Table=2&amp;Data=Count&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=7&amp;Display=All Ethnic origins, 2006 counts, for Canada, provinces and territories – 20% sample data], ''Statistics Canada'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, people identifying as "Canadian" but not English may have previously identified as English before the option of identifying as Canadian was available.&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/analysis/ethnicorigin/pdf/97-562-XIE2006001.pdf ''Canada's Ethnocultural Mosaic, 2006 Census''], (p.7) "...the presence of the Canadian example has led to an increase in "Canadian" being reported and has had an impact on the counts of other groups, especially for French, English, Irish and Scottish. People who previously reported these origins in the census had the tendency to now report Canadian."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
{{main|English Chileans}}
[[Chileans]] of English ancestry are estimated to number 700,000 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biografiadechile.cl/detalle.php?IdContenido=1673&amp;IdCategoria=91&amp;IdArea=488&amp;TituloPagina=Historia%20de%20Chile |title=Historia de Chile, Británicos y Anglosajones en Chile durante el siglo XIX |accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; (4% of the national population).

Since the [[Port of Valparaiso|Port of Valparaíso]] opened its coasts to free trade in 1811, the English began to congregate in [[Valparaíso]]. The first to arrive brought with them tools, articles of china, wool and cotton, with instructions to return with copper and hemp. This was the first exchange of what would become a deep-rooted commercial relationship between the UK and [[Chile]].

In the [[Valparaíso]] they constructed their largest and most important colony, bringing with them neighborhoods of English character, schools, social, [[sports clubs]], [[business organizations]] and [[periodicals]]. This influence is apparent in unique areas of Chilean society today, such as the bank and the national marina, as well as in certain social activities popular in the country, such as [[Association football|football]], horse racing, and drinking [[tea]].

The English eventually numbered more than 32,000 during the port of Valparaíso's boom period during the [[Sodium nitrate|saltpeter]] bonanza at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.galeon.com/typepad/ Inmigración británica en Valparaíso.]&lt;/ref&gt; The British colonial influence is important to understanding the boom and bust of the port of Valparaíso.

The English colony was also important in the northern zone of the country during the saltpeter boom, in the ports of [[Iquique]] and [[Pisagua, Chile|Pisagua]]. The ''King of Saltpeter'', [[John Thomas North]], was the principal backer of nitrate mining. The English legacy was reflected in the streets of the historic district of the city of [[Iquique]], with the foundation of various institutions, such as the Club Hípico (Racing Club). Nevertheless, said presence came to an end with the saltpeter crisis during the 1930s.

An important contingent of English immigrants also settled in the present-day region of [[Magallanes y la Antártica Chilena Region|Magallanes]]. In the same way, they established English families in other areas of the country, such as [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]], [[Coquimbo]], the [[Araucanía Region|Araucanía]], and [[Chiloé]].

===Nicaragua===
{{main|English settlement in Nicaragua}}
English people along the Caribbean Coast, or [[Miskito Coast]], of [[Nicaragua]] began in 1633. The area was controlled by Britain until 1860, and eventually integrated into Nicaragua by 1894. The Miskito Coast region divided into two autonomous regions within Nicaragua after 1987.
The first English settlers of the Miskito Coast arrived in 1633, exchanging products through primitive trade with the [[Miskitos]]. The English exchanged manufactured goods such as guns, machetes, beds, mirrors etc., in exchange for cocoa, animal skins, sarsaparilla, rubber, wood, and turtle shells. The formation of an English colony in the region led [[Spain]] to protest, but [[England]] managed to create a colony on the Caribbean Coast. This colony had two different, but complementary, production methods; one a capitalist basis and the other communal.

===Paraguay===
{{main|English people in Paraguay}}
The English people in Paraguay mostly arrived during the colonial period as investors and industrialists. They were noted throughout the [[Southern cone]] region of [[Paraguay]] as being skilled farmers, investors, and bankers and as having created many of the regions railways and settled vast tracts of land.

In the modern day however it is assumed most have become a part of the wider Paraguayan ethnicity, although there are still some in Paraguay who identify as "English".
The English indirectly and probably inadvertently played a major part in Paraguay's continual existence, because the [[British Empire]] had invested heavily throughout [[South America]], including [[Paraguay]].

{{main|English Americans}}
English Immigration began in the 1500s. [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] led expeditions to North America in order to found new settlements and find gold and named [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]] in honor of Elizabeth, the Virgin Queen. In 1585 Sir Walter Raleigh sent several shiploads of colonists to the 'New World', who settled on [[Roanoke Island]]. It was here that [[Eleanor Dare|Eleanor White Dare]] gave birth to a daughter, [[Virginia Dare]], the first child born of English parents in America. The first immigrants mysteriously disappeared and Roanoke was given the nickname of "[[the Lost Colony]]".

English settlement in America recommenced with [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in the [[Virginia Colony]] in 1607. With the permission of [[James I of England|James I]], three ships (the ''[[Susan Constant]], [[Discovery (1602 ship)|The Discovery]]'' and ''[[Godspeed (ship)|The God Speed]]'') sailed from England and landed at [[Cape Henry]] in April, under the captainship of [[Christopher Newport]],&lt;ref name="English Emigration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAEengland.htm|title=English Emigration|website=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had been hired by the [[London Company]] to lead expeditions to what is now America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/people/A0835458.html|title=Newport, Christopher|website=Infoplease.com|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1630 another religious group left England in search of religious freedom. This group was called the [[Puritans]] who represented the next wave of English Immigration to America. The 'Great Migration' between 1620 and 1640 to America led to the establishment of the first [[13 Colonies]]. It is estimated that over 50,000 undertook the 3,000 mile journey to America during the Great Migration.

The overwhelming majority of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] of the [[United States of America]] were of English extraction, including [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[George Washington]], [[John Adams]], [[James Madison]]&lt;ref name="americanheritage.com"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.americanheritage.com/people/presidents/madison_james.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212053206/http://www.americanheritage.com/people/presidents/madison_james.shtml |archivedate=December 12, 2010|title = The Presidents: James Madison|website = American Heritage|deadurl = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Jefferson]].

The table shows the ethnic English population in the United States from 1700 to 2013. In 1700 the total population of the American colonies was 250,888 of which 223,071 (89%) were white and 80% were ethnically [[England and Wales|English and Welsh]].&lt;ref name="books.google.es"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Colonial America To 1763"/&gt;

In the 2013 [[American Community Survey]], [[English American]]s were (7.7%) of the total United States population behind the [[German American]]s at (14.6%) and [[Irish American]]s at (10.5%).&lt;ref name="2013 ACS"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/13_1YR/DP02 | title = Selected Social Characteristics in the United States (DP02): 2013 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates| publisher = U.S. Census Bureau | accessdate = December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[demography|demographers]] regard this as a serious undercount, as the index of inconsistency is high and many, if not most, people from English stock have a tendency (since the introduction of a new 'American' category in the 2000 census) to identify as simply [[American ethnicity|Americans]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SVoAXh-dNuYC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=Sharing+the+dream:+white+males+in+multicultural+America++english+ancestry&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America] By Dominic J.

[[Americans]] of English heritage are often seen, and identify, as simply "American" due to the many historic cultural ties between England and the U.S. and their influence on the country's population. Relative to ethnic groups of other European origins, this may be due to the early establishment of English settlements; as well as to non-English groups having emigrated in order to establish significant communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SoOXrMVp5BsC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=english+ancestry+united+states&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=english%20ancestry%20united%20states&amp;f=false From many strands: ethnic and racial groups in contemporary América] by Stanley Lieberson&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{main|English Australians}}
Australia's biggest city Sydney was founded by the British government as a penal colony. Visitors described the English character of Sydney for at least the first 50 years after 1788, noting the traditional English appearance of the churches overlooking the convict barracks. First-generation Sydney residents, other than the disappearing Aborigines, were predominantly English. 160,000 convicts came to Australia between 1788 and 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australia's founding felons get a long-delayed pardon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/19/world/australia-s-founding-felons-get-a-long-delayed-pardon.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=19 November 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1788 and 1840, 80,000 English convicts were transported to New South Wales, with the greatest numbers coming between 1825 and 1835. The [[New South Wales]] Census of 1846 accounted for 57,349 born in England.

From the beginning of the [[History of Australia (1788-1850)|colonial era]] until the mid-20th century, the vast majority of settlers to Australia were from the [[British Isles]], with the English being the dominant group, followed by the Irish and Scottish. Among the leading ancestries, increases in Australian, Irish, and German ancestries and decreases in English, Scottish, and Welsh ancestries appear to reflect such shifts in perception or reporting. These reporting shifts at least partly resulted from changes in the design of the census question, in particular the introduction of a tick box format in 2001.&lt;ref name="abs.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/7d12b0f6763c78caca257061001cc588/af5129cb50e07099ca2570eb0082e462!OpenDocument|title=Chapter - Population characteristics: Ancestry of Australia's population|first=c=AU; o=Commonwealth of Australia; ou=Australian Bureau of|last=Statistics|website=Abs.gov.au|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1859, 2.2 million (73%) of the free settlers who immigrated were British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancestryeurope.lu/press/press-releases/uk/2008/06/historical-records-reveal-oz-ancestors-of-16-million-brits/|title=Ancestry Information Operations Unlimited Company - Press Releases|website=Ancestryeurope.lu|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Australians]] of English descent, are both the single largest ethnic group in [[Australia]] and the largest 'ancestry' identity in the Australian census.&lt;ref name="Census2016-036"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/036 |title=Census 2016: Summary of result – Population by states and territories, 2011 and 2016 Census |work=Australian Bureau of Statistics |publisher=Australian Government |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[2016 Australian census|2016 census]], 7.8 million or 25.0% of respondents identified as "English" or a combination including English, a numerical increase from 7.2 million over the 2011 census figure. The census also documented 907,572 residents or 3.9% of Australia as being born in [[England]], and are the largest overseas-born population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/036?opendocument 2016 Census QuickStats] - Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

English migrants and English Australians were by far the single most influential ethnic group in colonial Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, Mike, and David Mayall, eds.

From 1840 the English comprised the largest single group among New Zealand’s overseas-born, consistently being over 50 percent, sometimes 60 percent of those who were born in the United Kingdom and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YFF8ynVL4wIC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=new+zealand+foundational+culture+was+english&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qCN8bUJl_S&amp;sig=1ksHUWS7bgnOBV7Oz2j66xHiWzk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiou-eus6nbAhWIthQKHZszA_sQ6AEwA3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20zealand%20foundational%20culture%20was%20english&amp;f=false Locating the English Diaspora], 1500-2010 - edited by Tanja Bueltmann, David T. Gleeson, Donald M. MacRaild&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite their prominence as migrants, at no point after the early 1850s did the [[England|English]]-born constitute a majority of the colonial population. In the [[1851 New Zealand census|1851 Census]] 54.8% of the total population were born in England, this proportion fell to 36.5% (1861) and 24.3% by 1881.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nNTCAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA243&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;dq=locating+new+zealand's+english+diaspora&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=21Gh3OWeYf&amp;sig=xfvaM2XIKFUqrfzgMKjr7Wepkxo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjur4mI4KfTAhXJ0RQKHQuCCEcQ6AEIMTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=locating%20new%20zealand's%20english%20diaspora&amp;f=false Loyalism and the Formation of the British World], 1775-1914 edited by Allan Blackstock, Frank O'Gorman&lt;/ref&gt; In the most recent Census in 2013, there were 215,589 English-born representing 21.5% of all overseas-born residents or around 5 percent of the total population and is still the most-common birthplace outside New Zealand.

[[James Cook]] claimed New Zealand for Britain on his arrival in 1769. The establishment of British colonies in Australia from 1788 and the boom in whaling and sealing in the Southern Ocean brought many Europeans to the vicinity of New Zealand. By 1830 there was a population of about 800 non Māori which included a total of about 200 runaway convicts and seamen. The seamen often lived in New Zealand for a short time before joining another ship a few months later. In 1839 there were 1100 Europeans living in the North Island. 
The [[Canterbury Association]] was founded in [[London]] on 27 March 1848 and incorporated by Royal Charter on 13 November 1849. They recruited settlers from the south of England, creating a definite English influence over that region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://teara.govt.nz/en/history-of-immigration/page-4|title = History of immigration - The immigrants: 1840 to 1852|website =Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|first = Jock|last = Phillips|date = 1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s most migrants settled in the South Island due to gold discoveries and the availability of flat grass covered land for pastoral farming.

==Europe==
===Ireland===
{{main|Anglo-Irish people}}
[[Plantations of Ireland|Plantations in 16th- and 17th-century Ireland]] were the confiscation of land by the [[English crown]] and the [[colonisation]] of this land with settlers from England (particularly the Border Counties) and the [[Scottish Lowlands]]. They followed smaller-scale immigration to Ireland as far back as the 12th century, which had resulted in a distinct ethnicity in Ireland known as the [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]].

The 16th-century plantations were established throughout the country by the confiscation of lands occupied by [[Gael]]ic clans and [[Hiberno-Norman]] dynasties, but principally in the [[Provinces of Ireland|provinces]] of [[Munster]] and [[Ulster]]. The Crown granted these lands to colonists ("planters") from [[Kingdom of England|England]]. This process began during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and continued under [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. It was accelerated under [[James I of England|James I]], [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[Oliver Cromwell]]; in their time, land was also granted to Scottish planters.

The early [[Plantation (settlement or colony)|plantations]] in the 16th century tended to be based on small "exemplary" colonies. The later plantations were based on mass confiscations of land from Irish landowners and the subsequent importation of numerous settlers and labourers from [[England and Wales]], and later from Scotland.
The final official plantations were established under the [[English Commonwealth]] and Cromwell's [[The Protectorate|Protectorate]] during the 1650s, when thousands of [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] soldiers were settled in Ireland. Apart from the plantations, significant immigration into Ireland continued well into the 18th century, from both [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[continental Europe]].
The plantations changed the [[demography of Ireland]] by creating large communities with a British and [[Protestant]] identity.

'''Food or drink competitions''' reward products primarily for their "gustative worth" in the form of an award or a medal. These competitions can be classified into different categories, and most awards are product-specific, such as for wines, beers, and cheeses. Others focus on local, regional and/or national products. Finally, the international competitions test all kinds of foods and drinks available to consumers on a retail basis. Wine is probably the most tested drink, followed by beer and spirits.

There is a variety of such food and drink competitions worldwide, where the taste and quality of products are assessed. Most evaluations are carried out blind, sometimes complemented by laboratory analysis. The jury usually consists of a panel of different types of "experts" in tastings such as chefs or [[sommelier]]s. 

The history of degustation tests is unclear; however, one of the earliest taste awards recorded for drinks is the [[Brewing Industry International Awards]], dating back to 1888.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brewingawards.org/articles_30_competition-history_2_awards.html Brewing Awards - Welcome to the International Brewing Awards&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; For food, [[Monde Selection]] is the oldest award recorded, first run in 1961. Since then, as the variety of food products on the market has grown, so has the number of competitions and evaluations.

Monde Selection states that "This bronze, silver, gold or grand gold quality label can be compared to the quality stars of a hotel or those of the [[Michelin Guide]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monde-selection.com/en/1.0_Activities_and_Awards/1.1_Our_Mission/1.1_Our_Mission.asp |title=Monde Selection : Our Mission |date= |accessdate=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, whilst both processes are anonymous, Michelin chooses the hotels and restaurants it reviews and pays for everything. Only products who pay the Euro 1,100 entry fee are reviewed by Monde Selection. Unlike [[Olympic medal|Olympic gold, silver and bronze medals]], where only one of each is awarded per event, there are no limits to how many can be awarded in each category. Other competitions use a similar business model.

Most awarding organizations charge an entry fee. Alternatively, for some awards, producers or retailers pay a fee only if their products are awarded and/or they decide to communicate about the award (payment for the right to show the award on packaging).&lt;ref&gt;http://download.dlg.org/pdf/bier/DLG-Test_Bier07.pdf2 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819190203/http://download.dlg.org/pdf/bier/DLG-Test_Bier07.pdf |date=2008-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In both cases, one might think that these recognitions can be bought. However, tastings are carried out independently and are blind-tested, where judges focus exclusively on sensory ([[organoleptic]]) features, such as taste, olfaction, vision, aspect, mouth-feel, after-taste, without being influenced by packaging, branding or marketing. Of course, only producers who pay the entry fee can make use of any award made.

'''''Frisbee''''', is a public artwork by [[United States|American]] artist [[Patrick Villiers Farrow]], located on the [[Middlebury College]] campus center green, in front of [[List of Middlebury College buildings|Monroe Hall]] in [[Middlebury, Vermont]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Andres&gt;{{cite web |last1=Andres |first1=Glenn |last2=Callahan |first2=Anne |title=A Walking History of Middlebury |url=http://midddigital.middlebury.edu/walking_history/college_campus/page_1.html |publisher=The Henry Sheldon Museum of Vermont History |accessdate=2 October 2018 |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall dimensions of this [[bronze]] sculpture are  {{convert|68|in|cm}} tall, {{convert|28|in|cm}} long, and {{convert|36|in|cm}} wide. It is attached to an underground concrete foundation. The sculpture was cast by Agros Art Casting Foundry, [[Brewster, New York]] and dedicated in 1989.

==Description==
''Frisbee'' depicts a dog leaping into the air, with three legs off the ground, catching a disc in its mouth. The dog's left hind leg is on the ground and its head is turned to the right.

The sculpture is signed by the artist on the underside of the disc along the rim, "©1989 Patrick Villiers Farrow". The founder's mark appears just after the artist's signature. An inscription, "Frisbee A Gift to Middlebury College from Gary Merrill" is also noted on the underside of the disc, along the rim. Inscribed on the raised rear paw on the toe pads are the names "Matthew" and "Cameron". The names refer to the donor's grandsons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!309404~!0#focus| title= Inventories of American Painting and Sculpture, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Inventory Number IAS VT000001| accessdate= March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information==
Although who was truly first played frisbee is disputed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.middlebury.edu/arts/campus/artexhib/patrick_farrow_frisbee_dog| title= Patrick Villiers Farrow (American, born 1942) ''Frisbee Dog'', 1989| publisher= middlebury.edu| accessdate= March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; five members of the Middlebury College [[Delta Upsilon]] fraternity claim to have been the first to toss empty Frisbie Pie Company plates to each other while traveling through Nebraska in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/09/style/campus-life-middlebury-it-all-started-with-pie-tins-in-the-air.html?scp=1&amp;sq=frisbee%20sculpture%20Middlebury&amp;st=cse |title= CAMPUS LIFE: Middlebury; It all Started With Pie Tins In the Air| author= Donna Light| date= July 9, 1989| work= The New York Times| accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture commemorates the college's assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1899&amp;dat=19890524&amp;id=Iv8hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sGkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3143,3236482| title= Statue commemorates the first Frisbee| author= Danica Kirka| date = May 24, 1989| publisher= The Lewiston Journal| accessdate= March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of playing [[frisbee]] on campus greens continues at Middlebury informally as well as through organized [[ultimate (sport)]] teams, the Middlebury Pranksters.

===Acquisition===
The sculpture was a gift to Middlebury College from Gary Merrill. The sculpture is maintained by the Middlebury College Museum of Art through the college's Committee on Art in Public Places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.middlebury.edu/arts/campus/mission| title= Public Art on Campus: CAPP's Mission| publisher= middlebury.edu| accessdate= March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist==
Self-taught artist Patrick Villiers Farrow (1942–2009) was one of seven children born to actress [[Maureen O'Sullivan]] and film director [[John Farrow]]. Patrick Farrow moved to [[Vermont]] in 1964. Working in bronze and steel, his first solo exhibition was in [[Beverly Hills, California]] in 1967 and he became a Fellow of the [[National Sculpture Society]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://patrickfarrow.com/biography.html|title=Patrick Villiers Farrow biography | work=patrickfarrow.com|accessdate= March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Documentation ==
This sculpture was documented in 1992 as part of [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]], a campaign organized by Heritage Preservation: The National Institute of Conservation partnered with the [[Smithsonian Institution]], specifically the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]. Throughout the 1990s, over 7,000 volunteers cataloged and assessed the condition of over 30,000 publicly accessible statues, monuments, and sculptures installed as outdoor public art across the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heritagepreservation.org/Programs/Sos/aboutsos.htm |title=About SOS! |author= |year=2009 |work= |publisher=heritagepreservation.org |accessdate=March 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108041805/http://www.heritagepreservation.org/Programs/SOS/aboutsos.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Vermont, the survey was sponsored by the Vermont Museum and Gallery Alliance from 1992-1993 where 110 volunteers surveyed 242 sculptures dating from 1740 to 1993. The archives from the project are maintained by the [[Vermont Historical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.vermonthistory.org/vhsweb2/tramp2.exe/form/A09gcmo9.000 |title= Record for Doc 320 Finding Aid for Save Outdoor Sculpture!

In 1945 in the [[New Mexico]] desert, American scientists conducted "[[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]]," the first [[nuclear weapons test]], marking the beginning of the [[atomic age]].&lt;ref name=pal/&gt; Even before the Trinity test, national leaders debated the impact of nuclear weapons on domestic and foreign policy. Also involved in the debate about nuclear weapons policy was the scientific community, through professional associations such as the [[Federation of Atomic Scientists]] and the [[Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs]].&lt;ref name=brow/&gt;

On August 6, 1945, towards the end of [[World War II]], the [[Little Boy]] device was detonated over the [[Japan]]ese military city of [[Hiroshima]]. Exploding with a yield equivalent to 12,500&amp;nbsp;tonnes of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly 50,000 buildings (including the [[headquarters]] of the [[Second General Army (Japan)|2nd General Army]] and [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Fifth Division]]) and killed approximately 75,000 people, among them 20,000 Japanese soldiers and 20,000 Korean slave laborers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |year=2001 |chapter=Uranium |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A to Z Guide to the Elements |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford]] |isbn=0-19-850340-7 |authorlink=John Emsley |first=John |last=Emsley |pages=478 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Detonation of the [[Fat Man]] device exploded over the Japanese industrial city of [[Nagasaki]] three days later after Hiroshima, destroying 60% of the city and killing approximately 35,000 people, among them 23,200-28,200 Japanese munitions workers, 2,000 Korean slave laborers, and 150 Japanese soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nuke-Rebuke: Writers &amp; Artists Against Nuclear Energy &amp; Weapons (The Contemporary anthology series) |pages=22–29 |date=May 1, 1984 |publisher=The Spirit That Moves Us Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two bombings remains the only events where nuclear weapons have been used in [[combat]].

[[Operation Crossroads]] was a series of [[nuclear weapon]] tests conducted by the [[United States and nuclear weapons|United States]] at [[Bikini Atoll]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the summer of 1946. Its purpose was to test the effect of nuclear weapons on naval ships. Pressure to cancel Operation Crossroads came from scientists and diplomats. [[Manhattan Project]] scientists argued that further nuclear testing was unnecessary and environmentally dangerous. A Los Alamos study warned "the water near a recent surface explosion will be a witch's brew" of radioactivity. To prepare the atoll for the nuclear tests, Bikini's native residents were evicted from their homes and resettled on smaller, uninhabited islands where they were unable to sustain themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing was first drawn to public attention in 1954 when a Hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific contaminated the crew of the Japanese fishing boat ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru|Lucky Dragon]]''.&lt;ref name=rudig2/&gt; One of the fishermen died in Japan seven months later. The incident caused widespread concern around the world and "provided a decisive impetus for the emergence of the anti-nuclear weapons movement in many countries".&lt;ref name=rudig2&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-nuclear weapons movement grew rapidly because for many people the atomic bomb "encapsulated the very worst direction in which society was moving".&lt;ref name=falkj&gt;Jim Falk (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, pp. 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peace movements emerged in Japan and in 1954 they converged to form a unified "Japanese Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs". Japanese opposition to the Pacific nuclear weapons tests was widespread, and "an estimated 35 million signatures were collected on petitions calling for bans on nuclear weapons".&lt;ref name=falkj/&gt;

German publications of the 1950s and 1960s contained criticism of some features of nuclear power including its safety. Nuclear waste disposal was widely recognized as a major problem, with concern publicly expressed as early as 1954. In 1964, one author went so far as to state "that the dangers and costs of the necessary final disposal of nuclear waste could possibly make it necessary to forego the development of nuclear energy".&lt;ref name=wolf&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russell–Einstein Manifesto]] was issued in [[London]] on July 9, 1955 by [[Bertrand Russell]] in the midst of the [[Cold War]]. It highlighted the dangers posed by [[nuclear weapons]] and called for world leaders to seek peaceful resolutions to international conflict. The signatories included eleven pre-eminent intellectuals and scientists, including [[Albert Einstein]], who signed it just days before his death on April 18, 1955. A few days after the release, philanthropist [[Cyrus S. Eaton]] offered to sponsor a conference—called for in the manifesto—in [[Pugwash, Nova Scotia]], Eaton's birthplace. This conference was to be the first of the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]], held in July 1957.

In the United Kingdom, the first [[Aldermaston Marches|Aldermaston March]] organised by the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] took place at [[Easter]] 1958, when several thousand people marched for four days from [[Trafalgar Square]], London, to the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] close to [[Aldermaston]] in [[Berkshire]], England, to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=CND&gt;[http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/hist.html A brief history of CND]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianUnlimited:1958&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[Guardian Unlimited]] | title = Early defections in march to Aldermaston | date = 1958-04-05 | url = http://century.guardian.co.uk/1950-1959/Story/0,,105488,00.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aldermaston marches continued into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day marches.&lt;ref name=falkj/&gt;

In 1959, a letter in the ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'' was the start of a successful campaign to stop the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] dumping [[radioactive waste]] in the sea 19 kilometres from [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Falk (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 1961, at the height of the [[Cold War]], about 50,000 women brought together by [[Women Strike for Peace]] marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against [[nuclear weapons]].

In 1958, Linus Pauling and his wife presented the United Nations with the petition signed by more than 11,000 scientists calling for an end to [[nuclear testing|nuclear-weapon testing]]. The "[[Baby Tooth Survey]]," headed by Dr [[Louise Reiss]], demonstrated conclusively in 1961 that above-ground nuclear testing posed significant public health risks in the form of [[nuclear fallout|radioactive fallout]] spread primarily via milk from cows that had ingested contaminated grass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/134/3491/1669.pdf | title=Strontium-90 Absorption by Deciduous Teeth: Analysis of teeth provides a practicable method of monitoring strontium-90 uptake by human populations | accessdate=October 13, 2009 | author=Louise Zibold Reiss | date=November 24, 1961 | publisher=Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/peace/narrative/page26.html | title=Strontium-90 | accessdate=December 13, 2007 | author=Thomas Hager | date=November 29, 2007 | publisher=Oregon State University Libraries Special Collections }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/peace/narrative/page27.html | title=The Right to Petition | accessdate=December 13, 2007 | author=Thomas Hager | date=November 29, 2007 | publisher=Oregon State University Libraries Special Collections }}&lt;/ref&gt; Public pressure and the research results subsequently led to a moratorium on above-ground nuclear weapons testing, followed by the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]], signed in 1963 by [[John F.

In 1966, [[Larry Bogart]] founded the [[List of anti-nuclear groups in the United States#Citizens Energy Council|Citizens Energy Council]], a coalition of environmental groups that published the newsletters "Radiation Perils," "Watch on the A.E.C." and "Nuclear Opponents".

The emergence of the anti-nuclear power movement was "closely associated with the general rise in environmental consciousness which had started to materialize in the USA in the 1960s and quickly spread to other Western industrialized countries".&lt;ref name=rudig/&gt; Some nuclear experts began to voice dissenting views about nuclear power in 1969, and this was a necessary precondition for broad public concern about nuclear power to emerge.&lt;ref name=rudig&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; These scientists included [[Ernest Sternglass]] from Pittsburg, [[Henry Way Kendall|Henry Kendall]] from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Nobel laureate [[George Wald]] and radiation specialist [[Rosalie Bertell]]. These members of the scientific community "by expressing their concern over nuclear power, played a crucial role in demystifying the issue for other citizens", and nuclear power became an issue of major public protest in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=rudig/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jim Falk (1982).

Also in 1971, the town of [[Wyhl]], in Germany, was a proposed site for a nuclear power station. In the years that followed, public opposition steadily mounted, and there were large protests.

The migrant community has often been a source of contention between the two countries; according to available reports, the [[lakh]]s of Indians illegally staying in the country hailed from the Indian states of [[West Bengal]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Assam]], [[Tripura]] and [[Mizoram]] and were spread across numerous urban and rural areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Refugee ==
On July 2016, four thousand Indians took refuge in [[Lalmonirhat District|Lalmonirhat]], Bangladesh after floods in [[West Bengal]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/flood-affected-indians-take-shelter-bangladesh-1259998|title=Flood-affected Indians take shelter in Bangladesh|date=2016-07-27|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-04-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[interpersonal communication]] that occurs during a [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] deterioration/dissolution looks to explain the possible "why" behind the relationship [[breakup]] and the communication steps that a breakup seems to follow. Studies have looked at the predictors of breakups, the breakup process, the strategies employed, the impact of the breakups, and finally the process to move on emotionally from the broken relationship.

==Definition==
Relationship dissolution "refers to the process of the breaking up of relationships (friendship, romantic, or marital relationships) by the voluntary activity of at least one partner." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battaglia|first=D.M.|date=1998|title=Breaking Up is (Relatively) Easy to Do: A Script of the Dissolution of Close Relationships|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-03063-007|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|volume=15|pages=829–845|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;This article examines two types of relationship dissolution, the non-marital breakup and the [[Marital breakdown|marital breakup]]. The differences are how they are experienced, how they must be studied and how they might survive. Nonmarital breakups help us understand the nature of the issues involved and the patterns of [[grief]] experienced, they are meaningful to both persons, creating crisis in [[intimacy]], [[Personal development|personal]] and [[social development]] and future [[Promise|commitment]] expectations. Surviving a nonmarital breakup provides the opportunity to self-discovery, [[generosity]], [[dignity]] and nobility of grief, and the promise of recovery (Weber, 1992). In marital breakups, more negotiation and delayed dissolution may occur because of the presence of children (Johnson, 1982) called a barrier force. Not all breakups should be considered a "failure", because they didn't last long enough or hit yearly marks as dictated by society. Some breakups may serve a distinct, positive change for one of the partners if there is [[abuse]] or other negative factors in the relationship.

==Breakup factors==
No relationship is established with the thought that it will end with [[love sickness|heartache]] and grief, at least experienced by one of the couple. Why do we bother if the common belief is that at least 50% or more marriages end in [[divorce]]? Jones &amp; Burdette, 1994, state in their work that we face two daunting risks when we pursue an [[intimate relationship]] with another: [[Social rejection|rejection]] and [[betrayal]]. This is countered with our social need to belong which usually trumps the risks. Hill, Rubin, and Peplau conducted a study in 1976 where 231 heterosexual couples agreed to complete a [[questionnaire]] about their relationship for two years. Only 128 couples survived the two years together, but it was the information gathered from the 103 couples that provided substantial information on  breakup factors.

===Predictors===
* Dissimilarity among the couples in age, [[education]], and [[physical attraction]]
* Those who said they "loved" each other stayed together compared to those who simply "liked" each other

===Process===
Hill et al. (1976) found that the peak season for a breakup is when there are changes in one's life, which may force the relationship to be examined as to whether it can be sustained over time, distance, or other change in [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. Women were more likely to be the initiators of change.

===Impact===
* Men were hit harder by the breakup than the women in the Hill et al. study (1976), they felt more depressed, lonely, unhappy, less free—but less guilty
* Women were less clingy and sentimental, and more pragmatic about the future of the relationship and how it would impact their lives—they had more at stake in finding the right partner

==Duck's topographical model==
[[Steve Duck]] (1981) developed a topographical model of relationship disengagement and dissolution, whether married or not, in which he outlined four models of dissolution: pre-existing doom, mechanical failure, process loss and sudden death.

===Pre-existing doom===
* Couples who are badly  matched from the start, no matter what the [[initiation]] action involved, it could not overcome personal differences

===Mechanical failure===
* When things break, where [[communication]] may be poor or [[Social interaction|interaction]]s go badly. Without communication a relationship will never survive.

===Process loss===
* Relationships that die because they do not reach their potential, albeit a slow death, because of poor [[productivity]] or communication on one or both of the members of the dyad

===Sudden death===
New information on a partner can produce sudden death of the new relationship with a [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] violation. Davis (1973) described three conditions that produce "sudden death" in a relationship: two-sided [[subsidence]], in which both members of the couple maintain a formal relationship with no intimacy; one-sided subsidence, where one partner is dependent and hangs on, while the other actively seeks to end the relationship; and zero-sided subsidence which is an abrupt ending primarily brought on by outside factors that makes retreat or repair impossible.

==Breakup strategies==
There are at least fifteen strategies used to terminate relationships and are set apart by whether they are unilateral or bilateral and indirect or direct (Baxter, 1982, 1984).

===Unilateral and indirect===
* Withdrawal of [[moral support|supportiveness]] and [[affection]]
* Pseudo de-escalation – purports that the relationship will benefit by [[Legal separation|separation]]
* Cost escalation – attempts to make the relationship unattractive to the partner
* Relational ruses – leaking an impending breakup to a friend or third party
* Avoidance behaviors|Avoidance – from complete evasion to decreased contact

===Unilateral and direct===
* The direct dump – simple statement that the relationship is over
* Dates with other people
* Justification – explanation why the relationship is ending
* The relationship talk trick – talking about "problems"
* Threats and [[bullying]]
* Positive tone – painting the picture that "it's nobody's fault, it's just over"
* De-escalation – breaking up to see if the relationship endures

===Bilateral and indirect===
* Fadeaway – both people in the relationship grow apart

===Bilateral and direct===
* The blame game – both partners dissatisfied and blaming each other
* Negotiated farewell – realize problems cannot be solved and negotiate breakup

==Duck's Stages of dissolution==
[[Steve Duck]]'s (1982) four stages of relationship dissolution, each very distinctive with specific components, are moved through once one or both of the partners have crossed a cognitive threshold.

===Intrapsychic stage===
[[Intrapsychic]] stage begins with one partner who is dissatisfied and secretively searches for a way to "fix" the relationship. Vaughan (1986) states that uncoupling begins with a [[secret]], and Duck asserts that the secret of [[unhappiness]] is kept that way through the intrapsychic stage.

===Dyadic stage===
[[Dyad (sociology)|Dyad]]ic stage where the dissatisfied partner decides to fix the problem by confronting the other partner, thus entering into uncharted territory. This may not fix what is wrong and just continue to draw out the relationship until the unhappy partner becomes determined to depart, which will move the relationship into the next phase.

===Social stage===
Social stage is when the partners devise their accounts of how the breakup happened and how they will present it to their [[social circle]]s. If it is in fact the end, they will cross over into the final phase of relationship dissolution.

===Grave-dressing stage===
Grave-dressing stage is simply the "attempt to bury and describe the relationship" stage. Partners now create an acceptable story about their love and loss, do whatever cognitive work, including [[introspection]], [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]], [[rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]], and reassessment of self and other, which is necessary in order to get over the deceased relationship.

==Modification of Duck's Stage Model==
Stephanie Rollie and [[Steve Duck]] (2006) subsequently modified the original model after a critique of stage models that appear to suppose an orderly and relatively conscious progression through the above stages. Proposing instead five phases of breakdown, Rollie and Duck added a Resurrection Phase which was placed after "Grave Dressing" and represented the period of reconfiguration of self and preparation for new relationships.  In the modified proposal, the authors articulated changes to communication patterns and topics that would typify each phase, but clarified that the result of the communication could at any time be not simply progression to the next phase of break up but reversion to an earlier state of the relationship.

==Grief==

===Experience===
Harvey (1996) explains that when you experience a [[Grief|loss]] or a depletion of resources, you may need some time to sort out what you had in the first place, what was given up in the breakup, and what remains for you to rely on, cherish or use. Grief is not a passive experience but a series of active choices for the grieving person to confront and resolve in either the direction of [[healing]] or prolonged suffering (Neeld, 1990).

===Four central tasks of grief===
Weber (1998) outlines the following central tasks for dealing with grief.
# Express your emotions. Expressing [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]] and [[Rage (emotion)|rage]] is one of the central tasks of grief (Leick &amp; Davidsen-Nielsen, 1990). Whether you express it to a sympathetic friend or write down your feelings and thoughts in a journal (Pennebaker, 1990) which can bring long-term benefits, such as greater well-being and emotional recovery.
# What happened? Figuring out what happened by doing the cognitive work to review the relationship but also accept the reasons for the failure. Survivors of a broken relationship should write their own story on what happened (Kingma, 1987) which will provide some [[emotional release]] and a way to cope with the situation. All this is done to provide some closure to the experience.
# Realize, don't idealize. Use various strategies to lessen the pain of the breakup. One strategy is the silent [[ridicule]] where the one left behind imagines a flaw in the other partner and mentally exaggerates it to the point of [[humor]] (Phillips &amp; Judd, 1978). Once the person is seen as human with flaws, it's easier to leave him or her behind.
# Prepare to feel better. If there was a sense that something was wrong for a period of time, it can create a sense of relief when the other shoe finally drops. If the person left can get to the point of laughter over the situation, the [[healing process]] will break the bonds of misery since it's incompatible with self-imposed [[mourning]] (Frankel &amp; Tien, 1993). Look for what was actually funny about the relationship which in turn can accelerate the process of healing.

[[File:PAK88 koukashitakabedondanjyo20140301500.jpg|thumb|Kabedon, as seen in a Japanese movie]]
'''Kabedon''' or '''Kabe-Don''' ({{lang-ja|壁ドン}}; ''Kabe'', "wall", and ''Don'', "bang") refers to the action of slapping a wall fiercely, which produces the sound "don". One meaning is the action of slapping the [[wall]] as a [[protest]] which occurs in collective housing like [[condominium]]s when the next room makes noise.&lt;ref name="BrianAshcraft07042014"&gt;[http://kotaku.com/manga-trope-appears-in-noodle-commercial-confuses-some-1600201827 Manga Trope Appears in Noodle Commercial, Confuses Some People]&lt;/ref&gt; Another meaning often appears in [[shōjo manga]] or [[anime]] when a man forces a woman against the wall with one hand or leans against the wall and makes the sound of "don", and this has become popular as a "clever move of confession".&lt;ref name="ayaya09112014"&gt;[http://tokyogirlsupdate.com/kabe-don-cafe-experience-20141130159.html Feeling Exhilaration, Even Through a Mistake: Experiencing the "Kabe-Don" Japanese Girls Love So Much]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KKmiller13032015"&gt;[http://en.rocketnews24.com/2015/03/13/would-kabe-don-work-outside-of-japan%E3%80%90video%E3%80%91/ Would kabe-don work outside of Japan?【Video】]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==

=== Love affairs ===
In Japan, Kabedon mainly appears in plots of girls' manga or anime when a man forces the woman against the wall; at the same time, his hand slaps the wall and surrounds the woman, and the sound of "don" is produced.&lt;ref name="robo"&gt;[http://www.wowjpn.com/1966 Move Over Udon and Gyudon : It's Time For "Kabe-Don" !!]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frustrations with accommodation ===
In Japan, the walls of many accommodation buildings are thin and not insulated against sound. As such, simple actions like closing a door or turning on the television can easily be heard by neighbors. When this noise becomes too loud to bear, Japanese people tend to bang their connecting walls in protest.

== Origin and status quo ==
Kabedon first appeared in 2008 when [[voice actor]] [[Ryōko Shintani]] described it as "lovely situation". Since then, it has also been used in the [[shōjo manga]] ''[[L DK]]'' by the author [[Watanabe Ayu]]; and in April 2014, the manga was adapted into a live-action film. Afterwards, the term started to become familiar to the public and often appears in girls' manga, and is also widely popular among female high school students.

The '''rivalry between [[King's College London]] and [[University College London]]''' has been a part of London life for nearly two centuries.&lt;ref name=rivalryuol&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.kingscollections.org/exhibitions/archives/mayhem/origins/histories | title=Origins of the Colleges' Contrasting Histories | accessdate=14 January 2013 | publisher=King's College London | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been expressed in the academic sphere, on the sports field and in the rivalry of the student populations. It can be traced to their foundation in the 1820s when King's College was established as the [[Anglican]] counterpart to the secular University College.

== Origins ==

King's College was founded in 1829 in response to the founding of "London University", latterly known as University College London, in 1826. UCL was founded, with the backing of Jews, Utilitarians and non-Anglican Christians, as a secular institution, intended to educate "the youth of our middling rich people between the ages of 15 or 16 and 20 or later". The principal objective of King's College was "to imbue the minds of youth with a knowledge of the doctrines and duties of Christianity, as inculcated by the United Church of England and Ireland". At King's, attendance at college chapel and the study of Christianity formed an important part of college life.

[[Image:Strand102.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Embankment terrace, King's College London]]
[[Image:UCL Portico Building.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Portico building, University College London]]

The rivalry can be glimpsed in the second verse of an 1820s satirical song set to the music of the [[God Save the Queen|British national anthem]]:&lt;ref name=rivalryuol/&gt;

:''King's College lads arise!''
:''New Universities''
:''Shall quickly fall;''
:''Confound their politics,''
:''Frustrate their teaching tricks,''
:''O, Church! on thee we fix,''
:''Maintain us all''

One of the earliest potentially violent consequences of the contrasting styles and purposes of the two colleges arose when the [[George Finch-Hatton, 10th Earl of Winchilsea|Earl of Winchilsea]], one of the principal financial donors to the fledgling King's College, accused its leading patron, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], of seeking to water down the orthodox, Protestant, character of the new College.&lt;ref name=rivalryuol/&gt;

Wellington had recently played a central role in securing [[Catholic Emancipation]] and Winchilsea, an opponent of emancipation, feared that he planned to turn King's College London into a 'Catholic Seminary' as the new college was to place no religious test for entry. Early in 1829 Winchilsea publicly challenged Wellington about the Duke's simultaneous support for the Anglican King's College and the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]]. The result was a duel in Battersea Fields on 21 March. Shots were fired but no-one was hurt. Duel Day is still celebrated annually at King's in March.&lt;ref name=duelday&gt;{{citation|url=https://alumni.kcl.ac.uk/sslpage.aspx?pid=786 | title=Duel Day Celebrations 2011 | publisher=King's College London |accessdate=14 January 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duelqa"&gt;{{citation|url=http://alumni.kcl.ac.uk/Document.Doc?id=41 | title=Duel Day – Questions and Answers| publisher=King's College London | accessdate=14 January 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Student Rags ==
{{Main|Rag (student society)}}

Student Rags were manifestations of the rivalry between the two institutions and first became popular in the late nineteenth century. Student rags often featured cross-dressing and processions that mirrored official celebrations as a way of challenging authority whilst raising money for charity. Rags were "colourful, subversive, and occasionally dangerous" for both participants and bystanders and reached their height between the two [[World War]]s.&lt;ref name="colourful"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.kingscollections.org/exhibitions/archives/mayhem/origins/histories |title=Mayhem in the Metropolis | publisher= King's College London |accessdate=14 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A long-running campaign of the rags were the attempts to capture each other's [[mascot]]s. Running battles were supposedly brought to an end by the colleges' authorities in the first half of the twentieth century, but rivalry amongst the University of London's colleges continues to this day.

Early student social activity in London tended to be quite serious and worthy in its expression, characterised by programmes of lectures, debates and sporting fixtures. However, this began to change by the 1890s, which witnessed boisterous '[[Town and Gown]]' antics by students which continued into Edwardian times.

The first real rag at King's occurred in 1912. Angry student anti-vivisectionists [[Brown Dog affair|complained that a small dog had been vivisected repeatedly and unnecessarily]] and erected a statue of the animal in Battersea Park. Indignant students from London medical schools quickly moved to destroy the statue, in the course of which a struggle took place with police and some students arrested and fined. They later reconvened in the King's quad with an effigy of the offending magistrate that was set on fire and thrown into the river.

The First World War for some constituted a cultural watershed in attitudes to established authority. Many members of staff and students of British universities saw active service and the experience of the veteran undoubtedly influenced the progress of the student rag after the war. The rags of the 1920s were well attended and often organised with military precision. They received considerable press coverage not least for their impact on local communities

[[Edith Summerskill]], medical student at King's in the 1920s and later [[Minister of National Insurance]], reflecting on the contrast between the informal behaviour of her contemporaries with the more serious post-1945 student, observed that, "We were all too busy relaxing after the war, gayer, more high spirited and after a good time', going on to suggest that 'the 1914–18 war was far more terrible than this last war ... consequently the reaction after the war was more marked."&lt;ref name="Women politics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/cawp/UK%20bios/UK_bios_30s.htm|title=Centre for Advancement of Women in Politics|accessdate=23 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== College mascots ===

[[Image:Reggiethelion.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Reggie the Lion – King's Mascot]]
Rivalry in the twentieth century between students of the two colleges was centred on their respective [[mascot]]s. University College's was Phineas Maclino, a wooden [[tobacconist]]'s sign of a kilted Jacobite [[Gàidhealtachd|Highlander]] purloined from outside a shop in [[Tottenham Court Road]] during the celebrations of the [[Relief of Ladysmith]] in 1900.

King's later addition was a giant [[beer bottle]] representing "bottled youth". In December 1923 it was replaced by a new mascot to rival Phineas – [[King's College London Students' Union#Mascot|Reggie the Lion]], a copper lion from a junkyard (also off [[Tottenham Court Road]]) for whom King's students paid £7, that was christened Reggie at a special meeting. Reggie made his debut at a King's-UCL sporting rag in December 1923, protected by a lifeguard of engineering students armed with [[T-square]]s. Thereafter, Reggie formed the centrepiece of annual [[fresher]]s' processions by King's students around [[Aldwych]].

=== Kidnappings ===

Reggie was the victim of repeated kidnapping attempts by UCL and other London colleges following the [[Second World War]]. On one occasion he was transported to [[Inverness]] and on another was ignominiously dumped at the [[Surrey]] beauty spot of the [[Devil's Punchbowl]]. The most notable episode involved his painful emasculation by UCL students armed with a tin opener. Thankfully, he was restored to full working order by a team of engineers and medics and filled with concrete to prevent further kidnap attempts by the [[Bloomsbury]] students. Likewise, UCL mascots have been kidnapped over the years, with the tarring and feathering of Phineas and the infamous theft of preserved Jeremy Bentham's head. Mascot theft has since died down with both university's mascots more securely protected.

==1919–1938: Heyday of the rag==

The [[Interwar period]] witnessed the flourishing of the student rag and of the friendly rivalry between King's and UCL. College [[Student unionism in the United Kingdom|union societies]] greatly expanded their sporting, social and charitable activities at this time and in 1921 the [[University of London Union]] Society was formed as an umbrella organisation. Rags comprised well-organised kidnappings, the collection for charity by students dressed as the opposite sex or in elaborate costumes, processions and mock battles.

===Great rag of 1922===
The contest between King's and UCL reached new levels in December 1922 when King's captured Phineas from his usual residence in [[Tottenham Court Road]]. When King's ignored an ultimatum demanding his return, hundreds of UCL students, transported in furniture vans from [[Bloomsbury]] or arriving at [[Aldwych tube station]], stormed the King's [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quad]].

King's was defended by the college gun, re-equipped with a powerful hose pipe, whilst Phineas stood on the college's main steps with a personal bodyguard of engineering students armed with rotten fruit and vegetables from the nearby [[Covent Garden Market]]. Having taken the precaution to switch off the college's water supply at the mains, UCL students engaged their rivals resulting in several injuries and the collapse of part of a King's College stone [[balustrade]]. Police were called and a truce was enforced.

UCL and King's students then marched back to [[Gower Street, London|Gower Street]] in good spirits accompanied by the battered but dignified Phineas. The University College mascot soon disappeared again the following spring. King's was initially suspected but this time it was students of [[Caius College]], [[Cambridge]], who carried out the abduction.

The 1922 quad battle was viewed with alarm by the college authorities. The union reminded students that the quadrangle was a "dangerous and unsuitable place for ... rags" and the editor of the King's student journal went as far as to suggest a premeditated and deliberate aspect to the violence. It was, he said, "a good rag ... but got out of hand. It is a pity that the blinding of Mr Johnson…has not taught us that there is a limit."{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
 
The collapse of the balustrade was widely reported in the press with the ''Daily News'' describing a "Rag Beyond the Limit" and speculating that a release of liquid oxygen stored below the accident area might have led to a violent explosion. King's principal and University College's provost both agreed that although it was a tradition that any damages caused by a rag should be borne by the students responsible, that in this instance the repair bill of £237 should be collectively shared by students of both colleges.

===1927 – Students storm University College===
Two weeks of revelry characterised the 1927 rag. It began when UCL briefly captured Reggie and filled his body with rotten apples before returning him to King's. The response was swift: a contingent of female King's students drove to University College at dawn chanting, "For Reggie!" while their colleagues stole in via the rear entrance and captured a bust of [[Jeremy Bentham]]. The following day, King's students goaded their rivals by parading the bust outside University College.

Hostilities recommenced a week later centred on the UCL quad: the ammunition a variety of rotten eggs, fruit and vegetables. At least six students were injured and taken to nearby [[University College Hospital]] for treatment following the commencement of hostilities at 2&amp;nbsp;pm. King's were quickly reinforced by lorries carrying [[Covent Garden]] market refuse but many of their contingent, including Reggie, were trapped after police ordered the shutting of the UCL gates. Only a last minute scramble and the hauling of Reggie over the gates saved the King's commander-in-chief from the ignominy of capture and ransom.

As with the rag of 1922, the college authorities responded with a public tightening of discipline and a warning that "any further disturbances created by the students of the college with students of University College will be regarded as a breach of discipline and treated accordingly."{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===1929===
The sports' ground at [[Mitcham]] became the scene of a rag between UCL and King's in December when rival groups hurled rotten fruit and vegetables from lorries. The encounter followed a secret operation the previous night when King's students had infiltrated UCL's grounds and tarred and feathered one of the statues in front of the entrance.

==1938–1945: World War II==

The rivalry was suspended during [[World War II]] because of the evacuation of faculties to provincial cities and the change in mood which was summed up by a representative at the British Students' congress at Leeds who spoke of the need for students to contribute to the war effort and not be viewed as 'dilettante idiots'.

==1950 to present==

The truce survived until 1950, when hostilities between the colleges broke out afresh during the Bonfire celebrations on 5 November. King's students stormed the UCL quad, setting fire to two large pyres and throwing fireworks from the college steps.  While this was happening, two thousand UCL students circled [[Piccadilly Circus]] in painted lorries, to demand a lengthening of pub opening hours.  Thirteen arrests followed when flour was thrown and a fight broke out over a stuffed kangaroo.

The last traditional rags took place in the 1950s. In 1952, police broke up a series of races in the Strand between King's and UCL students dressed as camels and a cow. More daringly, in 1956, King's Engineers grabbed [[Phineas (disambiguation)|Phineas]] from a cabinet in the [[UCLU|University College Union]] after melting off its locks, the very day before the visit of the [[Queen Mother]] to inspect the Scottish Highlander. A tarred and feathered Phineas was restored with moments to spare.

Across the United Kingdom, student priorities began to change with the enlargement of the university sector in the 1960s. The growth of provincial higher education both enhanced the possibilities for the rag and the dangers of 'town and gown' tensions between permanent local, and transient student, populations. Universities across Britain tried to build bridges with local people, especially through fund raising initiatives for local charities. However, the 1960s, 70s and 80s all bore witness to a more politically aware student population with [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|demonstrations and sit-ins against Vietnam]], university cuts and the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]]. In this more highly charged climate, the traditional rag might have looked anachronistic and somewhat juvenile.

Nevertheless, there remained a place for conventional high spirits, in particular occasioned by King's renewed participation in the [[Lord Mayor's Show]].

Today, annual [[RAG (student society)|RAG]] events take place in universities throughout the United Kingdom to raise money for charities. The days of the sometimes dangerous outcomes of Student Rags, such as the fate of visiting American [[Temperance movement|temperance]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]], "Pussyfoot" Johnson who lost an eye in a battle with King's students in 1919, are over.

==Women==

The involvement of women in rags drew considerable comment during the 1920s. Under a headline "Women and those 'Rags'", a [[Star|The Star]] reporter claimed in 1929 that most women students were disdainful of the activities. Miss Paul, a tutor to women students at King's, insisted portentously that "displays of boisterousness were really exclusively men's affairs". However, women clearly played a central role in 1920s rags, including the raid on University College in 1927.&lt;ref name="Women and the Rags"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/iss/archives/rag/rag13.htm|title=Women and the Rags|accessdate=23 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other intercollegiate rivalries within the University of London==

Within the [[University of London]] student rivalry was not confined to King's and UCL, but spilled over into contests with [[Imperial College London|Imperial]], [[Queen Mary, University of London|Queen Mary]] colleges and the [[London School of Economics]].

One well-planned and successful rag against the LSE during the 1920s involved the King's Liberal Party Society organising an impostor to play the part of [[David Lloyd George]], complete with morning coat and limousine, who proceeded to address the [[LSE Students' Union]] in an appropriately overdramatic performance. A riot ensued when the angry audience realised they had been duped and the actor sent flying before rescue by a strategically placed King's rowing heavy.

Following the [[Second World War]], King's was involved in numerous kidnapping and ransoming of rival mascots, including Queen Mary's leopard and the LSE Penguin.

In 1935 a failed attempt was made by student of [[Queen Mary, University of London|Queen Mary]] to capture Reggie the Lion – "A further attempt to obtain a mascot [by QMUL] was made in 1935 and deserved a better result. One Wednesday afternoon, a well organized party assembled by devious routes in King's College and at zero hour took up their appointed posts. The porters were confined to their lodge and all entrances and exits were guarded. But Reggie the lion was chained in steel to the wall, and the porters had telephoned the police for aid! A hasty retreat was made with no casualties."

A triumph for Queen Mary students came in 1923 during a football cup final between [[Queen Mary, University of London|Queen Mary]] and University College. "The match was to be played on the Arsenal Football Club ground at Highbury, and the rag-committee had obtained an option on a fleet of Donkeys and carts on which it was proposed to drive down to the ground. Unknown to this committee a few research chemists thought of something better. They prepared a special paint, that would not easily wash off, and in the early hours of the morning, dodging the police on their beats they set to work on the imposing frontage of University College. Next morning, London was startled to find the place resplendent in the college colours, light blue and gold! An irate telephone call from Sir Gregory Foster to the Principal exposed the infamous deed. The cup-final match was promptly placed "out of bounds", but after many violent student demonstrations this ban was lifted just before lunch and the College supporters flocked down to Highbury under promise to abstain from ragging. University College won the match 5–4, and at the end called for three cheers for the "College of Decorators". The Union Society had to pay the bill of £50 for the removal of the paint. But we think it well worth it."&lt;ref name=godwin&gt;{{cite book |last=Godwin|first=George |pages=193–97 |year=1939 |title=Queen Mary College An Adventure in Education |publisher=Queen Mary College and The Acorn Press | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*************************************************************************************************--&gt;This is a list of [[musical composition]]s or [[Musical piece|piece]]s of music that have [[unusual time signatures]]. "Unusual" is here defined to be any time signature other than simple time signatures with top numerals of 2, 3, or 4 and bottom numerals of 2, 4, or 8, and compound time signatures with top numerals of 6, 9, or 12 and bottom numerals 4, 8, or 16.&lt;ref name="musictechmag"&gt;Ian Waugh first lists {{music|time|2|2}}, {{music|time|2|4}}, {{music|time|2|8}}, {{music|time|3|2}}, {{music|time|3|4}}, {{music|time|3|8}}, {{music|time|4|2}}, {{music|time|4|4}}, {{music|time|4|8}}, {{music|time|6|4}}, {{music|time|6|8}}, {{music|time|6|16}}, {{music|time|9|4}}, {{music|time|9|8}}, {{music|time|9|16}}, {{music|time|12|4}}, {{music|time|12|8}}, and {{music|time|12|16}} (Waugh 2003, 76), then says "we've listed all the popular time signatures" (Waugh 2003, 77).&lt;/ref&gt;

The conventions of musical notation typically allow for more than one written representation of a particular piece. The chosen time signature largely depends upon musical context, personal taste of the composer or transcriber, and the graphic layout on the written page. Frequently, published editions were written in a specific time signature to visually signify the tempo for slow movements in symphonies, sonatas, and concerti.

A perfectly consistent unusual metrical pattern may be notated in a more familiar time signature that does not correspond to it. For example, the Passacaglia from [[Benjamin Britten|Britten's]] opera ''[[Peter Grimes]]'' consists of variations over a recurring bass line eleven beats in length but is notated in ordinary {{music|time|4|4}} time, with each variation lasting {{frac|2|3|4}} bars, and therefore commencing each time one crotchet earlier in the bar than the preceding one had done.&lt;ref&gt;Britten 1945b.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lolo-Burmese''' languages (also '''Burmic''' languages) of [[Burma]] and [[Southern China]] form a coherent branch of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan family]].

==Names==
Until ca. 1950, the endonym ''Lolo'' was written with [[Graphic pejoratives in written Chinese|derogatory characters in Chinese]], and for this reason has sometimes been avoided. Shafer (1966–1974) used the term "Burmic" for the Lolo-Burmese languages. The Chinese term is ''Mian–Yi'', after the Chinese name for Burmese and one of several words for Tai, reassigned to replace ''Lolo'' by the Chinese government after 1950.&lt;ref name="Bradley Burmic"&gt;{{cite journal | given=David | surname=Bradley | title=The Characteristics of the Burmic Family of Tibeto-Burman | journal=Language and Linguistics | year=2012 | volume=13 | issue=1 | pages=171–192 | url=http://www.ling.sinica.edu.tw/files/publication/j2012_1_08_4916.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible languages==
The position of [[Naxish languages|Naxi]] (Moso) within the family is unclear, and it is often left as a third branch besides Loloish and Burmish. Lama (2012) considers it to be a branch of Loloish, while [[Guillaume Jacques]] has suggested that it is a [[Qiangic languages|Qiangic]] language.

The [[Pyu language (Burma)|Pyu language]] that preceded Burmese in Burma is sometimes linked to the Lolo-Burmese family, but there is no good evidence for any particular classification, and it is best left unclassified within Sino-Tibetan.

Löffler (1966) and Bradley (1997) consider the [[Mru language]] to be closely related to or part of Lolo-Burmese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Löffler | given=Lorenz G. | year=1966 | title=The contribution of Mru to Sino-Tibetan linguistics | journal=Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenländischen Gesellschaft | volume=116 | number=1 | pages=118–159 | jstor=43369896 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | given=David | surname=Bradley | chapter=Tibeto-Burman languages and classification | chapter-url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/bradley1997tibeto-burman.pdf | pages=1–71 | title=Tibeto-Burman languages of the Himalayas, Papers in South East Asian linguistics | location=Canberra | publisher=Pacific Linguistics | year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[James A.

[[Pai-lang language|Pai-lang]], attested from the 3rd century, is Lolo-Burmese, perhaps Loloish.

==External relationships==
[[Guillaume Jacques]] &amp; Alexis Michaud (2011)&lt;ref name="Jacques"&gt;{{cite journal | given1=Guillaume | surname1=Jacques | given2=Alexis | surname2=Michaud | title=Approaching the historical phonology of three highly eroded Sino-Tibetan languages | journal=Diachronica | year=2011 | volume=28 | pages=468–498 | doi=10.1075/dia.28.4.02jac.additional | doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; argue for a '''[[Burmo-Qiangic languages|Burmo-Qiangic]]''' branch with two primary subbranches, Na-[[Qiangic languages|Qiangic]] (i.e. Naxi-Qiangic) and Lolo-Burmese. Similarly, [[David Bradley (linguist)|David Bradley]] (2008)&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, David. 2008. ''The Position of Namuyi in Tibeto-Burman''.&lt;/ref&gt; also proposes an '''Eastern Tibeto-Burman''' branch that includes the two subbranches of Burmic ({{sc|aka}} Lolo-Burmese) and Qiangic.

==Internal classification==
Bradley (1997, quoted in Peiros 1997) gives the following classification for the Lolo-Burmese languages. In later publications, in place of ''Loloish'', David Bradley instead uses the term ''Ngwi'' based on a conservative [[Exonym and endonym|autonym]] in the [[Sanie language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | given=David | surname=Bradley | title=Sanie and language loss in China | journal=International Journal of the Sociology of Language | year=2005 | volume=2005 | issue=173 | pages=159–176 | doi=10.1515/ijsl.2005.2005.173.159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Lolo-Burmese'''
**[[Mru language|Mru]]
**Core Lolo-Burmese
***Ugong–Burmish
****[[Ugong language|Ugong]]
****[[Burmish languages|Burmish]]
***[[Loloish languages|Loloish]] (Ngwi)

Lama (2012), in a study of 36 languages, finds the [[Mondzish languages|Mondzish]] cluster ([[Mantsi language|Mondzi]]–[[Maang language|Maang]], Mantsi–Mo'ang) to be divergent. He did not include Mru or Ugong.

*'''Lolo-Burmese''' (Niso-Burmic)
**[[Mondzish languages|Mondzish]]
**Core Lolo-Burmese
***[[Burmish languages|Burmish]] (Burmic)
***[[Loloish languages|Loloish]] (Nisoic)

Lama (2012) recognizes 9 unambiguous coherent groups of Lolo-Burmese languages, whereas Bradley considers there to be 5 groups (Burmish, Southern Ngwi, Northern Ngwi, Southeastern Ngwi, and Central Ngwi).

#[[Mondzish languages|Mondzish]]

This local protest was part of the [[March for Science]], a series of rallies and marches in [[Washington, D.C.]] and over 600 cities across the world on April 22, 2017 ([[Earth Day]]). Portland Science Advocates organized the march in support of science and to protest President [[Donald Trump]]'s plan to cut funding for the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[National Institutes of Health]]. Funding for the event, which cost approximately $30,000, was [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]].

Amid rainy weather, thousands of people attended the demonstration, gathering at a rally at [[Tom McCall Waterfront Park]] before marching 44 blocks of [[downtown Portland]]. Speakers included [[Earl Blumenauer]], [[Suzanne Bonamici]], and [[Elizabeth Steiner Hayward]]. Organizations that promoted the protest included the [[Audubon Society of Portland]], [[Oregon Environmental Council]], [[Oregon Health &amp; Science University]], and [[Xerces Society]]. Reporters noted organizers' attempts to create a political yet nonpartisan atmosphere, and participants' public criticism of Trump. The event featured activities for children and was described as having a [[family-friendly]] atmosphere.

==Background==
===Organizers and motivation===
[[File:March for Science, PDX, 2017 - 29.jpg|thumb|right|Handmade sign with a variation on "[[Make America Great Again]]"]]

Portland's March for Science was organized by Portland Science Advocates.&lt;ref name=PSA/&gt;&lt;ref name=XS/&gt; The group was composed of people with backgrounds in various disciplines, including Jackie Wirz, an assistant dean at [[Oregon Health &amp; Science University]], and a store clerk with a passion for science and writing.&lt;ref name="Campuzano"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Campuzano|first1=Eder|title=Portland's March for Science: This one's for the kids|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2017/04/portland_science_march_earth_day_protest.html|accessdate=April 22, 2017|work=[[The Oregonian]]|date=April 22, 2017|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|issn=8750-1317|location=Portland, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event's steering committee included co-chairs Curt Waltman and Wirz; additionally, Rich Hatfield served as communications committee co-chair and Sumi Malik, a transportation planner for [[CH2M Hill]],&lt;ref name=Humanize/&gt; served as community outreach co-chair.&lt;ref name="Guest"&gt;{{cite news|title=Marching for science that's vital to Oregon's economy, environment and health (Guest opinion)|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2017/04/marching_for_science_thats_vit.html|accessdate=April 23, 2017|work=The Oregonian|date=April 21, 2017|first1=Curt|last1=Waltman|first2=Jackie|last2=Wirz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Conley was also an organizer.&lt;ref name=Humanize/&gt; The organizers met through the event's Facebook page, which was launched in February 2017, and sought advice from the organizers of the [[Women's March on Portland]], which was held in January 2017.&lt;ref name="Humanize"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Campuzano|first1=Eder|title=Portland's March for Science: 'We want to humanize scientists'|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2017/04/portland_march_for_science.html|accessdate=April 25, 2017|work=The Oregonian|date=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizers wanted to support science and protest [[Donald Trump]]'s plan to cut funding for the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[National Institutes of Health]]. The event was also to protest Trump's threat to withdraw from the [[Paris Agreement]] and decrease funding for scientific research and [[K–12]] science programs,&lt;ref name=Humanize/&gt;&lt;ref name="KUOW"&gt;{{cite web|title=Looming Budget Cuts Put Scientists In Limbo|url=http://kuow.org/post/looming-budget-cuts-put-scientists-limbo|publisher=[[KUOW-FM]]|accessdate=April 23, 2017|date=April 21, 2017|location=Seattle}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other policies.&lt;ref name="Oregonian"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2017/04/traffic_delays_portland_march_for_science_earth_day.html|accessdate=April 22, 2017|work=The Oregonian|date=April 21, 2017|first=Eder|last=Campuzano|title=Prepare for traffic, delays downtown during Portland's March for Science on Saturday}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the march, Waltman and Wirz wrote a guest column in ''[[The Oregonian]]'', where they noted Oregon's achievements in science, and encouraged people to "stand up for science".&lt;ref name=Guest/&gt; They said, "We stand in support of scientific inquiry, researchers, availability of data and evidence-based policy", and invited people who "love" science to participate.&lt;ref name=Guest/&gt;

===Preparation and planning===

Funding for the event, which cost approximately $30,000, was crowdsourced. Obtaining a permit to host the event at the park cost $3,000.&lt;ref name=Humanize/&gt; Monetary donations were accepted, and merchandise sales also funded the demonstrations. Funds were transferred through the [[Xerces Society]].&lt;ref name=Humanize/&gt; Portland Science Advocates was established as a nonprofit organization for members to continue the demonstration's mission after the march.&lt;ref name=Humanize/&gt;

Prior to the march, organizers surveyed [[Tom McCall Waterfront Park]] and posted flyers about the event in the surrounding area.&lt;ref name=Humanize/&gt; They emphasized that all people were invited to participate, not just scientists,&lt;ref name="Guide"&gt;{{cite news|title=Guide to Portland's March for Science Saturday, expected to be thousands strong |url=http://katu.com/news/local/guide-portland-march-for-science-downtown-speaker-size-number-signs |accessdate=April 22, 2017 |publisher=[[KATU]] |date=April 21, 2017 |location=Portland, Oregon |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621060237/http://katu.com/news/local/guide-portland-march-for-science-downtown-speaker-size-number-signs |archivedate=June 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and anticipated participation by approximately 10,000 demonstrators.&lt;ref name="Vespa"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vespa|first1=Maggie|title=Thousands March for Science in Portland|url=http://www.kgw.com/news/politics/thousands-march-for-science-in-portland/433419583|accessdate=April 23, 2017|publisher=[[KGW]]|date=April 22, 2017|location=Portland, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Humanize/&gt; Nearly 7,000 had committed to attending the event on its [[Facebook]] page.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas |first1=Keaton |title=Thousands take to the streets of downtown Portland for Earth Day 'March for Science' |url=http://katu.com/news/local/thousands-expected-in-downtown-portland-for-earth-day-march-for-science |accessdate=April 22, 2017 |publisher=KATU |date=April 22, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426085522/http://katu.com/news/local/thousands-expected-in-downtown-portland-for-earth-day-march-for-science |archivedate=April 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizers planned to use drones to help estimate the crowd size.&lt;ref name=Humanize/&gt;

The Audubon Society of Portland organized a sign making party on April 20.&lt;ref name=ASP/&gt;

==Commentary and documentation==
Leading up to the event, ''[[The Portland Mercury]]''{{'s}} Erik Henriksen encouraged readers to join the march, writing: "Trump's hostility to science isn't just an attack on humankind's accumulated knowledge—it's an attack on all of us, and its repercussions will affect everyone on Earth, every day, for the rest of our lives. Time to fight back."&lt;ref name=Henriksen/&gt; [[KOIN]] said organizers portrayed the demonstration as "political but not partisan, promoting the understanding of science as well as defending it from various attacks, including proposed U.S. government budget cuts under President Donald Trump".&lt;ref name=KOIN/&gt; Similarly, Maggie Vespa of [[KGW]] said, "Although organizers trumpeted the event's 'nonpartisan' platform, participants in Portland were quick to take aim at President Trump's proposed funding cuts to scientific research agencies."&lt;ref name=Vespa/&gt;

[[File:March For Science PDX (34209711036).jpg|thumb|left|Demonstrators]]

Following the event, ''The Oregonian''{{'s}} Eder Campuzano noted, "unlike so many similar demonstrations — such as January's Women's March, the [[Tax March|Tax Day March]] or several other downtown protests — this one skewed younger".&lt;ref name=Campuzano/&gt; Furthermore, he said of the event's [[family-friendly]] atmosphere: "Demonstrators turned out in droves with their children in tow, a fact many parents attributed to the fact that event organizers had provided a kids' zone near the Battleship Oregon Memorial with educational booths and live music nearby."&lt;ref name=Campuzano/&gt; Lyndsey Hewitt of the ''[[Portland Tribune]]'' noted, "The March for Science's crowd was somewhat calmer than the Women's March, which was an audience electrified, fresh off the heels of President Donald Trump's inauguration... The March for Science, however — announced not long after the Women's March — had a much more focused group of protestors."&lt;ref name=Hewitt/&gt;

One demonstrator, immuno-oncologist and filmmaker Tyler Hulett, documented the march and created the 8-mintute film, ''A Scientist Documents the March for Science''. The film features people "whose lives and careers intersect with science and research", including a woman who believes funding for her cancer research work is being threatened, a couple who is worried about reduced Great Lakes Restoration Initiative funding, and a woman concerned about Portland's unfluoridated water.&lt;ref name="MacMurdo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacMurdo |first1=Walker |title=Watch a Short Documentary About the Portland March for Science Made by Local Scientist |url=http://www.wweek.com/arts/movies/2017/04/25/watch-a-short-documentary-about-the-portland-march-for-science-made-by-a-portland-scientist/ |accessdate=April 25, 2017 |work=Willamette Week |date=April 25, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426154552/http://www.wweek.com/arts/movies/2017/04/25/watch-a-short-documentary-about-the-portland-march-for-science-made-by-a-portland-scientist/ |archivedate=April 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hulett wanted to raise awareness about the people involved in scientific research, and said his goal was to "show that many of Portland's doctors and scientists are concerned about the lack of critical thinking coming from both sides of the political aisle".&lt;ref name=MacMurdo/&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Mayaguez'' incident}}
The '''''Mayaguez'' incident''' took place between [[Democratic Kampuchea|Kampuchea]] and the [[United States]] from May 12–15, 1975, less than a month after the [[Khmer Rouge]] took [[Cambodian Civil War#Fall of Phnom Penh|control of the capital Phnom Penh]] ousting the U.S. backed [[Khmer Republic]].  It was the last official battle of the [[Vietnam War]]. The names of the Americans killed, as well as those of three [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] who were left behind on the island of [[Koh Tang]] after the battle and were subsequently executed by the Khmer Rouge, are the last names on the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]]. The merchant ship's crew, whose seizure at sea had prompted the U.S. attack, had been released in good health, unknown to the U.S. Marines or the U.S. command of the operation before they attacked. Nevertheless, the Marines boarded and recaptured the ship anchored offshore a Cambodian island, finding it empty.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn&gt;{{cite book|last=Wetterhahn|first=Ralph|title=The Last Battle: The Mayaguez Incident and the end of the Vietnam War|publisher=Plume|year=2002|isbn=0-452-28333-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Khmer Rouge seize the ''Mayaguez''==

[[File:Marines board the Mayaguez.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines from [[1st Battalion 4th Marines]] boarding the ship on 15 May]]
The crisis began on the afternoon of May 12, 1975, as the U.S. [[container ship]] {{SS|Mayaguez}}, owned by [[Sea-Land Service|Sea-Land Service Inc.]], passed nearby [[Poulo Wai]] island en route to [[Sattahip]], Thailand, in waters claimed as 12 nautical miles of [[territorial waters]] by Cambodia. The U.S. did not recognize 12 nautical miles territorial waters claims at that time, recognizing only 3 nautical miles, and characterised the location as international sea lanes on the high seas.&lt;ref name=mlr82-behuniak/&gt;{{rp|104,121–125}} U.S. military reports state that the seizure took place 6 nautical miles off the island,&lt;ref name=mlr82-behuniak/&gt;{{rp|124}} but crew members brought evidence in a later legal action that ''Mayaguez'' had sailed about two nautical miles off Poulo Wai and was not flying a flag.&lt;ref name=paust-1981/&gt;

At 14:18, a Khmer Rouge naval forces "[[Fast Patrol Craft|Swift Boat]]" was sighted approaching the ''Mayaguez''.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|26}} The Khmer Rouge fired across the bow of ''Mayaguez'' and when Captain Charles T. Miller ordered the engine room to slow down to maneuvering speed to avoid the machine-gun fire, the Khmer Rouge then fired a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] across the bow of the ship. Captain Miller ordered the transmission of an [[SOS]] and then stopped the ship.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|27}}  Seven Khmer Rouge soldiers boarded ''Mayaguez'' and their leader, Battalion Commander Sa Mean, pointed at a map indicating that the ship should proceed to the east of Poulo Wai.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|29}} One of the crew members broadcast a [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]] which was picked up by an Australian vessel.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|30–31}}  ''Mayaguez'' arrived off Poulo Wai at approximately 16:00 and a further 20 Khmer Rouge boarded the vessel. Sa Mean indicated that ''Mayaguez'' should proceed to [[Ream Naval Base|Ream]] on the Cambodian mainland, but Captain Miller showed that the ship's radar was not working and mimed the ship hitting rocks and sinking. Sa Mean radioed his superiors and was apparently instructed to stay at Poulo Wai, dropping anchor at 16:55.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|31–32}}

''Mayaguez'' was carrying 107 containers of routine cargo, 77 containers of government and military cargo, and 90 empty containers, all insured for $5 million.&lt;ref name=mlr82-behuniak/&gt;{{rp|47}} The Khmer Rouge never inspected the containers, and exact contents have not been disclosed, but ''Mayaguez'' had loaded containers from the [[Embassy of the United States, Saigon|U.S. Embassy in Saigon]] nine days before the fall of Saigon. The captain had a U.S. government envelope only to be opened in special circumstances, which he destroyed.&lt;ref name=paust-1981/&gt;

==President Ford reacts==
''Mayaguez''{{'}}s SOS and Mayday signals were picked up by a number of listeners including an employee of Delta Exploration Company in [[Jakarta]], Indonesia, who notified the [[Embassy of the United States, Jakarta|U.S. Embassy in Jakarta]].&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|33}} By 05:12 [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Daylight Time]] (EDT) the first news of the incident reached the [[National Military Command Center]] (NMCC) in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|34}}

President [[Gerald Ford]] was informed of the seizure of ''Mayaguez'' at his morning briefing with his [[Deputy National Security Advisor (United States)|deputy assistant for national security affairs]], [[Brent Scowcroft]].&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|34}} At 12:05 EDT (21:05 Cambodia), a meeting of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC) was convened to discuss the situation. Meanwhile, the NMCC ordered Admiral [[Noel Gayler]], who was the Commander in Chief of the [[United States Pacific Command|U.S. Pacific Command]] (CINCPAC) at the time, to launch reconnaissance aircraft to locate ''Mayaguez''.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|35}} The members of the NSC were determined to end the crisis decisively, believing that the fall of South Vietnam less than two weeks before and the forced withdrawal of the United States from Cambodia ([[Operation Eagle Pull|Operation ''Eagle Pull'']]) and South Vietnam ([[Operation Frequent Wind|Operation ''Frequent Wind'']]) had severely damaged the U.S.'s reputation. They also wished to avoid comparisons to the [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|''Pueblo'' incident]] of 1968, where the failure to promptly use military force to halt the capture of a U.S. intelligence ship by [[North Korea]] led to an eleven-month hostage situation. It was determined that keeping ''Mayaguez'' and her crew away from the Cambodian mainland was essential.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|36–39}} As the United States had no diplomatic contact with the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, President Ford instructed Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] to urge the People's Republic of China to persuade the Khmer Rouge to release ''Mayaguez'' and her crew.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|39}}
[[File:Container ship SS Mayaguez, 1975.jpg|thumb|right|The container ship {{SS|Mayaguez}}]]

Following the NSC meeting the White House issued a press release stating that President Ford considered the seizure an act of [[piracy]], though this claim did not have foundation in maritime law.&lt;ref name=mlr82-behuniak&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/DOCLIBS/MILITARYLAWREVIEW.NSF/20a66345129fe3d885256e5b00571830/b3197adca4437e4d85256e5b0057ee6a/$FILE/MLR%2027-100-82%2019781001.pdf |title=The Seizure and Recovery of the S.S.

Schlesinger]] ordered the military to locate ''Mayaguez'' and prevent her movement to the Cambodian mainland, employing munitions (including [[tear gas]] and sea mines) if necessary.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|40}}

Secretary of State Kissinger sent a message to the Chinese Liaison Office in Washington demanding the immediate release of ''Mayaguez'' and her crew, but the chief of the Liaison Office refused to accept the note. Kissinger then instructed [[George H. W. Bush]], then head of the U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing, to deliver the note to the Chinese Foreign Ministry and to pass on an oral message that "The Government of the United States demands the immediate release of the vessel and of the full crew. If that release does not immediately take place, the authorities in Phnom Penh will be responsible for the consequences."&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|40}}

==U.S. rescue preparations==
Following Secretary Schlesinger's instructions, [[P-3 Orion]] aircraft stationed at [[Naval Air Station Cubi Point]] in the Philippines and at [[U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield]] in Thailand took off to locate ''Mayaguez''.  The [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43|6}}, then en route to Australia, was ordered into the area.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|43}} The destroyer escort {{USS|Harold E. Holt|FF-1074|6}} and the guided missile destroyer {{USS|Henry B. Wilson|DDG-7|6}} were both ordered to proceed at high speed from the [[Philippine Sea]] towards ''Mayaguez''{{'}}s last known location.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|44–45}}

An alert order was sent to [[1st Battalion 4th Marines]] (1/4 Marines) at [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]] and to the [[9th Marine Regiment (United States)|9th Marine Regiment]] on [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]]. A reinforced company from 1/4 Marines was ordered to assemble at [[Naval Air Station Cubi Point]] for airlift to Thailand, while an 1100-man Battalion Landing Team (BLT) assembled in Okinawa.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|45}}

===Locating and stopping ''Mayaguez''===
On the early morning of May 13, the P-3 Orions identified large [[Radar#Reflection|radar returns]] near Poulo Wai and dropped flares on the suspected location of ''Mayaguez'' provoking Khmer Rouge gunfire. Low on fuel, the two Orions returned to base and were replaced with another Orion from [[VP-17|Patrol Squadron 17]]. At 08:16 local time the Orion made a low pass over Poulo Wai positively identifying ''Mayaguez'' and again drawing Khmer Rouge gunfire.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|50–51}}

Shortly after the Orion made its low pass, the Khmer Rouge leader, Sa Mean, ordered Captain Miller to get ''Mayaguez'' under way. At 08:45 ''Mayaguez'' set off towards the northeast following one of the [[Patrol Craft Fast|Swift Boats]].&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|53}} The Orion continued to track ''Mayaguez'' as she left Poulo Wai. Once the location of ''Mayaguez'' was identified, Admiral Gayler ordered the commander of the [[Seventh Air Force]], Lieutenant General John J. Burns, at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, to move combat aircraft to the area.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|54}} At 13:00 two unarmed [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|F-111 fighter-bombers]] diverted from a training mission began making low-level high-speed passes by ''Mayaguez''. Once the F-111s had left, Sa Mean ordered Captain Miller to follow the swift boats around [[Koh Tang]] and drop anchor approximately 1.5&amp;nbsp;km north of the island.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|54–55}} Two [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantoms]] soon arrived over ''Mayaguez'' and began firing their [[M61 Vulcan|20&amp;nbsp;mm cannon]] into the water in front of the ship. The F-4s were followed by [[LTV A-7 Corsair II|A-7Ds]] and more F-111s which continued to fire into the sea in front of and behind the ship indicating that no further movement should be attempted.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|55–56}}

At 16:15, the Khmer Rouge ordered ''Mayaguez''{{'}}s crew onto two fishing boats which then took them closer to the shore of Koh Tang.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|56–58}}

===Fishing boats interdicted===
U.S. Navy ships ''Coral Sea'', ''Holt'' and ''Wilson'' were all scheduled to arrive on station by 15 May, but none of these ships carried any troops.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|61}} {{USS|Hancock|CV-19|6}} carried a Marine contingent but could not arrive on station until 16 May, while {{USS|Okinawa|LPH-3|6}} also carried Marines but could not arrive until 18 May.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|61–62}}

[[III Marine Expeditionary Force|III Marine Amphibious Force]] (III MAF) assigned Task Force 79.9 with recovering ''Mayaguez'' and designated D Company 1/4 Marines in the Philippines as the unit that would actually retake ''Mayaguez'', but General Burns wanted additional force and orders were sent to the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3d Marine Division]] on Okinawa. [[1st Battalion 9th Marines|1st Battalion, 9th Marines]] (BLT 1/9) was then on alert as the primary "air contingency" reaction force, but most of BLT 1/9 were ending their tours of duty and were not subject to further extension of their tours except in the case of emergency. III MAF requested the extension of BLT 1/9's tour but this was refused.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|62}} [[2nd Battalion 9th Marines|2nd Battalion, 9th Marines]] (BLT 2/9) (commanded by Lieutenant Colonel [[Randall W. Austin]]) was then in a training exercise on Okinawa and it received orders on the night of 13 May to return to camp and prepare for departure by air at dawn on 14 May.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|63–65}} On the morning of 14 May BLT 2/9 boarded Air Force [[Lockheed C-141 Starlifter|C-141s]] at [[Kadena Air Base]] to fly to Thailand.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|66}} The [[9th Marine Regiment (United States)|9th Marine Regiment]] had been the first U.S. ground combat force committed to the [[Vietnam War]] in 1965, but in May 1975 only a few of the officers and NCOs from BLT 2/9 had seen combat in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|65–66}}

Nine [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[MH-53 Pave Low|HH-53]] ''Jolly Green'' helicopters of the [[40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron]] and 10 [[CH-53]] ''Knives'' of the [[21st Special Operations Squadron]] were stationed at Nakhon Phanom in Thailand for the rescue operation.&lt;ref name=Dunham&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunham|first=George R|title=U.S. Marines in Vietnam: The Bitter End, 1973-1975 (Marine Corps Vietnam Operational Historical Series)|publisher=Marine Corps Association|year=1990|url=https://archive.org/details/TheBitterEnd|isbn=9780160264559}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|239}} There were differences between the two types which would become relevant during the battle:  the HH-53 was air-refuelable, had 450-gallon foam-filled (i.e., self-sealing) tip tanks, a tail [[minigun]] with armor plating, and two waist miniguns. The CH-53 was not air-refuelable, but had 650-gallon foamless tip tanks and two miniguns, although no tail gun. Thus, the HH-53's fuel tanks were less vulnerable to ground fire and with its refueling capability, could remain in the battle area indefinitely as long as it had access to an aerial tanker.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|245}}

On May 13, General Burns and his Seventh Air Force staff developed a contingency plan to retake ''Mayaguez'' using an assault force composed of men of the Air Force [[56th Security Police Squadron]]. 75 volunteers from the 56th would be dropped onto the containers on the decks of ''Mayaguez'' on the morning of 14 May. In preparation for this assault five HH-53s and seven CH-53s were ordered to proceed to [[U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield]] for staging.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|76–77}} At approximately 21:30, one of the 21st SOS CH-53s (68-10933, call sign ''Knife 13'') crashed en route to U Tapao, killing 18 security police and its five-man crew.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|240}}

[[File:US Airmen aboard CH-53, during Mayagüez incident 1975.jpg|thumb|right|These 23 U.S. airmen were killed when their helicopter crashed due to a mechanical failure]]
President Ford chaired an NSC meeting at 10:22 EDT (21:22 Cambodia), where the Air Force rescue plan was cancelled due to the loss of ''Knife 13'' and the fact that the containers on ''Mayaguez'' could not bear the weight of the helicopters while [[Abseiling|rappelling]] men down would expose them to gunfire.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|79}} It was decided that it was necessary to wait for the Navy ships to arrive off Koh Tang and for the Marines to assemble in Thailand before a rescue attempt would be mounted. President Ford ordered the Air Force to stop any Cambodian boats moving between Koh Tang and the mainland.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|80}}

Early on the morning of May 14, the Khmer Rouge loaded ''Mayaguez''{{'}}s crew onto one of the fishing boats and they left Koh Tang following two of the swift boats on a heading for [[Kampong Som]].&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|91}} Two F-111s swept past the fishing boat, followed by a pair of F-4s and a pair of A-7s, which began firing in front of the swift boats and then directly at the swift boats, causing one of them to turn back to Koh Tang. The jets were then joined by an [[AC-130H Spectre]] gunship from the [[388th Tactical Fighter Wing]] which proceeded to engage the second swift boat with its cannons.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|92}} An A-7D then sprayed the Swift boat with its 20&amp;nbsp;mm cannon, sinking it.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|96}} The fighters then came at the fishing boat dropping bombs and firing their cannon into the water in front of it, spraying the boat with shrapnel.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|92}} The fighter crews reported back that 30 to 40 Caucasians had been seen on board the fishing boat.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|97}}

In Washington, President Ford convened another NSC meeting at 22:30 EDT (09:30 14 May Cambodia).&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|97}} A communication link had been established between the White House, Seventh Air Force at Nakhon Phanom, CINCPAC in Hawaii, and the aircraft orbiting above Koh Tang allowing for near real-time communications.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|95–96}} The orbiting fighters reported that they could try to shoot the rudder off the fishing boat to stop its progress to Kampong Som, but the NSC decided that the risk of killing ''Mayaguez'' crew was too great. At 23:00 EDT (10:00 Cambodia) President Ford ordered that only riot-control agents should be dropped on or near the fishing boat, while all patrol boats should be sunk.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|97–99}}

The NSC meeting continued to consider the appropriate course to resolve the crisis. It was informed that the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing had refused to pass on the American note intended for the Khmer Rouge, but George Bush reported that they had read the note and that it might have been relayed to the Khmer Rouge.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|99}} With a diplomatic solution appearing unlikely, General [[David Charles Jones|David Jones]], acting [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], presented the NSC with a range of military options. Rescue planning was complicated by the uncertainty surrounding the location of ''Mayaguez''{{'}}s crew. It was believed that some were still on the ship, some on Koh Tang and others were on the fishing boat bound for Kampong Som. The NSC decided to proceed with a simultaneous attack by Marines to retake ''Mayaguez'' and attack Koh Tang, together with attacking Cambodian shipping and bombing mainland targets.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|100}}

At 10:10, despite having been hit by tear gas, the fishing boat arrived at Kampong Som. The Khmer Rouge commander at Kampong Som, apparently fearing attack by the Americans, refused to accept responsibility for ''Mayaguez''{{'}}s crew and so the fishing boat moved further down the coast, dropping anchor off the island of [[Koh Rong Sanloem]]. The orbiting fighters lost track of the fishing boat once it entered the port at Kampong Som, and so this was the location transmitted up the chain of command.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|104–109}} At 11:29, U.S. aircraft sank another patrol boat and damaged another four.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|337}}

1/4 Marines had arrived at U-Tapao from the Philippines at 05:45 on May 14 and had been waiting on standby for a helicopter assault on ''Mayaguez'', but as the news of the arrival of the fishing boat at Kampong Som came in the helicopter assault was cancelled.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|111–112}} At 14:00, BLT 2/9 began arriving at U-Tapao.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|112}}

===The rescue plan===
[[File:Koh Tang aerial view.jpg|thumb|right|USAF reconnaissance photo of Koh Tang, showing East Beach and two downed CH-53s (left) and West Beach (right)]]
On the afternoon of 14 May, General Burns received the order to proceed with a simultaneous assault on Koh Tang and ''Mayaguez'' timed to begin just before sunrise (05:42) on 15 May.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|112}} D Company 1/4 Marines would retake ''Mayaguez'' while BLT 2/9 Marines would rescue the crew on Koh Tang.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|113}} With minimal intelligence available regarding the geography of Koh Tang, the commander of BLT 2/9 and his staff took off in a [[Beechcraft King Air#Military King Air versions|U-21]] to make an aerial reconnaissance of the island. Arriving over Koh Tang at 16:00, they were prevented from closely approaching the island in order not to compromise the secrecy of the mission or draw ground fire, but they determined that the island was so covered in jungle that the only two viable landing zones available were beaches on the west and east shores of the northern portion of Koh Tang.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|114}} The [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] had made an assessment, in part from [[RF-4C]] and [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] reconnaissance flights, that between 150 and 200 Khmer Rouge backed by heavy weapons occupied Koh Tang. This report was conveyed to U-Tapao air base, but was never briefed to the planners, who believed about 20 Cambodian irregulars armed with small-arms were on the island, probably due to security classification issues.&lt;ref name=dia-2012&gt;{{cite report |pages=37–39, 49 |url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB534-DIA-Declassified-Sourcebook/documents/DIA-46.pdf |title=The Vietnam Cauldron: Defense Intelligence in the War for Southeast Asia |author=Michael B. Petersen |publisher=Defense Intelligence Agency |work=Defense Intelligence Historical Perspectives, Number 2 |year=2012 |accessdate=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 21:00, the rescue plan was finalized. Six hundred Marines from BLT 2/9 — composed of Golf and Echo Companies — were assigned to conduct a combat assault in five CH-53 ''Knives'' and three HH-53 ''Jolly Greens'' to seize and hold Koh Tang.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|245}} Two helicopters would make a diversionary assault on the West Beach, while six helicopters would make the main assault on the wider East Beach. The East Beach force would move to the nearby compound where ''Mayaguez''{{'}}s crew was believed to be held and then move across and link up with the West Beach force. Two more waves of helicopters would be required to deploy all of BLT 2/9 to Koh Tang. The flight from U-Tapao to Koh Tang was a four-hour round trip. It was estimated that only 20-30 Khmer Rouge were on Koh Tang; the information regarding the heavy anti-aircraft fire coming from Koh Tang and the number of gunboats present was not passed on to the Marines.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|120–121}}  A unit of 57 Marines from Delta Company, 1/4 Marines together with volunteers from [[Military Sealift Command]] to get ''Mayaguez'' under way, an explosive ordnance disposal team and a Cambodian linguist would be transferred by three HH-53 ''Jolly Greens'' to the ''Holt'' which was scheduled to arrive on station at dawn for a ship-to-ship boarding of ''Mayaguez'' one hour after the assault on Koh Tang began.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|122}} Two additional CH-53s (because of their superior firepower, all the HH-53s were used for troop lift) were tasked as [[Combat Search and Rescue]] helicopters, supported by an [[HC-130]]P "King" command-and-control aircraft of the [[56th Rescue Squadron]].

USS ''Wilson'' was assigned to support the Koh Tang operation, and, after retaking ''Mayaguez'', USS ''Holt'' would be deployed in a blocking position between Koh Tang and the Cambodian mainland with the mission of intercepting and engaging any Khmer reaction forces. U.S. Navy aircraft from ''Coral Sea'' were given the mission of striking targets on the Cambodian mainland to prevent interference with the rescue.

At 15:52 EDT (02:52 15 May Cambodia), President Ford convened the fourth and final NSC meeting regarding ''Mayaguez''. General Jones briefed the NSC on the assault plan and plans for strikes by [[Andersen Air Force Base|Guam]]-based [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52s]] on the port facilities at Kampong Som and the naval base at [[Ream Naval Base|Ream]]. Concerned that the use of B-52s might be excessive, President Ford limited the bombing to attacks by carrier-based aircraft commencing at 07:45 (Cambodia) and gave the go-ahead to the rescue plan.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|123–124}}

==The Khmer Rouge on Koh Tang==
Unknown to the Americans then converging on Koh Tang, none of ''Mayaguez''{{'}}s crew were on the island, which was defended by over 100 Khmer Rouge. These defenses were intended to counter the Vietnamese, not the Americans. Following the [[Fall of Saigon]], the [[Vietnam People's Army]] moved quickly to take control of a number of islands formerly controlled by [[South Vietnam]] and other islands contested between Vietnam and Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge commander of Kampong Som District, Em Son, was also given responsibility for securing Koh Tang and on 1 May he took a force of 100 men to Koh Tang to defend the island against attack by the Vietnamese. Sa Mean was given responsibility for the defense of Poulo Wai.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|141}}

On the East Beach two heavy machine guns had been dug in at each end of the beach and fortified firing positions had been built every 20 metres behind a sand berm connected by a shallow zig-zag trench. Two [[M60 machine gun]]s, [[RPG-2|B-40 rocket-propelled grenades]] and two [[DK-82]] mortar/grenade launchers were in the firing positions. On the West Beach a heavy machine gun, an M60, B-40 rocket-propelled grenades and a 75&amp;nbsp;mm recoilless rifle were dug into connected firing positions. North of each beach was a 60&amp;nbsp;mm mortar and south of the beaches was an 81&amp;nbsp;mm mortar that could fire on either beach. Ammunition was stored in dug-in bunkers, one behind each beach, with a third ammunition dump located near Em Son's command post in the jungle south of the beaches.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|132–133}}

==''Mayaguez''{{'}}s crew on Rong Sang Lem==
On their arrival at Rong Sang Lem Captain Miller was taken to the senior Khmer Rouge commander where he was subject to a cursory interrogation before being asked if he could talk to the American planes from ''Mayaguez''. The Khmer Rouge explained that they had already lost three boats and numerous men and were anxious to call off the American bombers. Captain Miller explained that if they returned to the ship and restarted her engines they could then generate electricity to call their office in Bangkok which could then contact the U.S. military. The Khmer Rouge radioed instructions to their higher command and then gave approval for Captain Miller and nine men to return to ''Mayaguez''. As darkness was falling it was decided that they would return to ''Mayaguez'' the following morning, 15 May.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|114–118}}

==Rescue operation==
===Retaking ''Mayaguez''===

At 06:13 on May 15, the first phase of the operation began with the transfer by three HH-53s of D/1/4 Marines to the ''Holt''. As the ''Holt'' slowly came alongside, USAF [[A-7 Corsair II|A-7D]] aircraft saturated ''Mayaguez'' with [[tear gas]] munitions. Equipped with gas masks, the Marines at 07:25 hours then conducted one of the few hostile ship-to-ship [[Boarding (attack)|boardings]] by the U.S. Navy since the [[American Civil War]], securing the vessel after an hour-long search, finding her empty.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|185–188}}

At 06:12, the eight helicopters (five CH-53 ''Knives'' and three HH-53 ''Jolly Greens'') of the Koh Tang assault force approached the two [[Landing zone]]s (LZs) on Koh Tang. At the West Beach, the first section of two CH-53 helicopters came in at 06:20 hours. The first helicopter; ''Knife 21'', landed safely, but while offloading its Marines came under heavy automatic weapons fire, destroying an engine. It managed to take off, protected by suppressive fire from the second CH-53, ''Knife 22'', and ditched 1.6&amp;nbsp;km offshore. ''Knife 22'' was damaged so severely that it turned back with its Marines (including the Golf Company commander) still aboard escorted by ''Jolly Green 11'' and ''Jolly Green 12'', and crash-landed in [[Trat Province]] on the Thai coast, where its passengers were picked up by ''Jolly Green 12'' and returned to U-Tapao.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|159–162, 209–210}}&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|248}}

At 06:30, the CH-53s approaching the East Beach encountered intense automatic weapons and [[rocket propelled grenade|RPG]] fire from entrenched Khmer Rouge. ''Knife 31'' was hit by two RPGs, which ignited its left fuel tank and ripped away the nose of the helicopter. It crashed in a fireball fifty meters offshore. A pilot, five Marines, and two Navy [[corpsmen]] were killed in the crash, another Marine drowned swimming from the wreck, and three Marines were killed by gunfire trying to reach the beach. A tenth Marine died of his wounds while clinging to the burning wreckage. The surviving ten Marines and three Air Force crewmen were forced to swim for two hours before being picked up by the [[Captain's Gig|gig]] of the arriving ''Henry B. Wilson''.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|195–197}} Among the Marine survivors was the battalion's [[Forward Air Controller]], who used an Air Force [[survival radio]] while swimming to direct [[A-7 Corsair II|A-7]] air strikes against the island until the battery failed. The second CH-53, ''Knife 23'' was hit by an RPG which blew off the tail section and crash-landed on the East Beach, but it successfully offloaded its 20 Marines and crew of five. They set up a defensive perimeter and the ''Knife 23'' copilot used his survival radio to call in airstrikes, but they would remain cut off from both reinforcements and rescue for twelve hours.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|162–167}}&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|248–249}}

''Knife 32'' was inbound to the East Beach when it was hit by an RPG and aborted its landing, instead heading out over the West Beach to the ''Knife 21'' crash site where it dumped fuel and proceeded to rescue the three ''Knife 21'' crewmen.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|170–171}} Two other sections of the first wave, consisting of the remaining four helicopters, were diverted from the East Beach to the West Beach and eventually landed all of their Marines between 06:30 and 07:00 hours, although the final insertion by ''Jolly Green 41'' required support from an [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 Spectre gunship]] in order to penetrate the Khmer Rouge fire on its fifth attempt. ''Knife 32'', ''Jolly Green 41'' and ''Jolly Green 42'' eventually landed 81 Marines on the West Beach under the command of the company Executive Officer, and ''Jolly Green 43'' landed 29 Marines of the battalion command post and mortar platoon a kilometer to the southwest.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|250}} By 07:00 109 Marines and five Air Force crewmen were on Koh Tang, but in three isolated beach areas and in close contact with Khmer Rouge troops. The Marines at the northern end of West Beach attempted to move down the beach to link up with Col Austin's command element to the south, but were beaten back by heavy Khmer Rouge fire which killed LCpl Ashton Loney.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|176–178}} While isolated, the Marines were able to use their [[Mortar (weapon)|81&amp;nbsp;mm mortars]] for fire support and devised a makeshift communications network for controlling supporting air strikes by USAF A-7 and [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4]] aircraft. It was decided that the platoon isolated on the East Beach should be extracted; following suppressive fire from an AC-130, ''Jolly Green 13'' landed there at 08:15 amid a hail of machine gun fire. It had landed some 100&amp;nbsp;m away from the Marines who were reluctant to risk running to the helicopter, the helicopter took off again with its fuel lines ruptured and made an emergency landing in [[Rayong]], Thailand.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|175–176}}&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|249–251}}

Of the eight helicopters assaulting Koh Tang, three had been destroyed (''Knife 21'', ''Knife 23'' and ''Knife 31'') and four others damaged too severely to continue operations (''Knife 22'', ''Knife 32'', ''Jolly Green 41'' and ''Jolly Green 42''). Of the helicopters used in the recapture of ''Mayaguez'', ''Jolly Green 13'' had been severely damaged in the East Beach rescue attempt.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|249–251}} This left only three helicopters (all HH-53s - ''Jolly Greens 11, 12 and 43'') of the original eleven available to bring in the follow-up forces of BLT 2/9, so the 2 CH-53s (''Knife 51 and 52'') whose mission had been search and rescue — the last available helicopters — were reassigned to carry troops.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|251}} The five helicopters picked up 127 Marines of the second wave at U-Tapao between 09:00 and 10:00 hours.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|211–212}} At 11:50 ''Knife 52'', ''Knife 51'' and ''Jolly Green 43'' arrived over Koh Tang and prepared to land on the East Beach, as ''Knife 52'' approached fire punctured its fuel tanks and the pilot aborted the landing and headed back to U-Tapao leaking fuel. ''Knife 51'' and ''Jolly Green 43'' also abandoned their landings and assumed a holding pattern.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|213–214}}

===Release of ''Mayaguez''{{'}}s crew===
At 06:07 the Khmer Rouge information and propaganda minister, Hu Nim, made a radio broadcast announcing that ''Mayaguez'' and her crew would be released. The section of his communique on the release was:

{{quote|Regarding the ''Mayaguez'' ship. We have no intention of detaining it permanently and we have no desire to stage provocations. We only wanted to know the reason for its coming and to warn it against violating our waters again. This is why our coast guard seized this ship. Their goal was to examine it, question it and make a report to higher authorities who would then report to the [[Kingdom of Cambodia (1975–1976)|Royal Government]] so that the Royal Government could itself decide to order it to withdraw from Cambodia's territorial waters and warn it against conducting further espionage and protractive activities. This applies to this ''Mayaguez'' ship and to any other vessels like the ship flying Panama flags that we released on May 7, 1975.&lt;ref name=mlr82-behuniak/&gt;{{rp|162–166}}}}

The transmission was intercepted by the CIA station in [[Bangkok]], translated and delivered to the White House by 07:15 (20:15 EDT).&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|189–190}} The White House was skeptical of the Khmer Rouge message and released a press statement at 08:15 (21:15 EDT) saying that U.S. military operations would continue until the crew of ''Mayaguez'' was released. Secretary Kissinger had ordered a delay to an airstrike by planes from ''Coral Sea'' on the [[Kompong Som]] oil storage complex and [[Sihanoukville International Airport|Ream airfield]].&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|190–193}} At 06:30 on Koh Rong Sanloem the crew of ''Mayaguez'' were informed that they would be allowed to return to their ship, after having first agreed to a statement that they had not been mistreated.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|179–183}} At 07:15 ''Mayaguez''{{'}}s crew was loaded aboard the Thai fishing boat, ''Sinvari'' (which had herself been captured by the Khmer Rouge five months earlier) escorted by a second boat with Sa Mean and other Khmer Rouge. Once away from [[Koh Rong Sanloem]] the second boat picked up the Khmer Rouge guards from ''Sinvari'' and instructed the crew to return to ''Mayaguez'' and call off the American planes.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|197–199}} At 09:35 an orbiting P-3 Orion spotted ''Sinvari'' and ''Wilson'' was ordered to intercept her, originally thinking she was a Khmer Rouge gunboat. The P-3 then identified that Caucasians were aboard and at 09:49 ''Mayaguez''{{'}}s crew was brought aboard ''Wilson''. Confirmation of the release of the crew was sent to the White House and at 11:27 (00:27 EDT) President Ford went on U.S. national television announcing the recovery of  ''Mayaguez'' and the rescue of her crew, but obscuring the fact that the crew had in fact been released by the Khmer Rouge.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|199–201}}&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|204–207}}

President Ford, at Secretary Kissinger's urging, declined to cancel the scheduled airstrikes on the Cambodian mainland until the Marines on Koh Tang had been withdrawn.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|206}} At 09:05 [[Grumman A-6 Intruder#A-6A|A-6A]] and [[LTV A-7 Corsair II#A-7|A-7E]] aircraft from [[VFA-22|VA-22]], [[VFA-94|VA-94]] and [[Attack Squadron 95 (U.S. Navy)|VA-95]] escorted by [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II#United States Navy|F-4N fighters]] of [[VF-51]] and [[VF-111]] aboard ''Coral Sea'' began the airstrikes, bombing landing barges and oil storage facilities at Kompong Som and cargo planes and [[North American T-28 Trojan|T-28 Trojan aircraft]] at Ream airfield and boats at Ream naval base.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|193}}

===Extraction of U.S. Marine elements===

[[File:Marines board JG11 to evacuate Eastern LZ.jpg|thumb|Marines of 3rd Platoon, Company G board ''Jolly Green 11'' to evacuate the Eastern LZ]]
The [[U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff]] decided that, with the ship recaptured and the crew released, further reinforcement of Koh Tang was unnecessary and at 11:55 they ordered the U.S. forces to "immediately cease all offensive operations against the Khmer Republic [and to] disengage and withdraw all forces from operating areas as soon as possible". Hearing this order, the orbiting EC-130 ''Cricket'' recalled the second assault wave. The helicopters with the second wave reversed course until Lt. Col. Austin, on the ground on Koh Tang, convinced the commander of the Seventh Air Force that the reinforcements were necessary to prevent his units from being overrun; the order was rescinded at 12:10.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|214–215}}

The second wave carrying the Marines from ''Knife 22'' and a platoon from Company E had originally taken off at staggered times between 09:00 and 10:00, but with the reversal of course its arrival on Koh Tang was seriously delayed.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|252}} At 12:10 ''Knife 51'', followed by ''Jolly Greens 43, 11 and 12'' successfully landed 100 additional Marines and evacuated nine wounded on the West Beach, making a total of 225 Marines - 205 on the West Beach and 20 Marines and five airmen on the East Beach.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|257}} Around the same time Lt. Col Austin's isolated command unit planned a linkup of its small contingent with the bulk of Golf Company at the northern end of the West Beach. Using mortar fire and [[A-7 Corsair II|A-7]] airstrikes to clear Khmer Rouge in the jungle between the two forces, it reached the Golf Company perimeter at 12:45.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|215–217}}

By 14:00 firing on the West Beach had reduced substantially as Em Son had moved most of his men back from the beaches with only three man patrols maintaining pressure on the two Marine enclaves. Lt. Col Austin asked the ''Cricket'' if he should attempt to push across the island to link up with the isolated unit on the East Beach, but was advised that another helicopter pickup would be attempted first.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|218–224}} At 14:15 ''Jolly Greens 11 and 43'' approached East Beach, but were repulsed by heavy fire. ''Jolly Green 43'' had a fuel line damaged, but made an emergency landing aboard ''Coral Sea'' at 14:36, where it was repaired and returned to service by 17:00 hours.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|258}} During the attempted landing by ''Jolly Green 43'', fire was seen coming from a semi-submerged Swift Boat that had been shot up by an AC-130 the previous day, A-7 aircraft were called in to destroy the boat with their 20&amp;nbsp;mm cannon.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|225–226}} At 16:20 hours, ''Nail 68'', an Air Force [[OV-10]] [[Forward air control]] (FAC) aircraft, arrived and took over the direction of air support. At 16:23 ''Nail 68'' called on ''Wilson'' to use its 5-inch gun to destroy the semi-submerged Swift Boat.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|228}} This change in controllers marked a turning point in the quality of airborne firepower available to the Marines, because for the first time that day they had an airborne observer exclusively dedicated to providing accurate and timely close air support.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|257}} At 17:00 Em Son gathered his forces and moved back up the island to secure an ammunition dump that lay between the West and East Beaches. He was surprised to find the dump intact and no Marines lying in ambush. Now resupplied, his men would be able to increase the pressure on the Marines again.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|229–231}}

At 18:00 as the sun began setting a third attempt to rescue the East Beach force was attempted, using ''Jolly Green 11'' as the rescue ship and with gunfire support from ''Jolly Green 12'', ''Knife 51'' and the gig from ''Wilson'' mounting four [[M60 machine gun|M60]]s. ''Nail 68'' first ordered gun runs by an AC-130 followed by F-4s and A-7s along the edge of the East Beach, as this was going on five C-130s arrived over Koh Tang carrying [[BLU-82|BLU-82 "daisy cutter"]] bombs — a 15,000-pound device and the largest conventional explosive weapon in the U.S. arsenal at the time. Not seeing any practical use for the BLU-82s, ''Nail 68'' ordered them dropped well south of the Marines' positions. At 18:15 ''Jolly Green 11'' approached the East Beach, but did not actually set down because the hulk of ''Knife 23'' was sitting on the beach; instead, the pilot (1LT [[Donald Backlund]]) skilfully hovered the helicopter several feet off the ground just north of the original beach LZ. The extraction was difficult because the helicopter would see-saw up and down. Only a few Marines at a time could board the helicopter's rear ramp in this fashion by timing their jumps to coincide with the downward motion of the aircraft. ''Jolly Green 11'' was hit numerous times, but managed to transport its cargo of 20 Marines and five Airmen to the ''Coral Sea''.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|258}} Shortly after ''Jolly Green 11'' evacuated the East Beach, the first BLU-82 was dropped causing a huge explosion and sending a shockwave across the West Beach, Lt. Col Austin quickly called the ''Cricket'' with the instruction that no more of the bombs should be dropped.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|231–235}} A report from ''Jolly Green 11'' indicated that a Marine might be in the wreckage of ''Knife 31'' and ''Jolly Green 12'' went in to search for any survivors, ''Jolly Green 12'' hovered above the wreck, while a crewman was lowered on a rescue hoist to survey the wreckage, no Marine was recovered and ''Jolly Green 12'' suffered extensive damage in the rescue attempt and flew to ''Coral Sea''.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|235}}&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|259}}

As a moonless night fell over Koh Tang, the remaining two helicopters, ''Knife 51'' and the hastily repaired ''Jolly Green 43'', were joined by ''Jolly Green 44'' that had been out of service at its [[Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base|Nakhon Phanom base]] but had been repaired and flown to the area. At 18:40 this force began to withdraw the remaining 205 Marines from the West Beach, protected by AC-130 fire and naval gunfire support from ''Henry B. Wilson'' and her gig. The first load of 41 Marines was lifted out at 18:40 hours by ''Knife 51'' and flown to the ''Coral Sea'', followed by 54 taken aboard ''Jolly Green 43''. As ''Jolly Green 44'' picked up a load of 44 Marines, the remaining Marines in the shrinking West Beach perimeter came under intense attack and were in danger of being overrun. The round trip to ''Coral Sea'' took thirty minutes, so the pilot, 1LT Bob Blough, decided to deliver his Marines to ''Harold E. Holt'', the nearest ship to Koh Tang, in complete darkness while hovering the helicopter over the ship with only its front wheels touching down. Within five minutes ''Jolly Green 44'' returned and picked up 34 more Marines, leaving 32 still on the island; ''Jolly Green 44'' was suffering engine trouble and this time headed for ''Coral Sea''.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|238–243}}

Finally at 20:00 ''Knife 51'' landed and began loading in the dark and under fire. Having loaded everyone save for themselves, Captain Davis and Gunnery Sergeant McNemar combed the beach looking for stragglers. ''Knife 51'' Pararescueman TSGT [[Wayne Fisk]] was at the end of the ramp when two more Marines stumbled out of the darkness, TSGT Fisk asked Captain Davis if all his men were aboard and he confirmed they were, but TSGT Fisk combed the beach one last time for stragglers. Finding none, he leaped onto the hovering CH-53 and at 20:10 ''Knife 51'' left Koh Tang for the ''Coral Sea''.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|243–248}}&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|262}}

===U.S. Marines left behind and subsequent controversy===
Due to the intense direct and indirect fire during the operation, the bodies of Marines and airmen who were killed in action were left where they fell including Lance Corporal Ashton Loney, whose body was left behind in the darkness during the evacuation of the West Beach.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|238–240}}

With each withdrawal, the Marines contracted their perimeter on the West Beach. Lance Corporal John S. Standfast, squad leader, 3rd Squad, 3rd Platoon, Company E and his squad covered Company G's withdrawal during the reduction of the perimeter, and he then singlehandedly directed the pullback of his own squad. Before withdrawing to the safety of the new perimeter, Standfast and his platoon guide Sergeant Andersen would move forward to the old perimeter to ensure that no member of the company inadvertently had been left behind, each time checking every foxhole. As the Company E commander Captain Mykle E. Stahl prepared to board ''Jolly Green 44'' he informed Captain Davis that all of his men were inside the perimeter, not realising that three Marines of an [[M60 machine gun]] team had set up a firing position behind a rocky outcrop beyond the right flank of the perimeter.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|239–240}}&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|262}}

Even as ''Knife 51'' left the West Beach, there was confusion as to whether any Marines remained on Koh Tang. The pilot, Lieutenant Brims, radioed the FAC that some Marines aboard claimed there were still fellow Marines on the ground, but this was soon contradicted by Captain Davis who said that all Marines were off Koh Tang.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|248}} Two hours after the evacuation was completed, with the Koh Tang Marines dispersed among three Navy ships, Company E commander Captain Stahl discovered that three of his Marines were missing. The Marines checked all of the Navy ships but could not locate [[Lance Corporal]] Joseph N. Hargrove, [[Private First Class|PFC]] Gary L. Hall, and [[Private (rank)|Pvt]] Danny G. Marshall, members of a three-man machine gun team which had been assigned to protect the right flank of the constantly shrinking perimeter during the final evacuation.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|254}} Sergeant Andersen was the last member of the Marine force to see Hall, Hargrove, and Marshall alive at about 20:00 when he ordered them to move back to a new position which was located to the left of the position occupied by Captain Davis.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|239}}&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|263}}

A rescue operation was proposed using Marine volunteers aboard the only three serviceable helicopters. On ''Coral Sea'' the Commander of Task Force 73, Rear Admiral R. T. Coogan met with Lt. Col Austin and Captain Davis, Gunnery Sergeant McNemar and Lieutenant Coulter who had just arrived from Subic Bay with a 14-man [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEAL]] team to consider possible options. Admiral Coogan asked Lt. Coulter to take ''Wilson''{{'}}s gig ashore in daylight unarmed under a white flag with leaflets dropped and ''Wilson'' broadcasting the crew's intentions to recover the American bodies and determine the status of the missing men if possible, but Lt. Coulter was skeptical and instead proposed taking his team ashore for a night reconnaissance, but this was refused by Admiral Coogan. Admiral Coogan had to weigh up the order from Seventh Fleet to cease hostile actions against the Khmer Rouge against the lack of evidence that any of the men were still alive, he decided that there would be no rescue mission unless there was some confirmation that the three Marines were still alive.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|254–255}} The following morning ''Wilson'' cruised back and forth between the West and East Beaches for three hours broadcasting messages in English, French and Khmer saying that they had no hostile intent, but simply wished to retrieve any U.S. personnel dead or alive on the Koh Tang and would send an unarmed boat ashore if the Khmer Rouge signalled them. Half of ''Wilson''{{'}}s crew was on deck scanning the beaches and jungle for any sign of the missing Marines, but no signal was received from the Khmer Rouge or the missing Marines. With no indication that the three Marines were still alive and the certainty that more lives would be lost in any forced rescue attempt, a return to Koh Tang was ruled out and ''Wilson'' departed the area.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|255–256}} Hargrove, Hall, and Marshall were declared Missing in Action and then on 21 July 1976 their status was changed to Killed in Action (Body Not Recovered).&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|265–266}}

In 1985, an eyewitness report indicated that a wounded American had been captured on Koh Tang after the assault and was subsequently executed.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|16}} The NSA intercepted Cambodian messages which referred to 'the American that was captured' with orders not to talk about this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/vietnam_powmia_docs/reference_numbers/doc_1617.pdf|title=Cambodia Reports Capture of American Personnel|publisher=nsa.gov|date=5 May 1978|accessdate=16 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918105645/https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/vietnam_powmia_docs/reference_numbers/doc_1617.pdf|archivedate=18 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 Em Son approached the [[Joint Task Force-Full Accounting]] (JTF-FA) on learning that they were looking for further information regarding the events on Koh Tang.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|277}} Em Son advised that on the morning on 16 May he ordered his men to search the West Beach for any remaining Americans. About 100&amp;nbsp;m from the beach one of the Khmer Rouge was hit by M16 fire. The Khmer Rouge then fired mortars and encircled the firing position, capturing one American with a leg wound. Em Son's description of the American matched that of Lance Corporal Joseph Hargrove. The Khmer Rouge continued their search and located an abandoned M60 machine gun, various equipment and the covered body of a black American soldier. Em Son ordered the dead American (presumably Lance Corporal Ashton Loney) buried and the prisoner taken to his H.Q. When Em Son was advised that the Khmer Rouge hit by M16 fire had died, he ordered the American to be shot.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|281–286}}&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Matthew M., "[http://www.stripes.com/fate-of-marines-left-behind-in-cambodia-in-1975-haunts-comrades-1.214568 Fate of Marines left behind in Cambodia in 1975 haunts comrades]", ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'', 4 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately one week after the assault, Em Son's men noticed that their leftover food was being disturbed and on searching they found bootprints in the mud. They set up a night ambush and on the third night they captured two Americans matching the descriptions of PFC Gary Hall and Pvt Danny Marshall. Em Son radioed Kampong Som and was ordered to deliver the Americans to the mainland. The following morning the two Americans were taken by boat to the mainland and then driven to the [[Ti Nean Pagoda]] above Sihanoukville where they were stripped to their underwear and shackled. After one week, on orders from Phnom Penh, each American was beaten to death with a [[B-40 rocket|B-40 rocket launcher]]. Hall's body was buried in a shallow grave near the beach. Marshall's was dumped on the beach cove.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|286–289}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mca-marines.org/leatherneck/secrets-koh-tang|title=Where the Search for MIAs, and How They Died in the Last Action of the Vietnam War, Continues|work=Leatherneck|date=May 2001|author=Ralph F.

Recovery efforts in 1999 by the JTF-FA later found bone fragments that might have belonged to Hall and Marshall, but [[DNA test]]s proved inconclusive due to the small size of the fragments.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|293–297}} Hargrove, Hall, and Marshall all received [[Purple Heart]]s from the U.S. Marine Corps. Hargrove's family did not receive the award until 1999, after investigative journalist and author [[Ralph Wetterhahn]] published several articles in popular magazines about his findings.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|268}}

In 2007, Hargrove's cousin, Cary Turner, began a campaign to have Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC), the successor agency to JTF-FA, return to Koh Tang to search for Hargrove's remains. In October 2008 JPAC was reported to have found four sets of remains in an area indicated by Em Son as being where the American suspected to be Hargrove was buried. One of the sets of remains was said to be Caucasian in nature, but DNA analysis was needed before the identity could be confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jdnews.com/news/hargrove-63609-left-spent.html|title=Left behind but not forgotten|publisher=JD News|date=13 April 2009|author=Molly DeWitt|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518073348/http://www.jdnews.com/news/hargrove-63609-left-spent.html|archivedate=18 May 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1991 and 1999, U.S. and Cambodian investigators conducted seven joint investigations, led by the [[Joint Task Force-Full Accounting]]. On three occasions Cambodian authorities unilaterally turned over remains believed to be those of American servicemen. In October and November 1995, U.S. and Cambodian specialists conducted an underwater recovery of the ''Knife 31'' crash site where they located numerous remains, personal effects and aircraft debris associated with the loss. {{USS|Brunswick|ATS-3|6}}, a U.S. Navy salvage vessel, enabled the specialists to conduct their excavation offshore. In addition to the support provided by the Cambodian government, the Government of Vietnam also interviewed two Vietnamese informants in Ho Chi Minh City who turned over remains that were later positively identified. As a result of these investigations the remains of 2LT Richard Vandegeer, LCPL Gregory S Copenhaver, LCPL Andres Garcia, PFC Lynn Blessing, PFC Walter Boyd, PFC Antonio R Sandoval and PFC Kelton R. Turner were identified.&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|316–324}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dpmo/news/2000/000518_osd_pr260_sea_mayaguez.htm

===Impact on Thailand===
The "''Mayaguez'' incident" had a direct effect on the political situation in Thailand, as news of the operation reached Bangkok protests began outside the [[Embassy of the United States, Bangkok|U.S. Embassy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=886&amp;dat=19750518&amp;id=nqdMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5071,1737577 |title=Thai students attack embassy |work=Associated Press |publisher=The Prescott Courier |date=18 May 1975 |accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U-Tapao air base had been used by U.S. rescue forces despite an explicit refusal of permission by the relatively new civilian Thai government&lt;ref name=mlr82-behuniak/&gt;{{rp|55–60}} (after being refused by the Thai government, the US sought and obtained permission from the Thai military to proceed), resulting in considerable anger towards the United States. The Thai government called the act a violation of Thailand's sovereignty and called for the immediate withdrawal of all U.S. forces from U-Tapao.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|256}}

===Congressional consultation===
Some congressmen were dissatisfied with the level of consultation they received under the [[War Powers Resolution]]. Senator [[Mike Mansfield]] was the most critical, saying "we were informed, not consulted". Senator [[Thomas Eagleton]] introduced an amendment to the War Powers Resolution that added the rescue of nationals to the list of situations not requiring prior approval by Congress, but also stipulating that only minimum force would be used in rescue.&lt;ref name=mlr82-behuniak/&gt;{{rp|46,60–63,72–73,168–170}}

On June 23, 1975, the House of Representatives [[United States House Committee on International Relations|Subcommittee on International Political and Military Affairs]] asked the [[General Accounting Office]] to review all aspects of the incident. On the War Powers Resolution, the General Accounting Office report's assessment was "The available evidence suggests less than full compliance with Section 3 [of the War Powers Resolution]."&lt;ref name=gao-B133001&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/products/A02828 |title=The Seizure of the Mayaguez - A Case Study of Crisis Management |publisher=General Accounting Office |id=B-133001 |date=11 May 1976 |accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal action by crew===
Some crew members brought lawsuits in [[admiralty law]] at the [[San Francisco Superior Court]] against [[Sea-Land Service|Sea-Land Service Inc]] relating to the incident. The crew members claimed that the defendant's Master was derelict in his duty by "recklessly venturing into known dangerous and hostile waters of foreign sovereignty (Cambodia)" inviting the capture. Evidence was provided that ''Mayaguez'' was not flying a flag, and had sailed about two nautical miles off Poulo Wai. In June 1977, a settlement was reached. In February 1979 another settlement was reached by other crew members, making a total settlement of $388,000 to the crew members taking legal action.&lt;ref name=paust-1981&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1576&amp;context=iclr |title=More Revelations About Mayaguez (and its Secret Cargo) |author=Jordan J. Paust |journal=Boston College International and Comparative Law Review |volume=4 |issue=1 |year=1981 |accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on U.S. military rescue planning===
The U.S. military received much criticism for its handling of the incident.&lt;ref name=starnes-1995&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a293264.pdf |title=The Mayaguez incident : a failure in operational leadership |author=Major Glenn T Starnes |publisher=Naval War College |year=1995 |accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the failure of intelligence to determine the whereabouts of the crew of ''Mayaguez'' and the presence of a sizable hostile force on Koh Tang, the timing of the operation was questioned until it became clear that combat had been underway four hours before the crew was released. Within the services, the Marines in particular were critical of the ''ad hoc'' nature of the joint operation and the perceived pressure from the Administration for hasty action,&lt;ref name=toal-1998&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a529638.pdf |title=The Mayaguez Incident: Near Disaster at Koh Tang |author=Major Mark J. Toal |publisher=Marine Corps War College |year=1998 |accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the success of [[Operation Frequent Wind]] had been the basis for many decisions made during the crisis. Vice Admiral George P. Steele, the Seventh Fleet commander, later stated that: "The sad part of the ''Mayaguez'' is that we had sufficient force coming up with the Seventh Fleet, after it had been turned around from the evacuation of Vietnam stand down, to seize Southern Cambodia. I begged for another day or two, rather than commit forces piecemeal as we did .... The idea that we could use U.S. Air Force air police and Air Force helicopters as an assault force appears to me as ridiculous today as it did then."&lt;ref name=Dunham/&gt;{{rp|239}}

When many of the coordination and communications problems arose again during [[Operation Eagle Claw]], the hostage rescue mission in [[Iran]] in 1980, significant changes in joint and special operations were brought about.&lt;ref name=Wetterhahn/&gt;{{rp|313}}

===Memorials===
In 1996 the ''Mayaguez''-Marine Corps Memorial was dedicated in the grounds of the U.S. embassy in Phnom Penh by then Ambassador [[Kenneth M. Quinn]] and Senator [[John McCain]]. The memorial lists the names of the 18 U.S. servicemembers killed and missing at Koh Tang and [[Marine Security Guard]] Sergeant Charles "Wayne" Turberville killed in a Khmer Rouge grenade attack on 26 September 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.usembassy.gov/todd/honoring-the-past/|title=Honoring the Past|publisher=usembassy.gov|date=10 April 2013|accessdate=4 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707231204/http://blogs.usembassy.gov/todd/honoring-the-past/|archivedate=7 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ''Mayaguez'' incident is often referred to as the last battle of the [[Vietnam War]], U.S. military personnel who participated in it are not eligible for the [[Vietnam Service Medal]] by virtue of participating in that battle alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kohtang.com/presidents-page/presidents-page.html|title=Mayaguez Recovery Presidents Page|date=2 March 2017|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302104319/http://www.kohtang.com/presidents-page/presidents-page.html|archivedate=2 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal]] is authorized instead for military members who participated in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crazyhorseap.be/Mustangs/Aces/Armed%20Forces%20Expeditionary%20Medal.html|title=Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal|website=Crazyhorseap.be|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A congressional bill was introduced in 2016 to award veterans of the ''Mayaguez'' battle the medal, but the bill was referred to committee, effectively ending it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/6374/text|title=H.R.6374 - Recognizing Mayaguez Veterans Act|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Paramaccan''' are a [[Bushinengue]] ethnic group living in the forested interior of [[Suriname]], mainly in the [[Marowijne District]].

It is also the eponymous term for their language, which is [[English language|English]]-based with influences from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and other languages. It is similar to the languages spoken by the [[Aluku]] and [[Kwinti]].

It has less than 1,000 speakers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The '''Indonesian Marhaen People's Union''' ({{lang-id|Persatuan Rakyat Marhaen Indonesia}}), generally known by its acronym '''Permai''' (meaning 'beautiful'), was a social movement in [[Indonesia]], functioning both as a [[political party]] and an [[Abangan]] mystical association.&lt;ref name="myst"/&gt; The organisation was founded on 17 December 1945.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tJahSbd9aesCIPS Terpadu (Sosiologi, Geografi, Ekonomi, Sejarah)]''. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Permai was led by Mei Kartawinata.&lt;ref name="dec"&gt;Feith, Herbert.

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Selection 060.png|frame|Permai's Logo in 1955 Election]] --&gt;Permai called its doctrine [[Marhaenism]]. It beliefs were said to have been revealed to the Permai founder during meditation.&lt;ref name="rel1"&gt;Geertz. pp. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt; The movement claimed to practice 'pure native science', i.e. pre-[[Hinduism|Hindu]] and pre-Islamic 'original' Javanese beliefs. This set of ideas was combined with support for Indonesian [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] [[nationalism]]. Permai was strongly opposed to [[Islam]], arguing that it was a foreign religion, in contradiction to Javanese culture and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Islam, Mazharul.

The outspoken anti-Islamic profile of Permai brought it into collision with Islamist political forces. In 1954 mass protests were launched against statements made by the Permai leader Mei Kartawinata. According to some accounts, these protests mustered half a million participants.&lt;ref name="dec"/&gt; Also, the holding of Permai weddings and funerals provoked clashes with Muslim organizations (Permai was not a recognized religion, and thus these ceremonies had no official stature).&lt;ref&gt;Geertz. p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Permai obtained 149,287 votes in the [[Indonesian legislative election, 1955|1955 legislative election]] (0.4% of the national vote), and won a seat in the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Feith, Herbert.

The '''precarium''' (plural '''precaria''')—or '''precaria''' (plural '''precariae''') in the feminine form—is a form of [[land tenure]] in which a petitioner (grantee) receives a property for a specific amount of time without any change of ownership.&lt;ref name="catholic"&gt;Boudinhon, A. (1911). Precaria. In The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved August 6, 2013 from New Advent: http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12371b.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The precarium is thus a free gift made on request (or ''precarius'', whence "prayer") and can be revoked. The grantor can reclaim the land and evict the grantee at any time, and the grantee's hold on the land is said to be "precarious". (The adjectival form "precarial" is also used.) The precarium arose in the [[late Roman Empire]]. In the [[Middle Ages]] it became a legal fiction, and the two parties usually signed a contract specifying the rent or services owed by the petitioner. Some precaria eventually became hereditary [[fief]]s. In the [[Merovingian]] period the feminine form (singular ''precaria'') became common, but in the eighth century the term ''[[Benefice|beneficium]]'' began to replace ''precarium'', although the institutions were practically identical.&lt;ref&gt;John Beeler, ''Warfare in Feudal Europe, 730–1200'' (Cornell University Press, 1971), 3–6, contains a good discussion of precaria.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecclesiastical use==
Precarium is discussed in the legal digests of [[Justinian]], and seems to have existed in 6th century [[Visigothic Spain]] and France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PG4lxNNLz3YC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45 ''Property and Power in the Early Middle Ages'' By Wendy Davies and Paul Fouracre'', p. 45]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[feudalism]], the use of church lands to support warriors contributed to the growth of precaria in the eighth century in Catholic Europe. Modern historians have sometimes called these lands [[fief]]s; however, to the extent that they were church property and not property of the lord or king&amp;mdash;although that was a flexible distinction in the ninth and tenth centuries&amp;mdash;they were not fiefs. The distinction was between the right of ownership in the ecclesiastical manner (''jure proprio et more ecclesiastico''), which remained with the church, and the right of benefit and usufruct (''jure beneficiario et usufructuario''), which was ceded away.&lt;ref name=GC&gt;[[Giles Constable]], "''Nona et Decima'': An Aspect of Carolingian Economy", ''Speculum'', 35:2 (1960), pp. 224–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[lord]] or [[monarch|king]] often paid a fixed rent annually to the church or monastery for the land. This was usually expressed as a proportion of the revenue generated by the property, typicall a "ninth and tenth" (''nona et decima''), that is, a tenth of the original produce and then a ninth of what remained—the equivalent of a fifth of the original total. The [[vassal]] or knight using the land did not hold it outright, but during the lord's pleasure he enjoyed all the profits and advantages of the land and its buildings, normally intended to supply the wherewithal required to maintain him and his retinue.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

If the church did not have enough funds to stay out of poverty the entire land under precaria could be restored to the church.  Precaria not only refers to the contract, but also the land under the contract, the [[benefice]] (although the term benefice is also used to describe similar but non-religious circumstances).

'''Public capital''' is the aggregate body of government-owned assets that are used as a means for productivity.&lt;ref name="Why is Infrastructure important?"&gt;Aschauer, D. A. (1990). Why is infrastructure important? Conference Series [Proceedings]. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Pp. 21-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Such assets span a wide range including: large components such as [[highways]], [[airports]], [[roads]], [[transit system]]s, and [[railways]]; local, municipal components such as [[public education]], [[hospital|public hospitals]], [[police]] and [[fire protection]], [[prisons]], and [[courts]]; and critical components including [[Water supply network|water]] and [[Sewage collection and disposal|sewer systems]], [[Electric utility|public electric]] and [[Public utility|gas utilities]], and [[telecommunications]].&lt;ref name="Public Capital Formation"&gt;Tatam, J. A. (1993). The Spurious Effect of Public Capital Formation on Private Sector Productivity. Policy Studies Journal, Vol. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Often, public capital is defined as government outlay, in terms of money, and as physical stock, in terms of infrastructure.

==Current state in the U.S.==

In 1988, the U.S. [[Infrastructure|infrastructure system]] including all public and private non-residential capital stock was valued at $7 trillion, an immense portfolio to operate and manage.&lt;ref&gt;Pietroforte, R., &amp; Miller, J. (2002). Procurement methods for US infrastructure: historical perspectives and recent trends. Journal of Building Research &amp; Information, 30(6), 425-434.&lt;/ref&gt; And according to the Congressional Budget Office, in 2004 the U.S. invested $400 billion in infrastructure capital across federal, state, and local levels including the private sectors on transportation networks, schools, highways, water systems, energy, and telecommunications services. While public spending on infrastructure grew by 1.7% annually between 1956 and 2004, it has remained constant as a share of GDP since early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Orszag, P. R. (2008). Investing in Infrastructure. Washington, DC: Congressional Budget Office.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the value and investment of public capital, growing delays in [[aviation|air]] and [[transport|surface transportation]], aging [[electric grid]], an untapped [[renewable energy]] sector, and inadequate school facilities all have justified additional funding in public capital investment. 

The [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] have continued to give low marks, averaging a D grade, for the nation’s infrastructure since its inception of the Report Card in 1998. In 2009, each category of infrastructure varied from C+ to D- grades with an estimated $2.2 trillion of needed public capital investment. The [[aviation]] sector remains mired in continued delays in the reauthorization of federal programs and an outdated [[air traffic control]] system. One in four rural [[bridge]]s and one in three urban bridges are structurally deficient. States are understaffed and underfunded to conduct safety inspections of [[dams]]. Texas alone has only seven engineers and an annual budget of $435,000 to oversee more than 7,400 dams. [[Electricity]] demand outpaces energy supply transmission and generation. Almost half of the [[Lock (water transport)|water locks]] maintained by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] are functionally obsolete. [[Drinking water]] faces an annual shortfall of $11 billion to manage their aging facilities and comply with federal regulations. Leaking pipes lose an estimated {{convert|7|e9USgal|m3}} of clean drinking water a day. Under tight [[government budget|budgets]], national, state, and local parks suffer neglect. Without adequate funding, rail cannot meet future [[tonnage|freight tonnage]] load. [[Public education|Schools]] require a staggering $127 billion to bring facilities to decent operating condition. Billions of gallons of untreated [[sewage]] continue to be discharged into U.S.’s [[surface water]]s each year.&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Civil Engineers. (2009). Report Card for America’s Infrastructure. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.asce.org/reportcard/2009/grades.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317143614/http://www.asce.org/reportcard/2009/grades.cfm |archivedate=2010-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic growth==

One of the most classic [[macroeconomic]] inquiries is the effect of public capital investment on [[economic growth]]. While many analysts debate the magnitude, evidence has shown a statistically significant positive relationship between infrastructure investment and economic performance.&lt;ref name="Why is Infrastructure important?"/&gt; U.S. [[Federal Reserve]] economist David Alan Aschauer asserted an increase of the public capital stock by 1% would result in an increase of the [[total factor productivity]] by 0.4%.&lt;ref name="Public Capital and Economic Growth"&gt;Haan, J., Romp, W., and Sturum, J.E. (2007). Public Capital and Economic Growth. World Bank, Preliminary Paper.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aschauer argues that the [[Post–World War II economic expansion|golden age of the 1950s and 1960s]] were partly due to the post-[[World War II]] substantial investment in [[critical infrastructure|core infrastructure]] (highways, mass transit, airports, water systems, electric/gas facilities). Conversely, the drop of U.S. productivity growth in [[1973–75 recession|the 1970s]] and [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|1980s]] was in response to the decrease of continual public capital investment and not the decline of technological innovation.&lt;ref name="Why is Infrastructure important?"/&gt; Likewise, the [[European Union]] nations have declined public capital investment through the same years, also witnessing declining [[productivity growth]] rates.&lt;ref name="Public Capital and Economic Growth"/&gt; A similar situation emerges in [[developing nations]]. Analyzing [[OECD]] and non-OECD countries’ real-GDP growth rates from 1960 to 2000 with public capital as an explanatory variable (not using public investment rates), Arslanalp, Borhorst, Gupta, and Sze (2010) show that increases in the public capital stock does correlate with increases in growth. However, this relationship depends on initial levels of public capital and income levels for the country. Thus, OECD countries witness a stronger positive link in the short term while non-OECD countries experience a stronger positive link in the long term. Hence, developing countries can benefit from non-concessional foreign borrowing to finance high-prospect public capital investments.&lt;ref name="Public Capital and Growth, International Monetary Fund"&gt;Arslanalp, S., Borhorst, F., Gupta, S., and Sze, E. (2010). Public Capital and Growth. International Monetary Fund: Fiscal Affairs Department, Working Paper. Pp. 1-35. http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2010/wp10175.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Given this relationship of public capital and productivity, public capital becomes a third [[factor of production|input]] in the standard, [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] [[production function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\qquad\qquad Y_t = A_t * (N_t, K_t, G_t) &lt;/math&gt;

where: 
:''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; represents real aggregate output of goods and services of the private sector
:''A''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; represents productivity factor or Hicks-Neutral technical change
:''N''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; represents aggregate employment of labor services
:''K''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; represents aggregate stock of nonresidential capital
:''G''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; represents flow of public capital stock (assuming services of public capital are proportional to public capital)&lt;ref&gt;Aschauer, D. A. (1989). Is Public Expenditure Productive? Journal of Monetary Economics, Vol. 23. Pp. 177-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this form, public capital has a direct influence on productivity as a third variable. Additionally, public capital has an indirect influence on [[multifactor productivity]] as it affects the other two inputs of labor and [[private capital]].&lt;ref&gt;Eberts, R. (1990). Public infrastructure and regional economic development. Economic Review (00130281), 26(1), 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this unique nature, public capital investment, used in the production process of nearly every sector, is not sufficient on its own to generate sustained economic growth.&lt;ref name="Public Capital and Economic Growth"/&gt; Thus, rather than the ends, public capital is the means. That is, instead of being seen as [[intermediate good]]s used as resources by businesses, public capital should be seen as goods which are used to make the [[final goods]] and services to consumers-taxpayers.&lt;ref name="Public Capital Formation"/&gt; Note that public capital levels should not be too high that it leads to financing costs and high tax rates issues which will negate the positive benefits of such investments.&lt;ref name="Public Capital and Growth, International Monetary Fund"/&gt; Moreover, infrastructure services carry the market-distorting features of pure, non-rival [[public goods]]; [[Network effect|network externalities]]; [[natural monopolies]]; and the [[Common-pool resource|common resource]] problem such as congestion and overuse.&lt;ref name="Public Capital and Economic Growth"/&gt;

Empirical models that attempt to estimate the public investment and economic growth link involve a wide variety including: the [[Cobb-Douglas]] production function; a behavioral approach [[Cost curve|cost]]/[[Profit (economics)|profit]] function which includes public capital stock; [[Vector autoregression|Vector Auto Regression]] (VAR) models; and government investment growth [[regression analysis|regression]]s. These models nonetheless contend with [[reverse causation|reverse causality]], [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneity]], [[Endogeneity (economics)|endogeneity]], and [[Nonlinear system|nonlinearities]] in trying to capture the public capital and economic growth link.&lt;ref name="Public Capital and Economic Growth"/&gt; [[New Keynesian]] models, though, analyze the effect of government spending through the supply side rather than traditional [[Keynesian]] models that analyzes it through the demand side. Therefore, a temporary surge of infrastructure investment yields an expansion of output, and vice versa that dwindling infrastructure, like in the 1970s, hamper longer-term movement in productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Crain, W.M. and Oakley, L.K. (1995) The Politics of Infrastructure. Journal of Law and Economics Vol. 38, no. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, new research on regional growth (as opposed to national growth with GDP) shows a strong positive relationship between public capital and productivity. Both [[fixed costs]] and [[transport]] costs lower with expanded infrastructure in localities and the resulting cluster of industries. As a result, economic activity grows along its pattern of trade.&lt;ref name="Public Capital and Economic Growth"/&gt; Therefore, the importance of [[business cluster|regional clusters]] and [[metropolitan economy|metropolitan economies]] comes into effect.

==Social benefit==

Beyond economic performance, public capital investment yields returns in [[quality of life]] indicators such as [[health]], [[safety]], [[recreation]], [[aesthetics]], and [[leisure|leisure time and activities]]. In example, highways provide better access and mobility for increased discretionary time and [[recreation|recreational outlets]]; [[mass transit]] can improve air quality with reduced number of private vehicles; improved municipal waste facilities reduces toxic [[Water pollution|groundwater contamination]] and better [[Open space reserve|green space]] aesthetics such as [[parks]]; expanded water facilities aids in health and sanitation and environment such as reducing odor and sewer overflows.&lt;ref name="Why is Infrastructure important?"/&gt; Furthermore, infrastructure adds to community ambience and quality of place with livelier [[downtown]]s, vibrant [[:wikt:waterfront|waterfront]]s, efficient [[land use]]s, compact spaces for [[commerce]] and [[recreation]].&lt;ref name="Brookings MetroPolicy: Shaping a New Federal Partnership"&gt;Mark, M., Katz, B., Rahman, S., and  Warren, D. Brookings MetroPolicy: Shaping A New Federal Partnership for a Metropolitan Nation.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the contrary, inadequate public capital impairs quality of life and social well-being. Over-capacity landfills lead to groundwater contamination, having deleterious effects on health. Deficient supply and quality of mass transit services impacts transit-dependents on their access to opportunity and resources. Increasing congestion in airports and roadways causes loss of discretionary time and recreational activities.&lt;ref name="Why is Infrastructure important?"/&gt; The lack of efficient U.S. [[freight]] and [[passenger train|passenger rail]] service will neither aid in handling the “perfect storm” of [[Environmentalism|environmental]] and [[Sustainable energy|energy]] [[sustainability]] nor meet the global competitive need of transporting goods and services at heightened speeds and times.&lt;ref&gt;Puentes, R. (2008). A Bridge to Somewhere: Rethinking American Transportation for the 21st Century. Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Report: Blueprint for American Prosperity series report.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the continued loss of footing in [[clean energy]] technology will contribute to U.S.’s future loss of prosperity on the global stage in terms of the [[carbon footprint]] and [[economy]].&lt;ref name="Brookings MetroPolicy: Shaping a New Federal Partnership"/&gt;

==Public capital initiatives==

===United States===

Perhaps the largest contribution to the [[public works]] system in the U.S. came out of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]’s [[New Deal]] initiatives particularly the creation of the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) in 1935. At a time of a deep economic crisis, the WPA employed at its peak 3.35 millions unemployed heads-of-households to work in rebuilding the country. The program helped construct millions of roads, bridges, parks, schools, hospitals, and levees while also providing educational programs, childcare, job training, and medical services. The overall [[government spending|public spending]] level for the program, unprecedented at the time, was $4.8 billion ($76 billion in 2008 dollars), and helped to stimulate the economy through public works projects.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel, J. (2008). A Twenty-First Century WPA. Social Policy, 38(2), 38-43.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since then, the U.S. has contributed to other large infrastructure programs including the [[Interstate Highway System]], 1956-1990, with a dedicated financing system through the gas tax and a matching contribution between federal government and states at 90% to 10%.&lt;ref&gt;Griggs, F. E. (2003). Perspectives in Civil Engineering. 1852-2002: 150 Years in Civil Engineering in the United States. American Society of Civil Engineers. Edited by Jeffrey S. Russell. Pp. 111-122.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) [[Clean Water Act]] of 1972 provided a public capital investment of $40 billion in constructing and upgrading sewage treatment facilities with “significant positive impacts on the Nation’s water quality.”&lt;ref name="Why is Infrastructure important?"/&gt; Considered by the [[National Academy of Engineering]] to be the greatest engineering achievement of the 20th century, the [[Electric grid|North American electric grid]] carries electricity over {{convert|300,000|mi|km}} on high-voltage [[transmission lines]] across the U.S. Though currently facing aging facilities and equipment, this public capital investment has ubiquitously reached millions of homes and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Stuller, J. (2009). Reinventing Edison. Conference Board Review, 46(1), 42-49. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. (2009). Power to the Plug: An Introduction to Energy, Electricity, Consumption, and Efficiency. Pp. 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] (ARRA) is another example of large public capital investment. Of the $311 billion in appropriations, about $120 billion are set aside for crucial investment in Infrastructure and Science and Energy. Some of ARRA’s aims include [[smart grid]] technology, [[retrofitting]] of homes and federal buildings, automated [[Air traffic control|aviation traffic control]], advancing freight and passenger rail services, and upgrading water and waste facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, R., Bray, J., &amp; Brost, K (2009). United States Congress: The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Retrieved Oct. 20, 2009, from House Appropriations Committee, Washington DC. Web site: http://appropriations.house.gov/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===

Worldwide, transformative public capital investments are taking place. [[China]]’s ambitious rapid [[high-speed rail]] program is estimated to extend 18,000&amp;nbsp;km by 2020. By the end of 2008, the country had a fleet of over 24,000 [[locomotives]], the most lines in the world, the fastest [[express train]] in service, and longest high-speed track in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Felon, C, Ramella, F, and Zuger, H. (2009) China’s Rail Revolution. ABB Review: Railways and Transportation. Vol. 2, Issue 10. Pp. 19-24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Denmark]], and other countries in northern [[Europe]] that surround the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[North Sea]], continue to develop their rapid expansion of [[Wind power|off-shore wind farms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/en/part-3-economics-of-wind-power/chapter-2-offshore-developments/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725100053/http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/en/part-3-economics-of-wind-power/chapter-2-offshore-developments/ |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With continued expansion of terminals and connection to nation’s comprehensive transport system, the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] is one of the largest engineering and architectural projects in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/business/about-the-airport/welcome.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the last decade, [[Chile]] installed five [[Combined cycle|combined cycle gas-turbined]] (CCGT) power plants to meet its nation’s growing energy needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.industcards.com/cc-chile.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126204329/http://www.industcards.com/cc-chile.htm |archivedate=2013-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection between '''race and intelligence''' has been a subject of debate in both [[popular science]] and [[academic research]] since the inception of [[intelligence quotient|IQ]] testing in the early 20th century. There remains some debate as to whether and to what extent differences in intelligence test scores reflect environmental factors as opposed to genetic ones, as well as to the definitions of what "race" and "intelligence" are, and whether they can be objectively defined.  Currently, there is no non-[[circumstantial evidence]] that these differences in test scores have a genetic component, although some researchers believe that the existing circumstantial evidence makes it at least plausible that hard evidence for a genetic component will eventually be found. Still, inferences that intelligence as measured by [[IQ]] are equal among the races when controlled for environmental factors has not yet been conclusively proven with critics largely believing that the Intelligence Quotient itself has inherent biases, and thus that differences are due to a [[cultural bias]].&lt;ref&gt;https://study.com/academy/lesson/cultural-bias-in-testing-examples-definition-quiz.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The first test showing differences in IQ test results between different population groups in the US was the tests of United States Army recruits in World War I. In the 1920s groups of eugenics lobbyists argued that this demonstrated that African-Americans and certain immigrant groups were of inferior intellect to Anglo-Saxon whites due to innate biological differences, using this as an argument for policies of racial segregation. Soon, other studies appeared, contesting these conclusions and arguing instead that the Army tests had not adequately controlled for the environmental factors such as socio-economic and educational [[racial inequality in the United States|inequality between blacks and whites]].

The debate reemerged again in 1969, when [[Arthur Jensen]] championed the view that for genetic reasons Africans were less intelligent than whites and that [[compensatory education]] for African-American children was therefore doomed to be ineffective. In 1994, the book ''[[The Bell Curve]]'' argued that social inequality in the United States could largely be explained as a result of IQ differences between races and individuals rather than being their cause, and rekindled the public and scholarly debate with renewed force. During the debates following the book's publication, the [[American Anthropological Association]] and the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) published official statements regarding the issue, both highly skeptical of some of the book's claims, although the APA report called for more empirical research on the issue.

==History of the debate==
{{Main|History of the race and intelligence controversy}}
{{See also|Scientific racism}}
[[File:Alfred Binet.jpg|160px|thumb|[[Alfred Binet]] (1857–1911), inventor of the first intelligence test.]]

Claims of races having different intelligence were used to justify [[colonialism]], [[slavery]], [[racism]], [[social Darwinism]], and racial [[eugenic]]s. Racial thinkers such as [[Arthur de Gobineau]] relied crucially on the assumption that black people were innately inferior to whites in developing their ideologies of [[white supremacy]]. Even enlightenment thinkers such as [[Thomas Jefferson]], a slave owner, believed blacks to be innately inferior to whites in physique and intellect.{{sfn|Jackson|Weidman|2004|p=23}}

===Early IQ testing===
The first practical intelligence test was developed between 1905 and 1908 by [[Alfred Binet]] in France for school placement of children. Binet warned that results from his test should not be assumed to measure innate intelligence or used to label individuals permanently.{{sfn|Plotnik|Kouyoumdjian|2011}} Binet's test was translated into English and revised in 1916 by [[Lewis Terman]] (who introduced IQ scoring for the test results) and published under the name the [[Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales]]. As Terman's test was published, there was great concern in the United States about the abilities and skills of recent immigrants. Different immigrant nationalities were sometimes thought to belong to different races, such as [[Slavs]]. A different set of tests developed by [[Robert Yerkes]] were used to evaluate draftees for World War I, and researchers found that people from southern and eastern Europe scored lower than native-born Americans, that Americans from northern states had higher scores than Americans from southern states, and that Black Americans scored lower than white Americans.{{sfn|Jackson|Weidman|2004|page=116}} The results were widely publicized by a lobby of anti-immigration activists, including the New York patrician and conservationist [[Madison Grant]], who considered the [[nordic race]] to be superior, but under threat of immigration by inferior breeds. In his influential work ''A Study of American Intelligence'' psychologist [[Carl Brigham]] used the results of the Army tests to argue for a stricter immigration policy, limiting immigration to countries considered to belong to the "nordic race".{{sfn|Jackson|Weidman|2004|page=116, 309}}

In the 1920s, states like Virginia enacted [[eugenic]] laws, such as its [[Racial Integrity Act of 1924|1924 Racial Integrity Act]], which established the [[one-drop rule]] as law. On the other hand, many scientists reacted to eugenicist claims linking abilities and moral character to racial or genetic ancestry. They pointed to the contribution of environment to test results (such as speaking English as a second language).{{sfn|Pickren|Rutherford|2010|p=163}} By the mid-1930s, many United States psychologists adopted the view that environmental and cultural factors played a dominant role in IQ test results, among them Carl Brigham who repudiated his own previous arguments, on the grounds that he realized that the tests were not a measure of innate intelligence. Discussion of the issue in the United States also influenced [[Germans|German]] [[Nazi]] claims of the "nordics" being a "[[master race]]", influenced by Grant's writings.{{sfn|Spiro|2009}} As the American public sentiment shifted against the Germans, claims of racial differences in intelligence increasingly came to be regarded as problematic.&lt;ref name="Ludy 2006"&gt;{{harvnb|Ludy|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologists such as [[Franz Boas]], and [[Ruth Benedict]] and [[Gene Weltfish]], did much to demonstrate the unscientific status of many of the claims about racial hierarchies of intelligence.{{sfn|Jackson|Weidman|2004|pages=130–32}} Nonetheless a powerful eugenics and segregation lobby funded largely by textile-magnate [[Wickliffe Draper]], continued to publicize studies using intelligence studies as an argument for eugenics, segregation, and anti-immigration legislation.{{sfn|Tucker|2002}}

===The Jensenism debates===
{{See also|Jensenism}}
As the de-segregation of the American South was begun in the 1950s the debate about black intelligence resurfaced. [[Audrey Shuey]], funded by Draper's [[Pioneer fund|Pioneer Fund]], published a new analysis of Yerkes' tests, concluding that blacks really were of inferior intellect to whites. This study was used by segregationists as an argument that it was to the advantage of black children to be educated separately from the superior white children.{{sfn|Jackson|2005}} In the 1960s, the debate was further revived when [[William Shockley]] publicly defended the argument that Black children were innately unable to learn as well as White children.{{sfn|Shurkin|2006}} [[Arthur Jensen]] stimulated scholarly discussion of the issue with his ''[[Harvard Educational Review]]'' article, "[[How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?]]"{{sfn|Jensen|1969|p=82}}{{sfn|Tucker|2002}}{{sfn|Wooldridge|1995}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Panofsky |first1=Aaron |title=Misbehaving Science. Controversy and the Development of Behavior Genetics |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-05831-3 |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen's article questioned remedial education for African-American children; he suggested their poor educational performance reflected an underlying genetic cause rather than lack of stimulation at home.{{sfn|Alland|2002|pages=79–80}} Jensen continued to publish on the issue until his death in 2012.

===The ''Bell Curve'' debate===
Another revival of public debate followed the appearance of ''[[The Bell Curve]]'' (1994), a book by [[Richard Herrnstein]] and [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]], who strongly emphasized the societal effects of low IQ (focusing in most chapters strictly on the non-Hispanic white population of the United States).{{sfn|Herrnstein|Murray|1994}} In 1994, a group of 52 researchers (mostly psychologists) signed an editorial statement "[[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]]" in response to the book. ''The Bell Curve'' also led to a 1995 report from the [[American Psychological Association]], "[[Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns]]", acknowledging a difference between mean IQ scores of whites and blacks as well as the absence of any adequate explanation of it, either environmental or genetic. ''The Bell Curve'' prompted the publication of several multiple-author books responding from a variety of points of view.&lt;ref name="Mackintosh 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Mackintosh|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maltby, Day &amp; Macaskill 2007"/&gt; They include ''[[The Bell Curve Debate]]'' (1995), ''[[Inequality by Design: Cracking the Bell Curve Myth]]'' (1996) and a second edition of ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' (1996) by [[Stephen Jay Gould]].&lt;ref name="Maltby, Day &amp; Macaskill 2007"/&gt; Jensen's last book-length publication, ''[[The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability]]'' was published a few years later in 1998.

The review article "Thirty Years of Research on Race Differences in Cognitive Ability" by [[J. Philippe Rushton|Rushton]] and Jensen was published in 2005.{{sfn|Rushton|Jensen|2005}} The article was followed by a series of responses, some in support, some critical.&lt;ref name="Ludy 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rouvroy|2008|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Nisbett]], another psychologist who had also commented at the time, later included an amplified version of his critique as part of the book ''Intelligence and How to Get It: Why Schools and Cultures Count'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nisbett|2009|pp=209–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rushton and Jensen in 2010 made a point-by-point reply to this thereafter.&lt;ref name="Rushton &amp; Jensen 2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Rushton|Jensen|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive review article on the issue was published in the journal ''American Psychologist'' in 2012.{{sfn|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012}}

Some of the authors proposing genetic explanations for group differences have received funding from the [[Pioneer Fund]], which was headed by Rushton until his death in 2012.{{sfn|Tucker|2002}}&lt;ref name="Maltby, Day &amp; Macaskill 2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Maltby|Day|Macaskill|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Graves|2002a}}{{sfn|Graves|2002b}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossman|Kaufman|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] lists the Pioneer Fund as a [[hate group]], citing the fund's history, its funding of race and intelligence research, and its connections with [[racist]] individuals.{{sfn|Berlet|2003}} Other researchers have criticized the Pioneer Fund for promoting [[scientific racism]], [[eugenics]] and [[white supremacy]].{{sfn|Tucker|2002}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pioneerfund.org/Board.html Pioneer Fund Board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525150639/http://www.pioneerfund.org/Board.html |date=2011-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Falk|2008|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wroe|2008|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Validity of race and IQ==

===Intelligence, IQ, ''g'' and IQ tests===
{{Main|Intelligence quotient|Intelligence}}
The concept of intelligence and the degree to which intelligence is measurable is a matter of debate. While there is some consensus about how to define intelligence, it is not universally accepted that it is  something that can be unequivocally measured by a single figure.&lt;ref name="Schacter, Gilbert &amp; Wegner 2007, pp 350-1"&gt;{{harvnb|Schacter|Gilbert|Wegner|2007|pp=350–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recurring criticism is that different societies value and promote different kinds of skills and that the concept of intelligence is therefore culturally variable and cannot be measured by the same criteria in different societies.&lt;ref name="Schacter, Gilbert &amp; Wegner 2007, pp 350-1"/&gt; Consequently, some critics argue that proposed relationships to other variables are necessarily tentative.&lt;ref name="Sternberg, Grigorenko &amp; Kidd 2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Sternberg|Grigorenko|Kidd|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to the study of racial differences in IQ test scores it becomes a crucial question what exactly it is that IQ tests measure. Arthur Jensen was a proponent of the view that there is a correlation between scores on all the known types of IQ tests and that this correlation points to an underlying factor of [[general intelligence]], or ''g''. In most conceptions of ''g'' it is considered to be fairly fixed in a given individual and unresponsive to training or other environmental influences. In this view test score differences, especially in those tasks considered to be particularly "g-loaded" reflect the test takers innate capability.
Other psychometricians argue that, while there may or may not be a general intelligence factor, performance on tests rely crucially on knowledge acquired through prior exposure to the types of tasks that such tests contain. This view would mean that tests cannot be expected to reflect only the innate abilities of a given individual, because the expression of potential will always be mediated by experience and cognitive habits. It also means that comparison of test scores from persons with widely different life experiences and cognitive habits is not an expression of their relative innate potentials.{{sfn|Mackintosh|2011|p=359}}

===Race===
{{Main|Race (classification of humans)|Race and genetics}}
The majority of anthropologists today consider race to be a sociopolitical phenomenon rather than a biological one,{{sfn|Daley|Onwuegbuzie|2011|p=294}} a view supported by considerable genetics research.{{sfn|Smay|Armelagos|2000}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| journal = Nature Genetics |date=2004 | volume = 36 | pages = 43–47 |author1=Rotimi, Charles N. | title = Are medical and nonmedical uses of large-scale genomic markers conflating genetics and 'race'? | url = http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v36/n11s/full/ng1439.html | doi=10.1038/ng1439 |quote="Two facts are relevant: (i) as a result of different evolutionary forces, including natural selection, there are geographical patterns of genetic variations that correspond, for the most part, to continental origin; and (ii) observed patterns of geographical differences in genetic information do not correspond to our notion of social identities, including 'race' and 'ethnicity" | pmid=15508002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current mainstream view in the social sciences and biology is that race is a social construction based on folk ideologies that construct groups based on social disparities and superficial physical characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaefer|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvp|Sternberg|Grigorenko|Kidd|2005}} state, "Race is a socially constructed concept, not a biological one. It derives from people's desire to classify."&lt;ref name="Sternberg, Grigorenko &amp; Kidd 2005"/&gt; The concept of human "races" as natural and separate divisions within the human species has also been rejected by the [[American Anthropological Association]]. The official position of the AAA, adopted in 1998, is that advances in scientific knowledge have made it "clear that human populations are not unambiguous, clearly demarcated, biologically distinct groups" and that "any attempt to establish lines of division among biological populations [is] both arbitrary and subjective."&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{harvnb|AAA|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; However within population genetics there is ongoing debate about whether the social category of "race" can and should be used as a proxy for individual genetic ancestry. With current methods of genetic analysis it is possible to determine the composition of genetic ancestry of an individual with significant precision. This is because different genes occur with different frequencies in different geographically defined populations, and by correlating a large amount of genes through [[cluster analysis]] it is probable to determine with high likelihood the geographic origins of an individual through DNA. This suggests to some that the classical socially defined genetic categories really have a biological basis, in the sense that racial categorization is a visual estimate of a person's continental ancestry based on their phenotype—which correlates with genotypical ancestry as determined by DNA tests.

Race in studies of human intelligence is almost always determined using self-reports, rather than based on analyses of the genetic characteristics of the tested individuals. According to psychologist David Rowe, self-report is the preferred method for racial classification in studies of racial differences because classification based on genetic markers alone ignore the "cultural, behavioral, sociological, psychological, and epidemiological variables" that distinguish racial groups.&lt;ref name="Rowe 2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Rowe|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt and Carlson write that "Nevertheless, self-identification is a surprisingly reliable guide to genetic composition. {{harvp|Tang et al.|2005}} applied mathematical clustering techniques to sort genomic markers for over 3,600 people in the United States and Taiwan into four groups. There was almost perfect agreement between cluster assignment and individuals' self-reports of racial/ethnic identification as white, black, East Asian, or Latino."&lt;ref name="Hunt &amp; Carlson 2007"/&gt; Sternberg and Grigorenko disagree with Hunt and Carlson's interpretation of Tang, "Tang et al.'s point was that ancient geographic ancestry rather than current residence is associated with self-identification and not that such self-identification provides evidence for the existence of biological race."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sternberg|Grigorenko|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist [[C. Loring Brace]]&lt;ref name="Brace 2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Brace|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and geneticist [[Joseph L. Graves|Joseph Graves]] disagree with the idea that cluster analysis and the correlation between self-reported race and genetic ancestry support biological race.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Graves|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They argue that while it is possible to find biological and genetic variation corresponding roughly to the groupings normally defined as races, this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations. The cluster structure of the genetic data is dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clusters would be different. {{harvnb|Kaplan|2011}} therefore concludes that, while differences in particular allele frequencies can be used to identify populations that loosely correspond to the racial categories common in Western social discourse, the differences are of no more biological significance than the differences found between any human populations (e.g., the Spanish and Portuguese).

[[Earl B. Hunt]] agrees that racial categories are defined by social conventions, though he points out that they also correlate with clusters of both genetic traits and cultural traits. Hunt explains that, due to this, racial IQ differences are caused by these variables that correlate with race, and race itself is rarely a causal variable. Researchers who study racial disparities in test scores are studying the relationship between the scores and the many race-related factors which could potentially affect performance. These factors include health, wealth, biological differences, and education.&lt;ref name="Hunt 2010, pp 408–10"&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|2010|pp=408–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Group differences==
The study of human intelligence is one of the most controversial topics in psychology. It remains unclear whether group differences in intelligence test scores are caused by heritable factors or by "other correlated demographic variables such as [[socioeconomic]] status, [[Education|education level]], and motivation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hampshire|Highfield|Parkin|Owen|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Hunt and Carlson outlined four contemporary positions on differences in IQ based on race or ethnicity. The first is that these reflect real differences in average group intelligence, which is caused by a combination of environmental factors and heritable differences in brain function. A second position is that differences in average cognitive ability between races are caused entirely by social and/or environmental factors. A third position holds that differences in average cognitive ability between races do not exist, and that the differences in average test scores are the result of inappropriate use of the tests themselves. Finally, a fourth position is that either or both of the concepts of [[race (classification of humans)|race]] and [[general intelligence factor|general intelligence]] are poorly constructed and therefore any comparisons between races are meaningless.&lt;ref name="Hunt &amp; Carlson 2007"/&gt;

===United States test scores===
{{main|Achievement gap in the United States}}
In the United States, individuals identifying themselves as Asian tend to have higher average IQ scores than do Caucasians, who, in turn, have higher average IQs than African Americans. Nevertheless, greater variation in IQ scores exists within each ethnic group than between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yDDqLBBk7BcC |title=Encyclopedia of Diversity in Education |date=2012 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=9781412981521 |pages=1209 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvp|Rushton|Jensen|2005}} wrote that, in the [[United States]], self-identified blacks and whites have been the subjects of the greatest number of studies. They stated that the black-white IQ difference is about 15 to 18 points or 1 to 1.1 [[standard deviation]]s (SDs), which implies that between 11 and 16 percent of the black population have an IQ above 100 (the general population median). According to Arthur Jensen and J. Philippe Rushton the black-white IQ difference is largest on those components of IQ tests that are claimed best to represent the [[general intelligence factor]] ''g''.&lt;ref name="Rushton &amp; Jensen 2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Rushton|Jensen|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1996 APA report "[[Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns]]" and the 1994 editorial statement "[[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]]" gave more or less similar estimates.&lt;ref name="Neisser et al. 1996"&gt;{{harvnb|Neisser|Boodoo|Bouchard|Boykin|1996}} "The differential between the mean intelligence test scores of Blacks and Whites (about one standard deviation, although it may be diminishing) does not result from any obvious biases in test construction and administration, nor does it simply reflect differences in socio-economic status. Explanations based on factors of caste and culture may be appropriate, but so far have little direct empirical support. There is certainly no such support for a genetic interpretation. At present, no one knows what causes this differential."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gottfredson|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvp|Roth et al.|2001}}, in a review of the results of a total of 6,246,729 participants on other tests of cognitive ability or aptitude, found a difference in mean IQ scores between blacks and whites of 1.1 SD. Consistent results were found for college and university application tests such as the [[Scholastic Aptitude Test]] (N = 2.4 million) and [[Graduate Record Examination]] (N = 2.3 million), as well as for tests of job applicants in corporate sections (N = 0.5 million) and in the military (N = 0.4 million).&lt;ref name="Roth et al. 2001"&gt;{{harvnb|Roth et al.|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[East Asia]]ns have tended to score relatively higher on visuospatial subtests with lower scores in verbal subtests while [[Ashkenazi Jewish intelligence|Ashkenazi Jews score higher in verbal subtests]] with lower scores in visuospatial subtests. The few [[Amerindian]] populations who have been systematically tested, including Arctic Natives, tend to score worse on average than white populations but better on average than black populations.&lt;ref name="Roth et al. 2001"/&gt;

The racial groups studied in the United States and Europe are not necessarily [[sampling (statistics)|representative samples]] for populations in other parts of the world. Cultural differences may also factor in IQ test performance and outcomes. Therefore, results in the United States and Europe do not necessarily correlate to results in other populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Niu|Brass|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global variation of IQ scores===
{{further|Nations and intelligence}}
A number of studies have compared average IQ scores between the world's nations, finding patterns of difference between continental populations similar to those associated with race. [[Richard Lynn]] and [[Tatu Vanhanen]] have argued that populations in the third world, particularly populations in Africa, tend to have limited intelligence because of their genetic composition and that, consequently, education cannot be effective in creating social and economic development in third world countries.{{sfn|Hunt|2010|p=437-439}} Lynn and Vanhanen's studies have been severely criticized for relying on low quality data and for choosing sources in ways that seem to be biased severely towards underestimating the average IQ potential of developing nations, particularly in Africa.{{sfn|Hunt|2010|pages=426–445}}{{sfn|Wicherts|Dolan|van der Maas|2009|page=10}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | journal = Contemporary Psychology: APA Review of Books | date = August 2004 | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 389–396 | author1 = Barnett, Susan M. | author2 = Williams, Wendy | lastauthoramp = yes | title = National Intelligence and the Emperor's New Clothes | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-17780-001 | doi = 10.1037/004367 | quote = "we see an edifice built on layer upon layer of arbitrary assumptions and selective data manipulation. The data on which the entire book is based are of questionable validity and are used in ways that cannot be justified." }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless there is a general consensus that the average IQ in developing countries is lower than in developed countries, but subsequent research has favored environmental explanations for this fact, such as lack of basic infrastructure related to health and education.

In the 2002 book ''[[IQ and the Wealth of Nations]]'', and ''[[IQ and Global Inequality]]'' in 2006, Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen created estimates of average IQs for 113 nations. They estimated IQs of 79 other nations based on neighboring nations or via other means. They saw a consistent correlation between national development and national IQ averages. They found the highest national IQs among [[Western country|Western]] and [[East Asia]]n developed nations and the lowest national IQs in the world's least developed nations among the indigenous peoples in the regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Global Bell Curve |last=Lynn |first=Richard |publisher=Washington Summit Publishers |year=2008 |pages=294–297}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a meta-analysis of studies of IQ estimates in Sub-Saharan Africa, {{harvtxt|Wicherts|Dolan|van der Maas|2009|page=10}} concluded that Lynn and Vanhanen had relied on unsystematic methodology by failing to publish their criteria for including or excluding studies. They found that Lynn and Vanhanen's exclusion of studies had depressed their IQ estimate for sub-Saharan Africa, and that including studies excluded in "IQ and Global Inequality" resulted in average IQ of 82 for sub-Saharan Africa, lower than the average in Western countries, but higher than Lynn and Vanhanen's estimate of 67.  Wicherts at al. conclude that this difference is likely due to sub-Saharan Africa having limited access to modern advances in education, nutrition and health care.{{sfn|Wicherts|Dolan|van der Maas|2009}}

A 2010 systematic review by the same research team, along with [[Jerry S. Carlson]], found that compared to American norms, the average IQ of sub-Saharan Africans was about 80. The same review concluded that the [[Flynn effect]] had not yet taken hold in sub-Saharan Africa.{{sfn|Wicherts|Dolan|Carlson|van der Maas|2010}}

A 2007 meta-analysis by Rindermann found many of the same groupings and correlations found by Lynn and Vanhanen, with the lowest scores in sub-Saharan Africa, and a correlation of .60 between cognitive skill and GDP per capita. {{harvtxt|Hunt|2010|pp=437–439}} considers Rindermann's analysis to be much more reliable than Lynn and Vanhanen's. By measuring the relationship between educational data and social wellbeing over time, this study also performed a causal analysis, finding that when nations invest in education this leads to increased well-being later on.{{sfn|Hunt|2010|p=440-443}} Kamin (2006) has also criticized Lynn and Vanhanen's work on the IQs of sub-Saharan Africans.{{sfn|Kamin|2006}}

Wicherts, Borsboom &amp; Dolan (2010) argue that studies reporting support for evolutionary theories of intelligence based on national IQ data suffer from multiple fatal methodological flaws. For example, they state that such studies "...assume that the Flynn Effect is either nonexistent or invariant with respect to different regions of the world, that there have been no migrations and climatic changes over the course of evolution, and that there have been no trends over the last century in indicators of reproductive strategies (e.g., declines in fertility and infant mortality)." They also showed that a strong degree of confounding exists between national IQs and current national development status.{{sfn|Wicherts|Borsboom|Dolan|2010}}

Similarly, Pesta &amp; Poznanski (2014) showed that the average temperature of a given U.S. state is strongly associated with that state's average IQ and other well-being variables, despite the fact that evolution has not had enough time to operate on non-Native American residents of the United States. They also noted that this association persisted even after controlling for race, and concluded that "Evolution is therefore not necessary for temperature and IQ/well-being to co-vary meaningfully across geographic space."{{sfn|Pesta|Poznanski|2014}}

===Flynn effect and the closing gap===
{{Main|Flynn effect}}
For the past century raw scores on IQ tests have been rising; this score increase is known as the "Flynn effect," named after [[James Flynn (academic)|James R. Flynn]]. In the United States, the increase was continuous and approximately linear from the earliest years of testing to about 1998 when the gains stopped and some tests even showed decreasing test scores. For example, in the United States the average scores of blacks on some IQ tests in 1995 were the same as the scores of whites in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackintosh|1998|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one pair of academics phrased it, "the typical African American today probably has a slightly higher IQ than the grandparents of today's average white American."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Swain | first = Carol | title = Contemporary voices of white nationalism in America | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0521016933 | page = 70}} Note: this quote is from the authors' introductory essay, not from the interviews.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flynn has argued that given that these changes take place between one generation and the next it is highly unlikely that genetic factors could account for the increasing scores, which must then be caused by environmental factors. The Flynn Effect has often been used as an argument that the racial gap in IQ test scores must be environmental too, but this is not generally agreed – others have asserted that the two may have entirely different causes. A meta-analysis by Te Nijenhuis and [[Henk van der Flier|van der Flier]] (2013) concluded that the Flynn effect and group differences in intelligence were likely to have different causes. They stated that the Flynn effect is caused primarily by environmental factors and that it's unlikely these same environmental factors play an important role in explaining group differences in IQ.&lt;ref name="Nijenhuis"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=te Nijenhuis|first1=Jan |last2=van der Flier |first2=Henk | author-link2 = Henk van der Flier | title=Is the Flynn effect on g?: A meta-analysis|journal=Intelligence|volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=802–807 |year=2013|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289613000226|ref=harv |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2013.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of the Flynn effect in the debate over the causes for the IQ gap lies in demonstrating that environmental factors may cause changes in test scores on the scale of 1 SD. This had previously been doubted.

A separate phenomenon from the Flynn effect has been the discovery that the IQ gap has been gradually closing over the last decades of the 20th century, as black test-takers increased their average scores relative to white test-takers. For instance, Vincent reported in 1991 that the black-white IQ gap was decreasing among children, but that it was remaining constant among adults.{{sfn|Vincent|1991}} Similarly, a 2006 study by Dickens and Flynn estimated that the difference between mean scores of blacks and whites closed by about 5 or 6 IQ points between 1972 and 2002,{{sfn|Dickens|Flynn|2006}} a reduction of about one-third. In the same period, the educational achievement disparity also diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Neisser, Ulric (Ed). 1998. The rising curve: Long-term gains in IQ and related measures. Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was challenged by Rushton &amp; Jensen who claim the difference remains stable.{{sfn|Rushton|Jensen|2006}} In a 2006 study, Murray agreed with Dickens and Flynn that there has been a narrowing of the difference; "Dickens' and Flynn's estimate of 3–6 IQ points from a base of about 16–18 points is a useful, though provisional, starting point". But he argued that this has stalled and that there has been no further narrowing for people born after the late 1970s.{{sfn|Murray|2006}} A subsequent study by Murray, based on the [[Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities]], estimated that the black-white IQ difference decreased by about one-half of one standard deviation from those born in the 1920s to those born in the second half of the 1960s and early 1970s.{{sfn|Murray|2007}} Recent reviews by Flynn and Dickens (2006), Mackintosh (2011), and Nisbett ''et al.'' 2012 accept the gradual closing of the gap as a fact. In his review of the historical trends, {{harvtxt|Hunt|2010|page=411}} states: "There is some variety in the results, but not a great deal. The African American means are about 1 standard deviation unit (15 points on the IQ scale) below the White means, and the Hispanic means fall in between."

Some studies reviewed by {{harvtxt|Hunt|2010|page=418}} found that rise in the average achievement of African Americans was caused by a reduction in the number of African American students in the lowest range of scores without a corresponding increase in the number of students in the highest ranges. A 2012 review of the literature found that the IQ gap had diminished by 0.33 standard deviations since first reported.{{sfn|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012}}{{sfn|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012b}}

A 2013 analysis of the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] found that from 1971 to 2008, the size of the black–white IQ gap in the United States decreased from 16.33 to 9.94 IQ points. It has also concluded however that, while IQ means are continuing to rise in all ethnic groups, this growth is occurring more slowly among 17-year-old students than among younger students and the black-white IQ gap is no longer narrowing. As of 2008, a study published in 2013 by Heiner Rindermann, Stefan Pinchelmann, and James Thompson have estimated the IQ means of 17-year-old black, white, and Hispanic students to range respectively from 90.45–94.15, 102.29–104.57 and 92.30–95.90 points. They explain that the gap may persist due to the [[crack epidemic]], the degradation of [[African-American family structure]], the rise of fraud in the educational system (especially with respect to ''[[No Child Left Behind]]''), the decrease in unskilled real wages and employment among African-Americans due to [[globalization]] and [[minimum wage]] increases, differences in parental practices (such as breastfeeding or reading to children), and "environmental conditions shaped by [African-Americans] themselves." To resolve this, they ultimately recommend the reestablishment of "meritoric principles" and "blindly graded objective central exams," as opposed to "[[affirmative action|ethnically based policies]]," in education.{{sfn|Rindermann|Thompson|2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rindermann|first1=Heiner|last2=Pinchelmann|first2=Stefan|title=Future Cognitive Ability: US IQ Prediction until 2060 Based on NAEP|journal=Pone|date=13 October 2015|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0138412|volume=10|page=e0138412|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1038412R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental influences on group differences in IQ==
The following environmental factors are some of those suggested as explaining a portion of the differences in average IQ between races. These factors are not mutually exclusive with one another, and some may, in fact, contribute directly to others. Furthermore, the relationship between genetics and environmental factors may be complicated. For example, the differences in socioeconomic environment for a child may be due to differences in genetic IQ for the parents, and the differences in average brain size between races could be the result of nutritional factors.{{sfn|Neisser|Boodoo|Bouchard|Boykin|1996}} All recent reviews agree that some environmental factors that are unequally distributed between racial groups have been shown to affect intelligence in ways that could contribute to the test score gap. However, currently, the question is whether these factors can account for the entire gap between white and black test scores, or only part of it. One group of scholars, including [[Richard E. Nisbett]], [[James Flynn (academic)|James R. Flynn]], Joshua Aronson, Diane Halpern, William Dickens, Eric Turkheimer (2012) have argued that the environmental factors so far demonstrated are sufficient to account for the entire gap, [[Nicholas Mackintosh]] (2011) considers this a reasonable argument, but argues that probably it is impossible to ever know for sure; another group including [[Earl B. Hunt]] (2010), [[Arthur Jensen]],{{sfn|Rushton|Jensen|2005}} [[J. Philippe Rushton]] and [[Richard Lynn]] have argued that this is impossible. Jensen and Rushton consider that it may account for as little as 20% of the gap. Meanwhile, while Hunt considers this a vast overstatement, he nonetheless considers it likely that some portion of the gap will eventually be shown to be caused by genetic factors.

===Test bias===
A number of studies have reached the conclusion that IQ tests may be biased against certain groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cronshaw et al.|2006|p=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Verney et al.|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borsboom|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shuttleworth-Edwards et al.|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The validity and reliability of IQ scores obtained from outside the United States and Europe have been questioned, in part because of the inherent difficulty of comparing IQ scores between cultures.&lt;ref name="Richardson 2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Richardson|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunt &amp; Wittmann 2008"&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|Wittmann|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several researchers have argued that cultural differences limit the appropriateness of standard IQ tests in non-industrialized communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Irvine|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Irvine|Berry|1988}} a collection of articles by several authors discussing the limits of assessment by intelligence tests in different communities in the world. In particular, {{harvp|Reuning|1988}} describes the difficulties in devising and administering tests for Kalahari bushmen.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a 1996 report by the [[American Psychological Association]] states that controlled studies show that differences in mean IQ scores were not substantially due to bias in the content or administration of the IQ tests. Furthermore, the tests are equally valid predictors of future achievement for black and white Americans.&lt;ref name="Neisser et al. 1996"/&gt; This view is reinforced by [[Nicholas Mackintosh]] in his 1998 book ''IQ and Human Intelligence'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackintosh|1998|p=174}}: "Despite widespread belief to the contrary, however, there is ample evidence, both in Britain and the USA, that IQ tests predict educational attainment just about as well in ethnic minorities as in the white majority."&lt;/ref&gt; and by a 1999 literature review by {{harvp|Brown|Reynolds|Whitaker|1999}}. Today, test bias in the sense that some test items systematically give White test takers an unfair advantage because of the way the test has been elaborated is no longer considered a likely cause of the test score gap.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} However reviews by Hunt (2011) and Mackintosh (2011) do admit the possibility that IQ tests measure a cognitive skill that Blacks have less chance to develop, and that there is in this sense a bias in society that causes one group to perform under their true potential on the tests. But both scholars maintain that there is no evidence that current tests are systemically biased against black test takers.

===Stereotype threat and minority status===
{{Main|Stereotype threat}}
[[Stereotype threat]] is the fear that one's behavior will confirm an existing [[stereotype]] of a group with which one identifies or by which one is defined; this fear may in turn lead to an impairment of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aronson|Wilson|Akert| 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testing situations that highlight the fact that intelligence is being measured tend to lower the scores of individuals from racial-ethnic groups who already score lower on average or are expected to score lower. Stereotype threat conditions cause larger than expected IQ differences among groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=Claude M.|title=A threat in the air: How stereotypes shape intellectual identity and performance|journal=American Psychologist|volume=52|issue=6|year=1997|pages=613–629|issn=0003-066X|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.52.6.613|pmid=9174398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychometrician [[Nicholas Mackintosh]] considers that there is little doubt that the effects of stereotype threat contribute to the IQ gap between blacks and whites.{{sfn|Mackintosh|2011|p=348}}

A large number of studies have shown that systemically disadvantaged minorities, such as the African American minority of the United States generally perform worse in the educational system and in intelligence tests than the majority groups or less disadvantaged minorities such as immigrant or "voluntary" minorities.&lt;ref name="Neisser et al. 1996"/&gt; The explanation of these findings may be that children of caste-like minorities, due to the systemic limitations of their prospects of social advancement, do not have "[[effort optimism]]", i.e. they do not have the confidence that acquiring the skills valued by majority society, such as those skills measured by IQ tests, is worthwhile. They may even deliberately reject certain behaviors that are seen as "[[acting white]]."{{sfn|Neisser|Boodoo|Bouchard|Boykin|1996}}{{sfn|Ogbu|1978}}{{sfn|Ogbu|1994}}

Research published in 1997 indicates that part of the black-white gap in cognitive ability test scores is due to racial differences in test motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chan |first=D. |last2=Schmitt |first2=N. |last3=DeShon |first3=R.

Attempts to replicate studies evincing significant effects of stereotype threat however have not yielded the same results. In 2004 Sackett et al. found that eliminating stereotype threat does not eliminate the racial test performance gap, and in 2005 Tyson et al. found African Americans to have motivation similar to or even better than that of white Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=It's Not "a Black Thing": Understanding the Burden of Acting White and Other Dilemmas of High Achievement|authors=Karolyn Tyson, William Darity Jr., and Domini R.

===Socioeconomic environment===
Different aspects of the socioeconomic environment in which children are raised have been shown to correlate with part of the IQ gap, but they do not account for the entire gap.{{sfn|Hunt|2010|page=428}} According to a 2006 review, these factors account for slightly less than half of one standard deviation of the gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Magnuson|first1=Katherine A.|last2=Duncan|first2=Greg J.|title=The role of family socioeconomic resources in the black–white test score gap among young children|journal=[[Developmental Review]]|date=December 2006|volume=26|issue=4|pages=365–399|doi=10.1016/j.dr.2006.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the difference between mean test scores of blacks and whites is not eliminated when individuals and groups are matched on socioeconomic status (SES), suggesting that the relationship between IQ and SES is not simply one in which SES determines IQ. Rather it may be the case that differences in intelligence, particularly parental intelligence, may also cause differences in SES, making separating the two factors difficult.&lt;ref name="Neisser et al. 1996"/&gt; {{harvtxt|Hunt|2010|page=428}} summarises data {{clarify|date = December 2015|reason = which research?}} showing that, jointly, SES and parental IQ account for the full gap (in populations of young children, after controlling parental IQ and parental SES, the gap is not statistically different from zero). He argues the SES-linked components reflect parental occupation status, mother's verbal comprehension score and parent-child interaction quality. Hunt also reviews data showing that the correlation between home environment and IQ becomes weaker with age.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}  Hart and Risley argue that in welfare, working-class, and professional families, children hear a large disparity in the amount of language (between 13 million and 45 million words) in the age range of 0–3, and that by age 9 these differences led to large differences in child outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hart|first1=Betty|last2=Risley|first2=Todd|title=Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children|publisher=Brookes Publishing, Baltimore, Maryland, USA|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research has focussed on different causes of variation within low SES and high SES groups.&lt;ref name="Scarr-Salapatek1971"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scarr-Salapatek | first1 = S. | year = 1971 | title = Race, social class, and IQ. | url = | journal = Science | volume = 174 | issue = | pages = 1285–95 | doi=10.1126/science.174.4016.1285| bibcode = 1971Sci...174.1285S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scarr-Salapatek1974"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scarr-Salapatek | first1 = S. | year = 1974 | title = Some myths about heritability and IQ. | doi = 10.1038/251463b0 | journal = Nature | volume = 251 | issue = | pages = 463–464 | bibcode = 1974Natur.251..463S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rowe1994"&gt;D.

The same review also points out that adoption studies generally are biased towards including only high and high middle SES adoptive families, meaning that they will tend to overestimate average genetic effects.  They also note that studies of adoption from lower-class homes to middle-class homes have shown that such children experience a 12–18 pt gain in IQ relative to children who remain in low SES homes.{{sfn|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012}} A 2015 study found that environmental factors (namely, family income, maternal education, maternal verbal ability/knowledge, learning materials in the home, parenting factors (maternal sensitivity, maternal warmth and acceptance, and safe physical environment), child birth order, and child birth weight) accounted for the black-white gap in cognitive ability test scores.{{sfn|Cottrell|Newman|Roisman|2015}}

===Health and nutrition===

Environmental factors including [[lead]] exposure,{{clarify|date=March 2016}}&lt;ref name="Bellinger, Stiles &amp; Needleman 1992"/&gt; [[breast feeding]],&lt;ref name="Campbell et al. 2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell et al.|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[nutrition]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ivanovic et al.|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saloojee| Pettifor|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; can significantly affect cognitive development and functioning. For example, [[Cretinism|iodine deficiency causes a fall]], on average, of 12 IQ points.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Qian et al.|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=James |last=Feyrer |first2=Dimitra |last2=Politi |first3=David N. |last3=Weil |title=The Cognitive Effects of Micronutrient Deficiency: Evidence from Salt Iodization in the United States |year=2017 |journal=Journal of the European Economic Association |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=355–387 |doi=10.1093/jeea/jvw002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such impairments may sometimes be permanent, sometimes be partially or wholly compensated for by later growth. The first two years of life is the critical time for malnutrition, the consequences of which are often irreversible and include poor cognitive development, educability, and future economic productivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelancet.com/series/maternal-and-child-undernutrition The Lancet Series on Maternal and Child Undernutrition], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Which paper?

At the same time white mothers are twice as likely to breastfeed their infants, and breastfeeding is highly correlated with IQ for low birthweight infants. In this way a wide number of health related factors that influence IQ are unequally distributed between the two groups.{{sfn|Mackintosh|2011|pages=343–44}} Reichman estimates that no more than 3 to 4% of the black-white IQ gap can be explained by black-white disparities in low birth weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reichman|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Copenhagen consensus]] in 2004 stated that lack of both iodine and iron has been implicated in impaired brain development, and this can affect enormous numbers of people: it is estimated that one-third of the total global population are affected by [[iodine deficiency]]. In developing countries, it is estimated that 40% of children aged four and under suffer from [[anaemia]] because of insufficient iron in their diets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Behrman|Alderman|Hoddinott|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars have found that simply the standard of nutrition has a significant effect on population intelligence, and that the Flynn effect may be caused by increasing nutrition standards across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colom | first1 = R. | last2 = Lluis-Font | first2 = J.

Some recent research has argued that the retardation caused in brain development by [[infectious disease]]s, many of which are more prevalent in non-White populations, may be an important factor in explaining the differences in IQ between different regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eppig|Fincher|Thornhill|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings of this research, showing the correlation between IQ, race and infectious diseases was also shown to apply to the IQ gap in the US, suggesting that this may be an important environmental factor.&lt;ref name="Eppig 2011"&gt;{{harvnb|Eppig|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 meta-analysis by the World Health Organization found that, after controlling for maternal IQ, breastfeeding was associated with IQ gains of 2.19 points. The authors suggest that this relationship is causal but state that the practical significance of this gain is debatable; however, they highlight one study suggesting an association between breastfeeding and academic performance in Brazil, where "breastfeeding duration does not present marked variability by socioeconomic position."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Long-term effects of breastfeeding – a systemic review|authors=Bernardo L.

They suggest that "much of the beneficial long-term effects typically attributed to breastfeeding, per say, may primarily be due to selection pressures into infant feeding practices along key demographic characteristics such as race and socioeconomic status."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cynthia G.

===Education===
Several studies have proposed that a large part of the gap can be attributed to differences in quality of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Manly et al.|2002}} and {{harvnb|Manly et al.|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Racial discrimination]] in education has been proposed as one possible cause of differences in educational quality between races.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mickelson|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a paper by Hala Elhoweris, Kagendo Mutua, Negmeldin Alsheikh and Pauline Holloway, teachers' referral decisions for students to participate in [[gifted education|gifted and talented]] educational programs were influenced in part by the students' ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elhoweris et al.|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Abecedarian Early Intervention Project]], an intensive early childhood education project, was also able to bring about an average IQ gain of 4.4 points at age 21 in the black children who participated in it compared to controls.&lt;ref name="Campbell et al. 2002"/&gt; [[Arthur Jensen]] agreed that the Abecedarian project demonstrates that education can have a significant effect on IQ, but also said that no educational program thus far has been able to reduce the black-white IQ gap by more than a third, and that differences in education are thus unlikely to be its only cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miele|2002|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rushton and Jensen argue that long-term follow-up of the [[Head Start Program]] found large immediate gains for blacks and whites but that these were quickly lost for the blacks although some remained for whites. They argue that also other more intensive and prolonged educational interventions have not produced lasting effects on IQ or scholastic performance.&lt;ref name="Rushton &amp; Jensen 2005"/&gt; Nisbett argues that they ignore studies such as {{harvp|Campbell|Ramey|1994}} which found that at the age 12, 87% of black infants exposed to an intervention had IQs in the normal range (above 85) compared to 56% of controls, and none of the intervention-exposed children were mildly retarded compared to 7% of controls. Other early intervention programs have shown IQ effects in the range of 4–5 points, which are sustained until at least age 8–15. Effects on academic achievement can also be substantial. Nisbett also argues that not only early age intervention can be effective, citing other successful intervention studies from infancy to college.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nisbett|2005|pp=303–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of studies by [[Joseph Fagan]] and Cynthia Holland measured the effect of prior exposure to the kind of cognitive tasks posed in IQ tests on test performance. Assuming that the IQ gap was the result of lower exposure to tasks using the cognitive functions usually found in IQ tests among African American test takes, they prepared a group of African Americans in this type of tasks before taking an IQ test. The researchers found that there was no subsequent difference in performance between the African-Americans and White test takers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fagan | first1 = Joseph F | last2 = Holland | first2 = Cynthia R | year = 2002 | title = Equal opportunity and racial differences in IQ | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 361–387 | doi = 10.1016/S0160-2896(02)00080-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fagan | first1 = J.F. | last2 = Holland | first2 = C.R. | year = 2007 | title = Racial equality in intelligence: Predictions from a theory of intelligence as processing | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 319–334 | doi=10.1016/j.intell.2006.08.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daley and Onwuegbuzie conclude that Fagan and Holland demonstrate that "differences in knowledge between Blacks and Whites for intelligence test items can be erased when equal opportunity is provided for exposure to the information to be tested".{{sfn|Daley|Onwuegbuzie|2011}} A similar argument is made by [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] who argues that IQ differences correlate well with differences in literacy suggesting that developing literacy skills through education causes an increase in IQ test performance.&lt;ref name="Marks, D.F. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marks | first1 = D.F. | year = 2010 | title = IQ variations across time, race, and nationality: An artifact of differences in literacy skills | url = | journal = Psychological Reports | volume = 106 | issue = 3| pages = 643–664 | doi=10.2466/pr0.106.3.643-664 | pmid=20712152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barry |first=Scott |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beautiful-minds/201008/the-flynn-effect-and-iq-disparities-among-races-ethnicities-and-nations- |title=The Flynn Effect and IQ Disparities Among Races, Ethnicities, and Nations: Are There Common Links? |publisher=Psychology Today |date=2010-08-23 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 study found that two variables — stereotype threat and the degree of educational attainment of children's fathers — partially explained the black-white gap in cognitive ability test scores, undermining the hereditarian view that they stemmed from immutable genetic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKay|first1=Patrick F.|last2=Doverspike|first2=Dennis|last3=Bowen‐Hilton|first3=Doreen|last4=McKay|first4=Quintonia D.|title=The Effects of Demographic Variables and Stereotype Threat on Black/White Differences in Cognitive Ability Test Performance|journal=Journal of Business and Psychology|date=2003|volume=18|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1023/A:1025062703113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research into the possible genetic influences on test score differences==
{{see also|Heritability of IQ}}
Ongoing research aims to understand the contribution of genes to differences in intelligence. Currently there is no non-circumstantial evidence that the test score gap has a genetic component,{{sfn|Mackintosh|2011|p=358}}{{sfn|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012}}{{sfn|Kaplan|2015}} although some researchers believe that the existing circumstantial evidence makes it plausible to believe that hard evidence for a genetic component will eventually appear.{{sfn|Hunt|2010|pages=436, 447}} Growing evidence indicates that environmental factors, not genetic ones, are more important in explaining the racial IQ gap.{{sfn|Nevid|2014|page=271}} Several lines of investigation have been followed in the attempt to ascertain whether there is a genetic component to the test score gap as well as its relative contribution to the magnitude of the gap.

===Genetics of race and intelligence===
{{main|Race and genetics}}
Geneticist [[Alan R. Templeton]] argues that the question about the possible genetic effects on the test score gap is muddled by the general focus on "race" rather than on populations defined by gene frequency or by geographical proximity, and by the general insistence on phrasing the question in terms of heritability.&lt;ref name="Templeton 2001"&gt;{{harvnb|Templeton|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Templeton points out that racial groups neither represent [[sub-species]] nor distinct [[lineage (evolution)|evolutionary lineages]], and that therefore there is no basis for making claims about the general intelligence of races.&lt;ref name="Templeton 2001"/&gt; From this point of view the search for possible genetic influences on the black-white test score gap is a priori flawed, because there is no genetic material shared by all  Africans or by all Europeans. {{harvp|Mackintosh|2011}} points out that by using genetic cluster analysis to correlate gene frequencies with continental populations it could  possibly be the case that African populations had a higher frequency of certain genetic variants that contribute to an average lower intelligence. Such a hypothetical situation could hold without all Africans carrying the same genes or belonging to a single Evolutionary lineage. According to Mackintosh, a biological basis for the gap thus cannot be ruled out on a priori grounds.

Intelligence is a [[polygenic trait]]. This means that intelligence is under the influence of several genes, possibly several thousand. The effect of most individual genetic variants on intelligence is thought to be very small, well below 1% of the variance in ''g''. Current studies using [[quantitative trait loci]] have yielded little success in the search for genes influencing intelligence. [[Robert Plomin]] is confident that QTLs responsible for the variation in IQ scores exist, but due to their small effect sizes, more powerful tools of analysis will be required to detect them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plomin|Kennedy|Craig|2005|p=513}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others assert that no useful answers can be reasonably expected from such research before an understanding of the relation between DNA and human phenotypes emerges.&lt;ref name="Cooper 2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several candidate genes have been proposed to have a relationship with intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zinkstok et al.|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dick et al.|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a review of candidate genes for intelligence published in {{harvp|Deary|Johnson|Houlihan|2009}} failed to find evidence of an association between these genes and general intelligence, stating "there is still almost no replicated evidence concerning the individual genes, which have variants that contribute to intelligence differences".&lt;ref name="Deary, Johnson &amp; Houlihan 2009"&gt;{{harvnb|Deary|Johnson|Houlihan|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, a review in the ''[[Journal of Black Psychology]]'' refuted eight major premises on which the hereditarian view regarding race and intelligence is based.&lt;ref name="Onwegbuzie &amp; Daley 2001"&gt;{{harvnb|Onwuegbuzie|Daley|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 literature review article by Sternberg, Grigorenko and Kidd stated that no gene has been shown to be linked to intelligence, "so attempts to provide a compelling genetic link of race to intelligence are not feasible at this time".{{sfn|Sternberg|Grigorenko|Kidd|2005|p=46}} {{harvtxt|Hunt|2010|page=447}} and {{harvtxt|Mackintosh|2011|page=344}} concurred, both scholars noting that while several environmental factors have been shown to influence the IQ gap, the evidence for a genetic influence has been circumstantial, and according to Mackintosh negligible. Mackintosh however suggests that it may never become possible to account satisfyingly for the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors. The 2012 review by {{harvp|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair| Dickens|2012}} concluded that "Almost no genetic polymorphisms have been discovered that are consistently associated with variation in IQ in the normal range". Hunt and several other researchers however maintain that genetic causes cannot be ruled out, and that new evidence may yet show a genetic contribution to the gap. Hunt concurs with Rushton and Jensen who considered the 100% environmental hypothesis to be impossible. Nonetheless, Nisbett and colleagues (2012) consider the entire IQ gap to be explained by the environmental factors that have thus far been demonstrated to influence it, and Mackintosh does not find this view to be unreasonable.{{sfn|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012}}

===Heritability within and between groups===
[[File:Heritability plants.jpeg|thumb| An environmental factor that varies between groups but not within groups can cause group differences in a trait that is otherwise 100 percent [[heritable]].]]

[[Twin studies]] of intelligence have reported high heritability values. However, these studies are based on questionable assumptions.{{sfn|Carson|Beckwith|2001}} When used in the context of human [[behavior genetics]], the term "heritability" is highly misleading, as it does not convey any information about the relative importance of genetic or environmental factors on the development of a given trait, nor does it convey the extent to which that trait is genetically determined.{{sfn|Moore|Shenk|2016}} Arguments in support of a genetic explanation of racial differences in IQ are sometimes fallacious. For instance, hereditarians have sometimes cited the failure of known environmental factors to account for such differences, or the high heritability of intelligence within races, as evidence that racial differences in IQ are genetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackenzie|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychometricians have found that intelligence is substantially heritable within populations, with 30–50% of variance in IQ scores in early childhood being attributable to genetic factors in analyzed US populations, increasing to 75–80% by late adolescence.&lt;ref name="Neisser et al. 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deary, Johnson &amp; Houlihan 2009"/&gt; In biology heritability  is defined as the ratio of variation attributable to genetic differences in an observable [[trait (biology)|trait]] to the trait's total observable variation. The heritability of a trait describes the proportion of variation in the trait that is attributable to genetic factors within a particular population. A heritability of 1 indicates that variation correlates fully with genetic variation and a heritability of 0 indicates that there is no correlation between the trait and genes at all. In psychological testing, heritability tends to be understood as the degree of correlation between the results of a test taker and those of their biological parents. However, since high heritability is simply a correlation between traits and genes, it does not describe the causes of heritability which in humans can be either genetic or environmental.

Therefore, a high heritability measure does not imply that a trait is genetic or unchangeable, however, as environmental factors that affect all group members equally will not be measured by heritability and the heritability of a trait may also change over time in response to changes in the distribution of genes and environmental factors.&lt;ref name="Neisser et al. 1996"/&gt;  High heritability also doesn't imply that all of the heritability is genetically determined, but can also be due to environmental differences that affect only a certain genetically defined group (indirect heritability).&lt;ref name="Block 2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Block|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure to the left demonstrates how heritability works. In both gardens the difference between tall and short cornstalks is 100% heritable as cornstalks that are genetically disposed for growing tall will become taller than those without this disposition, but the difference in height between the cornstalks to the left and those on the right is 100% environmental as it is due to different nutrients being supplied to the two gardens. Hence the causes of differences within a group and between groups may not be the same, even when looking at traits that are highly heritable.&lt;ref name="Block 2002" /&gt; In his [[The Bell Curve#Cognitive sorting|criticism of ''the Bell Curve'']], [[Noam Chomsky]] further illustrated this with the example of women wearing earrings:{{quote|To borrow an example from Ned Block, "some years ago when only women wore earrings, the heritability of having an earring was high because differences in whether a person had an earring was due to a chromosomal difference, XX vs. XY." No one has yet suggested that wearing earrings, or ties, is "in our genes," an inescapable fate that environment cannot influence, "dooming the liberal notion."&lt;ref name=Rollback&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/articles/199505--.htm#TXT2.23 Rollback, Part II] Noam Chomsky, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In regards to the IQ gap the question becomes whether racial groups can be shown to be influenced by different environmental factors that may account for the observed differences between them. Jensen originally argued that given the high heritability of IQ the only way that the IQ gap could be explained as caused by the environment would be if it could be shown that all blacks were subject to a single "x-factor" which affected no white populations while affecting all black populations equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jensen|first=A.R.|year=1998|title=''The ''g'' factor: The science of mental ability''|location=Westport, CT|publisher=Praeger|isbn= 0-275-96103-6|ref=harv|pages=456–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen considered the existence of such an x-factor to be extremely improbable, but Flynn's discovery of the Flynn effect showed that in spite of high heritability environmental factors could cause considerable disparities in IQ between generations of the same population, showing that the existence of such an x-factor was not only possible but real.{{sfn|Flynn|2012|pages=134–141}}

Jensen has also argued that heritability of traits rises with age as the genetic potential of individuals becomes expressed. He sees this as related to the fact that the IQ gap between white and black test takers has been shown to appear gradually, with the gap widening as cohorts reach adulthood. This he sees as a further argument in favor of Spearman's hypothesis (see section below).

In contrast, Dickens and Flynn argued that the conventional interpretation ignores the role of [[feedback]] between factors, such as those with a small initial IQ advantage, genetic or environmental, seeking out more stimulating environments which will gradually greatly increase their advantage, which, as one consequence in their alternative model, would mean that the "heritability" figure is only in part due to direct effects of genotype on IQ.{{sfn|Hunt|Carlson|2007}}{{sfn|Nisbett|2009|p=212}}{{sfn|Dickens|Flynn|2001}}

Today researchers such as {{harvp|Hunt|2010}}, {{harvp|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012}} and {{harvp|Mackintosh|2011}} consider that rather than a single factor accounting for the entire gap, probably many different environmental factors differ systematically between the environments of White and Black people converge to create part of the gap and perhaps all of it. They argue that it does not make sense to talk about a single universal heritability figure for IQ, rather, they state, heritability of IQ varies between and within groups. They point specifically to studies showing a higher heritability of test scores in White and medium-high SES families, but considerably lower heritability for Black and low-SES families. This they interpret to mean that children who grow up with limited resources do not get to develop their full genetic potential.{{sfn|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012}}

Multiple studies have been conducted over the past several decades to survey scientific estimates on the heritability of the IQ gap. A [[The IQ Controversy, the Media and Public Policy (book)|review by Snydermann and Rothman]] in 1988 found that 45% of the scientists they questioned believed the gap to be "a product of genetic and environmental variation," 15% and 1% respectively "entirely to environmental" and "genetic variation," while the remaining 38% either declined to answer or stated that the evidence was inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Snyderman &amp; Rothman (1987:255), cited in Eysenck (1994:66).&lt;/ref&gt; The heritability of intelligence was estimated on average to be 59.6% for white Americans and 57.0% for black Americans among those who answered that the evidence was sufficiently conclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Wall Street Journal'' published an [[Mainstream Science on Intelligence|editorial by Linda Gottfredson in 1994]], signed by 52 professors specializing in intelligence and allied fields, that estimated the heritability of individual variation to range between 40–80%, but also stating that "there is no definitive answer" to explain the racial gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Mainstream Science on Intelligence: An Editorial With 52 Signatories, History, and Bibliography|author=Linda S.

This survey however yielded a response rate of 18% (228 participants) compared to Snyderman &amp; Rothman's 65% (661 participants).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=2013 survey of expert opinion on intelligence|authors=Heiner Rindermann, Thomas R.

===Spearman's hypothesis===
{{Main|Spearman's hypothesis}}
Spearman's hypothesis states that the magnitude of the black-white difference in tests of cognitive ability is entirely or mainly a function of the extent to which a test measures general mental ability, or ''g''. The hypothesis was first formalized by [[Arthur Jensen]] who devised the statistical Method of Correlated Vectors to test it. Jensen holds that if Spearman's hypothesis holds true then some cognitive tasks have a higher g-load than others, and that these tasks are exactly the tasks in which the gap between Black and White test takers are greatest. Jensen, and other psychometricians such as Rushton and Lynn, take this to show that the cause of ''g'' and the cause of the gap are the same—in their view genetic differences.{{sfn|Rushton|Jensen|2005}}

{{harvtxt|Mackintosh|2011|pages=338–39}} acknowledges that Jensen and Rushton have shown a modest correlation between g-loading, heritability, and the test score gap, but he does not accept that this demonstrates a genetic origin of the gap. He points out that it is exactly in those the tests that Rushton and Jensen consider to have the highest g-loading and heritability such as the Wechsler that has seen the highest increases due to the Flynn effect. This suggests that they are also the most sensitive to environmental changes. And in turn, if the highly g-loaded tests are both more liable to environmental influences and as Jensen argues, the ones where the black-white gap is most pronounced, it suggests in fact contrary to Jensen's argument that the gap is most likely caused by environmental factors. Mackintosh also argues that Spearman's hypothesis, which he considers to be likely to be correct, simply shows that the test score gap is based on whatever cognitive faculty is central to intelligence, but not what this factor is.{{harvtxt|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012|page=146}} make the same point, noting also that the increase in the IQ scores of Black test takers is necessarily also an increase in ''g''.

James {{harvtxt|Flynn|2012|pages=140–1}} argues that there is an inherent flaw in Jensen's argument that the correlation between g-loadings, test scores and heritability support a genetic cause of the gap. He points out that as the difficulty of a task increases a low performing group will naturally fall further behind, and heritability will therefore also naturally increase. The same holds for increases in performance which will first affect the least difficult tasks, but only gradually affect the most difficult ones. Flynn thus sees the correlation between in g-loading and the test score gap to offer no clue to the cause of the gap.{{sfn|Flynn|2010}}

{{harvtxt|Hunt|2010|page=415}} states that many of conclusions of Jensen, and his colleagues rest on the validity of Spearman's hypothesis, and the method of correlated vectors used to test it. Hunt points out that other researchers have found this method of calculation to produce false positive results, and that other statistical methods should be used instead. According to Hunt, Jensen and Rushton's frequent claim that Spearman's hypothesis should be regarded as empirical fact does not hold, and that new studies based on better statistical methods would be required to confirm or reject the hypothesis that the correlation between g-loading, heritability and the IQ gap is due to IQ gaps consisting mostly of g.

===Adoption studies===
A number of studies have been done on the effect of similar rearing conditions on children from different races. The hypothesis is that by investigating whether black children adopted into white families demonstrated gains in IQ test scores relative to black children reared in black families. Depending on whether their test scores are more similar to their biological or adoptive families, that could be interpreted as either supporting a genetic or an environmental hypothesis. The main point of critique in studies like these however is whether the environment of black children—even when raised in white families—is truly comparable to the environment of white children. Several reviews of the [[adoption study]] literature has pointed out that it is perhaps impossible to avoid confounding of biological and environmental factors in this type of studies.{{sfn|Mackintosh|2011|p=337}} Given the differing heritability estimates in medium-high SES and low-SES families, {{harvtxt|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012|pages=134}} argue that adoption studies on the whole tend to overstate the role of genetics because they represent a restricted set of environments, mostly in the medium-high SES range.

The [[Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study]] (1976) examined the [[intelligence quotient|IQ]] test scores of 122 [[adopted]] children and 143 nonadopted children reared by advantaged white families. The children were restudied ten years later.&lt;ref name="Weinberg 1992"&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberg|Scarr|Waldman|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Scarr|Weinberg|1976}}{{sfn|Loehlin|2000|p=185}} The study found higher IQ for whites compared to blacks, both at age 7 and age 17.&lt;ref name="Weinberg 1992"/&gt; {{harvp|Rushton|Jensen|2005}} cite the Minnesota study as providing support to a genetic explanation. Nonetheless, acknowledging the existence of confounding factors, Scarr and Weinberg the authors of the original study, did not themselves consider that it provided support for either the hereditarian or environmentalist view.{{sfn|Scarr|Weinberg|1990}}

Three other adoption studies found contrary evidence to the Minnesota study, lending support to a mostly environmental hypothesis: 
*{{harvp|Eyferth|1961}} studied the out-of-wedlock children of black and white soldiers stationed in Germany after World War 2 and then raised by white German mothers and found no significant differences. 
*{{harvp|Tizard et al.|1972}} studied black (West Indian), white, and mixed-race children raised in British long-stay residential nurseries. Two out of three tests found no significant differences. One test found higher scores for non-whites.
*{{harvp|Moore|1986}} compared black and mixed-race children adopted by either black or white middle-class families in the United States. Moore observed that 23 black and interracial children raised by white parents had a significantly higher mean score than 23 age-matched children raised by black parents (117 vs 104), and argued that differences in early socialization explained these differences.

Rushton and Jensen have argued that unlike the Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study, these studies did not retest the children post-adolescence when heritability of IQ would presumably be higher.&lt;ref name="Rushton &amp; Jensen 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rushton &amp; Jensen 2005"/&gt;  {{harvtxt|Nisbett|2009|p=226}} however point out that the difference in heritability between ages 7 and 17 are quite small, and that consequently this is no reason to disregard Moore's findings.

Frydman and Lynn (1989) showed a mean IQ of 119 for Korean infants adopted by Belgian families. After correcting for the [[Flynn effect]], the IQ of the adopted Korean children was still 10 points higher than the indigenous Belgian children.{{sfn|Loehlin|2000|p=187}}{{sfn|Rushton|Jensen|2005}}&lt;ref name="Frydman and Lynn"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frydman and Lynn |journal=Personality and Individual Differences  |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=1323–1325|year=1989 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886989902468 |title=The intelligence of Korean children adopted in Belgium|ref=harv |doi=10.1016/0191-8869(89)90246-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the evidence from adoption studies Mackintosh considers the studies by Tizard and Eyferth to be inconclusive, and the Minnesota study to be consistent only with a partial genetic hypothesis. On the whole he finds that environmental and genetic variables remain confounded and considers evidence from adoption studies inconclusive on the whole, and fully compatible with a 100% environmental explanation.{{sfn|Mackintosh|2011|page=337}}

===Racial admixture studies===
Most people have an ancestry from different geographic regions, particularly African Americans typically have ancestors from both Africa and Europe, with, on average, 20% of their genome inherited from European ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryc et al.|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; If racial IQ gaps have a partially genetic basis, one might expect blacks with a higher degree of European ancestry to score higher on IQ tests than blacks with less European ancestry, because the genes inherited from European ancestors would likely include some genes with a positive effect on IQ.{{sfn|Loehlin|2000}} Geneticist [[Alan Templeton]] has argued that an experiment based on the Mendelian "common garden" design where specimens with different hybrid compositions are subjected to the same environmental influences, would be the only way to definitively show a causal relation between genes and IQ. Summarizing the findings of admixture studies, he concludes that it has shown no significant correlation between any cognitive and the degree of African or European ancestry.{{sfn|Templeton|2001}}

Studies have employed different ways of measuring or approximating relative degrees of ancestry from Africa and Europe. One set of studies have used skin color as a measure, and other studies have used blood groups. {{harvp|Loehlin|2000}} surveys the literature and argues that the blood groups studies may be seen as providing some support to the genetic hypothesis, even though the correlation between ancestry and IQ was quite low. He finds that studies by {{harvp|Eyferth|1961}}, Willerman, Naylor &amp; Myrianthopoulos (1970) did not find a correlation between degree of African/European ancestry and IQ. The latter study did find a difference based on the race of the mother, with children of white mothers with black fathers scoring higher than children of black mothers and white fathers. Loehlin considers that such a finding is compatible with either a genetic or an environmental cause. All in all Loehlin finds admixture studies inconclusive and recommends more research.

Another study cited by {{harvp|Rushton|Jensen|2005}}, and by {{harvp|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012}}, was {{harvp|Moore|1986}} study which found that adopted mixed-race children's has test scores identical to children with two black parents—receiving no apparent "benefit" from their white ancestry. Rushton and Jensen find admixture studies to have provided overall support for a genetic explanation though this view is not shared by {{harvp|Loehlin|2000}}, {{harvp|Nisbett|2009}}, {{harvp|Hunt|2010}}, {{harvp|Mackintosh|2011}}, nor by {{harvp|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012}}.

Reviewing the evidence from admixture studies {{harvp|Hunt|2010}} considers it to be inconclusive because of too many uncontrolled variables. {{harvtxt|Mackintosh|2011|p=338}} quotes a statement by {{harvp|Nisbett|2009}} to the effect that admixture studies have not provided a shred of evidence in favor of a genetic basis for the gap.

===Mental chronometry===
{{Main|Mental chronometry}}
[[Mental chronometry]] measures the elapsed time between the presentation of a sensory stimulus and the subsequent behavioral response by the participant. This reaction time (RT) is considered a measure of the speed and efficiency with which the brain processes information.&lt;ref name="Jensen 2006"&gt;{{harvnb|Jensen|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scores on most types of RT tasks tend to correlate with scores on standard IQ tests as well as with ''g'', and no relationship has been found between RT and any other psychometric factors independent of ''g''.&lt;ref name="Jensen 2006"/&gt; The strength of the correlation with IQ varies from one RT test to another, but [[Hans Eysenck]] gives 0.40 as a typical correlation under favorable conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eysenck|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jensen individual differences in RT have a substantial genetic component, and heritability is higher for performance on tests that correlate more strongly with IQ.&lt;ref name="Jensen 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Jensen|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nisbett argues that some studies have found correlations closer to 0.2, and that the correlation is not always found.&lt;ref name="Nisbett 2009"&gt;{{harvnb|Nisbett|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--page number needed--&gt;

Several studies have found differences between races in average reaction times. These studies have generally found that reaction times among black, Asian and white children follow the same pattern as IQ scores.{{sfn|Lynn|Vanhanen|2002}}{{sfn|Jensen|Whang|1993}}{{sfn|Pesta|Poznanski|2008}} Black-white differences in reaction time, however, tend to be small (average [[effect size]] .18).{{sfn|Sheppard|Vernon|2008}} {{harvp|Rushton|Jensen|2005}} have argued that reaction time is independent of culture and that the existence of race differences in average reaction time is evidence that the cause of racial IQ gaps is partially genetic instead of entirely cultural. Responding to this argument in ''Intelligence and How to Get It'', Nisbett has pointed to the {{harvp|Jensen|Whang|1993}} study in which a group of Chinese Americans had longer reaction times than a group of European Americans, despite having higher IQs. Nisbett also mentions findings in {{harvp|Flynn|1991}} and {{harvp|Deary|2001}} suggesting that movement time (the measure of how long it takes a person to move a finger after making the decision to do so) correlates with IQ just as strongly as reaction time, and that average movement time is faster for blacks than for whites.{{sfn|Nisbett|2009|pp=221–2}} {{harvtxt|Mackintosh|2011|page=339}} considers reaction time evidence unconvincing and points out that other cognitive tests that also correlate well with IQ show no disparity at all, for example the habituation/[[dishabituation]] test. And he points out that studies show that rhesus monkeys have shorter reaction times than American college students, suggesting that different reaction times may not tell us anything useful about intelligence.

===Brain size===
{{main|Brain size}}
A number of studies have reported a moderate statistical correlation between differences in IQ and brain size between individuals in the same group.{{sfn|Deary|Penke|Johnson|2010}}{{sfn|McDaniel|2005}} And some scholars have reported differences in average brain sizes between Africans, Europeans, and Asians.{{sfn|Ho et al.|1980}} J. P. Rushton has argued that Africans on average have smaller brain cases and brains than Europeans, that Europeans have smaller brains than East Asians, and that this is evidence that the gap is biological in nature. Critics of Rushton have argued that Rushton's arguments rest on outdated data collected by unsound methods and should be considered invalid.{{sfn|Lieberman|2001}} Recent reviews by {{harvp|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012a}} and {{harvp|Mackintosh|2011}} consider that current data does show an average difference in brain size and head-circumference between American Blacks and Whites, but question whether this has any relevance for the IQ gap. Nisbett et al. argue that crude brain size is unlikely to be a good measure of IQ; for example, brain size also differs between men and women, but without well-documented differences in IQ. At the same time newborn Black children have the same average brain size as Whites, suggesting that the difference in average size could be accounted for by differences in postnatal environment. Several factors that reduce brain size have been demonstrated to disproportionately affect Black children.{{sfn|Nisbett|Aronson|Blair|Dickens|2012a}}

[[Earl B. Hunt|Earl Hunt]] states that brain size is found to have a correlation of about .35 with intelligence among whites and cites studies showing that genes may account for as much as 90% of individual variation in brain size. According to Hunt, race differences in average brain size could potentially be an important argument for a possible genetic contribution to racial IQ gaps. Nonetheless, Hunt notes that Rushton's head size data would account for a difference of .09 standard deviations between Black and White average test scores, less than a tenth of the 1.0 standard deviation gap in average scores that is observed.{{sfn|Hunt|Carlson|2007}}{{sfn|Hunt|2010|pp=433–434}} Wicherts, Borsboom, &amp; Dolan (2010) argue that black-white differences in brain size are insufficient to explain 91% to 95% of the black-white IQ gap.{{sfn|Wicherts|Borsboom|Dolan|2010b}}

===Archaeological data===
Archaeological evidence does not support claims by Rushton and others that blacks' cognitive ability was inferior to whites' during prehistoric times as a result of evolution.{{sfn|MacEachern|2006}}

==Policy relevance and ethics==
{{Main|Intelligence and public policy}}
The 1996 report of the APA commented on the [[ethics]] of research on race and intelligence.&lt;ref name="Hunt &amp; Carlson 2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|Carlson|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvp|Gray|Thompson|2004}} as well as {{harvp|Hunt|Carlson|2007}} have also discussed different possible ethical guidelines.&lt;ref name="Hunt &amp; Carlson 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|Thompson|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=February 2013}} [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] in 2009 featured two editorials on the ethics of research in race and intelligence by [[Steven Rose]] (against) and [[Stephen J. Ceci]] and [[Wendy M. Williams]] (for).&lt;ref name="Ceci &amp; Williams 2009"&gt;{{harvnb|Ceci|Williams|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rose 2009"&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|2009|pp=786–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to critics, research on group differences in IQ will reproduce the negative effects of social ideologies (such as [[Nazism]] or [[social Darwinism]]) that were justified in part on claimed hereditary racial differences.&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AAA 1994"&gt;{{cite web |last=American Anthropological Association |title=Statement on "Race" and Intelligence |year=1994 |url=http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/race.htm |accessdate=March 31, 2010 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Rose]] maintains that the history of [[eugenics]] makes this field of research difficult to reconcile with current ethical standards for science.&lt;ref name="Rose 2009"/&gt;

[[Linda Gottfredson]] argues that suggestion of higher ethical standards for research into group differences in intelligence is a [[double standard]] applied in order to undermine disliked results.&lt;ref name="Gottfredson 2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Gottfredson|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Flynn (academic)|James R. Flynn]] has argued that had there been a ban on research on possibly poorly conceived ideas, much valuable research on intelligence testing (including his own discovery of the [[Flynn effect]]) would not have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flynn|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jensen and Rushton argued that the existence of biological group differences does not rule out, but raises questions about the worthiness of policies such as [[affirmative action]] or placing a premium on diversity. They also argued for the importance of teaching people not to overgeneralize or [[stereotype]] individuals based on average group differences, because of the significant overlap of people with varying intelligence between different races.&lt;ref name="Rushton &amp; Jensen 2005"/&gt;

The environmentalist viewpoint argues for increased interventions in order to close the gaps.&lt;ref name="Brookings"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jencks|first1=Christopher|last2=Phillips|first2=Meredith|title=The Black-White Test Score Gap|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/j/jencks-gap.html|website=New York Times|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nisbett argues that schools can be greatly improved and that many interventions at every age level are possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nisbett|2009}}&lt;!--page number needed (I have the source and should be able to find the page number) --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn, arguing for the importance of the black subculture, writes that "America will have to address all the aspects of black experience that are disadvantageous, beginning with the regeneration of inner city neighbourhoods and their schools. A resident police office and teacher in every apartment block would be a good start."&lt;ref name="Flynn 2008"&gt;{{harvnb|Flynn|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers from both sides agree that interventions should be better researched.&lt;ref name="Nisbett 2009"/&gt;&lt;!--page number needed (other references are also available, as in a section above in this article) --&gt;&lt;ref name="Rushton &amp; Jensen 2010"/&gt;

Especially in developing nations, society has been urged to take on the prevention of cognitive impairment in children as of the highest priority. Possible preventable causes include [[malnutrition]], [[infectious diseases]] such as [[meningitis]], [[parasites]], cerebral [[malaria]], [[in utero]] [[drug]] and [[alcohol]] exposure, newborn [[asphyxia]], [[low birth weight]], head injuries, [[lead poisoning]] and [[endocrine disorders]].&lt;ref name="Olness 2003"&gt;{{harvnb|Olness|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Kibbe accompanied prosecutors and detectives to a dry creek he remembered to try to find the body of Lou Ellen Burleigh, whom he had discarded in 1977. In 2007 a detective searched the area again. In 2009 Kibbe again returned to the site with detectives. Burleigh's body was not found and a Grand Jury was convened. &lt;ref name="dailypress1"/&gt; 

After a plea bargain to avoid the death penalty, on November 5, 2009, Kibbe was sentenced to an additional  six life sentences, this time for the murders of Lora Heedick, Barbara Ann Scott, Stephanie Brown, Charmaine Sabrah, Katherine Kelly Quinones, and Lou Ellen Burleigh.&lt;ref name="dailypress1"/&gt;

{{Slovenes}}
'''Slovene minority in Italy''' ({{lang-it|Minoranza slovena in Italia}}, {{lang-sl|Slovenska manjšina v Italiji}}), also known as '''Slovenes in Italy''' ({{lang-it|Sloveni in Italia}}, {{lang-sl|Slovenci v Italiji}}) is the name given to [[Italy|Italian]] citizens who belong to the autochthonous [[Slovenes|Slovene]] ethnic and linguistic minority living in the Italian autonomous region of [[Friuli – Venezia Giulia]]. The vast majority of members of the Slovene ethnic minority live in the [[Province of Trieste|Provinces of Trieste]], [[Province of Gorizia|Gorizia]], and [[Province of Udine|Udine]]. Estimates of their number vary significantly; the official figures show 24.706 Slovenian speakers in [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], as per the 1971 Census, but Slovenian estimates speak of 83,000 to 100,000 people.&lt;ref name="Glasgow"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zgs.zrc-sazu.si/Portals/8/Slo_Geo_Over/16.pdf |title=Ethnic Structure of Slovenia and Slovenes in Neighbouring Countries |work=Slovenia: a geographical overview |first=Jernej |last=Zupančič |publisher=Association of the Geographic Societies of Slovenia |date=August 2004 |accessdate=10 April 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atlas"&gt;Zupančič, Jernej (author), Orožen Adamič, Milan (photographer), Filipič, Hanzi (photographer): ''Slovenci po svetu''. In publication: ''Nacionalni atlas Slovenije'' (Kartografsko gradivo) / Inštitut za geografijo, Geografski inštitut Antona Melika. Ljubljana: Rokus, 2001.{{COBISS|ID=18593837}}{{sl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Slovene minority in Italy enjoys legal protection of its collective rights, guaranteed by the Italian constitution and specific legislation, as well as by international treaties (especially the [[London Memorandum]] of 1954), and bilateral agreements initially stipulated first between Italy and [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (especially the [[Treaty of Osimo]] of 1975), and since 1991 between Italy and [[Slovenia]].

Since 1945, the Slovenes in Italy have enjoyed partial [[cultural autonomy]], including an education system in [[Slovene language|Slovene]]. They have a wide net of cultural and civic associations. The Slovene language is co-official in many of the municipalities with presence of the Slovene minority, and visual bilingualism is applied in most of the non-urban settlements with traditional Slovene presence. However, the implementation of these rights largely depends on the local administrations; thus, the situation varies significantly from area to area. 
 
Both Italy and Slovenia promote Slovene culture in Friuli–Venezia Giulia through subsidies for Slovene associations and organizations.

== Name ==
The denomination “Slovenes in Italy” is preferred to “Italian Slovenes” or “Slovene Italians” due to historical reasons and reasons of identity. The Slovenes of the [[Julian March]] or Venezia Giulia (the present-day [[Province of Trieste|Provinces of Trieste]] and [[Province of Gorizia|Gorizia]]) became Italian citizens only with the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]] of 1920. In the late 1920s and 1930s, many of them supported underground [[anti-Fascist]] groups, such as [[TIGR]]. During [[World War II]] large portions of the population took part in the [[Yugoslav partisans|Yugoslav partisan movement]], and between 1945 and 1947, many of them actively supported the annexation to [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. In the aftermath of World War II, their integration in the Italian state was slow and difficult: much of the anti-Slav Fascist legislation (for example, the forced Italianization of family names) remained valid, and in the context of the [[Cold War]], the Slovene minority was regarded by many political parties, as well as by segments of State institutions, as a potential Yugoslav [[Trojan Horse]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

After 1947, the term ''zamejski Slovenci'' (literally meaning “Slovenes beyond the Border”) started to be used by the Yugoslav press and institutions, especially in [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]]. Initially, this term referred to all Slovene minorities residing outside Yugoslavia (besides the Slovenes in Italy, the [[Carinthian Slovenes]] and [[Hungarian Slovenes]]). This is still the way how the term is used by the institutions of the Slovenian State. However, since alternative terms exist for Slovene minorities in Austria and Hungary, the term ''zamejski Slovenci'' tends to be used mostly for the Slovenes in Italy. This term is often used also by the Slovenes in Italy themselves, and is considered a neutral and politically correct term.

The Slovene minority in Italy lives in the autonomous region [[Friuli – Venezia Giulia]], more precisely, in the [[Province of Trieste|Provinces of Trieste]], [[Province of Gorizia|Gorizia]] and [[Province of Udine|Udine]]. Slovene immigrants living in other parts of Italy are not considered as members of the minority.
Slovenes live along the border with [[Slovenia]]. Their traditional area of settlement includes:
* the hinterland territory of the Province of Trieste (except for the town center of [[Muggia]], which was until 1945 a homogeneous [[Istrian Italians|Istrian Italian]] urban settlement);
* a thin strip of territory along the border with Slovenia in the Province of Gorizia, including the town of [[Gorizia]];
* the mountainous area of north-east [[Friuli]] in the Province of Udine, known historically as [[Venetian Slovenia]], comprising the [[Natisone]] Valley, the upper [[Torre (river)|Torre]] Valley, and the [[Resia Valley]];
* the [[Canale Valley]] (Province of Udine) in the north-easternmost part of Italy, on the border with [[Austria]] and Slovenia.

Historically, the Slovene minority has been present in 32 municipalities in the region: 6 in the Province of Trieste, 6 in the Province of Gorizia and 20 in the Province of Udine. In 16 of them, they are the majority of the population. In addition to these, since the early 1920s, the Slovenes have been settling in the industrial areas of the lower [[Isonzo]] valley, in the lowland areas around [[Monfalcone]], known as [[Bisiacaria]], and in larger Friulian towns (such as [[Udine]], [[Pordenone]], [[Conegliano]] and others). The former are nowadays considered members of the Slovene autochthonous minority and thus enjoy certain collective minority rights, while the latter don’t. 
Municipalities with significant presence of the autochthonous Slovene minority are as following.

* [[Duino-Aurisina]] (''Devin-Nabrežina'')
* [[Monrupino]] (''Repentabor'')

== Ethnic and territorial identity ==
The Slovene minority in Italy is highly differentiated along geographic, cultural-historical, identity and linguistic lines. 
In cultural-historical terms, three separate groups can be differentiated: the Slovenes of the [[Julian March]] (the Provinces of Trieste and Gorizia), the Slovenes from [[Venetian Slovenia]], and the Slovenes from the [[Canale Valley]] (in the Province of Udine). Each of these three groups has had a significantly different history, which resulted in different identities. The Slovenes in the [[Resia Valley]] are sometimes considered as a fourth group, due to their specific linguistic features and separate identity; nevertheless, they share a common history, as well as similar cultural and linguistic features with the Slovenes from Venetian Slovenia.

=== Slovenes of Trieste and Gorizia ===
[[File:Slovenian celebration in Basovizza in 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Some Basovizza residents in traditional [[Karst Plateau|Karst]] dress at a celebration]]
[[File:Carta identita prov Trieste.jpg|220px|thumbnail|right|A bilingual [[identity card]] issued in Trieste]]
The Slovenes living in the Provinces of Trieste and Gorizia shared, until 1918, the same history with most other [[Slovenes]]: by the end of the 15th century, they were included in the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], and in the 19th Century they actively participated in the Slovene national revival. Between 1849 and 1918, they were part of the Austrian administrative region known as [[Austrian Littoral]], and were known as Littoral Slovenes (''Primorski Slovenci''). After 1918, they came under [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italian]] administration and were included in the region known as the [[Julian March]] (''Venezia Giulia''). They shared the same fate as other Slovenes in the Julian March: they were subjected to [[Fascist Italianization]], which gave rise to [[TIGR|pro-Yugoslav irredentism]]. In 1947, after World War II, a new border between Italy and Yugoslavia was drawn, dividing the Julian March between the two states. The border was artificial, insofar as it was not based on any significant historical or geographical divides. In many cases, the border separated families and ran through fields and estates. All these reasons contributed to the strong connection between the Slovenes who remained in Italy with their counterparts that were annexed to Yugoslavia.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Until the 1950s and 1960s, the Slovenes from the Provinces of Gorizia and Trieste frequently referred to themselves as Littoral Slovenes. Since the 1960s, this identification with the [[Slovenian Littoral]] has faded, but it can still be traced in the names of certain institutions, most notably in the title of the Slovene daily newspaper of Trieste, called ''[[Primorski dnevnik]]'' which means “The Littoral Daily”. Between the 1940s and 1960s, the Slovenes from the Provinces of Gorizia and Trieste established the infrastructure of minority organizations that now serve the needs of the whole minority. They have enjoyed a certain degree of cultural autonomy (the most important feature being the education system in Slovene) since 1945, and they have maintained strong relations with Slovenia, especially with the neighboring border areas of the Slovenian Littoral.
In 1986 the Slovenian community founded the football club [[N.K. Kras A.S.D.|Kras Repen]], which locates its fan base among the Slovenes in Italy.

=== Venetian Slovenia ===
{{main|Venetian Slovenia}}

Venetian Slovenia ({{lang-sl|Beneška Slovenija}}, {{lang-it|Slavia Veneta}}) is the traditional name for Slovene-speaking areas in the valleys of upper [[Natisone]] and [[Torre (river)|Torre]] rivers in eastern [[Friuli]] (currently in the [[Province of Udine]]). The history of these areas has been strongly linked to the history of Friuli. Unlike most other ethnic Slovene territories (including the areas of Gorizia and Trieste), this region was part of the [[Venetian Republic]] for around 350 years (hence the name of the region). During that period, they enjoyed a large degree of autonomy.

The Slovenes in this area were annexed to Italy together with the rest of the [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] region in 1866, that is, half a century before the Slovenes of Gorizia and Trieste, who remained under Austrian rule until after [[World War I]]. 

For long, the identity of the local Slovenes was mostly a linguistic and, to an extent, an ethnic one, but not a national one. The Slovenes of these areas lacked any form of collective minority or linguistic rights until the year 2000, when the Law for the Defense of the Slovene-Speaking Minority was passed by the Italian Parliament.

=== Canale Valley Slovenes ===
Around 3,000 Slovenes live in the [[Canale Valley]] in the north-easternmost part of the [[Province of Udine]]. The valley is currently divided among three municipalities: [[Tarvisio]] (''Trbiž''), [[Malborghetto Valbruna]] (''Naborjet - Ovčja vas''), and [[Pontebba]] (''Tablja''). Most of the local Slovenes live in the first two, representing around half of the population in Malborghetto Valbruna and a lower percentage in Tarvisio. 

Until 1918, the Canale Valley (''Kanalska dolina'') was part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Since the Middle Ages, it was a part of the [[Duchy of Carinthia]]. The local Slovene speakers shared the same history, traditions and linguistic features with other [[Carinthian Slovene]]s. According to the last Austrian census of 1910, the valley had around 9,000 inhabitants, among whom around a third were Slovene speakers, with the remainder [[German language|German]] speakers. In 1918, after the end of World War I, the valley was occupied by the Italian Army, and in 1919 it was officially annexed to Italy. In the 1920s and 1930s, many Italians were settled in this area, which bordered both Austria and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. In 1939, the [[South Tyrol Option Agreement]] between Italy and [[Nazi Germany]] was also applied to ethnic Germans in the area; as a conqequence, most of the German-speaking population was resettled to neighboring [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]]. New settlers from other parts of Italy gradually took their place, which significantly altered the ethnic composition of the valley.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Nowadays, Slovene is still spoken in several villages in the valley, especially Valbruna (''Ovčja vas''), Camporosso in Valcanale (''Žabnice''), Ugovizza (''Ukve''), and San Leopoldo (''Lipalja vas''). There has been a revival of Slovene language in these villages after 1990, with a focus on the younger generations.

=== Resia Valley ===
{{main|Resia, Friuli}}
[[File:Bilingual road sign in Resia-Rezjia.jpg|230px|thumbnail|right|Bilingual Italian-[[Resian dialect|Resian]] road sign in the [[Resia Valley]], [[Friuli]]]]

The inhabitants of the [[Resia, Friuli|Resia Valley]] in north-western [[Friuli]] speak a specific dialect of Slovene, known as [[Resian dialect|Resian]]. Due to its specific phonetic features and archaic grammar, Resian is not mutually intelligible with standard Slovene and with most other [[Slovene dialects]]. Historically and culturally (as well as linguistically), Resia could be considered a part of [[Venetian Slovenia]]. According to Italian and regional legislation, Resians are considered as part of the Slovene minority in Italy; however, there are strong local movements that oppose identification with Slovenes and Slovene language, and defend a separate Resian identity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

'''Sole custody''' arrangements have been generally considered a traditional form of [[Child custody|custody]] for many in the past; however, there has been a trend since the 1980s towards the notion that joint custody arrangements are more favorable than sole custody arrangements.&lt;ref name = "Surviving the Breakup"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Judith S.

==Other forms of custody==

*[[Bird's nest custody]] is an arrangement whereby the parents go back and forth from a residence in which the child/children reside, placing the burden of upheaval and movement on the parents rather than the child/children.
*[[Joint custody]] is an arrangement whereby both parents have legal custody and/or both parents have physical custody.
*[[Split custody]] is an arrangement whereby one parent has full-time custody over some children, and the other parent has full custody over the other children.
*[[Third-party custody]] is an arrangement in whereby the children do not remain with either biological parent, and are placed under the custody of a third person.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Stockgen.jpg|thumb|An image of the site]] --&gt;
'''Stock Generation''' was a website that ran from 1998 to early 2000 and is now part of Internet lore as the longest-running, most infamous [[Ponzi scheme]] in the history of the [[Internet]]. Stock Generation allowed people to trade "virtual companies" using real money and promised enormous returns on investment.

==History==
The website was run from an island in the Caribbean, and the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] was unable to cite Stock Generation's founders and owners (members of the Russian conglomerate [[MMM (Ponzi scheme)|MMM]]) for securities violations. In late 1999, participants began to experience difficulties in redeeming their virtual shares. Finally, in 2000, the market "crashed". On March 20, 2000, SG unilaterally suspended all pending requests to withdraw funds and sharply reduced participants' account balances in all companies except the privileged company. (Applying "Rule 13" to all participants' accounts.) Two weeks later, SG peremptorily announced a reverse stock split for its highest-yield company, applying "Rule 18", which caused the share prices to plummet to less than 1/10,000 of their previous values, while other shares (including those that were "guaranteed" not to decrease in value) were devalued by 50% to 95%. At about the same time, SG stopped responding to participant requests for the return of funds, yet continued to solicit new participants through its website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/2001/09/27/sinrod.htm Virtual investment gaming leads to SEC prosecution&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEC then sued in the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts]], alleging that the "virtual stock exchange" was in effect a [[Ponzi scheme]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/claims/sgltd.htm SG Ltd. (Stock Generation Ltd.) et al.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled in favor of Stock Generation, stating that the site adequately described the market as "a game" not an investment vehicle. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] later reversed the District Court, stating that "the opportunity to invest in the shares of the privileged company, described on SG's website, constituted an invitation to enter into an investment contract within the jurisdictional reach of the federal securities laws." {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The game was shut down around June 1, 2000.

==Operation==
StockGeneration website traded shares of 11 "virtual" companies. Each of those companies had its name and logo, but they were most often referred to by the number under which they were listed.

Companies 1 to 8 were traded for purely "gambling" purposes, as their shares could go up and down randomly. Having those 8 companies "trading" on their website, allowed StockGeneration to claim its enterprise as online gambling venture, rather than an actual stock market or any other investment-related business to which SEC rules would apply.

Company 9 was the "privileged" company, with its shares "guaranteed" never to decrease in value. Promised return was originally 10% a month (215% annually,) but was later reduced to 7% a month or 125% annually. In early April 2000, Stock Generation, despite all previous guarantees, devalued its privileged company shares to 5% of their previous value.

Companies 10 and 11 promised monthly returns of 50% and 100% (later 40% and 70%) respectively. At the same time, share prices could plummet 50% for company 10 and 100% (e.g. all the way down to 0) for company 11. That caveat (known as Rule 18) was another way for StockGeneration to justify their claims that this was a gambling website, rather than an investment vehicle.

Stock Generation was reluctant to use Rule 18 throughout most of the time the game was active. Instead they chose to apply another rule (known as Rule 13) which permitted StockGeneration to reduce individual account balances by recalculating them as if all the funds had been originally invested in the "privileged" company 9. So, a user that chose to invest his $50 sign-up bonus in the company 11 shares, kept the funds there for a year and then sought to withdraw all at once, could see his balance going down from $204,800 (100% monthly rate, compounded twice a week) to $157 (10% monthly rate compounded twice a week) and his transaction history would state that he had invested all those funds in the company 9 shares rather than in the company 11.

Rule 13 allowed StockGeneration to avoid massive 5- or 6- figure withdrawals, thus allowing the system to last over 2 years, with its share prices increasing over 10,000-fold. (As opposed to StockGeneration predecessor, the [[MMM (Ponzi scheme)|MMM]] which only lasted about 6 months, with its stock price increasing "only" 127-fold.) Judging from the complaints on the SG bulletin board, application of rule 13 had become widespread by early 2000, as demands for withdrawals increased. On March 20, 2000, Rule 13 was applied to every account.

Rule 18 was applied about two weeks later, for the first time since the game was launched. The value of the company 10 share was cut in half. Company 11 shares underwent a 1-for-10,000 [[reverse split]], with the actual share price plummeting to less than 1/100,000th of its value (from over $1 per share to $0.10 per "new" share, worth 10,000 old ones). On the same day, Stock Generation reduced the price of the company 9 shares from $16.90 to $0.84 - in clear violation of their own rules as those shares were guaranteed never to decrease in value.

Stock Generation continued to operate for several weeks after that, offering returns of up to 150% a month, but further legal troubles led to their website being halted by June 1, 2000.

==Legal opinion==
The description below is a quotation of the public information from the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]]&lt;ref&gt;:[http://laws.lp.findlaw.com/getcase/1st/case/011176&amp;exact=1 Appeal of SEC vs. Stock Generation], United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit&lt;/ref&gt;

"StockGeneration" website offering on-line denizens an opportunity to purchase shares in eleven different "virtual companies" listed on the website's "virtual stock exchange." SG arbitrarily set the purchase and sale prices of each of these imaginary companies in biweekly "rounds," and guaranteed that investors could buy or sell any quantity of shares at posted prices. SG placed no upper limit on the amount of funds that an investor could squirrel away in its virtual offerings.

The SEC's complaint focused on shares in a particular virtual enterprise referred to by SG as the "privileged company". SG advised potential purchasers to pay "particular attention" to shares in the privileged company and boasted that investing in those shares was a "game without any risk." To this end, its website announced that the privileged company's shares would unfailingly appreciate, boldly proclaiming that "[t]he share price of [the privileged company] is supported by the owners of SG, this is why its value constantly rises; on average at a rate of 10% monthly (this is approximately 215% annually)." To add plausibility to this representation and to allay anxiety about future pricing, SG published prices of the privileged company's shares one month in advance.

While SG conceded that a decline in the share price was theoretically possible, it assured prospective participants that "under the rules governing the fall in prices, [the share price for the privileged company] cannot fall by more than 5% in a round." To bolster this claim, it vouchsafed that shares in the privileged company were supported by several distinct revenue streams. According to SG's representations, capital inflow from new participants provided liquidity for existing participants who might choose to sell their virtual shareholdings. As a backstop, SG pledged to allocate an indeterminate portion of the profits derived from its website operations to a special reserve fund designed to maintain the price of the privileged company's shares. SG asserted that these profits emanated from four sources: (1) the collection of a 1.5% commission on each transaction conducted on its virtual stock exchange; (2) the bid-ask spread on the virtual shares; (3) the "skillful manipulation" of the share prices of eight particular imaginary companies, not including the privileged company, listed on the virtual stock exchange; and (4) SG's right to sell shares of three other virtual companies (including the privileged company). As a further hedge against adversity, SG alluded to the availability of auxiliary stabilization funds which could be tapped to ensure the continued operation of its virtual stock exchange.

SG's website contained lists of purported "big winners," an Internet bulletin board featuring testimonials from supposedly satisfied participants, and descriptions of incentive programs that held out the prospect of rewards for such activities as the referral of new participants (e.g., SG's representation that it would pay "20, 25 or 30% of the referred player's highest of the first three payments") and the establishment of affiliate websites.

According to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit, 800 United States domiciliaries, paying real cash, purchased virtual shares in the virtual companies listed on the defendants' virtual stock exchange.  SEC v. SG, Ltd et al., 265 F.3d 42 (1st Circuit 2001)

'''Tamil Malaysians''', also known as '''Malaysian Tamils''', are people of full or partial [[Tamil people|Tamil]] descent (from paternal descent) who were born in or  immigrated to [[Malaysia]] from Tamil Nadu in South East India and the Tamil regions of northern Sri Lanka that is being presently administered the government of Sri Lanka. They make up over 90% of the Malaysian Indian populations in Malaysia. The bulk of Tamil Malaysian migration began during the [[British Raj]], when [[British Empire|Britain]] facilitated the migration of Indian workers to work in plantations. There are also, however, some established Tamil communities spanning a millennium.&lt;ref name=rj&gt;[http://www.transcomm.ox.ac.uk/working%20papers/ravijain.pdf Culture and economy:Tamils in the plantation sector 1998-99] (April 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Precolonial period==

Relations between Tamils and Malaysia have existed for more than 2000 years. The ancient Tamil poetic work [[Paṭṭiṉappālai]] refers to the territory of modern Malaysia as ''Kaalagam'' (Tamil: காழகம்).&lt;ref&gt;திருநாவுக்கரசு, க.த., தென்கிழக்காசிய நாடுகளில் தமிழ்ப்பண்பாடு, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ulakaththamizh.org/JOTSpdf/061035052.pdf|title=Pathinenmaelkanakku|first=Uruttirangannanar|work=Paṭṭiṉappālai (பட்டினப் பாலை)|year=100 BCE – 100 CE|location=Tamil Nadu|pages=294|language=Tamil|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tamil literature from the 10th and 11th centuries refers to the modern Malaysian state of [[Kedah]] as ''Kadaram'' (Tamil: கடாரம்)

Prior to [[British Malaya|British colonization]], [[Tamil people|Tamils]] had been conspicuous in the [[archipelago]] much earlier, especially since the period of the powerful [[South India]]n kingdom of the [[Cholas]] in the 11th century. The [[Pallava dynasty]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] spread Tamil culture and the Tamil script to Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  by Peter Bellwood p.137&lt;/ref&gt; The Tamil emperor [[Rajendra Chola I]] of the [[Chola dynasty]] invaded Malaysia in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Southeast Asian Art: Essays in Honor of Stanley J. O'Connor  by Stanley J. O'Connor,Nora A. Taylor p.196&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Malay Peninsula]] had a strong Tamil culture in the 11th century, and Tamil merchant guilds were established in several locations.&lt;ref&gt;Southeast Asia: From Prehistory to History  by Ian Glover p.247&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, [[Tamil people|Tamils]] were among the important trading peoples of maritime Asia. Although the bulk of these immigrants to [[South East Asia]] had assimilated with the majority [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] ethnic group, some communities such as the [[Chitty|Malacca Chittys]] are remnants of the earlier migration history.&lt;ref name=Sneddon2003&gt;{{cite book | last = Sneddon| first = James|title = The Indonesian Language: Its history and role in modern society| year = 2003| publisher = University of South Wales Press Ltd| location = Sydney| pages = 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial period==
[[File:KITLV - 80018 - Kleingrothe, C.J. - Medan - Tamil girl, probably in Malaysia - circa 1910.tif|thumb|right|upright|A Tamil girl in [[Malay peninsula]], circa 1910.]]
During the British colonial era, [[Great Britain|Britain]] facilitated the migration of Indian workers to work in plantations. The overwhelming majority of migrants from India were ethnic [[Tamil people|Tamil]] and from the [[Madras Presidency]] of the [[British Empire]].

The [[Sri Lankan Tamils]], also known locally as Ceylonese Tamils, were employed principally in the civil and professional services.

Tamil Indian freedom fighters [[Maruthu Pandiyar]] relatives and 72 soldiers were deported to [[Penang]] in the year 1802 by the Madras Presidency Government (British India Government). &lt;ref&gt;சிவகங்கைச் சரித்திர அம்மானை. Madras Government Oriental Manuscripts Series No: 34&lt;/ref&gt;

== Siam Burma Death Railway==
[[File:Malaysian Tamils.jpg|thumb|left|Malaysian Tamils during the construction of Death railway between June 1942 to October 1943.]]

{{Main | Burma Railway}}

During the WWII Japanese army used more than 120,000 Tamils in the construction of 415 KM railway between [[Siam-Burma_Death_Railway_(film)|Siam and Burma]] to transport them army supplies. During this project half of them (around 60,000) perished. 

The recent research reveals that close to 150,000 Tamils perished during the project. The fell victim to snakes and insects, cholera, malaria and Beriberi. Some of them committed suicide, unable to bear the burden and the Japanese torture. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/the-real-kwai-killed-over-150-lakh-tamils/article9037199.ece | title = The real Kwai killed over 1.50 lakh Tamils | publisher = The Hindu | accessdate = Sep 21, 2016 | date = Aug 27, 2016 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
Tamil is an educational language in Malaysia, with more than 500 [[Tamil primary schools in Malaysia|Tamil medium schools]]. According to Harold Schiffman, an American researcher into Malaysian Tamils, compared to Singapore, language maintenance is favorable in Malaysia. However, he notes some Tamils are shifting to English and Malay.&lt;ref name=hs&gt;

==Economic condition==

Malaysian Tamils have had an opportunity to integrate with the expanding economy of Malaysia since 1970 under the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP). Although the bulk of them still remain as workers in the [[plantation]] sector in [[rubber]] and [[palm oil]] estates at those times very many have moved out as [[blue collar]] and [[White-collar worker|white collar]] workers in the expanding industrial sector. They are also found in civil service, professional sector, media and finance. One of Malaysia's wealthiest men [[Ananda Krishnan]] is a Malaysian Tamil origin. Overall it is one of the dynamic communities compared to other [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]] groups such as in [[Fiji]], [[Guyana]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].&lt;ref name=rj/&gt;

==Political condition==

The Malaysian political process is based on a cooperative political alliance of three major political parties, each representing an ethnic community. [[Malaysian Indian Congress]] (MIC) represents the interests of the [[Malaysian Indian]] community at the [[Central government|federal]] level. Due to overwhelming natural presence, Malaysian Tamils have come to dominate the MIC since its inception. [[Samy Vellu]], who is the longest serving leader of a mainstream Malaysian political party, having been MIC president since October 12, 1979 is a Malaysian Tamil, as are many of the office bearers of the party.
In recent times the underclass of the Indian community have been galvanized by the [[Hindu Rights Action Force]] (HINDRAF) to fight for their rights. HINDRAF was classified as an illegal organization on 15 October 2008 and most of its top leaders have been detained under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] (ISA). In July 2018 Malaysian police launched a probe into P. Ramasamy's, deputy chief minister of Penang, alleged ties to LTTE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/malaysian/Malaysia-Tamil-07192018175411.html | title=Malaysian Cops Launch Probe Over Politician’s Alleged Ties to Tamil Tigers |access-date=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bohemian Girl''''' is a 1922 [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]] [[romance film]] directed by [[Harley Knoles]] and starring [[Gladys Cooper]], [[Ivor Novello]] and [[C. Aubrey Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/27096 | title=The Bohemian Girl | publisher=BFI}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was inspired by the opera ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]'' by [[Michael William Balfe]] and [[Alfred Bunn]] which was in turn based on a novel by [[Cervantes]]. Originally released at 70 minutes, the surviving print is missing the first two reels and small portion of the last, timing at 46 minutes.

==Synopsis==
Arline is the little daughter of Count Arnheim, governor of an Austrian province who lives in feudal splendor near a forest where a Gypsy Queen and her tribe encamp, with her lieutenant, Devilshoof. He comes by chance upon Thaddeus, a young Polish refugee pursued by Austrian soldiers. Devilshoof protects the youth and offers him the concealment of gypsy garb. Arline escapes from the castle and is saved from a bear by Thaddeus, who with Devilshoof returns her to her father. It is in the midst of a banquet, that Thaddeus, a Pole, refuses to drink a toast to the Austrian emperor. Thaddeus is ejected in disgrace and Devilshoof vows to be revenged. He returns and, when the chance comes, carries Arline away. Twelve years of wandering finds Thaddeus part of the gypsy caravan and Arline grown to beautiful womanhood. Their love is discovered by the Gypsy Queen and because of her desire to wed Thaddeus she swears to accomplish the downfall of Arline. Count Florestein, a friend of Arline's father, is robbed of a medallion by the gypsies, who yield it to their Queen. This jewel the Queen gives to Arline when the girl sets out for a fair where she tells fortunes. Among her patrons is Florestein, who recognizes his medallion and orders the arrest of Arline. She is taken to the castle for trial, where, her own father is her judge. Count Arnheim is moved to gentleness he cannot understand and when the gypsy girl tells him her name he tremblingly summons the old nurse, who instantly recognizes her lost darling.

The '''timeline of [[children's rights]] in the United Kingdom''' includes a variety of events that are both [[political]] and [[grassroots]] in nature.

The UK government maintains a position that the United Nations [[UNCRC|Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (UNCRC) is not legally enforceable and is hence 'aspirational' only, although a 2003 [[ECHR]] ruling states that, "The human rights of children and the standards to which all governments must aspire in realising these rights for all children are set out in the Convention on the Rights of the Child."&lt;ref&gt;Extract from ''Sahin v Germany'', Grand Chamber judgment of the ECHR, 8 July 2003, as quoted in [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200304/jtselect/jtrights/161/16112.htm "4. Memorandum from Allan Levy QC and Peter Newell"], Joint Committee on Human Rights. Retrieved 18 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Eighteen years after ratification, the four Children's Commissioners in the UK (including those for the three devolved administrations) have united in calling for adoption of the Convention into domestic legislation, making children's rights recognised and legally binding.&lt;ref&gt;(2008) [http://www.11million.org.uk/resource/31f7xsa2gjgfc3l9t808qfsi.pdf UK Commissioners' Special Report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627173234/http://www.11million.org.uk/resource/31f7xsa2gjgfc3l9t808qfsi.pdf |date=27 June 2008 }}. UK Commissioners. p 34. Retrieved 29 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of children's rights often raise the objection that [[rights]] must entail [[Social responsibility|responsibilities]].&lt;ref&gt;Travis, A. [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/jun/19/youthjustice.politics "Children's jail staff given wider powers of restraint"], ''The Guardian'', London, 19 June 2007.&lt;!--Retrieved 25/7/08---&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[children's rights movement]] asserts rather that children have rights which adults, states and the government have a responsibility to uphold.&lt;ref&gt;Adtunji, J. [https://www.theguardian.com/society/9/7/08/youthjustice.children "Prisons: Child secure units still use adult restraint methods, says inspector"], ''The Guardian'', London, 9 July 2008.&lt;!---Retrieved 25/7/08---&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, a 2008 report stated that there had been no improvement in children's rights in the UK since 2002.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;(2008) [http://www.11million.org.uk/resource/31f7xsa2gjgfc3l9t808qfsi.pdf UK Commissioners' Special Report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627173234/http://www.11million.org.uk/resource/31f7xsa2gjgfc3l9t808qfsi.pdf |date=27 June 2008 }}. UK Commissioners. p 4. Retrieved 29 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Warning that there is a "[[Fear of children|widely held fear of children]] and [[Fear of youth|young people]]" in the UK, the report says: "The incessant portrayal of children as thugs and yobs" not only reinforces the fears of the public but also influences policy and legislation."&lt;ref&gt;(2008) ''[http://www.11million.org.uk/resource/31f7xsa2gjgfc3l9t808qfsi.pdf UK Commissioners' Special Report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627173234/http://www.11million.org.uk/resource/31f7xsa2gjgfc3l9t808qfsi.pdf |date=27 June 2008 }}''. UK Commissioners. p 33. Retrieved 29 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The report does not address the question of the degree to which the fear of uncontrolled children in the UK is justified.

The UNCRC defines children, for the purposes of the Convention, as persons under the age 18, unless domestic legislation provides otherwise. In that spirit, this timeline includes as children all those below the UK age of majority, which was 21 until 1970 when it was reduced to 18. Although the [[Crown Dependencies]] of the [[Isle of Man]], [[Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]] are not constitutionally part of the UK, the British government is responsible for their external affairs and therefore for their international treaty obligations, so this timeline includes references to matters in those dependencies.

| The care of [[Orphanage|orphans]] was particularly commended to bishops and monasteries during the Middle Ages. Many orphanages practised a form of "binding-out" in which children, as soon as they were old enough, were given as apprentices to households to ensure their support and their learning an occupation. [[Common law]] maintaining the [[Queen's peace|King's peace]] was administered by the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)]] dealing with civil cases between [[Party (law)|parties]] by ordering the fine of debts and seizure of the goods of outlaws. Following the [[Peasants' Revolt]], British [[constables]] were authorised under a [[Origins of the Poor Law system|1383 statute]] to collar [[Vagabond (person)|vagabond]]s and force them to show their means of support; if they could not, the penalty was gaol. Under a 1494 statute, vagabonds could be sentenced to the stocks for three days and nights; in 1530, whipping was added.&lt;ref&gt;Heinze, Rudolph W. (1976). [https://books.google.com/books?id=NR09AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''The proclamations of the Tudor kings''], p. 118. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-20938-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption was that vagabonds were unlicensed beggars.

| The national [[Church of Scotland]] set out a programme for spiritual reform, setting the principle of a [[History of education|school teacher]] for every parish church and [[free education]]. This was provided for by an Act of the [[Parliament of Scotland]], passed in 1633, which introduced a tax to pay for this programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rps.ac.uk/ Records of the Parliament of Scotland] official website.

| Elizabethan [[Poor Law]]
| The Poor Law was the social security system operating in England and Wales from the 16th century until the establishment of the Welfare State in the 20th century. The [[Impotent poor]] was a classification of poverty used to refer to those poor considered deserving of poor relief; a [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]] was a person who could work, but preferred not to. The law did not distinguish between the impotent poor and the criminal, so both received the same punishments. The law provided for "the putting out of children to be apprentices".

| [[Legitimacy (family law)|Bastard]]y
| In 1732, a woman pregnant with a "[[Legitimacy (family law)|bastard]]" was required to declare the fact and to name the father.
In 1733, the putative father became responsible for maintaining his illegitimate child; failing to do so could result in gaol. The parish would then support the mother and child, until the father agreed to do so, whereupon he would reimburse the parish — although this rarely happened.
In 1744, a bastard took the 'settlement' of its mother (under the [[Poor Law]], a person's place of origin or later established residence, being the parish responsible for the person if destitute) regardless of where the child was actually born. Previously, a bastard took [[Poor Relief Act 1662|settlement]] from its place of birth. The mother was to be publicly whipped.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham, P.

The prison population had risen after the US Declaration of Independence, because the American Colonies had been used as the destination for transported criminals. Howard's 1777 report had identified appalling conditions in most of the prisons he inspected. The [[Howard League for Penal Reform]] emerged as a result, publishing in 2006 the findings of an independent inquiry by Lord Carlile of Berriew QC into physical restraint, solitary confinement and forcible strip searching of [[children in prisons]], secure training centres and local authority secure children's homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howardleague.org/index.php?id=youngpeople Howard League for Penal Reform].&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Speenhamland system]]
| An amendment to the Poor Law, named after a meeting at the Pelican Inn in Speenhamland, Berkshire, where the local [[magistrates]] or ''[[squire]]archy'' devised the system as a means to alleviate hardship caused by a spike in grain prices. Families were paid extra to top up wages to a set level, which varied according to the number of children and the price of bread. For example, if bread was 1s 2d a loaf, the wages of a family with two children was topped up to 8s 6d. If bread rose to 1s 8d the wages were topped up to 11s 0d. The system aggravated the underlying causes of poverty, allowing employers (often farmers) to pay below subsistence wages, because the parish made up the difference to keep their workers alive. Low incomes remained unchanged and the poor rate contributors subsidised the farmers, so that landowners sought other means of dealing with the poor e.g. the [[workhouse]]. The Poor Law Commissioners' Report of 1834 called the Speenhamland System a "universal system of pauperism."

| [[Mettray Penal Colony]]
| In Mettray, north of the city of Tours, France a private reformatory, without walls, was opened by penal reformer Frédéric-Auguste Demetz in 1840 for the rehabilitation of young males aged between 6 and 21. At that time children and teenagers were routinely imprisoned with adults. Boys who were mostly deprived, disadvantaged or adandoned children, many of whom had committed only [[Summary offence]]s or [[petty crime]], were housed. Their heads were shaved, they wore uniforms, and up to age 12 spent most of the day studying arithmetic, writing and reading. Older boys had one hour of classes, with the rest of the day spent working. [[Reformatory Schools]] were modelled on Mettray, and the [[Borstal]] system, established in 1905, separated adolescents from adult prisoners. In the ''twentieth century'' Mettray became the focus for [[Michel Foucault]] because of its various systems and expressions of power and led Foucault to suggest that Mettray began the descent into modern penal theories and their inherent power structures.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel.

| [[Mary Carpenter]]'s research and lobbying contributed to the [[Youthful Offenders Act 1854]] and the [[Reformatory Schools (Scotland) Act 1854]]. These enabled voluntary schools to be certified as efficient by the Inspector of Prisons, and allowed courts to send them convicted juvenile offenders under 16 for a period of 2 to 5 years, instead of prison. Parents were required to contribute to the cost. Carpenter's 1851 publication ''Reformatory Schools for the Children of the Perishing and Dangerous Classes and for Juvenile Offenders'' was the first to coin the term 'Dangerous Classes' with respect to the lower classes, and the perceived propensity to criminality, of poor people.

In 1986 Professor Sir Leon Radzinowitz noted the practice of [[Economic conscription]], where, ‘there was a network of 208 schools: 43 reformatories, 132 industrial schools, 21 day industrial schools and 12 truant schools’ by the eve of the First World War, alongside a negligible education system for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Radzinowicz, Leon; Hood, Roger (1990).

| As portrayed in his Dominie book, A Dominie Abroad (Herbert Jenkins, 1923), A.S.Neill founded what would become known as Summerhill School in Hellerau, a suburb of Dresden. It was part of an International school called the Neue Schule. Neill moved his school to Sonntagsberg in Austria.

By 1923 Neill had moved to the town of Lyme Regis in the south of England, to a house called Summerhill where he began with 5 pupils. The school continued there until 1927, when it moved to the present site at Leiston in the county of Suffolk, taking the name of Summerhill with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.summerhillschool.co.uk/pages/history.html Summerhill School]. Retrieved 12 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child wrote in support of the school when it faced closure from Government inspectors, that it 'surpasses all expectations' in its implementation of children's rights, particularly Article 12.  Children's BBC made a four-part drama called Summerhill based on its fight for survival against the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008vryd#synopsis CBBC Summerhill drama].

The opening of the clinic created a major social impact on the 20th century, marking the start of a new era in fertility control by promising an opportunity for the modern world to break out of the [[Malthusian catastrophe|Malthusian Trap]]. A Eugenicist, Stopes' brand of [[Feminism]] sought selective breeding to achieve racial purity, sterilisation of those 'unfit for parenthood'.&lt;ref name="meller"/&gt;

| The [[Children and Young Persons Act 1932]] broadened the powers of juvenile courts in England and Wales and introduced supervision orders for children at risk. The [[Children and Young Persons Act 1933]] provided for [[young offender]]s, to be sent to an [[Approved School]], put on probation, or put into the care of a "fit person". Courts could, in addition, still sentence male juvenile offenders, as previously, to be "whipped with not more than six strokes of a birch rod by a constable". The Act also introduced Remand Homes for youths temporarily held in custody, to await a court hearing. The Home Office maintained a team of inspectors who visited each institution from time to time. Offenders, as well as receiving academic tuition, were assigned to work groups for such activities as building and bricklaying, metalwork, carpentry and gardening. Approved schools were known for strict discipline,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/courtlees.htm "The Court Lees Approved School Affair"], World Corporal Punishment Research.&lt;/ref&gt; and were essentially "open" institutions from which it was relatively easy to abscond. This allowed the authorities to claim that they were not "Reformatories", and set them apart from Borstal.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham, Peter.

The [[Defense of infancy|age of criminal responsibility]] was raised from 7 to 8, and no-one could be hanged for an offence committed under the age of 18. The Act consolidated most existing child protection legislation, enforcing strict punishments for anyone over 16 found to have neglected a child. Guidelines on the employment of school-age children were set, with a minimum age of 14 for full-time employment.

| The [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|Military Training Act]] sought to 'call up' boys from age 18 as 'militiamen', to distinguish them from the regular army. The intention was for conscripts to undergo six months basic training before being discharged into an active reserve, for subsequent recall to short training periods and an annual camp. Superseded by the [[National Service (Armed Forces) Act 1939]] enacted immediately by Parliament on 3 September 1939 - the date of declaration of war on Germany. Liability to full-time conscription was enforced on all males between 18 and 41. By 1942, all male British subjects resident in Great Britain aged 18–50 were liable to call-up, with only a few categories exempted, and female subjects aged 20–29.[[National Service (No 2) Act 1941]]

The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 gave new rights to police suspects and made the tape-recording of police interviews compulsory. The Phillips Commission, which reported in 1981, proposed a national prosecution service, one of whose aims would be to attempt to ensure that prosecution evidence was properly scrutinised, and that weak cases such as the one relating to the murder of Confait would not even reach the courts.

A child is defined as 16 years or younger. The ruling, which applies in England and Wales (but not in Scotland), is significant in that it is broader in scope than merely medical consent. It lays down that the authority of parents to make decisions for their minor children is not absolute, but diminishes with the child's evolving maturity; except in situations that are regulated otherwise by statute, the right to make a decision on any particular matter concerning the child shifts from the parent to the child when the child reaches sufficient maturity to be capable of making up his or her own mind on the matter requiring decision.

| The murder of two-year-old [[Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger]], by Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, both aged 10, prompted national debate about the relationship between [[Childhood]] and [[criminality]], which led to abolition in 1998 of the distinction with regard to [[Defense of infancy|criminal responsibility]] between young persons aged at least 14 and children aged between 10 and 14.

| [[UK Government]]
| Concerns about children in residential care led to the commissioning of 10 public enquiries between 1990 and 1996, including the Utting report (1991) and the [[Lord Warner|Warner]] report (1992), which exposed large-scale [[institutional abuse]] of children and young people. Sir William Utting CBE was Chief Inspector of Social Services during the period when the worst cases of abuse happened. Asked why safeguarding steps were not taken when he was directly responsible for overseeing Social Services, he replied: "...the crude answer to that question would be ignorance. There were tremendous pressures, I think, on everybody in the system at that time to deny that those of us working in the system and accepted by the community as being 'devoted to the interests of children' were in fact exploiting them and abusing them. So there was a period of ignorance and...denial and then the ...process of the revelation of these awful things that had gone on for a long time."&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmselect/cmhealth/319/31914.htm House of Commons - Health - Second Report&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

| 1998
| UK Government
| The [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]] abolished the distinction in England and Wales with regard to [[Defense of infancy|criminal responsibility]] between young persons aged at least 14 and children aged between 10 and 14. Hitherto, a child over 10 but under 14 was deemed in law to be ''doli incapax'', i.e. incapable of crime, unless the prosecution could satisfy the court that a particular child was in fact of such maturity, education and social development as to rebut that presumption. (Children under 10 in England and Wales remain ''doli incapax'', as they have been since the minimum age for criminal responsibility was raised from 8 to 10 under the [[Children and Young Persons Act 1963]]; power under the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 to raise the minimum age from 10 to 14 has never been implemented. In Scotland the minimum age remains at 8, but the presumption of ''doli incapax'' also remains). Describing Youth Courts as the 'secret garden' of the legal system, Home Secretary [[Jack Straw]] established the Youth Justice system, with [[Restorative Justice]] premised as the key underlying principle for resolving youth crime.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Amelia.

| In the trial of [[Sally Clark]] accused of murdering her two babies at age 11 weeks and 8 weeks, Meadow's testimony as [[expert witness]]  postulated [[Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy]], or MSbP, convinced that many apparent [[cot death]]s were in fact the result of [[child abuse]] brought on by MSbP. Clark's conviction was overturned in 2003, after 3 years of wrongful imprisonment. Throughout the 1990s Meadow had contributed to a number of convictions of (mostly) women whose children had suffered apparent cot deaths and a greater number of parents, whom Meadow suspected of MSbP, had their children forcibly removed and taken into care. Meadow was struck off the medical register, but reinstated in 2006 after an appeal. The Society of Expert Witnesses had commented that the severity of his punishment would cause many professionals to reconsider whether to stand as expert witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Boseley, Sarah.

| Defended by the international human rights barrister, Sir Geoffrey Robertson QC, after three days at the Royal Courts of Justice, Summerhill won its right to continue to be based on children's rights. The DfES accepted its demands, expressed in a joint agreement. The agreement was voted on by the children from the school in the court room. This agreement accepted the right of children at Summerhill to control their own learning, and has been used by Home Educators as part of their legal fights with the government. Summerhill is now the most legally protected school in the country with a unique inspection process that is the first to include the voices of children, preceding the newly announced OFSTED plans to take account of students' views.

[[File:Young Toposa man.jpg|thumb|Young Toposa man]]
The '''Toposa''' are an ethnic group in [[South Sudan]], living in the [[Greater Kapoeta]] region of the erstwhile [[Eastern Equatoria]] [[States of South Sudan|state]].
They have traditionally lived by herding cattle, sheep and goats, and in the past were involved in the [[ivory trade]]. They have a tradition of constant low-level warfare, usually cattle raids, against their neighbors.

During the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983–2005) the Toposa helped the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] (SPLA) at times, and at other times helped the Government of [[Sudan]]. After the war, sporadic clashes with neighboring tribes continued. The Toposa way of life is slowly being modernized and traditional social organization is eroding.

==Location==
[[File:Eastern Equatoria map.svg|thumb|300px|Eastern Equatoria State – Greater Kapoeta to the east]]
The Toposa people live in [[Greater Kapoeta]], beside the [[Singaita River|Singaita]] and Lokalyen rivers, and have a ritual center at [[Loyooro River]]. For seasonal grazing they migrate to Moruangipi and sometimes east into the [[Ilemi Triangle]].{{sfn|Toposa A Language – Ethnologue}}
Toposa people also live in the southeast of [[Jonglei]] State.{{sfn|Small Arms Survey 2007|pp=337}}
Their main settlements include [[Kapoeta]], [[Riwoto]] and [[Narus, South Sudan|Narus]].
The land is semi-arid and rugged, with hills and ridges separated by shallow plains and seasonal streams. 
Vegetation is limited to shrubs and short grass.{{sfn|Toposa – Gurtong}}

The Toposa mainly rely on cattle, sheep and goats, from which they obtain milk, blood, meat and leather.
During the wet season the animals graze near the villages. When the rains end, the men take the herds to dry season pasturage then slowly bring them back, grazing along the way, to arrive in the village when the next rainy season starts. Some areas of good pasturage cannot be used because of lack of drinking water.{{sfn|Yongo-Bure|2007|pp=22}}

The women also engage in limited agriculture in the river valleys.{{sfn|Springwood|2007|pp=80}} The main crop is [[sorghum]], grown on fertile clay soils. Depending on conditions there may be severe shortages or large surpluses. The Toposa country has low, unpredictable rainfall. The streams are torrential, flowing only in the rainy season. {{sfn|Yongo-Bure|2007|pp=22}}

==Culture==
[[File:Toposa village.jpg|thumb|300px|A Toposa village]]
The [[Toposa language]] is a [[Nilotic language]]. 
It belongs to the Turkana group, which also includes [[Karamojong language|Karamojong]] of Uganda, [[Nyangatom language|Nyangatom]] of Ethiopia and [[Turkana language|Turkana]] of Kenya.{{sfn|Nilo-Saharan}}
The Turkana and Toposa languages are so close that they are mutually intelligible.{{sfn|König|2008|pp=144}}
Other names for the Toposa language are Akara, Kare, Kumi, Taposa and Topotha.{{sfn|Toposa A Language – Ethnologue}}

The Toposa economy and social life revolves around herding livestock, including cattle, camels, donkeys, goats and sheep. The Toposa also pan for gold and other precious minerals in the stream beds.
Boys are first given care of goats and sheep, then graduate to looking after cattle when they come of age.
They may travel considerable distances seeking water and pasturage.{{sfn|Toposa – Gurtong}}
Possession of cattle, along with possession of a loaded gun, are the main measures of status and wealth. Cattle are central to Toposa culture.{{sfn|Springwood|2007|pp=80}}
The Toposa have always competed for water and pasturage with their neighbors, and have always engaged in cattle rustling.{{sfn|Toposa – Gurtong}}
The traditional Toposa weapon was a long throwing spear, used in raids in conjunction with a shield. The attacker would run forward zigzagging to dodge missiles, hurl his spear and then retreat, ready to ambush a pursuing enemy.{{sfn|Springwood|2007|pp=80}}

The Toposa share the habit of constant low-level warfare, mainly to capture cattle, with their neighbors. According to P.H. Gulliver, writing in 1952, "[[Turkana people|Turkana]] made war on all their neighbours with the exception of the [[Jie (Uganda)|Jie]], with whom they occasionally allied themselves against the [[Karamajong people|Karamajong]] and the [[Dodoth people|Dodoth]]. Karamajong similarly made war on all their neighbors with the exception of the Dudoth, with whom they occasionally allied themselves against the Jie. Jie claim friendship with the Toposa, but since they have no common boundaries this would have been of little importance. Toposa and [[Donyiro people|Donyiro]] did not fight each other, and are known to have formed an alliance against the Turkana. Toposa and [[Jiye people|Jiye]] were enemies".{{sfn|Mukherjee|1985|pp=79–80}}

Women are expected to remain at home farming, cooking, raising children and caring for the elderly.{{sfn|Toposa – Gurtong}}
This division of labour can be inefficient. When an NGO introduced ox cultivation, at first they decided it would be easier to have men undertake the ploughing, although cultivation was women's work, than to have women intrude into the men's world of animal husbandry. Later they decided that women should be allowed to plough, but councils of elders rejected the notion. However, Toposa elders have limited power and the NGO went ahead and trained some women in ox ploughing, mostly widows and orphans. The experiment ended in 1985 when rebel forces arrived in the area, a disaster the elders naturally attributed to letting women manage cattle.{{sfn|Giri|2003|pp=209}}

[[File:Toposa Elder.jpg|thumb|left|Toposa Elder]]
There is no clear political organization among the Toposa, although respect is paid to elders, chiefs and wise men.
Most decisions about the clan or community are made in meetings attended only by the men, traditionally held in the dark hours before the dawn.{{sfn|Toposa – Gurtong}}
Matters of war and peace are decided by the sections councils of the elders, and the elders have sacral power over rain and drought.{{sfn|Simonse|1992|pp=49}}
Captain King, a soldier of the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium who conquered the Toposa and ruled them for sixteen years, wrote: "There seems no doubt that prior to the advent of the Abyssinians even the idea of 'the Chief' was entirely unknown to the Topotha; the affairs of section and nation were regulated by the leaders of the ruling class, next but one above the warrior class... Gifted individuals such as Tuliabong or Lotukol, himself an elder, might by their force of character or prowess come to exercise unusual sway; but this was purely personal and there was no concept of it passing on his death to his son".{{sfn|Simonse|1992|pp=47}}

The Toposa believe in a supreme being and in ancestral spirits, who may assist in overcoming problems such as drought or epidemics of disease among their herds.{{sfn|Toposa – Gurtong}}
They believe that men originally lived with "Nakwuge" in the sky, but many slid down a rope to earth. The rope then broke, separating them from heaven.{{sfn|Knighton|2005|pp=233}}
As of 2000, perhaps 5% of the population could read.{{sfn|Toposa A Language – Ethnologue}}
The Toposa culture is orally transmitted through songs, dance, music, poems and folklore.
The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Torit]] has been actively proselytizing among the Toposa, with some success.{{sfn|Toposa – Gurtong}}

==Early history==

The Toposa belong to what has been called the "Karamojong cluster", which includes the [[Karamojong people]] of Uganda, the [[Dongiro people]] and [[Jiye people]] in south eastern South Sudan and south western Ethiopia, and the [[Turkana people]] of Kenya.{{sfn|Knighton|2005|pp=23}}
The Toposa say that they originated in the [[Losolia Mountains]] in Uganda, moving away during a severe drought that killed both people and animals.{{sfn|Toposa – Gurtong}}
A mortal quarrel between the Lwo and Tap (ancestors of the Taposa) people was thought to have upset the harmony of all life in northern Uganda, causing a great famine in 1587–1623. People were forced to move away for great distances, and those who remained were reduced to cannibalism.{{sfn|Knighton|2005|pp=58}}
After leaving the heartland of the original group the ancestors of the Toposa settled at [[Losilang]] for a while, then drifted north in search of grazing. At [[Loyoro, South Sudan|Loyoro]] one group, the Nyangatom or Dongiro, went east, while the Mosingo and Kor sections of the Toposa, under pressure from the Turkana, moved west and had settled in Kapoeta by 1830.{{sfn|Knighton|2005|pp=63}}

The [[Lotuho people|Lotuho]] have a tradition that their glorious kingdom of Imatari was destroyed by the Toposa some time around the start of the nineteenth century. An exiled king of the Lotuho had taken refuge in Toposaland, alone apart from his dog. He returned with a band of Toposa who encircled the city. When the people took refuge in the king's palace, which had strong walls, the Toposa pushed over the walls. After the battle the Lotuhu dispersed to villages in their current territory.{{sfn|Simonse|1992|pp=175}}

[[File:Toposa Children South Sudan 009.jpg|thumb|300px|Toposa children]]
The Toposa became involved in the ivory trade in the late 19th and early 20th century.
When [[Muhammad Ahmad]] established the Mahdiyya in 1881 the effect was to almost stop trade in ivory through Sudan to the north. Instead, exports began flowing through Ethiopia.{{sfn|Donham|James|1986|pp=207}}
As the British established a presence in Sudan and East Africa in the 1890s, they imposed regulations preventing export through their territory of immature or female ivory. In response, the Toposa turned increasingly to [[Maji, Ethiopia|Maji]] in Ethiopia as a market for their ivory.{{sfn|Donham|James|1986|pp=209}}
Before World War I, Ethiopian influence stretched westward to the [[Kidepo River]] and beyond, and the ivory trade in this area was unaffected before 1927.{{sfn|Molloy|1950}}

The Toposa developed close relations with Swahili traders, and intermarriage was common.
The Toposa language became a ''lingua franca'' to the west of [[Lake Rudolf]] and throughout most of Eastern Equatoria. The trade route between [[Mbale]] in what is now Uganda and Maji ran through Toposa territory, not because it was the shortest route, but because it had dependable year-round water and donkeys could be readily obtained to carry ivory.{{sfn|Donham|James|1986|pp=214}}
Another route ran from Maji by way of Obawok, North [[Lafit]], [[Lafon County|Lafon]] and the [[Badigeru swamp]] to the [[White Nile|Nile]].{{sfn|Molloy|1950}}
The ivory trade brought arms and ammunition from Ethiopia into Toposa territory, and these were used in joint cattle raids with the Swahili on neighbouring people.{{sfn|Donham|James|1986|pp=214}}

The government of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]] "pacified" the Toposa territory in 1926/1927. Around the same time, the [[British East Africa]]n government established posts in northern [[Turkanaland]] to the south.{{sfn|Donham|James|1986|pp=211}} 
With steadily tightening restrictions, by the early 1930s the Toposa were the main remaining traders in ivory in the southern Sudanese lowlands.{{sfn|Donham|James|1986|pp=206}}
The Toposa country remained part of [[Sudan]] when that country became independent in 1956.
The [[First Sudanese Civil War]], which lasted from 1955 until 1972, had some impact on the Toposa.
The [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], breaking out in 1983, had a massive impact.

==Civil war==
[[File:Toposa woman with tank.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A Toposa woman with an armored vehicle in the background]]
During the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983–2005) the Toposa helped the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] (SPLA) at times, and at other times helped the Government of Sudan.
The Toposa took a pragmatic approach, ostensibly siding with whoever gave them the most food and weapons.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|pp=86}}
The SPLA alternated between violence and a more conciliatory approach to the Toposa. In 1985–1986 the SPLA attacked the civilian population of the Toposa, which it deemed "hostile". From 1987 the SPLA began an attempt to improve relations with the civilians.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|pp=83}} By 1988 some of the SPLA fighters were Toposa.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|pp=86}}

The [[Sudan Armed Forces]] sought to exploit traditional tensions between the Toposa and the [[Dinka people]], to whom many of the SPLA leaders belonged, by supplying arms and ammunition to the Toposa.{{sfn|Small Arms Survey 2007|pp=337}}
The firearms were used both to protect and increase wealth in animals, and became a symbol of wealth in themselves. During the 1990s the government of Sudan issued at least 50,000 small arms to the Toposa.{{sfn|Springwood|2007|pp=80}}
In 1992 an [[AK-47]] supplied by the government could be traded for ten cows, or the SPLA would provide [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3|G3]] rifles in exchange for the AK-47s.{{sfn|Peterson|2001|pp=207}}
Raids by the now well-armed Toposa on their neighbors, such as the [[Suri people]] of Ethiopia, increased drastically.{{sfn|Schlee|Watson|2009|pp=42}}
[[Internally Displaced People]] (IDPs) moving through Toposa territory were subject to harassment by Toposa militia or bandits.{{sfn|SUDAN THE LOST BOYS}}

[[Kapoeta]], a town in Toposa country, had been captured by the SPLA on 25 February 1988.
The government armed the Toposa so they could fight the SPLA and also fight their traditional rivals the [[Lotuko people]].{{sfn|Rone|Prendergast|Sorensen|1994|pp=45}}
In March 1992, Toposa militia staged attacks on relief columns attempting to bring supplies into [[Kapoeta]].{{sfn|Rone|Prendergast|Sorensen|1994|pp=37}}
Refugees escaping from [[Pochalla]], which had fallen to the Sudanese government, were attacked by Toposa militia as they made their way to Kapoeta.{{sfn|Rone|Prendergast|Sorensen|1994|pp=38}}
On 28 May 1992, the government regained Kapoeta in a surprise attack. The Toposa militia, with their knowledge of the terrain, played a central role.{{sfn|Rone|Prendergast|Sorensen|1994|pp=45}}
The evacuated civilians from Kapeota moved south to Narus, and from there over 20,000 went on to [[Lokichokio]] in Kenya, including 12,500 unaccompanied minors.{{sfn|Rone|Prendergast|Sorensen|1994|pp=45}}

According to Amnesty International, the SPLA started a policy of "deliberate and arbitrary killing of civilians of Toposa ethnicity around Kapoeta ... in retaliation for the involvement of Toposa pro-government militia in the capture of Kapoeta and subsequent attacks on refugees fleeing the town".{{sfn|Rone|Prendergast|Sorensen|1994|pp=224}}
By the late 1990s, serious efforts were being made to reduce ethnic tensions.
The Inter-African Bureau for Animal Resources sponsored harmonization workshops and meetings to resolve and prevent conflicts among pastoralist communities such as the Toposa and their neighbors.
The participants in a [[Didinga people|Didinga]]-Turkana-Toposa-[[Nyangatom people|Nyangatom]] women's workshop in February 2000 undertook responsibility for discouraging further livestock rustling and raiding between the communities.{{sfn|Mwaûra|Schmeidl|2002|pp=155}}
The role of women, willing to cross the boundaries and unilaterally initiate peace talks, is without precedent and has been crucial.{{sfn|Small Arms Survey 2007|pp=338}} 
The Catholic Diocese of Torit was active in resolving conflicts among the Toposa, and conflicts between the Toposa, [[Didinga people|Didinga]] and [[Boya people|Boya]], and the Toposa Development Authority had been established to promote development and peacebuilding among the Toposa.{{sfn|Mwaûra|Schmeidl|2002|pp=156}}

==Recent events==
[[File:Toposa mother and child.jpg|thumb|Toposa mother and child]]
[[File:Young Toposa Man South Sudan 011.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Young man]]
There has been a long history of conflict between the Toposa of Namorunyang and the [[Didinga people|Didinga]] of [[Budi County]]. In the dry season the Toposa would drive their cattle to the [[Didinga Hills]] for water and pasture until the rains began in Toposa land. In the past, this practice was carried out by agreement between the two communities, with a gift being made in exchange for the right to access the pasturage. With the proliferation of guns and breakdown of order during the civil war, the traditional protocols were ignored and violence became common.{{sfn|Cross Border Peace}}
In May 2007 Toposa tribesmen of Namorunyang raided the Ngauro ''Payam'' of [[Budi County]], attacked a group that were resting after working in a collectively-owned field, and took 300 head of cattle and 400 goats or sheep.{{sfn|Report of Security}}
49 women, 4 children and 5 men were killed, while others were wounded.{{sfn|Open Letter – Gurtong}}

[[Nadapal]], just across the border in [[Kenya]], is a fertile area in which many Toposa took refuge during the civil war.
With the end of the conflict, some Kenyans wanted the Toposa of the Nadapal area to return to South Sudan. The Toposa resisted, perhaps in part because they felt that tribes such as the [[Dinka people|Dinka]] and [[Nuer people|Nuer]] resented the Toposa backing of the Government of Sudan during the civil war, and they would therefore be treated as an unwelcome minority in [[Eastern Equatoria]].{{sfn|Kenya: Never ending war}}
There were ongoing clashes between the Toposa and Turkana in this area.
A May 2010 report said the fighting between Toposa and Turkana had claimed over 40 lives and about 4,000 livestock had been stolen.It also said that [[George Echom]], Deputy Governor of Eastern Equatorial State, had claimed that Nadapal belonged to South Sudan.{{sfn|Lucheli|2010}}

A 1982 report said there were 105,000 speakers of the Toposa language, including 95,000 along both sides of the Zingietta and Lokalyen rivers, and 10,000 in Ethiopia.{{sfn|Bright|1992|pp=107}}
More recent reports give a much higher population.{{sfn|Toposa – Gurtong}}
In recent times, improvements have been made in health care, water supply and veterinary services. 
Many of the Toposa children now attend school in Narus and [[Natinga]]. These changes are profoundly affecting the traditional social organization.{{sfn|Toposa – Gurtong}}
Women are starting to take a more prominent role in resolving disputes.{{sfn|USAID/OTI Sudan}}
The Governor of Eastern Equatoria, who took office in May 2010, is former Brigadier General [[Louis Lobong Lojore]]. He is a Toposa from Kapoeta East County.{{sfn|Eastern Equatoria – UN}}

'''Ultranationalism''' is an "extreme [[nationalism]] that promotes the interest of one state or people above all others", or simply "extreme devotion to one's own nation".&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/ultranationalism Ultranationalism]. Oxford English Dictionary. Retrieved 29 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/ultranationalism Ultranationalism]. Collins English Dictionary. Retrieved 29 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ultranationalism combined with the notion of national rebirth is a key foundation of [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin, "Nationalism" in  Cyprian Blamires, ed., ''World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia'', vol. 2 (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2006), pp. 451–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Janusz Bugajski]], "in its most extreme or developed forms, ultra-nationalism resembles fascism, marked by a xenophobic disdain of other nations, support for [[authoritarian]] political arrangements verging on [[totalitarianism]], and a mythical emphasis on the "organic unity" between a charismatic leader, an organizationally amorphous movement-type party, and the nation".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xeFNV40_EUAC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=ultranationalism+authoritarian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi20tfP0rnaAhWLOsAKHQhhB7wQ6AEIWDAI#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Politics of National Minority Participation in Post-communist Europe'']. ''EastWest Institute''. p.65. Section author - Janusz Bugajski. Book edited by Johnathan P.Stein. Published by M.E. Sharpe. Published in New York in 2000. Retrieved via Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Griffin]] asserts that ultranationalism is essentially [[Racism|racist]] and is known to legitimise itself "through deeply mythicized narratives of past cultural or political periods of historical greatness or of old scores to settle against alleged enemies". It can also draw on "vulgarized forms of physical anthropology, genetics and [[eugenics]] to rationalize ideas of national superiority and destiny, of degeneracy and subhumanness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World fascism: a historical encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDYRAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22%22through+deeply+mythicized+narratives+of+past+cultural+or+political+periods%22&amp;dq=%22%22through+deeply+mythicized+narratives+of+past+cultural+or+political+periods%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLpMWk1efZAhWF7lMKHSJqCZoQ6AEIKTAA|year=2006|page=452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Unrecognized Bedouin village.jpg|thumb|General view of one of the Unrecognized [[Bedouin]] villages in the [[Negev Desert]] of [[Israel]], January 2008]]
'''Unrecognized Bedouin villages in Israel''' are rural [[Israeli Bedouins|Bedouin]] communities in the [[Negev]] and the [[Galilee]] which the [[Israeli government]] does not recognize as legal. Often they are referred to as "unrecognized villages".

==General data==

===Number of the villages===
The exact number of unrecognized villages is unknown. Different bodies use different definitions of the term "village". As a result, numbers offered by them differ, but there is an increase in the last decade, in spite of a slow recognition process of some of these communities.

According to Maha Qupty, representing the Bedouin advocacy organization RCUV, in 2004 there were 45 unrecognized Bedouin villages in the Negev.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hic-net.org/document.php?pid=2670 |title=Bedouin Unrecognized Villages of the Negev |access-date=15 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308045459/http://www.hic-net.org/document.php?pid=2670 |archive-date=8 March 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Human Rights Watch]] report based upon the 2006 statistics offered by the [[Adva Center]],&lt;ref name= "Swirski"&gt;Shlomo Swirski and Yael Hasson, "[http://www.adva.org/uploaded/NegevEnglishSummary.pdf Invisible Citizens: Israeli Government Policy Toward the Negev Bedouin]", "Adva Center – Information on Equality and Social Justice in Israel", February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; approximately half of Bedouin citizens of Israel (85,000 out of 170,000) live in 39 such villages.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/node/62284/section/4|title=Off the Map|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another Bedouin advocacy organization The Association of Forty, in 2013 there were about 92 unrecognized villages in Israel, 59 of them were Bedouin villages in the Negev.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

According to the head of the Bedouin Administration, [[Ya'akov Katz (politician born 1951)|Yaakov Katz]], and geographer [[Arnon Soffer]], in the Negev area alone, there were about 1000 illegal Bedouin concentrations with over 64,000 homes in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;Prof.Arnon Soffer, [http://web.hevra.haifa.ac.il/~ch-strategy/index.php?page=news&amp;id=51 Government resolution regarding the Bedouin dating January 27, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sof-a"&gt;Arnon Soffer, [http://www.inn.co.il/News/News.aspx/217597 Bedouin coming to Tel Aviv], [[Arutz Sheva|Channel 7]], 29 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; with about 2200-2000 new buildings adding every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iba.org.il/ibadoc/?entity=746241&amp;type=1&amp;topic=167|title=IBADOC - The IBA Channel 1 Documentaries Dept :: הערוץ הראשון מחלקת תעודה - מבט שני - "מדינת נודדים"|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, in 2008 the [[Goldberg Commission]] stated that there were 50,000 illegal buildings in the Negev, and about 1,500 to 2,000 more were built every year.&lt;ref&gt;Aviad Glickman, [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3637006,00.html Report: State should recognize Bedouin villages], [[Ynetnews]], 11 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Testifying before the Goldberg Committee in 2010, Israeli right-wing NGO [[Regavim (NGO)|Regavim]] reported 2,100 separate concentrations in Negev of 3–400 constructions each, covering over 800,000 [[dunam]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ari Briggs, [http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Tower-and-Stockade-settlements-Version-20 Tower and Stockade settlements – Version 2.0], [[Jerusalem Post]] op-ed, 5 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pitron"&gt;[http://www.regavim.org.il/images/files/yeshpitaron_ivrit.pdf The Regavim movement has a solution], Regavim, 1 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size of the area===
According to the [[Israel Land Administration]], Negev Bedouin claim area 12 times bigger than that of Tel Aviv.&lt;ref name="MMI" /&gt;

According to Prof. Sofer, the Bedouin make up about 2% of the [[Population of Israel|Israeli population]], but the unrecognized Bedouin communities spread on a vast territory and occupy more than 10 percent of Israel – north and east to [[Be'er Sheva]]. According to him, the Negev Bedouin also started to settle west of Be'er Sheva and close to [[Mount Hebron]]. Their communities spread south to [[Dimona]] and towards the [[Judean Desert]]. They occupy large spaces near [[Retamim]] and [[Revivim]] and get close to the [[Gaza Strip]], occupy land in the central Negev near [[Mitzpe Ramon]], and even close to the central area. In 2010 alone about 66 illegal Bedouin settlements were established in the area of [[Rehovot]] and [[Rishon LeZion]].&lt;ref name="shfela"&gt;Regev Goldman, [http://www.nrg.co.il/online/54/ART2/133/497.html Lowland Bedouin invaders?

[[Makor Rishon]], 15 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iba"&gt;Prof. Arnon Sofer, [http://web.hevra.haifa.ac.il/~ch-strategy/images/publications/goldberg_commission.pdf Following the Goldberg Committee. Did Israel lose the northern Negev], Chaikin Geostrategy, March 2009, [[University of Haifa]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Arnon Sofer, the illegal Bedouin expansion continues rapidly in all directions and occupies spaces that Israel did not know before.&lt;ref name="shomer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hene"&gt;Uri Hudi, [http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000707072 Arnon Sofer: Bedouin Arab communities and strangle the country], 15 December 2011, Globes&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number of residents===
Between 1994 and 2007, Israel recognized 21 Arab townships with a similar illegal status until then. In the Galilee, most of the illegal villages were regulated and recognized, and from a population of 90,000 Bedouin in the north, a few hundred still live in unrecognized villages.&lt;ref name="shomer"&gt;Prof. Arnon Sofer, [http://www.shomer-israel.org/images/stories/doc/arnon1.pdf Because of lack of governance the new guard is born], March 2011, On new guard&lt;/ref&gt; In the south, it is estimated that about 90,000 residents live in unrecognized Bedouin villages; these Bedouin comprise 45% of the total Bedouin population.&lt;ref&gt;According to a survey of Association of Forty&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status===
The unrecognized villages were built without official permission (this is why they are not recognized by the state) and thus remain ineligible for municipal services, such as connection to the electrical grid, water mains or trash-pickup, and they cannot elect government representatives. They are scattered all over the Northern Negev and often are situated adjacent to military fire zones, [[natural reserve]]s, [[landfill]]s, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manski|first=Rebecca|title=A Desert Mirage: The Rising Role of US Money in Negev Development|journal=News From Within|date=October–November 2006|volume= XXII| issue =  8|url=http://www.alternativenews.org/english/index.php/component/content/article/100-special-project/news-from-within/749-news-from-within-vol-xxii-no-8-october-november-2006-749|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the unrecognized Bedouin village of [[Wadi al-Na'am]] is surrounded by an IDF munitions factory and military fire zone, the Efrat Oil Terminal – an oil-storage site, the [[Israel Electric Corporation]] and [[Mekorot]] – the national water carrier site.&lt;ref name="Am"&gt;Am Johal, [http://www.caiaweb.org/old-site/files/johal-negev.pdf "Powerless" Bedouin Village Still Seeking Health Care]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by the Israeli NGO Adva Center, "The [[Negev Bedouin|Bedouin]] living in the Negev constitute the only group of Arab citizens of Israel that still has a large-scale hold on the land, a hold that the state officially denies in principle, while recognizing in practice."&lt;ref name="Swirski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt;

According to the [[Israel Land Administration]] (2007), some 60 per cent of the Negev Bedouin lived in seven permanent state-planned townships, such as [[Rahat]], [[Tel as-Sabi]], [[Shaqib al-Salam]] (Segev Shalom), [[Ar'arat an-Naqab]], [[Kuseife]], [[Lakiya]] and [[Hura]], while the rest (40 per cent) – "in illegal homes spread over hundreds of thousands of dunams".&lt;ref name="MMI"&gt;[http://www.mmi.gov.il/static/HanhalaPirsumim/Beduin_information.pdf Bedouin information], ILA, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003 a number of previously illegal Bedouin communities were recognized by the state (such as [[Al-Sayyid, Israel|al-Sayyid]]), and several new ones were built (such as [[Tirabin al-Sana]]) totaling 12 (not including the previous seven townships).&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Golan, [http://b1.jpost.com/JerusalemReport/Israel/Article.aspx?id=275259 Built on sand], Jerusalem Report, 26 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; They were united under [[Abu Basma Regional Council]] that was split on 5 November 2012 into two newly created bodies: [[Neve Midbar Regional Council]] and [[al-Kasom Regional Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abubasma.org.il/index.php?m=ar&amp;artd=6282 Information for the citizens] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821123651/http://abubasma.org.il/index.php?m=ar&amp;artd=6282 |date=21 August 2013 }}, Abu Basma Regional Council official site (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2013, there are no updated official statistics on the number of Bedouin living outside the government-[[Planned community|planned]] and officially recognized communities.

==History==
{{Main|Negev Bedouin}}

===The Ottoman empire===
During the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, the semi-arid region of the Negev was inhabited mostly by [[semi-nomadic]] Bedouin tribes.&lt;ref name="manski1"&gt;Rebecca Manski, [Criminalizing Self-Subsistence], ''News from Within", Summer 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1858 the Turks enacted [[Tanzimat|a law]] stating that all landowners names must be officially documented as a means of regulating matters relating to land in the Ottoman Empire. Most of the land in the Negev was classified as muwat (dead land, wasteland unsuitable for cultivation).

The Bedouin did not create a written record of their connection to the land, and some argue that even opposed to it, since it would make them subject to the [[Ottoman empire]], what would require them to pay taxes and serve in the Ottoman army. Also, when the publication of the [[Ottoman Land Code of 1858|Ottoman Lands Ordinance]], the Negev area had no permanent settlement.

By the year 1896 Negev Bedouin lived in almost complete freedom. The Ottomans were not interested and did not intervene in the Negev and the Bedouins. According to Yosef Ben-Dor, only after a tribal war, the Turkish government marked tribal boundaries, but did not give the Bedouins in this agreement "ownership" of tribal territorial lands.&lt;ref name="Goldberg"&gt;[http://www.landpedia.org/landdoc/Analytical_materials/Goldberg_recommendations-english.pdf Goldberg Commission's recommendations], RCUV, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Mandate===
The British government adopted the Ottoman land laws, and added to them the Land Ordinance, intended to prevent squatting and recognition of unauthorized takeover of land.

In 1921, the government of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] issued an order for all the Negev residents to register their land. According to the Land Ordinance of 1921, any Bedouin who cultivated and improved a "mewat" (dead) land received a confirmation of ownership on that same land. Although the Bedouin were granted with a special extension of two-month to register their land, they have never done so, and the land remained unregistered.&lt;ref Name="bendavid"&gt;Joseph son of David. [Bust Negev Bedouin, Jews, land, fresh: Center for Arab society in Israel], 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandate authorities also conducted a preliminary registration of land and since 1934 began to collect land taxes. Mandatory maps show the location of the Bedouin tribes, however, the maps never marked the boundaries of each tribe.

The 1947 report of the [[United Nations Special Committee on Palestine]] estimated the number of bedouins in the Beersheba district to be about 90,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/07175de9fa2de563852568d3006e10f3 UNSCOP Report, Vol II.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610173759/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/07175DE9FA2DE563852568D3006E10F3 |date=10 June 2012 }}, Chapter 2, Para. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for a 1946 census of Palestine that was never carried out, the British government surveyed all the tribes ''in situ'' and concluded that the number of bedouin in the Beersheba district was about 92,000 out of 127,000 in the whole country.&lt;ref name=AAC1432/&gt;  It also reported that they cultivated about two million dunums of cereal land and that aerial photographs of the northern Beersheva taken by the Royal Air Force revealed the existence of 3,389 houses and 8,722 tents."&lt;ref name=AAC1432&gt;Ad Hoc Committee on the Palestine Question, Report of Sub-committee 2, November 11, 1947, [http://domino.un.org/pdfs/AAC1432.pdf UN Doc A/AC.14/32], pages 40 and 65.&lt;/ref&gt;  The same figure of two million dunams appeared in a 1944/5 book of [[Yosef Weitz]], but in contrast "Shimoni and Tartakover estimate the area cultivated by Bedouin in the Negev at only 60,000 dunam."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landpedia.org/landdoc/Analytical_materials/Goldberg_recommendations-english.pdf Goldberg Committee recommendations], quoting a 1982 paper of Aharon Zohar.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sasson Bar Zvi, a cultural researcher of the Negev Bedouin, and Arie Efrat who served as director for the Arab villages in the south, the lack of water in the Negev area did not allow its residents to revive the land and therefore they preferred nomadic life and shepherding to an organized and rental land cultivation, and this is why the land remained a desolate area.&lt;ref name="psak"&gt;[http://weblaw.haifa.ac.il/he/Faculty/Kedar/lecdb/bedouins/387.doc Salim Ali Agdia to Hawashla and others vs. State of Israel], Civil Appeal No. 218\74]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Bedouin, although they did not document land ownership, the Turkish government and the British recognized the rights of ownership of land in which they roamed, and this recognition was expressed when the Bedouins sold land to the Zionist movement during the British Mandate, and the sales were recognized and recorded in the [[Tapu (Ottoman law)|land registry (Tabu)]]. In contrast, Dr. Yosef Ben-David explains this fact by claiming that the Ottoman and British authorities saw a blessing in transferring land from the Bedouin to the applicant for registration, because they will be likely to use land intensively, without the authorities taking into consideration any legal rights the Bedouins had to the land recognized by either government.&lt;ref name = "bendavid "/&gt;

Furthermore, Jews who dealt with redemption of lands in the establishment of Israel gave [[ex gratia]] funds to the Bedouin to enable the rapid registration of Israel lands in the land registry, and not because legal recognition of ownership of the Bedouin on the land. Since the beginning of the 1930s and until the establishment of the State of Israel, the Bedouin sold almost 765,000 dunams of land, of which about 180,000 sold to [[JNF]] representatives and about 45,000 dunams to private Jews. The rest 545,000 dunams, were sold mainly to Arab peasants from the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref name="jes"&gt;Daniel Center for Strategic Dialogue, [http://www.fnst-jerusalem.org/beduim.pdf Negev Bedouin strategic challenge to Israel], [[Netanya Academic College]], January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
[[Image:Greenwashing - the old way of life, trashed.JPG|thumb|180px|Goats grazing beneath garbage bins in [[Tel Sheva]]]]
During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the Negev region saw harsh battles between the newly created [[Israel Defense Forces]] and the [[Egyptian army]]. In the aftermath of the war, most of the Negev was included within the borders of the newly established [[State of Israel]]. Censuses before and after the war indicate that about 80% of the Bedouin population left the Negev to areas that remained under Arab rule.&lt;ref name=goldberg&gt;[http://www.moch.gov.il/SiteCollectionDocuments/odot/doch_goldberg/Doch_Vaada_Shofet_Goldberg.pdf Report of the Commission to Propose a Policy for Arranging Bedouin Settlement in the Negev], a.k.a. the Goldberg Report, pp. 6–13 (Hebrew version)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli authorities' treatment of the Bedouin population was ambivalent. On the one hand, the Bedouin were considered loyal to the new state, and some of them even volunteered to serve in the IDF. On the other hand, Israel saw the Negev as its "[[hinterland]]", being sparsely populated and as the [[West Bank]] came under Jordanian rule. The policy eventually adopted was forcing the Bedouin to concentrate in an area of 1,100&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, that has become known as the ''Siyagh'' (Arabic for "the permitted area") region, stretching between the West Bank border to the north-east, [[Be'er Sheva]] to the south-west and Arad to the south. All the Bedouin remaining under Israeli rule were granted Israeli citizenship, but the ''Siyagh'' region was placed under martial law until 1966, like many other mostly Arab-populated areas in Israel at the time.&lt;ref name=goldberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fridman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localeconomyseminar.net/?p=88|author=Dor Fridman|title=About the Negev Bedouins|publisher=LocalEconomySeminar|access-date=21 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705070215/http://www.localeconomyseminar.net/?p=88|archive-date=5 July 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the time when most of the unrecognized villages of today were established.{{clarify|date=December 2013}}

The Bedouin claims for ownership on lands in the Negev were, by and large, rejected by the Israeli authorities, on the pretext that the ownership is not appropriately [[Tapu (Ottoman law)|documented]] or that the lands claimed are not eligible to [[Private ownership of land|private ownership]]. Both Bedouin citizens and state authorities agree that only a small minority of the claim can be backed with full legally valid documentation, however the Bedouin claimants demand that their traditional ties with the lands, namely the fact that they de facto held the rights on these lands without objection on behalf of the former Ottoman or British authorities, be recognized by the State of Israel as ownership.

Implementing her land policies, Israel started to rely on the [[Ottoman Land Code of 1858]], the only preceding law frame in the region. According to these regulations, lands that were not registered as of private ownership, were considered state lands. Israel relied mainly on [[Tapu (Ottoman law)|Tabu]] recordings. Most of the Bedouin land fell under the Ottoman class of 'non-workable' (mawat) land and thus belonged to the state under Ottoman law. Eventually, Israel nationalized most of the Negev lands, using The Land Rights Settlement Ordinance from 1969.&lt;ref name="Fridman"/&gt;&lt;ref name = Kurt&gt;{{cite journal

In order to reinforce the invisible Siyag fence and sedentarize the Bedouin, the State employed a reining mechanism, the Black Goat Law of 1950. The Black Goat Law curbed grazing so as to prevent land erosion, prohibiting the grazing of goats outside recognized land holdings.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Since few Bedouin territorial claims were recognized, most grazing was thereby rendered illegal.

Most Bedouin who had the option, preferred not to register their lands under the Ottoman rule as this would mean being taxed without representation or services. Those whose land claims were recognized found it almost impossible to keep their goats within the periphery of their newly limited range. Into the 1970s and 1980s, only a small portion of the Bedouin were able to continue to graze their goats. Instead of migrating with their goats in search of pasture, the majority of the Bedouin migrated in search of wage-labor.&lt;ref name="manski1" /&gt;

In the mid-1970s Israel let the Negev Bedouin register their land claims and issued special certificates that served as the basis for the "right of possession" later granted by the government. Following the signing of the Treaty of Peace with Egypt, it became necessary to move an airport from a [[Sinai peninsula]] to a locality inhabited by some five thousand Bedouin. The government, recognizing these land claim certificates, negotiated with the certificate holders and paid compensation to them. Most moved to Bedouin townships, built houses and established businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Yosef Ben-David. [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/Bedouin.html The Bedouin in Israel], 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli government has promoted the [[sedentarization]] of the Bedouin population. In 1963, [[Moshe Dayan]] said:
{{cquote|We should transform the Bedouins into an urban [[proletariat]] – in industry, services, construction, and agriculture. 88% of the Israeli population are not farmers, let the Bedouin be like them. Indeed, this will be a radical move which means that the Bedouin would not live on his land with his herds, but would become an urban person who comes home in the afternoon and puts his slippers on. His children will get used to a father who wears pants, without a dagger, and who does not pick out their nits in public. They will go to school, their hair combed and parted. This will be a revolution, but it can be achieved in two generations."|||Israeli General Moshe Dayan to ''Haaretz'', 1963&lt;ref name="manski1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Macintyre.[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/end-of-the-road-for-the-bedouin-517396.html End of the road for the Bedouin] ''The Independent,'' November 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Dayan added, "Without coercion but with governmental direction ... this phenomenon of the Bedouins will disappear".

The Bedouin communities in the Negev, many unrecognised by the Israeli government, were classified as "open areas" during the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]] and so their 200,000 residents did not have warning sirens or anti-rocket protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author1 = Jack Khoury | author2 = Shirly Seidler | author3 = Gili Cohen | last-author-amp = yes | title = Bedouin in south unprotected from rocket fire | newspaper = Haaretz | date = July 16, 2014  |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.605416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State treatment==

===Arrangement attempts===
In the 1970s Israel collected all the "claims of ownership" in the Negev, without permits and without proof, for the purpose of registering these claims. However, the Bedouin saw the state registry as a recognition for their claims. More than 3,000 ownership claims were filed for the land sized over 800,000 dunams, which includes nearly the whole area between [[Be'er Sheva]] – [[Arad (Israel)|Arad]] – [[Dimona]] and other areas throughout the entire Negev, including those that belong to kibbutzim and cities.

In the first years of the arrangement, anyone demanding area of over 400 [[dunam]]s had the opportunity to get 20% of the land from the [[Land Registry]], and for the rest of the area they would receive financial compensation. Anyone who demanded less than 400 dunams, had received only monetary compensation. In addition, the state of Israel compensated the Bedouin for any building, tin shack, barn or even a tree that the Bedouin placed and the government removed. The compensation value was even higher than the property's value in the market. In 20% of the claims the state has reached a settlement with the Bedouin.&lt;ref name="MMI" /&gt;

At the same time, some Bedouin tried to claim the land ownership in the court, despite the May 1984 [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] [[precedent]] ruling of Justice Avraham Halima, stating that Bedouin are [[nomad]]s by definition and thus cannot have any ownership of land.&lt;ref&gt;While the state is the owner of all the mawat land in the Negev as defined in the 1858 Ottoman lands ordinance and the 1921 British lands ordinance, unless the Bedouin have legal title deeds (Supreme Court, C.A. 218/74)&lt;/ref&gt; In all 80 cases in which Bedouin claims arrived to court, the judges ruled in favor of the state, since there was no document proving Bedouin land ownership. According to recent data submitted to the [[Goldberg Commission]] by the Bedouin Administration in July 2008, 2840 claims remained, whose overall area is 571,186 dunams.&lt;ref&gt;According to claims officer attorney Rami Damari. Goldberg committee report, [http://www.landpedia.org/landdoc/Analytical_materials/Goldberg_recommendations-english.pdf A land settlement], No. 34, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planned townships===
Dealing with the problem of the Negev Bedouin, between 1968 and 1989 Israel built seven planned townships especially for the Bedouin in the attempt to urbanize them.&lt;ref name="MMI" /&gt; The largest Bedouin locality in Israel, the city of [[Rahat]], was established in 1971. Other townships include [[Tel as-Sabi]] (Tel Sheva) (established in 1969), [[Shaqib al-Salam]] (Segev Shalom) in 1979, [[Ar'arat an-Naqab]] (Ar'ara BaNegev) and [[Kuseife]] in 1982, [[Lakiya]] in 1985 and [[Hura]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=Swirski/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Rebecca Manski.

===Abu Basma Regional Council===
{{Main|Abu Basma Regional Council}}
[[File:AlSayyid school4.jpg|thumb|left|A newly built school in [[Al-Sayyid, Israel|al-Sayyid]]]]
On 29 September 2003 Israeli [[Cabinet of Israel|government]] has adapted a new "Abu Basma Plan" (Resolution 881), according to which a new regional council was formed, unifying a number of unrecognized Bedouin settlements – [[Abu Basma Regional Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1196847418880&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/Printer Beduin in Limbo] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130706010434/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1196847418880&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/Printer |date=6 July 2013 }} The Jerusalem Post, 24 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This resolution also regarded the need to establish seven new Bedouin settlements in the Negev,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abrahamfund.org/main/siteNew/index.php?page=115&amp;action=sidLink&amp;stId=903 Government resolutions passed in recent years regarding the Arab population of Israel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207082421/http://www.abrahamfund.org/main/siteNew/index.php?page=115&amp;action=sidLink&amp;stId=903 |date=7 February 2012 }}, Abraham Fund Initiative&lt;/ref&gt; literally meaning the official recognition of unrecognized settlements, providing them with a municipal status and consequently with all the basic services and infrastructure. The council was established by the [[Israeli Ministry of Interior|Interior Ministry]] on 28 January 2004.&lt;ref name=MJB&gt;[http://brookdale-en1.pionet.com/files/word-documents/Abu_Basma_visit_highlights.doc The Bedouin Population in Transition: Site Visit to Abu Basma Regional Council] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928165539/http://brookdale-en1.pionet.com/files/word-documents/Abu_Basma_visit_highlights.doc |date=28 September 2007 }} Myers-JDC-Brookdale Institute, 28 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Israel is currently building or enlarging some 13 towns and cities in the Negev.&lt;ref name="MMI" /&gt; According to the general planning, all of them will be fully equipped with the relevant infrastructure: schools, medical clinics, postal offices, etc. and they also will have electricity, running water and waste control. Several new industrial zones are planned, some are already being constructed, like [[Idan haNegev]] on the suburbs of Rahat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bns-en.com/en-us/39/41/ Idan Hanegev Industrial Park]&lt;/ref&gt; It will have a hospital and a new campus inside.&lt;ref&gt;Itamar Eichner, [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4210642,00.html Harvard University makes aliyah], ynet, 1 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition vs demolition===
Israel is trying to solve the problem of unrecognized villages by attracting the scattered communities into government-planned townships and villages offering land plots at low prices&lt;ref&gt;In [[Hura]] an 800 square meters land lot costs 60–65 thousand shekels ($15–16 thousand) for clan members or 22 thousand shekels ($5.5 thousand) for a demobilized soldier. [http://abualkian.com/index.php/clan-members-transition-to-the-village-of-houra Clan members’ transition to the village of Houra]&lt;/ref&gt; and as an extreme measure – following the court order and all the legal procedure – demolishes houses built without state's permission on what it considers to be state lands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/01/israelandthepalestinians1 Rory McCarthy, "Nomadic bedouin fight to survive in the village which does not exist: Israel accused of discriminating against Negev desert clans"], ''The Guardian'', 1 April 2008; [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/925222.html "Bedouin village faces demolition due to new Jewish neighborhood"], Zafrir Rinat, ''Ha'aretz'', 18 November 2007; [https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/03/31/isrlpa18387.htm "Israel: End Systematic Bias Against Bedouin"], [[Human Rights Watch]], 31 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The unrecognized villages are not accurately marked on any official maps.
[[Image:Unrecognized demolished house2.jpg|thumb|Demolished house in the unrecognized Bedouin village of Alsara, January 2008]]
A number of villages has been recognized in the 2000s as a part of creation of the [[Abu Basma Regional Council]]. In 2009 the [[Goldberg Commission]] recommended that most of the 46 unrecognised villages east of [[Highway 40 (Israel)|Route 40]] should be recognised and their 50,000 illegal structures be legalized.

In 2010, Israeli authorities demolished the unrecognized village of [[al-Araqeeb]]. Since then it has been rebuilt and destroyed several dozen times (September 2012).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/06/13/220418.html Palestinian villagers demand Guinness entry for demolition record], [[Al Arabiya]], 13 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The matter of land ownership in the area of al-Araqeeb was raised in court when several members of al-Uqbi family filed a suit against the State claiming ownership of land.

The judge noted that the Bedouin knew they were supposed to register but did not.&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Post, "Court rejects 6 Bedouin Negev land lawsuits", 19 March 2012.

===Prawer plan===
In September 2011, the Israeli government approved a five-year [[economic development]] plan called the [[Prawer Commission|''Prawer plan'']].&lt;ref name="Prawer"&gt;[http://www.pmo.gov.il/English/MediaCenter/Spokesman/Pages/spokenegev110911.aspx Cabinet Approves Plan to Provide for the Status of Communities in, and the Economic Development of, the Bedouin Sector in the Negev], PMO official site, 11 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; One of its implications is a relocation of some 30.000–40.000 Negev Bedouin from areas not recognized by the government to government-approved townships.&lt;ref&gt;Al Jazeera, 13 September 2011, [http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/09/2011912151231223454.html ''Bedouin transfer plan shows Israel's racism'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guardian, 3 November 2011, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/03/bedouin-plight-traditions-threat-israel ''Bedouin's plight: "We want to maintain our traditions. But it's a dream here"'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the PMO official press release, the plan is based on four main principles: 
# Providing for the status of Bedouin communities in the Negev;
# Economic development for the Negev's Bedouin population;
# Resolving claims over [[land ownership]]; and
# Establishing a mechanism for binding, implementation and [[enforcement]], as well as timetables.&lt;ref name="Prawer" /&gt;
[[File:Tirabin al-Sana mosque.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Tirabin al-Sana's mosque (its [[dome]] taken from mosque in the previous [[Tarabin bedouin|Tarabin]] tribe residence place next to [[Omer, Israel|Omer]])]]
When the cabinet approved it, simultaneously it also approved a NIS 1.2 billion economic development program for Bedouin Negev whose main purpose is to support the Bedouin women and youth in the fields of employment since they will contribute to the increased economic growth of the entire Bedouin community. Much of the approved funds will be allocated for the development of [[industrial park|industrial zones]], establishment of [[employment center]]s and [[Professional development|professional training]].

According to the Prawer plan, the present Bedouin communities will undergo a comprehensive planning process. The existing communities will be expanded, some unrecognized communities will be recognized and start to receive [[public services]], while their infrastructure will be renewed. All these changes will be done in the framework of the Beer Sheva District masterplan. It's important to note that the nature of these future communities, whether agricultural, rural, suburban or urban will be decided in full cooperation with the local Bedouin. For those of them who are to be relocated, 2/3 of them will receive a new residence nearby.&lt;ref name="Prawer" /&gt;

The Prawer plan seeks to give an answer to numerous land claims filed by the Bedouin. It will offers significant compensation in land and funds – 50% of the claim (currently it's only 20% offered), while each claim will be dealt in a unified and transparent way provided by law.&lt;ref name="Prawer" /&gt;

Nevertheless, exists harsh criticism of the Prawer plan. Critics say that it will turn Bedouin dispossession into law&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternativenews.org/english/index.php/component/content/article/28-news/4109-bill-will-turn-bedouin-dispossession-into-israeli-law Bill will turn Bedouin dispossession into Israeli law] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424114822/http://www.alternativenews.org/english/index.php/component/content/article/28-news/4109-bill-will-turn-bedouin-dispossession-into-israeli-law |date=24 April 2012 }}, Alternative news, 2 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neve Gordon, [http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/04/2012421020291808.html Uprooting 30,000 Bedouin in Israel], Al Jazeera, 3 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and come to a conclusion that relocation of the Bedouin will be compelled.

There are several examples of success in this matter: after a number of complicated agreements with the state all of the Bedouin of [[Tarabin bedouin|Tarabin]] clan moved into a township built for them – [[Tirabin al-Sana]]. Following negotiations, the Bedouin of al-[['Azazme]] clan will take part in the planning of a new quarter that will be erected for them to west of [[Segev Shalom]] township, cooperating with The Authority for the Regulation of Bedouin Settlement in the Negev.&lt;ref&gt;Yanir Yagna, [http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/education/1.1745154 For the first time: Bedouin to take part in planning of their new neighborhood] (Hebrew), [[Haaretz]], 1 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main hindrances in finding a solution for the illegal settlement is the [[Bedouin systems of justice|Bedouin Tribal Law]] which states that one should not settle on a land that other Bedouin claims to own it.&lt;ref name="sof"&gt;Arnon Sofer, [http://www.inn.co.il/News/News.aspx/217597 Bedouin coming to Tel Aviv], [[Arutz Sheva|Channel 7]], 29 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the head of the unrecognized villages – Hussein Abu Pia testifying in front of the Goldberg Committee members: "If the land is in a one Bedouin's claim of ownership, the other will not come close. He would not dare. He will prefer to live in a cave, instead of approaching the land".&lt;ref name="kalm1"&gt;Kalman Libeskind [http://www.nrg.co.il/online/54/ART2/133/497.html Negev going lost: How the state failed to treat the Bedouins of the South]. [[Nrg Maariv#Online version|NRG]], 16 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a common phenomenon of the Bedouin who receive compensation and new homes in legal towns, yet return and construct again in state lands thus not fulfilling the agreements signed with the government. They were paid a compensation for relinquishing their claims to the state, but still claim ownership on the land to other Bedouin, so the problem remains unsolved. The town of [[Kuseife]], for example is built almost entirely on lands claimed by different tribes, and thus two-thirds of the city is empty.&lt;ref name="kalm1" /&gt;

Bedouin lands' claims don't take into account central planning issues. When agreement made, the Bedouin receive 20%–62% of the land they claimed. These lands are speckled with those registered in the Land Registry as belonging to other Bedouin. As a result, state encounters a serious problem developing Negev. Due to this issue, it is not possible to develop the eastern part of the [[Be'er Sheva]] metropolitan.&lt;ref name="lirit"&gt;[[Prawer Commission|Ehud Prawer]] and Lirit Srafis, [http://www.dukium.org/user_uploads/pdfs/%EB%F0%F1%20%E4%F8%F6%EC%E9%E4%20%F1%E5%F4%E9.pdf Negev Bedouin, policies, problems and recommendations], January 2006, National Security Council {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to government sources, another hindrance in the arrangement attempts is the absence of deadline for the negotiations.&lt;ref Name="bringer" /&gt; According to Prof. Sofer: "Bedouin always say 'no' to attempts to reach a compromise with them about the lands that they claim, because they know that every 'no' only strengthens them. One of the main problems in this program is lack of a final date. The state should set a date by which it is willing to give increased compensation for those who erase the claim of ownership, and from there on – no more compromise and a confrontation is needed even if it will come at a high price."&lt;ref Name="bringer" /&gt;

According to officials involved in negotiations, there is a lack of consistency in granting compensations. The Bedouin Administration manages negotiations with each tribe or family separately, soo the compensation size differs. Conciliatory families receive lower compensation, while the recalcitrant families' compensation is higher (a good example is the evacuation of the Bedouin [[Tarabin bedouin|Tarabin]] from the outskirts of [[Omer, Israel|Omer]]). The state also offers higher compensations to families with a leader that the government needs him by their side, or to families that claim land ownership in the areas of special importance to the state.&lt;ref name="kalm1" /&gt; One of the reasons for the lack of uniformity is the crisis of the Bedouin community leadership. Currently there is no agreed Bedouin leadership to resolve the land issue, and the Bedouin refuse to place representatives on the ground, so there is no authority to represent all of the claimants.&lt;ref name="kalm1" /&gt;

Another factor hindering the arrangement is tribal feud. According to one of the negotiators, attorney Itay Bar, Southern District Attorney for Civil Affairs, "Sometimes you can not place one Bedouin next to another because his son insulted him 20 years ago".&lt;ref name="kalm1" /&gt;

According to Faisal el-Husael, the public representative from the Bedouin inside the Goldberg committee,&lt;ref name="Goldberg" /&gt; often the Bedouin are not willing to relocate to planned towns since they prefer rural settlements to semi-urban townships.&lt;ref name="alhozeil"&gt;[http://www.izsvideo.org/videos/full/g151.pdf Protocol of Goldberg Committee for proposing a policy of regulating Bedouin settlement in the Negev], [[Haifa University]], 15 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

===High natural growth===
Illegal villages are a deteriorating problem and one of the reasons is the high population growth. The Negev Bedouin have one of the highest rates of natural growth in the world, standing at 4–5.5% per year,&lt;ref&gt;Evgenia Bystrof, Arnon Soffer, [http://web.hevra.haifa.ac.il/~ch-strategy/images/publications/demography_2007_en.pdf Israel: Demography and density. 2007–2020]. Chaikin Geostrategy, [[University of Haifa]], May 2008, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avinoam Meir, Dov Barnea, [http://cnp.nonuniv.ox.ac.uk/pdf/NP_journal_back_issues/The_Educational_System_of_the_Israeli_Negev_Bedouin_A_Meir_and_D_Barnea.pdf The educational system of the Israeli Negev Bedouin], p.25&lt;/ref&gt; which means doubling the population every 12–15 years.&lt;ref name="MMI" /&gt; So while in 1951 they numbered 12,000, in 1970 – about 25,000, in 1990 – about 87,000 people, and in 2008 – approximately 180,000. In 2020 are expected to reach 400,000.&lt;ref Name="iba" /&gt;

In 2008 [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] informed that fertility rate among the Arab population in the south of Israel (primarily Bedouin) dropped from 9 children per woman in 2003 to 7.6 children in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;Shahar Ilan, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/cbs-reports-drop-in-ultra-orthodox-fertility-rate-1.237112 CBS reports drop in ultra-Orthodox fertility rate], [[Haaretz]], 13 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; but it still remains high relatively to other population groups inside Israel.

The high fertility rate for Bedouin is exacerbated by polygamy (up to 36% of Bedouin men are polygamous)&lt;ref name = "iba" /&gt;&lt;ref name="poli"&gt;Committee on the status of Women, [https://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/pdf/m01600.pdf Polygamy among the Bedouin population in Israel], Research and Information Center Committee&lt;/ref&gt; and illegal infiltration estimated at 16,000 women who had infiltrated for polygamy (until 2004) and were accompanied by their families.&lt;ref name="iba" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Arnon Sofer and colonel Gil Shalev, [http://web.hevra.haifa.ac.il/~ch-strategy/images/publications/give_back_palistine_claim.pdf Actual realization of the "right of return" PA], Chaikin Geostrategy, July 2004, on [[University of Haifa]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Israel together with leading figures in the Bedouin community initiated a state program to address the phenomenon of Bedouin polygamy and its severely harmful implications on family structure.&lt;ref name="Alg"&gt;[http://www.algemeiner.com/2013/06/18/israel%E2%80%99s-negev-facing-alarming-changes Israel’s Negev Facing Alarming Changes], [[Algemeiner Journal|Algemeiner]], 18 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Bedouin advocates argue that the main reason for the transfer of the Bedouin into townships was demographic.&lt;ref name="alternativenews.org"&gt;BUSTAN on the Blueprint; Excerpt of [http://www.alternativenews.org/english/index.php/component/content/article/16-news-from-within/749-news-from-within-vol-xxii-no-8-october-november-2006.html Rebecca Manski, "The Rising Role of American Money in Negev Development"]; ''News from Within,'' October/November 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; They note that in 2003, director of the Israeli Population Administration Department, Herzl Gedj, described [[polygamy]] in the Bedouin sector as a "security threat" and advocated various means of reducing the Arab birth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merip.org/mero/mero060106.html|title=Middle East Report Online - Middle East Research and Information Project|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Shai Hermesh]], the treasurer of the [[Jewish Agency]], told ''[[The Guardian]]'': "We need the Negev for the next generation of Jewish immigrants" and added, "It is not in Israel's interest to have more Palestinians in the Negev."&lt;ref name="McGreal"/&gt;  Bedouin rights groups opposed this plan, as they were concerned that the unrecognized villages might be cleared to make way for Jewish development and potentially ignite internal civil strife.&lt;ref name="alternativenews.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neohasid.org/negev/resolution|title=NeoHasid.org - Ohalah Resolution on Blueprint Negev|author1=David Seidenberg|author2= Shir-Yaakov Feinstein-Feit|author3=  FourWorldsDesign.com|last-author-amp= yes|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Orenstein, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/841397.html "When an 'ecological' community is not"], ''Haaretz''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://neohasid.org/negev/brous "Brous' Open Letter to the JNF"], ''Baltimore Jewish Times,'' January 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011 the government decided to establish seven new agricultural settlements in the area of Mevo'ot Arad. On 14 August 2012, residents of five unrecognized Bedouin villages, along with residents of Arad, the [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]] (ACRI), [[Bimkom]] – Planners for Planning Rights, and the Negev Coexistence Forum for Civil Equality, petitioned the [[Israeli High Court#High Court of Justice|High Court of Justice]] against the plan saying that it will uproot 800 Bedouin.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acri.org.il/en/2012/08/14/acri-petitions-high-court-to-stop-government-plan-to-build-seven-new-settlements-in-around-arad-at-existing-residents-expense/ "ACRI Petitions High Court to Stop Government Plan to Build Seven New Settlements in Around Arad at Existing Residents’ Expense"], Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), 14 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acceleration in illegal construction===
Israel has encountered a problem of maintaining law due to uncontrolled illegal construction in the Negev Bedouin dispersed communities.&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.landpedia.org/landdoc/Analytical_materials/Goldberg_recommendations-english.pdf Section 67 in Goldberg report]: "These basic norms of adhering to the law have been eroded in the pzura (dispersals), in particular in all matters concerning illegal building which has reached enormous proportions. The Bedouin justify this through the needs of a growing population to have a roof over its head. In the absence of any alternative, and as they cannot receive planning permission in the villages, they have no alternative, so they claim, but to build illegally"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 there were 290 illegal structures in the dispersed communities, in 1956 – 955, in 1994 – 12,000, in 1998 – 24,225, in 2004 – 42,561, and in 2011 – 64,000.&lt;ref&gt;Section 68 in Goldberg report&lt;/ref&gt; Between the years 1998–2001, the demolition of illegal buildings stopped as a government policy and gradually resumed later. Law enforcement has failed, and there is no viable option to destroy all illegal construction. The threat of destruction does not deter residents from illegal building.&lt;ref&gt;Section 69 in Goldberg report&lt;/ref&gt;

According to enforcement officials, it is not possible to monitor every case of illegal construction because the residents who build in the dispersed communities impose on the inspectors criminal and terrorist threats.&lt;ref&gt;According to the testimony of Brigadier General Menashe Arviv, head of the Coordination of enforcement activities in front of members of the [weblaw.haifa.ac.il/he/Faculty/Kedar/lecdb/general/protocol.doc committee headed by Justice Eliezer Goldberg]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Commissioner of Administrative Enforcement Shlomo Cizzer: "We evacuate only intruders who have a place to live, we have evacuated, and will re-evacuate, the people who invaded [[al-Araqeeb]], because they have homes in [[Rahat]], [[Lod]], and in [[Kafr Qasim]]. They invaded just to prove ownership of the land. There are tens of thousands of others who are also criminals whom we do not evacuate, because they have no other houses to go to. Until the state decides what to do with them, we will act in accordance with the law ".&lt;ref name="tani"&gt;Tani Goldstein, [http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3944146,00.html Is there a solution to the problem of the Negev Bedouin land?], [[Ynet]], 28 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological issues===
While Bedouin take up open spaces that could be used for touristic purposes and construction of towns to accommodate new settlers, prominent Israeli environmental figures argue, that unapproved construction of unrecognized villages are an environmental hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manski|first=Rebecca|title=Bedouin Vilified Among Top 10 Environmental Hazards in Israel|url=http://www.alternativenews.org/english/index.php/aicafe/103-topics/news/825-bedouin-vilified-among-top-10-environmental-hazards-in-israel-825|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115084009/http://www.alternativenews.org/english/index.php/aicafe/103-topics/news/825-bedouin-vilified-among-top-10-environmental-hazards-in-israel-825|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 January 2014|publisher=AIC|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ecologists say that Bedouin communities are causing damage to ecosystems since the Negev has unique habitats. There is a transitional area between the desert and the border region of the south of [[Judaean Mountains]] and [[Shfela]], where most plant and animal species perform a gradation between habitats. Therefore, this zone is vital for them, especially during the [[global warming]] when species of the desert are expected to migrate to the north.&lt;ref name="eco"&gt;Dotan Rotem (open areas ecologist division of science from the [[Nature and Parks Authority (Israel)|Nature and Parks Authority]]), and Azri Alon (Southern District Planner in Nature and Parks Authority), The ecological effects of the Bedouin dispersals of the Negev, February 2012, Ecology and Environment Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

The keeping and feeding livestock bring steady amounts of vegetation food that grow wild and bring about consolidation of invading flora species. The Bedouins keep livestock in herds greater than the [[carrying capacity]] of the land, which leads to serious overgrazing, and to the creation of vast areas of empty of any plants. The cumulative effect creates huge areas where there is no vegetation at all (not natural and not agricultural) and no animals. In fact, the result is an ongoing and total destruction of habitat. Species unique to the region as ''[[Pterocles]]'', [[houbara bustard]], [[leopard fringe-fingered lizard]] and [[iris (plant)|iris]]es, disappeared from large surfaces.&lt;ref Name="eco" /&gt;

Illegal gas stations in the Bedouin dispersed communities&lt;ref name="dele"&gt;Gadi Golan, [http://www.israelhayom.co.il/site/newsletter_article.php?id=17957&amp;newsletter=08.06.2012 Disaster on the way] 08/06/12, Israel Today&lt;/ref&gt; represent a threat to the quality of air, soil and groundwater as fuel tanks do not meet basic standards of environmental protection meant to ensure that the fuel does not soak into the soil and groundwater, as well as the fuel itself does not meet environmental standards.&lt;ref name="delek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4322005,00.html|title=ynet פונו תחנות דלק פיראטיות בישובי בדואים - כלכלה|work=ynet|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="delek2"&gt;Doron Herman and Hila Shai-Vazan, [http://news.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=806633 Illegal gas stations in the South sell fake and dangerous diesel fuel], Nana10, 08.06.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Itamar Ben Dodi from the [[Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel]], the lack of sewage infrastructure and waste removal and illegal slaughter houses in the Bedouin dispersed communities cause an accumulation and spreading of [[wastewater]] and household waste that reach streams channels and cause odor nuisances, health problems for residents, and damage to nature.&lt;ref&gt;According to the testimony of Itamar Ben-David, a planner from the conservation department in [[SPNI]] in front of the Goldberg committee, 13 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 Israeli government ordered to allocate [[New Israeli Shekel|NIS]] 40 million for garbage pick-up and recycling for the Negev Bedouin communities in the area of the Al-Kasom and Neveh Midbar regional councils – for the first time. The main reason for the lack of garbage collecting services was unresolved land ownership disputes. Some homes in the area do not have legal standing and consequently do not pay local taxes which leads to the lack of income for the local authorities to operate garbage collection services.&lt;ref&gt;Zafrir Rinat, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.535758 Some 30,000 Bedouin to get garbage collected for first time], [[Haaretz]], 15 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of Israelis, including both Bedouin and Jews, are settled in some 2.5% of the [[Negev]] desert available for civilian use living in proximity to Israel's [[nuclear reactor]]s, 22 agro and petrochemical factories, an oil terminal, closed military zones, quarries, a toxic waste incinerator ([[Ramat Hovav]]), [[cell tower]]s, a power plant, several airports, a prison, and two rivers of open sewage.&lt;ref&gt;BUSTAN on the Blueprint; Excerpt of [http://www.alternativenews.org/english/index.php/component/content/article/16-news-from-within/749-news-from-within-vol-xxii-no-8-october-november-2006.html Rebecca Manski, "A Desert Mirage: The Rising Role of American Money in Negev Development"]; ''News from Within,'' October/November 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this infrastructure is concentrated on the grounds of the unrecognized village of [[wadi al-Na'am|Wadi el-Na'am]]. According to the [[Ministry of Health (Israel)|Ministry of Health]] data (as of June 2004), the rates of cancer and mortality are 65% higher for those living within a 20&amp;nbsp;km radius of the Ramat Hovav Industrial Zone. Some 350,000 people live within this danger zone, including the residents of Beer Sheva.&lt;ref name="Am"/&gt;
